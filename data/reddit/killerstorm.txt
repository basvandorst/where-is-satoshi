Hacking 7 enterprise IT systems is much harder than hacking 1 enterprise IT system. BFT systems aren't a panacea, but they are an improvement.
In practice, private keys might be protected by hardware security modules and stuff like that.
You can also anchor blockchain state in the Bitcoin blockchain. By combining several consensus systems in an additive way you make the whole system more secure.


If we are talking about enterprise applications, if existing centralized systems are "good enough", then an advanced BFT system will be good too, because it is strictly better when well-designed.
If we are talking about cryptocurrencies, then it's still an open question.

You can get more capacity if you sacrifice decentralization. It's a trade-off.
E.g. BitShares blocks are being validated by a bunch of witnesses (delegated PoS). They can easily afford 3-second blocks.
It's natural that different blockchains use different trade-offs as they have different goals.

Actually I mostly agree with Andreas. If I remember correctly, he compares private blockchains to LANs, while public blockchains are the Internet.
But LANs are pretty useful too. For example, my university used to have a fairly decent LAN but shitty external Internet connection. LAN was great: it allowed us to play Counterstrike, share files. University's exam software worked on LAN.
So what this comparison tells me is that public and private blockchains can co-exist. Perhaps 50 years from now we will all be using public blockchains, but we aren't there yet.

If you use M of N consensus plus anchoring to the Bitcoin blockchain, an attacker can pull off a double spend (transaction reversal) attack only if he BOTH 
 * compromises M nodes
 * successfully attacks Bitcoin via a 51% attack (or a double spend) 
at the same time.
Otherwise, if attacker just compromises M nodes, anchoring still makes sure that there is only one version of history.
If Bitcoin blockchain is attacked but the majority of nodes are fine, you just have delayed confirmations or something like that.

This one: "suppose banks A, B, C decided to share some database between themselves. If C's IT team fucks up, whole database might get corrupt."

 * Monero is just one of cryptocurrencies implementing [CryptoNote ring signature algorithm]( Monero isn't the first coin of this kind, they just have the best marketing team.
 * Dash doesn't have any special privacy features on a blockchain level, their privacy is based on CoinJoin facilitated by specially designed 'Masternode' servers.

A properly designed decentralized BFT system will become corrupt only if the majority of participants are dishonest. It's much better than trusting a single entity.
Also, while it is possible to receive a cryptographic proof (certificate, evidence...) from a centralized source, it's not a norm. Thus cryptographic evidence is another benefit of blockchains. So, basically, if somebody tries to fuck with you, you get a hard evidence that he did, and can go to court.
So "blockchain" is often just a code word for "getting a better use of cryptography". 


LOLwut. BFT systems are supposed to be able to tolerate a certain number of arbitrary bad failures, that's what they do. 


No, it's not. You just need to run a single node per company, how is that expensive?
If you use a middle-man he will charge an extra just because he can.

"SPV proof of possession" is probably just a clumsy wording. Most likely there will be a special kind of a "withdraw transaction", and SPV proof will prove that it have happened.
Covenants are probably unnecessary if reorganization proofs are implemented natively. E.g.  a process of claiming funds on the main chain will create a special kind of an UTXO which can be destroyed with a reorganization proof.
However, it's possible that the developers will choose to implement sidechains with as little ad-hoc constructs as possible. In that case they will need to extend Script's capabilities to be able to recognize SPV proofs and reorganization proofs. In this case a covenant might come handy.

If you share it, it will be less secure.
E.g. suppose that probability that one company's database will get corrupt due to a hack within a certain timeframe is 1%.
Suppose that there are 10 companies which want to have a common database, and since they are equal, they want every company to have complete access to the database. Hence failure of a single company will corrupt database for everyone.
So now probability of a database getting corrupt is ~10%. It's 10x more likely to get corrupt.

The core of Steem's economy is redistribution, which is sustained by a speculative demand.
This won't work on a sidechain. Basically you'll just see your stash of bitcoins slowly evaporating. Who wants that?

Banks already have a system in place with which they can transact with each other in any currency.
E.g. if there is bank X which is trusted by banks A and B, they can settle a payment through X. They do so by sending messages.
In theory, permissioned blockchains might allow them to move money faster.
If you're asking whether they can transact USD without relying on US banks, then the answer is "maybe". Ultimately you need an US bank to make USD tokens "real", and thus US government will have its influence.

You suck at abstract thinking. 
Before you compile code you need to get it from somewhere.
You need to have a specification to be able to check whether software conforms to the specification. So where do you get that specification form?
Imagine if there are several web sites which have different specs. Which of them are you going to pick? (Actually in case of Bitcoin code is the specification, so it boils down to finding the correct code repository.)
Certainly it's not a hard problem to solve, if you engage with community you will know that code is hosted on  is the current version, and  isn't. But you can solve the PoS bootstrapping problem in exactly the same way.
For example, reddit wiki [has hashes of the latest Bitcoin Core release]( If Bitcoin was PoS-based, it will also contain hashes of some recent block. So you just verify hash of the recent block in the same way you verify hash of client build (or source code).
In both cases you need some social knowledge: you need to know who are the developers, what block explorers are reputable, what exchanges are reputable etc. If you have that knowledge you can solve both Bitcoin PoW bootstrapping and PoS boostrapping.
If you have no social knowledge you might end up using some weird fork and get scammed. So requirements for PoS and PoW are the same.


Wrong. Attacker might give you the correct blockchain except the last 6 blocks, for example.


If you have an ambient knowledge, PoS bootstrapping isn't a problem either.


How is that different from PoS bootstrapping problem?


It definitely is, if you don't know a node you can trust you can totally get a wrong blockchain. And it's not a highly theoretical issue like rewriting whole PoS chain history using ancient keys, it's a practical issue which can be demonstrated with existing Bitcoin Core software right now.
So I see a lot of hypocrisy: you complain loudly about a theoretical issue, but choose to ignore the practical one.


Wrong. Ripple consensus model is immune to that. PoS is resistant.
This problem is tightly connected to the fact that Bitcoin miners are supposed to be anonymous, and thus you aren't supposed to know anyone's identity, and thus you cannot know whether the chain you got is the real one.
@_date: 2016-08-16 13:03:12


The chain itself can be secured using anchoring, it can be very safe. The question is how bitcoins are escrowed. If bitcoins are stolen, Coinbase cannot restart/backup or whatever. Neither can a federated chain.

There are no _really good_ PoS implementations right now. So right now PoW cost is justified. Maybe in 10 years it will be demonstrated that PoS is good enough.
PoW also has many problems. E.g. right now Bitcoin can be attacked by hacking into as little as 20 systems, maybe: just hijack servers used by major miner pools. It will be a temporary, but successful attack.
20 is a conservative estimate. Might be as little as 5.
So there are reasons to research things other than PoW. Like a PoW+PoS combination, like I did.
@_date: 2016-08-25 09:15:55


No, it's not. Typically you would want to combine anchoring with BFT consensus.


Nope, you'll be better off using a normal database and implementing a custom synchronization and validation layer on top of it. Which is basically what a private blockchain is.
"A normal distributed database" won't do the validation at the point you want it to, so it's useless here.
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:30:55


No, they don't. Miners will see regular multi-sig transactions. I think you misunderstand what is meant by a "federated 2-way peg".


It is a risk people have to accept. As theymos have explicitly mentioned, it will be a chain for pocket money, not for savings.
@_date: 2016-08-25 14:10:51


How do you make sure that a "linked database" on a single node will commit a transaction if and only if enough other nodes commit it?


It reduces overhead.
But if you don't care about overhead you can use PBFT. I don't mind.
Perhaps some PBFT-based systems are marketed as blockchains.


Maybe. If you want your system to be audit-able from the start, you might not want to keep 10 signatures for each row in the database.
There might be some difference in DoS-ability. PBFT replicates client messages before they are being applied. This means one client can flood the network with junk messages.

"Nothing at stake" was originally "defined" by Gavin Andressen [here]( relevant part:


This isn't very precise, but he talks about miners and stakes, which implies that the stake is current. Thus he is talking about short-range attacks.
If the stake is still active, it can be confiscated.
Costless simulation is a different kind of an attack, it works with stakes which have existed in the past, and thus cannot be confiscated. The protection against costless simulation is limit on the depth of reorg.


No. 


Did you consider a possibility that it is you who has rather severe misconceptions?
How long I've been a part of the community is irrelevant here, what's relevant is that I've been researching PoS since 2012 and co-authored two peer reviewed papers.
Perhaps you should also check [Poelstra's 2015 article]( Notice how he no longer mentions "nothing at stake", but instead costless simulation and  “Long-Range” versus “Short-Range” Attacks.
In the end he agrees with Vitalik's weak subjectivity:


model from that of Bitcoin. New users who encounter multiple histories are no longer able to
distinguish them on their own; they need to ask existing participants in the network (which may
include friends and family, large corporate entities with reputations to maintain, public websites,
etc.) which history they know to be the true one.

Maybe you should learn how Bitcoin transactions work before posting bullshit.
Fees are not created out of thin air, transaction fee is a difference between the sum of inputs and the sum of outputs. So fees work on sidechain just fine.
E.g. suppose Alice deposits 1 BTC to a sidechain, sends it to Bob paying 0.001 BTC fee, Bob will get 0.999 BTC. Bob can now withdraw that 0.999 BTC, and federation nodes get 0.001 BTC, which they can withdraw too. Total amount of bitcoins is always conserved.

Several years ago Peter Todd [posted his analysis of a blockchain as an cryptographic abstraction]( That is, what role does a blockchain play in a crygtographic protocol if all implementation details are abstracted out? Turns out, there are two possible roles:
 * anti-replay oracle, i.e. it prevents double-spending
 * proof-of-publication, i.e. making sure that all participants receive all the relevant information when they want to
Obviously, Satoshi designed a blockchain as an anti-replay oracle, but later it turned out that it can be used for other cool things it wasn't designed for. So another possible way to look at it is that proof-of-publication is blockchain's main role, and anti-replay oracle is derived from it.
I think these two roles can come handy when analyzing blockchain use cases. Particularly, we can go through "scarce assets" mentioned in the article:
1. Value: You want anti-replay oracle to prevent double-spending, and you want proof-of-publication to be able to figure out what's wallets balance or who's asset current owner in a reliable way
2. Identity: proof-of-publication might be relevant as users need to know when a certificate was published, who and when have signed it, whether a revocation was published.
3. History of facts: that's what proof-of-publication is, basically.

I don't think you understand Byzantine fault tolerance. Suppose you're running a cluster of 5 nodes. An attacker gets in a control of one of them. He won't just shut it down, he will try to corrupt data, he will send corrupt requests to other nodes and so on.
To protect against that you need to cryptographically sign every change by a majority of nodes. Every node must check signatures before applying changes.
NoSQL databases are optimized for speed, but not for security. They assume that the worst thing which might be happen to a computer is that it will be shut down. They do not expect corrupt data.
I don't claim I know all NoSQL databases, though, if you know one which offers Byzantine fault tolerance I'd be glad to learn about it.


That's very nice, but Raft isn't BFT. It will fail if attacker gets control of a single node.
There is a BFT-hardened Raft variant called [Tangaroa]( but I don't think any of databases uses it. Also it doesn't do deep validation which blockchains do.

I think non-monetary blockchains are interesting, it's basically linked timestamping + replication for everyone. So it essentially hardens security against various attacks, improves availability, etc.
[Certificate transparency]( is probably the best example.
I'm not sure whether these non-monetary blockchains will enable new things which do not exist now. That's possible in theory (e.g. when there's too much distrust for a centralized solution to emerge), but I don't know any "sure thing".

magnet link can be published in OP_RETURN. Then at least you can be sure that everyone gets the same link.
You can model the update process using a colored coin: if there is a unique colored coin associated with the content, then you can be sure that there is always just one current confirmed version, and the history is unambiguous.

It can be done fairly well using protocols like PBFT.


Depends on what you mean by a big scale... Older BFT protocols aren't designed to work in open systems, yes.
Otherwise, PoS is also shown to work. Maybe on a smaller scale, but still.


In my opinion, to qualify as a blockchain system needs a consensus algorithm which selects which chain is current.
So if you add a consensus algorithm on top of git (e.g. by requiring each commit to be signed by N of M validators) it might be considered a blockchain.

Fee is paid for each transaction output moved. It means that first buyer pays to move his txout to merchant, then merchant pays to move his txouts to an exchange.
So if this merchant will use his own Bitcoin wallet, first his customers will pay $8000 in fees, and then he will spend $4000 on top of that to move coins to an exchange.
If merchant uses BitPay he doesn't need to worry about this second fee, but BitPay has its own fee.

Limited capacity, costly transactions, only tiny amounts of data can be embedded into transactions, lack of support for custom transaction semantics.

You can only insert 80 bytes of data.
If you insert just hash, as a result you get what I would call an anchored blockchain. It's a sensible approach, and generally private blockchains can be hardened via anchoring.

Banks do a lot of different things with blockchains. For example, they define derivative contracts using Ethereum Virtual Machine. In that case payout is computed deterministically and is fully transparent for all participants
Moreover, they can allow their customers to define custom contracts while still making sure that everything remains correct. Since it is all done in software, there is no need for legal contracts, it's just code.

Back in 2011 I implemented one of the first derivative trading services for Bitcoin. My first version used a shared wallet, it worked for a few weeks, but then I shut it down due to security concerns.
For the second version I planned use of multi-sig. I've never actually implemented that, but I'm quite certain it's possible.


Yes. The simplest thing to do is to keep funds which aren't involved in any trade in users' personal wallets. If they are held in multi-sig, BitFinex would not need confirmations to move funds around.
I really doubt that 120k BTC was all on orders, so that can be prevented.


if you don't see how it could work that doesn't mean it's impossible. Generally for better security you need to sacrifice some convenience.
The problem with companies like BitFinex is that they operate like traditional financial institutions without having the protections which traditional financial institutions have: non-anonymous accounts, reversible payments. This is a recipe for a disaster.
Please don't tell me that cold storage is bulletproof.
My opinion is that these companies should operate as services rather than as institutions. They should make use of the technology, even if that means that they can't use exactly the same contracts as traditional institutions are using.

It can become much worse. We would like to prevent a catastrophical situation where a single cartel, or even just a single entity, will control all the mining, and thus the blockchain. If that happens, Bitcoin becomes all but useless.

Banks need to trust each other to some extent. If bank C doesn't trust bank A, it will refuse to accept Bank A's tokens to its account, but will instead require bank A to get bank B's tokens instead.
But this is how it _could_ work. It's essentially [Ripple]( model. But it's just one of things banks might use blockchain for, there is a plenty of other things.


No, and it doesn't look like they're going to use a global banking blockchain.
Ripple have been trying to pitch their global banking blockchain to banks since 2012 or so, they spent millions of dollars just on sales, and it doesn't look like there is a lot of progress.


Yep. Getting bank A's tokens is basically same as getting a message "You can now redeem $100 through bank A".
EDIT: Just to clarify, my company doesn't make settlement systems for banks.

Such as...?


They are definitely correlated: both are designed to implement secure, fault-tolerant distributed systems. Both are based on a replicated state machine model.
But I agree that something should be called a blockchain only if it has a chain of blocks. The biggest project in this space, Hyperledger, has blocks and uses PBFT.

 * [pbft](
If you have further problems with it, please contact IBM.


More messages need to be signed and sent. And, potentially, stored. Do you know how PBFT works?


Please read the PBFT paper and then use basic arithmetics to calculate numbers.


There are many reasons. It just works better this way.
Interblock times cannot be made arbitrarily small, thus if there was just one transaction per block the capacity would be limited.


Satoshi mentions overhead in the paper:


generated every 10 minutes, `80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB` per year. With computer systems
typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of
1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in

It's not safer than a database, it is a safer database.


The blockchain itself won't be corrupt because every node validates every transaction.
Of course, an attacker can move money which belongs to C (for example), but it's a different story.


You might demand that every transaction needs to be signed by corresponding account owner.
You can also implement various safeguards, like multi-sig, mandatory delays and so on.

I watched the whole video. 
The relevant part is a segment from 55:15 to 59:15, called _Classically simulating Quantum Computers_. Vitalik refers to a number of papers implying that it might be possible, at least for some circuits. Particularly, [Gottesman–Knill theorem]( is a well-known result, the rest of the papers attempt to transform an arbitrary circuit into one which can be efficiently simulated.
Vitalik mentioned some startup which is working on it.
But he also compared this to a perpetual motion machine, like there is always some issue which prevents it from working. So it seems he's realistic about it.
The rest of the video is a pretty sensible lecture on quantum computing in connection with Bitcoin, i.e. how to harden Bitcoin against it and so on.

I don't know for sure, my understanding is that Chain started by making an OpenAssets implementation with some nice API and a sandbox (i.e. bitcoin regtest mode).
Then they discovered that none of the big guys like NASDAQ really care about Bitcoin, they just do experiments, and a sandbox is fine.  So this "colored coins in a sandbox" became a private blockchain solution.
Now they have more stuff, i.e. features you can't do with plain colored coins, it's a part of consensus, so no longer colored coins. Very little information is available, but they say it uses UTXOs, so it was definitely influenced by colored coins.
Same thing with Digital Asset. They actually released their source code as a Hyperledger project submission, so we can see how it works. Apparently they started with colored coins, then moved them to their private blockchain. But they still use Bitcoin transaction format, with OP_RETURN and everything. But I guess their nodes validate colored coin transfers.
Same thing with MultiChain. We haven't seen their code, but they say it's based on Bitcoin Core, and they previously did colored coins, so again it's a private chain/colored coin hybrid.


Tech-wise colored coins are OK, but the problem is that nobody is really interested in making consumer-oriented stuff. Companies which were working on colored coin implementations noticed that the market is small and it's hard to make significant amounts of money on it, so they mostly went on to do other stuff.
Particularly, none of the companies have bothered to release a decentralized or trustless exchange. It can be a source of legal problems and it's not a sure thing in terms of monetization. So companies just avoid it.
We, ChromaWay, nominally have p2ptrade as a part of ChromaWallet, but we aren't marketing ChromaWallet. so very few people know about it.
Without a decentralized exchange colored coins aren't very interesting. So it looks like Counterparty and Omni are slowly gaining momentum, while colored coins aren't going anywhere.
Counterparty might be technically inferior, but they have nice wallets and tooling.

I don't think that "constantly securing their bitcoins" is a good idea. They should just implement a good scheme once, at start.

Suppose that a lot of Bitcoin whales would like to exchange their bitcoins for gold for some reason.
It is true that the bitcoin price won't be affected if bitcoins and gold will just change hands. I.e. a person who owned bitcoins will now own gold, and person who owned gold will own bitcoins.
But wait a minute, why would a gold seller want to own bitcoins? They generally don't.
So if people will start changing their bitcoins for gold the price of bitcoin will drop.
It might work through several intermediaries, e.g. one might sell gold for bitcoins, then sell bitcoins for dollars, then buy more gold with those dollars and sell it again. "sell bitcoins for dollars" is the part which causes price to drop.

1 satoshi per bytes is so low that most nodes on the network will just ignore your transaction.

And how do we "allow a 2-way peg"?
If we create a concrete sidechain using a soft-fork, then it is basically identical to increasing block size w.r.t. miner centralization pressure.

The advantage is that it is 100% optional, voluntary and easy to implement. Also, has well-understood security properties. And instant confirmations.

It is... What's in your bitcoin.conf?


Yes, it is. That's because it's quite big: your transaction is 46 times bigger than a typical transaction.
That's because you received this sum as 78 individual small payments. Bitcoin fees are based on the size of the transaction, which is affected by the number of inputs, and each individual payment you receive becomes an individual input.
Thus there is essentially a fee associated with receiving bitcoins, but it's paid only when you try to spend.
If you received this sum as a single payment, your fee could be as little as $0.012, i.e. about 1 cent. That's almost free.


No. People who said that were lying to pump the price up, or were just clueless. None of so-called "Core developers" or experts who actually know how shit works said that payments were free.
Fees are used to pay for Bitcoin security, maintaining security of a decentralized system is costly.

OK, in simple words, we are trying to make replication secure.
Suppose you launch a new node and it receives data from one of old nodes which currently holds a complete dataset. An old node can simply send all rows to a new node, that's easy.
But what if an old node was compromised and will send wrong rows? Can you fix that using hashes?
No, not really. If an attacker controls an old node, he will just recompute hashes with corrupt data, and a new node will know no better.
To make sure your data is correct you need cryptographic signatures. E.g. suppose you've received 1,000,000 rows, so you get a hash at 1,000,000s row. Then you ask 10 other nodes what is their hash. They send you a cryptographically signed message which says "the hash at row 1,000,000 is abc". If you also have the same hash, then you know you have the right data, assuming that the majority of other nodes aren't compromised.
But you want data to be in sync on all nodes. So you can do this kind of replication process continuously, continuously validating cryptographic signatures of state hashes as new transactions come.
If you do this correctly, you get a Byzantine fault tolerant system. This is basically what private blockchains are.


Nobody says that a "private blockchain" cannot be based on Oracle, but Oracle doesn't come with BFT sync out of box, as far as I know.
It's not new, systems like that were implemented in 1999 (PBFT), although it wasn't a complete database but just sync algorithm.

There are definitely some advantages in having just one cryptocurrency/blockchain. And since there are efficiency advantages, things are naturally geared in that direction.
But this also creates "too big to fail" problem.
Many people have turned to Bitcoin because they didn't like "too big to fail" treatment banks are getting. So it's really ironic that so-called Bitcoin maximalists are aiming to create another "too big to fail" entity.
They might say that it's different because Bitcoin is trustless/decentralized/cryptographic/whatever. But the question is, can it fail? There are dozens of academic articles describing possible failure modes. If you think it can't, perhaps you should try to learn more.
Bitcoin maximalism is a reactionary ideology of Bitcoin early adopters trying to replace bankers in their thrones.

This depends on your security assumptions.
The problem with hardware wallets is that they are the perfect target for a malicious code, and it's pretty much impossible to ensure that wallet isn't compromised. Popular hardware wallets might be securing hundreds of thousands of bitcoins, and in theory a single employee can steal all that money. That's just too lucrative.
This risk cannot be measured. Hardware wallets might seem perfectly secure until we will see a massive theft.

The output of a transaction on the sidechain can commit to a particular address you want to send main chain coins to. Then anyone can create a receiving transaction, but only as long as coins are sent to the rightful owner, as address is already locked.
This is more efficient, as in this case Bitcoin unlock script doesn't need to validate any signatures. There is just no point in validating them: address is already fixed, and script gets an SPF proof that the sidechain miners have validated the signatures.
Note that if the sidechain miners are dishonest, signature verification isn't going to help, as sidechain miners can create a fake transaction using fake UTXOs and get in confirmed. They will be able to sign whatever is needed. Thus this extra signature verification has no benefits.


Normally UTXO is just an outpoint and script. But UTXO structure can be extended to support metadata which is necessary to verify reorganization proofs (or lack of thereof).
So, basically, sidechain withdraw code will be implemented in C++ rather than in Bitcoin Script.

Bitcoin requires additional properties: anonymity, open participation and censorship resistance. 
This is MUCH more complex than implementing a BFT system for a limited number of participants.
Enterprise systems do not require anonymity, open participation and censorship resistance. So they can get away without native tokens.
These things are just in different categories, it makes no sense to compare them.


PBFT was described 17 years ago.


No processing power is necessary. A private blockchain can be altered in a bad way only if the majority of participants agree, i.e. are compromised. That's the level of security it offers. Additionally, you get a cryptographic proof of wrongdoing even if the majority is compromised.

Obviously, they won't replace their core stuff with a technology which is very new and immature. They might try first to bring it to something which is relatively unimportant. Also they need to make sure that it's compliant with regulations.

Nothing-at-stake is easy to fix: penalize signing conflicting blocks by confiscating stake. That's the whole point of stake.
As long as the majority of stake-holders are honest, they will be happy to penalize the minority if it chooses to disrupt the blockchain.
A more serious issue with PoS is a complete rewrite (also known as "costless simulation"): attacker can acquire old keys which were used to sign blocks in the past and rewrite the whole blockchain. Nodes can protect against it by limiting max reorganization depth.
As for new nodes which do not know which version of the history is a true one, they will need a trusted node to bootstrap. Vitalik calls this weak subjectivity.

1. Theymos doesn't propose that this chain with 10s of controlling entities to replace Bitcoin, it will be explicitly inferior to the real Bitcoin, but superior to centralized services like Coinbase.

If you only store a hash you need a separate system to store the actual data. Then you need a system which will control which hashes go into the Bitcoin blockchain, which use these hashes to validate data and so on. Also you need replication.
So "just use a hash" is not a solution. You need a lot of software to make it work. But yes, it's possible.

As an additional protection in case when the majority of nodes can be compromised. This can be some systemic failure like OS vulnerability which will affect all nodes at the same time. Or a HSM vulnerability if a HSM is being used.
With anchoring you can be sure that there is "last known good state" which is rather recent.
But I think that anchoring won't be the base of a consensus algorithm but an additional check. I.e. if system detects a discrepancy using anchoring, it means that something went horribly wrong and automatic recovery is impossible. So a system should just indicate failure and notify human operators.

I [tried to introduce]( term "side-chain" for what now would be called an anchored blockchain. It seemed like people had no problem with it, Gregory Maxwell and Peter Todd can be seen in this thread using the term.
So I was really surprised with sidechain announcement, it took me some time to figure out that they use this term differently.


Well, looking how the term caught on, it seems people like it. Sometimes they even call things which aren't colored coins (i.e. user-defined assets in general) colored coins.
I actually tried changing it when Colu claimed that Colored Coins is their brand: I introduced a more general concept of generic coins and then, maybe, overlay coins for what we call colored coins now. But it was a half-assed effort, so didn't work.
But anyway, it seems like colored coins are on a way to become completely irrelevant, so you aren't going to hear this term a lot in future...

He proposed using them to query transactions. Presumably it was to preserve privacy of SPV wallets.
Later it turned out that it doesn't really improve privacy compared to a direct address query (a la Electrum), but it massively increases load on full nodes as Bloom queries cannot be indexed.

Which question? As a person who started the discussion I have a better idea what it is about.
The question is what's the best way we can do using only SSL. Obviously, PGP is more suitable for that, but what's  the best you can do using only SSL?
So my point is that with hardware security mechanisms you can actually do quite well. 


Yes, the problem with SSL is that signing must be done online, while PGP signature can be done offline. This is the only relevant difference.
You can mitigate security issues of online signing using hardware security mechanisms.

This is what private blockchains are, basically.


Right. 


An approach for building Byzantine fault tolerant systems which involves batching validated transactions into blocks which are then connected into a chain. A consensus algorithm is run on block level rather than on transaction level.
This is somewhat different from older PBFT approach which has no batching and runs final validation only after the ordering of messages is agreed upon.

It depends.
In a private blockchain, one of validator nodes will make a block and other nodes will agree on it. Ripple also works in a similar way, perhaps you should check their paper on consensus.


Yes, it's relatively slow, but it's fine for some uses. For example, BitShares is a public blockchain which produces blocks each 3 seconds. It's good enough to enable a decentralized market which works more-or-less in a real time.

Well, there is some truth to it, as it's been going for 2-3 years and yet there still no clear commercial projects involving private blockchains, only pilots and PoCs.
I won't bet that such use cases won't appear in future, though. They might come from two directions:
1. Hardening security. In theory, a centralized database can do everything what a private blockchain can do, but the question is what happens if a server hosting such a database gets hacked. A private blockchain can mitigate certain classes of attacks. So it's an incremental improvement.
2. A common database for a group of companies. Current approach is to create a new company (e.g. SWIFT was created to take care of interbank communications) to take care of it, but a private blockchain might be cheaper/better.

There are things like smart cards, HSMs, TPMs and so on which make sure that even a person who has physical access to hardware cannot steal private keys.
If you trust the security of a hardware solution, then you can make a secure web server serving dynamic content. You need to implement content update policy within the secure hardware, and you have to implement parts of HTTPS server within the hardware, but it's not impossible. But you also have to trust CAs if you assume that users have default browser configuration. (There are actually some promising ways to harden security against rogue CAs, e.g. [1]( [2](

I think it's OK if an application is centralized but trustless. That it, it should require only a minimal amount of trust from user. One example is GreenAddress wallet: signing service is centralized, but you have a refund transaction. So if the company disappears you will still get your money back after some time. And the company cannot steal your funds (unless it releases a malicious software update, but that's a problem even with 100% open source decentralized apps).
Another possible model is to make core software fully decentralized, but offer additional value-added services.
Another possible monetization model is an app-coin: software might be decentralized, but require some kind of token to operate. That's not cool but better than nothing, I guess. Perhaps it's possible to make a more reasonable appcoin model which won't drive a lot of speculation.
Finally, sometimes centralized applications are OK, e.g. when decentralization is impossible or is impractical. One example is Coinbase: while LocalBitcoins offers a more decentralized approach, Coinbase is much more convenient.


Neither Electrum nor Mycelium are decentralized, but they are trustless (assuming software works as advertised).
Electrum needs to connect to a server, but since you have choice and can run your own, it's almost decentralized.
Mycelium is not decentralized, it connects to Mycelium backend. And it has some revenue model, I think they charge a fee on LocalTrader trades. There is also integration with Coinapult which probably brings some revenues too.

If ether is a native cryptocurrency which can be used in smart contracts, and Bitcoin is one which cannot be (or, rather, supports only limited kinds of contracts), then clearly ether is in an advantageous position.
It is very natural to copy that feature and let Bitcoin to be used in smart contracts too.


Rootstock will exist in its own blockchain with its own blocks and rules. They can set confirmation times arbitrarily low.

You do not understand how Bitcoin works. Merchants do not time out transactions after they receive an unconfirmed transactions.
Inter-block intervals are random, and intervals longer than 50 minutes happen once per day on average. If a merchant or a payment processor time out a payment after 50 minutes, they will fail users who did nothing wrong: sometimes you can't get it confirmed no matter what fee you pay. (And note that this has nothing to do with blocks being full, it's a direct consequence of parameters chosen by Satoshi.) And it's not a rare freak occurrence, it happens every day.

Well, for one thing, Bitcoin is much less restrictive than TransferWise.
For example, TransferWise won't allow a company to pay a freelancer in countries like Brasil, Russia, Ukraine etc. It is a very common case for a cross-border payments, yet TransferWise [can't do that](


So, perhaps, it's one of the problems Bitcoin solves: the problem of stupid government restrictions. 
Oh, it also has lower fees than TransferWise. E.g. a TransferWise fee for sending $1000 would be $5, while Bitcoin fee for sending $1000 worth of bitcoins is like $0.05. A hundred times lower.

It was founded by Bitcoin Core developers who were dead set on developing open source software aligned with **long-term** success of Bitcoin. VCs who invested were well aware of it, so they don't expect it to drive significant revenues in a typical time frame (~4 years).
I've also heard from some sources that Andreessen Horowitz considered funding a Bitcoin development non-profit, with no expectation of a direct return. So I guess they are OK with not getting returns from Blockstream for some time as well.

JavaScript is irrelevant here. Browser extension can be implemented in C, or JS can use crypto functions which are implemented in C, or JS JIT compiler might produce machine code of acceptable speed.
But CPU might be much slower than GPU/FPGA/ASIC, that's true.
Usual way to address this is to use memory-hard hash functions, which reduce the difference between CPUs and more specialized devices.
But there is another approach which is currently under-researching: using dynamically generated or self-modifying code. E.g. a hash of the content can be used to generate code according to certain rules, which is then run in a loop million times, for example.
FPGAs and ASICs achieve higher efficiencies by unrolling loops on the bit level and doing exactly the operations which is needed by the hash function. This will be impossible if code is dynamically generated, so you have no choice but to implement some sort of CPUs to do it. You might be able to stuff many such CPUs on a chip (as they are much more specialized than Intel CPUs), but the speed difference won't be as huge.
Differentiating from GPUs might be more problematic, as GPUs are now quite like massively multi-core CPUs. But you can still find something which they do relatively inefficiently and do that as much as possible.

It is just that over the decades nobody found a way to break it.
People generally assume that discrete logarithm problem and number factoring are NP-hard, but it's not proven. Besides that, it's not proven that `P =/= NP`, thus even if they were NP-hard we cannot prove that there is no clever algorithm which can crack them.

The argument is completely ridiculous. It's obvious that only new nodes might be confused by a rewrite-the-whole-history attack. And this issue can be solved in an obvious way.


This is strictly weaker than Bitcoin's trust model ONLY if you start with assumptions that attacks on Bitcoin are impossible and attacks on PoS are possible. This is a ridiculous way of begging the question.
Bitcoin trust model has several MAJOR weaknesses:
1. User needs to know where to download software from. Is the version from bitcoin.org OK? Should he trust Gavin Andresen's signature? This essentially requires "user to be around during system setup or trust a friend to" get the current version of software.
2. We generally assume that the network user connects to might be potentially controlled by the attacker. Thus a user who synchronized a full node can never know whether he actually gets the real Bitcoin blockchain, or something an attacker gives him.
Core devs' approach to address these issues is "it's impossible to solve them, so let's just ignore them". This might be a sensible approach for writing software (although I don't think that  can't be solved), but it's a absolutely disingenuous to do that when you're writing an academic paper.
Now if we look at the whole picture:
1. User needs to get software from a trusted source, so he might get latest block headers from the same source. So, PRACTICALLY, PoS is not weaker than PoW. But THEORETICALLY it is possible that a source which is good for validating software is not good for getting trusted headers.
2. Let's consider two situations: a) user cannot trust the node bootstrapping process, then neither PoS nor PoW is safe; b) user uses a trusted party during the bootstrapping process, then both PoW and PoS are safe. Thus PoW and PoS are equally safe.
After the bootstrapping phase, PoS is actually more resistant than PoW to network-level attacks.

There are no fundamental technical issues with a decentralized social network,  the main problem is that it's going to be less useful and convenient than a centralized one. So until everybody hates Facebook it can only attract privacy freaks.
It's worth noting that Web itself is a decentralized social network of sorts. You can get like a half of Facebook's functionality with just blogs and RSS subscriptions. So there's no pressure to build a "decentralized social network".

If you have N pre-defined validator nodes, a BFT system can tolerate up to N/3 failures. E.g. as long as 7 out of 10 nodes remain honest, the system will keep working.
Bitcoin is interesting because it doesn't require a fixed set of validators, also validators can be anonymous.
If you don't care about anonymity, but want a BFT system, you can just use one of BFT consensus protocols.
So a private blockchain is typically a complete working system which has a BFT consensus protocol in its core. 


Wrong. Price of hardware can be arbitarily low. Profit gained by damaging the system can be amplified by derivative markets (margin trading, futures, options...). It can be trivially demonstrated that under reasonable assumptions Bitcoin can be undermined.


Nothing-at-stake is a problem of early naively-designed systems, it was fixed years ago.

No. There might be free market solutions to it.

2. It would make sense for users to avoid VC-backed companies. There are rational reasons to do it: a centralized VC-backed company is likely to go bust, sell your data, etc. So users should prefer organically-grown or decentralized applications.

That's definitely not Bitcoin (SHA256^2) mining. Maybe they mean Litecoin or Ethereum hashes, those are much bigger. Or maybe it's a scam and they didn't bother to make up realistic numbers. (Many of "cloud mining" companies are scammy: they take your bitcoins and give you some fraction back.)
You can find actual numbers here: 
One gigahash will give you 0.00009174 BTC per month.
It makes no sense to mine Bitcoin on GPU as there are ASICs which do it much more efficiently. But there are other cryptocurrencies which you can mine on your GPU and then convert them to Bitcoin. There are pools which do that automatically: you receive Bitcoin payouts even when you mine other currencies, and you don't even need to know what you mine :D
EDIT: HashOcean FAQ mentions scrypt, it's the algorithm used in Litecoin. But that's kinda weird since Litecoin ASICs already exist and are more profitable than GPU.

If Alice's computer is compromised it affects both PGP and SSL in the same way.
When attacker has access to Alice's computer, he can do many different things:
1. Steal her private key.
2. Change the content of files on disk.
3. Modify executables.
Just to help you visualize this, suppose Alice types a message and clicks 'sign'. But an email client patched by the attacker will silently replace the message and sign that. Thus Bob will get attacker's message instead of Alice's message. Note that this kind of an attack works even if Alice's private key is encrypted or resides on a HSM.
Obviously, no protocol can be useful in a case where one of endpoints is sufficiently compromised. Thus when we are discussing protocols we shouldn't iterate through all possible cases (there are millions of them), there are just two cases:
1. Alice's computer is NOT compromised, in that case communication is secure assuming that the protocol is secure.
2. Alice's computer IS compromised, in that case communication is NOT secure regardless of what protocol you use.
Thus, again, if computer is compromised then both PGP and SSL will be affected in the same way.


It makes no sense to consider this case. "The content is changed" generally means that a computer is compromised. In a general case Alice will have no capacity to verify the content. E.g. if the content is a binary file, is Alice supposed to know it by heart? This is ridiculous.
It seems like you already recognize that SSL is equivalent to PGP when Alice is actually a script.
But Alice being a real person doesn't change anything about protocols. Alice can actually use HTTPS instead of PGP for interactive communications. E.g. Bob will post his request over HTTPS. Alice will manually type the message and put into a directory which is served by HTTPS server.
So again, protocols generally offer a similar level of security, but the way they are used differs, which affects security. E.g. HTTPS is typically used on a server residing in a datacenter, and thus there is a bunch of ways this server might be compromised. If it's a cloud server, it's even worse. But it has absolutely nothing to do with the protocol itself.


This is why I wrote: assuming CA is not compromised. There are actually some plugins which helps in the case CA is compromised.


Yea, but this isn't what we were talking about.
If one is using only Wladimir's keys to verify Bitcoin Core binaries, he will be duped if Wladimir's computer is compromised. So fundamentally you're just one hack away from malware unless you check using multiple sources (e.g. gitian signatures).
You assume that Wladimir's computer is more secure than the bitcoin.org web server, which is probably the case, but this assumption makes no sense when we are comparing different protocols.

Even something as simple as multi-sig, while Bitcoin supported it from day one, it was a bitch to implement as one needs to handle transaction proposal and signature transportation. So no wonder it took many years until Bitcoin users could actually use multi-sig.

Colored coins can be exchanged using atomic swap transactions, which are trustless. Thus, in theory, anybody can provide an exchange service.

So it's possible in theory, but quite cumbersome. Creating a decentralized exchange wasn't a goal, it's an unintended consequence. :)

An example of doing it right: currently 24 volume on Poloniex exchange is 41956 BTC. They take 0.3-0.4% fee, so they earn something like 125 BTC per day, or 46000 BTC per year assuming same volume. That's almost 20 million dollars at today's exchange rate. 
Poloniex doesn't work with fiat money, it's essentially just a piece of software which works with cryptocurrencies. So quite likely a large fraction of those 20 million dollars is company's profit. (I don't think that hosting, maintenance and support are terribly expensive.)
Poloniex never took VC money as far as I can tell.

Because in practice there are many venues through which people can cross-check and validate implementation. E.g. imagine bitcoin.org is compromised. In that case people will expose that on reddit. Obviously, reddit doesn't control Bitcoin either.
But trust model of obtaining code and configuration is completely out of scope of cryptocurrency design. We just assume that people get trusted code and configuration from somewhere. In reality they can complex decision making process which involves PGP, gitian, github, word of mouth, web sites, forums, etc.


There is no such thing as perfect trustlessness. People just want to require as little ad-hoc trust as possible, completely automating trust after you got initial configuration.
So de-facto you have two stages:
1. Get trusted code and configuration. How trust works on this step is very complex and user-dependent.
2. Run code. Now trust is algorithmic and can be easily analyzed.
So people make an argument that step  is not needed for Bitcoin but needed for PoS. This is false. In fact you can use same mechanism.
E.g. how do I know Bitcoin Core binaries are safe to run? I check that they are signed by maintainers, who used gitian deterministic build process to agree on hash.
Exact same process can be used to sign PoS bootstrap configuration: a bunch of authorities will sign configuration hash.
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:34:54


It has everything to with PoW. It's impossible in other consensus models such as Ripple and DPoS.


Weak subjectivity isn't a problem.
Both PoW and PoS requires trusted code and trusted configuration.


You need trusted setup with PoW too: you need to receive rule set and genesis block hash.
Even that is not enough. If you have just the code and genesis block hash, you might be eclipse-attacked at negligible cost.

Nope. Satoshi never used proper game theory terminology.
It seems he just had a great intuition about these things.


assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to
find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.
This is a very hand-wavy thinking. And yet, it worked.

I'm a co-author of a [Cryptocurrencies without Proof of Work]( paper was recently peer reviewed and presented at FinCrypto Bitcoin Workshop. In this paper we explained possible attack vectors and ways to mitigate them.
It's not the state of the art, however, there might be better schemes, such as Ethereum's Casper, maybe.
It's worth noting that there are many problems with Bitcoin PoW, e.g. [bribery attacks]( So i think it's disingenuous to dismiss PoS just because it's not perfect.
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:12:51
In the original version of Bitcoin, double-hashing happens in three places:
1. in PoW function
2. Merkle tree
3. addresses
I believe for PoW it might be actually useful. For Merkle trees it slows computations down with no advantages whatsoever.
For addresses it's kinda more nuanced as use of two different hashes makes preimage attacks harder and collision-like attacks easier. So I'm not sure it's harmful.
@_date: 2016-04-24 22:28:57
It might be not so simple in presence of stop orders and margin calls. You can intentionally trigger them to profit when they execute.
E.g. suppose you know that there is large number of stop orders triggered at $455. So you push it up to that amount and then stop orders push price further. So you can sell back at a higher price.
Same thing about forced liquidation: it's a positive feedback, you only need to give it a nudge.

Satoshi didn't need VC funding to create Bitcoin. Bitcoin Wallet for Android was developed without funding of any sort. Many other wallets are developed by volunteers. The original Bitcoin tipping bot was developed by a single guy and didn't require VC funding.
If you look at it closer, pretty much all important developments were done without VC funding.
I really don't care about code developed by ChangeTip, it's not open source and I don't see how it benefits the Bitcoin ecosystem.
If ChangeTip didn't exist I'm sure other developers would have stepped in, and perhaps we'd have a better solution by now.

Federation nodes can actually just steal Alice's 1 BTC as soon as she deposits. E.g. if it is 7-of-10 multisig, they just need 7 signatures to steal coins. They don't need to create any sidechain blocks, transactions or anything.
So there is no point in making a sidechain block with subsidy. Sidechain nodes will see it as an invalid block.
If a majority of federation node will collude to accept that invalid block, they might as well just steal all the escrowed money without any ceremonies. So this isn't a new attack vector, we just require the majority of federation nodes to be honest for it to work.

Yes. It's supposed to be a cryptocurrency with a secure decentralized consensus which makes it easy to send and receive payments on resource-constrained IoT devices. It does NONE of that:
1. It's quite poor as a cryptocurrency. Winternitz one-time signatures are a bad choice, 100% not needed now. (For the record, I think quantum-resistance is good, but currently you can use hybrid signatures, i.e. an address which can be used both with EC and quantum-resistant signature schemes. So it might use EC now and upgrade to Winternitz OTS once quantum hacks appear. This makes blockchain more compact and gives you time to polish wallet to be OTS ready.)
2. Not secure. There is no evidence that amount of PoW generated through transactions on IoT devices will be enough to secure blockchain against attackers with ASICs and botnets.
3. Not decentralized. Relies on a trusted coordinator. There's no proof that consensus model even works, it's just guesswork.
4. Sending a payment is significantly harder than with Bitcoin. Wallet must be stateful, thanks to bad choice of signature scheme. It requires PoW, which is problematic on a resource constrained device. It requires knowledge of the graph. (While Bitcoin requires only knowledge of your own coins.)
5. Validating received payment is problematic because of a lack of SPV.
In my 6 years working with cryptocurrencies I've seen many half-assed projects. But this really takes the cake. It fails on EVERY point.
But that's not all. IOTA guys also make a number of claims:
1. They claim that IOTA somehow solves problem with IoT security. This isn't substantiated in any way. IOTA is only about sending payments, it has nothing to do with security of devices.
2. They claim it can be used for IoT data transfer and collection. Again, no evidence it's any good for that.


Well Bitcoin kinda sucks too, but at least it's good in some way.


No, Bitcoin is already useful in the capacity I'm using it in: storing value. I don't expect Bitcoin to be able to do cheap and quick payments.
Bitcoin works amazingly: it didn't just store, it multiplied the value.

This app has absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin as a currency. It uses Bitcoin blockchain, but all payments are denominated in euro. This is possible via a colored coins tech.

Payment processors which work with Bitcoin have to understand how Bitcoin works and adapt their logic/scripting to it. If they can't, they shouldn't accept Bitcoin.
Would you agree that timing out a payment if it's not confirmed in 5 minutes would be utterly fucking idiotic? What's about 10 minutes? That would fail at least a half payments!
If a payment processor can't adapt their logic to how Bitcoin works they shouldn't work with it.

The thing is he's not the first to "reinvent money". Chaum described anonymous money back in 80s, and since then there was a steady stream of articles about crypto currency.
Variants described by Szabo and Dai are quite close to Bitcoin, and Finney even implemented a PoW-based currency (PoW was used to mine coins but not to secure the network IIRC).
So it was interpreted as some variant of Dai's design. There is usually some kind of a flaw which isn't obvious from the start. For example: "Why would anybody care to use such a system?". (It was actually the case for ~1 year of Bitcoin's existence when it wasn't considered being more than a cool concept.)
So this kind of a lack of interest is understood and justified. It's hard to be excited when the thing was already being discussed for decades...

That's one of theories.
2013 wasn't just a time after halving, it was the time when ASIC miners were introduced. Some miners/companies were able to get those ASIC miners first, they were mining LOTS of bitcoins and didn't need to sell them as electricity costs were minimal.
However, the fact that people were buying mining equipment for bitcoins had the opposite effect.
All in all, we can only speculate about causes.

There's a thing which many users do not know: merchant also pays a fee to collect the payment.
E.g. suppose 100 users sent their payments to merchan's wallet. This created 100 UTXOs on the blockchain. Now to sell that on exchange, merchant needs to spend those 100 UTXOs, and it will have a huge fee.
So the situation for merchants and payment processors is MUCH WORSE than people think. They pay fuckton of money to accept BTC.
On the merchant side fee is roughly the same as on user side. So if you paid $5 transaction fee, merchant also nees to pay about $5 to process that payment.

XRP pump shows that the new generation of cryptocurrency investors are so confused they don't even understand what's a cryptocurrency. XRP was originally not even supposed to be used as money, it was just an anti-spam measure. Later they said that it might be used as an intermediate step of exchange. E.g. suppose somebody wants to exchange Nigerian naira for Korean won, there might be no NKN/KRW pair on the market, but if there's NKN/XRP and KRW/XRP, trade can be made. Currently, USD is used for that, and it's not clear why gateways would prefer XRP to USD if USD exists in Ripple system, it's pretty ambitious.
So XRP wasn't even supposed to be a coin you buy burrito with, or keep savings in.
Now people assume that if Ripple Inc works with banks this means that XRP is going to be a bank-endorsed coin. There's no evidence supporting this. Banks work with Ripple's private network and they couldn't care less about XRP. Ripple Inc still has more than 60% of all XRP in its coffers, and I think banks aren't stupid enough to give a startup company an ability to mint the new world currency. Like, why?
There's no evidence of banks using Ripple public blockchain. You can see a list of XRP markets on Ripple web site:  Bithumb, Binance, Bitfinex, Poloniex... Those are all crypto exchanges, not banks.
i won't be surprised if it's just few whales trying to corner the market, but in that case Ripple Inc is in this, since they essentially already have the market cornered.
On the other hand, Ethereum is legit:
 * it does more transaction per day than any other blockchain (AFAIK)
 * it's a de-facto standard for ICOs which have been a very big in 2017; e.g. in Russia ICO funding was 3x VC funding
 * it has a working on-chain trustless exchange
 * there are thousands(!) of projects in the pipeline
 * it's very popular among developers because Solidity is very easy to learn and there's a plenty tools
 * while there's no one "killer" dapp, some non-ICO dapps are pretty successful, e.g. CryptoKitties got into the mainstream media since it's gaming thing
I don't think Ethereum is perfect and I expect it to have problems with future, but it's clearly very big right now.

Lightning is useful only when merchants &amp; payment processors starts adopting it. Without that, you can only transfer between your own wallets, which isn't useful at all. (I.e. currently you can only masturbate using Lightning, or use that single site which accepts it on mainnet.)
For merchants, it makes sense in two cases:
 * repeated payments
 * micropayments without custodial wallet
Note that there are also downsides:
 *  before there's a well-connected network, money will be stuck in channels for significant time
 * merchant will have to lock their own coins in a channel to start it
So it doesn't make sense for merchants to adopt LN before it is able to generate significant revenue.
Best candidates for adoption are services which require frequent, repeated payments. E.g. pay-per-view sites, gambling, etc. But, still, cost of implementing is high.
For merchants, you can assume repeated use. But there are significant issues:
 * they need capital to fund opening channels
 * they open to a DoS via opening unneeded channels
 * they need capital to forward payments to merchants
 * OR convince merchants to delay settlement
So, yeah, I don't see payment processors adopting it anytime soon. Unless somebody starts a new payment processor specifically for Lightning and funds it with a lot of capital.
What exacerbates the problem is that payment processors do not cooperate. Coinbase and BitPay could have opened an accelerated payment channel between them years ago, but they don't.
Until you connect exchanges and payment processors into a single network you won't really have much -- or any -- benefits from LN. So you have an extreme case of chicken-and-egg, where it's not just not immediately useful, but requires billions dollars-worth funding until it becomes useful.

Have you tried doing math?
How large is a large reddit thread? How much time will it take to download it? Why do you need to download all comments if you aren't going to read all of them anyway?
Bandwidth isn't a problem. The actual problem is counting upvotes.
You cannot allow nodes to count them, and downloading each individual upvote can be really problematic. (And can be manipulated unless you implement a scarcity mechanism.)
This is why decentralized reddit is a hard problem, and you need to use a cryptocurrency-like approach.

BitFury used first two axes under different names in their [research papers](
 * Public blockchains are blockchains that grant read access and ability to create transactions to all users. Users can transfer value without the expressed consent of blockchain operators.
(Note that ordinary end users are not required to store any blockchain data.)
 * • Private blockchains limit read access to the predefined list of entities (e.g., blockchain operators
and auditors). End users need to rely on interfaces provided by blockchain operators in order
to read and submit transactions
 * Permissionless blockchains allow anyone to participate in building the blockchain. The core
property of these blockchains is censorship resistance, i.e., any valid transaction broadcast over
a permissionless blockchain network would be included into the blockchain. The term “permissionless”
corresponds to the fact that there are no blockchain-wide policies restricting the use of
the blockchain (although service providers can implement service-specific restrictions). Thus,
a permissionless blockchain is by definition free for entry / exit for end users and application
 * • In permissioned blockchains, blockchain building is restricted to a set of known entities. The
term “permissioned” reflects the fact that the entities building the blockchain may introduce
policies to arbitrarily censor transactions, therefore potentially restricting the blockchain use
by end users and application developers.
I think "tokenized/tokenless" axis is useful, but name isn't. Payments industry already uses word "tokenized" to mean "anonymized", so confusion is possible.

Mostly because of community's attitude towards ICOs.
The focus of Bitcoin community is Bitcoin.
The focus of Ethereum community is decentralized applications. Ethereum is a platform for decentralized applications, without applications it's not useful.
So people in the Ethereum community believe they _should_ invest into decentralized applications. And after initial price rise, they had capital to do so.
There were several sizeable ICOs on Bitcoin blockchain, e.g. MaidSafe was done on Omni platform. But TheDAO demonstrated how much capital Ethereum investors have, and from that point on it became a de-facto standard.

I'm highly skeptical because LN require huge amounts of capital locked in online wallets in order to work smoothly.
AFAIK there are no realistic models of network topology and payment patterns. It's hard to talk about it seriously when there's no well-understood model of operations, and it's by itself a huge red flag that it's not going to work well.
Federated sidechains might offer much higher capital efficiency and comparable security.
E.g. it's typically mentioned that large exchanges and payment processors will have LN channels with each other. E.g. Coinbase will have a channel with BitPay, BitStamp and so on.
It would be much more efficient for exchanges to establish a common federated sidechain. In that case Coinbase won't need to open a channel for each exchange, so there's less fragmentation and so on.

Disabled opcodes in script are still disabled.
There's a number of subtle bugs (odd behavior in corner cases) which became a part of consensus.
Transaction replacement logic was replaced with CSV and CLTV, which is on-chain. LN can also be seen as a continuation of work on transaction replacement.

There's a good evidence that it was just one guy: original code was written in a rather amateurish way. 
It wasn't particularly bad, just poorly structured. For a professional programmer, structuring code is a no-brainer, it doesn't really require any extra effort.
It is, of course, possible that NSA intentionally made it look amateurish, but why?
They really didn't need that to make a "lone genius" story. Why can't a lone genius write code like a pro? E.g. Hal Finney's RPOW code looks like it's written like by a UNIX programming veteran. If they wanted Bitcoin to spread, making it look amateurish didn't help their cause.
If I was NSA I'd pretend to be a cypherpunk. Cypherpunks would prefer POSIX to Windows, cli to GUI and C to C++. Satoshi did exactly the opposite.
Another thing is that initial version of Bitcoin had several problems:
1. originally it followed longest chain rather than a chain with most work
2. transaction replacement mechanism was broken, both from coding perspective and conceptual perspective
3. script evaluator had some dumb shit in it
4. several opcodes turned out unsafe and had to be disabled
5. originally Bitcoin supported pay-to-IP-address mode and P2PK scripts
I don't think any of this would pass a professional code review. If it was NSA, why would they plant this dumb shit?
On top of that, there's more rudimentary non-working cruft in Bitcoin 0.1 code base:
1. decentralized marketplace code, like OpenBazaar
2. poker (I haven't seen it personally but people say it's there)
Do you think NSA would plant some non-working marketplace code into their cryptocurrency project? Why?
All evidence says that Satoshi was just one guy who had some good ideas and some bad ideas, incredibly good intuition and some moderate coding skills.
Non-coders believe that Bitcoin 0.1 was some amazing alien technology. But if you are a professional coder, you can see that it was closer to projects you did in uni than to "amazing alien technology". The amazing thing about it is that this crap worked.

We already had that in 2012-2013. Colored coins, Counterparty, Mastercoin (now Omni).
Cryptokitties are definitely possible using a custom colored coins protocol.
But this doesn't play well with LN. The point of CryptoKitties is to put information into a blockchain to "materialize" it. I.e. if it's in blockchain, it's real in some sense.
LN does the opposite: it doesn't put payment information into the blockchain, keeping it in wallets.
So these things kinda defeat each other. LN+colored coins would be just a centralized database.
We need better understanding why we are even doing these things. Why are we putting kitties into the blockchain? Is there a point, or is it just a novelty?
If the point of kitties-on-blockchain is transparency, then we can make special transparency-sidechain for these kind of apps, i.e. "transparent apps", or tapps. But will people buy it? I'm not sure.
Aside from CryptoKitties, there are some interesting things enabled by Lightning, e.g. cross-chain currency trade.

Every scheme is vulnerable to a certain list of threats. The question is whether those threats are practical.
Early PoS schemes were vulnerable to a wide range of threats. Newer schemes are vulnerable to threats which might be considered impractical.
So I'm not convinced that PoS is broken in practice.


OK cool. In 2012-2014 I and other people (Iddo Bentov, Meni Rosenfeld, Charlee Lee) designed PoS/PoW hybrid with certain security properties. It's designed to withstand attacks where &gt;50% of hashrate belongs to attacker, and where &gt;50% of stake belongs to attacker (but not both at the same time). It seems to be immune to most pure PoS problems.
We abandoned further research and development because there were zero interest to actually get it into Bitcoin.
Core devs made a bet on sidechains. That bet failed. So what's next?
We need a consensus inside of the community that PoW is broken and desire to replace it. It seems most people would rather pump Bitcoin as _the best thing evar_ than admit a problem.

Usually professionally developed projects have clearly defined scope. If it's an implementation of a transport protocol it will not include any Facebook application.

How does it work that Bitcoin users download Bitcoin node code from bitcoin.org and not bitcoin.com?
Blockchains simply automate _human_ consensus, but ultimately they still rely on human consensus. We need consensus among humans to decide that Bitcoin Core is the real Bitcoin.
Likewise PoS coin users would need to form a consensus about corrupt validators. Node software can only automate detection, e.g. it can say that it's cryptographically proven that validators are corrupt. Then it's up to users to decide how to proceed.
Are you aware of Bitcoin chain split of 2013? It's very interesting scenario which reveals how blockchains **actually** work. There were two diverging Bitcoin chains for a couple of hours, until miners, users and developers made a choice and selected one of them.
You can read how the decision was made: people looked at what side the biggest exchanges are to minimize the damage.

Such as?
It seems people want to have _exact same properties_ as PoW, which is ridiculous, as PoW's properties are demonstrably bad.
Poelstra and Maxwell argued that the fundamental problem with PoS is that it requires trusted configuration. This seems to be a non-essential issue, if issue at all: in practice you already need trusted code and trusted configuration for _any_ consensus scheme. The only difference is that PoS configuration need to be updated, say, once per year, while PoW configuration might be one-time assuming that we never have hard forks.
If you go out of a Bitcoin bubble, you can see that hard forks are a reality, they are an essential mechanism of cryptocurrency governance. If you admit that, there's no practical difference between PoW and PoS on that: both require trusted code and configuration.
Some PoW cultists here argued that you don't need any trusted configuration and can just identify the chain with biggest cumulative work. I think now it's clear this is false.


PoW fundamentally has no anti-centralization properties. You have no guarantees you won't have one dude who owns all the mining.

Uh, what? 
The hash power is owned directly or indirectly by Bitmain, which is also an owner of pool and world's biggest manufacturer of Bitcoin mining devices, and also an entity which launched a hostile alt-coin which is competing with Bitcoin and tried to destroy Bitcoin a couple of times. EDA was specifically designed to starve Bitcoin hashrate to make it vulnerable.
So let's put it straight: Bitcoin miners are attacking Bitcoin. Bitcoin miners do not care about Bitcoin and would mine whatever is more profitable or whatever serves their goals.
This isn't a theory, this already happened in practice. Bitcoin survived largely undamaged (clogged mempool and drama have driven people away from Bitcoin, so damage is nonzero) through sheer lack and under-estimation on the side of attackers. (Also I'd assume stupidity. It seems that developers are largely altruistic so all capable developers avoid hostile projects.)


This is absolutely a problem with PoW. PoW's decentralizing forces are very weak and centralizing forces are strong. There is no reason to assume that PoW can be secure.


No, other systems have much smaller centralizing forces.


Those people are strongly biased and their arguments are very weak.
These people choose to ignore strong theoretical _and practical_ evidence that PoW is unsafe, but they at the same time tout highly contrived, theoretical arguments against PoS.
In PoS the "rich get richer" aspect is a design parameter which can be controlled. Rich get richer by a small amount (if at all).
In PoW it's uncontrolled, it's a matter of luck. A company which can create a more efficient mining chips and/or mine more efficiently gets higher profit margins, which let it optimize its mining operations even further, build even more equipment and further erode competitors' margin. On top of that, bigger pools get bigger profits (as proven by Peter Todd, for example). So you have a positive feedback loop where several factors work together to make a single company dominant on the market. On the other hand, there are almost no factors working in the opposite direction.
This already happened a couple of times. In 2013 ASICMINER made first chips and soon became a mining behemoth. Through sheer luck they fucked up something and disappeared.
Now Bitmain has 70% of equipment market.  This was entirely predictable feature of PoW: a company which has a tiny advantage can quickly amplify it through positive loop.
PoS doesn't have these feedback loops. Stakeholders might earn 1-5% per year, this won't lead to a runaway centralization. 
So intellectual dishonesty of PoS-skeptics is staggering, it's matched only by intellectual dishonesty of religious people. Thus I believe PoW is a cargo cult.


Not true. First, as I explained above, there are purely economical feedback loops. Second, there's game theory too. Bigger pools get bigger advantage. E.g. see here: 


But we already know that PoW is centralized and broken. This is a strong argument for PoS: we might not know some PoS flaw, but we already know significant PoW flaws. Thus...?


Depends on your definition, this looks like a No True Scotsman fallacy. There are many functioning PoS coins, e.g. BitShares. Not as big as Bitcoin, but few billion dollars big. And it exists for 3 years.
Bitcoin itself can be seen as proof-of-concept, since it's currently impossible to use Bitcoin for payments.
I'm not saying that we should switch to PoS right now, but people need to admit that PoW is deeply troubled and start seriously investigating alternatives.
I did research in 2012-2014. When we published PoA paper, the response was, basically "yeah, cool". There was no follow up discussion and no interest in considering adopting this approach. Instead of that most influential developers started touting sidechains -- completely unproven and unsound concept. So I personally got disinterested in continuing research. I'm sure if people were interested right now we could have a polished implementation of PoA with solid security proofs.

If stakeholders get corrupt you can replace them via hard fork. It's much easier and safer than hard forking into a different PoW.
And the effect in not worse than reorganizations which happen in PoW systems.

Downsides of decentralized exchanges which deal with fiat money:
 * if you trade frequently, you'll be considered a money transmitting business
 * your bank might find this suspicious and close your account
 * revealing your bank account to a stranger might have negative consequences if combined with other exploits
 * money you receive might be stolen, e.g. hacker will steal bank account credentials and use you to convert money from the account to bitcoins
 * three-way (MitM) scam is possible
How three-way scam works:
1. attacker (MitM) posts a bid to buy bitcoins, and at the same time sells something on craigslist
2. he instructs person who's buying on craigslist to send money to your account
3. you see the money and release bitcoins
4. guy who thought he is saying pre-payment for goods understands he was scammed and opens a case with police/bank
5. you're being investigated, might be required to return money
There were already cases like this on LocalBitcoins, I'm sure Bisq isn't any better.
So no, I don't think we should be pushing this. If you deal with fiat money then centralized exchanges are the best.

Because that's how it works. Money is moved within the channel. Moving money changes the balance.


A channel can't be "credited". It's only possible to change how money is allocated _within_ the channel, the channel itself doesn't change.
Suppose initially everyone puts 1.0 BTC into a channel.
So initially you have:
 * AB: Alice 1.0, Bob 1.0.
 * BC: Bob 1.0, Claire 1.0
 * CD: Claire 1.0, Dave 1.0
After a payment from Alice to Dave we have:
 * AB: Alice 0.5, Bob 1.5
 * BC: Bob 0.5, Claire 1.5
 * CD: Claire 0.5, Dave 1.5
So Bob got 0.5 BTC in AB channel and lost 0.5 BTC in BC channel. Everything is balanced.

It's not same as with ISP network. ISP only needs to lay cables once and can then use infrastructure for years. There's a limit how much data you can send per second, say, 1 gigabit per second. But you can send data continuously, it never gets exhausted.
LN is completely different. Sending money via a channel exhausts it, and it needs to be replentished by moving money into the opposite direction.
To go back to network analogy, suppose that after you watch a movie online you also have to upload a movie back to make it work again. It would be a lot of hassle, no?
Many businesses have very asymmetric and irregular payment patterns. E.g. proverbial coffee shop, they receive money each day, but they do not pay to suppliers each day. So channel needs big enough to buffer few days worth of payments.

DAG/Tangle is a scam. It is worse than blockchain in pretty much every way.
Blockchain is actually extremely efficient on verification side: you need about 4 MB worth of headers per year and 2 kilobytes per transaction. This is a tiny amount of data even for smartphones.
On the other hand, DAG/Tangle requires huge amount of data to verify a transaction.
In blockchain, all PoW is concentrated in block headers and only 4 MB worth of headers are produced per year.
In DAG/Tangle, if it's PoW-based, PoW is spread among millions of transaction, and you need to download all that data to verify it.
So it's ridiculously retarded idea, and only people who cannot count support it.
E.g. on Bitcoin level of scale, you have to download 52 GB of transactions vs 4 MB of headers. So Tangle scales 10000 times worse. If you go beyond Bitcoin scale, it would be million times worse.
IOTA people are scammers. They know it's not secure, so they have central validator, but they lie that it will be secure in future. They are just trying to buy enough time to dump this shitcoins on people who believe in sci-fi.

It actually does not have to be a bigger transactions. There are basically two ways to do it:
1. Complex script which allows two cases: "Require (signature of owner) OR (1 years from now AND (signature of heir))"
2. Normal single-sig script + pre-signed time-locked transaction.
In the second case, you can use normal wallet script/address, but a wallet would automatically sign transaction which can only be submitted N years from now (secured by nLockTime). This method has several advantages:
1. No footprint on blockchain.
2. You can configure how your money is distributed among multiple heirs.
But there's also a disadvantage: The pre-signed transaction need to be securely stored. In principle, it's not secret, so you can make multiple back ups. Perhaps just send to all heirs by email. 
You can make it even more complex: it's quite possible that some of heirs will forget their keys. So it can be done in following way:
1. N years from now each output can be spent by a specific heirs
2. N+1 years from now output can be spent by k heirs
So for example if you have wife and two kids, if wife loses her key next year kids can recover the money. This complex policy will have no footprint on blockchain until will is executed.

The difference is that on Ethereum, a smart contract _can_ be implemented completely as a program on chain -- so a programmer can just write it as one piece of code and call it a day.
On the other hand, Bitcoin smart contracts typically require wallet-side component. In theory, this is more efficient, as you need less code on-chain. But in practice, you see fewer Bitcoin smart contracts because their author would have to modify wallet code to make it work. (E.g. to implement Assurance Contract Mike Hearn had to implement a completely separate wallet, although on-chain representation of it is trivial.)
It would be cool if Bitcoin wallets had some kind of a plugin architecture which would allow devs to easily plug their logic into it. But it's not really the case...

I think the biggest issue is that big Bitcoin companies do not want to build infrastructure.
Payment channel technology was known for 5+ years, and Bitcoin payments sucked big way even without full blocks (it might take 50 minutes until first confirmation even with empty blocks), yet none of these companies offer payment channel-based solution.
And now we have SegWit active for 5 months, and yet Coinbase still doesn't use it. SegWit was finalized a year ago, so they had a plenty of time.

OK, perhaps, take some time to read a bit?


Like stablecoin?
OK, if you want to hold some digital gold which can fluctuate 20% a day, Bitcoin is perfect for you. But business cannot use Bitcoin without taking a huge risk.
As much as I love masturbating to my Bitcoin wallet's balance, it would be pretty nice to see cryptocurrencies being used for trade. Sounds pretty useful, no?
First stablecoin ideas were formulated in 2012-2013. They were very suspicious at first. You know, how can one make gold out of nothing?
But if you look closely, it's not really "out of nothing". There's a plenty of investors who are willing to take risk for a potential of reward, and you can forge virtual gold from it just like you can buy pizza for bitcoins.
Many models were developed since then, and some of them are tested. E.g. BitShares has USD, GOLD, SILVER and so on for about three years, and it works quite well. IIRC there was only one glitch over three years.
So it's quite evident that it's possible to make digital asset pegged to value of other asset (like USD, gold or wheat) which will be right 99% of time. Of course, glitches are theoretically possible, but 99% is good enough for businesses. They can buy insurance against glitches. 


Do more research. [Here's]( my paper, BTW. What's not decentralized about it?


The oracle itself can be decentralized and connected to market. There's a lot of room between getting one dude to decide all settlements and having a complex structure with thousands of participants, checks and balances.
In my prediction market designs, there are no oracles. Everyone is an oracle for himself, deciding which fork to follow, and reasonable people will converge to one fork which works the same as with perfectly working oracle. Neat, eh?


Sorry mate, but I can't think for you. You have to take at least one case and really try to understand how it works.
I've been thinking about local state vs global state for quite a while when I was working on colored coins. Colored coins, by definition, can only use local state, while metacoins (Mastercoin, Counterparty...) can use global state. As a lead developer of colored coins at that time, I really tried to understand how much you can push applications which only rely on local state.


Depends on application. For a stablecoin you might need to manage a tiny amount of state, but it needs to be done on chain.
You are approaching this from a wrong angle. You assume that Satoshi is a divine figure and his design is perfect for all our cryptocurrency needs, and whatever applications do not fit are bad, or should be solved using some complex add-on contraptions. This is a very anti-science approach.
You first need to find classes of applications which need a global state. If you can't think of any, well, there's no point in this discussion.
If you can think of such an application, you can start thinking what it needs. If it needs huge amount of state then yeah, maybe we need to find some way to move it off-chain.
But what if it requires, like, 60 bytes? What if state-managed overhead is just 10% of space and 1% of execution time?
Then it's just fucking stupid to make a complex contraption just to optimize this away (especially as this complex contraption is going to have its own large overhead). If 10% space is so critical for you then you should campaign against use of multi-signature, as that adds 100+% overhead.


Yeah, just fucking do that, mate, why don't you? We've been waiting for some advanced cases built on Bitcoin, where are they, exactly?
Meanwhile, BitShares have been working perfectly for 3+ years, and Maker was launched few days ago.
Are you sure you aren't just rationalizing Bitcoin's simplistic design?

Not the same thing. Gravity isn't a mathematical object, so you cannot "prove it". ECDSA is a mathematical object, so proof is possible.
Also, a new discovery of gravity properties won't suddenly send you levitating, but new discovery in elliptic curve properties can make your bitcoins gone.


Not if there's a mathematical trick to break it completely.


Wrong. Bitcoin is probably the biggest asset class which relies on elliptic curve cryptography. With a market cap about 200 billion, it's not just a tiny thing for nerds anymore. This is just 3x smaller than Russia's entire stock market cap. It's bigger than many country's money supply and GDP.
You might say that banks are a bigger target, but
 * they don't use elliptic curve cryptography
 * even if you hack into bank's systems, you won't get all money out of it
Bank transaction are reversible, so they will just revert and switch to other keys.
So hacking Bitcoin will be the biggest thing you can do if you hack elliptic curves.
Also note that ECC can be cracked using quantum computers, so it's not really a question of "if", it's a question of "when". There are 50 qubit quantum computers now, so it looks like there's no law of nature which forbids creation of bigger ones.
Another thing to note: NSA have deprecated use of elliptic curve cryptography:

Why? What are old states useful for?
Your node can recreate them if necessary, there's no point in keeping it on the disk.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:13:36


I don't remember Satoshi ever writing about it. 


Well, the value of running a node is that you can verify transactions with a high degree of certainty. This might be important for businesses such as merchants, exchanges, miners.


He wrote:  "Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes." I.e. miners will run the nodes.
Obviously, companies which do mining need to sell coins at some point, so they need users to be able to verify transactions. So it's in miners' interest to run a fleet of nodes.


It was the case in early days. Each miner was running Bitcoin reference software, and there were a lot of them. So this model kinda makes sense if you consider a p2p model.
Obviously, this makes no sense if mining is done by specialists.
So either Satoshi changed his mind (started thinking in p2p terms but finally got more into economics/game theory), or he was anticipating tighter cooperation between miners.


Well, zero-confirmation payments is also silly, if you think about it: game-theoretically miner would rather take a transaction with higher fee. Yet Satoshi mentioned zero-conf as a viable approach. It seems that he was willing to experiment with various ideas.
Later Mike Hearn outlined idea of "coinbase confiscation" which is basically a model of tighter cooperation between miners. The idea is that miners can enforce mempool rules by punishing those who violate them.
Maybe Satoshi had something like that in mind. Satoshi and Mike Hearn communicated a lot, so maybe Satoshi hinted that to Mike.
We don't have any direct evidence, but transaction replacement logic implies that Satoshi anticipated some mechanism to enforce mempool rules. His design is otherwise well-thought-out, so it's unlikely that Satoshi implement complex logic just being confused about its security aspects. Perhaps he thought that mempool consensus can be added later, but transaction features which make use of it should be added to the protocol right away to make sure that the protocol remains compatible. That's the most likely explanation IMHO.

Yet it somehow has 14 billion dollar market cap.
It looks like there's no shortage of gullible idiots.
Or, in more polite way, we are dealing with bounded rationality and asymmetric information.
The thing is, bad stuff happens to good companies too. Doesn't Tesla systematically underperform and delay products? Does this means Elon Musk's reputation is ruined?
The problem is that all humans make errors, and, on top of that, there's a factor of luck. So bad actors do not immediately stand out.


As I mentioned, it's kinda trivial to establish plausible deniability. All you need to do is to run a company in a riskier way. You can always say that you underestimated risks, or there's a new factor at play, bad luck, etc.

Which kinda makes sense: we know that real world is very different from game theory, so even very sophisticated theoretical model might not reflect real behavior. So it makes sense to get something kinda working and see how people use it in practice.
For example, Satoshi didn't predict mining pools. He didn't expect that miners would gladly trade profit points for predictability.
Another example is transaction replacement logic implemented by Satoshi: it's based on the assumption that almost all miners are honest and will run reference software. I don't think it's a reasonable assumption, but Satoshi wrote a lot of code around this model.
So what Satoshi thought about scaling is kinda irrelevant now.
Of course, he mentioned few things. First, he said that blocks can be really big. [See here](


would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. 
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.
He talks about 700 MB blocks here.  He said that normal users will use SPV and nodes will be run by specialists:




network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.
So it seems that Satoshi was a big blocker. But you need to understand the context of this correspondence: this exchange happened after he published Bitcoin paper, and was trying to convince cryptographers that his approach is viable. So he was not describing an optimal solution, he merely said that at least some solution is possible.
Later he added 1 MB block size limit as he was concerned about DoS.
Satoshi also developed transaction replacement logic which can be used as payment channel for frequent transactions.


Core have been working on optimizing Bitcoin node software so it can actually handle bigger transaction volumes.  
It seems they are optimistic about LN, but there's also work e.g. on transaction aggregation.
SegWit increased maximum block size to 4 MB (although only ~2 MB is useable). With aggregation we can use this space more efficiently.
It might take some time, but this caution might be warranted. If we open new DoS vectors it might irreparably damage Bitcoin.

Or maybe just "b".
Like "Price is 7000b". What else can it be?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:12:49
Stablecoins like Dai (MakerDAO).
Liquidity mechanisms like Bancor. (On-chain automatic market-maker).
"Decentralized prediction market without arbiters". That's a name of a paper I co-authored. In the paper we described prediction market as a Bitcoin extension.
But for a practical implemention it would be at least an order of magnitude cheaper to implement and deploy it on top of Ethereum.
You can find a concrete plan here: 
Using Ethereum programming stack, this would be like a one-week project. (I know because I did several similar but simpler projects.)
On Bitcoin, it might take a year to do something barely functional. Because first you discover that there are no wallets which can do what you need, so you make a new wallet. Then you need a new network protocol and a new p2p network.
And in the end you get a sidechain which doesn't have smooth integration with mainnet.
Note that none of things I mentioned have any relationship with cryptography.
But even for things which can in theory be done in top of Bitcoin, you have something like 100x difference in implementation complexity. That's the difference between "theoretical" and "practical".

Did you read the article I linked to? It's really short. Please read it. It's not some random drivel on forums, it's an actual explanation by an Ethereum dev.
I'll quote few paragraphs:






Which part of it is hard to understand? Ethereum pruning is not Bitcoin pruning. It's state-pruning as opposed to block-pruning. State is something which is computed from blocks.
Ethereum node with all Ethereum data which can compute everything it ever needs to needs only 25 GB on disk. 


Wow, do you just make shit up? Ethereum uses committed states. They cannot be faked, even if you own 99.99% of nodes. Hash won't match.


Are you a professional FUDder? Issue you linked to has nothing to do with what you said.
Don't fuck with me. I'm not an Ethereum dev, but I'm a blockchain dev. I know what are states and blocks. You can't fool me by making shit up and linking to unrelated issues.
I agree that Ethereum has an issue, but that doesn't mean it has a large blockchain. It's more like Ethereum nodes require more resources to verify stuff because Ethereum computation model is more complex.

It's not a "side chain", it's a metacoin. 
They can, in theory, move it to a sidechain, but since decentralized sidechains are currently impossible, Tether issuers might be liable for contents of transactions. I.e. it won't be a cryptocurrency anymore, but a shoddy anonymous payment network.
So it would be much better/easier to move it to a coin which supports tokens natively: Nxt, BitShares, Ethereum, Waves, NEM, ... Faster, cheaper, native DEX which doesn't suck.

Few more incredible things:
 * he implemented it all by himself
 * code had remarkably few bugs, although it used unsafe language (C++) and wasn't really top-quality in terms of prettiness
If Satoshi was slightly worse than he is a programmer, Bitcoin could be completely derailed in the first year. E.g. imagine there was arbitrary-code-execution from remote (which isn't at all uncommon for C++), suddenly whole Bitcoin network becomes infected, attacker controls all crypto keys. That would be the death of cryptocurrencies.

It's not a matter of "sticks", it's ongoing research, and it might take many decades until somebody finds a trick to crack it.
There were many cases where crypto schemes were assumed to be secure until they were broken.
Also it's possible that e.g. in 100 years mathematicians will prove that it's actually impossible to crack ECDSA.

Ripple is very different. From the start it owned all the coins, and led the consensus. I don't think it's correct any conclusions from Ripple to PoS system.


Well again, it is not like developers decide on each block or transaction. All they need is to include a hash of the block several weeks or months old. It's extremely non-contentious, and it's something they ALREADY do now.
The only difference is how this hash is used. It will not affect in any way affect people who _already_ run a node, it will only affect people who are new. And they can cross-check this hash from many sources:
 * block explorers
 * exchanges
 * on forums, twitter, IRC, etc.
 * in person
So this is a non-issue.
Figuring out some anchor block from which you can bootstrap is no harder than figuring out whether Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin, and where to download it from, is it?
(Note that Ouroboros Genesis claims it solved "weak subjectivity" issue, but I still haven't reviewed that, so I'm assuming "subjectivity" is necessary.)


No, it is actually important, since I'm not going to review all source code for every release. I gotta trust people who made Gitian builds.
People who actually do not rely on trust are like 0.001% of community. And for those people things won't change, since, again, it makes no difference for nodes which are already running.
Then again, for Bitcoin a better solution would be PoW+PoS hybrid which doesn't really have subjectivity problem...


LOL yeah a whopping 0.00001% of the user base is SAFE NOW, assuming you can trust the satellite feed.

No. Basically, computer memory is usually aligned with power-of-two, and so it was useful to redefine "kilo-" as 1024. So Commodore 64 was 65536 bytes.
However, when we talk about telecom stuff, like bits per second, bytes per second, amount of data per second and so on, there's no need to align anything, so "kilo-" is 1000.
Standard bodies found that it's confusing as fuck, so they invented [binary prefixes]( Now:
 * kilobyte, or KB is 1000 bytes
 * kibibyte, or KiB is 1024 bytes
Binary prefixes are used mostly when talking about size of memory or some kind of buffer aligned with memory page size.
Since transaction and block sizes are not aligned with memory pages, but are just amount of data, they are based on normal prefixes. 
So 1 MB block size limit is actually 1000000 bytes. Currently it exists as [MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT]( which is 4000000.
And "fee per kilobyte" actually means fee per 1000 bytes, [see here](

So some damage is definitely on them.
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:39:28
I told you which it is, I actually checked this in code.
As a rule of thumb, binary prefixes usually apply to
 
 * memory sizes
 * something which is aligned with memory pages
For the rest of stuff, e.g. size of data, data transferred per unit of time, megabits/second, kilobytes/second, we use normal SI prefixes.
The only area where this is still confusing is storage. OS people generally believe that since storage size is aligned with sector size, which is power-of-two, it should be reported using binary units. But companies who make storage believe that size of the disk has nothing to do with power-of-two, so they report decimal units.

Ability to close channel in time depends not only on your wallet, but also on blockchain capacity. If your transaction isn't confirmed on time, counterparty has a chance to steal money.

It doesn't make sense to consider a scenario where Bob can win only a fraction of funds. If you are considering a Bob's attack, you need to consider a state which is favorable to Bob.
1. Initial: 0.5 BTC Alice, 0.5 Bob
2. Alice paid 0.4 BTC to Bob: 0.1 BTC Alice, 0.9 BTC Bob.
3. Bob paid 0.8 BTC to Alice: 0.9 BTC Alice, 0.1 BTC Bob.
So suppose Bob broadcasts transaction 
If Alice wants to recover all the funds which belong to her, she can only spend 0.1 BTC on fees, but Bob can spend up to 0.9 BTC.
Or are you saying that LN wallets will only allow moving 10% of funds which were put into a channel?

It's too early to make any conclusions. While we need off-chain scaling solutions, we also need on-chain capacity.

So it makes sense to have as much on-chain capacity as possible even if you're betting on Lightning.

I'm not IOTA/Hashgraph expert (in fact I think those projects are garbage), but I'm somewhat of a consensus system expert, having published academic papers about PoW and PoS.


This doesn't matter, as attacker can simply rent hashrate, e.g. on NiceHash. In the end it's all money.
1. Attacker can borrow money in the bank and buy mining rigs and electricity. Pay off the loan once attack succeeds.
2. He can rent mining rigs.
3. He can hijack big mining pools &amp; operations.
4. He can rent the hashrate. 
Note that a hilarious thing is that renting hashpower enough to mine 1000 BTC worth of blocks will cost you about 1000 BTC under equilibrium conditions. So successful attack might be essentially free.


Does not follow.


They do not require _software_, they require cryptocurrency. You cannot just dream up yourself bitcoins and buy something. It doesn't work like that.
There's a simulation argument, but it requires hunting for old keys, so not easy to pull off. Not to mention that PoS coins will include provisions against simulation.


It is in fact easier to dream up energy since energy providers will ship it to you before you pay. You pay only after a successful attack.
You can't do that to attack PoS, as people can easily check if you _currently_ own coins, software will reject your dreamt-up coins.
So by your own reasoning, PoS is much more secure.

Utter bullshit, it's the opposite.
You CANNOT get rid of BitMain if Bitmain wants to kill Bitcoin, for example:
1. They can do 51% mining at loss. Other rational miners will sell their equipment at a low price, so realistically they will have NO competition whatsoever.
2. If you change PoW they can make mining equipment for that new PoW, since they already have the capital, competent designers, contracts, etc.
3. So if one company can obtain 51% of hardware, it can totally just destroy Bitcoin if they want to.
Same thing if e.g. Bitmain wants to implement censorship -- no way other miners can do anything, and if you change PoW Bitmain will be first to implement censorship on your new chain.
On the other hand, PoS stakeholders are dethronable -- the community can simply fork to exclude them. In fact it might be just a soft fork, so pretty easy to organize.
So if PoS stakeholders want to implement censorship, just fork them off.
Also they have a lot more to lose than PoW miners.
So PoW is superior to PoS only if:
1. You ignore actual, real threats affecting PoW
2. You make up some bullshit imaginary threats affecting PoS
In other words, intellectual dishonesty.

It's still an unsolved problem.

Well, obviously, if one has reasons to spend bitcoins, he shouldn't ask anybody. It's his choice.
The question here is when one should sell his bitcoins to get out, i.e. to convert bitcoins to fiat money, to take profit/loss. And "never" is a very sensible answer.
First, if you believe that Bitcoin is a superior form of currency/store of value, then why sell it for inflatable fiat money? [This makes no sense.](
If you believe that fiat is better than Bitcoin, why did you buy?
Second, many people believe that they can time the market. Which is dumb.
Third, people believed they are smart to take profit when Bitcoin hit $1, $10, $100, $1000. They might have had nice 10x or 100x return, but they still missed a lot. So the point here, historically, getting out of Bitcoin was financially a dumb decision.
So, yeah, you need to apply some thought when interpreting these questions. The point isn't to forbid selling bitcoins, obviously. But if one is just wondering if he should sell bitcoins to take profit... "Never" is a sound advice. At least, historically.

I believe he's not Hal Finney. There might be many superficial coincidences.
But if you look at Hal Finney's RPOW code, it is in UNIX style. Clean, modularized C, designed to work on multiple platforms.
On the other hand, Satoshi used rather messy C++, designed to work on Windows only, without any modularization.
I really don't think it's possible that Hal got rid of the best practices he learned over decades and deliberately made his most important work non-portable and lacking API.
So no, Satoshi is not Hal Finney. We can rule it out with a great degree of certainty.
There are other reasons too:
1. Hal was among few people who talked with Satoshi on crypto mailing list after publication of the paper, and is the first serious Bitcoin supporter. If you believe that Satoshi is Hal's sock puppet, doesn't this paint Hal in a bad light?
2. Also assuming Hal wanted to hide his identity, wouldn't it be stupid to vocally support your own sock puppet on forum?
3. Sending transaction to yourself, that's also quite a stupid milestone.


Well again, if Finney understood that being a cryptocurrrency founder is dangerous, why would he put Dorian into a danger by using his name as a pseudonym?
It would make much more sense to use a fictional name.

Many cryptographic constructs &amp; protocol failed after 10-20 years. So the fact that it worked for 10 years doesn't say much about the future.


Not quite, more importantly, PoS attempts to decentralize it much more evenly. Currently 4 big pools have &gt;50% of Bitcoin's hashpower. So number of important block-producers is low. PoS attempts to scale to hundreds or thousands of active block producers.
PoS is not so much an answer to energy efficiency, but to lack of decentralization in PoW.

No, they aren't. They are unconfirmed transactions.
The difference between Lightning transactions and normal unconfirmed transaction is that Lightning transactions happen within a contract which makes it impossible for one of parties to cancel or double-spend them.
Accepting unconfirmed transaction is risky because network knows nothing about your arrangement with sender, and he can cancel payment through double-spending at any time.
But when you do Lightning, you first get the contract confirmed on-chain. Now the blockchain knows what you and your counterparty agreed to, and it won't allow your counterparty to cheat.
So this has nothing to do with IOU, LN transactions are simply transactions with delayed confirmation and updateability.
IOUs depend on trust, LN transactions do not. IOUs aren't guaranteed to be repaid, LN transactions are certain.

LTC -- yes. Dash, XMR -- maybe.
ETH -- no. I'm not an Ethereum hater, I own quite a few, but there are many reasons it won't work well:
1. Ethereum network is already almost clogged. A slight increase of a load will make it as bad as Bitcoin.
2. There are no good, mature Ethereum wallets.
3. Ethereum wallets do not provide privacy, even basic Bitcoin privacy. They encourage address reuse, so it's trivial to list one's transactions.
4. Ethereum itself is complex and hard forks quite often, so technical issues are much more likely than with LTC, for example.
So LTC would be a better target now.

You can write non-GUI applications in pure C using only standard C functions. The only difference is slashes.
Hal Finney's RPOW has builds for Windows, there are WIN32 mentions in code:
So I think there are very little reasons for him to abandon C. While it's easier to work with GUI toolkits from C++, I'm sure Hal was aware of the concept of linking. You can link a C library into a C++ project.
As you can see RPOW code is neatly organized into `common`, `server` and `client`. I really don't think Hal would forget about modularization just because Windows.

I think 8 years should be enough to formulate a realistic scaling plan. If you aren't able to provide a plan, then why should people have faith in you?
It seems like people assume that LN will solve scaling, but there are NO realistic simulations. (Note that making a simulation is easy when you have an idea how it's going to work.) I've spoken with many LN devs, and they are more cautious about this, saying that LN is going to be useful only for small payments.
I'll remind you that in 2014 we've been told that sidechains are going to improve everything, kill all alt-coins, etc. And where are they, exactly?

ECDSA security depends on a fact that there's no efficient algorithm for a discrete logarithm problem, i.e. finding `x` such that `g^x = Y` (where g is a generator of a curve and x is an integer).
We do not know such an algorithm, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It haven't been proven that it doesn't exist. This isn't a NP-complete problem.
We know that quantum computers can speed up solution to this problem, so at a point where ECDSA is broken, SHA256 will still remain secure.
Intuitively, SHA256 consists of many rounds of confusion and diffusion, so it's very unlikely there's some clever mathematical surprise. But elliptic curve is a mathematical object and there might be some yet-unknown property which would make solving dlp triivial.

Suppose some other client, for example, BitcoinJ has a bug which makes it reject blocks which Bitcoin Core considers valid. One day somebody mines a block which triggers a corner case and BitcoinJ is forked off. BitcoinJ users will need to upgrade to continue using it.

Well, by this logic, blockchain shouldn't be used for _anything_.
If you believe that Bitcoin is useful, then it follows that stable coins (pegged tokens) are also useful, as they have same properties but are more useful for business transactions. You can use payment channels with these pegged tokens, they aren't different from base cryptocurrency in any way, but it's critical that reserves are kept on blockchain and are usable in case of emergency.
As for prediction markets, as long as blockchains are useful for payments, they can accommodate prediction markets as well, since there isn't much overhead and it's essentially just payments with some extra stuff.


They are impossible in Bitcoin.
You might be able to do some analog which is for the same use, but has different properties, e.g. relies on trust to a much larger degree.
For prediction market I was studying possibility of implementing it within colored coin model, but it's not "in Bitcoin", as it cannot use Bitcoin as a currency. So, basically, Bitcoin let's you to implement some crappy emulation in an extremely hard way. Nice, isn't it?

The above scenario is too hypothetical to be useful.
One of actual business cases for "blockchain" was described in Haber &amp; Stornetta paper which served as an inspiration for Bitcoin design:


document has been tampered with? These documents can benet from time-stamping, too, under
the following circumstances. Suppose one can establish that either the necessary knowledge or the
motivation to tamper with a document did not exist until long after the document's creation. For
example, one can imagine a company that deals with large numbers of documents each day, some
few of which are later found to be incriminating. If all the company's documents were routinely
time-stamped at the time of their creation, then by the time it became apparent which documents were incriminating and how they needed to be modied, it would be too late to tamper with them.
We will call such documents tamper-unpredictable. It seems clear that many business documents are
tamper-unpredictable. Thus, if time-stamping were to be incorporated into the established order of
business, the credibility of many documents could be enhanced.
Hope it's sufficiently clear.
The difference between linked timestamping proposed by H&amp;S and what people call blockchain in enterprise contexts is that blockchain also provides replicated storage for the data/documents themselves. 
The problem with timestamping is that incriminating document can be destroyed. Like, "sorry, dog ate my document".

I'm afraid that LN will work fine _in theory_, but will be super-inconvenient in practice, and thus not actually usable.

The problem with it is that it creates an incentive to create fake information (aka hype, pump &amp; dump) to profit.
Friedman thinks in a very abstract way, but in reality a company isn't an abstract entity, it is run by real people who have their own priorities.
Currently company's executives do not care that much about short-term stock performance (although many people claim it's already a huge problem).
But if you allow insider trading, executives can profit from volatility much more than they get from normal compensation. So if we assume they are rational, they won't give a flying fuck about actual business, it will be all about pump &amp; dump.
1. Buy shares.
2. Announce some amazing new project/partnership/etc.
3. Price goes up.
4. Dump shares.
5. Announce some sort of failure/delay/etc.
So, basically, executives will be encouraged to run company in the most unstable, reckless way possible.
They will profit from mis-estimation. It doesn't even need to be anything illegal: Just appoint the most optimistic person to lead the project, then when it predictably gets delayed blame it on him.

It might be less private as an unintended consequence of big blocks. With big blocks system can become federated rather than decentralized, and federated system can be easily regulated.
You might not see a connection, but many people do. Peter Todd made an explainer video about this back in 2013: 
Are you aware of the fact that Bitcoin can switch from decentralized to federated model via a soft-fork, and then to break a federation you need cooperation between 50+%?
Also Mike Hearn believes that miners should be benevolent rather than rational, and it makes sense for them to cooperate to enable features like zero-conf payments. So he doesn't seem to mind federated model.

A blockchain can be used to make sure that tag provider (Chronicled in this case) isn't defrauding customers. In theory, it could profit by selling duplicate tags to counterfeit product makers.
This kind of fraud can be detected if we allow customers to post digitally signed messages which assert that they currently own the product. But this will work only if posts are globally visible by all users. That's what a blockchain is for. (As Peter Todd [wrote]( proof-of-publication is the most important function of a blockchain.)


Article doesn't say that they use their own blockchain.
Counterparty or colored coins won't work because you want an owner of the physical tag to be able to reassign ownership at any time. This is a custom thing and it makes sense to develop a custom blockchain for that.

I don't think you understand how segregated witness works. The only essential difference is that txid doesn't depend on the signature.
Signatures will still be in the blockchain, but there will be an option to download transaction graph without signatures.
Right now you can download block headers only without transaction data. Of course, it's a bad thing: this way you won't validate blocks. But it's a good thing for mobile wallets which simply can't afford downloading and validating the whole blockchain.
Segregated witness gives us an option to download only transaction graph without signatures. Is it a bad thing? Yes, it's less secure. But it's much better than downloading only headers.


Segregated witness is primarily a solution to malleability problem, but it will also increase the available block space as a side effect. Hitting two birds with one stone is a good thing, no?

@_date: 2015-12-30 11:30:35
The issue which no-one is discussing is that eventually thin clients will have to rely on block explorer-like indexing nodes. E.g. electrum-server, bitcore, etc. They absolutely need to keep the whole blockchain to be useful, and indices require more storage than regular Bitcoin full node.
Right now SPV clients can connect directly to Bitcoin nodes and request transaction data using bloom filters. I don't think that's sustainable, though, as these requests are very expensive to process and are impossible to index. So we might end up with 1000 nodes serving 10000000 clients, who run these expensive queries... This won't work.
So while electrum-server is bad for privacy, it's the only computationally-feasible solution.
So back to indexing nodes, it's already quite expensive to run that, you can't do that on a $5/mo VPS as you need more storage. If we get to 8 MB blocks many hobbyists will stop running them as it will get too expensive.
So we might end with handful of commercial companies (like Blockchain.info) providing blockchain indexing service to millions of users. Which is very bad.
This can be addressed on a protocol level: we need committed, indexed UTXO set, which can be stored in a DHT, then we'll have 100% distributed solution. But it's a complex thing to develop, so I don't think it will happen anytime soon.

Currently fees are 1-2.5% of subsidy, even with full blocks. Block reward is directly linked to blockchain security.
Gavin Andresen wrote some time ago that he doesn't know what will secure network in future. There are some proposals involving assurance contracts, but it's not clear whether they are economically viable.
If we care about long-term success of Bitcoin, we need a plausible security model, and we need it right now. Sure, it's possible that we invent something better in future, but we can't just say "we'll figure that out in future", as then people will think that Bitcoin might fail in future.
Transaction fee used to secure the network is the most plausible model and one which is easily understandable and makes sense. User pays a fee because he wants his transaction to be confirmed, and those fees pay for network security.
Fees are only 1-2.5% of the reward subsidy now, that's basically insignificant. But after reward halving it will be 2-5%. Now this is something which can actually motivate miners, so at that point we'll have evidence that fees might cover Bitcoin security costs in future.
Note that right now block size increase won't increase miners' revenue, as there aren't enough high-fee transaction to get to 0.5 BTC reward in each block. But in future if transaction volume increases bigger blocks will also increase total amount of fees miners collect, thus we'll be on a path to fees gradually replacing the subsidy.
There are people who say that we should get fees close to 0 to attract as many users and possible. And later, say, 20 years from now, we'll enable fees and then it will be enough to cover security costs. Well, I don't think it works that way, if fees are essentially zero people will send transactions just for shits and giggles, business will build their models around that (like Satoshi Dice did in 2012), etc. Then when you actually enable fees, these users will move to some alt-coin which has 0 fees and subsidizes security via reward subsidy, or will just stop doing transactions for shits and giggles. So you'll find that the actual transaction volume is nowhere as big as you thought it is.
It's better to avoid short-term focus and price shocks. We already had 6 years to play with zero fee transaction ideas and whatnot, now let's try to make a more realistic, market-based system.

It can work if the tag itself will own the token. if you want the actual owner information to be committed to the blockchain you need an additional protocol on top of that.
There are other considerations. Making Bitcoin transaction costs money. Capacity is limited, if you're putting tags on a fuckton of products it might be a problem.
Colored coins can be a good choice if quantity of goods is limited and good are expensive enough so that $0.05-0.10 spent on issuance and transfers won't matter.

1. Not everybody agrees with Peter R.

Normally miners are rational, but there might be somebody trying to manipulate or destroy the system. Bitcoin works as long as _the majority_ of miners is honest and/or rational. It needs to be able to defend from weird behavior originating from the minority.

No, it's more like nitpicking: it's totally fine downloads implementation from bitcoin.org, but got forbid that hash of a month-old block, which we include anyway, is used for consensus -- that's bloody murder!
Or even more precisely: In case of an attack which is highly theoretical in nature, a cryptocurrency implementation can rely on a safeguard mechanism added by developers. OMG ITS SO CENTRALIZED, COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin node bootstrapping is vulnerable to practical network-level attacks which costs less than $100k to mount, and nobody gives a flying fuck.

The Bitcoin protocol has a block size limit which doesn't allow the network to confirm more than ~500000 transactions per day, effectively limiting network's capacity to process payments.
Previously this limit wasn't an issue, but in 2015 we started hitting it. Some payments are delayed, which, of course, pisses people off. People have to pay higher fees to increase priority of their payments.
So now there is a debate: Should we increase the limit, remove it altogether, or keep it as is?
Pretty much everyone agrees that the limit should be increased in future, but there is a disagreement on when and how do it.
Some people say that the limit is there for a good reason, and we should be careful with it, increasing it only a little.
Other people say that it's really a pressing issue, as limited capacity affects users, and we should increase the limit ASAP.
"Segregated Witness" which is mentioned in the title is an optimization trick which will make transactions 2-4 times smaller, thus it is essentially equivalent to increasing the limit 2-4x once the change is adopted. Core developers argue that it's safer way of increasing the limit and it has several other benefits, so it should be implemented ASAP.
The guy who's twitter is linked is a well-known public speaker who has in-depth understanding of the Bitcoin protocol (he in fact wrote a book about it), and he's now arguing in favor of actually increasing the limit rather than using various optimization tricks.

More bits? I really doubt it. On the public internet you need to conserve bandwidth since capacity is limited and latency can be high.
But for intranets there are no such limitations, so you can easily move terabytes on a daily basis. And people actually do that, for example, with MapReduce you stream your entire dataset over the network to process it, and it's not a problem because you have a fast, dedicated network for that.
Or with thin clients might be equivalent to streaming video whole day long, but nobody cares because there is a dedicated connection.
The value of communication on the internet might be higher because you can move information between different parties so it's likely some new information, but I think intranets can easily compete in terms of bits being moved.

You people seriously overestimate how hard it is to implement a distributed ledger. It's on scale of a dozen man-months for good developers, assuming that low-level crypto libraries are already implemented (e.g. Satoshi used OpenSSL). 
We know that because there is a number of full-node or nearly full-node implementations: BitcoinJ, bitcoinjs, Haskcoin, btcd and so on. It doesn't take an extraordinary effort to re-implement Bitcoin, it's quite feasible for small groups of developers to do it.

Sipa posted that in February 2013. Back then mining was done mostly by hobbyists and enthusiasts, who were either mining as individuals or running a small business. 
Large mining operations appeared later. Obviously, they (especially mining equipment manufacturers who are mining themselves) have much more power than individuals.
So they can try various optimizations which boost their profits even if they potentially hurt Bitcoins security. E.g. SPV mining, it's already observed in practice.
Moreover, if a group of miners can somehow steal profits of other group of miners, they can definitely try that. And as the selfish miner paper, as well as Peter Todd's calculations demonstrate, it's theoretically possible in certain circumstances.
And thus we should be very cautious. If big blocks can be used to manipulate the network it's certainly a possibility which should be considered.
The landscape have drastically changed since 2013. Could the current situation be predicted? Yes, maybe. But it wasn't obvious that the centralization of mining will be a major unsolved issue. Back in 2013 we thought we need to decentralize pools, but now mining is physically concentrated.

You've got me wrong, I'm not a fan of Lightning Network. I just don't think that we should pretend that Bitcoin is appropriate for point-of-sale use.


What you call "core features" are actually implementation byproducts which allow you to pretend that Bitcoin is appropriate for PoS use. It sort of works, but it is based on a _very_ shaky basis.
Do you understand why we need proof-of-work?
Why do you assume that Bitcoin transactions can be confirmed without proof-of-work?
I don't think that core devs go "all in" on LN, they just have a pragmatic vision of letting Bitcoin to be what it actually is: inefficient, slow, but super-decentralized.
For example, Peter Todd who's pushing RBF and thus "is killing zero conf" isn't a LN fan.
"Big blocks or LN" is a false dichotomy.
I'd fucking love Bitcoin to become the world currency (as all my savings are in Bitcoin now, seriously), but I understand that it's just not ready for it yet. It's not OK to pretend that problems do not exist, it's not OK to remove safety mechanisms.

I agree with Pieter Wuille when he says that Bitcoin is interesting only as long as it is decentralized, censorship-resistant, etc. It's not a problem to build a federated system which would scale more easily but it won't have same properties.

I think it would be better if people get a realistic idea about how Bitcoin works sooner rather than later. For years pumpers advertised Bitcoin as a system with free, instant transactions. People get really confused when they see that transfer has a fee and confirmations might take hours.
"Free, instant transactions" sounds good, but we can't get more people to use Bitcoin by lying to them.
I think people need to understand that Bitcoin really shines not because it's cheaper than PayPal, but because it can work where other payment systems don't due to capital controls, for example. (For example, you can't receive money via PayPal in Ukraine due to the red tape.)
Also it's quite obvious that Bitcoin isn't really suitable for microtransactions (unless you build something on top of Bitcoin, _that_ is possible).
So anyway, it's the 6th year since Bitcoin launch, I think it's about time to find it's niche, features, etc.
I mean it will be ridiculous to wait till 60th birthday to learn about true features, no?
Certainly it can be said that Bitcoin can grow more if we keep using subsidy for security and increase block size to make transactions cheaper. But it will be fake growth if it doesn't fit the limitations of the technology.
People who came to Bitcoin for "free transactions" will flock to a different system when they'll discover that it's cheaper.

It's much better than just increasing to 2 MB because it solves the malleability issue.
It is a serious issue. Like, really serious. Suppose you do one payment, and then a minute later do another. Second payment might fail if the first tx is malleated. 
So you have to re-do it. But, as far as I know, none of the wallets existing today will re-do the transaction automatically, they won't even warn you about it.
If the software which merchant uses doesn't handle malleability well it might send you goods without actually receiving a payment. If it handles it well, you will be surprised that invoice is unpaid even though you clearly paid it off.

Nobody is a "king of Bitcoin". Fees are a natural consequence of Bitcoin design.
Everything has a price. Even if the product or service is digital or virtual, it still has a price. Storing data has a price. Sending data has a price. Security has a price, etc.
As Peter R have described, we're going to have a fee market even if we remove hard block limit.


Perhaps you don't understand how it works, but nobody is introducing it, it just happens. Miners sort transactions by fee per KB, it was like that for years. And for years people knew they can increase a fee to make sure their transaction gets confirmed ASAP. So don't pretend it's something new which got introduced recently. It's just getting more relevant now, but you can't blame people for this, that's ridiculous.

Actually I'm running a blockchain indexer as well, but it's a custom one we've built, also using node.js. Load average on the system with indexer is 0.30 (which includes bitcoind, several node processes and postgres).

What are you talking about? I didn't mention centralization. And it's not about big blocks/small costs.
Bitcoin has a reputation of being completely unbreakable, but it works that way only as long as there is an unbreakable consensus about the protocol. If a conflict among developers will create an uncertainty about the protocol, Bitcoin will become worthless as people will no longer trust it.

This wallet is based on one of the most popular Bitcoin libraries, people working on it are very competent. I'm sure they will take the issue seriously.
(I think the issue is that minrelaytxfee was updated in October or November, and thus dust threshold went from about 560 satoshi to 2730, So it might be that they haven't updated the wallet yet. I can't believe they just forgot dust check.)

I think the concept of "priority transactions" is confusing and it would be good to get rid of it.
The main argument against it is that we want miners to be rational, in that case their behavior can be reasoned about. There is a simple and straightforward model: transactions pay fees, miners are interested to collect fees, so they include transactions which pay highest fees. This is a plausible model for Bitcoin mining (and, thus, security) in future.
Existence of these "priority transactions" implies that we expect miners to be benevolent and go against their immediate interest, so this opens a can of works: what if miners cease to benevolent, will Bitcoin still work? What kind of altruism do we expect? And why? That is, it's much easier to question soundness of Bitcoin protocol if we assume that "priority transactions" are part of it.
Another problem is that it's confusing and unpredictable. Right now (before this change) if you send a transaction without a fee you don't know when it will be confirmed or whether it will be ever confirmed at all. Many miners already set "free transaction space" to zero. Really, go to blockchain.info and open any block. Do you see any zero-fee transactions (aside from coinbase)? (They are typically in the beginning of the block if they exist.)
So it is an issue, because people still think they can send these free transactions. Then their transactions get stuck, and it can be a major problem in many cases. Or people might wonder why their wallet adds a fee if they heard that "Bitcoin transactions are free", so they might think that wallet is broken or tries to scam them.

The bigger question is why you trusted Mike Hearn before he joined R3.
He's the guy who claims that miners need to cooperate for Bitcoin to succeed, he claims it's not enough for miners to be rational, thus kind of dismisses the whole idea of Bitcoin that we don't have to trust miners.
He's the guy who seriously researched black lists/red lists, that is, censorship. Again, this goes against the core ideas of Bitcoin.
Finally, in his fork he banned Tor relays because he's concerned about DoS or something. Well somehow normal node software doesn't have a problem with it.
I think it's fairly clear that he wants to evolve Bitcoin into something very different, he wants Bitcoin to be regulator-friendly and governed by a consortium of miners.
But I don't think Mike has any secret agenda, previously he was open about his visions.

I'm running bitcoind on several different servers, some of them are reachable via a public IP, other aren't.
With public IP:
 * version v0.11.0, minrelaytxfee=0.00004
 * CPU fluctuates between 20% and 50%
 * 113 connections
 * 37135 transactions in mempool, 463 MB total
 * I see a lot of ERROR messages in debug.log
    2015-12-21 13:51:16 ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: free transaction rejected by rate limiter
    2015-12-21 13:51:16 ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: nonstandard transaction: dust
Without public IP:
 * version v0.11.1, no config tweaks
 * CPU usage often stays in 0-2% range, 
 * 9 connections
 *   35766 transactions in mempool,  428 MB
 * very few ERROR messages in debug.log
So it looks like CPU usage correlates with the number of connections. I'm not sure if there is any specific cause (possible causes: old/misconfigured nodes pushing dust &amp; spam transactions; thin clients catching up with the blockchain using bloom queries), or just the sheer number of connections.
You can restrict the number of connection with maxconnections config parameter.
BTW both of my bitcoind:s use more than 2 GB RAM. So I'm not sure it's feasible to run a full node on a cheap VPS. Mempool used to be only ~1-2 MB, but it grew due to stress test and blocks getting full. So it requires more RAM now.

Bitcoin is most useful as a store of value.
It's not really designed for consumer payments.
The interesting thing about Bitcoin is censorship-resistance and its macroeconomic properties (fixed supply cap). This makes Bitcoin ideal as a government-independent asset.
This might be not relevant to you personally, but if you look throughout the history, it's not uncommon for people to suffer for their asset and property confiscation. 
Bitcoin can be completely detached from physical or government control. There's a lot of demand for that kind of stuff.

There's an upper limit, of course, but it's pretty high.
In theory, a "flippening" against gold is possible, i.e. Bitcoin "market cap" will exceed "market cap" of gold (i.e. total value of all gold used for savings purposes). This can happen if gold's scarcity becomes disputed, e.g. when asteroid mining becomes a reality.
Bitcoin might be even better than gold as it has better properties -- doesn't have significant storage costs, can be easily validated, is much more liquid, can be used for payments and so on.
So a market cap reaching hundreds of trillions of today-dollars isn't out of question.

Current scaling proposals are just stopgap measures. As such, they aren't wrong.
I think it's obvious that over time we'll get better and better proposals on scaling Bitcoin while keeping it decentralized. For example, [Bitcoin-NG design]( was published only months ago and it is really promising.
But the problem is that it will take years to do research and implement things (and more sophisticated and promising proposals are usually also more complex). So we need some stopgap solution right now.
That's what debate is about. There are essentially two camps: "Sky is falling! We need bigger blocks NOW!" and "It can wait. OK, well, if it bothers you so much, we can tweak some thing to alleviate the problem".

"Nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded!"
It's far more likely that people who are most sensitive to fees will switch to alt-coins. There's nearly infinite supply of block space, but the less you can afford to pay in fees, the more you can lose due to lack of security or volatility.
So the problem might correct itself naturally: users switching to alt-coins will free up Bitcoin block space for those who want to pay bigger fees for the best security.
"One size fits all" rarely works, you can't optimize for everything at once. So different alt-coins filling different niches is very natural.

I don't think so. Banks are neither capable nor interested in making a currency like Bitcoin which can be used by anyone, isn't bound by regulations and cannot be inflated by the issuer.
However, you need to be aware of Bitcoin's unique selling points. Ability to make transactions quick is not really unique, there is a plenty of systems which offer instantaneous transfers.
But if you want a store of value not tied to fiat currencies Bitcoin is pretty much unbeatble.

Well, asteroid mining is borderline viable with the current technology.
There's already a bunch of commercial projects exploring this: 
And NASA is already running a sample-return mission: 
To make asteroid mining viable you basically need reusable modules and refueling station in space. Since people already managed to build a station in space, it's not so much a fundamental problem as just a matter of getting enough investment for R&amp;D and executing it at scale.
On the other hand, creating gold in a lab is already done, but unlikely to ever be viable, as it produces tiny amounts of gold using large amounts of energy. Perhaps a better way to produce gold would be to filter sea water (which has gold diluted in it), but that requires huge amounts of energy.

Not if (1) bidding is done via Bitcoin transaction which are visible on the blockchain, (2) there is a hard cut-off after some point.
Well, at least manipulation will be quite hard and expensive.
The conditions of the auction should include a clause like this: "Bidding closes 100 blocks after 50th bid is received".
Then the best way to win is to send your bid right after 99th block is mined. Bids sent within 100th block can be randomized using block hash.
Thus to manipulate the auction owner can send many bids to be included in 100th block. Even if these bids are free for him (he pays to himself), but he still pays transaction fees, so his capacity to manipulate is limited.
I'm not sure it's the best arrangement, but I think there's a way to make it both fun and fair.

Why? A lot of CPUs are owned by botnets. A lot of CPUs are available for rent from AWS, Azure, GCloud etc.
This is very bad for blockchain security. If attacker can rent 51% of total hashpower, he can perform attack with no cost -- as he can pay the rent using proceedings of an attack, and attack is successful with 100% probability.
Is this what you want?
Mining centralization has some value: specialized miners have a vested interest in long-term success. With "once CPU one vote" you don't have that.

OP_RETURN is just a way to publish data. What matters is how you publish it and what you do with it afterwards.
You can't say that all protocol used on the Internet are the same because they all use IP. HTTP, Bitcoin and BitTorrent are drastically different, but they all use TCP/IP.
If you want a protocol with a custom feature (ownership can be reassigned), you need a custom protocol. It can be built on top of OP_RETURN data publishing mechanism just like you can build a custom protocol on top of TCP/IP.

No. The way I see it, "blockchain" became an umbrella term for any kind of a technology which is based on deterministic execution and strong cryptography. And since everybody is interested in better security, better interoperation and fewer bugs, they are interested in implementing new features (or reimplementing old ones) on top of this new approach.
The alternative is the old approach, like databases, APIs, etc. But nobody talks about this technology because it's well-known and not news-worthy.
As for why they are interested, banks fear that they will be disrupted by tech companies. (Cf. Uber.) And the blockchain is just the latest trend, so they give it a special attention. Business people are trying to anticipate future threats, thus pay a lot of attention to trends. You know, reacting to yesterday's threats is not a wise choice.


So true. 
Well, it's not hard to imagine that it would be great if all banks shared some common system which would allow all transfers to be instantaneous and low-cost, and allowed all kinds of advanced features. Like, say, escrow. If you're buying something big, you want to use escrow. Something so simple becomes a problem with current banking systems, but tech-wise it should be trivial.
So this bigger goal is well-understood, but it's obvious it will take a lot of time to develop it and deploy it in practice.
So they're scrambling to find some smaller things which can be implemented and deployed right now, and which will put them on track to that worldwide, unified, all-capable system. It might be challenging to integrate new blockchain stuff with existing systems, to satisfy regulatory requirements, etc.

If US government establishes a Bitcoin black list, it will force all US-based startups to comply with it, otherwise, what's the purpose of that black list? Thus companies like Coinbase, BitPay will use it.
Now if payment processors use black lists, ordinary users will be compelled to use wallets with black lists as well: otherwise there's a chance they'll get coins which they won't be able to spend via merchants who use Coinbase or BitPay to accept payments.
Exchanges outside of US can be forced to comply if they work with US dollars: US banks will block them if they don't _voluntarily_ accept black listing. Even if they use non-US banks, those banks need to work with US banks to process USD payments, and thus US government has control over them.
So users outside of US will also be encouraged to use wallets with blacklists.

I'm not sure we can avoid fee market now. Many miners deliberately build blocks smaller than the hard limit even when there's a plenty of transactions in mempool.
But suppose there is a way to prevent it. Would that be a right choice?
If fees are kept artificially low, eventually they'll rise to market level, and that would be a shock for economic players. Bigger economy = more pain.
I think that's a good argument to not kick the can down the road.
How would you prevent fee market from forming? It's possible to make a soft-fork which will establish fixed fee rate. But that's too inflexible and people will complain they can't prioritize their transactions, and it's too easy to spam.

Bitcoin addresses use 160-bit hashing, and thus we have 80-bit security against quantum attack. This is probably too low to say that it will never be cracked, but it's not an easy target either. In theory at least, RSA and ECDSA are much more vulnerable to quantum attacks.

Spot on. Coin-days are already used for Sybil attack prevention of sorts in several applications, notable Bitcoin free transactions throttling and Peercoin proof-of-stake (the initial protocol version was 100% based on coin-days, later version use it in a more limited form).
These approaches are so similar that differences between them are fairly subtle.


That doesn't need to be the case: we can define that if input of one frozen coin was the output of another frozen coin, it is considered the same frozen coin identity. (I.e. a frozen coin was renewed). Thus there is an option to keep using same identity.
I'd say one of clear advantages frozen coins have is that when you have a new application which uses frozen coins and it gets very popular, new users won't have to wait for a long time before they can start using it.
Although it is just a pragmatic advantage rather than economic consideration, as it doesn't apply to a situation where system is already established, and everybody who wants frozen/delay coins already have them.
Another difference is that when you do not require coins to be marked in a particular way, people might offer signatures associated with old coins which just happen to sit in their wallets for tiny bribes, as it doesn't cost them anything (if we assume that ECDSA isn't broken and computational costs are negligible). Thus people can farm their own coins.
They can also [farm frozen coins]( but economics is a bit different. 
All in all, I'd say it warrants further research.

Neat. But it's worth noting that for derivatives they use notional amounts, it's not real, the actual economic effect is much smaller.
E.g. imagine Alice and Bob sign a contract which says "Alice owes Bob 1 trillion dollars, Bob owes Alice 1 trillion dollars". In theory, it's a trillion dollar contract, that's the notional amount. But it cancels out so the actual economic effect is zero.
That's how derivatives work too, by design they mostly cancel each other, only a tiny fraction is actually payable.

If you have 10^10 algorithms they must have something in common, i.e. they will be built out of certain blocks. So the question is, are these blocks CPU instructions, or are they more specialized?
If they are very close to CPU instructions, then an ideal ASIC for this hash function family would be a CPU which is restricted to permitted building blocks.
Perhaps a more fruitful approach would be to focus on memory-hard operations. If algorithm efficiency requires large amounts of DRAM then ASIC component will be largely irrelevant, and DRAM is already a commodity.

Well, suppose  Alice has some gold in a bank cell, she issued gold-coins 'backed' by that gold, i.e. there is a promise to exchange gold-coins for physical gold. It might be a legally enforceable contract, there might be some legal structure which prevents fraud (e.g. a trust).
Anyway, there is a secondary market for these gold-coins. Bob wants to buy some of these gold-coins, but he doesn't know if his counter-party is Carol (trustworthy) or Mallory (scammer).
But it doesn't matter because it is possible to check if those are genuine Alice-gold-coins, i.e. Mallory cannot fool Bob.
So the problem we're solving is secondary market trading, trustworthiness of issuer is a problem which lies out of scope of crypto-software. Hopefully we'll see developments in this area, i.e. legal structures which actually work.

Having fixed denominations and single-use addresses is a good idea: this can, indeed, drastically improve privacy, at expense of higher space requirements.
The rest is bullshit, though. 
1. We use blockchain to achieve consensus over who owns what in a decentralized environment.

ChromaWallet users do not need to check transaction hashes, as issuer's identity is resolved _before_ asset definition is installed, not after. It is supposed to work like this:
1. User goes to issuer's web site, for example, 
2. Gets asset definition from there.
3. Installs it into ChromaWallet.
In this case identity is confirmed through issuer's SSL certificate, so transaction hash check is pointless.
It is also possible to verify identity via PGP, i.e. asset definition is signed by issuer, and issuer's public key is signed by somebody user trusts.


Yes, Amazon would be able to prove that. The problem is that CoinPrism's user interface doesn't make this check a requirement.
I.e. suppose scammer creates his own "Amazon coins", which are not linked to Amazon.com. Will wallet show them differently from normal "Amazon coins"?
SSL infrastructure is going to help you **only if** name of a coin is the same as the name of the domain, **and** you disallow all coins not linked to SSL certificates.
Otherwise spoofing coins is trivial.

I'm 30 and I haven't seen a check in my life. That's not because I'm a retard, it's because they are rarely used in this country. Salary is deposited directly into a debit card account, for example. None of payment methods people typically use here can 'bounce', so I'm simply not familiar with a concept of bouncing.
It is one of the problems of the banking system that it works differently in different countries, and international transfers are somewhat of a problem. (I receive international bank wires routinely.)

Usually, when somebody invests into a company, he expects that company will be able to reach certain revenue targets in future.
E.g. let's say I invest $5M for 20% of equity, I would break even if company will be worth $25M, but people expect positive return on investment, so it only makes sense to invest it company _can_ be worth, say, $100M or more.
And to be worth $100M or more, company needs to have revenues on the same scale (well, it depends on the industry).
Thus if company's business plan shows that it is expected to generate $20M in yearly revenue, it's very unlikely they'll get $5M investment. Investors of that kind invest only in things which scale.
Yes, Coinbase makes money on exchange, each time somebody buys or sells bitcoins they take a small commission (difference between buy and sell price). Also they offer payment processing: when somebody pays in bitcoins, merchant pays 1% to get those bitcoins converted into USD.
This is an obvious monetization approach, and it can deliver high revenues and profits -- but only if the trade volume is big. And it will be big if there will be a lot of users, i.e. when Bitcoin will get mainstream, so to speak.
So that's a part of their business plan. Coinbase did the integration for Overstock for free, and I doubt they get a lot of money from fees. They aren't yet looking to optimize their revenues: getting Overstock on board can pave a way to mainstream adoption, and that that point they can start getting huge revenues.

Here's the most plausible story I can think of:
1. Yakuza learned about a nerd who controls almost a billion USD worth of untraceable digital cash. (This was the case in winter.)
2. They go to that guy, M.K. and tell him that he needs to share if he wants to live.
3. M.K.: "Not cool, I don't want to go to jail."
4. Yakuza: "That's something which we can handle, you just need to make it looks like it was hacked... Delay it as much as you can."
5. Coin from cold storage go to yakuza, Mark gets his share too.
6. Mark uses tx malleability as an excuse. Of course, people call him on his bullshit, but it's not 100% clear case.
7. Several months later they declare bankruptcy.
8. **Yakuza uses their connections to make investigation as slow and toothless as possible.**

A new coin would have a lot of teething problems: lack of presence on
exchanges, unstable exchange rate, shallow market.
Decentralized exchange needs a base currency, and a new coin will make
it virtually impossible to conduct  any serious trading.
E.g. imagine that a company raise $1M by selling shares, receiving $1M
worth of "new coins" won't allow them to withdraw this amount of money
in USD, as selling it on exchange will crash the price.
Currently, Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency which has the biggest market
liquidity, infrastructure etc.
For this reason, I believe it is the best for decentralized exchange
ChromaWallet can be seen as a Bitcoin wallet with additional
functionality rather than a completely separate thing, and so, I
believe, it has better chances to get popular within the existing
Bitcoin community.
For example, you can see that BitcoinStocks subreddit mentions colored
coins in sidebar: 
Finally, Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies are secured via mining, and
Bitcoin has biggest 'hash rate'.
Colored coins which exist in the Bitcoin blockchain will be just as
secure as Bitcoin itself against double-spending.
That won't be the case for a new coin.




I believe that the main advantage is integration with Bitcoin as I
described above.
Another advantage is that we'll deliver usable wallet software sooner
than competitors.
(Well, I hope so. We had a lot of delays, but I think we are still ahead.)
Comparing specifically to Mastercoin, colored coins has a simpler and
more efficient design, which allows us to implement thin wallet (does
not require downloading whole blockchain) which doesn't have to trust
external services.
Our design is also more flexible and modular, it would allow fast
transactions and fast trade without sacrificing security too much.
You can find tech details here:
and here: 
Now about disadvantages:
1. Mastercoin has built-in betting, CFDs, "escrow-backed user currencies".
2. Mastercoin trade is slow, but doesn't require on external services/networks.
3. Projects which aim to offer these features natively (Etherium,
Freimarkets) have numerous advantages, particularly they are more
friendly to 'thin wallets' in the long run.




Yes, we assume that issuer will sign some sort of a legally binding
contract, but it is out of scope of the protocol.
It is buyers responsibility to check this contract, verify issuer's
identity and so on.
I see colored coins more like a platform for various applications,
rather than a final, directly usable product.
For example, some company can create infrastructure for trading houses
which are represented with colored coins:
 legal contract templates, registry of properties and so on. It might
offer it as a service.
In that case there will be some sort of a legal document which says
that a colored coin represents ownership of house,
and a transaction which transfers colored coin can be seen as a
digital document which transfers ownership to another party, digitally
signed by an existing owner.
Some applications do not require this legal infrastructure: it might
be a matter of trust or reputation.
It is already the case with "Bitcoin stocks" which are traded on
unregulated exchanges, and it can work the same with colored coins.
In any case, my goal is to provide a tool which can be used for
tracking ownership of tokens, trading tokens etc.
It's up to other people to find the best ways to use it. :)


Yes, there are plans to implement things like that in future, but the
immediate plan is to focus on simplest and most straightforward uses.
It's worth noting that Bitcoin itself has support for certain forms of
contracts, and colored coins are compatible with many of them.
(Before I got involved in colored coins development, I had a plan to
implement some kind of derivative trading service using plain Bitcoin
contracts, but it didn't get past planning stage.)

~3600 new bitcoins are being created each day, some of them are sold on the market to cover electricity and other costs. If half of them are sold, at the current price it corresponds to $612k per day, $18M per month.

So a slow downward trend is kinda expected, people have few reasons to buy bitcoins.

This is a strange question. Suppose I live in Ukraine and work for a guy from Sweden. When he pays me for the work I've done, he converts SEK to USD, sends them via international bank wire, I receive USD and convert them to UAH.
What's the point of USD? Well, it a _medium of exchange_. In theory, it is possible to send SEK to Ukraine, but in practice, few banks offer SEK-denominated accounts, and I'd lose a lot on conversion because there is no SEK liquidity in Ukraine. (Actually I've been using EUR for some time, and then switched to USD because USD spread is considerably lower due to higher liquidity.)
Thus, if anything, Bitcoin can be a medium of exchange for international trade. To be fair, USD is good, but the problem is that USA can (to some degree) control the trade, e.g. they can create problems for banks which facilitate sale of Iranian oil. Even if trade is done through European bank, that bank needs accounts in US bank, and US bank can freeze/close those accounts.
In simple terms, if you piss off the US government, it will ask US bank to ask your bank to close you account, OR ELSE...
Thus a medium of exchange which isn't controlled by any particular country is desired.
Bitcoin is both a medium of exchange and a payment system. As a payment system, it provides certain advantages, so you might prefer to use it for those reasons alone.

You do not understand how tech works.
Are you paid to spread FUD or is it your own initiative?
First of all, let's note that a transaction is not something which happens, it's simply a signed message in a special format. When this message is included into a blockchain, all nodes will take into account the changes.


LN wallets exchange signed messages which are unconfirmed transactions.


Signed message is just a piece of data, you can transfer them very fast, indeed.


They are transactions.
For you as a non-developer, transaction is some mythical thing which somehow _happens_ on the network.
For me as a developer, there's no mystery in this. Transaction is simply a signed message. When you submit it to node, if it's valid it might enter into mempool, and will be eventually mined (or discarded).
But non-submitted transaction is still a transaction.
I implemented Bitcoin wallets and I know how it works exactly.


No. There's no counterparty risk, it's not based on trust.
@_date: 2014-08-10 15:26:51


Off-chain transaction provider can be an independent entity which works directly with Bitcoin network. Banking system is a network of banks heavily regulated by the government.
This means that off-chain transaction providers can operate with much lower overhead and higher transparency.
Besides that, there is a plenty of things which can be used to reduce risks associated with off-chain payments.
For example, if you work with banking system, you probably keep your savings in banks. E.g. you might have $50k on a savings account, and you're risking the whole amount.
But in case with Bitcoin, you always have an option to keep bitcoins in a normal wallet. Thus  you won't have a large sum in off-chain transaction system. Let's say you keep around $100 and instruct your main wallet to refill it when necessary. Then you risk only $100. Losing it is bad, but not as bad as losing $50k, isn't it?
It's possible to design it in such a way that you won't risk even your pocket money. E.g. it can be done using micropayment channels. Of course, it is impractical to create a channel for each merchant, but you can work through intermediary:
    user-&gt;intermediary-&gt;merchant
Intermediary won't be able to steal user's money, in the worst case it won't forward money to the merchant. But this will quickly be discovered.


Well, of course off-chain transaction systems which are basically web sites (mybitcoin.com, inputs.io) suck, and they are easy to implement. We haven't yet seen _properly_ implemented systems.


Nope, if you're bitcoin-only it can be very cheap.

To get this list without relying on a trust party you have to scan the whole blockchain.


If there is a trusted party which can provide you a subset of transactions satisfying particular criteria, you could verify a payment using only a subset of transactions.
But the problem is, you can as well just ask that trusted party to verify the payment, as you depend on its trustworthiness in either case.

It's impossible to avoid content moderation on the web. On the web one person can impersonate thousands of users and post millions of messages. So if you consider content moderation censorship, then every web site which is not totally overrun by spammers does it, and this definition isn't useful.
But is it really censorship?
True censorship works on the scale of countries. E.g. a country might forbid atheism to be mentioned. Then people living in the country might not be exposed to the idea of atheism because all the media is being censored.
But web site moderators have no power to censor the entire web -- they can only restrict what is being posted to the web site they control. People can still learn about stuff which is being "censored" from other web sites.
So no, it's not censorship, it is moderation. People who cry about censorship are either over-dramatizing it, or have their own agenda which they want to push.
Now the question is, is moderation policy too strict? Is it unfair?
I think everyone would agree that removing messages like "Buy vyagra at xxyyya.com" should be removed, yes?
But cryptocurrencies is now a 300 billion dollar industry, and obviously, it makes sense to advertise cryptocurrency on a cryptocurrency forum, and spammers can be a bit smarter.
So instead of "buy vyagra" they'd post something along the lines of "I heard Bitcoin has scaling problems, just learned XYZCoin solved it, check it out!".
Or even more complex: user foo will complain about slow conformation. User bar will say that he just learned that XYZCoin solves it.
And since billions of dollars are on stake, you can be sure that all kinds of malcontent **will** be posted. So a good cryptocurrency forum is impossible without heavy moderation.

Attacker can run multiple fake nodes in order to get some advantage. Of course, he doesn't need to run many full node instances, it can be just one server behind many IPs, for example.
Bitcoin security depends on a client knowing the longest chain, so, in theory, Sybil attack can be used to provide to present another chain instead of the longest one.
For example, client might connect to 8 random nodes and ask them about the longest chain. If all 8 nodes belong to an attacker, he can control what chain client will perceive as the longest one.
On its own it is useful only for denial-of-service, but it can be a part of a more complex attack (like stealing money via double-spending).

Yes, creation of new currency token is not the important part. The important part is existence of a common currency which is used for transaction fees.
Bitcoin PoW consensus mechanism works when there is a constant and relatively predictable stream of rewards which are there to be claimed by any miner who produced proof-of-work.
Now imagine that miners are rewarded via some kind of private deals. You can't analyze such a system, and thus you can't trust it. Who knows, today miners keep the network secure, tomorrow they'll help to facilitate an attack.
If miners' incentive structure is not well-understood, you'll be better off with a network of non-anonymous notaries.
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:58:43


I'm just trying to figure out what I'm missing. People seem to believe that side-chains are going to be secure, but from what I know, PoW-based double-spend protection is closely tied to incentives.


That point will be far in future, presumably transaction volume will be high enough for transaction fees to be a significant incentive. Also we'll have a plenty of time to think about protocol improvements.
For example, it is a motivation for proof-of-activity research, PoA paper has a section on "tragedy of commons".
Also, I believe we might have at time of subsidy halving: if miners' electricity costs are more than half of their revenues, mining won't be profitable after subsidy halving. Thus, if they are rational, they will turn off their mining devices, and hashrate will drop. Then this latent hashing power might end up being available for attackers to rent. Scary shit.

Yep, it only works in a combination with an oracle which makes sure that a private key is destroyed.
E.g. user creates a transaction which sends coins to 2-of-2 multisig where one key belongs to an oracle, oracle creates and signs nLockTime'd refund transactions and immediately destroys its private key, user will publish his transaction after he receives a refund transaction.

How do you make a web wallet without writing your own crypto?
If people followed your advice, we'd be stuck with Bitcoin Qt.

@_date: 2014-11-13 19:54:44
Colored coins benefit from transaction graph being validated by Bitcoin miners. Thus we only need to validate colored coin amounts (colorvalues), which requires less data/work: a subgraph of transactions linking a specific coin to the genesis transaction, not the whole blockchain.
Thus validation complexity depends on the size of a transaction history of a specific color. It can be a problem for heavily-traded colors (e.g. gold).
I think the most practical solution right now is to use issuer-signed snapshots: client  only need to validate history up to the latest snapshot.
While this isn't ideal, it can be an acceptable trade-off.
And for things like a smart property (which exist as a single unit) you will (usually) have relatively small history, thus there is no need in issuer's involvement.
@_date: 2014-01-26 12:35:49

He could have re-written the whole chain, up from the genesis block.
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:45:19


Wrong. 
An entity which controls more than 50% of hashrate can ignore blocks produced by others, thus making sure that 100% of blocks in the longest chain comes from it.
Also, domination in hashpower lets one to rewrite history. Say, last 1000 blocks.
This means that coins awarded to miners over the last week are now invalid, all payments using those coins are invalid, and instead attacker gets 1000 blocks worth of coins.
This isn't a theory, this attack was demonstrated in practice on alt-chains.
Please do not pretend that you're an expert when you do not understand how it actually works. It looks like you don't even realize that the longest chain wins, that's like Bitcoin 101.

I'm sure there are creative ways to warn public about seizure without making it obvious.
For example, Mark could have signed a message, say, "these coins were seized" using cold wallet keys and published these signatures anonymously. This could serve as an evidence, but there is no way to prove that Mark did that.
And again, gag order doesn't mean that they'll kill you on spot, they'll have to prove that you violated order, and it is hard.

Normally bitcoin wiki is a good source of information, but this particular article doesn't explain or address anything.
Well, if attacker can easily recover private key from a public key with very little effort, _it is impossible to differentiate between normal user and attacker cryptographically_.
This is a very serious issue, basically there is no way to recover from it using software alone.
It is possible to save money which sits in addresses for which public keys were not revealed:
1. We need something like a "consortium of good miners", miners who can be trusted. 
2. Transactions will be sent to them in encrypted form, they won't announce them.
3. They will mine blocks which will send coins to a new format of addresses using transactions which were submitted privately.
There is no way to save coins of people who revealed their public key (e.g. who re-use addresses).
Note that most likely attack on ECDSA will attack a lot of computational resources, so attacker won't be able to spend everything overnight, and thus people will have a plenty of time for upgrade and it isn't a big deal. So the scenario above is extremely unlikely.

Well, the thing it, it works, in a way many bitcoiners have not anticipated.
Alt-coins are _not_ scams, they are a part of 'free market'.
p2pool was supposed to be a solution for Bitcoin... If it fails, we have Litecoin which has more decentralized hashpower (anybody can mine on GPU). If it fails, Peercoin with its proof-of-stake might take the lead.
We also have NXT and Ripple...
It is survival of the fittest. It's not guaranteed that Bitcoin is the fittest, it is the first cryptocurrency of this kind, not necessarily the best.

People use banks mainly for two reasons:

2. to do transfers, payments, etc.
Bitcoin allows one to do same thing without a bank. The difference between "keeping your money under mattress" and keeping bitcoins is that you can keep bitcoin private keys in an encrypted form and in multiple locations.
It is true that bank-like services can exist for Bitcoin, but baseline is different, it is provided though Bitcoin network itself.

If market is efficient, there is no difference between reinvestment by investor and reinvestment by operator.
E.g. consider an operator like CEX.IO selling fixed-hashrate bonds. Somebody who owns them can spend 50% of dividends to buy more bonds, thus increasing his total hashrate.
Now suppose I create another company, let's say KEX.IO, which will sell shares with growing hashrate: initially one KEX.IO will be backed by 1 GH/s from CEX.IO, and later 50% of proceedings will be reinvested, 50% will go to KEX.IO shareholders.
Are KEX.IO shares more valuable than CEX.IO bonds? Absolutely not, they are exactly the same.
So reinvestment makes no difference.
But... What if operator is able to buy hashrate at below-market price?
Certainly that would be cool. In that case reinvestment will be worth a premium.
But how does it work? How does one systematically beat the market?
Suppose that the current price on CEX.IO is 0.005 BTC per GH/s, and KEX.IO operator is able to buy at 0.004 BTC per GH/s. Thus KEX.IO's internal reinvestment will beat CEX.IO's manual reinvestment.
But... Others can buy hashrate from the same source from which KEX.IO is buying. Suppose another guy, let's call him JEX.IO will buy hashrate at 0.004 BTC per GH/s, and sell it to retail investors at 0.0041 BTC per GH/s. So again, shares with reinvestment (KEX) is not better than without reinvestment (JEX).
To summarize, premium for reinvestment is essentially investing into goodwill: you believe that your guy is somehow better than others who operate on this market. Is this reasonable?

It is a promo material written for an alt-coin called [BitcoinDark (BTCD)]( you can see many references in text.
It's much easier to pump and alt-coin when there is some innovation behind it (even if tiny), as people will speculate on an alt-coin which might become a next big thing. There are several alt-coins which focus on anonymity, to name some, Anoncoin, Darkcoin, and a bunch of CryptoNote-based, e.g. Monero.
BitcoinDark is another alt-coin like that, and this paper is supposed to make it look like there is real innovation behind it.
But there is absolutely no substance behind it. It all boils down to two well-known anonymity-improving tricks:
1. avoid merging coins (transaction outputs)
2. avoid re-using same address
But it's something which can be implemented in any Bitcoin wallet, you don't really need 'telepods' to do that.

Proof-of-work-based blockchain security relies on economic incentives. In other words, it may be secure only as long as mining may be profitable.
Thus the Bitcoin blockchain cannot be secure without Bitcoin as a currency.
However, other blockchains (based on the same technology) can and do exists, they are known as alt-chains and alt-coins. But most of them are nowhere as secure as Bitcoin, as Bitcoin, being the most valuable cryptocurrency, provides biggest incentives.
I don't see plausible scenarios in which Bitcoin fails, but other blockchains thrive, thus I don't think that this statement is true. That's not to say that it's impossible, but it's just too far into speculative territory.

No, it doesn't require "bug-for-bug" compatibility.
In case with encryption libraries, there is a standard which describes how they should work, data formats, etc. And implementors should implement just that. In most cases, they don't need to care about bugs in old software.
But in case with Bitcoin, code is the specification. If there is a bug in consensus-critical code, all future versions should have exactly the same bug.
In the message I linked above, Peter Todd mention bitcoin-ruby. It implements the Bitcoin protocol  in the way which makes sense. However, it is incompatible in some minor quirks: Bitcoin Core scripting implementation produces strange output instead of failing in one of exceptional cases. While bitcoin-ruby generates an exception. (Which makes sense.)
This means that a block which won't be rejected by Bitcoin Core will be rejected by bitcoin-ruby, and thus if one inserts such a transaction into a Bitcoin block, bitcoin-ruby will follow a fork which doesn't have that transaction, which can be exploited.
So again, Bitcoin is very much unlike other things people are producing. Crypto libraries come close, but still not quite it: in case with Bitcoin, you can't even tighten rules and fix quirks.

From what I understand, it relies on SPV on the Bitcoin side, i.e. requires certain amount of side-chain confirmations before a bitcoins can travel back.
Bitcoin scripting language isn't rich enough to be able to do arbitrary checks, so it has to be hard-coded.
Previously, Gregory Maxwell described CoinWitness proposal which rely on SNARK proofs. If we add SNARK support to Bitcoin, then anything would be possible :). But SNARKs are not ready for the prime time yet.

If I understand correctly, you're using a total number of addresses used since the beginning as an independent variable in your model.
The plot which was posted before used variables of a different nature: 1) number of unique addresses used in 24h period and 2) number of transactions in 24h period.
Unlike a cumulative number of unique addresses, these variables aren't strictly increasing over time. so it might be possible to use them to predict drops in price.


I see, but previously Metcalfe's law was used with a different variable, so you haven't proved that your model fits better.
I see a theoretic problem with your model: as total number of addresses keeps growing, Bitcoin price cannot go down. So it works only if Bitcoin keeps growing.
To summarize, if you get a good statistical fit it might be a good model of Bitcoin growth, but not necessarily the best model.

We don't know mtgox wallet addresses, that's the point. People identified potential addresses, but that's not enough.


It is possible that bitcoins were stolen through their compromised system.


Let's assume hot wallet sends transactions only through eligius. If you see a transaction involving mtgox wallet addresses which wasn't relayed through eligius, this means that hot wallet privkeys are used by something other than hot wallet. I.e. hot wallet privkeys were stolen. 


Yep. BTW if Eligius kept rejected transactions, this could be used to verify tx malleability hypothesis.
But the most interesting question is about use of cold wallet. Even if mtgox systems were compromised, coins stored in cold wallet couldn't move by themselves. We need to know whether Karpeles fed cold wallet coins into hot wallet as he claims, or whether coins from cold wallet were withdrawn bypassing hot wallet (which implies an inside job).

Well, the idea is to discourage the use of pools, at the same time reducing risks for online mining nodes.
E.g. suppose limited-withdrawal private key gives an ability to withdraw 1% of coins. You give LWPK which holds 100 BTC to a pool, and pool will be able to steal 1 BTC. There is a huge incentive for pool operators to steal.
On the other hand, if you mine at home using LWPK, and your computer is compromised, attacker will get 1 BTC. That's bad, but not as bad as losing 100 BTC. And this gives you a warning early on (as you might use same computer to process 100 BTC sitting in the cold storage), so in some sense it is beneficial.

Let me guess, you haven't figured out how margin calls work?
@_date: 2014-06-29 15:14:31
Well, there are different kinds of attacks.
1. Meni assumes that attacker is only get a fraction of total hashrate (less than 50%). In that case number of confirmations is what matters. (If we assume instantaneous propagation.)
2. However, if attacker is able to _rent_ enough hashpower to overpower the network, and his costs are proportional to required amount of computations (i.e. to energy spent on them), then what matters is time it takes to confirm a transaction, but not number of confirmations.
Most alt-coins can be mined on GPU or CPU, and hashrate is fragmented over many alt-coins. So they are vulnerable to the second kind of attack: attacker can get hashrate either via multipools, or by paying for cloud computing. So faster confirmations do not make them more secure. (Except a situation where one would consider accepting zero-confirmation transaction: 1 confirmation is always better than zero.)

Well, I was in Donetsk when this "rebellion" have started, and I saw that it just makes no sense if you believe it is a rebellion.
As you probably know, people living in Donetsk oblast were big supporters of the Party of Regions, which was the ruling party before the victory of Maidan. Yanukovich, the President who was ousted, was the leader of the Party of Regions. He was born in Donetsk oblast, and he was the governor of Donetsk oblast before he was appointed as the Prime Minister of Ukraine in 2002.
The Donetsk oblast council (the local government) consisted of the Party of Regions members, the Governor was also a member of this party.
So, naturally, being the political elite of the region, the Party of Regions led the rebellion against Kiev junta which ousted their beloved President... Oh, wait, it's not what happened.
Initially, the protesters led by Gubarev attacked the Donetsk oblast council, i.e. the local government which was elected by inhabitants of Donetsk oblast in 2010.
How does that make sense? Donetsk people were so much against anti-government protests, until out-of-blue they organized such a protest themselves.
Sounds kinda fishy, eh?
If you look at the facts, it's obvious that these protests were organized by Russia. Gubarev was literally a nobody, he was running some tiny ad agency and was not involved into politics. But days after Russia started a coup in Crimea, looking to annex it, Gubarev led the protest.
But this protests weren't really going anywhere, they only managed to seize a couple of government buildings. Shit really started looking serious only after armed people captured Slaviansk and several towns near it. Later the leader of that squad confirmed that it was formed in Crimea, i.e. it was sent by Russia.
To be fair, many of the Party of the Regions members were covertly supporting the rebellion. So there is some overlap. But Yanukovich became irrelevant soon after he was ousted, it was obvious to everybody.

No, it isn't correct.
If this was true, we would have used centralized systems. 
E.g. a company which issued digital currency backed by gold could also run a trading server which would people to buy and sell gold directly for bitcoins. But the thing is, if the company is able to secure gold in its vaults, it doesn't mean that it is also able to secure the trading server, does it? So many Bitcoin exchanges had security breaches... 
It would be much more secure if this digital gold company would trade gold in large batches (much easier to ensure proper security when it isn't a 24/7 trading server), and day-to-day trade would be done in trustless way using colored coins.
Now imagine you have loaned someone money. Obviously, you trust him to some extent, otherwise it makes no sense. But would you request a signed IOU or promissory note which would be a proof that he owes you money? Or would you just let him to note the amount in his internal books? Normally you would want to have a recourse in case the guy won't pay off the debt in time.
So one of the major problems with OpenAssets is that it makes it very easy for an issuer to destroy the evidence.
Imagine somebody sells $10000 worth of bonds, which are than traded on the exchange. He fucks up and does not want to pay back. So he creates $1,000,000,000 more and immediately sells as much as possible on the exchange. Then claims that his computer was hacked and private keys were leaked.
The problem is that OpenAssets does not distinguish between different issuance batches on the protocol level, coins are fungible and mixable. Thus it's not clear how to deal with it:
1. If we accept the fact that coins are fungible, we have to assume that the debt was diluted, and thus the original bondholders will get 1/100000 of liquidation proceedings (i.e. almost nothing).
2. It is also possible to do forensic investigation on the blockchain level to tell new coins from old. Note that the standard OpenAssets client is of no help here, you would need a specialized client which is able to distinguish different issues.
So the question is, if we need a special issue-distinguishing client for the case when issuer deems untrustworthy, why wouldn't we add that right to the protocol?
When colored coins are used to represent issuer's liability, they might be used as an evidence in the court, it's one of their major roles. So isn't it a good idea to have a protocol which is good at that and doesn't require specialized forensic clients?


Isn't it a good idea to prevent the problem on the protocol level?


You keep saying that OpenAssets are superior, but you haven't mentioned why you think so.

Yes. The problem is that stakeholders will  sign many competing branches if there is no punishment for this.
PoS miner loses nothing by signing a competing branch, and there is always a small chance that that branch can win, thus if he is rational, he should sign all of them.
gmaxwell explains it in more detail here: 
It is, probably, possible to implement rules which will fix this problem, i.e. punish those who do not follow the rules. I'm not sure if PPCoin has anything to fix this problem, likely it doesn't.


This is a major problem with Peercoin, basically you have to read the source and ask Sunny King.
As a cryptocurrency, it is very shoddy, but the general approach seems to be legit in the sense that double-spending is hard.

Thank you, I know how it works.  (I develop Bitcoin software for living.)
The problem was that a mutated transaction has a different txhash when it enters blockchain.
It is pretty much trivial to implement a blockchain parser which will record (ntxid, txhash, block_hash) tuples for all transaction in the blockchain.
If you put this information into a database of some kind, you will be able to lookup txhash by ntxid.
So MTGOX could have a page which would show txhash for a transaction which already appeared in the blockchain.
I.e. if transaction isn't seen in a block yet it shows "withdrawal is pending", once it appears in block it shows "transaction &lt;txhash&gt; is in block &lt;x&gt;".
This way users do not need to know anything about ntxid and there is no need to wait until blockchain.info implements something.
And it is pretty much trivial to implement this

Economics in general is very broad.
Microeconomics can be seen as an extension of game theory, it is based on formal, rigorous mathematical models.
Behavioral economics is often based on repeatable experiments.
I guess you're trashing macroeconomics. It definitely deserves some criticism as it is based on very general models, and it is a huge question whether those models match the reality.
It is true that macroeconomics isn't as rigorous as physics, for example, however, that doesn't mean that it is worthless.
A lot of economists disagree with each other, and you have a right to disagree with them.
And then there is a part where people try to apply economics to real world problems in form of general conclusions. This constitutes what you call "verbiage", and it is the most questionable part. You're right that you accuse it for a lack of rigor, but it is not what economics is. Don't shit on the whole science just because you do not agree with asshole who write blogs!


Where are repeatable experiments in astronomy? Are astronomers supposed to re-create the Big Bang?
Where are repeatable experiments in the theory of evolution?
A lot of science are based on observations, macroeconomics included: they take numbers, plug them into their models, and check what happens.
The problem is that economies are incredibly complex, but models are very general, so quality of fit is very low.

Well, Bitcoin miners can freely choose what fees they accept (it is a configurable option), and Bitcoin users can freely choose what fees to pay.
However, what's lacking is a communication channel between the two, so people rely on defaults.
This is actually reasonable, because currently transaction fees are largely an anti-spam measure, and policies like this are up to developers. (Note that developers themselves are decentralized: you can be a developer if you're qualified.)
Currently, there is no market for transaction fees. But it is expected that it will exist when number of transactions becomes higher and block space will be scarce: in that case transactions will compete for block space.

OK, let's go through conceptual difference first.
Counterparty uses an exchange protocol which relies on ordering of transactions within the blockchain. The advantages of this is that it doesn't require any infrastructure besides the bitcoin network, is completely decentralized, and allows automatic settlement on bets of price of assets which exist on this system without any reliance on 3rd parties.
Colored coins take a different approach: the core layers has no notion of exchange, but exchange can be implemented as a protocol on top of that. The advantage of this is that such an exchange protocol can evolve separately from the core layers. 
The downside of Coutnerparty's approach is that it relies on Bitcoin confirmations. So any action is in limbo for ~10 minutes until confirmation arrives.
On the other hand, colored coins do not rely on confirmations nearly as much. Sure, you're only 100% sure it worked only after you received a confirmation. But you can cancel your offers on any time. Trades are executed in matter of seconds. In future, we'll offer confirmations via a 3rd party (same method as proposed by GreenAddress for instant confirmations) and trade aggregation.
So I'd say that colored coins are more suitable for real-time trade. Another advantage of colored coins is that they are much more compatible with SPV.
Now the state of software is another point, as I mentioned colored coins development is lagging, many features which are possible are not implemented yet.
But that doesn't mean there is a problem with the approach itself, does it?


It's kinda funny that you blame Armory for not being decentralized, while Counterwallet _cannot_ be decentralized.
As for usable GUI, I dunno. ChromaWallet [has GUI]( it works, but needs some improvements, without a doubt.


Were you talking about bets on prices? In that case, yes, Counterparty and similar systems have an advantage here.
I thought you were talking about betting in general, in that case Counterparty offers no advantages, as far as I know.


Um, what do you do with backward-incompatible changes? Isn't that a problem?


Colored coins is a concept. There are several implementations which are currently under development: ChromaWallet, CoinPrism, Iridis.


Much faster trading, compatibility with SPV (no reliance on remote daemons).

The ticket seller will have to set up a server which will perform ticket authentication and facilitate exchange. It is definitely doable, but is associated with some costs (not just the server itself, but also a person which would keep it working and safe), and carries some risks.
The payment processing is the most problematic part. Let's consider two cases:
1. Bitcoin-only. You only need a piece of software to do that, payments will go from person to person directly, and you will just update ownership database accordingly. The problem is that if your trade server is hijacked, attacker can do a lot of damage either by redirecting payments to his address, or by selling fake tickets. So it doesn't matter that your server never touches money, you're still risking an amount equivalent to trade value. Also note that running a server which facilitates exchange might be problematic due to regulations.
2. Fiat currencies... Do i need to explain why processing user-to-user payments is problematic?
So this isn't something which a small, individual company would like to do. They would rather outsource it to a company which specializes in these things, which is how it works now: TIcketmaster, StubHub...
Bigger companies benefit from economies of scale, but they won't pass these savings on to customers. Also they might abuse their monopolist status...
And in what sense would be a centralized system simpler?
A solution like this would need authentication, ownership tracking and exchange components. In one case they are integrated with the blockchain and in another they aren't. It's hard to say what's simpler because you'll be reusing some existing stuff in both cases.
So the proposal is to outsource ownership tracking to the blockchain (instead of outsourcing it to big centralized companies). Then you also get authentication service for free (sort of): one can verify colored coin by downloading the blockchain.
This leaves us with exchange and sale services. Exchange can be done either in a decentralized fashion, or it can be facilitate by some party. It doesn't matter that much, because the blockchain-based ownership tracking system serves as a common layer, you can even mix and match.
A centralized exchange has high fees? You go to another one, or do it in decentralized fashion.
Which leaves us with 'sale' part, which can either be done directly by the issuer (i.e. auction service) or can be outsources to some centralized service which will buy tickets in bulk and then auction them.
Finally, "they control". Higher degree of control is, indeed, beneficial for the seller (if you ignore associated overhead and risks). But not for the buyer. Buyers would rather prefer higher transparency and protection from potential problems. (Imagine rogue admin who will sell fake tickets for bitcoins.)

Wrong. Bitcoin is not designed for in-person transactions. But it is possible to create 'off-chain' payment systems/protocols on top of Bitcoin.
Same thing with block size and fee problem: Bitcoin is useful for large payments and settlements, while smaller ones can be handled by off-chain transaction systems.


Bitcoin is not good for buying groceries, but it is good at making sure that large transaction worth many million dollars is irreversible.
Other cryptocurrencies likes NXT might be better suited for in-person transactions... But do they provide same degree of security as Bitcoin? What makes NXT transactions irreversible?
NXT security is not based on by $100M worth of dedicated ASIC hardware, is it?
NXT is a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency, the idea behind it is that people who own a stake in it would not want to cheat, as that will result in drop of value of their stake.
But what if there was a derivative market so one will be able to short NXT? Short NXT, long Bitcoin, perform double-spend, NXT become worthless, you have lots of profit in Bitcoin.

We cannot prevent scalping entirely, but we can remove advantages they have by creating open, transparent market which gives same access to everyone.
E.g. if there is high demand, people can buy tickets on auction directly from issuer, and scalpers get nothing.
Scalpers can make money by selling tickets to people who are late, but issuer can prevent profiteering by keeping some tickets in reserve and releasing them gradually.
So there will be much fewer opportunities for scalpers to thrive on. If they still manage to make money on it, it will be closer to arbitrage and legit trading strategies.

I gotta tell you, software we have now is simply **NOT DESIGNED** for face-to-face transactions.
Literally. There is a _payment protocol_ which is currently under development ([BIP-0070]( it is supposed to fix this problem you had. But even it isn't perfect.
What you're using now is essentially a limited proof-of-concept. OF COURSE it has a lot of problems. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. It will take a lot of time until we get to true consumer-grade solutions.
Seriously, people who think that Bitcoin is a credit card replacement are seriously misguided. Bitcoin is programmable money, it can be seen as 'the Fed' replacement, but it is NOT a credit card replacement.
Sure, we can have Bitcoin "bank cards". That's what Coinkite does. But it is not what Bitcoin is about.

If you're selling an asset for bitcoins using Counterparty, you're required to follow an awkward multi-step process. It isn't just slow, it is also very easy to disrupt: somebody can bid, and then refuse to follow up with sending bitcoins. (Also, it isn't atomic, so it's possible to lose your money this way: if your payment tx doesn't get into the blockchain in 10 blocks, it is lost.)
There is another advantage of using colored coins: it's possible to submit bids privately, in encrypted form. It might be a big deal, as it disables snipping, etc.
It isn't implemented yet, but it is fairly easy to implement.


Yes, but most people will find it kinda strange if it takes several hours (or days?) to set it up before they can trade. I think this can work for a wide spectrum of things, not just very high-value trades.

Do you understand game-theoretical implications of protocol changes you're advocating?
Zero-confirmation double-spending is a relatively minor issue with a well-known and understood solution (trusted third party for small-value transactions). 
On the other hand, collusion among miners can be a serious issue.
@_date: 2014-10-27 12:46:08
Peter Todd knows how do to the math and knows game theory. Also he knows what features can and cannot be implemented.
So the thing is, Bitcoin transaction fees CANNOT be ting, as, in the long run, security of the system depends on the total amount of fees miners get. Basically, Bitcoin is secure if and only if miners get so much money from fees that they will protect the system. That's the core idea.
So the total amount of fees needs to be significant, and fee per transaction depends on volume of transactions which are processed by the system.

You did not understand that source code. It would be easier to read how [getwork works](


No, that's not how it works. In case with classic getwork:
1. miner gets a block header from a pool, with things like hashMerkleRoot and hashPrevBlock already filled.
3. miner iterates nonce (last 4 bytes of block header) and calculates hash of block header. nonce is the only field miner can change
4. when hash matches the target, block header is submitted (particularly, pool is interested in nonce which miner believes is valid)
Note that "block hash" is actually a "block header hash". Transactions are hashed into hashMerkleRoot, and it is done by a pool.




It simply cannot work that way, the whole point is to find a nonce which makes block hash valid, if block hash is changed by pool, then miners cannot in any way simplify the search.
@_date: 2014-04-13 00:12:07
Full nodes check whether transaction is valid directly.
Thin clients use Simplified Payment Verification, which only checks how many confirmations transaction got. (It assumes that it's unlikely that miners will add invalid transactions to their blocks, as they will lose rewards in their case.)

Firstbits is _much_ worse than OP's scheme, as firstbits cannot be securely resolved on a thin client.

We are talking about JS, specifically.
Blockchain.info's wallet uses bitcoinjs-lib. Which has its own ECDSA implementation: 
If you know a more "rigorously tested" one, please tell them.
However, Blockchain.info uses an old version, which uses random k. Yes, this sucks. But the thing is, 1-2 years ago bitcoinjs-lib was very immature, and there were no other usable ECDSA  libraries for JS, so they got [this abomination]( and for some reason didn't upgrade it later (perhaps being afraid that an upgrade will break something).
Also it's worth noting that BitcoinJ (and, thus, Bitcoin Wallet for Android) also had a problem with not-quite-random k, and they were using, if I'm not mistaken, BouncyCastle, which is regarded as the best crypto lib for Java.
Sure, if you're writing a new wallet today, you should use some library. But just a couple of years ago, good ECDSA libraries were in short supply, and people who implemented libraries were basically the same people who implemented wallets. ([E.g.]( So making this distinction is strange.

I'd argue that Bitcoin isn't particularly good at any of these three properties.
1. Decentralization: The consensus doesn't look very decentralized with a handful of pools being able to control the network. 
2. Security: It worked quite well, but no guarantees about future.
3. Scalability: Lightning can do infinite number of transactions per second, but it's not clear if Bitcoin+Lightning can handle actual real-world payment schedules.
Lightning efficiency gain is highly dependent on channel topology.
None of these three properties is really "solved". It kinda works for now but no guarantees it won't  fall apart in future.

You don't need 51% "of worldwide power", you only need 51% of what is used to mine a particular cryptocurrency.
Only a small fraction of world's computer power will be used to mine coins, and by paying a little above the spot price one might get enough computing power to temporarily overpower it.


Yes maybe 50% less, so two old computers might outpower a new one, so what?


I don't think you understand the scale. The vast majority of consumers owns tablets and laptops, not gaming PCs. They aren't going to mine coins on their laptops.
Few people are going to leave their computers always on to mine coins. It produces noise and heat. A cryptocurrency secured by few geeks isn't going to be very secure, as those geeks will be easily overpowered by AWS which owns huge datacenters with millions of CPUs.

Well, if messaging is used as described above, one can get the transaction itself and relevant Merkle tree branches in the same encrypted message. He only needs block headers to know that transaction was included into the block. (I assume that payer is interested in proving that he have paid.)

It was demonstrated that chains live even after they are hit by 51+% attacks. Participants see these attacks as temporary.
As for revenue, well, miners can rent their hashrate to attackers who use it to attack various chains.


Rosenfeld's paper gives you "max safe transaction value" for a given attacker's hashrate, number of confirmations and block reward. (Table 2.)


Paper implies that you should require more confirmations when you receive large payments. Security isn't unconditional.

When you switch to a different pool, the pool you switched from only loses fees, i.e. about 2% of what you were mining.
However, if you do block withholding attack, you actually suck money out of the pool. E.g. if you're mining at 1 GH/s and do this block withholding thing, you're effectively cancel 50 GH/s worth of pool's profits.
Suppose only 1 of 50 people who are mining realizes that a pool is bad. If he leaves the pool doesn't lose that much. However, if he does this block-withholding thing, he hurts as if 50 people were left. So it is definitely effective against malicious pools.

It is based on the same principle, but it is very different in terms of security.
SPV proofs implemented on the blockchain level must be deterministic. That is, software must decide whether proof is valid using only data contained in the blockchain and in the transaction in question. So it runs a pure deterministic algorithm on that data to get yes/no answer.
But when you use SPV in a client, it is very different: you don't just trust an SPV proof which is provided by a payer, you try to find the longest chain from different sources. Typically SPV clients connect to 8 random Bitcoin nodes. But, besides that, they can also connect to centralized services, such as blockchain.info. If all sources agree, transaction is confirmed. If they don't, then it remains unconfirmed.
There is no need to make it deterministic.
Thus SPV clients aren't exposed to risks sidechains are exposed to.


The attack of this kind isn't probabilistic. A group of miners which is big enough can do it with certainty.

You shouldn't believe what twobitidiot releases simply because he has good reputation.
Twobitidiot was chosen for leaks _because_ he has good reputation, but it says nothing about validity of documents and validity of information in documents.
Bitcoin news affect Bitcoin price on exchanges, and it is possible to make serious money on price fluctuations, so this might be the motivation behind these leaks. (Seriously, do you think it was leaked by good guys?)
The previous leaked document turned out to be highly implausible, according to
 * [Andreas Antonopoulos]( "Based on this blog, it appears their “cold storage” was not in fact “cold” – which is either a stunning misrepresentation of their security or an outright lie. “Cold storage” does not “leak”. **The idea that the funds were stolen, unnoticed, from cold storage, due to Transaction Malleability, strains the credulity of even the most gullible observers.**"
 * [Falkvinge]( "So an obvious conclusion is that the claims of a long-running hack emptying the vault are false."
Basically, anybody with a strong common sense can see that it is utter bullshit, yet it resulted in 600-400-600 price swing. (Which could result in 30% profit over 24h. Not bad!)

Ticket scalpers' profits depend on exploiting ticket market inefficiencies. Removing these inefficiencies would reduce their profits. In an ideal case, the primary seller will be able to identify equilibrium price perfectly, and ticket scalpers will get zero profit, thus they will be put out of business.
But how can the primary seller find that that perfect equilibrium price?
He can use the secondary market to gauge supply &amp; demand. But it can work only if that market has low friction.
So that's the idea. Make a proper secondary market, and the problem would largely fix itself. Somebody can still make some profit on that, but it won't be through arbitrage (i.e. riskless profit) or unfair advantage (buying ticket early when demand is low), but through a healthy trading strategies and prediction.
Now I see that the article never mentions that. I thought it's implied (the original motivation for colored coins was creation of decentralized markets) and Kyle focused on auctions.

I wonder what happens on next reward halving. 
Let's consider a situation where electricity costs are above 50%. There is no way fees will compensate having 12.5 less bitcoins per block, which means mining will suddenly become unprofitable.
If there will be no simultaneous Bitcoin exchange rate hike, hashrate will plummet. But I don't see causal relationship here, so drop in hashrate is possible.
Situation can be avoided if electricity costs are less than 50% of miners' profits, but that would make mining too profitable, no?

Well, I think that mining profitability difference should be rather small in the long run, so you'll get about as much from selling coins as you paid for renting hashpower.


Well, suppose you heavily invested into Auroracoin as you anticipated that price will go up after Icelanders adopt it. So you have a large stash of Auroracoins.
At some point in future, you no longer think that price will go up. (If anything, because it cannot go up forever.) You want to covert your Auroracoins to something else.
There are two ways to do that: with and without double-spending. I believe that for a sufficiently large stash, double-spending will be profitable.
Note that decision to liquidate and decision to double-spend can be considered independent. There are always people who want to liquidate their coins, you can't deny that.
And once person decides to liquidate, he needs to make a decision on how to do that.


I don't think attacker needs to hide his identity. He doesn't do anything illegal, it isn't illegal to fork an alt-coin chain. :)


It depends on how you look at it. I think alt-coins exist for entertainment and speculation. Attacking them can be a source of entertainment,so what's wrong with it?
You know, there is nothing wrong with killing people in game universes since that's what game universes are about. Likewise, it's ok to attack and kill will cryptocurrencies since that's what cryptocurrencies are about.


I think about it in the same way, but so far the progress have been disappointing. Also, they distract from serious developments.

This is why merged mining is a recommended way to start an alt-chain. It takes more effort to start a merged-mined cryptocurrency (you need patches which implement MM + you need to convince Bitcoin miners that it is worthy), but it can be much more secure as it is backed by Bitcoin hashrate.
Another way to do it is to have your coin directly within the Bitcoin blockchain, using a protocol like colored coins, Mastercoin or Counterparty. It doesn't appeal to miner community, but it makes more economic sense, and it will make your alt-coin as secure as Bitcoin itself.

It did. Its candidate was Dobkin.


Previously, the Party of Regions demonstrated strong results in all eastern and southern provinces.
[Here's]( the map which shows percentage of votes for Yanukovich in 2010 presidential elections. As you, he had solid results in Kharkov, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporozhye, Dnepropetrovsk, Kherson, Nikolaev and Odessa provinces. (Also, Crimea.)
Only about a half of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces are controlled by separatists.
So you can look at results in Kharkov, Zaporozhye, Dnepropetrovsk, Kherson, Nikolaev and Odessa. In 2010, they voted for Yanukovich. In 2014, they voted for Poroshenko.
[Here's]( a map of 2014 presidential elections. As you can see, the gray area where elections were not held are relatively small. Dobkin have won in one district of Kharkiv oblast (as previously he was the governor of Kharkiv oblast). Poroshenko won everywhere else.

Chill down. It is bigger in terms of volume.

No, it doesn't defeat the purpose of Bitcoin: Bitcoin stays fully decentralized, and it will be used for large transactions, settlements, moving savings and so on.
But for a smaller transactions, we do not need 100% decentralization, it's not that important when you buy coffee, is it? Multiple payment providers can use Bitcoin as a common medium of exchange, but do tiny transactions without publishing them on blockchain, and instead settling them among themselves.
I think it is a great centralized/decentralized hybrid which uses best parts of both approaches.

AFAIU, TLS provides message authentication (when you receive data from a bank via TLS channel, you know it is from the bank) which can also be used to authenticate messages to a third party. (I.e. after you received messages, you can show a log to a third party, which can now see that data came from the bank). So it provides same kind of assurance as digitally signed statements from the bank. (So it can be seen as a digital signature scheme, a very convoluted one...)
That's the whole point of using tlsnotary rather than just some browser extension. It's all about crypto stuff.

It was [mentioned]( by in bitcointalk thread:


This would require a different redemption procedure, one which doesn't require returning coin to issuer.
Obviously, it is impossible to _prove_ authenticity of a physical work using a colored coin, but it makes cheating harder. Let's assume that association between colored coin and a work is asserted by a reputable, trusted party, and is publicly known.
Passing a colored coin along with a physical word eliminates following threats:
 * selling by a party who doesn't own a colored coin (it is easy to check that he isn't an owner)
 * "double-selling" by an owner of colored coin
It is still possible to cheat by:
1. stealing a colored coin and selling a fake
2. selling a fake and keeping the original
But cheating is harder:
1. needs an additional step, it might be hard to steal a colored coin; theft is detected as soon as it is sold
2. original isn't as valuable once it is detached from a colored coin; and, additionally, person who bought it might still claim ownership over the original
So I think it can be useful as one of authenticity checks and precaution measures, but it shouldn't replace other checks.

Western Union charges a lot, but it is cash-&gt;western union-&gt;cash transaction.
If you do it using Bitcoin, you need two conversions (cash-&gt;bitcoin and bitcoin-&gt;cash), and you're exposed to volatility.
I don't know about Nepal, but here in Ukraine bitcoin-&gt;cash conversion (via a bank card) would cost you around 5%, and on top of it they aren't using the best exchange rate, so in the end it will be around 7%.
If we assume that bitcoin-&gt;cash conversion is just as inefficient, you get same 15% as Western Union charges. Plus extra volatility risk.
So again, none of this makes sense unless you find a good bitcoin-&gt;cash conversion solution. (As well as cash-&gt;bitcoin.)
A lot of people are already working on this, e.g. there are Bitcoin ATMs, partnership with payment systems, etc. But I don't think we already have a solution which clearly beats Western Union.

The main barrier to adoption is that currently Bitcoin offers significant advantages only in several relatively small niches. That is, there  is no "killer app" which will result in a massive adoption.
I don't think that Bitcoin is going to replace credit cards anytime soon. It just makes no sense.
On the bright side, there are probable several hundreds of startups working on different apps and use cases.
However, many of these use cases either depend on, or could benefit from, an ability to convert money between Bitcoin and fiat currency without a hassle. So, in a way, it is a barrier, in a way. But it's not like you'll get mass adoption right after this gets solved.

Sure, there is a plenty of reasons to like the idea of sidechains, but that doesn't mean it's worth implementing.
The sidechains whitepaper didn't address security concerns.
So let's put it straight, you want to push highly-specific, ah-hoc changes to the Bitcoin protocol which will enable security-troubled sidechain design just because you hate alt-coins? What's wrong with you?
Imagine following scenario:
1. 80% of mining power is for sidechains
2. changes to the Bitcoin protocol go live
3. 100,000 BTC is moved to sidechains
4. 6 months later, a different group of miners controls 70% of network, and use their merged mining power to steal those 100,000 BTC

Well, generally people need to get some funding to develop something.
Let's consider two examples:
1. Freimarkets: they are trying to crowdfund it, asking for $200k in donations. That is, approximately 250 BTC. Got only a tiny fraction so far, so they can't start with implementation
2. Mastercoin: was announced at the same time as Freimarkets, offered an investment opportunity, got 5000+ BTC in funding.
So, in simple terms, people fucking love "investment opportunities", but they do not want to donate.
So, basically, if you need funding, some kind of a premine or matercoinish crowdfunding is needed.
Of course, there are people who can do it without funding: as an academic project, hobby, simply because they are dedicated and can afford it. But I guess those people are in minority and do not get as much attention.

I did research on possible ways to implement Bitcoin NDFs back in 2011, and I was one of the first who [implemented it as a service](
I also had a plan to implement it via 'smart contracts', but what stopped me at that time was a lack of multi-sig support in clients... Well, the right solution was to implement a custom wallet, but I didn't know if it's a viable solution. 
Later I described how to do [CFD/NDF]( contacts using colored coins, but it's not really specific to colored coins, you can do same kind of contract using 2-of-3 multi-sig 'escrow', it just won't be tradeable.
So, you see, I did my homework ... a while ago.
So, again, Bitcoin pseudo-NDFs make zero sense for a company like Circle, unless it is some kind of a decentralized company which can't have a bank account.
It might makes sense on an individual consumer level, if that consumer isn't willing to trust his money to a company like Circle. But that solution (using Bitcoin contracts) has a number of drawbacks:
 * doesn't provide a protection against large fluctuations
 * quite likely will have non-negligible costs
 * requires a trusted third party to resolve disputes (perhaps, in a form of oracles ... which is just a fancy name for trusted third parties, I think)
 * will be inefficient and unreliable until you have large volume
As much as I want to see things like that, we aren't there yet.

This sounds plausible, on surface, but when you look at vulnerability discovery statistics, it's much less reassuring. For open-source projects, It's possible to measure average time between introduction of a major vulnerability and discovery/fix.
So we have:
 * [Shellshock]( existed for 22 years, can be used to pwn systems which run CGI scripts (among other things). Thousands and thousands systems do that, so there was a big financial incentive.
 * Debian SSL bug: existed for ~2 years. Could be used to get into server which run Debian via SSH.
 * [Heartbleed]( existed for 2 years.
Are cryptocurrencies different? Unlikely so. Take a look at bugs which were fixed in Bitcoin Core.

Your JS is innocuous, of course. But if your server gets hacked, it will give attackers access to all pages which use this script.
Is this necessary? You have 3-line script loading 10-line script. You can as well just give user this 10-line script and eliminate the potential vulnerability.

So there are three options:
1. only Bitcoin blockchain
2. Bitcoin blockchain + separate messaging blockchain/network
3. separate blockchain
Option 2 lets you to use Bitcoin as a currency (with no gateways and no additional risk) and get your transactions secured by the Bitcoin network, while still offering fast &amp; cheap trade. Thus seems to be the best option if you ignore extra complexity.


I'd say the biggest benefit is that transactions quickly become as irreversible as Bitcoin transactions.

Actually, it is possible to introduce it as a soft fork. But it is rather tricky.
You see, "what is the best chain?" and "what block I should mine on top of?" are two separate questions.
For example, miner might give a preference to his own chain over the current best chain. It is called as a selfish mining strategy.
In a same way, mining software might give a preference to p2pool-produced chain over non-p2pool chain. And if the majority of hashing power will use this modified rule, using non-p2pool version would become very unprofitable.

It doesn't make sense to compare USD monetary base to Bitcoin monetary base: people keep their money on bank accounts, which are counted as M1 or M2.
On the other hand, people can keep bitcoins directly as bitcoins in their wallet, and it is counted as monetary base.
Also, don't forget that saving in USD makes little sense as you'll be losing money to inflation, for this reason people invest into stocks (or use bank CDs which offer interest). On the other hand, (in theory) Bitcoin savings make sense.
So, USD M2 is $11 trillion, on same scale as GDP.
So if you assume that bitcoins are used both for savings and for transactions (like M2 money supply), then ratio is about the same.

This depends on how hot wallet balance tracking is implemented. Even bitcoind's getbalance [can report different numbers depending how you ask]( so I don't want to make assumptions here.
My point is that story is implausible even in the worst case (when hot wallet reports nothing suspicious). After all, it is possible that their fucked up software displayed low hot wallet balance.
Also it's possible that they thought that adding more bitcoins would help even as hot wallet had enough. Previously they had problems with immature outputs, so they are used to the fact that some UTXOs are unspendable despite belonging to hot wallet.

Colored coins is built on top of Bitcoin and are designed to be able to interact with it.
Mastercoin initially was essentially an alt-coin living within the Bitcoin blockchain, but later they added features which do not rely on Mastercoin as a currency.

As for the rest, they are largely independent, but might interact with Bitcoin in some way.

It's hard to explain this if you know nothing about programming...
Files are just sequences of symbols, it is up to a program to decode them and "understand" the meaning.
It is a lot like parsing English. For example, "John ate his breakfast." is a valid English sentence, while "John ate ՅεคนԵɿբนʅ ԺԹฯ ԾЦŤ" is not. You can check if sentence is correct by using English grammar and orthography, and in a same way decoder program is based on definition of file format to interpret it.
Not every .jpg file is correct according to JPEG standard: some of them might be total garbage, while others are subtly broken.
Normally decoders should be able to detect if file is correct, and if it is not they display an error message or something like that.
However, quite often there are bugs which trigger unexpected behavior when corrupted file is being parsed.
That's the general idea. It's much more complex, but you need to understand how machine language works to understand how vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution.


You can put code into any file, but usually decoder will simply ignore it. To trick decoder into executing that code decoder needs to be buggy. Period.
There are very few formats which allow execution of non-sandboxed code. E.g. Excel spreadsheets can have macros which can access local filesystem. It's a different story, that is broken by design.

Wrong. These problems do not affect alt-coins, as they do not depend on SPV proofs.


Are you implying that innovation is only possible through sidechains?
Jeez, man, you're so brainwashed. It is always possible to improve the protocol by adding new features to the Bitcoin mainnet without any sidechains.
But also it is possible that there is a design similar to sidechains, but better security-wise.
For example, I described multi-chain approach similar to sidechains [back in 2011](






The major difference between sidechains and my "hubchain"proposal is that hubchain would rely on interactive SPV while sidechains rely on non-interactive SPV. I'm not saying it's better, but alternatives definitely exist.
Sidechain team provided no security analysis and no justification of why their mechanism should be used.

Well, you can keep 100 BTC in your own wallet which you fully control and 0.1 BTC in off-chain payment service. If off-chain payment system vanishes, it is bad, but 99.9% of your money is intact.
On the other hand, if you have money in bank, it all could be gone...
Besides that, you don't really need to trust your coins to that off-chain payment system (like it was the case with inputs.io), instead multi-signature addresses can be used. This means that **off-chain service won't be able to steal users' funds.**
If it vanishes, you get your bitcoins back in a week.


My point is that Bitcoin lets us to combine normal Bitcoin transactions for larger payments, savings and so on; with off-chain payment systems for small scale transactions. As a result, we can benefit both from trustless, secure, fully decentralized system, and from low-cost, fast off-chain payment system.
I believe this combination is better than what banks/credit card companies give us.


I'm talking about rationality in game-theoretic sense. Say, if miner will replace normal bitcoind with a version which uses different rules, most likely he will only punish himself.
So Bitcoin security depends on miners not willing to punish themselves. If you think it's unreasonable, I don't know what do you do in @_date: 2014-06-27 14:33:30

Well, I read a paper, and it is really about maximizing mining revenues, NOT about "controlling the chain".
It is a threat to Bitcoin security only if miners will flock to the selfish mining pool in hope to get higher revenues. In that case, a pool which has 33% of hashing power can continue to grow until it is fully in control.

This equipment might be available for rent. E.g. see NiceHash.
Many people who mine alt-coins do not really care what they mine. They just run NiceHash miner and it automatically chooses the most profitable cryptocurrency to mine. NiceHash itself is happy to rent hashpower to whoever pays the most.
So Bitcoin security depends on the fact that the majority of hashpower is not available for rent.

You can earn 10000 BTC through double-spending.


The difference is that you can mine a side-chain completely in secret without anyone noticing it, and there is only opportunity cost: you lose fees, which are minuscule compared to what can be earned through double-spending.
BUT also, side-chains are going to rely on SPV on Bitcon side, and SPV is vulnerable to 51% attack, so it might be possible to steal everything w/o double-spending.

We don't really need 50 bitcoin/block reward, it can be much lower. However, we'll get to 3.125 BTC/block reward in ~10 years, and that might be a problem. I think fees will have to play larger role at that point. 
Also it's worth noting that reward halving is a problem of itself: if miners' operating income is less than 50% of revenue, reward halving will make mining non-profitable, so it's possible that the majority of miners will drop off.
Economics of double-spending will be very different at that point: it will be possible to recruit a lot of hashing power to perform the attack. So unless fees kick in, it is possible that halving will essentially kill Bitcoin security.
Let's hope that we'll make it through somehow :)

It looks like everybody here is missing an obvious solution: process orders via a web site. It can work like this:
1. customer enters the bar, sees QR code (and short URL) of bar's web page, opens it in his smartphone
2. adds drinks he wants to the cart: the process is same as with any other online store, should be familiar to anybody
3. pays it off with Bitcoin
4. gets a code
5. says bartender the code.
6. bartender has a tablet with a list of all paid off invoices, so he finds code there, finds what customer have ordered and prepares drinks
This is as simple for bartender as possible: he doesn't need to click any buttons, a quick glance at screen is enough.
It might be somewhat less convenient for customers, as they need to use their smartphones, but in the best case it takes only few seconds:
1. suppose you have bookmarked bar's order page, open it
2. use 1-click button to buy beer
3. confirm payment in bitcoin wallet
4. get the code

There might be a transaction cost/security trade-off.
For example, when you send a million dollars, you would prefer having no 3rd party risk, but it's OK if transaction costs $1 or more.
On the other hand, when you're paying for a cup of coffee, $1 transaction fee is unacceptable, but a risk of loss due to 3rd-party failure is acceptable, as long as it is low. (Say, 0.0001%.)
The good thing about Bitcoin is that it gives you a flexibility to choose what will be optimal for you. Note that conversion can be very smooth, so you can keep your savings in a real wallet, and move small amounts of money to off-chain system to use for smaller transactions.
In the end you'll probably want to minimize the sum of transaction fees and potential loss due to 3rd-party failures.
There are many options for off-chain payments, ranging from 'shared wallet' design (coinbase, inputs.io, mybitcoin.com) to crypto-based once involving "micropayment channels", transaction aggregation, privkey reveals.
Finally, alt-coins and side-chains are also among possible solutions.

While it should be this way:
    var newAddress = gen_new_address();

    showInUI(newAddress);
I.e. new address should be displayed only after it is persisted. When networking is involved, absolutely nothing is deterministic, so it should only show an address after it got confirmation from server.

This is cool, but I'm worried about their abilities to hedge risks. The problem is that for all products they offer, their own position is long on Bitcoin. In other words, when Bitcoin price drops, Neo has to pay.
They need to be able to offset it with a short position, without paying large premiums. This is hard. Bitcoin derivatives markets are shoddy and anemic. And, in general, exchanges are unreliable.
So the way I see it, Neo makes a bet on Bitcoin price going up soon enough (maybe as a result of Neo's actions). Essentially, they have a leveraged long position, so they can benefit a lot... But if Bitcoin price goes down (after they have customers), they have to pay out of their own reserves.
And I don't see how this is sustainable, they'll have this kind of exposure permanently.
Maybe they believe that some kind of a sophisticated trading strategy can make it safe, but relying on this is ridiculous, especially given a state of Bitcoin exchanges.

You forgot the main problem: it doesn't support SPV.
For messages other than Bitcoin transactions, Bitcoin blockchain only establishes consensus about their ordering, but not meaning. So any solution which is based on Bitcoin consensus is not SPV-compatible.
In practice, this means that you need to run something like a full node to verify things yourself. Otherwise, you have to **trust** servers which feed you data.
That's how Counterwallet works, BTW, it just gets information from servers which Counterparty people run. It **cannot** verify information itself. So it's very much centralized, but people don't see through this bullshit. (Often, because they own  XCP.)

Yes, it works as a short-term solution, to prevent a panic, for example.
Ukraine had a hyperinflation in early 90s, it reached something like 10,000% a year in 1993. (i.e. currency lost 99% of its value.)
In 1996 they switched to a different currencies and implemented better policies, which kept inflation at reasonable (but high levels).
Ukrainian hryvna had stable exchange rate (against USD) from 2000 to 2008.
The remarkable thing is that there was a significant political turmoil in 2004, which could have resulted in exchange rate volatility (when you don't know how it pans out, it's safer to convert your hryvna to USD), but harsh central bank's measures kept exchange rate stable, and it remained stable for 4 more years.
Also, it was stable from 2009 to 2013, thanks to progressively more and more hash central bank's measures. 
So, yes, it can be done, you just do not hear about more successful. As to whether it is a good idea is another story. I think it's not sound as a long-term strategy, but is OK when you want to prevent short-term fluctuations.

Opportunistic chain forking is not a problem for PoS+PoW hybrids as making a fork is not free (requires work).

If we're talking about for-profit double-spends, the value of the stake which will be confiscated when double-spending is detected can be used to gauge "a dollar value of protection".

I think it would be good to define what constitutes a proper way to sell tickets (e.g. at least XX% is sold via a public auction, perhaps several auctions should be scheduled), and then to encourage ticket sellers to do it that way. For example, by giving visibility only to those who do.
And to answer your second question, I think a ticketing app should notify user about ticket sales he might be interested in. But only about those which are done properly (see above).

Bitcoin is programmable money and is very flexible, so there is hope that these issues will be solved. However, nobody says that everything can be done in 100% decentralized way, it's a pipe dream.
After all, Bitcoin's core is based on economic incentives which make cheating and attacks non-profitable strategies. Miners are controlled by people, who in principle could  perform an attack, but won't do that simply because it's more profitable to pay by the rules.
Perhaps same can be done with off-chain services.

I am one of co-authors, AMA.
I also recommend reading our [pure PoS analysis paper](

@_date: 2014-06-19 14:59:56
Let's say 10% of stake is online. For N=3, a probability that all 3 stakeholders are online is 0.001. Thus if 1000 empty blocks are generated by PoW miners and spread on the network every 10 minutes, we'll have, on average one complete block every 10 minutes.


All nodes which are mining should do that. Amount of extra work depends on several factors. In the example above, they need to check 1000 blocks in 10 minutes, this is definitely not a problem.
@_date: 2014-04-06 06:52:11


I'm a co-author of paper on PoA (proof-of-activity, PoW/PoS hybrid), and in the appendix of this paper we did analysis of Peercoin's PoS. One of points:




all blocks, as the probability to generate a block is proportional to the amount of coins that a stakeholder
holds. Therefore, from time to time a stakeholder will be able to generate chains of consecutive blocks.


generate a block with probability `1/M` , and the probability to generate k sequential blocks is `(1/M)^k` . This
approximation is accurate under the assumption that the stakeholder holds a number of unspent transaction
outputs significantly larger than k. We can estimate the average number of blocks between groups of k
sequential blocks generated by one stakeholder as a mean of exponential distribution, which would be equal
to `1/(1/M)^k` = `M^k` .


the merchant when she is able to generate k sequential blocks, thus the mean number of blocks between such
attacks is `M^k` . For example, a stakeholder who holds `1/4` of all coins participating in stake mining will be able
to carry out a 6-block reorganization each `4^6` = 4096 blocks, i.e. approximately once per month if one block
is generated every 10 minutes.


value that depends on the transactions that the previous blocks included, i.e. this stake modifier is part of
the prev blocks data in condition (*). Therefore, a stakeholder who obtains an opportunity to generate k
blocks in a row can know about this approximately 6 hours in advance, so she has plenty of time to mount
an attack.
It shows how PoS is inferior to PoW: PoW miner who has 25% of hashrate can't attack opportunistically, while PoS miner who has 25% of stake can do this pretty much effortlessly. (However, an argument can be made that PoS miner will be reluctant to perform an attack as it might affect value of his coins.)
Another problem is bribery attacks, Peercoin has absolutely no protection against them. (I described bribery attacks back in 2012 when PPCoin was originally released.)
We will publish an e-print of the paper soon, you can find more information there.


Well, versions 0.1 and 0.2 were really bad, and ability to create a long chain of blocks has been demonstrated. I'm not sure why it wasn't to mount for-profit attack on exchanges, perhaps bad guys couldn't organize it in a timely fashion. (Robbing bitcoiners is far more profitable?) Also, there is centralized checkpointing, perhaps it can prevent an attack. (?)
Version 0.3 made attacks much harder to implement. PPCoin is theoretically unsound, but in practice it is pretty secure.
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:41:36
Yes. You can choose what address to send coins to in advanced send form.
@_date: 2014-02-17 20:40:37


No, it's important. People who think in terms of "address balances" often believe that all payments sent to one address are automatically added together... While it is not the case.
For example, if you received 100 payments, you get 100 individual UTXOs. To spend them, you need to spend a fee, something like `100*160/1000*minfee`, which is about 0.0016 BTC now. Fee is proportional to number of UTXOs you have.
However, people who aren't aware of UTXOs think that re-using same address is beneficial.


I'm well aware of this fact, but in my opinion it is a bad thing. I mean, it is possible to calculate this balance for accounting purposes, but it definitely doesn't exist on protocol level.
@_date: 2014-04-06 15:50:38
Specialized Bitcoin mining devices (ASICs) are several orders of magnitude more efficient than general-purpose hardware, so it simply makes no sense to mine using general-purpose hardware. (Your costs will also be several orders of magnitude higher.) And people who own these devices know that they need to be careful when they make them available for rent. (Mining pools essentially rent hashing power from device owners. So to attack Bitcoin you need to organize a mining pool which will have more than 50% of total hashrate.)


There are several factors at work here.
One is that alt-coin hashrates are smaller because block rewards are smaller, and renting small amounts of hashrate is possible.
 Another factor is that some alt-coins are being mined on GPUs and CPUs, and renting those is quite straightforward.


A combination of proof-of-work with proof-of-stake seems to be the only fully decentralized and viable solution, but it requires more research.

@_date: 2014-08-11 17:49:36
Yes I have read the paper. Here's the nature of their "invention":
Let's assume that people often need to transfer a whole amount of bitcoins, e.g. 1 BTC, 2 BTC etc. Then privacy can be improved if Bitcoin wallets would:
1. avoid splitting and merging outputs, i.e. if you need to send 2 BTC you send it as two 1 BTC transactions
2. would create a new address for each transaction
then they will enjoy higher degree of privacy, as it won't be possible to infer total amount or link different payments.
Obviously, that won't work if you happen to need to send 1.51123773 BTC, in that case you really need a change output.
So this is simple, but fairly impractical privacy enhancement. BitcoinDark people then added several layers of security-to-obscurity to it, e.g. they call these 1 BTC outputs which get transferred without mixing "telepods".

This companies need large amounts capital to create these machines. It's possible to get it from pre-orders instead of asking funding from VCs. Users will absorb losses in case of delays.
However, even if company knows that it's more profitable to keep device and mine themselves, they are required to ship because contract they have signed requires them to do that.
That's the theory, at least.

Yes, Python is better, but not perfect.
One of important differences is strong typing, i.e. strings are not auto-converted to integers. This means that programmers need to work with types explicitly, which eliminates a lot of problems with implicit conversions.
And, in general, Python is a more mature language, with more consistent feature/syntax.
However, Python  is a dynamic language, which means that in many cases invalid code is detected only when you run it. This is bad.
Java is standard for enterprise software, it has static type checking, so much fewer things can go wrong with it. C# is similar. C++ is used for high-performance software, it is more-or-less acceptable.

In order to trade, parties create and sign 'atomic swap' transaction.
For example, within one transaction Alice sends her gold coins to Bob, while Bob sends his bitcoins to Alice. Trust isn't required as transaction is atomic: Alice is unable to get Bob's coins without giving him gold coins.
Any communication channel can be used for negotiations, thus there is no inherent delays: it is as fast as the communication channel.
On the other hand, projects like Mastercoin and Counterparty use blockchain for communications, and they require order to be confirmed before it can be filled, so completion of trade requires several confirmations even in the best case. (E.g. it takes 30 minutes to execute a trade.)
It's worth noting that in case with colored coins, one might want to wait confirmations to make sure that trade is finalized. However, it is optional (as double-spending is very hard once transaction got propagated), and, if necessary, it is possible to fix this uncertainty with help of a third party:
For example, Carol is trade facilitator, her role is to sign 2-of-2 multi-sig inputs to make sure that no party can double-spend. Neither Alice nor Bob need to give their coins to Carol, thus only a very minimal amount of trust is required. Yet time required to finalize trades depends only on communication channel. So in this case trades are both fast and trustless.

The thing is, it works correctly (and has ACID properties under condition that software/hardware isn't faulty) if you follow common practices and don't do weird things.
Even if you do something like this:

    UPDATE user_balances SET balance = 500 WHERE user_id = 31337;
It will actually work correctly w.r.t. concurrent updates if you use serializable isolation level. Again, it is _designed_ for OLTP, so things you typically need are natural and do not require special care.

So... Let's say there is private army, which is supposed to defend a country. Surely it values its reputation. Suppose they are expected to earn $50B of profits in next 20 years. (Or the net present worth of their profit stream is $50B.) Then Putin comes and offers $100B for them to do nothing.

How so?
To have a cryptocurrency, you first need to establish a consensus over the protocol. And while you're at it, you might as well establish a consensus over **old** history, e.g. stuff which happened a year ago.
Bitcoin protocol specification includes a hash of the genesis block. (To avoid a situation where a new node will get a completely wrong history.)
PoScoin protocol specification might include a hash of a block which was created a year ago. (To avoid a situation where a new node will get a completely wrong history.)
Are these things hugely different? I don't think so.

1. Proof-of-heating doesn't work because: 1) heat pumps are more efficient as a heating method; 2) cold water is more efficient as a cooling method. Home users would be better off using heat pumps (or solar/geothermal heating). And centralized mining facilities are better off dumping waste heat into the ocean.
2. Proof-of-stake: I believe it can work, but it is decentralized only if the distribution is decentralized.
3. Underutilized hardware: interesting idea, but it's not clear what incentives it creates.
4. One thing you didn't mentioned: use publicly-known, non-anonymous verifiers. Like Ripple does. I know that many bitcoiners find this non-palatable, but what's wrong with it?
Imagine that nodes are run by respected organizations all over the world, let's say universities. Obviously, for-profit double-spending won't be a thing, as it is hard to imagine a massive, worldwide collusion (which will have consequences for everybody involved: they aren't anonymous). Can political influence be a problem? Yes, in theory, US government can prevent anybody from the US from running a node. But it is worldwide, so a system can survive without US nodes, and US government will look like fool. Shutting down the majority of nodes would be hard.
Note that it isn't impossible to destroy Bitcoin this way: people who run Bitcoin mining farms are not 100% anonymous (they can be, but they aren't), and control of top 10 mining farms will probably give you the majority ot hashrate.

You have a simple game-theoretic model only if you make a number of non-trivial assumptions. E.g. if you assume that no miner has more than 10% of the total hashpower, that block reward is fixed, that miners do not collude, it is easy to prove that Bitcoin is game-theoretically sound.
But all these assumptions are debatable. Why do we assume that an attacker cannot acquire as much hashrate as he wants?
Consider a situation where 1) there are not specialized devices which can mine bitcoins more efficiently than general-purpose CPUs; 2) computational power is a commodity which has a certain market price.
This means that miners use 25 * 6 = 150 BTC worth of computational power per hour. Thus an attacker needs to spend little more over 150 BTC to overpower the honest mining network for one hour, buying computational power from cloud providers (Amazon EC2, Azure, etc.)
In these conditions he can have a cake and eat it too: he will get both block rewards (150 BTC) and whatever he can earn via double-spending. So this attack costs nothing.
Thus bitcoin security depends on the fact that:
1. highly-specialized hardware provides significant efficiency gains
2. this hardware isn't available for short-term rent (otherwise an attacker could temporarily overpower the honest network by paying slightly above-the-market price)
The second assumption is fairly questionable, as mining hardware owners de facto rent their hardware to pools. (Have you seen [nicehash](
There is a number of other highly questionable assumptions, so if you believe that Bitcoin security is proven, you haven't dug deep into it.

Innovations require changes to Bitcoin protocol, but these changes might break something, so people are holding them off.
It is possible to implement them in alt-chain with it's own currency, but then Bitcoin users won't benefit from those innovations, and alt-chain will have a hard time getting momentum.
Side-chains are like alt-chains where Bitcoin is a currency, so it is possible to implement innovations and give Bitcoin users an ability to benefit from them. (Without investing into alt-chains, which can be risky.)

E.g. we will associate a weight with each user's identity (an unique FrozenCoin). Initially these weights are zero, i.e. we do not count upvotes. Each time user upvotes a link which was upvoted by user X, user X's weight is incremented. Eventually, we will only count upvotes from like-minded users.

I don't think so. The difference is that we can verify colored payment using only blockchain data. And we can check blockchain data using hashes. So we don't need to trust the server which provides this data.
On the other hand, you cannot verify Counterparty payment without receiving whole blocks. So no, it's not the same, not even close.

I've been a Bitcoin user since 2010. I'm subscriber since 2011. I co-authored two academic articles about cryptocurrency consensus. One of which, called [Proof-of-Activity]( analyzes problems with PoW and proposes PoW+PoS hybrid solution.
The question about what secures Bitcoin is still open. Satoshi's Bitcoin paper says that if the majority of hashpower belongs to honest miners Bitcoin can be secure. This is probably true. But can we just assume that the majority will be honest?
There needs to be some kind of a justification.
The paper also discusses a scenario where a large amount hashrate is owned by some sort of a potentially dishonest actor, and it says that he will find it more profitable to stick to the protocol.
But this isn't really true. If we assume that this actor has access to a majority of hashpower, an attack can be costless to him, since he will get full block rewards on top of whatever profit he gets to an attack.
So again, why do you assume that Bitcoin is secure?
Another thing to note is that if we assume that Bitcoin miners are _rational_ rather than honest, then a lot of nasty thing can happen. such as [feather forks](

Hmm, can we provide incentive for whistleblowers? Like, a bounty.

Cold storage is now a norm for exchanges, which implies that they do not believe that they can keep their online wallets secure. Or, at least, they do not want to rely on it.
Running a private accounting server is not unlike running an online wallet. And thus operator should take into account that server might be hijacked at some point. (I'd don't think it is so rare: how many exchanges were hacked or "hacked"?)
So it makes sense to reduce risks as much as possible. Keeping a complete log of all transactions is better than keeping only balances from this perspective: having a log, you can find the point of intrusion and roll back to it.
It's even better if this transaction log is securely timestamped, as it might help in the case attacker will try to double-spend his coins rather than create coins our of thin air. Also it might help if this log is accessible to all users, so they can verify it themselves. Also you need to be sure that this log is safely preserved. Yes you can just back it up, but imagine a rogue system operator wants to destroy your system, quite likely he has access both to the live system and its backups, and he will be able to destroy backups too.
Hmm, an append-only transaction log, which is securely timestamped, accessible to all interested parties, and is preserved (ideally, forever), does it remind you of something?
Sure, you can make your own blockchain and use Bitcoin network for timestamping purposes by putting hashes into Bitcoin blocks. But in that case you would need a separate backup solution.
Even if it's not that hard to make a system which provides security roughly equivalent to the blockchain, why bother if you can just outsource it to the blockchain?


The point here is not so much in trustlessness, as it is in absolving Reddit of the responsibility to process trade transactions.
There are both regulatory issues (if you are processing payments, then you're essentially a broker-dealer, and might need to comply with laws), and security issues (is something goes awry, who's responsible?).


Yep, that's the point. It might take care of some of the nasty issues without costing that much.

Each of transaction's inputs can have a different color. That was true even in the very first protocol we designed.
@_date: 2014-06-25 09:49:28
You assume that transaction data is propagated _after_ a valid block header is created, but that doesn't need to be the case.
E.g. suppose that other miners already know all transactions except coinbase, in that case they can fetch a list of transaction hashes.
And it's possible to share this list ahead of time too. So propagation time can be solved via a protocol update.

At that point it will be pointless, as his chain will be shorter than the main chain.
Stake confiscation is needed to prevent opportunistic attacks. E.g. a stakeholder with 10% of all stake has an opportunity to create 6 consecutive blocks from time to time. In case with PPCoin, he can use that opportunity to do a 6-block-deep reorganization.
But in case with CoA, he needs to wait T0 blocks before revealing his block. If T0&gt;6, it won't work: at that point the main chain will be longer than his fork. (And if he doesn't wait, his stake will be confiscated.)


Well, if &gt;50% of stakeholders have decided to implement censorship, they will be able implement it. But that's the point: stakeholders define the rules of the network.
If somebody having only 10% of stake decides to do it, it won't be effective.

Wrong. Cost of Bitcoin mining depends on multiple factors, and one thing we can say for sure: it will not stay the same. (Unless somehow all factors which change all the time will cancel each other.)
As a crude first-order approximation you can assume that bitcoin mining cost is proportional to price. 
E.g. suppose 144 blocks are produced per day, each block has 25 BTC, each BTC is worth $400.  So you get $1,440,000 total, that's the miners' revenue.
If their profit margin is 10%, the cost of mining is $1296000.
Now let's say Bitcoin price goes to $500, now the revenue goes to $1,800,000. But initially the cost is the same, and thus miners get 28% profit margin.
Higher profits attract more miners, difficulty rises, total cost of mining rises. So eventually we get back to 10% profit margin, and cost will be $1620000, directly proportional to increase in price.

Advantages of colored coins:
1. Trading bitcoins for colored coin is fast, takes seconds. (~15 seconds in current version, can be easily optimized further). In case with Counterparty, trading asset for bitcoin is multi-step process which requires multiple confirmations.
2. In case with Counterparty, bids must be submitted as individual bitcoin transactions. A hundred bids means a hundred of Bitcoin transactions. In case with colored coins, negotiations are done through a separate communication channels, and only one trade transaction is published. So it doesn't pollute the bitcoin blockchain, and isn't as costly to bidders.
3. There is a thin colored coin wallet which uses SPV. That means that it can check validity of transactions without trusting 3rd party servers and without downloading the whole blockchain. It is fundamentally impossible to have a wallet like that for Counterparty. Counterwallet uses remote counterpartyd servers to validate transactions. So your choices are limited to running a full node and trusting 3rd party.
Advantages of Counterparty:
1. If an asset is sold for XCP, auction can be deterministic. (But you're using another currency in that case: right now it is simply impossible to sell an item which is worth $5M because the whole Counterparty's market cap is less than $5M.)

Hardware wallet absolutely needs screen to show what transaction is being signed.
I think it might be easier to adapt existing devices than to manufacture specifically for this purpose.
Say, there are cheap cell phones, they have screen and lots of processing power, so it might be possible to make a custom firmware which implements bitcoin stuff in a secure way.
It might be hard to make sure that it is actually secure (as it might be using bits from vendor's firmware), but there will be no problems with manufacturing.
Alternative approach: MP3 player like [SanDisk Sansa Clip Zip]( $30 in Amazon. Add Bitcoin signing functions to [Rockbox]( open source firmware.

All miners and nodes on Earth will be in sync just like they are now.
Nodes on Mars will get same blocks, but with a delay. _This doesn't mean they are out of sync_. You have no idea what "sync" is.
If distance to Mars is 20 light minutes, nodes on Mars will get blocks with 20 minute delay, but they still get same blocks (because there are no other blocks).
If you make a transaction on Mars, it takes 20 minutes for it to go to Earth, then it takes 10 minutes to get into a block, and then 20 minutes later block gets to Mars. So time to first confirmation is 50 minutes instead of 10 minutes on earth. However, you will get 6 confirmations in 100 minutes vs 60 minutes on Earth, so this is hardly an issue.

First of all, CC is not a monolithic protocol like Mastercoin or Counterparty, it is a concept, for which there is a number of concrete protocols and implementations.
ChromaWallet, specifically, relies on centralized messaging component. But [Iridis]( uses BitMessage.
Why do you think it is important? The protocol is designed is such a way that it is messaging-agnostic, this part can trivially be improved or replaced.
E.g. it would take me like a couple of hours to implement federated network for ChromaWallet p2ptrade (i.e. multiple servers which users can connect to), and this requires no changes to the protocol. I just don't see a point.


This statement is neither true or false, it just makes no sense. We just do not need to "get around this".
It is true that we cannot use the same model as Mastercoin/Counterparty, i.e. a single decentralized orderbook for everyone. But it isn't necessarily a bad thing, as a 'decentralized orderbook' might be a lowest common denominator.
E.g. we might end up with two separate orderbooks: fast private one for bigger players, and slow and less deterministic decentralized one for everybody. While Counterparty has only the slow one. I don't think that having multiple options is a bad thing.

There is no cost to 51% attack: you can have a cake and eat it too: You keep all blocks you generated in addition to double-spending profit.
Economics of this is very complicated, especially when there are multiple cryptocurrencies competing for a same kind of hashpower, when miners have a choice. 


It is not about absolute value of hashpower but about its distribution. Hashpower can be rented, it is what pools do: they rent hashpower to create blocks.
There are miners who are not particularly attached to a particular cryptocurrency, they just want coins. They might mine on middlecoin.com.

"Hybrid Proof of Stake" section doesn't even mention centralization. Vitalik argues that in absence of altruistic stakeholders, it is enough to have 51% of PoW mining power to build a  longer chain. (Rational stakeholders would sign both chains, just in case.)
However, he misses the fact that the whole point of attack is double-spending using a longer chain which is built in private. However, in case with PoA, attacker will have to broadcast blocks he creates in order to get signatures from rational stakeholders, thus he won't be able to build a longer chain in private.
So no, it doesn't rely on centralization, and it is strictly superior to both pure PoW and PPC-style PoS.

The problem is that mtgox can be used for USD transfers:
1. Alice deposits USD into MTGOX account
2. Alice buys bitcoins
3. Alice sends them to Bob
4. Bob sells bitcoins
5. Bob withdraws USD
In practice effect is the same as if Alice transferred USD to Bob.
It really doesn't matter if Bitcoin is currency or not. MTGOX might as well denominate accounts in sausages.
For example, MTFOX could declare that 1 sausage is worth 1 USD. Then Alice could buy sausages, send them to Bob's account, Bob would sell sausages and withdraw USD.

We need to expose their business model: Advertisement brings in new uses, who buy GH/s on the market, thinking that it is a fair market rate. This is how GH/s price stays artificially inflated, and existing users find this service profitable (thinking they can always sell GH/s at this high price).
But this can't go on forever, as soon as the supply of new users dwindles, price will crash. This is quite a bit like a Ponzi scheme: they control the market price by bringing more users via advertisement and selling more GH/s to the market.
Perhaps we can pop this bubble faster by bringing media attention to it. A well-written article which explains how GH/s price can collapse at any time might create a panic and cause this collapse.
Of course, it won't reduce CEX.IO's hashrate, but it will reduce their abilities to obtain funds to buy more hardware, and eventually their share will be diluted.
Also it will show them that it's better to avoid pissing off the community.

No. This is taken out of context: what NSA did was by no means unique.
Cryptocurrency was a subject of academic research since 80s, e.g. David Chaum wrote a paper called _Blind signatures for untraceable payments_ back in 1983.
A decade later there were lots and lots of articles on this topic, many of them describing systems which are way more sophisticated than Bitcoin.
Satoshi wasn't the first guy to think of a cryptocurrency, he was the first who found a simple, practical solution. When others were trying to invent advanced cryptographic constructs which would guarantee anonymity while keeping it decentralized, Satoshi combined simple, well-known components to make something which is good enough.
So I don't think there is a NSA trace in this. Bitcoin was, if anything, underwhelming, people were surprised that _this_ can work, but it did. And there is nothing special about NSA when it comes to cryptocurrency research, as far as I can tell. They just do a lot of research, on a variety of topics.

Nope. Currently doge's hashrate is 78.97 GH/s (if CoinWars is right), you need at least that much.
(In context of "51% attack", attacker needs more than 50% of a total hashrate, including his own. E.g. if doge's normal hashrate is 80 GH/s and attacker brings in 80 GH/s from somewhere, the total is 160 GH/s now, and attacker has 50%.)

A protocol where output can only be spent completely is somewhat simpler, which is a good thing when you're dealing with cryptosystems.
Suppose protocol allowed partial spending. So Alice has a 10 BTC output and pays 1 BTC to Bob. Bob modifies Alice's signature, so transaction has another hash, and submits this modified transaction. So he gets paid again.
In the end it looks like Alice paid 10 times even though she signed only one transaction. Thus Bob will be able to steal 9 BTC from Alice.
Of course, this can be fixed by using immutable transaction hash. But that conflicts with Bitcoin Script system.
So support for partial spends would have required removing script features.
It's much more straightforward to allow only complete spends and use change addresses. As a side effect, the use of change addresses helps privacy and removes some potential cryptographic vulnerabilities. So the way Bitcoin works is definitely better design.
Change addresses are only a problem for broken or misused software.

Well, here in Ukraine the local currency (hryvna) is "weakening", but people use USD and EUR for savings. That's a norm.
Selling Bitcoin to these people would be tough. You can't deny the fact that bitcoin exchange rate is highly volatile, so at best it is a speculative asset, rather than "credible store of value".
There are people who do not trust USD, but they would rather buy gold.
I think the only way to make Bitcoin attractive as a store of value is to show how it is fully independent of banking system (USD deposits in Ukrainian banks aren't very safe) and cannot be physically confiscated. Maybe this will make bitcoin attractive despite its high volatility: people can see it as uncorrelated asset which might be useful in emergency situations.
But I doubt a lot of people know what 'uncorrelated' means.

The problem is with disambiguation: Two (or more) colors can point to identical color definitions, how can users distinguish them?
When asset definitions are installed explicitly, it it up to the user to install the valid one. (E.g. he will install the one which is recommended by a person he trusts.)
But if asset definitions are automatically picked up from the blockchain, user doesn't have to choose. Instead he _might_ check its validity after the fact, but we know that most users are too lazy to do proper checks.
So I'm afraid you'll need to have a centralized list of "featured colors" once copycats will become a problem.

Well, it's possible to have multiple separate currencies within one blockchain. Colored coins can be used to do that without modification to the protocol, but it's also possible to implement 'native' colored coins, maybe with many additional features. (See: freimarkets.)
Each such currency will have its own distribution (say, you can distributed it to residents of a certain country a-la AuroraCoin) and its own exchange rate, but all of them will share blockchain, and thus security aspects of it.
I'm not against alt-coins, but we don't need hundreds of it, that's pointless. If somebody has some brilliant tech idea, something which requires protocol changes, I'll be happy to see it as an alt-coin. 
On the other hand, if somebody just wants a meme-themed cryptocurrency, it can be done using colored coins (or a similar approach). It need to be a separate currency, not a separate blockchain.
I think that when colored coins tech will be widely available and established, we'll see much fewer alt-coins created, and many of existing ones will die out.
Migration from one chain to another (as well as colored-coins &lt;-&gt; separate chain) is possible, in theory. But might be problematic from organizational perspective.

You've got it backwards. The problem isn't in "demand for dollars", the problem is that the government implements anti-free-market policies, and people exploit them.
When government forces goods to be sold below the market price, people can make money on arbitrage, and thus the black market flourishes.
The reason why every dollar is controlled by the government is that dollars can be used for cross-border black market trade.
Bitcoin can be used for the same purposes, and this the government will ban Bitcoin as soon as it becomes non-insignificant factor.

Because doge is relatively secure, attacking it is hard to impossible.
Dogecoin and Litecoin are dominating in terms of hashrate, and it would take about a half of Litecoin hashpower to attack it. I doubt that you'll be able to convince 50+% of Litecoin miners to do that.

I don't think you can solve the problem of volatility completely by technical means. Stabilizing the system from within itself, without external anchors, is just not going to work.
It's easy to see the principal impossibility of such a solution. E.g. imagine the solution exist, e.g. you can take bitcoin, apply some kind off a smart contract, and get an instrument which closely tracks the value of dollar.
But you can do the same with any cryptocurrency, e.g. you'll be able to get the same dollar tracking instrument within dogecoin. Moreover, you can create a new alt-coin, which is worthless at start, apply this black magic, and make stable dollars out of it.
This sounds like a violation of conservation laws.
So you have to limit how much volatility the system can absorb, and it is practical only when those limits are relatively small.
E.g. if only 10% price movement is covered, much less capital is required, and people might be interested to offer it as an insurance policy of sorts (i.e. they will expect that sum of collected premiums is higher than the sum of payouts).

1. This won't affect ordinary users: "Once a sidechain is operational, it is possible for users to exchange coins atomically between chains, without using the peg. In fact, this is possible with altcoins today, though the independent prices make it harder to organise. This is important, because as we have seen, direct use of the peg requires fairly large transactions (with correspondingly large fees) and long wait periods. To contrast, atomic swaps can be done using only two transactions on each network, each of size similar to ordinary pay-to-address transactions."
2. Good news: anybody who has enough hashpower can unlock your coin (and if merged-mining is used, it is essentially free for him. Bad news: he doesn't need your consent to unlock it... Basically anyone with enough hashpower can steal all the coins from mining-based sidechain. (Of course, that doesn't affect the _federated peg_.)
3. Totally.
4. If a sidechain is secured by mining, there is only one rule: one who hash the majority of hashpower controls (and thus, owns) all the coins.

The method we use now (each node verifies the whole blockchain) offers ultimate security.
Verifying only last N blocks will correspond to SPV-equivalent security: attacker who hash enough hashpower to overwrite last N blocks will be able to steal all the coins.

Yep. It is better to borrow those coins, if possible. A serious attacker might offer bitcoins held in multi-sig address as a collateral, so it is not implausible.


Yes, it is more like a theoretic illustration of why alt-coins can't grow big: when they are big enough, it becomes possible to attack them.


It doesn't matter because you're protecting against one specific model of attack. It doesn't protect in case attacker borrows those coins, or just happens to have them for a long time.
E.g. suppose that I own 1 million foocoins, and I no longer need them. I can just sell them on an exchange OR I can perform a double-spend attack and sell them multiple times. Which is more profitable?
If it is profitable for sufficiently large sum, then you can expect that every rational large holder of an alt-coins will try to sell them via double-spending.

Well, you can do a crowdsale by offering your tokens on sale via p2ptrade. I'd say that's the most straightforward way to do it. :)
If you want to do something like "each owner of X can also receive Y", you can do it in two ways. The simplest way is to get a list of all owners of X at certain block height, and send them Y. But then the issuer is responsible for postage costs.
Otherwise, you can create a color kernel which corresponds to the rule "each owner of X can also receive Y". You'd need a custom client for that kind of stuff.
Finally, there is also a better version of "proof-of-burn": color-your-own. I.e. users can color their own coins using a transaction with a certain marker in it. Then the value of coins created this way cannot be lower than value of bitcoins which were 'colored'. This floor value makes it better than proof-of-burn (which is also possible within colored coins model).
All in all, a lot of interesting things can be implemented, but requires a custom kernel. But then again, it's fairly easy to implement a custom kernel using coloredcoinlib, the only question is how to deliver it to users.
@_date: 2014-08-06 18:20:02


You need 0.5 XCP to register an asset.
(And then you will need some bitcoins to send those coins.)


It depends on what color kernel you use. With OpenAssets cost is negligible.
With epobc it is 1 satoshi per atom of colored coins. (But these satoshis can be reclaimed when coins are uncolored, in other words, there is a bottom value of your colored coins.)

I live in an European country. Never understood why we even have an army. We are surrounded by friendly, civilized countries, they aren't going to invade us. And we don't want to invade them either.
And political leaders didn't seem to care about the army either, as it was severely underfunded.
So I was thinking this way for decades, but this year life taught me a lesson: my country was invaded by one of those "friendly, civilized" neighbor countries.
One who follows the news would correctly guess that I live in Ukraine. And I happened to live in the part which was invaded.
A year ago I believed in economic incentives and the fact that people are rational. But it turned out I severely underestimated a degree to which rationality is bounded. (I.e. people are stupid.)
I wish all you staunch libertarians saw it with your own eyes... Basically, what happened is that the state lost its monopoly on violence. We went from a mostly centralized violence (police force) to a mostly decentralized one. And no, it wasn't cool.
In phase one, "protesters" stormed one of the government buildings, and the police was unable to defend it, was too reluctant to apply violence. So it became the protester HQ. It was like 500m from my home. It was eerie to see barricades growing around it, seeing "protesters'" "self-defense" people when you go for groceries.
The result was elevated level of crime. Many of so-called self-defense forces were former criminals. You know, if you have a stable job, you probably won't join self-defense, as you have better things to do. But it was a great opportunity for the homeless, unemployed, and former criminals. They had a chance to get some weapons and some protection against police. Also regular criminals felt that the police became weaker and scared...
I've heard quite a few chilling stories, but it didn't affect me personally, and it wasn't that bad...
On the phase two, mercenaries hired by Russia were able to capture a whole town. And Ukrainian military was too unprofessional to get it back. (Although I think to a large degree it was sabotage on the leadership level.)
On the phase three, when Ukrainian military was able to get its shit together and nearly crush the "rebels", Russia sent its regular forces. (Russia denies that, but it was confirmed by the former Minister of Defense of the Donetsk People's Republic in a public interview.)
So, yeah, now I see how an army (and a state) is kinda useful. And I don't think it can be replaced with a private structure, because private army will have bad incentives. And "starving the beast" is actually a bad idea. (Again, creates bad incentives.)
If you are against war (who isn't?), you should be for things like direct democracy, education, e-government etc. Basically you want to control your government, so it won't be able to start a war. But just getting rid of the army cold turkey is a bad idea. Speaking from experience, you know...

Well, I've seen decentralized search being used in practice back in 2004, I think. It in eMule, a file-sharing program, which had Kad network (based on Kademlia DHT design) for file search. It was a bit slow, but still impressive  if you take into account given number of clients and files on that network.
The difference between a simple keyword-based search (which can be trivially implemented using a DHT) and a Google-like search engine is ranking. Ranking is hard.
It doesn't look like YaCy even tries to approach ranking, for example, when I search for 'bitcoin' it gave me this as a first result:
    bitcoin | netzpolitik.org
    bitcoin | org. https netzpolitik org tag bitcoin.
    
and another time I got this:
    Bitcoin - BloombergHT.com
    Bitcoin com. http www bloomberght com etiket bitcoin. bono borsa dolar...
    
It would be even more of a problem if there will be a lot of users and everybody will try to push up their content higher in the ranks. How do you ensure fairness?
Complex queries are also a major problem for decentralized search engines. E.g. imagine that there is a million of index entries for `foo` and there is a million entries for `bar`, and if user wants documents which have both `foo` and `bar`, server has to find intersection of these sets.
I don't know how YaCy handles this, but from what I see it doesn't handle that well.

I'm aware of this argument. But it's a bit too high-level for the game theory, in the sense that if you try to bring the game theory into this, you'll end up with prisoner's dilemma.

No. Subjectivity might boil down to "trust the developers" or "trust big companies". People already do it now when they use software from bitcoin.org, or when they use wallets provided by Coinbase and Blockchain.info.
So I'd say it's not about adding more subjectivity, it is about using subjectivity which people already use anyway in a more efficient manner.


Absolutely not the same thing. It is one thing to rely on trusted parties for day-to-day operations, and another thing is to give the veto power.
Basically, you can still rely on PoW or PoS as a primary consensus mechanism, and rely on trust only in doomsday scenarios.
And this is absolutely not a new thing, it is already the case:
 * Satoshi rolled back the blockchain when a bug which allowed one to create billions of bitcoins was exploited
 * devs were involved in resolution of March 2013 fork, encouraging miners to switch to version 0.7

Next version of Bitcoin-Qt will support it (BIP 0070).

Without payment protocol Bitcoin is simply not ready for wide adoption, it is too random and error-prone.

Not at all. Counterparty uses a fundamentally different approach. (Coin-based vs balance-based.)
We do not need to change anything in colored coins protocol to enable private bidding, it is implemented in the protocol which works _on top_ of the core protocol. The core protocol is very minimal, and things like trading and auctions are done on different levels. That's why it's so flexible. Say, it would take me 2-3 days to implement an auction app, and it will be fully compatible with wallet software since it uses the same core protocol.
On the other hand, Counterparty uses all-in-one approach where trading is implemented via protocol rules.

Both PoW and PoS attempt to address Sybil attack.
Imagine a naive consensus system where one node has one vote. Attacker could spawn millions of virtual nodes and change consensus however he wants. To disable this kind of an attack, we need to link votes to some kind of scarce resources, so that votes will be scarce too.
In case with PoW, such scarce resource is hashpower/electricity.
In case with PoS, coins themselves are a scarce resource. The main advantage is that you don't have to waste electricity to secure the network.
People say that PoS carries an additional advantage: stakeholders have a vested interest in keeping system healthy.
However, claiming this isn't enough, you have to prove that it is true, and it's sort of hard.
I don't think that it is unconditionally true. For example, consider Byzantine/Rational/Altruistic model where Byzantine participants want to destroy the system even if that costs them money. They can start doing this kind of attacks without regard to devaluation of their stake. (They are Byzantine only in context of this model; perhaps they do not care about devaluation of their stake because they own a lot of put options.) Once damage is done, rational participants will join them and start doing double-spends as well. So system remains in unhealthy state even after you remove Byzantine participants.
So it is kinda complex...

Eh... Mining contract is just a derivative. It makes no sense to buy it if it is not profitable to do so.


Accessibility of Bitcoin is absolutely unrelated to mining. It is a widespread misconception that the right way to acquire bitcoins is through mining.
Miners simply exploit temporary imbalances between mining profits and cost of electricity/equipment. Miners do not inherently get a better deal than an average person buying bitcoins via exchange.
If you want to own gold, would you buy bullion or start mining? Is gold accessible?
What's about fuel for your car: do you own shares of Shell? Do you trade oil futures? Or do you just buy gas as normal people do?
So again, trading mining contracts is like trading oil futures: it is better to leave it to people who can do the math.

This isn't surprising even a bit to anyone who understand economics.
[The basic theory]( says us that the price index depends on money supply (i.e. how much money people and corporations have) and velocity of money.
But the Fed cannot affect money supply, it can only affect monetary base, i.e. the amount of 'hard money' which exists in the system. Money supply is affected by commercial banks: lending creates money. (I.e. when commercial banks lend more money to people, more money is available to them, right?)
The Fed bought existing debt securities using freshly-created 'hard money'. This have increased the monetary base. But it didn't affect the inflation that much. Why should?
Swapping treasuries for money is rather boring. Suppose you're a company who has some extra cash invested in treasuries, let's say $100M of them. Then you sell them to the Fed, getting $101M. Kinda cool, but it hardly affects anything.
Having US gov't securities is practically the same as having US dollars, US treasuries are the safest securities in this regard, so swapping one for another is uneventful. That's why QE barely had any effect.

It is interesting, but it's worth noting that it isn't a problem for merchants to accept multiple cryptocurrencies, especially if there is a payment gateway which does conversion automatically.
Russia has multiple competing payment systems, so merchants often choose to work with a payment gateway rather than with a one specific payment system/wallet. E.g. [Robokassa]( supports 10 different payment systems (which are essentially e-wallets), in addition to other options.
Bigger merchants accept multiple options directly, e.g. take a look at [this monstrosity]( (reg.ru is like a GoDaddy of Russia).
So I'd say merchant/user/developer network effects create very small barrier for entry.
Mining and liquidity might be more important. However, strictly speaking, mining is not required for a cryptocurrency to be secure, as there are other ways to achieve consensus (e.g. Ripple).
And liquidity is only relevant when you consider minted currencies (a-la Bitcoin), but there are workarounds... Say, if JPMorgan would like to offer its own cryptocurrency, it will be way more liquid than Bitcoin.
So, to summarize, there is a plenty of effects are work, but they might be relatively weak (depending on circumstances).

Blockchain.info takes into account this unconfirmed transaction, after which balance is 0.
But a concept of balance doesn't exist on Bitcoin protocol level. What matters is presence of other transactions which spend same outputs. It looks like blockchain.info isn't aware of double-spends, so transaction is still valid. But it has a small output and pays no fees, so miners who follow standard rules won't accept it into a block.

Bitcointalk.org vulnerability can make **a lot** of damage.
 * People use it for trading. (E.g. for selling ASIC miners, but there is a whole section.)  If forum has vulnerability, somebody might be able to impersonate a reputable trader and sell non-existent goods on his deman. 
 * Hacker might replace Bitcoin addresses posted on forum to steal money which are sent to those addresses.
* If hacker gets access to users' passwords, he might be able to access other sites (e.g. exchanges) people use (as people often re-use password) and steal their money.
 * Forum posts often link to binaries (programs), such as Bitcoin clients, mining software, utilities, etc. Hacker might replace those links with links to trojan-infected software, and thus infect users' computers and steal their coins.
 * Forum might be a source of important announcements. Hacker might impersonate a reputable person to post a panic-causing announcement.
E.g. somebody might sell his bitcoins, make a post on forum saying that a critical vulnerability is found in Bitcoin protocol and that he sent details to Gavin, and then post from Gavin's account saying that vulnerability is confirmed, it is advised to shut down everything and wait until fix is made. People who see this will dump bitcoins on exchanges, and hacker will buy them, to get more bitcoins than he had before.

Let's not bring philosophy to this. 
You need to consider conditions in which cryptocurrency will fail.
 * PoW: attacker has more computations power than the rest of the network (which usually means that he has to spend more energy than the rest of the network)
 * ideal PoS: collusion between a weighted majority of stakeholders
You can't compare these conditions directly, but you can estimate theoretic cost of attack.
I believe that 1 billion USD is currently enough to destroy Bitcoin: you can build a lot of hardware and spend enough energy to rewrite the whole chain.
And to defeat a PoS system it is enough to buy a half of all coins. If market cap is higher than 2 billions, it would cost you more than 1 billion.

Sorry, but it looks you're quite a bit confused. Numeral systems (_base-10_) and "units of measure" are orthogonal.
For example, when you say "256 bits", 256 is a decimal number (even though it represents a power of 2).
It is true that bits are intimated linked to powers of two, but it's not because of they are inherently "base-2". Powers of two appear in two places:
 * a random variable with N equiprobably states has entropy of `log2 N`. Thus 10 bits correspond to `2^10 =` 1024 equiprobable states. Number of bits itself is usually represented as a decimal number.
 * In modern computing tech, various storage units/memory sizes are usually of size 2^N . This is done for convenience reasons: when everything is power of two, it can be nicely aligned. For example, a 64-bit register can be used to store two 32-bit values, or four 16-bit ones and so on.
However, this is done merely for convenience/efficiency reasons. You can see [all kinds of word sizes in old systems]( -- 36. 27, 25 bits.
As for kilobytes being 1024 bytes, it is again, for convenience reason: computer memory sizes are usually `k*2^N ` bytes, and 1024 is pretty close to 1000, so people started calling it this way, colloquially. But it is inconsistent with SI which defines _kilo_ as strictly 10^3.
Later IEC 60027-2 A.2 and ISO/IEC 80000 defined `kibi` prefix to be 1024, but people keep using 'kilo' in a way which is inconsistent with international standards.
This can be a source of confusion, as storage manufacturers use SI prefixes correctly.
So-called "binary prefixes" were never in use in telecom industry in context of transmission speeds, as there is nothing special about, say 1024 bytes per second (second itself is pretty arbitrary), thus kilobit is just 1000 bits per second.

The problem is that there is no open source implementation of OpenAssets protocol. (It can be used as a reference implementation, as a basis for custom products, etc.)
@_date: 2014-06-23 12:37:00
SPV is 'Simplified Payment Verification'. To verify a colored coins payment  we need two things:
1. Check whether it was included into a block. It is the what Bitcoin clients like Electrum and MultiBit do.
2. Check a path of transactions from that transaction in question to genesis.
On the other hand, in case with the approach which is used by Mastercoin and Counterparty, you need information from the whole blockchain to verify a payment.
As far as I know, Counterwallet simply asks several counterpartyd servers. That kinda defeats the purpose of using the blockchain. If that's the level of security you're targeting, you'll be better off with Open Transactions.


Yes, but they had an incentive to implement Counterparty: if Counterparty is successful, they have return on investment.
That's not the case with colored coins, there is no way to invest into colored coins as a protocol.


Modifying a Counterparty-like protocol is very problematic, as it will likely result in different clients interpreting messages in a different ways, which has same result as Bitcoin fork.
Colored coins isn't a specific protocol, so implementing a different flavor of colored coins (with different rules) is not a problem. Besides that, clients only need to agree on coloring, and all the rest can be modified as needed.


Well, let's say Alice wants to sell 10 Foo for 1 BTC each, Bob wants to buy 10 Foo for 1 BTC each. They enter that information, their clients post their offers, sees that they are matching, and then they (clients) negotiate the details. In the end a transaction which is signed both by Alice's and Bob's client is published on the Bitcoin network.
Currently it doesn't support partial fills, but that's not hard to implement, we just haven't got to it yet.
Usually ~10 seconds pass between order being submitted and a transaction being published on the Bitcoin network. But there is no theoretic limit, it can work much faster.
Of course, a transaction which is published on the Bitcoin network can be double-spent, but it is rare for well-propagated transactions.
p2ptrade clients need a communication channel. Currently we use a centralized service simply because it's the easiest thing to do. But any kind of a decentralized network which can facilitate communication is suitable for this, we can even use multiple networks at the same time.


Can you show me where? I believe it is a fundamental limitations which Counterparty and Mastercoin have. Fixing it would require a complete redesign of the protocol, no?

Yes, omission of a single transaction can affect validity of subsequent transactions. There is no way to prove that something wasn't omitted.
That's the difference between output-based and message-based approaches: 
 * in output-based approach all dependencies are explicit, thus you know what information you need to fetch
 * in message-based approach, dependencies are implicit, i.e. anything might depend on anything, thus you need to fetch everything to make sure it is correct
But implicit dependencies are required for certain features like automatic CFD and bet resolution.

And now they are out of money, even though previously it was mentioned that they have more than enough. And there are no reports.

They can still use colored coins technology for that.
To do that, you make a color kernel which makes use of 2-of-2 multisig mandatory, which the first key belonging to the owner and second belonging to reddit.
Then reddit can easily make owner authentication mandatory, it won't approve transfers to non-authenticated addresses.
Here are the benefits compared to private accounting server:
1. Cybersecurity risks are drastically reduced, hacking into reddit's server won't have a significant effect.
2. Buy and sell shares for bitcoins in a trustless manner. Again, reddit doesn't have to run an escrow server, as payments happen directly between users.
3. Transparency.
4. Shareholder will be able to authenticate themselves to 3rd party services. (E.g. one can easily make a chat which is exclusive to reddit shareholders (thus is troll-free?))
1. Need to pay fees for every transfer.
2. High-frequency transactions require additional software layers.

Cool, but the thing is, bitcoin network currently doesn't allow transactions with outputs less than ~5400 satoshi. So you won't be able to transfer less than 5400 shares.
Or you can define that one share is 5400 satoshi, then you need 54 BTC to issue 1 million shares.

Oh, I had this very idea a while ago (like back in 2006), got obsessed with it, and even quit my job to implement it... But processing payments was really problematic in pre-Bitcoin time, so I focused on collaborative filtering aspects of it, and, basically, got lost in it.
One problem with it is that mechanics of investing into content is rather tricky. If it is bitcoin-based, it needs to be a zero-sum game, you need both winners and losers. Many different approaches are possible, I think generally they fall into following categories:
1. Ponzi-like: Each post (entity which can be upvoted) is independent, people who invest early would earn some money, people who are late will lose it. Fairly easy to implement in a decentralized system. Can be combined with a raffle. People will be reluctant to invest when they are late.
2. Parimutuel: All invested money is collected into one pool (e.g. on a daily basis) and the best entries win. Which entries are the best? If you define that entries which have the most money wagered on them are the best, you have a problem that wealthiest people are going to win, and it has nothing to do with quality. Perhaps you can solve this by having two different groups of people: one will invest into posts, another will vote for them. (E.g. using FrozenCoins as Sybil-prevention.) But it still can be prone to abuse.
3. Prediction market: Roughly the same as parimutuel.
4. External revenue: People invest by buying shares (like they do on the stock market), hosting platform displays ads, revenue from ads goes to shareholders. I'd say it is the most straightforward approach, but is also a bit boring.
5. Reward points: Instead of earning bitcoins, people get some kind of 'reward points'. Then it is no longer a zero-sum game, but I'm not sure how it can work.


What's the role of moderators? If they control who gets rewarded, they might collude with people to whom rewards go.
If their role is simply to remove ads, I'd say it would be better to incorporate ads into the same system. If it is zero-sum game, ads will end up being losers (as people will downvote them) and money will go to quality content. Thus ad campaign money will go to content producers, which is good, no?
Anyway, I now have a different idea, which, I believe, can solve problems which arise when you "replace karma with bitcoin tips".  It is a new kind of money which works differently from Bitcoin and might be more suitable for karma-like things. Actually I was going to introduce it in one article with FrozenCoin (FrozenCoin can be a part of it), but decide to split it into two.

This means that you've been lied to, and these "rebels" simply seized control of the territories on pretense of protection of nazi invasion. At this point you were supposed to re-evaluate trustworthiness of your news sources.

We do it using padding. 1 satoshi is too small, so we add, say 8192 satoshi to it, recording it as `2^13 + 1 = 8193`. Somebody needs to provide these satoshis, you can't create 1 million outputs for free.
There are two advantages:
 * If shifts the burden of providing 'padding' from issuer to end-users which create tiny outputs. If issuer sends 10000 colored coin atoms, he needs no padding. If user then breaks it into 10000 one-atom outputs, he will need a lot of bitcoins for padding.
 * This constant can change over time. Dust threshold was around 5500, now it is 550. Perhaps, one day we won't need any padding, then all coins used for padding can be freed up.

Is buying a home with cash so outlandish?
E.g. suppose you start working at 20 and save $10k per year. By the time you're 30, you have $100k in savings and can buy a home and start making kids.
Add to this that without widespread use of mortgages house prices will be lower (relative to salaries).
Another option is "Islamic banking" kind of thing: some individual or a group of individuals will buy a house and let you live in it, while you accumulate savings (in case with Bitcoin, savings can be sent to 2-of-2 multisignature address so that no party can spend bitcoins without a consent of other party). Once you have enough money to buy this house, you do that. (Investor gets some kind of premium, perhaps monthly pseudo-rent payments.)

Well, suppose you have a list of honest nodes H_1...H_n.
Attacker comes and creates nodes A_1...A_n. Of course, honest nodes know that those are impostors, and will flag them as untrustworthy.
But attacker's nodes also claim that honest nodes are untrustworthy. The situation is 100% symmetric, and an external observer who isn't aware of the history cannot tell which ones of them are trustworthy.
Likewise, a new node will use bootstrapping mechanism and will find both A_1...A_n and H_1...H_n, or some subset of thereof. And he won't be able to tell which group is lying.
So... what if bootstrapping mechanism will only give one H_i, but not A_j?
That would be cool, but in that case consensus depends on the party which controls the bootstrapping mechanism (e.g. DNS records).

Isn't it because they have different interest?
Like, they visit sites which cover finance and tech news less often... But that doesn't mean they are less interested in cryptocurrencies, no, that's different.
You seem to have a problem with logic reasoning.


OK, I'll explain. I follow multiple Bitcoin-related mailing lists (e.g. svbitcoin), I'm moderating a Bitcoin-related Facebook page (so I see who 'likes' posts), I constantly get linkedin invitations.
In all these cases I see first names of subscribers, and almost all of them are male first names.
So there are definitely fewer females interested in Bitcoin, unless there is some global conspiracy which doesn't allow females to subscribed/post to mailing lists, like Facebook pages and so on.
Also argument about atmosphere/lack of interest in meetups doesn't apply here, as these places are places for intelligent discussions or just sources of information, and they aren't in any way offensive to females.
Now it's possible that the problem is in lack of exposure to the idea, but I don't buy that argument, as in this day and age everybody has same access to same sources of information, and filters it _according to his interests_.

Absolutely not the same thing! Bitcoin SPV clients require no trust when a payment protocol which sends tx information from sender to receiver is being used, client can then verify this information directly. (Well, if we assume that there is no problem with finding longest chain/invalid blocks created specifically to fool SPV clients.)
In the worse case, when no information from sender is received, nodes can hide payments from client, temporarily (until he connects to other nodes).
On the other hand, in the case with Mastercoin, omission of a transaction might make client to accept payment which is invalid, it's much worse and is uncorrectable.

As Vitalik mentioned in the article, the main problem is with new nodes who have just joined the network and cannot know how it evolved over time.
Nodes which are always online, or go online periodically, can easily thwart an attack. E.g, they might just refuse reorganization going deeper than, say, 1 week back, which is the same as 'rolling checkpoints'.
But a new node cannot use this mechanism.
Thus we need a mechanism to bootstrap new nodes, and Vitalik's point is that a little bit of subjectivity won't hurt.

Multi-step process is inherently non-atomic, thus you need to consider different scenarios in which it is aborted in the middle.
Suppose Alice owns XCP and wants to sell them, while Bob has bitcoins and wants to buy XCP.
Normally there are three actions:
1. Alice posts an order to sell.
2. Bob posts an order to buy.
3. Seeing there is a match, Bob sends BTCPay.
There are three possible scenarios:
1. Bob sends BTCPay and it gets into the blockchain before order-match expires. In this case order is considered filled, all is well.
2. Bob sends BTCPay, but it gets into the blockchain after order-match expires. In this case Bob loses his bitcoins.
3. Bob doesn't send BTCPay. Order-match expires.
Obviously, Counterparty developers are aware of this issue, and in fact they spent a great deal of effort to alleviate it, [as you can read in the specification](
But the specification doesn't tell you the whole story. (It isn't a detailed description of the protocol, it only gives you a general idea... Not sure why they call it a specification.) You gotta read the source code. [Deep down in order.py, you see this](
            # Calculate when the match will expire.
            if block_index &gt;= 308000 or config.TESTNET:      # Protocol change.
                match_expire_index = block_index + 20
            elif block_index &gt;= 286500 or config.TESTNET:    # Protocol change.
                match_expire_index = block_index + 10
            else:
                match_expire_index = min(tx0['expire_index'], tx1['expire_index'])
Here's what it means:
1. Initially, order match expiration was customizable, and thus could be arbitrary low. E.g. 1-2 blocks.
2. Protocol change starting from block  (Feb 18, 2014): order matches now expire in 10 blocks after match.
3. Protocol change starting from block  (June 26, 2014): order matches now expire in 20 blocks after match.
So, apparently, there was a problem: if Bob's transaction doesn't get into a block soon enough, he loses his bitcoins. Counterparty solved the problem by bumping expiration 
So, apparently, 10-block interval was too small. Is 20-block interval big enough?
You never get 100% guarantee.
On the other hand, Bob might intentionally let order-match to expire, forcing asset-seller to wait 20 blocks (~3 hours). To address this issue, Counterparty has fee_required/fee_provided mechanism: basically, Bob is supposed to include higher-than-usual Bitcoin fee in his order.
So, while it is technically possible to buy and sell Counterparty assets for bitcoins using DEX, people just don't do it, as it it can be a frustrating experience (risky, slow and expensive).
You can see yourself: XCP/BTC [order book is empty]( while there is a plenty of activity on SJCX/XCP and SWARM/XCP. Why does that happen, is Counterparty better as a currency?
Obviously not, it's just that BTC is severely crippled on Counterparty's DEX.
If BlockScan is right, [the last BTCPay transaction]( was posted in November, more than a month ago (2014-11-07).

The chronology:

 * February 21: Yanukovich fled the country, and was ousted by the Parliament
 * February 26-27: armed people seized the Parliament of Crimea, most likely Russian soldiers or mercenaries
 * March 1: a peaceful meeting organized by the Party of Regions in Donetsk was hijacked by Gubarev and his supporters
Thus, before February 21 Euromaidan supporters were (sometimes) called rebels. But after the Euromaidan have won, this changes: now people who opposed Euromaidan could be called rebels.
But Ukrainian and Russian media uses different terminology. Both Maidan and Anti-Maidan people were called activists and protesters.
Gubarev supporters were called separatists. Russian media invented an euphemism for that: "supporters of federalization".
When armed confrontations started in April, Russian media also started using the term ополчение, which means something like 'local militia' and has positive connotations. I guess western media translated this as 'rebels'.

If hashrate is split between several alt-coins they become susceptible to this kind of attacks. So, essentially, you can have only one big, secure alt-coin for each kind of mining device (GPU, CPU, ...) 


No. Attack I described is possible only if hashrate sufficient to perform it is available on the market, and if it is available, there is no cost: attack is strictly profitable. (You need some capital to perform it, though.)
Bitcoin (SHA-256) hashrate is not available on the market in sufficient quantities, so attacking Bitcoin in this way is impossible. You can't 51%-attack the Bitcoin network because ASIC mining devices required to do that simply do not exist now, and Bitcoin miners will be reluctant to rent you their devices as they know that attack of this nature will decrease value of these devices.


You need about $1k worth of hashing power to do the attack, you have to match hashrate of a honest network.


This worries me too. If rewards are 1/10 of what we have now, it is just less secure, which is probably OK.
However, it is possible Bitcoin will experience a dramatic drop in hashrate during reward halving, as mining will become unprofitable for most miners. In that case Bitcoin might become dangerously non-secure. I'm afraid changes in consensus rules will be necessary to address this problem.

The purpose of Bitcoin mining is to provide security against double-spends: rewriting blockchain history is hard and expensive.
Security relies on two assumptions:
1. It is impossible for one entity to get more than half of total hashpower
2. Attack is not profitable, i.e. costs outweigh potential gains
These assumptions are more-or-less valid for Bitcoin, but not for alt-coins:
1. Each alt-coin uses only a fraction of total available hashpower, thus attacker can overpower honest miners.
2. Attack costs are related to block rewards, value of block rewards is considerably smaller for alt-coins, hence only small amounts of money can be sent securely

You need to isolate your production server from "many developers". Developers write code which is then reviewed by few trusted developers before it is applied to production servers. And, obviously, you need trusted people in charge of running servers.


If you can't trust your server-side code, you should do checks on client side. That's the only way to do it.
@_date: 2014-11-20 13:41:28




A security analysis and cost/benefit analysis are subject to different criteria.
When you're trying to prove that sidechains are secure, a claim that the attack on a sidechain is not possible because it will make bitcoin less valuable is a very weak argument.
However, when you're studying feasibility of sidechain implementation, it's not a weak argument.
By the way, an assumption that mining equipment is worth more than 10,000 BTC is also questionable. Let's say one can mine 100,000 BTC over useful lifetime of the equipment, but that doesn't mean that equipment is worth 100,000 BTC: miners' operating income will be much smaller than their revenues due to electricity costs. Thus net present value of a cash stream one expects to get from mining might be less than amount locked in the sidechain.


Sidechains give miners an incentive to collude. Without sidechains miners do not have this incentive: even if 70% of the Bitcoin miners collude, it will still be extremely hard to steal anything on scale of 10,000 BTC.


Whether grabbing coins from a sidechain is a theft is debatable. From miners' perspective, there is a Bitcoin output which can be unlocked using PoW, so is it criminal to use PoW to unlock it?
E.g. Peter Todd offered a reward for finding a SHA1 collision: 
On the other hand, to earn money on double-spending you'll have to interact with a merchant or an exchange, and at that point a criminal intent will be obvious.


So... sidechain security depends on law enforcement?
Jeez, can't you just admit that it is a centralized system in disguise of a decentralized one.
A sidechain will be secure if and only if a majority of the mining power _agrees_ to secure it. Thus is depends on a _collusion_ among miners to be secure.


Bitcoin is much more game-theoretically sound, as rational miners will follow the protocol under fairly broad assumptions.
But to get a game-theoretic proof of sidechain security, you need to introduce things like psychology and law-enforcement into your model, which suggest that sidechains are deeply troubled in this sense.
A PoW/PoS hybrid might be much better in this respect, so I don't think it makes sense to rush a PoW-only implementation.

Yes. 
A client will obtain a chain of block headers and will validate it by checking whether blocks meet difficulty targets, etc. Usually it will store latest N headers, and will keep it in sync by getting new headers from server(s).
So even if a client connects to a single server, it can check whether what server gives it now is consistent with what it got before. So even if the server is hijacked by attackers, it won't be able to fool your client.
Connecting to several servers is even better, of course.

Some clients work with special servers rather than with Bitcoin nodes directly. E.g. Electrum can connect to an electrum-server and call `get_merkle` for a transaction in question. The server will return a proof that transaction is a part of a block. The client then checks whether that block is in the longest chain.
Clients which work with the Bitcoin network directly are a bit more complex: they first need to set up a bloom filter corresponding to addresses they are interested in. And then they request a blocks in merkleblock format, and that merkleblock message will have transactions they are interested in.

The formula is in the links I've posted above...
Let's say you have an NDF-style contract for 1 bitcoin, settled in bitcoin. If bitcoin price drops to 50% of the original price, one who's on the short side of it will get 1 bitcoin from the one who's on the long side.
So suppose Alice and Bob enter such a contract for 1 bitcoin when the price is $500. Each of them will provide 1 bitcoin as a collateral. (I.e. both will put 1 bitcoin into a multisig 'escrow'.)
 
Now suppose price drops to $250, this means Alice should pay Bob 1 bitcoin. If it is lower than $250 she should pay more than 1 bitcoin to Bob... But she only provided 1 bitcoin as a collateral.
If you want to cover bigger price movement, you need bigger collateral. Perhaps, Alice will put 2 bitcoins, while Bob will only put one... But this hardly makes sense for Alice.

No, it isn't based on Open Assets. However, these libraries are largely protocol-agnostic, so if somebody wants to, he can add Open Assets support.
As to "why not" it is a long story... Gotta explain the history first.
Colored coins standardization effort started in 2012. I wrote the first proposal, and wrote client implementation.
Then in 2013 we were hit by changes in Bitcoin protocol policies, anti-dust rules specifically. Clearly the first proposal (now called OBC, order-based coloring) wasn't a way to go, so we tried to design something better, but it was a really painful process.
So a NGCCC (next-gen colored coins client) project was designed to be able to work with many different 'color kernels', so that we'll be able to choose one in future, or do updates as needed.
Fast forward to January 2014, NGCCC is already more-or-less ready, but we still haven't decided on "color kernel". Vitalik Buterin was in charge of writing the specification, but then he was bored by lengthy discussions and went off to work on Ethereum.
It was a pressing issue. I described many different ways to implement a color kernel in the colored coins mailing list, asking for a discussion. And eventually I settled on EPOBC as it satisfied all my requirements.
Flavien Charlon (the creator of CoinPrism and Open Assets) didn't like it, and proceed to create Open Assets.
So, why don't we switch to Open Assets? I don't like it, it doesn't satisfy some of my requirements:
1. Uses issuing address approach, i.e. issuer can add more at any time. (Unless he have lost the private key.) I prefer a different approach where colored coins are issued in finite batches. (I wrote many pages of text explaining why...)
2. Relies on OP_RETURN, which isn't a big problem by itself, but in practice it imposes a tight limit on number of colored outputs. Which won't allow us to implement things like transaction aggregation and compaction.
So we went with epobc as the default kernel. But Open Assets isn't bad, might be better for some applications, perhaps we'll add it at some point.
@_date: 2014-10-29 00:31:48
In what sense is OpenAssets more flexible?
The topic of "transaction-based coloring" vs "address-based coloring" was being discussed since 2012. And security drawbacks of address-based coloring are well known.
Flavien have chosen to ignore these concerns and go with address-based coloring as the only option. I guess his rationale is "you have to trust the issuer anyway".
This ignores the fact that it is desirable to eliminate as many risks as possible. And it ignores the fact that there is a fairly broad class of applications in which colored coins get detached from the original issuer.
This class includes coins which represent ownership of physical items, and thus must be unique.


I think protocols should be chosen according to their merits, not according to the number of [DICK]( assets which are issued using them.

Let's consider an example: Suppose there is a great competition among miners, and they sell 80% of coins they mine to cover electricity costs. 20% goes to profits/hardware costs.
Then comes block reward halving... If Bitcoin price stays the same, miners will have to shut down their devices, as they mining revenue doesn't even cover electricity costs.
Rapid drop in hashrate can make Bitcoin non-secure: it will be more profitable to mine for double-spending than to mine normally.
But this rapid drop in hashrate won't happen if Bitcoin price goes up 2x.
So this is bad because we either have huge price volatility, or we have dropping hashrate, or both. Bitcoin can't be stable until block reward subsidy's role will become insignificant.

OK, supposed you're a company which want to implement this features. There are two options:

2. Use NDF or other derivatives.
Let's now compare these two options:
1. Well understood, low cost, absolutely minimal counterparty risk (banks are heavily regulated), no other risks.
2. You need to rely on a 3rd party who is willing to engage in high-risk Bitcoin derivative trading, thus counterparty risks will be very significant. Besides that, most likely there will be a mismatch between what your counterparty provides and what you need to provide to your customers, which adds a financial risk.

I'm afraid you misunderstood tone of my post, I'm not blaming Bitcoin core developers for being too conservative or anything like that.
Frankly, I'm not sure implementing this 2-way-peg is justified now. From what I see, side-chain security largely relies on miners not being dicks rather than on economic incentives.
What's about alternatives?
If you rely on people not being dicks anyway, isn't it possible to implement 2-way pegging using threshold signatures?
E.g. entities willing to organize a private chain will create an address which is controlled by threshold signature. This address will be used to hold bitcoins, which re-appear as tokens in a private chain, and are brought back to bitcoin block-chain on demand.
As far as I can tell, the only difference is that the list of entities who are responsible for securing the money is explicit here, while in case with Adam's side-chains it is implicit: essentially operators of large Bitcoin mining pools will be in control of side-chain security.
Thus you can get the same thing (feature-wise) without any modifications to Bitcoin protocol.

Well, I guess people get wrong mental image. Perhaps you can show him that all changes to "the code" are logged here: 
and they are reviewed by multiple people. Then, Bitcoin Core developers take security seriously, so binaries are built using deterministic build process and then are verified by multiple people. This means that sneaking some malicious code into binaries is pretty much impossible.


Something like: find x such that `f(x) &lt; y`. It isn't important, as miners _cannot_ steal anyone's coins.
The important part is ECDSA. It is hard to explain why it is secure, perhaps just mention that it is regarded as an industry standard, and is subject to cryptoanalytics research. If researchers will find that it might become insecure in future, they will recommend upgrade to something else.
@_date: 2014-12-12 20:01:12
It's not possible to fix this bug on the protocol level as it is consensus-critical, i.e. it would require a hard-fork. (Upgrade all clients.)
However, AFAIU, this is only a problem only if client signs a (semantically) malformed transactions. It only affects clients which can sign transactions produced by somebody else, i.e. some kind of off-line or multi-sig clients. 
Because normally clients sign transactions they make themselves, and they won't be this broken.
So if you're making a client with advanced features you should be extra careful and check transactions before you sign them.

Perhaps an easier attack vector would be to do something Google doesn't offer. E.g. a search engine which would work with structured data.
A specific niche which might work pretty well is product search. E.g. "I want an Android phone with screen size between 4.5 and 5 inches, at least 2 GB of RAM, at least 3000 mAh battery."

My opinion is that people shouldn't spawn an alt-coin for each potential use and currency. It makes much more sense to have just one blockchain which is able to work with multiple currencies.
If there are innovations on blockchain level, it might make sense to use a distinct ASIC-friendly algorithm.
However, we shouldn't spawn another blockchain for every minor innovation. ASICs will be produced only if there is a significant reward value, so if innovation is spread among a hundred of cryptocurrencies, it isn't going to happen.

So... if your password is stolen and is then used to transfer your money elsewhere, would bank compensate you?
I don't think it's going to work with Bitcoin, as a bank has no way to recoup losses (Bitcoin payments are irreversible) and it won't be able to tell whether you faked your money being stolen.
If theft of this kind will happen en masse, insurance risk premiums will be through the roof.
The only real solution is trusted hardware.


It's more like a bank wouldn't want to offer Bitcoin-denominated accounts.


It hardly adds any security (you can get same benefit from multi-sig wallets like BitGo, Bitalo, GreenAddress which aren't banks and do not hold your money), and it adds a risk: bank can easily go belly up.
Sure, it's not a problem in US, as FDIC does a stellar job. However, here in Ukraine it is a real problem. For example, bank I'm using only allows me to withdraw $30 at time, as they are out of money.
And the fact that FDIC does a stellar job now doesn't mean that it will continue to do so, especially if Bitcoin will be used as a currency (they won't be able to print more bitcoins).

Loans is one thing, securing funds is another.
In the digital era, "securing funds" boils down to authentication and authorization: i.e. bank checks that the user is who he says he is, then checks whether he authorizes payment, then performs payment on his behalf.
Bitcoin has a native payment authorization method: public-key cryptography. User who owns a private key is the one who is able to spend the money. Thus Bitcoin users do not need banks.


Sure. It looks like you think that bank can cast its bank magic and make things secure.
But there is no magic. To make it more secure, you need better authn and authz. Period. 
Do you know why banks are considered secure now? Because they 1) know their customers; 2) can rollback transactions. Suppose Mallory have stolen Bob's online banking password, and send money to herself. Bob's and Mallory's banks can investigate it and roll back a transaction. And then Mallory will be punished by law.
So banks can use relatively primitive authentication methods (password) and rely on the fact that stealing from bank accounts is hard.
But if you want to rely on lack of privacy and transaction rollbacks, you'll end up with exactly the same system as before.
If we want an improvement in this area, we need to use better authn methods.
Which, usually, boils down to this:
 
 * multi-factor authentication
 * trusted wallet devices
So what is bank's role in this?

I was talking about enforcing a rule which makes p2pool **mandatory**. If somebody violates the rule, he will produce rejected blocks. This is not different from making invalid Bitcoin blocks.
However, the problem is that there is no strong global consensus over what constitutes a valid p2pool block, so we would use prioritization rather than a strict rule.


If p2pool is mandatory, then _normally_ there are **no** other pools. Those other pools are either obsolete, or are attackers.
You're discussing selfish mining strategy, while I explicitly said that "p2pool soft fork" is a different thing.

Colored coins are based on a different approach, so they have different way. For example, it is possible to have a lightweight wallet (which doesn't need to download the whole blockchain) which doesn't need to trust external servers.
(Mastercoin and Counterparty web wallets have to trust 3rd party servers.)
Another difference is that in colored coins trade negotiation doesn't need to go through the blockchain, which means that trade can be fast (no need to wait until offer is confirmed).
Also, colored coins are directly compatible with many Bitcoin contracts, so we can implement things like dispute mediation, escrow, instant payments (backed by 3rd party service), instant trade and so on.

I don't see how this is related to Bitcoin. 
The process which is described in the article (simplified):
1. bank give a loan (mortgage)
2. bundles loans into securities
3. sells securities to investors
4. when it turns out that the loans were of a bad quality, investors take a hit
This process is largely currency-agnostic. If Bitcoin was the world's currency, banks would sell those securities for bitcoins. They might even issue and sell those securities using some kind of "Bitcoin 2.0" platform (e.g. colored coins).
Bitcoin does not prevent fraud. There are so many examples of it. From pirate who ran classic Ponzi scheme. To NEO&amp;BEE who sold their shares and seemed very legit (with tons of publicity) until it turned out that CEO have stolen all the bitcoins.

1. Can you elaborate on the nature of this attack? In general terms, somebody who controls only a small fraction of all coins needs to be unrealistically lucky to get in control of the entropy.

3. Blocks are generated by many different stakeholders, censorship is not possible unless many of them will collude.

\4. Much better to use OP_RETURN, as such outputs are prune-able, and won't clutter the blockchain forever.
Even better is to build a service which would collect multiple such messages, hash all of them into a Merkle tree, and put the root hash of that tree into the blockchain.
This way you can timestamp arbitrary number of messages using only 32 bytes in the blockchain.

Wrong. 80% of citizens of Russian Federation support Putin and his policies, even as his policies are bad for them in a very visible way. E.g. 
 * Russian ruble lost 43% of its value (against USD) after Putin started the war
 * he banned food imports from EU (and EU makes some tasty things)
Then people who know a bit about economics might dislike [outflow of capital]( or the fact that Russia's central bank spent $4B to support ruble the last week, and it's still falling. Or the fact that they money which is supposed to go into pension funds to finance state budget deficit. Or the fact that money which was allocated to be used in mainland Russia is now used to finance Crimea development.
Ukrainians from the Donbass region (which I was living in until May this year) are not smarter. On the first day protests started in Donetsk (March 1) I understood that consequences will be catastrophic and started to prepare to more to other city/country. But something like 30-50% of population supported the protests in one war or another (they were brainwashed by Russian propaganda).
And, as you can imagine, I was right. Very few enterprises still work in rebel-controlled regions, as they were destroyed, looted, or can't work due to problems with logistics. People who got salaries from government or pensions no longer get them. Pretty much everyone who was well off left the region.
So, yes, the majority of people are stupid and irrational, and also very susceptible to propaganda.

First of all, this is not different from going to bitstamp and exchanging your bitcoins for dollars. It just shows differently in the user interface.
Second, this was exactly the business model of NEOBEE, they wanted to provide euro deposits backed by Bitcoin...
All in all, you're going to hold USD in an entity which isn't a bank, isn't properly regulated and it all depends on some mysterious hedging technology. Saying that this is suspicious as fuck is an understatement.
If you want to be taken seriously, you need to explain how exactly this hedging works and what protections users have.
Otherwise, it is just a NEOBEE 2.0 or even MTGOX 2.0 in the making.

This is what happens when transaction processing code is written by a moron.
In this case the moron is Mark Karpeles. It is entirely predictable. Here's what Mark writes about himself on his [twitter account](


I will translate this for you: "I want to do cool things, but I'm very impatient, so I use PHP, which gives me instant gratification".
Mark isn't a moron, I'm sure he is a smart guy, but trust me, you absolutely do not want a person who calls himself MagicalTux and writes in PHP to touch financial software you use. (EDIT: To clarify, the problem is that [Mark is obsessed with proving that 'PHP can do anything']( it is a normal practice to use only well-tested software in production environment, but Mark is eager to use his own quick hacks instead, apparently to prove that it is possible.)
It might look like it works, but people like this do not do it the right way and have no attention for detail. When they see a problem they create a workaround and retry instead of fixing the root cause. (Also this method allows them to deliver software faster than competitors who do it correctly.)
And when you have serious problems in code which handles finances, you can be sure that shit will hit the fan, you only need to wait.
Here's what Mike Hearn (if you won't know Mike, he is the person who wrote BitcoinJ, the first alternative to Satoshi's Bitcoin software) [wrote about mtgox problem](






([More info about the tech side of the problem](
So, basically, Mark didn't bother to hire competent programmers, did everything himself, didn't have enough skill to do it correctly, fucked up, now his software got into the state where it cannot produce correct transactions.
What mtgox does now is more-or-less right, they need to stop withdrawals and to reset the state. However, there is no guarantee that it will work without fixes if there is an attack underway or something like that.
Now the thing is, it isn't the first time MTGOX shows technical ineptitude. Pretty much everything they do shows it. For example, their trading engine was so slow not because of problems with hardware or high load, but because it was written by morons.
Mark and his buddies are greedy, incompetent assholes, that's their nature. But people who kept using MTGOX despite all the warning deserve their fair share of blame for the situation.
Imagine there is an architect who doesn't build houses up to the code, so sometimes they fall down. New house he have built already has cracks in it, but he says they'll fix it. Would you want to live there?
Fucking no way.
It is same with software: if you see serious, systematic problems, it means that people are incompetent, and incompetent people simply cannot produce safe, working software. So if you see signs of incompetence, avoid product at all cost. Do not give douchebags who cut corners your money.
Sadly, a lot of Bitcoin companies are like that... Sometimes it is hard to avoid them.
Say, Coinbase, it's unlikely they are as bad as Mark and MTGOX, but there are signs that they have serious problems. Say, they use MongoDB, a database which isn't designed for online transaction processing. Then you have reports like [this](




I know that people have to use Coinbase to purchase bitcoins and keep them in 2FA wallet, but I wouldn't trust them my money until they hire a different team and do a full rewrite. (Maybe they aren't as incompetent as MTGOX, but it looks like they are too hip to write financial software.)
I think it should be mandatory for new companies to disclose what software stack they use, what security measures they implement, who implemented it and so on. Of course, they have a right to not disclose the details, but we have a right to avoid companies which do that. There are now dozens of exchange and wallet startups, only the sanest and most competent of them deserve to be in this business.

A Bitcoin-like blockchain needs a Bitcoin-like currency to provide an incentive for miners to do proof-of-work.

Bare-bones colored coins are boring like that, but many interesting features can be built on top of them. Say, real-time trustless exchange.
Colored coins protocol is much closer to Bitcoin protocol and is thus compatible with many of [distributed contracts]( That's not the case with Counterparty, which has more built-in features instead.
But I'd say colored coins aren't really better until such features are implemented.
You can get a taste of it via ChromaWallet: ChromaWallet's p2ptrade transactions are directly between peers, and they take like 5 seconds to execute (compare to 30 minutes for Counterparty decentralized exchange).

Well, in my opinion, we shouldn't use Bitcoin blockchain for tiny transactions. It is overkill. You don't really need trustless, 100% decentralized transaction processing network to buy coffee.
It would make a lot of sense if we'll make a secondary payment network for tiny transactions, while Bitcoin will be used for settlements within that network, and for larger transactions, savings etc.
This would also solve a problem with confirmations.
On the other hand, if we insist on using Bitcoin blockchain for tiny payments, we'll have to increase block size limit, which would increase requirements for Bitcoin nodes, thus making Bitcoin less decentralized.

We can assume that tokens are worthless before the initial distribution is complete, so if issuer fails to distribute them as he intended, it will be failure at start and no real damage will be done.
I think same can be said about crowdsale using vennd. Not receiving a token at all is hardly better than receiving a worthless token. So vennd is OK.
Relying on vennd for trading after crowdsale is complete is a different thing. (That's what I was talking about.) At that point tokens have value, so attack on the trading server can do a lot of damage.

Not every PHP programmer is a moron... but many are. So if you have an open source project written in PHP, chances are you'll get some morons into the team.


The problem is that compared to other languages, it is full of pitfalls.
In other languages, you can just get a 'web framework' and it would provide you a good environment for writing web apps, taking care of many things right out of box.
But PHP is itself a web framework, you can implement web apps using the bare language, as all the necessary constructs are built-in. But it is a very shitty and rudimentary one.
So you would want to use another one (Zend, Symfony), which makes things better, but:
1. they work on top of the built-in stuff, and thus can be affected by problems in it
2. built-in stuff is not disabled, you can just `echo` in middle of your Zend or Symfony app
Thus it takes a lot of efforts to not shot oneself in the foot.
On the other hand, a language like Python is by itself web-agnostic. Web request processing is implemented in libraries/frameworks, which can implement it in a way which makes sense, without any cruft.
Is it possible to write good software in PHP?
Yes. But even the most high-profile projects like Wordpress are of a bad quality (tons of vulnerabilities, bad plugin model, etc). So it's very rare, and there is definitely a problem with the language itself.

10 years ago I was one of the main programmers in a team which implemented a PHP-based web app, which was quite successful and was in use for 5+ years.  My wife and my best friend are PHP programmers. I taught PHP to my wife.


It doesn't matter that something is possible. When you're starting a project, you should look at what is typical. And you see that even high-profile projects like Wordpress had lots and lots vulnerabilities, and have problems with the architecture. So making a good PHP-based forum is just not feasible.
You cannot depend on your programmers being ninja jedi gurus who know PHP inside-out and make no mistakes. You can't hire such people. You can try to hire people who are above-average, but that's not enough.
To be fair, an average, typical PHP programmers can deliver a web app. But chances are it will have a number of quality problems.

Should we agree to add all kinds of useless features as long as somebody agrees to pay for them?
I don't think we should whore the Bitcoin protocol. Any extra logic will make it more fragile, and hard/soft forks are painful. (Obviously, hard forks are much more painful...)
So my opinion is that new features should be added to the protocol only after extensive research which demonstrates that it is a best way to introduce such a feature. Sidechain proposal haven't yet passed this test.

Let's consider two scenarios:
1. Bitcoin-only: Buyer needs bitcoins to buy tickets. In this case no 3rd party involvement is necessary, event organizer only needs to install a piece of software which does it. In fact it is already possible through ChromaWallet, but UX is very bad. But it's something which can be improved, and even technologically-unsavvy event organizers will be able to use it.
2. Legacy: Tickets are bought using fiat money, through centralized outlets. Event organizer sends tickets he have issued to an outlet, outlet sells them (distributing colored coins to buyers), and eventually sends money to the organizer. How is it better than Ticketmaster? Well, an outlet does just one thing (processes fiat payments, which we can't avoid in this scenario), and it should be easy to change them. So I expect that to become a commodity service.
Third parties aren't inherently bad, they just shouldn't be allowed to become monopolists (at which point they can start abusing their position).
E.g. in Bitcoin world we have Coinbase and Circle doing roughly the same thing. If Coinbase will start charging high fees, Circle will simply eat its market share

He is a billionaire if you use methodology used for lists like Forbes: they use information about assets one owns and their current market price.
Particularly, Mircea owns more than 800M shares of MPOE, current market price is about 0.0008, which means that his stake is "worth" 640k BTC, which are about $600M.
Less that 20% of MPOE shares is traded on market, so, obviously, Mircea won't be able to liquidate his shares for $600M. (Note that if Bill Gates liquidates his Microsoft stake, he won't get his "net worth" in dollars either.)
Also it is safe to say that Mircea owns more than 100k bitcoins, as [in March of 2013 he was able to pay off 27k BTC MPOE loss]( and the table says he provided 68k BTC capital. He wasn't particularly upset about 27k BTC loss.

You're right, but we know what is working and what isn't... Letting users to use wallet however they want is one thing, asking them to perform certain steps is another.
Also scale matters... Doing it with assets worth millions of dollars and thousands of users is, obviously, scary.
But if you only have a couple of dozens of users (investors), even if something goes horribly wrong, it's possible to fix it manually.
Finally, if somebody loses $100 worth of assets due to a bug in software, I can simply compensate him out of my own pocket/dev budget: we pay more than that for testing alone. But, obviously, I can't do that on bigger scale.

Yes, only their coins will be stolen. However, bitcoin users might be affected indirectly.


No. Every such increase in the option set has costs, and it is only good when benefits outweigh costs.
I don't think that adding support for a fundamentally flawed protocol has any benefits, thus whatever costs are there (extra complexity) makes it not worth it.
But a bigger concern is that sidechains will effectively block implementation of a better protocol: people will think that the problem is already solved, and other solutions (which might require hard or soft fork) will be unwelcome.


It's cool and everything, but the Bitcoin protocol is already fairly complex and has a number of quirks, so adding extra stuff to it is not free.

People say: "What the fuck? Clearly making scripts Turing-complete was a bad idea". And Ethereum is abandoned  as a broken project...

Colored coins isn't a specific kind of a coin, but more like a toolkit. Incorporating features into the protocol is unnecessary, it is up to applications to implement those features.
It is true that development is somewhat lagging (perhaps because there isn't a huge incentive to develop an open source toolkit, it is hard to monetize a thing like that), but, I'm afraid you're dismissing it a bit too early.

Also, there is hope that it improves in future.
And Sunny King claims that major Peercoin stakeholders will never resort to double-spending attacks, as they fear to crush value of their stake. I really doubt that this argument is game-theoretically sound, but if you accept it, then Peercoin is pretty secure.

Yes, when somebody starts using the protocol, societal trust gets replaced by the consensus mechanism inherent to the protocol.
But a new actor first needs to refer to 'societal trust' to get the up-to-date version of the protocol. You're ignoring this part.


I'm not confusing them, I'm saying that if you consider the whole picture, you need both.
Gavin Andersen [wrote]( that he is going to (encourage users to) override PoW consensus in the case of 51% attack, hence PoW consensus isn't a king.
PoW is useful when things are normal, but in exceptional situations social consensus kicks in.
Same thing for a hypothetical PoS-coin: societal consensus prevents complete-rewrite attack, but is not used in normal day-to-day operations.

It's worth noting that problems started before uprising: Yanukovich canceled talks with EU because Russia offered a loan, a loan which was desperately needed
Yanukovich's government lost 50% of central bank's foreign reserves in 2-3 years and was at a point where they can no longer control exchange rate.
Russia's loan could prolong the agony, but it was clear that it isn't going anywhere, as there was no economic growth for 2 years and taking more loans only makes debt bigger.
New government implements austerity measures while making exchange rate flexible (which, in theory, reduces pressure on reserves and fixes trade balance issues).

I think we should start warning newbies about mining... Most companies who offer mining hardware delay shipments:
1. BASIC-MINING: failed, refunded
2. AVALON: shipped first batch faster than competitors, batch 2 and 3 were delayed, chip shipments were horribly delayed, by the time people got chips they were obsolete
3. BFL: severe delays...
4. KnC: shipped more-or-less in time, delay is small
5. ASICMINER: ships in time, but hardware is overpriced
6. HasfFast: severe delays...
7. CoinTerra: delayed...
Difficulty is rising rapidly, even 1 week delay has significant effect on the bottom line, 1 month delay basically kills it...
Cloud hashing is even worse, they exploit the fact that people will pay extra for starting right now, so it is horribly overpriced... Loss is guaranteed. They don't even need to do any mining: they can just get your dollars, buy bitcoins, and send a fraction of those bitcoins back to you.
In fact there were people who did just that: [TAT.VIRTUALMINE]( and [Deprived Mining Speculation]( In both cases people who bought mining contracts lost and operator (or people shorting these contracts) won, which is understandable: operator is an experienced, knowledgeable person, most investors are newbies who believe that market prices are fair....
So back to the question, the problem is that newbies aren't analyzing it properly as an investment, they believe that they're buying money-making machine. Some people think that they are helping the network... Yeah, sure, joining the largest mining pool definitely helps.
And companies which offer mining hardware and contracts take advantage of these people. I think we need to do something about it, like put a big fat warning, start a meme, I dunno... "Bitcoin mining is a fool's errand" or something like that.
People who can do proper analysis and are willing to accept the risk will get through the warning, but perhaps we can save some poor souls who do not understand what they buy.

Cost of mining is approximately equal to value of mined bitcoins. Period. 
Cost of mining can't be higher than value of mined bitcoins, as in that case miners will be better off turning off their miners.
However, if cost of mining is much less than value of bitcoins which are being mined, people will buy more mining hardware, as it is profitable.
Hence cost is bounded from both sides.

It's still work in progress, I hope we'll make a more accessible version once we finish. General ideas:
1. Blocks which can potentially be generated are numbered, stakeholder which should be used to generate block B_i is known in advance.
2. If we see two different versions of block B_i, that means that stakeholder who was supposed to generate this block cheated (only he controls corresponding private key), and so his stake is seized. Thus we can punish misconducting stakeholders.
3. Stakeholders are chosen via a lottery of sorts, and it is important to prevent "cheating". 1) 4. Particularly, reasonable amounts of computational power should give no advantages in lottery. 2) "Cheating" can only be possible in case of widescale collusion or extreme luck.
4. We solve this problem by getting a small amount of entropy from each block and combining it in a special way which makes cheating hard-to-impossible.
5. Two-round protocol makes cheating even harder.


As far as I know, it is just a clone of PPCoin, so same criticism applies. And in addition to that, short period of PoW mining likely means that the majority of coins are concentrated in hands of few. So it is not very decentralized.

We should differentiate between:
 * Bitcoin node software, which establishes consensus over the blockchain
 * Bitcoin client software, aka wallet software, which offers functionality to end users
Client software relies on node software, but is otherwise independent of it.  You do not need to be a core developer to implement a wallet with extra features. Examples of such  features include:
 * multi-signature wallets
 * deterministic wallets
 * stealth addresses
The Bitcoin protocol isn't perfect, but it's good enough. We now need wallet software which implements useful features based on the core protocol.
That's what startups are doing. E.g. BitGo implemented a multi-signature wallet.


Eh, which ones?

Actually, it is "as long as nobody sends money to your old addresses".
Suppose I will send you 0.001 BTC once per week. Quite likely your wallet will use this coins to make transactions, so you will sign multiple transactions with same privkey.
It is understandable that people _should_ follow best practices. But the problem is that HD wallets might be vulnerable to this kind of an attack _even if_ user follows best practices, unless there are additional precautions on the wallet level, like "do not spend unsolicited coins".
And 'dumb' deterministic wallets are immune to this kind of an attack.

It depends on how do you confirm transactions. If you use a private server (like Open Transactions), it will be slower than NYSE, but still pretty damn fast: it shouldn't take more than a fraction of second to confirm a transaction, and I'd say it's enough for good liquidity.
But blockchain-based technology is much more problematic in this respect, it's simply not designed for second-level latency.

Well, you see, right now a collusion between mining pools is very unlikely to happen as it's hard to do something nefarious without miners noticing it. There are essentially two potential sources of profit:
1. double-spending
2. ignoring blocks of other miners
Neither is realistic.
However, to attack a side-chain, miners need to covertly build an SPV-proof(s) which would withdraw coins from a side-chain, and it is like "you do this work and get the money".
So the problem with sidechains is that they create an incentive for miners to collude.

There is no block subsidy which produces new coins, but blocks are produced in a same way as they are with normal merged-mining, and it can be vulnerable to 51% attacks in the same way.


This is another option (which is very different from merged mining), but as far as I know, it isn't being considered.
There is, indeed, a way to use Bitcoin blockchain as a trustless time stamping system, and it indeed could make side-chain as secure as Bitcoin itself. [See here]( But it isn't compatible with SPV (at least a primitive form of it).

Yes, currently dogecoin is in a better position, but in a situation like this I'd say neither is secure until one will start dominating.
Also it's worth noting that hashrare distribution changes as price and difficulty fluctuates, also it depends on block reward. In other words, it is too early to make any conclusions.


Well, if we assume that miners are rational (i.e. profit-motivated) and are not particularly loyal to one of cryptocurrencies, it doesn't matter much, as a pool which offer bigger rewards will be more popular than p2pool (a rational miner will prefer middlecoin-like pool to p2pool).
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:46:23


The bug in the pegging mechanism is that anybody who owns enough hashpower can effortlessly steal the coins. It is flawed by design.


Not really, miners can flip at any time.
 E.g. imagine a side chain generates 10 BTC per day in tx fees, while the total amount of bitcoins in there is 10,000 BTC.
So miners have two options:
1. mine for 1000 days to get 10,000 BTC in mining revenues from this sidechain
2. attack the chain and get 10,000 BTC
I don't see why they would prefer option 1.
So the problem is that sidechains create a huge incentive to collude.
That's not the case with vanilla Bitcoin: there is no pot of gold colluding miners can win. They might try to exploit double-spending, but it's much harder to pull off than attack on sidechain.

Debit/credit card security depends on trust and policies. Stealing credit card numbers isn't that hard (it's literally printed on the face on the card and needs to be presented to every merchant you buy from), so they are trying to make it hard to steal money once a credit card number is stolen.

Ripple Labs shipped an entirely different thing, though: bitcoins existing within Ripple are issued by gateways who hold the actual bitcoins. So it couldn't have prevented the MtGox fiasco.
So, with Ripple, you have essentially the same risk as with MtGox, but slower transactions. I think it's no wonder Ripple hasn't replaced centralized exchanges ~2 years after the initial release.
As to who shipped first, I actually released ArmoryX capable of p2ptrade in January 2013. It was just a proof-of-concept in terms of quality, but nevertheless, it was capable of doing trustless exchange transactions on the Bitcoin mainnet.

You wish to reverse a transaction which already got enough confirmations. To do that, you create a transactions which double-spends it and pays bribes to stakeholders who created blocks.
Suppose this transactions is published in such a way that greedy stakeholders can find it. They will be happy to create a chain of blocks which includes this transaction instead of the original transaction, as in that case they will collect bribes in addition to their PoS block reward.

The whole point of using blockchain and cryptography is to allow name resolution which is not based on trust, right? Otherwise we could just use DNS.
This is especially important in name-&gt;bitcoin_address resolution. If you trust a server, and somebody hijacks that server, he can replace address with his own, and people will start sending him money.
So the thing is, you need whole blockchain to resolve a name _independently_, i.e. within a thin wallet.
And, yes, namecoind scans the whole blockchain to build this local DB.
What's interesting, it is actually rather simple to change Namecoin protocol to enable fast looks (which would mean that browser extensions and mobile wallets will be able to resolve names without relying on servers), but people who do not understand the difference are hyping existing implementation, so there is no pressure to fix it.

A year ago we decided that colored coins is the name of a concept, rather than a specific protocol. Thus, many different protocols can exist.
It isn't necessarily a bad thing. Different protocols have different traits, and it is up to "the market" to decide which is the optimal one.
I expect that eventually one protocol will dominate, but we also can end up with different protocols being used for different things. It isn't a problem to implement several protocols in one wallet application.

I don't think you understand how p2ptrade works. It is not centralized. It is based on atomic transaction.
E.g. consider a transaction with two inputs and two outputs: Alice's gold coin goes to Bob, Bob's silver coin goes to Alice. Either both Alice and Bob receive a payment, or none of them does. Thus neither Alice needs to trust Bob, nor Bob needs to trust Alice. And they don't need a trusted third party either.
Atomic trade transaction is what makes p2ptrade possible, as it makes it safe to trade with strangers and use untrusted communication channels.

Sidechain does not exist on the Bitcoin protocol level: all you have is a bunch of inputs which can be unlocked using SPV proofs.
You can create a single fake block which moves all the coins out of the sidechain, build block headers on top of it, and then use same PoW to construct as many SPV proofs as you need.
As for the contest period, as an attacker, you need to be sure that honest miners won't be able to contest you with the hashrate they have.

Of course, it would be better if protocol used immutable txids to refer to transactions, but it doesn't (and, who knows, maybe that would create a different kind of problems), so clients have to deal with it.

There is no such thing as a "Counterparty".
There is a number of different versions of `counterpartyd` program which work by scanning the Bitcoin blockchain for messages encoded in a certain format, and using those messages for updating state database.
So one of those `counterpartyd`s implemented Ethereum in the following way: if a message is marked as an Ethereum message, it is fed to the Ethereum library.
At that point you have `counterpartyd` which implements two things:
 * old Counterparty protocol
 * Ethereum
And in that Ethereum you can run this "340 lines of code" implementation of Counterparty protocol. At that point you might as well remove support for the old protocol. (Not sure it makes sense: perhaps native encoding is more efficient.)
You're confused because Counterparty might mean several different things:
1. the concrete protocol (i.e. defining both message format and semantics)
2. protocol's semantics
3. a program to scan the blockchain and execute messages
4. project/organization
5. XCP
When we say "Counterparty implements Ethereum" we mean 3, but when we say "Ethereum implements Counterparty" we mean 2.
So no, you don't have an infinite loop.

Nope, absolute size of mining community doesn't matter. What matters is coin's share of total hashrate for  a certain kind of a mining devices/algorithm.
In simple words, we can have one secure coin for each kind of mining devices, e.g. we have Bitcoin for SHA-256 ASICs, Litecoin for scrypt, Primecoin (?) for CPUs.
If there are two or more coins which use same mining devices, then one with smaller hashrate can be attacked.
It absolutely doesn't matter if you have 1000 miners or 1000000 miners.

A colored coin is a Bitcoin transaction output. To verify an incoming payment, we do a normal Bitcoin SPV, and then check the color of the transaction output by fetching transactions which link it to the genesis transaction.
Thus it requires more data than Bitcoin SPV, but not the complete blockchain.

You don't need a full node if you use a mining pool... But blocks are constructed by that pool, not by you, you're just providing hashing power to that pool.

Having 51% of hashpower makes it theoretically feasible. Sure, it takes about 50 
weeks to rewrite 1 week of blocks, but it is possible.
It is another question whether it is practically feasible. It is a matter of scale.
This doesn't matter much, what matters is that somebody who has 51% can ignore blocks produced by others and start mining empty blocks. This is a realistic attack if your goal is to show that Bitcoin is vulnerable...

Making a custom Bitcoin wallet is not something what an ordinary developer can do. It is **hard**. 
You know, just like an ordinary developer shouldn't create his own compiler, programming language, browser, database, etc. These things are hard to get right and it's better to use existing software.
Many exchanges are OK running bitcoind and implementing high-level wallet on top of it.
If you absolutely need a custom client, you need to hire somebody who knows the protocol inside out. And you'll be better off if you open source the effort: even if your developer is good, he might overlook something.

No. If GHash.io (28%), Discus Fish (14%) and BTC Guild (14%) pools adopt a side-chain,  it will get 56% of all Bitcoin hashpower, and thus will be nearly immune to attacks. (Especially if Eliguius joins too.)
The problem is... Suppose there is a wildly successful side chain which has 1 million BTC in it. At some point GHash.io drops out, claims it has problems with software or something like that... It's not a problem, since you have, say, 30% of all Bitcoin hashpower, that's a lot of pethashes, right?
Well... Month later it will turn out that GHash.io and some other pool were actually doing a 51% attack which gives them 10000 BTC, or maybe 100000 BTC, or the whole 1 million BTC. Note that it is goes directly to pool operator, and it is more than they would get from mining over the lifetime of the project, so it is profitable.

Yes, you need a mechanism to filter out spam attacks, so what?
Counterparty uses Bitcoin for such mechanism, that's an easy path. But it's also terribly inefficient.
Instead of using Bitcoin blockchain for publishing offers, you can make a separate (PoW, PoS or centralized, up to your taste) blockchain for offers. Benefits?
Faster and cheaper trade. Potentially, orders of magnitude faster and cheaper (e.g. 5 seconds vs 30 minutes).

Mining pools are constantly being monitored. People will notice drop in global hashrate, the fact that several pools have "bad luck"... And they can even notice that they are mining a private chain as this information is revealed.
On the other hand, merged-mining can be done in private, only root hash is revealed, and it says nothing.
And drop in hashrate will not be noticed. Suppose GHash.io announces that it isn't going to merged-mine a side-chain XYZ. It might be because they plan attack on XYZ. (And are, in fact, mining it in private.) Or that might be because they have problems with XYZ software. There are legitimate reasons to NOT merged mine, and thus people will not suspect an attack.
Obviously, GHash.io cannot declare that it doesn't mine Bitcoin, lol.

They still haven't figured out how to make sidechains secure. [The paper]( lacks security analysis. Section 6.1 lists ideas on making it secure, including:
 * Subsidy. A sidechain could also issue its own separate native currency as reward, effectively forming an altcoin. 
This is the only of their ideas which actually makes sense and doesn't result in centralization. So, yeah, the only way to make sidechain secure and decentralized is to make an altcoin.

Bitcoin protocol establishes consensus under assumption that all nodes can receive the longest chain. (I.e. after node is aware of the blocks of the main chain, it will ignore forks.)
However, you cannot assume that when you use Bitcoin network.
Consider the situation where your nodes connects only to malicious nodes which are controlled by the attacker: that will give attacker an ability to double-spend, or even fake transactions (if you rely on SPV).
If you use radio, then attack needs to be performed in real space, which is presumably harder than fiddling with some bits. 
(E.g. somebody who controls a router you're using can easily pwn Bitcoin protocol security by letting you to connect only to their fake nodes.)

In case with colored coins, we associate value with transaction outputs, and thus it works similarly to Bitcoin.  Mastercoin/Counterparty associate balances with addresses, which is very different.
Another difference is that in case with colored coins, p2ptrade is a separate protocol  which uses properties of the base protocol to do trustless trades. On the other hand, Mastercoin/Counterparty have trade as a part of the core protocol.
This separate protocol, p2ptrade, is much more flexible, and can be used for fast trades.

That money which "doesn't really exist" is backed by loans.


Let's consider a scenario where everybody wants to convert their dollar savings to bitcoins.
So, Alice has $10,000 in her bank account, and wants to buy bitcoins. She transfers her USD to and buys bitcoins. As a result of it, $10,000 will be present on exchange's account. If it was Bob who sold bitcoins, in the end Bob will end up having $10,000 in his account.
It is important to highlight that **buying and selling bitcoins does not change quantity of USD in the system**. USD simply go from one bank account to another, they do not evaporate. Thus, people it won't lead to people discovering that their money "doesn't really exist".


Why are US dollars valuable at all? Because there is a demand for US dollars. Particularly, there are USD-denominated liabilities worth trillions dollars.
In simple words, USD are pretty damn useful for paying off your mortgage if your bank demands debt to be paid off in USD.
Thus USD won't become worthless overnight, a lot of people (and companies) will _need_ to buy them to pay off their debts.

Bitcoin isn't an authentication mechanism.
As I mentioned above, Bitcoin blockchain can be useful to implement transferable tokens as it can prevent double-sending of these tokens. But this has nothing to do with mining hardware.
@_date: 2015-05-06 08:55:04
Wrong. If miners/full nodes disagree about what block size limit should be, you'll have a blockchain fork, i.e. a consensus problem.
So if there is a limit, it should be a part of consensus critical code, because it is consensus critical.
If you make it a "soft limit", i.e. each miner decides how big his block should be, and other nodes/miners **have** to accept it, then you can end up a situation that miners (mining pools) who have powerful machines will deliberately make large blocks to kill the competition.
E.g. suppose you remove a hard limit and let miners to decide. Then let's say the biggest mining pool will say like "We want Bitcoin to be available to everyone on Earth, so we reduce require fee to 1 satoshi per transaction!". Then some time later they start generated 1 GB blocks (which they can fill themselves). Other mining pools can't keep up with this and close. All miners flock to this huge-ass mining pool... Which is the point.
It gets even worse when block subsidy goes to zero. Suppose  that fee is 100 satoshi per kilobyte and mining is done by a dozen of large-scale operations. Suppose one of them secures $100M in funding and reduces fee to 1 satoshi per kilobyte. They can afford it because that have $100M to burn. But other mining operations can't, they are losing money now, so eventually they'll have to sell their hardware. (Even if you aren't mining, keeping hardware in datacenters costs money). Now that big-ass operation buys all the hardware and becomes a monopolists. Jacks fees to 1000 satoshi per kilobyte. (Or whatever is optimal for them.)
So how about we analyze things before jumping to conclusions?
@_date: 2015-05-20 14:02:13
Currently miners get both block subsidy (e.g. 25 BTC) and transaction fees. The subsidy is gradually reduced, so eventually miners will only get fees.
As you have correctly noticed, the opportunity cost of an attack are fees miner's revenues. And so in the long term, Bitcoin network will be secured by fees miners collect.
And those fees are roughly proportional to Bitcoin's usefulness, i.e. demand for making transactions.
And thus it can be said that "colored coins and approaches like NASDAQ's" are increasing Bitcoin security. E.g. NASDAQ will pay some transaction fees, and those transaction fees go to miners, who will be able to do more hashing.
But they also increase incentives for attackers, so it is a double-edged sword.

"Selfish miner" attack works only within a certain game-theoretic model, so it's more like a thought experiment, not a practical attack.
In theory, other miners might cooperate with a selfish miner to maximize their revenues. 
In practice, nobody will give a fuck enough to implement modifications to node software, they will just continue mining as usual. As a result, orphan rate will be higher for everyone, but the "selfish miner" asshole will lose more than others.

If you want to generate a chain of `l` consecutive blocks (i.e. B_i...B_i+l-1) and you control only 1/M of the coins, you need to perform `M^l` computations. For `l=30` and `M=100` that would be 100^30. So it is computationally unfeasible.
Even attacker who owns a half of all coins will have a problem with this for sufficiently high `l`, e.g. for `l=128` he needs to go through 2^128 combinations.
Generating a chain with gaps requires fewer computations, but I doubt it will give you much.

But in case with bitcoins, if they are gone, they are gone. :) Bitcoin escrow provider might claim that bitcoins somehow mysteriously disappeared.

Here's the theory behind it:
If your goal is to verify transactions and identify transactions sent to your addresses, you only need block headers and UTXO set (list of all unspent transaction outputs). You still need to download the whole blockchain, but you only need to store the a small part of it.
If your goal is to help the network, you need to keep the whole blockchain... Well, it's unlikely that your laptop is going to help. You need some sort of a server. 25 GB is nothing even for a home server.
And the third possible goal is research and analysis. You might need full blockchain, possibly in indexed form. Well, this is definitely not for low-end laptops. But high-end ones should be able to cope with that.
Let's go back to your statement:


This is not true, there are no risks.
The only problem is that developers and researchers who happen to use shitty laptops experience inconveniences, but it's hardly a significant problem.


Utter bullshit. Just as an example, I'm from Ukraine, Eastern Europe. In most places you can get at least 20 Mbit/sec unlimited plan, it would take 3 hours to download the whole blockchain, and it's hardly an issue.

My guess is that auctions are perceived as something bad: a greedy organizer takes extra money from ticket buyers.
They claim it is a fair market value, but it's a market which is fully controlled by Ticketmaster, so it's hardly free and fair.
Our proposal is to embrace secondary markets. Once you have secondary market with low fees and high transparency, you can claim that it is a free market, and it would legitimize auctions.
That's the theory. We can try to make auctions more appealing, and perhaps it's something which would grow over time,

Technically it is exactly the same (and I mentioned this link in the article), and it, indeed, can already be accomplished.
The difference is intended usage: one FrozenCoin can be used to authenticate user to multiple services, and it can be used in decentralized applications.
Sadly, making them requires trust, we need to be sure that at least one party have destroyed his private key. But you could combine N semi-trusted oracles, and if at least one of them have destroyed its private key after signing, coin will be unspendable.

Why would you continue mining when electricity costs more than what you get from sale of bitcoins?
In that case it makes more sense to buy bitcoins than to pay for electricity.


It will be like that for 1-2 years, I think hashrate will stop growing at time of the next reward halving.
It will be like that:
1. Difficulty keeps climbing until miners' start spending 70-80% of mining revenue on electricity.
2. At that point people will stop investing in mining equipment, difficulty will stop growing.
3. After halving they will have to spend 140-160% of mining revenue on electricity, so they just turn it off.

I think a possible alternative is a collusion between several smaller pools... Normally miners would avoid colluding pools, but I think collusion of 5 pools is better than domination of 2.
But it would be funny it would end up inferior to Ripple. Basically what sucks about Ripple is initial distribution of XRP, but otherwise it can have transactions verified by dozens or even hundreds of independent entities rather than by a couple of pools.
Also alt-coins like Litecoin (GPU mining, [pool hashrate distribution]( seems to be healthier now) and Peercoin (proof-of-stake, anybody who owns peercoins creates blocks once in a while) are now worth considering...

When you click 'send' in UI, client constructs transaction automatically: it selects what inputs to use, creates outputs (including change output), signs transaction and submits it to the network.
You can do these steps manually, that's what raw transactions are about. Also, when you do it manually, you can create two transactions having same inputs (double-spend), or do something unusual.

1. Regular payments: when you regularly buy from a same vendor (e.g. you buy a cup of coffee every morning), you can save on transaction fees if you use micropayment channels . (Also there is no need to wait for confirmations after channel is set up.) Colored coins can enable people to pay in USD to avoid problems with exchange rate volatility.
2. Payment system: A more complex system with intermediary makes it even better: User pays to intermediary using a micropayment channel, intermediary pays to merchant. This system requires only a minimal amount of trust (in the worse case intermediary will eat the last payment) and can further reduce transaction fees. (As multiple payments are effectively aggregated into a bigger one.)
3. Actual micropayments, like paying for visiting a web page, tips and so on.
4. Stock trading: Something similar to micropayment channels can be used to do stock trading with minimal amount of trust and minimal overhead.
Colored coins protocol inherit many traits and feature of Bitcoin protocol (being only a thin layer on top of it), micropayment channels is one of features which works as is.
Counterparty is significantly different from Bitcoin as it is account-based rather than output-based. So we can use the same approach. Perhaps a different approach would work?
I believe it is impossible, as Counterparty lacks an ability to send asset to multiple destinations in one atomic transaction. This is necessary because we want to deliver payment to recipient and return change to sender at the same time.
Besides that, it looks like Currently Counterparty doesn't even support multi-signature addresses, which are definitely a prerequisite to micropayment channels and many other advances features.

Ehm, actually you're right, and "nonsense" link above is nonsense, not relevant in this context.
@_date: 2017-02-05 18:08:40


Wrong. Most Core devs are OK with block sizes up to 4 MB.


Most Core devs believe that a hard fork is an extreme measure, so they try to avoid it as long as possible. Hard forking Bitcoin to support 4 MB blocks is kinda silly. So they invented a way to increase block size in a backward-compatible way. Block size is increased to 4 MB, but for compatibility reasons non-witness part should remain at 1 MB for now.


@_date: 2017-02-05 18:34:28
OK, I'll try:
 Core
1. Hard forks should be avoided for as long as possible (maybe forever?). It makes no sense to do a hard fork just for a 4x increase.
2. Unrestricted growth of block size will make Bitcoin centralized as it benefits bigger miners.
3. Unrestricted growth of block size will make Bitcoin centralized as many people won't be able to run full nodes.
4. Miners shouldn't be in control of Bitcoin and shouldn't be able to increase block size as they wish, since their incentives are often at odds with concerns mentioned above. (I.e. big miners won't mind becoming monopolists.)
4. 4 MB block size is more-or-less OK, though.
5. High fees isn't a big deal, it's more important to keep Bitcoin decentralized.
6. Second layer solutions (such as Lightning network) are the proper way of addressing scalability/reducing fees.
 Unlimited
1. It's important to make transaction fees low, as they affect adoption.
2. The right solution to reduce fees is to increase block size: because it is needed RIGHT NOW, and only "on chain scaling" is compatible with all existing wallets, etc.
3. Block size limit should be determined by "free market".
4. Miners should be in control of block size limit. They are interested in long-term success of Bitcoin, and so they will do what is best.
 tl;dr:
 Core is paranoid and focuses on security/decentralization, no matter what costs are. Unlimited focuses on economics (particularly of laissez-faire kind) without thinking much about security/decentralization.


That can happen only if they sustain hashrate above 50% of total SHA256 hashrate.
A fork will foremost affect payments. It won't directly affect holders.
But no-one knows for sure. If a clear winner is established quickly it might be over in matter of days (or even hours). With no clear winner we might end up with a clusterfuck situations for a long time.


No one knows, but I'm going to 'diversify' if things start looking like a fork is possible.

You _always_ need to wait for confirmations. That's how Bitcoin works.
It is true that here on Earth double-spending is fairly hard, so merchants can accept zero-confirmation payments.
But you shouldn't depend on it. If miners were rational, they would accept a double-spending tx with higher fee (replace-by-fee policy) without violating Bitcoin protocol, so if you discuss the theory, you should never assume that accepting zero-conf payments is secure.
@_date: 2014-11-26 01:33:09
I think the idea is that PoS will normally produce "one single consistent fork", and subjectivity is needed only to avoid a theoretical problem of "somebody bought the old private keys and changed the whole history".
I think in practice it would be enough to add a checkpoint, say, once per year. If you introduce a rule that, say, devs can only checkpoint a block which is 6 months ago, it doesn't give any tangible control over consensus.
If devs violate this rule and checkpoint a recent block to cause a fork, then devs are malicious, and this is not different from PoW cryptocurrency devs being malicious.
Thus it introduces **no** plausible attack vectors, and solve the theoretical problem with a complete rewrite. So, why not?

When you receive a payment, payer creates a transaction with one of outputs going to your address. So you end up with many outputs (coins) no matter whether you use one address for everybody or one address per user/payment.
Number of addresses you use does not matter, what matters is number of payments you receive.
About 170 bytes are required to spend a coin, so effectively you need to pay 0.000017 BTC in fees. You should take that into account.
Network doesn't ever combine anything automatically, the only way to reduce number of outputs is to spend them.
(Perhaps this would help you to visualize this: when you receive a payment, your address is written on top of a coin. If you give same address to many people, you'll have many coins with same address written on top of them, but that doesn't help.)


Yes, but transaction fees are _per kilobyte_, and you need certain amount of bytes to spend an output, so your costs will be around 0.000017 BTC per payment you received no matter what you do. Different addresses or not, it works in exactly the same way.
You can pay smaller fee and wait until, perhaps, a miner which accepts lower fees will mine it.
But if you ask me, 0.000017 BTC per payment received isn't a lot...

We have a constant stream of good news for quite a while. Pretty much everybody who wanted to buy have already bought. So it stopped reacting to good news.
Price might go up when more people will join Bitcoin markets, e.g.:
1. new reasons to buy (products/services which work exclusively with Bitcoin)
2. buying will be more accessible
Bitcoin companies might help, but it takes considerable time.
I hoped that NEO/BEE will have significant impact on price as it will make Bitcoin much more accessible and useful to people on Cyprus, but somehow it didn't work.
On the other hand, don't forget that 3600+ BTC are being mined each day, and some of them are sold. So, basically, we need something on scale of  $1M/day just to keep the price stable.
If less than $30M are invested into Bitcoin, price falls.

ChromaWallet has standard SPV security, but it needs to do extra work. Basically, it needs two things:

Because that's how Bitcoin protocol works. If accepting a block is a matter of opinion, you will no longer have a global consensus as opinions can differ, and global consensus is the whole point of using PoW/blockchain.


I neither see how this could work, not I see the point.
Suppose I connect my node to the network after a week of inactivity. Should I pay to download 1000 large blocks, or should they pay me to process them? Who pays whom?
Bandwidth isn't an issue. in theory, you can balance inbound/outbound traffic. The issue is that processing and storing large blocks is expensive, and not processing them isn't an option if you want to stay in sync with the rest of the network.

An ETF might simply offer conversion between real bitcoins and its shares. I.e. you give it real bitcoins, it gives you shares. And vice versa.
In that case we can expect that price of these shares will closely track price of real bitcoins due to arbitrage. E.g. suppose shares are cheaper than real bitcoins. Then arbitrager will buy shares, convert them to bitcoins and sell them on bitcoin exchange.
I'm  not sure that's how this specific ETF works, but in general, something like this can work pretty well.

Security guarantees of the Bitcoin consensus algorithm depends on an assumption that a node is able to get blocks of the valid chain. When you analyze it, it might be easier to assume that you see all blocks and are able to select the best chain out of them, and that best chain is likely the one you want.
Bitcoin consensus algorithm is good, but it relies on good networking.
In my perspective, Bitcoin protocol is the whole logic of a Bitcoin node, including both consensus algorithm and network protocols and behaviors.
Networking protocols and behaviors which are currently present in Bitcoin Core do not offer any strong guarantees, and thus Bitcoin protocol as a whole doesn't offer them either.
So yes, Bitcoin consensus algorithms are OK (in context of this discussion), but network protocols can be improved.
tl; dr: I don't think that Bitcoin network protocol isn't a part of Bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2017-02-26 11:30:52
Doesn't this create a huge risk of a actual blockchain fork?
E.g. suppose only 40% of miners run SegWit-enforcing nodes when it's activated.
In an ideal situation blocks produced by non-segwit miners will have no segwit transactions, thus they can happily co-exist with segwit miners.
But it can also turn bad. A non-segwit miner can mine a segwit transaction without a proper witness. (This can happen either due to misconfiguration or due to a malicious intent). 60% of hashpower will consider that block valid and will happily build on top of that.
Segwit-enabled nodes (including miners) will reject those blocks. So now you have two chains...
All it takes is just one rogue miner... There is a good reason for a hashpower activation threshold.
Another thing to consider is that if we remove signalling then devs will be able to dictate protocol changes. Node signalling is unreliable, miner signalling is something you do not want, so what's left? Just devs.
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:11:57
getblocktemplate essentially fixes the problem and is better than p2pool in some aspects (for example, it is suitable both for large-scale and small-scale miners). Eligius provides this option, so Eligius is OK.

Attacker will be able to confirm fake transactions having only a minority of total hashpower. If we assume that cost of making a block equals its reward (i.e miners operate on zero margin), it will cost about 150 BTC to produce 6 blocks. So an attacker having access to 25% of total hashpower will be able to produce 6 blocks in ~4 hours, and it will cost him 150 BTC.
If transactions he's trying to double spend are worth more than 150 BTC, he can profit from this.
Same is true if profit margins are positive.
If they are negative, attacker will need to spend more than 150 BTC, but it's far more like that he'll be able to rent the needed hashpower 
E.g. imagine that after a reward halving or a price drop a significant fraction of miners, say, 50% will drop out, and difficulty will adjust accordingly. These miners might turn on their devices again for a premium. So here's a complete attack scenario:
1. Make sure that the victim (e.g. an exchange) can connect only to your nodes.
2. 500 BTC send-to-self on the main network, victim shouldn't see this transaction.
3. Once it's confirmed on the main network, send 500 BTC to victim.
4. Pay 200 BTC to miners to turn on their equipment and mine 6 blocks on your fork.
5. In ~1 hour you will have 6 blocks (because total haspower of former miners matches total hashpower of the active ones).
6. Your payment is now confirmed, can convert it to alt-coins or get goods.
So with a network-level attack (e.g. hacking ISP's routers) and 700 BTC in capital you can get 300 BTC profit.
Note that this scenario is trivially preventable with "If I can't connect to a known-to-be-good node then do not confirm payments" logic.

That might be true, but I don't think one **has** to pick sides on a personal level.
As a Bitcoin holder, you will maximize profit if everyone chooses Bitcoin. But saying it openly doesn't make it so. On contrary...
I've got my stash of bitcoins in 2012, and it's still the dominant part of my cryptocurrency portfolio. But every time a Bitcoin maximalist utters some stupid shit, I convert some of my bitcoins to alt-coins.
Personally, I don't want to pick sides because I don't have a fucking crystal ball.


It's a zero-sum game only if you use a simplistic model which doesn't take into account evolution over time, spread of awareness, R&amp;D etc. The sector is still growing as a whole, so, _by definition_, it's not zero-sum. It's possible for two cryptocurrencies  to grow at the same time.
I agree that Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum compete with each other, but calling it "a zero sum game" isn't correct.


Mostly in areas which Bitcoin cannot reach, by design.


This isn't true at all, it is different in a number of ways.


It has, but Ethereum devs are willing to take risks of switching to PoS and implementing sharding.
So, basically, Bitcoin is very conservative and aims to do only one thing, but doing it right and without fuck ups.
Ethereum is the opposite, it is a continuous experiment which aims to do all the things, including what Bitcoin does.


On a single chain it won't. (Although, in principle, Ethereum might be considered more scalable as it have adopted GHOST and embraced "fast sync" model.)
Ethereum devs plan to solve it using sharding, state channels and things like that. This isn't guaranteed to work, so there is a risk, but usually with a risk there is a reward.


Yes, but that doesn't mean it's good to alienate people involved in Ethereum. If you do that, it only make _you_ look bad.


Existence of criticism doesn't imply that the idea should be abandoned.
Vitalik knew that the project is very ambitious, and thus will face many challenges. It will take a lot of time to do it right. They are prepared for that.
Currently it works more-or-less as expected. It will probably go through several crises before getting closer to the original vision, but they are unlikely to kill Ethereum. So, why give up?
But anyway, one interesting thing about Ethereum community is that they try to be as inclusive as possible, e.g. they try to cooperate with "private blockchain" and other alt-coin projects. This might seem counter-productive, those projects do not use ETH token. But as a long-term strategy it might eventually pay off. E.g. a person who worked on Ethereum-based "bankchain" might eventually join an Ethereum startup.
I don't think "other coins are scam" strategy works in 2017. I'm pretty certain there is a way to emphasize Bitcoin's strong points without shitting on competitors.

Wallet has a notion of unspent coins. Once wallet have created a transaction, it will mark coin as spent and won't use it again.

We need block size limit which is below the processing capacity of a typical node. 
If the limit is above it, then it is possible to drive nodes (and miners) off the network by mining blocks which exceed their capacity.
In other words, limit which is _too high_ can be used to attack nodes/miners. Lack of limit works that way too, it's equivalent to infinity.

If many nodes are run by the same entity (Nodeshares), it is NOT GOOD.
As Satoshi described in his paper, SPV clients can be vulnerable to Sybil attack: SPV clients connect to several nodes to find the longest chains, but if they are all controlled by an attacker (e.g. by Nodeshares), it's possible to trick them into following the wrong chain.
Bitcoin network can benefit from more full nodes, but only if they are fully independent.

Bitcoin Unlimited marketing campaign?
They boasted they have $100M to kill a small block chain, it's conceivable they can spend a couple of millions on "marketing". With that kind of budget outs easy to outbid everyone for block space.
They already have 25% of hashrate, and they can easily add several more Chinese pools to get to 50%, at which point a fork can happen.
Obscene fees can be used as a casus belli. Like, "we have to act to save the network"
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:19:23
It's much easier for a miner to signal BU readiness (costs nothing, maybe even some bonus from Ver) than to participate in a minority hard fork (almost certain loss).
So they won't be able to recruit any significant hashpower for a minority fork.
So it will be a suicide for the movement: people will simply laugh at them if they show, say, 2% of Bitcoin's hashrate. Also, it would be painfully obvious that it is an alt-coin.
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:45:26
In theory, sidechains can rely on proof-of-work which is done either via merged-mining or directly. But both are bad, for different reasons:
 * without merged-mining, hashpower will be fragmented between multiple chains. e.g. imagine there are chains A, B, C, D, each having 25% of total hashpower. This means that miners of B and C can unite and wreck chain A.
 * with merged-mining, a miner can decide to attack chain A while still getting rewards on chain B
In principle, merged-mining can secure any amount of blockchains, but the security will be at mercy of large mining pools. If those mining pools are honest, you get, basically, unbreakable security.
But there are incentives for them to stay honest. E.g. imagine a side chain generates 10 BTC per day in tx fees, while the total amount of bitcoins in there is 10,000 BTC.
So miners have two options:
1. mine for 1000 days to get 10,000 BTC in mining revenues from this sidechain
2. attack the chain and get 10,000 BTC
I don't see why they would prefer option 1.
Note that an argument that miners won't attack because that would make coins worthless doesn't work here: miners will only wreck a sidechain, Bitcoin will be fine.

Bitcoin script is based on Forth, a stack-based programming language. Bitcoin script interpreter executes instructions one by one, manipulating state and stack.
It is not Turing-complete because it lacks looping construct. Suppose we add looping... Now what?
Interpreter is vulnerable only if there is a bug in interpreter. Interpreter of a more complex language is more likely to have bugs in it, but that doesn't mean it _will_ have bugs. Difference is quantitative rather than qualitative.

Absolutely. It is pretty much impossible to lose money in cold wallet. 
I'm sure they know how much they have in cold wallet and how much people have in accounts.
If they see that cold wallet has 600,000 BTC, hot wallet has 50,000 BTC and sum of account balances is 700,000 BTC, this means that 50,000 BTC were lost.
At that point they need to shut down everything and do the investigation.
No matter how incompetent they are, it's impossible to not notice that 700k BTC were lost. Programs can have bugs, sure, but the whole point of cold wallet is to rely on human judgement. It's deliberately not automatic.
The "leaked" document looks like something which was fabricated to manipulate the price. Although I won't be surprised if Karpeles (or somebody else; yakuza?) have stolen all bitcoins.

If you can monitor all major pool, monitoring hashrate can be effective.
And requirement of many confirmations makes sense too: it helps against attacks which have  less than a half of total hashrate, and it also gives some time to notice the attack.


This might work until people make multi-algorithm software.
But note that it might result in drop of hashrate if miners will be lazy to upgrade.

Actually, I do. I'm one of co-authors of the [proof-of-activity paper](
 &gt; We propose a new protocol for a cryptocurrency, that builds upon the Bitcoin protocol by combining
its Proof of Work component with a Proof of Stake type of system. Our Proof of Activity (PoA) protocol
offers good security against possibly practical future attacks on Bitcoin, and has a relatively low penalty
in terms of network communication and storage space.


Cool. Please explain how it works in this example:
 imagine a side chain which generates 10 BTC per day in tx fees, while the total amount of bitcoins sitting there is 10,000 BTC.
Miners have two options:
1. mine for 1000 days to get 10,000 BTC in mining revenues from this sidechain
2. attack the chain and get 10,000 BTC
Isn't it rational to choose 2? Why not?


Which analysis?
I think problems with sidechains security are obvious, I've just posted a simple example which helps to illustrate it.


Yep, this was the motivation for PoA research.
BTW we might have a problem sooner than that, take a look at [this](

The thing is, it is trivial to copy 'the core', but it is impossible to copy the community.
There is now a hundred of so-called alt-coins which have exactly the same core. Whatever awesome feature Bitcoin has, they have that too, because they are based on the same source code with very few modifications.
So it is time to admit that it is really about community and infrastructure, not about technology... Technology is simply a substrate.
Bitcoin could have been cloned from day one, in fact we had a testnet which has same rules as Bitcoin. People could have created Bitcoin-1, Bitcoin-2 and so on.
But everybody implicitly agreed to use Bitcoin, not testnet, not Bitcoin-1 etc. And that created a community.

1. People who have a large stake are interested in long-term viability of a coin, as it's impossible to liquidate a large stake quickly without a significant loss. So we can assume that they will take the interest of minority into account.
2. If there are multiple competing coins, small-scale holders can easily switch to another coin if they don't like something.
3. It's quite simple to fork off abusing members: basically you reinitialize the system with same balances but without their coins. PoW forks usually suffer from "summoning sickness", i.e. security is weak before specialized mining devices are developed and sold to public. PoS coins don't have summoning sickness, a freshly forked PoS coin might be as strong as it gets. So forking PoS is much easier.
4. There is no perfect solution, but if we compare PoW and PoS w.r.t. incentives we see that PoS has much better long-term incentives. (PoW margins can be arbitrarily low, and the value of mining equipment can be arbitrarily low (when it's near the end of useful life when margins are low), thus there are situation where PoW miners simple don't give a fuck.)

Yes, you can look at the source. How do you know which source is right?


Yes, but that doesn't matter in practice.
Note that correct bootstrapping of a PoW node requires connecting to at least one honest node from which legitimate miners are reachable. It is impossible to implement this check in code, as there is notion of "honest node" and "miners". You just cannot know if your node is correctly bootstrapped without "asking someone you trust".


You don't need a hardware backdoor to compromise Bitcoin. It can be compromised through:
1. Corrupt client. E.g. somebody thinks that Bitcoin Unlimited is Bitcoin and downloads that.

They _can_ still mine old blocks just fine. But they also _can_ fork you off.


No, you need a supermajority of miners to _enforce_ SegWit.
Otherwise it takes just one miner including just one illegal segwit transaction to fork the chain.


Without a supermajority of miners we can end up with two chains.

1. BU algorithms severely weaken the consensus. They have to rely on active involvement, communication and negotiation between miners. So BU, by itself, is insufficient for Bitcoin consensus to work.
2. It will allow the majority of miners to dictate conditions to other miners.
3. It will allow the majority of miners to dictate requirements for nodes. In other words, big miners will decide how much capacity your node needs to have.
4. If you do not update your node configuration according to big miners' wishes, you might face reorganization much bigger than is possible now. In other words, confirmation times will become a lot bigger, i.e. you'll need hours for payment to clear.

What is Bitcoin?
It isn't a particular piece of software -- software changes. It isn't a particular protocol -- protocol changes. It's isn't a particular blockchain either...
Bitcoin is defined through societal consensus.

Devices which receive payments do not need to have any private keys on board. Every intelligent device has an owner. Money should go to the owner of devices.
You don't need any satoshi for authentication, you only need public key cryptography.
Using the Bitcoin blockchain for communication is ridiculously stupid.
Blockchain can be useful to implement transferable tokens, but you don't need "few satoshi" in every device to do it: you can structure the protocol in such a way that the interested party pays the fee. Particularly, device vendor can subsidize transaction fee if that's a feature of the device he's selling.
Giving every device an unique private key and, perhaps, some hard-wired auth logic can be useful to implement smart property. But this isn't what 21 is advertising, they are advertising mining chips. Mining is all but irrelevant.

Hi, I lead development of ChromaWallet, the colored coins client.
It is possible to use ChromaWallet on mainnet, but it is not recommended for a number of reasons:
1. Currently, only "order-based coloring" coloring method is supported. It is wasteful in the sense that you need about 10000 satoshi per unit. That is, issuing 10000 units will cost you a full Bitcoin.
2. p2ptrade cannot be trusted (it's a demo!), never use it on mainnet
3. We plan to change how deterministic wallet is implemented.
4. You need Bitcoin-Qt with enabled txindex to use it on mainnet.
5. Only full blockchain scan method is supported now, and it is slow as fuck on mainnnet.
6. And there is a number of small issues which might be relevant or not depending on what you're doing.
If this doesn't bother you, you can use it at your own risk. :)
Otherwise, we're going to make a better release by the end of January.
Feel free to PM me and describe what you want to achieve, perhaps we'll find some intermediate solution. I'm willing to help.
Currently our focus is on making a client which will have a whole set of features, but if there are people who will be satisfied with a partial set of features (say, OBC and no p2ptrade), we can do that.

No, other language do not have as many pitfalls, and thus do not require exceptional mastery to get to an acceptable software quality.
I explained the main problem with PHP in [another comment in this thread]( PHP has a built-in web framework (of sorts) which is bad and cannot be disabled. And all other frameworks are essentially based on it.
Another problem is [lots and lots of quirks]( which developers need to be aware of to avoid problems with security and quality.


But I don't need to. Good programming languages are designed in such a way that shooting oneself in the foot takes an effort, so ordinary programmers can deliver good code.


Well, mastery of a language like Java or Python won't prepare you to crazy shit like ("9223372036854775807" == "9223372036854775808") is true PHP, or that few space at the end of your source file will be appended to your output.


It's just one of factors. Besides that:
1. it takes a lot of effort to learn all of PHP's quirks and best practices, as there is so many pitfalls

This is especially important for things like smart property and property registry: an association between a token and a property can be independent of issuer, e.g. an unique transaction hash can be embedded into hardware, and after property is transferred, neither issuer nor manufacturer will be able to manipulate its ownership records.
However, with OpenAssets doesn't have an notion of an unique token, so issuer can always create more of this tokens and take over the device. So it is a bad idea to use OpenAssets for smart property.

Bitcoin is designed in such a way that:
 * every node verifies every transaction
 * transactions are stored forever
Compare this to BitTorrent design where peers transfer data directly. BitTorrent's total throughput becomes bigger as the network grows, but in case with Bitcoin performance of a single node becomes a bottleneck.
Thus Bitcoin doesn't scale very well, it won't be able to process a large number of transactions per seconds. Block space is scarce, and putting your transaction into it costs money.
Besides that, in future Bitcoin security will depend on transaction fees. If fees are tiny, Bitcoin won't be secure. That's the fundamental trait of Bitcoin's design.
Developers _could_ reduce fees, but it is simply not sustainable.
If bitcoin transaction fees are too high, it might make sense to use centralized services for small transactions. Bitcoin provides tools which can be used to create centralized services which are reasonably secure (i.e. won't be able to steal all the coins like inputs.io did).

If they see that their users want segwit and threaten to go elsewhere if service doesn't endorse it, businesses will have to make a choice.
If end users just sit on their ass things aren't going to happen. Action is required.

Then I don't see how you're going to secure it... When mining reward is minuscule as compared to value being transferred, (merged-)mining is game-theoretically unsound: a rational miner will prefer facilitating double-spend attacks to honest mining. Especially if value of asset isn't being reduced by such attacks: presumably they will be able to redeem coins they have stolen on side-chains into full bitcoins.

What's interesting, [DCG portfolio]( includes Blockstream. And I'm pretty sure Blockstream have tested SegWit.

Index in what sense?


Eh? .bitcoin alone is 40 GB (without txindex).


I can give you a breakdown. History table:
    47 GB
     address     | character(35) | not null
     txid        | bytea         | not null
     index       | integer       | not null
     prevtxid    | bytea         | 
     outputindex | integer       | 
     value       | bigint        | 
     height      | integer       | not null
Its indices:
      history_address_height_idx    | 20 GB   
      history_txid_index_idx         | 28 GB 
So just this table with its indices is 95 GB, if you add 40 GB required by bitcoind it is 135 GB.
Is this excessive? Well, we could remove some fields, but I'd say that having all inputs and outputs indexed by addresses in just 2x the size of the raw blockchain is a fairly good result.
Anyway, it doesn't matter... Suppose your super-efficient index (which probably won't be enough for block-explorer-like functionality) is just 50 GB. If blockchain is 20 times bigger, it will be 1 TB.
@_date: 2015-05-23 19:47:32
Possible causes:
1. transaction was not propagated properly
2. large time between blocks due to a bad luck (block finding is a statistical process)
3. asshole miners include few transactions (they get 99% of their revenues from block subsidy and thus they barely care about transactions and transaction fees)
4. fee is too low
If we are talking about 3 hours, reason 2 can be ruled out, as 3 hour delay is _extremely_ unlikely.
So about fees, current my bitcoind shows these per-KB fees depending on how soon you want your transaction to get into a block:
* 1: 0.00052 BTC
* 2-5: 0.00044 BTC
* 6: 0.00038 BTC
* 7-9: 0.00027 BTC
* 12: 0.0001 BTC
* 15: 0.000044 BTC
* 20: 0.000014 BTC
* 25: 0.000010 BTC
This means that in practice fees are bigger than what most people think.  E.g. 0.0001 BTC/KB is considered a baseline, but your tx might be unconfirmed for ~2 hours if you use it.
I have no idea what's the default fee in Breadwallet, but I found that February update advertised "lower bitcoin network fees"... So this might be a problem. There is more competition for block space now, so wallets should increase fees, not reduce them.

A better solution is to use a different tx-id: hash which was signed cannot be changed (obviously), so it makes more sense to use it as a tx-id instead of a normal txhash.

One group of people believes that transaction fees can be reduced if we remove some 'unnecessary' restrictions from the protocol and allow miners to decide what is better for Bitcoin.
Other group of people believes that those restrictions are actually necessary to prevent miners from monopolizing Bitcoin (thus making it irrelevant).

Basically financial software often deals with [online transaction processing]( which is basically what traditional, SQL-based database management systems are made for, they guarantee ACID:
 * Atomicity (transaction is processed as a whole, e.g. if transaction moves money from account A to B you cannot get to a situation when only one balance is updated)
 * Isolation (concurrent transaction do not interfere with each other)
 * Consistency (data always satisfies constraints)
 * Durability (data is stored permanently after transaction is committed)
You want all these features because you don't want your database to be in a broken, inconsistent state. And pretty much all SQL DBMSs guarantee this.
MongoDB is not designed for OLTP, it offers no ACID guarantees in traditional sense, it shouldn't be used for financial software. (Unless you can make sure it works correctly, but in that case you won't need an advice.)

No, Bitcoin founded on the assumption that there will be many independent miners, and most of them are rational, i.e. act in their best interest.

You gotta see the big picture.


They have themselves said that they like SegWit, but haven't yet tested it yet. So how about they test it? Is that so fucking hard?

No. Do you expect all technical work to be done by volunteers while CEOs reap rewards?
They should also contribute technically. If anything, by testing.


Yes, and SegWit is an increase. They are OK with SegWit, at least as a short-term solution.


They want SegWit too, besides the increase, because it simplifies work of hardware wallets. SegWit is a significant improvement of the protocol.
So should we block it just because _it is also_ a block size increase?


So what? A lot of Bitcoin users rely on it. _Bitcoin Wallet for Android_'s author also endorses SegWit. Together they are bring Bitcoin to millions of Bitcoin users, allowing them to transaction trustlessly.
Will you say they are less relevant that shitty DCG businesses?
Maybe you should go outside more often and stop masturbating on CEOs.
Bitcoin is bigger than businesses, it's a large ecosystem with millions of users. And pretty much all technical people who make it possible want SegWit, a technical improvement of the protocol.

Universities would be a good choice. They are quite neutral, are spread around the globe, and, likely, can afford to run a node.
Would they want to be involved? Maybe. Universities were among the first adopters of Internet. Many of them are already involved in Bitcoin/cryptocurrency research. E.g. MIT and Cornell are involved in a pretty big way. They probably already run Bitcoin nodes.
On the other hand, universities might start dropping out if the network is associated with some criminal activity, such as money laundering. They might be pushed by governments, or just avoid the controversy.
Otherwise, large public companies like Google, Amazon, eBay etc. will probably want to work with it if it goes big, but the problem with that is that many of them are incorporate in US.

So R3 is building a digital equivalent of that.
It's not as simple as collecting signatures and timestamping them. [Notary]( doesn't just timestamp a document, he also performs some sort of validation and authentication.
Through digitization of contracts Corda can also automatically validate state transitions.
And to make it work automatically you need "proofs". "Proofs" are basically just digital signatures over data which is arranged in a particular way.
Do you understand that a digital signature over a structured data is much more valuable than a signature over a PDF document, as in the former case data can be processed automatically.
Would you say that signatures are useless in general?


You didn't read the article, did you? Hashes should be widely published, e.g. in a newspaper, and after that history revisions are impossible.


You can solve it using a newspaper or a radio broadcast. Bitcoin blockchain is just more convenient, but also less secure (as reorganizations are possible).
The general intuition behind this is that information spread is highly asymmetric: once information is spread, it can't be "unspread" back.

It barely makes any difference. We are talking about an exchange here, don't we?
So suppose you've made a withdrawal with random amount, so we got two outputs like 0.1234 and 0.5678. Attacker can't tell which is change. (Assuming that both were sent to new random addresses, which usually isn't the case.) Good.
Now the next guy withdraws 0.1 BTC, and so we have 0.5678 split into 0.1 and 0.4678. So now we know that 0.5678 was a change, and this we know that 0.1234 was a withdrawal.
So output order randomization is akin to using ROT13 for encryption. Would you say that not implementing ROT13 is a bug?

It is possible to run Linux from a LiveCD. The hardest part is configuring it to boot from CD.
Then, just insert the disk, reboot, it loads Linux, you do whatever you wanted to, reboot again, and you get your Windows back. All this procedure takes no more than 10 minutes.
Annoying? Yes. Impossible? No.
Of course, booting into LiveCD is needed only for working with savings. Pocket money, like $200 worth of bitcoins (or whatever is 'pocket money' for you) can be kept in 2FA-protected online wallet (Coinbase) or mobile wallet.
So, this hardly an issue:
1. Working with savings requires like 10 minutes to reboot etc.
2. Working with pocket money is easy, but there is a small risk that it can be stolen.

_Fan-in fan-out_ isn't a useful pattern. You'll be better off making a transaction with multiple inputs and outputs.
_Fan-out_ is, indeed, a pattern of batch withdraw/payout. So by itself it's not suspicious.
What's suspicious is that fan-out is directly connected to fan-ins. So, assuming that both fan-ins and fan-outs are produced by exchange of some sort, you have an exchange paying to an exchange.
This can happen. But the specific pattern in this particular case is very suspicious. Let's consider two scenarios:
1. Different exchanges: Fan-out is done by exchange A, and fan-in is done by exchange B. I find it very suspicious that a certain point of time the majority of pay-outs on exchange A were sent to exchange B. How would that happen? Especially if B is a cloud mining ponzi scam. Sudden outburst of scam popularity?
2. It's the same exchange, in which case it makes no sense. Why would it send money to itself?
So still, a scenario where both fan-in and fan-out are produced by blockchain spam scripts is far more plausible.
As for fan-in, it only makes sense if you move money to a cold wallet, or take profit. It doesn't make sense to defrag UTXOs of your hot wallet.
_Fan-in fan-out_ pattern can happen if money is taken from cold wallet and is used for payouts. But that's not what we are observing.

Well the alternative explanation is that somebody wasted $10000 to defragment his wallet. suggested that it might be a ponzi cloud mining scam.

Bob and Dave think they found a way to improve the system they are working on, making it more economical. Alice and Claire agree that it will make it economical for some time, but significantly increases a probability of disaster. I.e. a system is cheaper (which is good), but might blow up at any time (bad).
So, Alice and Claire make it clear that they will never agree to this change. No matter how economical it is, engineering ethics do not allow them to approve unsafe changes.
Bob and Dave do not understand why the change is unsafe. They believe that Alice and Claire might have conspired to keep costs artificially high.
So they try to rally users to remove Alice and Claire from the project. Alice and Claire are deeply upset because users might switch to a non-safe system. Also the process of changing the system is very risky by itself, so chances are the disaster will happen if users will try to switch.
Now please explain me what do you think is a right thing for Alice and Claire to do. And what do you think the root of the problem is in this situation. (I'll remind you that in _this_ example, Alice and Claire are right.)

I.e. miners _have_ to run a new version which includes a SF. I'm not sure that's fundamentally different from just switching to a new version.
If there are several incompatible soft forks that just falls apart.


It's not just hand-wavey, it is very dangerous.
It might make sense to do that just once, only because we've reached an impasse. If there is a disagreement between what users want and what miners want, users can force their way, but it requires a lot of effort.
But it cannot work as a general mechanism. There is no magic way to make protocol upgrades easy.
If a change is such that everyone wants it, then miners want it to, and so activation threshold can be used to activate it safely.
If there is some sort of disagreement, then the upgrade can only be implemented through activism.

Small scale investors were bidding below market price: it simply doesn't make sense to bid higher than the market price as it's possible to buy, say, 1000 BTC on exchange like BitStamp.

You can see sum of transaction fees for each block on blockchain.info.
E.g. [this 441 KB block]( got 0.17711638 BTC. If we have same per-transaction fees and blocks become full (1 MB), miners will get around 0.4 BTC per block.
Another example: 176 KB block, 0.05 BTC in fees -&gt; 0.28 BTC for a full block.
Thus if you want fees to play a bigger role, either blocks need to be larger, or per-transaction fees need to be larger.
E.g. if 25 BTC per block is our target and we want to keep paying 0.0001 BTC per KB, we'll need 250MB blocks to get there.

Frankly,  I don't think this is even worth analyzing thoroughly, since asymmetric PoW is much better in every way.
For example, it might be like this: find 3 transactions which when hashed together with your address will yield a hash below the target. This is hard to compute (requires iterating through all transactions^3), but cheap to verify (given the transactions, just compute a hash). Or better yet, find 3 (or more) _transaction outputs_ satisfying the condition above. Then pruned nodes will have a chance to participate, and it will be more memory-heavy than disk-heavy.
Using PoW which isn't **heavily** asymmetric is just ridiculous.
As for refereeing, you gotta consider cases when some nodes just skip the validation (like SPV mining), when attacker tries to DoS the network by spamming many invalid works, when attacker censors accusation notifications and so on. It is both complex and completely unnecessary.

This is what I'm saying: it is all about cost &amp; payoff functions, not capacity.
So Trump's capacity to do a lot of damage is irrelevant when the cost of doing exceeds possible payoff.


I don't think so. At its core, terrorism is just a way to amplify your resources. E.g. suppose it costs $1000 to plant a bomb which makes $1000000 damage. It's simply more effective than a direct confrontation (assuming you opponent cares about the damage).

There some very unusual transactions in blocks during the spike, this looks very artificial.
E.g. in this block: 
You can see many large transactions which collect large number of inputs into a single output with round number of bitcoins (e.g. 25 BTC), and all of them pay 0.1 BTC fee. 
I don't think there is any way to explain that as a normal user activity.
These transactions are also present in later blocks, e.g.:
E.g. in block  there is a [a 43258  byte transaction]( with many inputs and a single 25 BTC output which pays 0.1 BTC fee. 231 satoshi/byte.
In block  there is a [66260 byte transaction]( which collect a lot of inputs into a 25 BTC output and pays 0.1 BTC fee.
In block  there is a [31903 byte transaction]( with one 25 BTC output and 0.1 BTC fee.

He was talking about "company bucks", not about "personal bucks". Obviously, company itself is supposed to accept money it issued, and its customers want it. If company has no customers, its money is worthless.
As for money issued by individuals, people who trust that individual might take it. That's the idea behind the original Ripple.
E.g. suppose Bob and Alice buy a lunch for $20, Bob pays for it. Alice now owes Bob $10, and she says $10 "Alice dollars" to him. Later Alice pays for dinner, and Bob sends her money back, which cancels the debt.

Typically you need 150 bytes for one input, so an input with 10000 satoshi has positive value only if fee rate is below 66 satoshi/byte. 
You can look at fee rate statistics here: 
So we see that fee rate have been above 60 satoshi/byte the whole February. But in January it went to 30 satishi/byte or so.
So there is a chance to recover about a half of your bitcoins. You can set fee rate to 35 s/B or so and exclude outputs smaller than `0.0000525` BTC.
If you feel adventurous you can try even lower rate, like 15 s/B, in that case you might be able to recover 75% of value.

No, it's the same: in both cases your demo is unsuccessful. The only difference is whom you can blame, which is irrelevant when you're planning a demo. 


It's somewhat more unpredictable, especially as most wallets do not support RBF. But you should never rely on transaction getting confirmed in less than one hour.
E.g. there are Bitcoin ATMs which wait for a confirmation. Well, it might take 2 hours regardless of the situation with congestion. Do you think a person should wait there for 2 hours?
It shouldn't be so dependent on luck, you should either accept 0-conf or warn user that it might take a day.

This is bullshit.
Doing the right thing takes time, and people who do a shitty job get market share by being first.
But after fuck ups like this people flock to better platforms, so eventually it will be sorted out, I think.
Of course, Bitcoin exchanges are largely not about code, but about processing USD payments, which is hard. But I hope there will be an exchange which does both things correctly, and they will win the market.

Coping with NASDAQ level of traffic can be a problem even if in a centralized environment... 
And within Bitcoin model, we require every node to validate the whole transaction log, thus adding e.g. NASDAQ transaction to log will require everybody to have systems as powerful of that of NASDAQ.
(But NASDAQ doesn't use a per-order cryptographic signatures now... Adding those signatures will create problems even for NASDAQ itself.)


There is no such thing as "instantly". If one can tolerate 10+ minute latency, then trading on the blockchain is doable (in fact I demonstrated it back in 2013). ~1 second latency is doable with a help of contracts. (Not 100% decentralized blockchain-based, but still mostly trustless.)

It depends on how you calculate it... If you have fixed amount of dollars to invest, investing at $500 will give you twice more bitcoins, which is not negligible.
However, it's unlikely that your strategy is better than strategy of other players, so it is a matter of luck... You cannot know if it will be $500 or $2000 1 month from now as there is no way to predict it with any degree of accuracy: it depends on multiple factors which you cannot control.

The problem with these schemes is that there are no convenient tools.
The problem with day-to-day transactions can be solved by having several wallets, like "pocket money", "warm wallet", "cold wallet".
Anyone who invested in Bitcoin should have several wallet, if anything for security reasons.
There will be zero problem with spam from cold wallet, obviously, so you have just one transaction per year.
For warm and pocket wallets you can choose some other scheme. E.g. print out the seed and give it to relatives.

Merged mining is far from perfect, but it was possible for Namecoin to get ~55% of bitcoins hashrate and for iXcoin to get ~43% of it. Attacking them is far from trivial.
(BTW I described a concept of [side-chains]( which can be used to create coins as secure as Bitcoin itself.)


This is a complex topic, it depends on what kind of attacks you consider and how do you calculate costs.
In theory, attack can be profitable: attacker can sell coins he have mined. If price of coin you're attacking doesn't change during attack/immediately after, you will make same amount of money regardless of whether you're attacking or minining normally. So we can say that marginal cost of attack is near 0, or even negative.
However, price might change as a result of an attack. But it is hard to quantify this effect. (In theory, attacker might get his coins mature and credited on exchange before price moves.)


Well, it is much better than a certainty that coin you created is NOT secure.

First of all, security isn't binary. A cryptosystem can be secure against _particular_ attacks under certain assumptions.
For example, Bitcoin security guarantee is that as long as the network is controlled by honest miners all users which will be able to connect to it will achieve probabilistic consensus over the state of the blockchain.
But if you run a Bitcoin wallet on a trojan-infested machine, obviously it won't be secure.
So back to Guardtime, first of all, their main offer is a timestamping server. You can use it to implement tamper-proof logging, audit trail, digital signature schemes etc.
They offer a tamper-proof server hardware, and additionally you can real time monitoring to detect discrepancies.
Nothing is 100% unbreakable, but this thing is probably good enough to make hacking it practically unfeasible.
Is it better than Bitcoin? It depends on assumptions you make. On the one hand, Bitcoin doesn't depend on a particular piece of hardware, it's massively decentralized, so "hacking" Bitcoin is impractical. But, on the other hand, we know that in principle it might be enough to control largest miners/pools to rewrite chain history.
But if timestamping is what you need, you can actually use a combination of a trusted server with a Bitcoin blockchain.

In this context, it is a way to record how many USD user has directly in the Bitcoin blockchain (as opposed to exchange's private database).
If we do that, we can make atomic transactions which transfer bitcoins and USD amounts from one user to another at the same time. In this case one never needs to deposit bitcoins to an exchange.
E.g. Alice previously deposited $1000, and Bob wants to buy them. Exchange matches them, and they make an atomic transaction where Alice gets Bob's bitcoins, and Bob gets Alice's USD. Bob can then go to BitStamp (i.e. an exchange which issued colored coins) and withdraw them.
That's the general idea. Actual implementation might be a bit more complex to enable fast and cheap trade.

OK suppose there is a chain of transactions:

2. 0.5678 -&gt; 0.4678 + 0.1
3. 0.4678 -&gt; 0.25 + 0.2178
4. 0.2178 -&gt; 0.1678 + 0.05
IF your heuristics are able to identify transactions 2-4 as withdraw transactions, THEN you can also tell that 0.1234 is the withdraw amount, because the other output was then used in subsequent withdraw transactions and thus it MUST be a change.

First of all let's clarify that there are different kinds of smart contracts.
Ethereum-style smart contracts can actually hold cryptocurrency and do payouts according to smart contract code which can perform arbitrary calculations. Smart contracts do not have private keys, but since they are a fundamental part of a Ethereum-like cryptocurrency their logic is consensus-enforced.
Bitcoin-style smart contracts aren't pieces of code, they are cryptographic protocols which enforce certain properties. For example, "If Alice redeems coins she also has to share a secret which Bob can use to claim X". Or "Bob can claim funds after 3 days but he has to pay certain amount to Clair".
Meta-coins like XCP can implement Ethereum-style contracts, but they can only affect assets which exist within the meta-coin, but not the host currency.
Note that in both kinds mentioned above there are no private keys associated with smart contracts, and thus they cannot control multisig (or sign anything).
Finally, there's a Codius-style smart contracts which actually have their own private keys. But they aren't decentralized, they need to be hosted by certain trusted parties. If a smart contract system relies on private keys it must rely on a limited number of trusted participants. (Otherwise private keys will be known to arbitrary participants who can be adversaries willing to violate contract rules and profit from it.)
So it seems like you're confusing Ethereum-style and Codius-style smart contracts. They are like 100% different and based on different concepts.

There is no way to do this signalling in a Sybil-resistant manner.
Also, only nodes which are economically significant should matter. It doesn't matter if there are 10000 nodes signalling for 100 MB blocks if none of merchants and exchange is signalling that. And you cannot tell which of nodes are run by merchants/exchanges.
So this whole signalling thing makes no sense. If you say that signalling is meaningful you're either clueless or are actively trying to destroy Bitcoin.

There is no indication that it attracts only libertarians, let alone poorly-informed ones.

It's disingenuous to call it "the technology behind Bitcoin". Guardtime have been using a blockchain-like approach since 2007, two years before Bitcoin was released.
Moreover, essentially it's just Merkle trees and hash chains arranged into some interested pattern. Merkle trees were patented in **1979**. It's by no means new.
So, basically, a company which uses old, well-known cryptographic constructs in a slightly innovative way (I've read KSI paper so I know it's not so groundbreaking) decided to capitalize on Bitcoin/blockchain hype because Bitcoin happens to use same cryptographic constructs. (Satoshi didn't invent any new cryptographic constructs, he just figured out how to use economic incentives to secure a decentralized system.)
The only new thing here is that enterprises now start to think that they might use crypto protocols a bit more complex than the basic PKI.

When miners use Bitcoin Core with default settings, it has a small (27 KB, IIRC) "free" area in each block.
Basically, all mempool transactions are sorted according to priority (`value * age`), and top 50-100 which fit into this free area get into the block.
It is a bad idea to send 0-fee transactions hoping it will get into free area:
1. Miners can set free area size to zero, in fact, they have an incentive to do that.
2. If more than 100 high-priority transactions are produced each 10 minutes (they are), it is very well possible that your transaction will **never** get into the free area.
3. Priority of your transaction increases over time, as it depends on "coin age", but if value is small, it might take years and years until it can compete with bigger transactions.
If you ask me, the very notion of 'free area' is stupid. 
It certainly sounds good that bitcoins might be sent without a fee, but most transactions do require a fee.
So this is like a false advertisement.
If free area wasn't a thing, we would have no Bitcoin software which constructs transactions without fees (as those transactions would never be confirmed), and fewer frustrated/confused users.

Dear DCG, did you consider adding somebody who is technically competent to your team?
Even without congestion, sometimes the time between blocks is as large as 1 hour. This is how Bitcoin works, in general. Bitcoin mining is a Poisson process, thus
 * Probability of not getting a block within 30 minutes is ~5%, this happens several times a day.
 * Probability of not getting a block within 50 minutes is ~0.67%, this happens on average once per day.
 * Probability of not getting a block within 60 minutes is ~0.25%, this happens on average twice a week.
So if your demo depends on confirmation coming in 10 minutes, you're gonna have a bad time. Regardless of the situation with congestion.
So anyway, once you find somebody who actually knows how this shit works, maybe he will also tell you which scaling solution is better. Just a thought.

Nobody knows "the true value" (there is no such thing), but if you expect that Bitcoin will be used for remittance, online payments, "alternative asset" worldwide, its "market cap" needs to be a little bigger. Basically, you can estimate the market size.


Every bitcoin which is sold is bought by somebody. So the demand exists, it is just weaker than the supply, which is understandable: organic demand cannot compete with the supply of bitcoins which come from mining and liquidation of big stashes. So this will continue until we'll get a wider distribution.
An interesting question is why the speculative demand isn't there, i.e. why entities which estimate that Bitcoin is currently undervalued are not buying it. High risk, uncertainty and lack of convenient investment instruments (i.e. no ETF yet) might be limiting factors.


It is highly unlikely that Bitcoin price will linger at about the current price: it will either go down closer to $0 (Bitcoin is useless and obsure) or much higher than it is now (mass adoption warrants higher price). Hence people who believe that it is not going down $0 will tell you that it is cheap now.

2. Soft censorship (aka moderation) cannot do much damage: people who aren't 100% dumb will have no problem finding a dissenting opinion on Google.
"Freedom" is a very abstract concept. In practice, moderation means that we have to waste less time reading obnoxious bullshit people post. I don't think any person who is capable understanding arguments against SegWit would be stopped by the "theymos censorship squad".

You need a currency with highly liquidity for trading. Currently, Bitcoin is the best in terms of trade volume and market cap.
While you can transaction in Bitcoin using Counterparty, it is actually a two-step process. So it requires several confirmations. In the best case you need two confirmations, so that's 20 minutes per trade.
Meanwhile, with colored coins... we can actually do that in real-time (assuming there is an anti-double-spend oracle).
So yeah, I'd say Counterparty isn't a well thought-out solution. Most likely they were the first who contacted Patrick, and they were convincing.

OK, look, genius. Suppose a new node connects to a Bitcoin network for the first time. It needs to get addresses of existing Bitcoin nodes (at least one of them) and this is security-critical: if your node connects only to attacker's nodes, it might end up on the wrong fork.
So how do we address this bootstrapping issue?
Bitcoin people like to consider consensus mechanism in isolation, with all networking and bootstrapping abstracted out. In this case the consensus mechanism is perfect (but prone to 50% attacks, game theoretic attacks and so on.)
But if you consider a concrete system, PoS and PoW have very similar requirements, but PoS is less susceptible to the aforementioned attacks.

Thus it is a duty of a company which offers investment opportunities to prove that it is legitimate, otherwise it should be considered a scam.
For example, if I will start advertising, say, Bitcoin deposits which pay 5% a year, it should be considered a scam right away, without any evidence (usually there is no evidence when scam starts) UNLESS I precisely define what exactly is being offered, how money is going to be used, guarantees etc.
(Fun fact: I can actually keep paying 5% a year for 10 years, and then pocket 50% of the money. So it's not OK to say that something is legit just because it's been around for a while.)
So GAW offers "Digital Cloud Miners": 
These are financial products: you put some money in, then wait, and then withdraw whatever it generates. 
It's very thin on details (aside from marketing bullshit), and thus it is a scam. You shouldn't need any further evidence.
As for breaking laws, in US it is illegal to offer investment opportunities to the public without complying with regulations, so, yes, they are breaking a law.

Stake has nothing to do with political influence, it is simply a mechanism to thwart Sybil attacks and punish bad actors.
As long as you don't have a large chunk of currency concentrated in one hands, it will work fine. And if one guy owns, say, 40% of all coins, then the currency is a joke and there is no point in securing it.
All we need is to make sure that multiple independent nodes are involved in block generation. It might work fine with as little as 100 distinct stakers.

Yes, it is feasible. You just shouldn't aim for 100% success rate. Getting one of ten burgers for free is still cool, right?
With some cooperation from miners (e.g. replace-by-fee policy) these attacks can be very effective, and they are costless to miners.
FInney attack, which is described in the wiki, is a bad model for such an miner-assisted attack. replace-by-fee is better: all miners have to do is to use a different memory pool policy, which maximizes their fees.

Actually, there is: issuance period is too short. Without significant block reward subsidy it cannot be considered being secure.
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:48:48
It doesn't matter. Suppose that currently income margin is 70%, which is very good.
After halving it will be 40%, which isn't bad either. And after _another halving_ it becomes negative.
Alternatively, if income margin is 70% right now ([it is calculated]( that for the most efficient miner available right now it is 63% when Bitcoin price is $288), if price goes from $300 to $150, expenses double, and thus income margin drops to 40%, and then halving makes it negative.
The main point is that this scenario is theoretically possible and plausible. Whether it will happen on the next halving is another question.

Each server is monitored and secured by an independent party, partnered up with the Supernet.

Anyway, I think it is a bad idea for Bitcoin holders to embrace exchanges implemented on top of alt-coins, as it will strengthen those alt-coins at expense of Bitcoin.
A trustless exchange can be implemented directly on top of Bitcoin, so there is no need for that, whatsoever.

Well, I kinda liked that idea a lot when I read Ben Laurie's _mintettes_ paper. Such a system might be a bitch to set up, but if set up properly, it might be very, very resilient.
AFAIK there are no such systems deployed in practice, so it's hard to see how that will work in practice.
Ripple/Stellar are somewhat similar, but they have their own weird consensus model, but so it's not quite that.
W.r.t. government pressure, Ripple had to drop rippling and there was something with KYC... But one can argue that Ripple is 100% centralized, so it's different.

No, I'm not assuming that.
It might be profitable to buy a mining device now, mine until halving comes and then turn it off.


The last time was very different: mining was largely a hobby, and it was done on consumer hardware (e.g. gaming PCs).
The difference is that hobbyists are not so profit-conscious. Some were mining just for fun, other were doing it to support the network. It could be a good way to acquire coins: exchanges are PITA, if you have a powerful videocard you might as well mine.
So there was a lot of users who didn't care about electricity expenses. Some even had free electricity (e.g. mining on work computers).
It's very different now: mining is very competitive, it requires significant investment and consumes serious amounts of power.
As you might remember, about a half of miners kept using ghash.io simply because payouts were more consistent (they believe it is less risky that way), and didn't care that it leads to centralization and is bad for Bitcoin.
So the situation is very different now, and miners can be modeled as rational actors.


OK, let's ignore math and hope it works, somehow.

Changing difficulty retargets would affect SPV clients, but change in subsidy schedule won't. It's still going to be a hard fork, though.

Hard fork code in BU client is already enabled, it can accept bigger blocks. So one might say that the hard fork process is already underway, but it will be visible only when
1. BU miners will have more than 50% of hashpower total
2. They will accept blocks bigger than 1 MB
3. At least one of them will make a block bigger than 1 MB
You can find info about current BU hashrate here: 
It's currently at 21%, but we don't know if "signalling" means that they actually run BU clients.
So this is already quite alarming. If several large pools will join BU, a fork can happen.

No, it didn't. If you have $5/BTC difference and exchange rate is $500/BTC, then it is 1%.

If you exchange 2 bitcoins it is $10 of $1000.
Got it?
@_date: 2017-02-05 09:18:28
It's quite easy to implement such contract using nLockTime, it requires no complex constructs.
You need to make a transaction which pays to your inheritors in the future, e.g. one year from now. This transaction can be revealed publicly, e.g. sent via email to said inheritors.
Then, while you are alive, you spend those coins before the transaction locks, e.g. each 6 months. Once inputs are spent transaction becomes invalid. Then you make another transaction with nLockTime one year from now and so on.
If you are dead the coins won't be spent before the lock time, and thus inheritors will get money to their personal wallets. (You can set up paper wallets for them.)


The above doesn't require a service of any kind, it needs to be implemented on a wallet level. All you need is to log into that wallet at least once per year.
So there is no market.
An implementation as a service will be actually less secure and less trustless.
Sadly, there is no market for Bitcoin security software. As you know, Armory went belly up.
BitGo seems to be the only business in this space, maybe they'll be interested to implement this feature.

Which is just a SegWit soft-fork with lower activation threshold.
A more interesting solution is a [feather fork]( A minority of miners can take a sacrifice and penalize miners who do not signal SegWit. It's kinda costly, though.

It is only NP-complete if there is no restriction on the size of the subset.
If you only consider subsets up to K elements in size, then the trivial solution is to scan all N^K combinations.
Which means it is quite feasible if you do not need to achieve 100% success rate.

Are you saying that a smoother curve is worse? How so?
With a smooth curve you'd have a very predictable, exponentially decaying subsidy, and no price shocks.


It will have the same shape, just fewer jaggies.


It is possible to create a such formula that it will take off from the current state and gradually decrease it over time in such a way that we get to 21M limit. Same shape, fewer jaggies.
The only problem is that it is a hard fork. But if you can convince everybody to upgrade their clients, it's not a problem, whatsoever.
FYI I have M.Sc. in applied mathematics, so it will be a waste of time to debate about shapes of curves. I tell you that it's possible to have exactly the same exponential decay, but smoother shape.

Yes, something like Namecoin would be really cool.
But the problem is that Namecoin, specifically, is largely incompatible with thin clients. 
It could be like orders of magnitude more useful if it supported thin clients, as then it could be used a a library in all kinds of apps.
EDIT: OK, here's an idea: most CompSci courses cover data structures, and students are tasked to implement things like b-trees, hash-tables, etc. This is pretty much what is needed to improve Namecoin. So a CS teacher could ask students to implement something useful for Namecoin instead of usual boring shit. Or, perhaps, an interested student can ask to count Namecoin improvement instead of a normal assignments.

Money can be used in a lot of different contexts, for example:
 * savings accounts
 * buying a house
 * buying groceries
 * buying things online
 * sending funds to people abroad
 * settling debts
 * ...
You focus on things like "buying groceries" and "buying things online". But Bitcoin is really ill-suited for that kind of uses. You don't need a global decentralized network to buy groceries. And payment cards already handle that case well, so why bother?


I live in a country which recently experienced a massive inflation (currency lost 70% of its value over 2 years) and banking system instability (many banks have collapsed). I was personally affected by this, lost money in one of those collapsed banks. Government eventually compensated the loss, but I was deprived of ability to access my money for more than 6 months.
THAT is horrible. Savings aren't horrible, sorry.
So I find Bitcoin highly relevant and useful.
I dunno about you, perhaps you don't have any savings and just don't care about inflation. Then, for you, Bitcoin is just a "broken PayPal". 
But Bitcoin wasn't meant to be a PayPal or a credit card replacement. It is first and foremost a currency. Just like with dollars, people can make services and protocols on top of the base Bitcoin protocol. 
For example, [bitrated]( implements consumer protection for Bitcoin. Arguably, better than PayPal as PayPal is often biased and merchants hate it.

Do you realize that by combining several different conditions you can make system more resistant to attacks?
Checking a "known-to-be-good" node DOES NOT override PoW consensus, it strictly adds to the security of one's wallet.
It is availability-vs-security tradeoff, not a tradeoff between different security models.
As is, Bitcoin is strongly biased towards availability, which might be justified given that an attack I described isn't exactly easy to pull off. But it should be noted that Bitcoin's security is far from "unbreakable".
We aren't talking about NSA level shit, a guy having $250k in capital can pull off a $100k heist if he is able to hack networks. These numbers can become worse in future if block reward is decreased.

Well, we need to make it hard to alter transaction history.
In case with Bitcoin PoW, altering history requires a lot of computational power. In case with PoA, altering history requires _both_ computational power _and_ a lot of coins, so it is harder.
If you know a better way to implement a cryptocurrency, go ahead and describe your method.
@_date: 2015-01-05 12:43:52
Nothing-at-stake is mentioned in two different contexts:
1. Some PoS-based cryptocurrencies are badly designed, and nothing is, indeed, at stake. (Aside from coin's overall goodwill.)
2. There is also a rewrite-whole-history kind of an attack.
The first issue can be fixed with not using a bad design.
Second issue can be fixed using cementing/subjectivity. It's not a perfect solution, but it is not worse than Bitcoin if you admit that some degree of subjectivity is inevitable.
I know that Bitcoin Core developers are highly skeptical of PoS, but don't you think they might a bit biased? How much time did the spend on PoS research?
The same people who were criticizing PoS for being susceptible to a highly-theoretical, implausible attack (which can be trivially avoided) are guilty of publishing the sidechains whitepaper which has very sparse and sketchy security analysis and  several obvious flaws.

I think decentralization is a red herring: it certainly sounds cool, but doesn't provide features comparable to that of centralized exchanges, so most people keep using centralized exchanges.
How about this: we keep using centralized exchanges, but reduce amount of trust as much as possible.
Bitcoins can move directly from one user to another, we just need to record corresponding movement of fiat money to implement [delivery versus payment]( (DVP) settlement 
E.g. if Bob buys bitcoins from Alice, Bob will prepare a signed message which authorizes transfer of USD to Alice, Alice will embed this signed message into a transaction which sends bitcoins to Bob. Thus when this transaction is published, two things happen at once: bitcoins are transferred to Bob and USD are transferred to Alice, thus you have DVP.
This is _exactly_ what atomic transactions involving colored coins are: transfer of colored coin which records transfer of USD can be added to a normal Bitcoin transaction, thus implementing DVP settlement. Moreover, it also provides validation (Alice can check that Bob has USD) and solves possible race condition problems, thus it is strictly superior to other approaches.
And, yes, it is very different from what Ripple/Counterparty/BitShares/Mastercoin/etc. can provide:
 * Ripple: within the Ripple system bitcoins are represented as IOUs, thus you have the same problem that exchange  (gateway) holds bitcoins for you
 * BitShares: You won't be trading bitcoins and US dollars, you'll be trading derivatives backed by BitShares currency. If BitShares currency collapses, you end up with nothing. Also, trusted parties are responsible for pegging.
 * Counteparty: lacks an ability to do **atomic** transactions, instead uses 2-step process which is slow.
I've been advocating this approach since 2012, and I stick to it, because it is the best fit for this specific problem: if you want DVP in BTC&lt;-&gt;fiat trade, free of race condition issues and with cryptographic validation, you end up with colored coins. No other options exist.
I've implemented a proof of concept capable of atomic transactions 2 years ago, and now we have libraries which can do this in browser. But I'm yet to see exchange interested in this approach. Shared-wallet approach works for them.

Yes. Having a big network is a big advantage when you offer cash-&gt;cash remittance service. The problem is, the barrier is very high (you need to have a presence in every country, solve regulatory problems etc.; it's very expensive), and thus WU faces little competition and can charge a lot.
So how does Bitcoin fix anything?
When you have a bitcoin&lt;-&gt;cash exchange in both countries, Bitcoin can be used for remittance: Alice buys bitcoins with cash, sends them to Bob, Bob sells them for cash. These exchanges do not need to be aware of each other, they will use Bitcoin as a common layer.
In theory, the advantage here is that we expect a competition among different Bitcoin exchanges (barrier here isn't as big as with a WU-like global payment network), and the competition should drive fees down to a sensible amount.
But, in practice, there is a plenty of challenges:
 * in most countries, exchanges are not accessible by the target audience and/or have fairly large fees
 * Bitcoin volatility
 * time it takes to transfer bitcoins
There is some hope that they will be solved in future in one way or another.
Say, I can imagine a trustless protocol for instantaneous inter-exchange conversion.

Any tree-like structure in which parent nodes refer to child nodes by hash has this property.
This comes from the fact that the root hash commits to the whole tree, and traversal is deterministic.
If server provides access to every tree node by its hash, a client can do this traversal himself, and it will surely notice if server refuses to provide data for one of nodes which should be in the tree. (Or if server provides wrong data.)
Alternatively, a client might request server to perform a query (such as key-&gt;value lookup), and server will reply with a list of nodes which query have traversed.
Client can then perform the same query using data he received from server. If server replied with incomplete or corrupt data, client will notice that one or more nodes are missing.

The main point of using a blockchain in the first place is to remove reliance of centralized entities.


The incentive to attack a property registry would be to assign all property to yourself. If you have billions worth of assets secured in this way, the incentive is huge.
E.g. a centralized system might be hacked in some way to support fraud. Or maybe it will be an inside job. Or maybe it will start blackmailing people, asking for a ridiculous fee for transfer.
E.g. if you're selling a $100k art item, a registry will ask $1000 to update a record. Why not?
But if it is decentralized, there cannot be a vendor lock-in.

Yes, China will be able to source hardware cheaper, but does it matter?
It is a security hardware. Reputation is everything.
People are brand-aware even they buy ordinary consumer electronics. How many people buy noname MP3 players?
For something like a Bitcoin hardware wallet, brand reputation is much, much more important. People who buy these things plan to hold considerable amounts of bitcoins, and for them price is irrelevant as long as it is not exorbitant.
So SatoshiLabs doesn't need to worry. Sure, some people will buy knock-offs, but those people deserve to be robbed. You won't put your money into a knock-off Chinese bank, would you?

Sorry, I got it wrong. Opportunistic attacks are prevented simply by choosing a sufficiently high number of required confirmations T.
If we assume 100% participation rate for simplicity, to perform a T-deep reorganization one needs to be able to create T consecutive blocks. If T&gt;40, even somebody having 50% of all coins will have a problem, so that eliminates this kind of attacks. 
Stake confiscation is used to prevent other kinds of attacks, e.g. bribery attack where attacker will encourage stakeholders to switch to his fork by paying them bribes. It is not worth it if bribe is smaller than a bonus they get.

There is no difference. Both apps in Chrome Store and apps hosted on web are made by "random people", and it is your duty to check whether they are legit.
Particularly, if you believe that a web page is legit, then it can just point to a page in Chrome Store.
So the only practical difference is that if you download from Chrome Store, Google itself might do a MitM sort of an attack. I'm not sure if there is a way to check hash of an app you're downloading from Chrome Store. But this scenario is unlikely.

What's about [this](








@_date: 2015-01-04 18:48:04
More discussion in preceding paragraphs:
Thus we have a hybrid consensus system, which combines several different consensus mechanisms:
1. there is a strong cryptographic consensus over the colorvalue-function of Alice's output
2. there is a Bitcoin blockchain-based consensus over who currently owns that output
3. there is a trust-based consensus over the variables which are used in the function
I think it's obvious that this hybrid system has benefits over centralized trust-based systems: we only need to trust a data feed, and only to a limited extent.
A data feed doesn't have a power to block anyone's transactions, or charge fees, or discriminate different agents.
A big part of the system is fully decentralized (as decentralized as Bitcoin), and thus has all the benefits of a decentralized system:
We do not have a single point of failure (if data feed is temporarily down, transaction can still be made, that will only delay "settlements").
If the data feed goes down, clients might elect another data feed, they just need a consensus over what data feed to use.
Finally, if a data feed becomes malicious (publishes wrong data, or a  different data to different actors), clients might choose to elect a different data feed.
As settlements are not recorded in the blockchain, but are a function of the current consensus, the situation can be remedied even after a data feed publishes erroneous data: clients can undo the damage as soon as they discover the error and switch to the correct data. Thus the system can be robust to a very large degree.
It's also worth noting that we can use arbitrary consensus mechanisms on the third layer, not just simple trust-based ones.
E.g. there might be a network of trusted oracles which will make sure that everyone has the same view over what data was published.
Or there might be some kind of a Byzantine Fault Tolerant network, or a network based on a Ripple-style consensus.
At this point we are only describing a framework within which different consensus mechanism can be combined.
(A blockchain-based consensus is possible too, e.g. client might scan the blockchain for the executed trades to find the price which is used for CFD/NDF settlements, and thus achieve functionality similar to that of Counterparty.)

First of all, I've been saying that mtgox is really bad since 2011. There was a plenty of evidence that it is very, very amateurish, and there was also a lot of red flags. I really do not understand why people kept using them.
But my point was that it is too petty. If exchange operator is a scammer, he will likely try to steal lots of coins.
Pretending you have problem with a hot wallet just to get few coins sent by unsuspecting customers right after announcement is way to petty to waste reputation on.
@_date: 2015-01-05 09:18:33
Well it sounds like they either lost private keys, or they were leaked.
I really doubt a company like BitStamp would do something like that, being one of the biggest legit exchanges and having so much reputation to lose. Definitely not worth it.
So what what you do if private keys of your hot wallet are compromised and people keep sending coins to addresses associated with them? Your losses are potentially unbounded, so "will not be honored" is the only option.

The major difference is that nodes are interchangeable, while bank systems aren't.
If your bank goes awry, you're fucked. If node you're connected to goes awry, you just connect to a different node.
So no, not the same thing.
BTW I believe that connecting to random nodes is utterly fucking stupid. It is a huge gaping hole in Bitcoin protocol which nobody likes to talk about.
If attacker controls your networking he can make sure you can connect only to his nodes.
So this "we need many nodes" idea is based on idealized, broken understanding of how networking works. In reality you need a very different thing.

You didn't address a fact that now we see coin movements which are consistent with a theory that coins from MTGOX cold wallet got into MTGOX hot wallet:
1. Outputs which were previously identified as potential MTGOX cold wallet outputs were spent, something on scale of 200k BTC
2. Further, transactions which spend those outputs appeared on MTGOX API page which shows a list of MTGOX transactions
3 Further coin movements are consistent with behavior of MTGOX hot wallet (which splits them into smaller outputs).
So, basically, either there are now coins in MTgOX hot wallet, or it is a damn good simulation of it

It's the failure of the community, not a failure of Core devs. 
Core devs do their part: they make decision, discuss them, write code. They are all busy people and it's better for everyone if they focus on important matters.
Do you understand that _anyone_ who is tech-savvy enough and can write English can explain the matter which is discussed by Core devs to public? 
Few people have skills and time to work on Bitcoin Core code. But plenty of people can read mailing list &amp; IRC discussions and translate them into easily digestible articles.
So if there is a failure of communication, it is a failure of the rest of the community, not the failure of Core devs.
But if you look closely, there is no lack of explainer articles. Also many Core developers explained themselves in a very lucid way.
But when it comes to internet debate, it's not enough to explain yourself clearly. That's not enough when people use toxic rhetoric against you.
I think it could help a lot if community leaders like Erik Voorhees, Andreas Antonopoulos, Roger Ver and so on supported Core developers. They are well-outspoken guys, and they could help a lot. But, sadly, they didn't.

Bitcoins can become "gone" in two ways:
1. stolen: somebody else obtains private keys and moves to other addresses
2. private keys are lost
It is pretty much trivial to set up a system which will continuously monitor (1). It literally takes 5 minutes to write a script. If he was worried, I'm sure he would have created a notification system.
So there are three possibilities:
1. Private keys are lost due to an accident. It is unlikely they are stolen, as a thief will be interested to move coins ASAP, fearing that the original owner recovers keys from backup.
2. Mark was "worried", but did not bother to write a trivial monitoring script. He is a clinical idiot.
3. He's lying.
I'd say "he's lying" is the most plausible option here.

Yep, it's definitely possible to pay with Bitcoin when all you have is a piece of paper.
But while it is theoretically possible, it would be quite a bit inconvenient. So I doubt it will be widespread.

However, this doesn't mean that one must ditch the colored coins model to implement complex smart contracts. 
Let's summarize what we've got so far:
 1. We introduced a level of indirection: instead of getting a monetary value of an output directly, we get a function which yields a monetary value once the data is provided.
 2. A color kernel might work with functions instead of scalar values: it will receive input colorvalue-functions and will transform them into output colorvalue-functions according to the data embedded into the transaction.
 3. In order to achieve a global law of conservation (we do not want issuer's liability to depend on the contracts which are created by users among each other, i.e. users shouldn't be able to create more money for themselves), it is enough to ensure that the law of conservation is enforced by the color kernel, i.e. it checks that the value of output colorvalue-functions equals to value of input colorvalue-functions for all values of free variables.
 4. We get to the actual monetary values using a secondary consensus system, which can be arbitrary: based on trust, BFT-systems, blockchain-based, etc.

It would help if you read the wikipedia article on [devaluation]( for the start.
No, the situation is not symmetric. When the value of one of currencies soars, it doesn't mean that the rest of them are "devalued".
Forget about CHF, if BTC rises 15% against USD, does that mean that USD got devalued?
If DOGE is up 15% against BTC, does that mean that BTC got devalued?
Can I make posts "BTC devalued 15%" each time DOGE price fluctuates?
No, just fucking no, that would make no sense.
I'm sick of this brainless posting. Do you realize that it's wasting everyone's time? Thousands of people read this subreddit, so if you take, say, 10 minutes of their time, it would correspond to _weeks_ of wasted time. This is extremely rude.

My point is that the thing you're talking about already exists. You just aren't using proper terminology.
You should start from learning terms used in finance and trading: [cash-settlement]( [derivative]( [non-deliverable forward](
Also you should look at the existing work in this field. Besides OrderBook.net, there are several projects which offer these derivatives in a "trustless| manner: [BitForward]( [Ultra-coin](
The idea is that the advanced Bitcoin features, such as multi-signature scripts, can be used to greatly reduce the required trust. I.e. the exchange owner won't be able to steal any funds, he just controls how settlement is made.

The entire blockchain can be split among many nodes, so each individual node will hold only a tiny fraction of it.
Nodes really have no use for "the entire blockchain". They just validate blocks one by one against UTXO set and update the set. 
So storage isn't an issue (unless you're running a block explorer kind of a thing), but bandwidth and computing speed is.


Validation is the whole point of running a full node, so that's the only thing we need to optimize.

I think the fall from $300 to $150 was a temporary thing, quite likely someone with big pockets wanted to make money on liquidation of leveraged positions.
Basically news were fairly positive for quite some time, and so a lot of traders got into leveraged long positions. Dumping enough to go from $300 to $250 triggered margin calls/forced liquidation on those had 10x leverage and those having stop-loss at $250.
Forced liquidation and stop-loss sales then have drawn the price even lower, down to $150 on some exchanges. But I think it was obvious it was a temporary thing.
People who orchestrated this dump played on two things:
1. there are no huge amounts of USD sitting on exchanges, waiting for a significant price drop to buy bitcoins
2. there is no thing as "Bitcoin fundamentals", and thus people are seriously concerned that it can go down to 0. One cannot know if $150 is cheap.
Thus margin trading and stop-loss orders are inherently dangerous.

What's so crazy about it?
Gift cards and loyalty points have certain functions. The fact that people and companies use them instead of cash implies that those functions are important.
Bitcoin is like cash. Thus it doesn't have functions which gift cards and loyalty points have.
So you're comparing apples to oranges here.
I think the key issue here is that gift cards and loyalty points are _deliberately_ non-fungible, and thus can convey a special meaning. If you want Bitcoin to compete with them, you need to make it non-fungible in one way or another.
And it is possible, using colored coins or a similar concept.
E.g. suppose when you buy something at Macy's, you have an option to color some bitcoins into Macy's color. Then, if you spend these bitcoins at Macy's, it will give you 20% discount. You can gift those bitcoins to somebody, and he will automatically get this 20% discount, thus it's not just a cash gift. However, if that person isn't interested in buying at Macy's, he can uncolor those bitcoins and use them as regular bitcoins.
Same thing with loyalty points, if company wants to make it more useful, it might offer tokens which can be uncolored into normal bitcoins.
Alternatively, you can try to convince people that gifting bitcoins is socially acceptable and that companies should offer cash rewards instead of loyalty points... Good luck with that.

First, how hard is it to understand that regulating an exchange (which touches fiat side as well) is different from regulating the currency?
Second, we had so much success with unregulated exchanges... It's not just mtgox, there was like a dozen of exchanges and wallets which lost users' coins as a result of theft, fraud or a technical problem.
So the fact that unregulated exchanges are bad was demonstrated empirically, the fact that users do not have a qualification to tell a good exchange from a bad one was demonstrated empirically. So how can you keep claiming that we don't need no regulations?

According to my calculations they spent 3 BTC, that is $1250, to "consolidate their finances". If they waited a little they could do it for as little as 0.3-0.6 BTC. 


The previous spam attack (which happened about 1 months ago) paid large fees. Most wallets are smart now and low-fee spam attack doesn't affect them. It doesn't affect miners either now when Bitcoin Core is able to restrict mempool size. Spammers already tried flooding mempool size with ~100 MB of spam and doing it again is kinda pointless.
You have to pay large fees to do an effective Bitcoin DoS attack which users can actually notice. But a sustained attack would be crazy expensive, so they just do it for less than a day, make a couple of "blocks are full" posts and do a dump.

No, the problem is that you aren't describing your ideas clearly.
One way to do it is to lock bitcoins in a multi-sig output, and later unlock them in a settlement transaction, computing pay-off of each participants using a formula which involves the current spot price on another (real) exchange.

 * short block times (on scale of 10s of seconds) are bad and can lead to centralization

 * a back door can be inserted even in open source code, thus identities of developers are important

Sorry, I mean "over the internet". Isolating your servers from the internet will greatly reduce attack surface. (Yes, you cannot eliminate it completely, but you can reduce it.)
But if you're using AWS, your servers are always a part of AWS internal network, you can't opt-out. So an attack surface is much higher.

"Multi-sig" doesn't describe  a concrete implementation, it is simply a technical approach which might be used in one way or another:
1. Funds always sit in a multi-sig outputs: it is the safest option, but also slow and expensive. Also it affects matching.
2. Funds are split between multi-sig output and exchange's shared wallet: can use same trading engine, but it is rather cumbersome. It is essentially akin to an ability to deposit/withdraw money quickly.
3. Payment channels/aggregated settlements: this essentially combines benefits of (1) and (2), but is more technically challenging.
Which approach do you want? Note that multi-sig can also be a sham, a buzzword.
BTW I've been advocating the use of colored coins since 2012, this tech can solve it in a best possible way. You  would still need to trust exchange to do USD payments, but trading itself can be done using trustless open source code, which pretty much eliminates possibilities of "goxxing".

Oh, come on...
I could understand if this guy created open source software which would allow anyone to run a marketplace. Then one could argue that he was contributing to the freedom of trade.
But no, he was running proprietary software, and profited off it, immensely. Then he and his marketplace were busted, as he failed to implement adequate security measures. Which results in a big fallout (lost money, evidence against other people).
So, judging by results, he was a greedy, inept moron. I don't understand why Bitcoin community even considers supporting him when he caused so much grief.
You might as well support Karpeles, as Bitcoin would not be where it is now without the exchange he was running.

No, it doesn't.
 If you have 100 peers that doesn't mean they will download a transaction from you.
One peer only needs to download a transaction ones. If you have a network with N peers, each transaction will be downloaded N times, so it will be uploaded N times too, _once per peer_, _on average_.




Only because Bitcoin network code is dead simple. There is no actual need for that. Optimized network code is pretty much trivial to implement, and there's already a number of such implementations.


Number of times you upload a transaction has nothing to do with a number of peers you have. It's possible to implement fast and bandwidth-efficient network.


It is relayed twice only if you request it twice, why would you do that?


I don't think so. You don't need "supernode network architecture" to avoid sending data which recipient already has, for example.


The metric we care about is number of payments, not number of transactions. 


No. 100 Mbit/s = 12.5 Mbytes/sec = 25000 transactions/second (500 bytes per transaction). 2 is overhead factor.


Yeah I'm sure we should keep the simplistic protocol Satoshi have written, there is not reason to optimize it to scale to billion users. Let's just admit a failure.


I have taken into account 100% overhead.


No, a typical _payment_ is on scale of 300 bytes. A transaction with multiple outputs isn't a single payment. A transaction with many inputs is more like a "wallet defrag" operation rather than a simple payment.
Our goal is to be able to process many payments. If they will be batched into few large transactions, that's OK. Number of transactions per second is not an interesting metric because size of transaction varies greatly, it's a sloppy proxy metric for a number of payments.
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:08:31


I didn't mean that defragmentation itself is a waste, a legitimate use for that is moving coins to a cold wallet.
Poor fee selection is where the waste is. They paid something like 5x more than it should cost. Some transactions had 400 s/B fee rate, while you can get transaction confirmed at 30 s/B if you wait a bit.
So if they paid $10000 total for defragmentation, $8000 was a waste.
It has nothing to do with poor timing either because a fee was set manually.


Sidenote: This depends on your spending patterns, you might be paying up to 2x more in some cases.


Which implies that either it's a scam which doesn't care about it's profit margins because they are already sky-high, or people deliberately clogging the network.

But what if you need not just a running bitcoind, but a fully indexed blockchain?
If you do anything non-trivial you need an ability to find transaction history for a certain address. And relying on third-party services (like blockchain.info) seriously defeats the purpose of using Bitcoin.
So in my experience, with the current blockchain size, building this index takes 1-2 months if you use HDD disks. (Of course, this depends on DB backend and schema. We use PostgreSQL, which is quite mainstream, and fairly minimal schema. LevelDB might be somewhat faster.)
With SSD (and lots of RAM, that helps too) it takes less time, but SSD is expensive. In our case bitcoind and DB need 200 GB of storage right now.
The biggest plan ChunkHost offers is 60GB SSD storage. A machine with 320 GB SSD disk will cost you $ 320 / mo if you buy it from DigitalOcean.
So right now it is a minor annoyance, but if we increase block size by a factor of 20, the blockchain might also grow by a factor of 20 in a couple of years. 
And then it will take 1 year to index it using HDD, and 3 TB worth of SSD will cost you at least $3000 per month.
So there will be a tremendous pressure to use centralized services like blockchain.info and chain.com, which give you easy-to-use API, but you become fully dependent on them.
Also, BIP37 is absolutely not sustainable. If number of SPV clients exceeds a number of nodes by several orders of magnitude (e.g. 1 million clients vs 10000 nodes), nodes won't be able to keep up with requests due to I/O limitations. (Unless nodes keep the whole blockchain in RAM.) And still restoring your old wallet might take days...
So again, there will be a pressure on SPV clients to resort to use centralized services like blockchain.info.
tl; dr: Running a node isn't the hard part, indexing is.

Bitcoin blockchain offers a fairly good decentralized consensus, it might be an optimal choice for applications which need it. I don't think people will abandon making such applications just because of your opinion of what Bitcoin "wants" (what does it even mean?).
On the other hand, blockchain bloat can be minimal, e.g. instead of posting every piece of data you need consensus over on the blockchain, you can post just a hash of the whole dataset.
Thus the Bitcoin blockchain can empower lots of interesting applications, essentially for free, what's wrong with that?

To do this exchange, you need someone who has USD/Bitcoin/gold and needs Bolivar. As you can imagine, this is not easy, as pretty much nobody wants to hold large quantities of Bolivar.
Another option is to do this indirectly, i.e. buy some goods with Bolivar and sell them for bitcoins. You need to be able to ship goods abroad, not sure if it's possible.
You might also try to cater to tourists. Perhaps, partner with local hotels and advertise tours which can be paid for using bitcoins.

It can be done using a separate communication protocols which clients can use.
1. Alice writes to Bob via IRC/Skype/anything: "Bob, I want to buy something from you, my BitMessage address is bm-xyz".
2. Bob then enters this address into his BitMessage-aware Bitcoin wallet.
3. He can send Alice an invoice which will have an unique address.
4. Alice will receive this invoice through her BitMessage-aware Bitcoin wallet, and can pay it off.
Thus stealth addresses only have advantage in non-interactive scenarios.

Wrong. This is a blatant mistake, person who wrote this knows nothing about calculating probabilities.
If the probability of winning a lottery is `p`, then probability to winning it twice in a row is `p * p`, not `p / 2`. Probability of winning the lottery N times in a row is `p ^ N`.
So if probability of finding a collision on the first try is `1/2^160` and probability of winning a lottery is `1/176000000`, then we need to find N such that 
     1/176000000^N = 1/2^160
     N * ln(176000000) = 160*ln(2)
     N = 160 * ln(2) / ln(176000000)
     N = 5.841334705
So you are *less* likely to win this lottery 6 times in a row than to find a collision. 6 times, not 830,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times!

To resolve a name you need to scan the whole blockchain. (OK, last 30k blocks or so.)
There is no index of names, so to speak.
Adding this functionality is not that hard. Basically, you need to create index datastructure, miners will update it when they see changes in name registrations, and publish these updates along with blocks.
In terms of complexity, it is something a smart CS undergrad could do.
But people care more about monetization than they care about decentralization, so it haven't been done yet. 
Services which use namecoin are centralized... which sort of defeats the whole purpose.  They publish data on the namecoin blockchain, which is nice, but actual resolution is done through their service.

Among Bitcoin users, there are people who already have a sizeable stash (pretty much everyone who got them before 2013) and most of them hold or spend what they have, but do not buy more bitcoins.
And then there are people who earn bitcoins. And people who purchase bitcoins only to spend them right away, thus not affecting the price (assuming that merchant immediately sells bitcoins).
Thus only a fraction of all Bitcoin users is purchasing more and more bitcoins to increase their stash. It is hard to say how big is this fraction, but, apparently, not big enough to keep the price stable.

It is a protocol, literally for peer-to-peer trade, you can find more detailed description here: 


Basically yes, the protocol defines message format (offers, partial transactions), and the implementation defines the logic.
It can work with any communication medium, for now we're using the simplest one: HTTP service. But it is literally something which can be replaced in a couple hours of hacking.
Also it's worth noting that Iridis implements a protocol which is very similar to p2ptrade, but uses different format. (NIH syndrome is strong...)


What are you going to trade if not colored coins?
Counterparty? Counterparty does not support atomic transactions. There is no guarantee that the asset will be there once you sign the transaction.
Only colored coins support this feature because colored coin transaction graph is exactly the same as Bitcoin transaction graph, and thus double-spend of a colored coin would invalidate the transaction.
Check [this stuff]( p2ptrade is just a practical, working implementation of 'atomic coin swapping'.


Depends on what kind of colored coins you're using. It's definitely possible with EPOBC which is what is used in ChromaWallet.

Why is it asinine? The problem is that people already use term [micropayments]( to describe fairly substantial amounts of money:


Hence to describe payments in smaller amounts, you need another term. Nano is 3 orders of magnitude than micro, thus if $10 USD is a micropayment, $0.01 USD is a nanopayment. So this seems to be about right.
On the other hand, if we define that 10 BTC is a normal payment, then:
 * micropayment is 0.00001 BTC ~= $0.0035 USD
 * nanopayment is 1 satoshi 
So this kinda makes sense.

It is a different kind of atomic swaps...
Basically, the goal is to achieve cross-chain trade, and it is possible to make it atomic the sense that as soon as one party reveals the secret, other party will be able to withdraw coins as well. So it is atomic from cryptography's point of view, but not actually atomic.
The practical difference is speed. A colored coins transaction can be signed in less than a second, and it is immediately protected by Bitcoin mempool rules, i.e. canceling a trade once is signed is hard. Usually it will be confirmed in the very next block. So you have some confidence that trade was executed in less than one second, and hard guarantee that it was executed after 1-2 confirmations. And there is no risk involved: in worst case, you get your bitcoins/colored coins back.
Counterparty DEX is worse: one can only send bitcoins once match is confirmed, so it takes two confirmations in the best case. In worst case, the party which sends bitcoins can cancel at any time until order times out in 20 or 40 blocks (don't remember exact number). Moreover, there is a risk that bitcoins will be lost if:
1. payment doesn't get into the blockchain before timeout is reached (20-40 blocks, so it is rare...)
2. the matched order is orphaned and transactions are reordered
So, in practice, if you want to play it safe, Counterparty DEX transactions involving bitcoins might take a hour or two. And there is still some risk, even if it is 99.99% safe.
Atomic cross-chain trade is even slower than Counterparty DEX. Basically, it has same problem as Counterparty DEX, but exacerbated by using two blockchains...
You can see, the wiki article recommends timeouts on the scale of days.
But wait, there is more... Colored coins is already the fastest method, but what if you want to get a good guarantee sooner than on one confirmation? It is possible, using multi-sig and double-spend-prevention oracle (service). There is no theoretic limit to how fast you can transact. And in the worst case (service is untrustworthy), you get your money back.


Sure, but that won't be an improvement over Counterparty DeX.


Turing completeness doesn't make things fast and efficient. :) Turing completeness just means that you can execute some complex contracts automatically, but confirmation speed is an entirely different matter.

Well, if you're hosting your own hardware, typically all the machine will be on your internal local network, and a router will only forward the web traffic to the web server machine.
Only devices which have access to your local network have access to traffic on your local network. Thus, unless one of them is compromised, all communications (e.g. between web and database servers) are private.
If you're hosting your service on AWS, it will, at minimum, consist of EC2 node talking to EBS node.
So, potentially, it can be attacked in four ways:
1. attack an application running on EC2
2. attack EC2 itself (e.g. through mgmt interface)
3. attack the network which connects EC2 and EBS
4. attack EBS
Perhaps it would be easier to visualize it this way:
1. if it is your own hardware, a web server can be connected with a database server with a piece of wire
2. if you're hosting app in AWS, a web server is connected with a storage server using AWS network, which is really complex and is based on managed switches, and it is something which _can_ be attacked

Wrong. Trading can help to stabilize the price, which will make Bitcoin more useful.
But, obviously, only a certain kind of trading. Not stop-loss, the opposite: you buy more as the price gets lower.
E.g. suppose you would keep 5% of your bitcoin investment as a reserve in USD. When Bitcoin price goes down 50%, you spend half of it to buy more bitcoins. Another 50% you spend half of the remaining reserve, etc.
Compared to a simple 'hodl' strategy, it helps to stabilize the price. And it is no more than 5% different from a simple 'hodl', as you can keep 95% of your investment in bitcoins.

It seems the idea of a pseudorandom selection of a stakeholder to build a block is still quite popular, and is employed in recently published Ouroboros and ALGORAND.
Ouroboros claims to be "the first proof of stake blockchain protocol which provides rigorous security guarantees." ALGORAND is designed by a famous cryptographer so it's probably quite good too.
PoW/PoS hybrid probably has a better chance as a Bitcoin upgrade: people who find PoS icky might be satisfied by PoW component, also it is possible to use existing mining infrastructure. Some variation of the classic proof-of-activity was implemented in Decred.

There is no significant difference between SPV wallet and a full node in terms of code complexity: both need to implement the Bitcoin network protocol and transaction signature validation (if you want support for advanced features, such as payment channels).
So you might as well implement a full node (if anything, just for testing purposes) and then use its parts as an SPV wallet.

Are you implying that Mark is the one who created SR and Ross later took it over from him?
I think you've got it wrong. First of all, Ross claims that he created SR.
Second, we don't know who of them was "technically untalented" from this piece, as creating a marketplace definitely does require some talent, but discovering a vulnerability also requires some prowess. Pretty much every complex system has a vulnerability of some sort, it is not a sign of a lack of tech talent.
Third, "willing to help out 1st guy for free" part is wrong: in the end the 2nd guy became the owner, so he earned **a lot** from it.
So it is far more plausible that Ross U., being a libertarian, started it as an experiment. 
But then Karpeles, who wanted to build a vertically-integrated Bitcoin business (MtGox converts dollars to bitcoins, which are then used to buy drugs) took over the ownership of SR.
Note that Karpeles _bought_ MtGox from Jed McCaleb, so apparently growing business through acquisition was his strategy. Fits quite well.

It's more like FUD which PoW proponents like to spread. Even though the reasoning used in this document is correct, your assumptions are biased towards PoW, so no wonder you arrive to a conclusion that PoW is fundamentally superior.
If you start with different assumptions you can arrive to a different conclusion. E.g. let's consider this scenario:
 * fixed number of participants, all of which are present from the start
 * no long-term communication problems, i.e. every participant can exchange message with each other participant at least once in a while
If we assume that there are protocols which work well within certain finite time-frames (we described one of such protocols in [Cryptocurrencies without Proof of Work]( a problem with an "alternate history" can be addressed via "cementing": honest nodes will assume that old parts of the chain are immutable below a certain point and will ignore any alternative history.
Intuitively, there is no point in changing a transaction history which is, say, 1 month old.
If we assume that all nodes are able to communicate with each other within 24h time frame, it means that you always know **all** different version of 24h old history. So if a new version appears in 48 hours, it definitely comes to attacker who deliberately tried to change history, as otherwise you would have heard about it earlier.
It's worth noting that nodes only need to rely on cementing in a global conspiracy kind of scenarios. Normally (like, in 99.9999% cases) they will rely on other mechanisms, so you don't really need to take cementing into account when you consider incentive structures.
Now back to the question, having a fixed number of participants which are there from start is not cool. But the point here is that you cannot claim that PoS is not convergent. It might be not convergent from the point of view of new nodes.
Bootstrapping of new nodes is a separate problem. Bitcoin also has it: if you're a new node, and you haven't discovered any of the honest nodes, attacker can easily direct you to his fork.
Vitalik Buterin described it in his [weak subjectivity]( article. It reeks of common sense.
Sure, Bitcoin might be superior ... as an abstract cryptocurrency in a vacuum. If you consider real-world usage -- i.e. user installing a program on his computer, bootstrapping it, etc. -- then it becomes obvious that Bitcoin fundamentally suffers from the problems of the same nature, and thus PoS is not inferior in this sense.

This is interesting and remarkable, but the most likely explanation is operator error and bad luck:
 * first transactions were not confirmed because fee was low, especially during the stress test
 * it was an operator error to not include any of A inputs in transaction B
 * the fact that tx A got confirmed after B is kinda remarkable, but could happen naturally (a high-priority zero-fee transaction got into mempool of one of nodes and later included into a free space), or with little help of somebody who wanted a double payout; this definitely doesn't require 51% collusion

Why do you rule out the possibility that they will simply plan to shut it down after halving?
Yes, they are investing a lot of money into those operations, but that doesn't mean they plan to run them forever. It really doesn't matter how long they work, if bitcoins they generate over their lifetime are worth more than is spent on electricity and hardware.
IIRC the first generation of ASICMINER devices got obsolete in less than a year, but ASICMINER still made a killing on them.
And note that I'm not saying that we'll have a problem on the next halving. It's possible that miners have big margins now, after halving margins will become small, but it will still be profitable to mine. And after the next halving they will have to turn it off (in 6 years, that is).
The point is that this situation is possible and even plausible. Specifics is another matter.
But anyway, is it possible that we'll have this problem in 2016?
Yes. [This post]( claims that Antminer S4 is the most efficient miner available on the market now. If you take its specs and enter into [mining calculator]( you see that you break-even in one year, if price and difficulty do not change.
Thus it would make sense to buy them now and shut down after halving if it becomes unprofitable.

"Specifying what you want software to do" and "writing the software code" is the same thing, in my opinion.
The difference is that a specification should describe _what_ software should do, but not _how_ it should work, i.e. it should omit all the unnecessary details.
But it's the case with code in high-level languages, particularly DSLs. An ideal DSL requires only a minimal set of parameters, and the rest if figured out by the compiler.
Perhaps Code Valley people invented better abstractions. Building abstractions in a layered fashion can be done e.g. using Lisp-style macros. But Code Valley's approach enables interaction of different abstraction layers before the decisions are made. The way I understand it, it can be seen as a program-wide constraint-solving step before the code is generated. This additional step can potentially lead to better automation and thus fewer unnecessary details need to be specified.
This is interesting, but we don't know whether this approach actually makes a difference, whether it scales, etc.
Sadly Code Valley people are focused on monetization and aren't revealing much detail about their invention.

OK, few notes:
 * the most interesting thing would be a library which allows name resolution and/or verification
 * you do not actually need to store all block headers, you only need the last block header, as its hash commits to the whole block chain, which you can download as needed
 * thus a resolver library needs only few KB of state, and thus is suitable for use in browser extensions, web pages, mobile apps, etc.
 * instead of a special gettxbyname command, you can simply allow traversal of the tree data structure

There is no need for that. If network is more-or-less uniform, it will average out. That's just how math works: if a transaction is downloaded N times, it is uploaded N times.
So one node needs to upload more than its fair share (on average) IF AND ONLY IF some other node systematically uploads less than its fair share.
If you measure things the way they are now, you will find that a typical node uploads a lot.
But there have been ZERO effort spent on optimizing bandwidth. Bitcoin network, as is now, is optimized for the speed of propagation (well, sort of, it is really optimized for simplicity).
If you take a bunch of undergrad CS students and ask then "Can you guys design a protocol which will be a bit better in terms of bandwidth fairness?" I can assure you they will do much better than it is now. And Bitcoin has access to world's best specialists. Bandwidth conservation is just a non-goal now, so no wonder it's inefficient.


Yes, that's why I used 50% efficiency in calculation. I feel like 50% efficiency might be attainable. It's just a ballpark number. Maybe it will be 30%, that's good too. But 5% efficiency as you're assuming isn't good.


So you assume we'll have the same shitty code if Bitcoin goes 1000x bigger in your thought experiment?
I think it's really intellectually dishonest to claim that bandwidth is the bottleneck when you do calculation using a model which is not optimized for bandwidth. When something is bottleneck people optimize for that. So to calculate an _upper bound_ you should assume the best possible implementation.


May I ask you, are you a programmer? I would never hire a person who says that sending a list of transaction hashes is not trivial.
But yes, implementation already exists: 
Note what it says: "Using **simple** techniques it is possible to reduce the amount of bandwidth necessary to propagate new blocks to full nodes when they already share... ". It's not a rocket science! (Compared to IBLT, for example, which is indeed very non-trivial.)


It doesn't. There was time when people thought that fast propagation is going to prevent double-spends, but now it's pretty clear it's bullshit.


Sorry, what? That's how it always worked: a node sends inv vector, and another node replies with getdata after filtering known elements.
Perhaps you should learn how existing protocol works before doing your calculations.

No, they used transaction ids to tell whether transaction was successful or not.
This doesn't mean UTXO tracking works through the same mechanism.

This is why I think linear growth makes much more sense than exponential: linear growth approximates diminishing returns and possible plateu-ing.
E.g. suppose we start from 1 MB and grow it by 1 MB per year. After 10 years you'll have increase of 10%, which isn't much. Even if no new technology is introduced at this time, internet connections might become faster simply because customers ditch old technology.
While exponential growth requires, e.g. 50% growth each year, which is crazy.
On the other hand, if we start from 1 MB in both cases, linear growth by 1 MB per year will actually exceed exponential 50% growth.
So it is a better schedule, and also is also dead simple.

Yes. Your typical HDD can do only about 100 reads per second. That means that if somebody will send you transactions are a rate faster than 100 per second, you won't be able to cope with that if most UTXOs are stored on disk.

Wrong. If attacker is unable to perform a 50+% attack (e.g. he is unable to buy or rent more than a half of total hashpower), then number of confirmations does matter.
Please check [this]( and stop repeating this myth.
Note that if attacker is able to acquire 50+% of all hashpower, then, in theory, he will be able to perform costless attacks: he can keep the subsidy and get revenue from double-spending. Thus in this case Bitcoin security goes down the toilet.

Do you know how priority works? If you have enough priority, fee is irrelevant and can be 0.


Mining code works this way: it first picks high-priority transactions up to the space limit (which can be 0), and only then selects transactions by fee.
Some miners believe that sorting by priority is actually beneficial during the spam attack because it prioritizes non-spam transactions. So it's possible that some miner increased free transaction space, and old transaction got confirmed.

bitcoin.org policy is to remove client which implement hard fork changes. Coinbase people claimed they use BIP 101 (which is a hard fork) software on production servers, and hence it was delisted. It's plain and simple.
Many people here are biased in favor of BIP 101, thus they don't see the problem.
But we can consider a different situation: Suppose that BIP 666 introduces a modification where 25 BTC subsidy stays forever, i.e. it makes Bitcoin a perma-inflationary currency. There might be justification for that, i.e. we have better security and whatnot. Suppose Coinbase announces that their nodes are patched with BIP 666.
I think that everybody here will agree that they should be delisted in that case because they are running nodes with incompatible changes.
So what do you think bitcoin.org should do:
1. allow all hard forks
2.  allow only benevolent hard forks
3. do not allow any hard forks
Option 1 is clearly bad for security and network stability. Option 2 will require subjective judgement and thus goes against bitcoin.org of staying neutral.
Thus the only option is 3: do not allow any hard forks.
This is the only logical approach, but you people aren't friends with logic.

I'm sure business people know how to build secure systems. After all, none of billion-dollar companies ever suffered from an attack.
And these cloud systems are so highly available. E.g. "On April 20, 2011, some parts of Amazon Web Services suffered a major outage.  A portion of volumes utilizing the Elastic Block Store (EBS) service became "stuck" and were unable to fulfill read/write requests. It took **at least two days** for service to be fully restored." It's mind blowing.




So, basically, BitStamp's servers create transactions and BitGo signs them. Right?
Now what if BitStamp's server is hijacked, and it will create transactions... How does BitGo know not to sign them?

Another option is sidechains (particularly, Sidechain Elements): transactions done within a sidechain are off-chain from Bitcoin's point of view, and they can be later settled on the Bitcoin blockchain. The sidechain itself can be a private blockchain controlled by one or several parties.
If settlement using Bitcoin is unnecessary, approach taken by Factom and OpenChain can be relevant: private blockchain's block content is timestamped in the Bitcoin blockchain.

I didn't mention any _outside_ bad actors.


Currently, it would cost one about $150k/day to guarantee that no transaction with fee lower than 100 satoshi/byte is confirmed. For a typical 250-byte transaction that's a $0.25 fee. You need proportionally more money to drive fees further.
In other words, clogging is pretty expensive. 


It works the way it works. If you feel you can do it better, go ahead and invent a better Bitcoin.
There is no such thing as an "outside influence" in Bitcoin: it is an open system, anyone can participate as long as he pays for that/has resources.


None of things you mentioned make a lot of difference. E.g. 2 MB blocks would rise clogging costs from $150k/day to $300k/day. Same shit.
Lightning is tricky: on the one hand, it reduces the effect of clogging as low-value transactions can be moved offchain. On the other hand, it can make clogging very very dangerous.

50 BTC.
The reason is that the genesis block is added to the blockchain in a special way.
Normally code which adds a block to the blockchain goes through all transactions and their outputs (coins) to unspent transaction output list, thus making them spendable.
But the genesis block isn't added in a normal way because the chain doesn't yet exist at that point. And special code which initializes the blockchain doesn't add outputs to unspent transaction output list... Thus a node is simply won't recognize genesis coins as spendable as it's not aware of it.
I think it's just a bug, Satoshi simply forgot to call a function to add genesis coins on initialization. People say that maybe Satoshi did it on purpose, but then he could set reward to 0.
Fixing this would require a hard fork, so we can just accept that 50 BTC are gone forever.

**Meta-coins like XCP can implement Ethereum-style contracts, but they can only affect assets which exist within the meta-coin, but not the host currency.**
@_date: 2014-09-30 13:56:53
If your goal is to reduce Bitcoin price volatility, 2-of-3 multisig is probably the closest thing to trustless. E.g. Alice and Bob put 1 bitcoin each into 2-of-3 multisig. They agree to do the settlement according to a certain formula which references BTC/USD price. They third key belongs to Operator, which can unlock the payment if Alice or Bob are uncooperative.
The problem with it is that
 * it heavily depends on Operator's honesty
 * you cannot compensate for price hike higher than 50%.
If you want a game-theoretically sound solution, Operator should receive a compensation for each contact he signs correctly. If net present value of fees he might collect in future is higher than the value of contract, a rational Operator shouldn't defect.
Colored coins can only make it more convenient, but they do not remove the need for trust. (At least not if Btcoin is our base currency).
Counterparty has built-in CFD mechanism, but it works only for assets which exist within Counterparty. E.g. if somebody issues USD within Counterparty, you can have trustless CFDs, but then again, you can just buy these USD and have same risk. (CFD are useful only for shorting or leveraged bets.)
Finally, Ethereum is powerful, but I'm not sure how much it can do for Bitcoin-based contracts. (And ether isn't as good as Bitcoin as a currency, in my opinion.)


I called it pseudo-NDF because it isn't a real NDF. You have accurate settlement only if price is within a certain range. If it is out of it, payout will be capped.
We can call it 'capped NDF's, but I don't think such things exist in the finance world.
I had a lengthy debates about capped vs non-capped contracts with ICBIT.se developer back in 2011, and 2 years later he suffered losses because he went with non-capped ones. Also I think it might be the reason this exchange doesn't see a bigger volume...

There are many different kinds of mobile wallets. Here's a better classification:
1. Full node: Downloads and validates all the data. Example: Bitcoin Core
2. SPV using Bitcoin protocol: Downloads and validates block headers and Merkle tree branches. Fetches UTXOs from nodes using Bloom filter queries. Sync time is non-zero, but much faster than full node. Example: Bitcoin Wallet for Android.
3. SPV using special API: Downloads and validates block headers and Merkle tree branches like above, but UTXO queries go through a special API which is much more efficient. Sync time is non-zero, but can be minimal. Example: Electrum.
4. Non-SPV wallet with local signing: It trusts the server it works with to do the validation. Sync time can be close to zero. Example: Blockchain.info
5. Shared wallet: Wallet is implemented completely on server, no syncing is needed. Example: Coinbase
Number 4 can be expanded further into several varieties: one constructs transactions from UTXOs locally, another receives unsigned transactions from server.

If your coin exists as a colored coin on the Bitcoin blockchain, it can be exchanged for bitcoins in a trustless way.

Karpeles isn't " technically untalented". He implemented SSH in PHP. He implemented  a custom Bitcoin transaction processing in PHP.
These are not small feats, things like that are very hard, and I'm sure 95% of programmers out there won't be able to do that. Mark demonstrated that he knows the protocol, can do fairly advanced things, etc.
So Karpeles isn't dumb. He is silly: he lacked common sense to NOT do these things.
You know, when a normal programmer would have used an established library or a backend, if anything, to benefit from fixes made by other people, Karpeles was like "fuck it, I can do whatever I want".
So I wouldn't be surprised if it was Karpeles who found some vulnerability. Finding vulnerabilities doesn't require as much discipline as building secure systems.

But in future they might block stuff which is necessary for LN. So hash-warfare is real.

Suppose that to have certain security properties you need a hash tree of a certain kind.
Can you store this hash tree in a relational database? Yes.
Can you use a relational database instead of a hash tree? No. Most likely a relational database doesn't have, by itself, properties you want, so you need to do something.
Perhaps you can implement triggers and stored procedures which will automatically timestamp data you add to the database using hash trees. That would be nice, but you're still using hash trees.

There are two separate issues: pressure on miners and pressure on nodes.
Bigger blocks generally result in higher orphan rate for miners, which results in reduced profits. In theory, it should be about the same for all miners, however, miners can reduce their orphan rate (and thus increase profits) through tighter cooperation. More transactions =&gt; bigger blocks =&gt; more pressure to get together, merge, etc. Cooperating miners might also form a cartel and collectively control Bitcoin. E.g. they can discourage new miners from joining the network by not offering them optimization opportunities which they have within the group.
Bitcoin is structured in a way that every full node processes ever transaction. If nodes need process more transaction they need to consume more network bandwidth, CPU power, memory and storage. It might become unfeasible for ordinary people to run full nodes.
Why would we care about it? Well, the whole selling point of Bitcoin is that you don't need to trust anyone, you can run your own full node and verify all transactions directly.
If you use an SPV client, you have to trust miners. A miner can create a block with a bunch of fake payments and feed it to your SPV client and you'll know no better.
Another problem is that SPV clients usually rely on full nodes to feed them data, but if people will stop running full nodes we'll have very few of them and they won't be able to serve data to millions of SPV clients. In this case users will have to resort to use centralized services like Coinbase or blockchain.info.
There are technical solutions to each of this problems, but it will take years to research, develop and deploy them. People are asking to increase number of transactions per second _right now_, before the tech is improved.
Note that we are talking about significant increase of number of transactions per second. Pretty much everybody agrees that 4x increase is OK with the current state of tech. but 10x increase is more debatable, not to mention 100x...

Demand for transactions is nearly infinite. If transactions were free, I'd just store an encrypted copy of my hard drive on blockchain, why not?
If we ignore data storage applications (but we shouldn't, because blockchain is fundamentally a replicate data store and discouraging data storage is very hard), people could send a lot of financial transactions.
Why not send a tiny tip each time you upvote somebody? Why not send a tip to every page you visit? Why not implement a faucet page which sends a tiny amount to each visitor in exchange for him seeing ads? Why not implement a gambling service where every bet is on-chain transaction? (Like Satoshi Dice did.)
The answer to all of those questions is "because that would be too expensive". Demand, in general, is practically unlimited, but demand at every price point is limited.


"An arbitrary artificial cap" is one way to model external costs. For example, fishing quotas prevent overfishing. There is a demand for cheaper fish, and it could be satisfied with removing quotas. But that would undermine the system in the long run.
Likewise, a block size cap makes sure that blockchain system is viable in the long run.


Bitcoin isn't a business, it's a complex system with a lot of actors. We need to make sure that all involved actors are doing well.
There exists an asymmetry: miner benefits from adding a transaction to a block, but all other nodes incur a cost.

They imply that users are confused and shops are dropping out because of confirmation delays:


However, confirmation time is random, by design. Inter-block time longer than 40 minutes happen twice per day on average (assuming 10 minute target). Thus even in perfect conditions when all transactions are confirmed in the very next block transactions might remain unconfirmed longer than 40 minutes. And it's not extraordinary, it happens every day.
I'd say people who expect 10 minute wait time are really ignorant of how Bitcoin works and shouldn't be using it.
Bitcoin is designed to confirm transactions within hours.

One potentially useful thing is [GHOST]( a protocol modification which can potentially improve scalability. It was originally proposed as a Bitcoin improvement, but Bitcoin devs didn't care. Ethereum have adopted some modification of GHOST, so now algorithm is battle-tested.
There are also several different implementations of PoS which might be relevant if Bitcoin ever considers changing consensus algorithm.

Yes, I didn't. I could, probably, write several hundreds of pages of text on this topic, but for now I just wanted to illustrate the problem in an accessible way.
I don't think safeguards and monitoring tools can prevent attacks of this nature. Forking blocks can be mined in private, so attack cannot be detected before it happens. And after it happens, it's too late.
If safeguards are in place, attacker won't be able to sell his coins again immediately. But he'll be able to repeat the attack in a week or two. So it doesn't change much in the grand scheme of things.
These safeguards will be relevant if they are a part of cryptocurrency's consensus mechanism. I believe it's possible (in fact I had a plan to implement a cryptocurrency with 51% attack resistance), but is quite a bit tricky.

The majority of people in the world live in not-so-stable countries, where local currencies aren't stable, banks aren't trustworthy, and keeping dollars under the mattress isn't 100% safe either because crime is very much real too.
But, according to you, this are "rare anecdotal situations", as average US consumers are the norm now. And the rest of the world are outliers.
It's, apparently, a norm now to live without savings, being at mercy of financial institutions who might or might not lend you money when you need it. Apparently, savings are horrible.
It will be hilarious once you experience "rare anecdotal situations" yourself. Greece and Cyprus were considered 1st world countries, yet people in these countries suffered from banking woes.

Hearn and Armstrong want Bitcoin to be governed by miners rather than by users. If there's a conspiracy, this is it, because it changes Bitcoin in a radical way without sounding very suspicious (as even Satoshi highlighted importance of miners).
Governments and banks will like miner-governed Bitcoin, as they'd need to control maybe a dozen of entities to control Bitcoin. It's much easier than controlling each user.

Blocks are mostly full, that's true. I don't see that being a major problem, though.

The Bitcoin whitepaper isn't a holy book. It's not a specification of the protocol either. It's a high-level overview which explains motivation and concepts.
It's an introductory-level material, not a thorough analysis. As such, it has to skip subtleties to make core ideas more accessible.
Satoshi wanted to highlight the importance of PoW, since that's the core idea behind Bitcoin, something which made it different from previous e-cash systems.
Is Bitcoin controlled by miners, nodes or users? 
Each of this groups has influence, but none of them has complete control.
I remember back in 2010/2011 we discussed that miners don't have complete control over the system, their role is rather limited. It was common knowledge back then, it's not a new realization.
Then in 2012 Gavin Andresen [described]( a way to neutralize 51%. It's a way to beat those who have "more CPU power". It looks like Gavin disagreed with Satoshi's quote you posted above.
Was Gavin wrong? Or... Did you consider a possibility that reading one introductory-level paper is not enough to understand a highly complex system in it's entirety?

Valery Vavilov for president!


I'd like to reiterate this point, I'm afraid few people get this.
In the developed countries (US, Europe...) people associate money with credit cards, as they use them daily. So, for them, it is money if they can buy groceries with it. That's why they emphasize importance of point-of-sale payments.
But here in Ukraine we have an actual problem, neither the government nor banks are trustworthy. People who have savings usually keep them in US dollars, and often in cash. You can't buy groceries with US dollars, they are not accepted in stores. However, you can easily exchange your dollars for a local currency, hryvna, and then use it to buy things.
So we understand money as something which is preserves value well and is liquid (can be exchanged easily), whether it is accepted in stores or not doesn't matter.
Bitcoin's "killer app" is store of value which is independent of governments and banks, we should focus on that.
As for 0-conf payments, this can be done securely without any complex technology, using so-called "green address" approach: get every transaction co-signed by a trusted party. But people keep using highly unsafe 0-conf based on mempool policies. We need to break unsafe 0-conf to make safe 0-conf work. It's needed not for technical reasons, but because right now people just don't see a problem and don't feel a need to upgrade to something better, establish common protocols etc. It isn't hard to implement, but right now people have 0 incentives to switch.

But there is a huge problem in practice: we'll have to trust centralized exchanges to be able to do that.

Two consecutive blocks were more than 90% filled by weird transactions:
 * hundreds of inputs
 * one or two outputs
 * output is almost exactly 10 BTC
 * around 60000 bytes each
 * paying 50 satoshi per byte, 5x over the normal rate
Spam transactions, all looking the same, constitute 90% of block [ It's even worse in the next block [ -- 96% of the block space is consumed by them.
Yeah must be people buying bitcoins, not people trying to stuff blocks with spam.
Or, you know, somebody desperately wanted to merge thousands of his inputs into 10 BTC coins, and he didn't mind paying 5x the normal fee (or 10x the minimal fee) to do it swiftly.

They will continue to receive block rewards, but if users do not like the fork they will switch to other cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin exchange will drop. Thus the dollar value of these block rewards will be much lower, potentially zero. That's what these miners are losing.

1. It can only be done by ones who have relevant keys or whatever is used to secure the blockchain, not by 'anyone'.
2. If they do so, you can prove them wrong by demonstrating your copy of the blockchain. You cannot prove that your version is right, but you can prove that they violated their promise to manage only a single copy of a blockchain.
if that company owes you something, you have the right to demand it. It works the same way as with digital signatures. E.g. suppose Alice gives Bob a signed check for $100. Then she makes another check for $50 and claims that Bob's check isn't original. Would that work? Of course, no, whatever Alice does, it doesn't invalidate the check Bob already has.
As for PoW, the value it adds is that a system normally converges towards consensus when economic incentives are aligned properly. It certainly makes history-rewriting harder. But if you take some dead SHA256D coin and use a modern miner on it, you can easily rewrite history starting from the genesis block.

When transaction fees go up, people will do payouts less frequently, aggregate transactions, start using off-chain payment methods, etc.
From my point of view, decentralized censorship resistant base layer **plus** an efficient off-chain transaction layer would make a strong infrastructure together.
If you try to combine both properties in one layer you get a shitty system.
Do you know how government subsidies create market distortions and inefficiencies?
It works the same way for Bitcoin, we would not observe real demand for advanced payment systems built on top of Bitcoin if we use block reward subsidy to pay for security and have no block size pressure.

Ethereum chaindata is already 10 GB even though it have barely seen any use. I don't know if it includes the whole blockchain or just the data Ethereum node needs to operate, but in any case it looks bad, as it's already ~~1/3~~ 1/6 of the Bitcoin blockchain.
For the reference, Bitcoin chainstate is 1.4 GB after 7 years of heavy use.
There's also a huge difference in how much block header data an SPV client will need to download, Ethereum is much more data-expensive in this respect.
Bitcoin is designed to be sustainable, it should be the currency which will last for 100 years or more.
Ethereum offers more features, but it quickly bloats itself. When all the apps using Ethereum will go live, they will generate gigabytes of data per day, and you'll need terabytes of RAM to run an Ethereum node.

You're confusing cause and effect. Mike Hearn divided the community by forcing it to vote on a contentious hard fork.
Bitcoin isn't supposed to be a democracy. Democracy is a "tyranny of the majority" kind of a system, where 51% can impose their will on 49%. It consistently produces shitty outcomes, e.g. George W. Bush was president of US for 8 years, being elected twice.
We have to resort to democracy to govern countries, as laws cannot be optional.
Bitcoin doesn't rely on democracy. Satoshi didn't ask anyone what hash function or digital signature scheme he should use, what issuance schedule they'll prefer, etc. He simply created it and gave it to people. It's up to people to decide whether to use it or not. Using Bitcoin implies agreement with all the design choices. Thus within a group of Bitcoin users we have nearly 100% agreement about the rules of the system, this voluntarism-based system is much better at producing consensus than democracy where a half of the group might disagree with the rules but are forced to obey them anyway.
People who didn't like Satoshi's choices but wanted to have some sort of a cryptocurrency created alt-coins. Litecoin, Monero, Ethereum, NXT, there's an alt-coin for every taste. Existence of alt-coins is a direct result of a voluntary nature of the system: people aren't forced to use Bitcoin, hence they might use other things.
But Mike Hearn apparently prefers democracy. Even if you don't see a fundamental problem with it, here's a simple proof that democracy might be harmful.
Suppose currently Bitcoin has 5 million users. Suppose one day US banks decide to embrace Bitcoin and give all their clients access to Bitcoin wallets via mobile banking app. (BTW Privatbank in Ukraine already has Bitcoin wallet in their mobile app, so that's not too far-fetched.) Thus Bitcoin user base grows to 50 million users, cool. But they need to comply with AML regulations, so they propose to enable system-wide censorship.
If Bitcoin was democracy-based, the original users will lose. We'll have 5 million votes to preserve censorship-resistance, and 45 million votes for AML compliance.
So that's what divided Bitcoin community. It's not about block size, it's about governance.

The core idea behind Bitcoin is that rational miners would not want to harm the network/currency they use, and thus as long as the majority of hashrate belongs to rational miners, Bitcoin will be OK.
The problem with it is that miners might optimize for short-term gains rather than long-term gains. And sometimes they just do not act rationally.
Sadly, there is no easy fix to it. Rationality is a fundamental assumption, and   a system which doesn't depend on it might require an entirely different design.
You aren't blaming the Devs for not inventing a better system, are you?
But appealing to GHASH/CEX.IO and to individual miners can be effective: we need to explain that they aren't acting rationally.
To summarize, if the system's security depends on rationality of participants, and participants aren't behaving rationally, it is not a technical problem.
I hope that eventually developers and researchers will design and implement a better protocol which is much less fragile. But that will take time.

The promise of colored coins is that
1. There is a global consensus about ownership of tokens, and it isn't affected by issuer's will.
2. It is always possible to send and trade these tokens, even against issuer's will.
We only offer transparent accounting system of sorts, but we cannot guarantee contract execution and things like that. It is obvious. Of course, we recognize this.
In case with a centralized solution like Open Transactions, issuer can (potentially) affect ownership records or shut down trading.
People say "but you need to trust issuer anyway", I don't think they understand what they are talking about.
For example, suppose company XYZ owes $1M USD. It defaults. Company ABC buys its debt 10 cents on dollar and gets $200K USD from liquidation.
Is this possible when ownership records and trading server is controlled by people who owe people money?
I don't think so, it's far too easy to simulate intrusion, technical malfunction... and avoid paying.

Not really, we had colored coins p2ptrade back in 2012. It had only one centralized component: messaging, but it can be trivially replaced.
A proof-of-concept version which used BitMessage for messaging appeared few months ago.
So if you look at the protocol, the difference is that it takes several blocks to execute Counterparty exchange transaction (because it uses Bitcoin blockchain as a messaging mechanism), while, on the other hand, it takes several seconds to execute a colored coins exchange transaction (provided that both users are online and have sufficiently fast messaging channel), and it's confirmed in the very next block without any further action.

Bitcoin is quite a bit like cash.
Suppose you have $20k in cash. Naturally, you need to keep them locked in a safe. You will use a private key to lock/unlock the safe. It should be unique, private (nobody else should have access to it), and safe's lock mechanism should be secure against lockpicking attempts.
So it makes sense to go to a reputable firm which sells safes.
But there is a company called "Easy Secure Safes" which offers safes which are very cheap, easy to install and to use. Naturally, you might want to acquire  a safe from it.
But there is a problem: these safes aren't really secure. There is no guarantee that nobody but you have access to the private key. Also in many cases locks are very suspectible to lock-picking.
Obviously, an average person cannot assess security of a safe, and thieves will have no problem stealing from such a safe.
Do you think that a company which offers "Easy Secure Safes" is liable? Or is it a problem with currency?
Back to Bitcoin, wallet is simply a collection of private keys. If keys aren't unique or can be guessed, bitcoins will be stolen. brainwallet.org makes it easy to generate really bad private keys, and has no warnings.

No, you don't.
1. If you are able to take hold which exist only on BU chain (somebody can offer such coins as a service) you can create a transaction which is valid only on BU chain. Moving corecoins is unnecessary.
2. If there is an exchange which supports both coins (and many exchanges indicated that they will), you don't need to split your coins, just send them to an exchange. They might arrive sooner on BU chain. It doesn't matter when they arrive on Core chain and whether that happens at all: you only care about BU coins getting confirmed to sell BU.
You can withdraw your bitcoins later, it's up to exchange to split them.

Yes. But the problem with most alt-coins is that they aren't as secure as Bitcoin, as they don't have Bitcoin PoW securing them.
Some alt-coins have user-issued assets as one of their main features. E.g. Ripple, Stellar, etc.
You can find a list of top traded assets here: 
Omni and Counterparty exist on Bitcoin blockchain (although I think Omni is going to move to Factom at some point, not sure about that).
NXT and BitShares are blockchains on their own. They are secured via proof-of-stake, that is, owners of those coins sign blocks.
Finally, there is a concept of private/federated blockchains, basically there is a pre-determined list of parties who sign blocks to secure the blockchain. Banks and financial institutions are keen on that concept.

I think the best example is that Satoshi Dice used to "spam" the network by making ~2 Bitcoin transactions for each bet: user bets with the first transaction, and Satosh Dice replies with another (they used to send 1 satoshi back even if user lost, to provide a feedback).
Of course, it's not really a spam, it was just an experiment in novelty UI: you only need a Bitcoin wallet to play Satoshi Dice, you don't even need a web site.
This was quite reasonable when fees were low. Now Satoshi Dice (and similar sites) work in a much more efficient way: you deposit money just once and then you can play many times.
Thus higher fees lead to better blockchain space utilization efficiency. Of course, it's usually a trade-off

There is no problem with blocks being full per se. Blocks normally should be full in some sense.

2. If you mine a &gt;1MB block by accident, your proxy node will kill it, so you still lose money.

Your understanding is correct, but you underestimate the incentives parties have. Stakes are high.
Particularly, for miners: they spent a lot of money on building datacenters full of expensive mining equipment. Diverging from the consensus puts that under a huge risk. Even if they manage to get some exchanges on board, an event like that might have a big negative impact on Bitcoin price, and thus miners' revenues.
Who will buy bitcoins knowing that miners can fuck them in arbitrary way?


That's true. What matters is number of users who use wallets connected to pre-change nodes.
E.g. consider a situation where 90% of nodes switched to new rules, but 99% of users keep using old wallets. We can say in this case that the fork is unsuccessful and majority of users ignores it. Meni Rosenfeld coined a term [economic majority](
But raw number of nodes matters to
 * SPV (thin) wallets: they rely on full nodes to validate blocks, thus it matters to what full nodes they are connected to; bigger number of correct nodes means that chances that thin wallets will get it right are higher
 * network stability/propagation times: large number of forked nodes can make the network slow and unstable

Firm fork was previously known as a "51% attack". The only difference is the intent: "51% attack" is understood to be malicious, while "firm fork" can be harmless or even positive. But it's inherently subjective: e.g. some people might claim that censorship is beneficial while others will see it as being malicious.


You don't need a hard fork for that, a soft fork will be enough as a soft fork can impose additional restrictions on blocks. For example, you might demand that a valid block needs to include transactions with at least XXX bitcoin-days-destroyed (BDD), so empty blocks won't be considered valid. Or you can make it more complex: you can allow empty blocks if their difficulty meets 2x target.
The problem is that "firm fork" miners might try to adapt to these soft forks (although with BDD it's quite a bit tricky). They can adapt to hard forks too, unless they change PoW function.
That's the nuclear option. It will make the "firm fork" miners irrelevant. Sadly it will also hurt the minority miners. And blockchain security might become a problem after this fork.
One option is to join other cryptocurrency via merged-mining, e.g. Litecoin. Another option is to switch to proof-of-stake (probably the best option in term of fairness, but there's still a debate whether PoS is secure enough).


I think it was inevitable. Previously we were concerned about external attackers (e.g. governments) trying to hurt Bitcoin, but now we are more concerned about different groups of Bitcoin users fighting with each other, and hence what was previously called "51% attack" becomes "firm fork".

Scarcity of tokens is important, but it's not directly linked to amount of work one has to do to create tokens.
A good example is game tokens like Rare Pepe, BitCrystals, Spells of Genesis cards. They are scarce and valuable, but they were created without any work. A work was put into marketing/game software, but it's not something you can quantify.
The point here is that economics (markets) is much more important than technology (hashcash, PoW) when it comes to value.
Interestingly, Szabo's bitgold had its value pegged to estimated cost of energy used to create them, using some complex mechanism. The Bitcoin approach -- all tokens are fungible and value is decided by the market -- is much more elegant and robust.

Is BitFury a pool or a miner?
The distinction between miners and pools is largely irrelevant, in the original paper Satoshi only mentioned miners as those who create blocks. He didn't described a weird scenario where those who own mining equipment will essentially rent it out to "pools", but this scenario becomes largely irrelevant now when equipment manufacturers have enough capital to mine themselves.


What actions can they take? 


On contrary, it might be a disadvantage for mining pools located _outside of_ China.
@_date: 2016-01-03 12:20:44


This is absolutely NOT true. Miners do not control the Bitcoin protocol.
If miners decide to increase block subsidy from 25 BTC to 50 BTC, nodes will simply ignore those blocks as invalid. Even if 99% of miners "vote" for this, it still won't matter.
In reality, **Bitcoin is governed by economic incentives**. It is similar to a system of checks and balances. Neither users nor miners can unilaterally change the Bitcoin protocol:
 * If miners change the protocol the use in a backward-incompatible ways, their coins won't be recognized by users, particularly they can't be traded on exchanges, and thus they'll be losing money (as they still have to pay for electricity).
 * If users change the protocol, they will no longer be protected by the hashpower, and might suffer from attacks.
Miners and users (which include merchants, exchanges, payment processors and ordinary users holding bitcoins) must cooperate with each other if they wish to change the protocol.


Exchanges like Coinbase have tremendous influence as they can control which coins are traded and thus which ones have value. It also represents millions of users.
I find it really sad that CEO of a large Bitcoin company is so clueless. It is pretty much Bitcoin 101. When somebody learns about Bitcoin, he asks "so it's controlled by miners?" and people explain that no, miners have to obey the rules just like everyone else.
Miners can do changes via soft-forks or change mempool policies, but they can't do hard forks by themselves.
@_date: 2016-01-26 13:58:04


Yes, it's possible, of course, but developers believe that "the economic risk of full blocks" is very minimal. It's, basically, an economic reality of a decentralized payment network rather than a risk. 
On the other hand, there is a real risk associated with a hard fork.
A secondary concern is that people will be much less motivated to accept complex solutions when they see that the problem can be "fixed" in an easy way.
@_date: 2016-01-14 08:56:14
You should learn basics before posting. 
It is all about a **hard fork** which is a backward-incompatible protocol changes. There were no such changes in the protocol so far. (May 2013 fork wasn't a hard fork, it was a bug in the old version.)
So it's not arbitrary. If client uses a hard-forked protocol, you shouldn't promote it. Simple, eh?
You can talk about alternative wallets and implementations: BitcoinJ, btcd, Armory, Electrum, they are all fine, as long as they implement the Bitcoin protocol correctly.

The cleanest solution would be sharding, that is, splitting whole blockchain into smaller pieces which can be independently validated. One possible approach is Peter Todd's Treechains.  Also Ethereum developers research sharding, and they got some good progress, it's on Ethereum roadmap now.

I'm not interested in an unstable coin with many different consensus rules which people can vote on. I don't think this can work at all, so if it comes to this, I'll just sell all bitcoins and switch to something else.
Also Satoshi himself wanted a stable system with stable rules: "The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime."


The majority dictating rules to minority isn't a menace. OK. Wow.


Again: you do not understand how BU works. There are only two parameters: EB and AD. They mean: "I will accept a block with size over EB only once it is at AD depth".
So it is simply impossible to limit blocks while still participating in emergent consensus. If you set your AD to infinity, then you don't really have an emergent consensus, but just hard block limit. And if your AD is less than infinity than you accept unlimited blocks.
By default, BU ships with AD=12. This makes EB parameter irrelevant. People can set it to 500KB, 1MB, 8MB, 100MB -- it won't matter what they set it to, in the end miners decide.
Do you expect the majority of people to set AD to infinity?

Roger Ver and Jihan Wu doesn't care about your begging. You gotta find a compelling reason for them. Users who want SegWit can get together and formulate a threat to:
1. sell all their bitcoins if SegWit isn't activated soon
2. assassinate Jihan Wu &amp; Roger Ver
3. DDoS their pools
4. activate UASF
OK, I'm afraid only UASF is morally acceptable. So how do you activate it?
It won't matter if Joe the Average activates UASF. We need important exchanges and payment processors to activate it.
Exchanges have been neutral for now. So miners are right to some extent: why activate SegWit when there is no demonstrable support among users?
Exchanges might not care much about the tech, but the care about customers. So **customers** gotta tell them what what want.
We need at least one exchange which supports SegWit. Then we need to threaten Coinbase, Bitstamp, etc. to move our business to exchanges which endorse SegWit.
If that's not enough, do the same with UASF.

Well, a bank should be able to lend money it gets on time deposits, as that's the whole point of time deposits: it is a loan to the bank, which can lend this money out.
With demand deposits it's not so clear, the main benefit for a client is not interest, but convenience.
There are different reserve requirements for time and demand deposits, so they can increase requirements for demand deposits only.

A second blockchain cannot just appear out of blue. It can be a result of a security breach (leaked private keys) or a collusion among entities which were supposed to safeguard it.
At that point system cannot continue to work as is. However, it shouldn't be a problem for humans to figure out which of copies is the right one.


I don't think that 'immutable' is the right term here. Every blockchain is immutable in the sense that every block hash rigidly defines a list of transactions none of which can be modified without altering said hash. So it should be trivial to detect corruption or tampering.
The property you have in mind is better described as tamper-proof or tamper-resistant. Blockchains are tamper-proof under certain assumptions.
For PoW that assumption is that economic incentives make creation of altered blockchains unprofitable, and that miners act in their best interest.
For proof-of-authority federated blockchain the assumption is that no more than N out of M authority nodes are vulnerable or collude.
For proof-of-stake the assumption is that it is in the best interested of stakeholders to maintain the blockchain in a healthy state AND it's possible to bootstrap a node in a safe manner.


Would you say that hijacking node of 10 largest banks is easier than hijacking 10 largest Bitcoin mining pools?
I don't these cases are comparable, they just have different assumptions.
And it's a matter of context. Would you say that Bitcoin which was at one point controlled by a single mining pool is inherently 'immutable' unlike some hypothetical ledger which is protected by 1000 independent universities around the world?

I'm quite certain most users will choose the fork which is supported by miners, as that's easy to justify. Especially if Coinbase CEO says that miners define the protocol.
If you think that every of millions of Bitcoin users is a cryptocurrency expert which knows which decision is better in the long term. They will just follow some well known authorities (like that Coinbase CEO guy, he can't be wrong, can he?), or pragmatically choose the safest (miner-supported) fork.

Bitcoin isn't flexible. It's quite limited and very conservative.


Absolutely. Probably the best example is Ethereum which allows scripts of arbitrary complexity.
It's certainly an attractive feature as it makes it much easier to make automatically-executed contracts, but it also adds overhead and complexity, so it makes sense to experiment with these features on a separate blockchain.
In theory, it's possible to implement a sidechain which will use Ethereum scripting with Bitcoin as a currency, but sidechain security is still being researched, it might be actually worse than that of an alt-coin.
It's also interesting to see experiments with alternative consensus mechanisms, such as proof-of-stake. Proof-of-stake has its problems, but it's potentially less centralization-prone than proof-of-work, and thus is interesting.
There are also cryptocurrencies which offer anonymity features. It is possible to add anonymity features to Bitcoin, but it's not clear which approach is the best, and alt-coins might offer empirical answer to that.
There are many other features, such as experimentation with name-value stores, governance, storage contracts and so on.
Alt-coins might also offer different trade-offs in terms of capacity, fees and security. For example, if Bitcoin fees are too high you might start using some alt-coin with lower fees. But as it's likely less secure, you can keep your savings in Bitcoin and only covert some smaller amounts of money to this alt-coin. This is kinda a free market solution to block size debate: we need a "gold standard" kind of a cryptocurrency, the safest and the most conservative, and Bitcoin is in the best position for that role.

I have rational reasons to be concerned about Blockstream:
1. A single company which employs many Core developers _by definition_ centralizes development. They cannot be as unbiased as independent developers. Even if they had best intentions to found this company, it's still reckless to do it. If anything, simply because it rises a question about a conflict of interest and feeds conspiracy theories.
2. I believe that mined sidechains are a seriously misguided attempt, and if implemented it might have a significant negative impact on Bitcoin security. But since Blockstream employs many of Core developers, we are unlikely to get a completely impartial analysis of sidechain security, since these people now have vested interest in making them a reality, and thus are biased.
However, I'm myself not a part of any group, particularly I'm not a fan of XT/Classic hard fork. I mostly agree with Core developers, but still think it was really a bad idea to found Blockstream. (I mean it's bad for Bitcoin. Perhaps it's a fantastic deal for them personally, as they get stable salary and whatnot.)
I don't know if there's an actual conspiracy against Blockstream. It looks more like an actual disagreement about vision followed by "holy wars"/tribalism/ego etc.
On the other hand, a lot of money are at stake, so somebody might use existing conflict to advance his interests. (Banks, big Bitcoin startup, miners, governments...)

It's absolutely NOT the same fractional reserve phenomenon. Banks always have enough assets to cover liabilities, they just don't have cash at hand.
E.g. here's how bank's balance sheet might look like:
  * Assets:
  * $10 billion loans (people owing to the bank)
  * $1 billion cash and money in the central bank
  * Liabilities:
  * $10 billion deposits (money bank owes to people)
  * Equity:
  * $1 billion (this is bank's value to shareholders)
But MtGox and Cryptsy don't have assets to cover all their liabilities, calling this "fractional reserve" is wrong.
How is it called then?
Bankrupt. That's the proper term.
If bank has $10 billion in liabilities, but only $7 billion in assets, it's bankrupt, and regulator will close it ASAP.

Fee is exactly 0.1 BTC, but transaction size varies a lot, so fee rate is random.

@_date: 2017-02-19 20:34:43
Some things in that article are wrong. 
The "output total amount" can be much higher than the total coin supply because a block can include multiple transactions involving same coins.
E.g. suppose you have 1000 BTC and want to send 1 BTC, you create a transaction with two outputs: 1 BTC and 999 BTC. Then maybe you want to send 1 BTC to a different guy, so you take 999 BTC output and split it into 1 BTC and 998 BTC. At this point "output total amount" is 1997 BTC. If you repeat this 1000 times then total output amount will be around 500000 BTC. But de-facto you just split your 1000 BTC into 1000 1 BTC outputs in a very inefficient way. But that's your right.
I hope at this point you also understand what is a "magic shuffle". It's just an ordinary transaction sent out of a wallet with many coins in one output. If you send your coins one by one (instead of using `sendmany`i.e. a multi-output transaction) you get that picture. There is nothing magic about it, there is a lot of that stuff in Bitcoin blockchain as well.

@_date: 2017-03-15 08:18:18
What's interesting is that these people consider BU hashpower to be centrally controlled.
It is impossible to do this kind of an attack in a fully decentralized (each miner thinks for themselves) environment. Let's say Antpool contributes its hashpower to Core attack, but some other pool doesn't. In this case Antpool loses a lot of money.
This is same as prisoner's dilemma -- even if it is profitable to perform an attack when all pools contribute 15% of hashpower, each individual pool can maximize its payoff by not contributing it. So it won't work without centralized control.
So what's scary is that BU people and consider BU hashpower being a cartel and have zero problems with it. 
Now if you are OK with a cartel of miners, can you remind why do we need mining at all? Just use a supermajority vote to decide the next block, no needs to waste electricity.

Bitcoin isn't a business. it is an unique project to create decentralized money, not controlled by anyone. That's the goal, and it's really hard to achieve it. 
Initially, Bitcoin was mined by ordinary people, and it was very decentralized. But as network grew, people realized that centralization increases efficiency. So now maybe 10 large mining pools control Bitcoin.
Increasing number of transactions per second will further increase pressure to centralize.

 * If everybody agrees (BOTH users and miners), they can change it (in [hard fork]( sense), by running a version of software which implements the new protocol.
 * If almost everybody agrees, they still can do it. Imagine there is a single grumpy users who isn't willing to update. He might no longer able to spend his bitcoins, but it hardly matters, he won't prevent others from updating. Likewise, a single maverick exchange or a miner won't matter much either. He will only disadvantage himself.
 * Further, people introduce a concept of [economic majority]( but it's not precisely defined, as it's hard to calculate influence each participant has. But the general idea is that if the majority really wants it, they can make it happen.

People are now trying to make cryptocurrencies with more features than Bitcoin, but they are much more experimental. They have to go through multiple hard forks etc.
So Bitcoin is uniquely positioned to be "an independent backbone store of value".

Yep. It's essentially another form of a bribe attack, which is less risky for the attacker, but more risky for miners. Thus not necessarily cheaper. (If there risk for miners they need a good motivation, it will cost you an extra; but in the rent-based attack I described miners get their money regardless, so you only need to pay a little on top of normal rewards.)

`AD=12` is a clever ploy to make it look like users are in control.
In reality this parameter means "how deep you want to be fucked?".
`AD=1` is the safest setting, i.e. you just accept whatever miners mine.  Does somebody really think he can punish miners by not looking at their block for some time?!
Of course, `AD=infinity`, which is the current behavior, is even better. But numbers between 1 and infinity are strictly inferior on the users' side.

Withholding blocks / delaying propagation maximizes profits of sufficient large miners.  So it **is** profitable to act adversarially towards smaller miners.

Let's consider two options: 
1. We have two layers: miners and off-chain companies.
2. There is a single layer: miners.
In the first case, if off-chain company is misbehaving, you can withdraw your money and move to move if to other off-chain company. And these off-chain companies will never touch your life's savings, as you can store them directly in a Bitcoin wallet.
But in the second case, if miners go bad, then that's it. There is no recourse.
There is NO need to use a global trustless decentralized consensus to buy coffee, this isn't a problem we're trying to solve. There is no problem with it. Optimizing for this case is just insane.

If you don't want to spend years studying distributed computing and cryptography before you get to blockchains, the best option is probably to get a decent overview, and then dive deeper into each individual topic.
You can try _Mastering Bitcoin_ book for an overview. It's mostly about Bitcoin tech, but it also covers general concepts and cryptocurrency/blockchain ecosystem as a whole. (I haven't read the book myself, just heard about it.)
Then once you read to get into specific topics, you can get an overview from wikipedia and then find in-depth academic papers or textbooks. (FYI academic papers can be quite accessible if you read only introductory sections and conclusions; there's no  need to read theorem proofs and things like that.)
Byzantine fault tolerance is distributed computing topic. There's a lot of material about it, but it's not particularly relevant for understanding Bitcoin. [State machine replication]( is a good overview on pre-Bitcoin approaches to distributed computing.
Cryptocurrency-specific topics such as PoW and PoS are closer to bleeding edge, and thus you might find significant disagreement between different authors. For example, Gregory Maxwell and Andrew Poelstra [have "proven"]( that "Distributed Consensus from Proof of Stake is Impossible", yet there's a number of PoS-based alt-coins, as well as academic articles about PoS, etc.
Another controversial topic is selfish mining. Game-theoretic aspects of PoW are far from trivial, and there are some indications that Bitcoin is much less stable than people think it is. However, Bitcoin experts such as Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn argue that these game-theoretic concerns are nearly irrelevant and we'll be better off focusing on high-level assumptions.

People who believe that both subs are toxic/echo chambers must also believe that "my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge".

You cannot just assume that the one who screams louder is right. And you cannot assume that one who looks calm is right. Truth is not defined by the exhibited emotions.
People who focus on tone/appearance and ignore the substance simply demonstrate their ignorance, and they should be just ignored.
(Just to clarify, there is no such thing as a right opinion on scaling debate in general; BUT there are objective facts about BU/SegWit/conspiracies, etc.)

"Emergent consensus" means that miners can dictate block size. EB and AD parameters are essentially just consensus theatre, in practice nodes will accept bigger blocks if miners want that.
So big miners will be able to create big blocks. Big blocks disproportionately benefit big, well-connect miners.
So eventually almost all mining will be done in facilities in China. At that point it's very easy for Chinese government to request them to add censorship, etc.
Basically at that point those miners are just a trusted third party, which is the problem which Bitcoin was trying to solve.


It's not a problem when blocks are small. If they will be bigger they can easily overwhelm your machine.

They hope they can win and Bitcoin won't be killed. Bitcoin will die as an independent, decentralized currency, but most know won't know the difference.
Very few people actually have in-depth understanding of security, game-theory (cryptoeconomics), etc. People can be easily fooled.
If you show that your coin has 10000 nodes, 15 different pools, some people might think it's truly decentralized.
Now, of course, hard-fork-war isn't about convincing some random people, it is a very complex process. Behaviour of early adopters might be a very important factor, as they might dump coins of the side of the fork they don't like.
Unless Jihan Wu is bluffing, he estimates that he will win. But he might be using flawed data. Particularly, he might be wrong about early adopters.
In early days, Bitcoin was especially popular among libertarian/nerd/cypherpunk crowd. I don't think Jihan Wu has a good information on them.
He might see that some of early adopters, such as Roger Ver and Olivier Janssens support BU and don't mind China. 
But there are people who prefer to stay anonymous and aren't very vocal, and those people won't like China-controlled Bitcoin.

Well, some of us understood that Bitcoin has limitations and is not a competitor of credit cards. Other people didn't.
Now people who didn't understand the limitations come to understand them through practice. So, yes, there is a chance in sentiment, as people become more realistic.
When I read the Bitcoin paper back in 2010, I understood that, as a payment system, it is more of a competitor to international bank wire payments (SWIFT) than a competitor to credit takes: if it normally takes 1 hour to confirm a payment. It is still better than "SWIFT" both in terms of confirmation time and cost of transaction.
But since most people in US associate money with credit cards (yikes), people tried to see how Bitcoin can replace credit cards. If merchant accepts zero-confirmation payment, you can use that, but it is not very reliable, and you aren't really using the security of Bitcoin blockchain. Also, if you get your salary in USD, it is worse in terms of fees because you gotta convert USD to bitcoins first.
I understand that not everyone can understand technical characteristics of Bitcoin, but it is not good when people who lack understanding are pushing their vision.

So to get a better understanding of the magnitude of 1/2^160 we bring into a conversation another number which is even harder to understand... It just makes no sense.
Suppose p1 is a probability of winning a lottery and p2 is a probability of finding an address collision for one specific address. OP found a solution for `p1 / N = p2` while he should have solved `p1 ^ N = p2`. This is a simple brainfart and you don't need complex theories to justify it.

But you missed the whole point of Bitcoin. Why do you think you aren't missing it now?
As people say, it's possible to make a credit-card-like system on top of a decentralized one. We don't need that in the core layers. On the other hand, if system is optimized for credit card-like usage, it might be impossible to build a decentralized system on top of it.
So what should we optimize for: decentralization or scalability?

This isn't a new idea. Moreover, it was done years ago.
Open Transactions is the oldest "private blockchain", in the sense that it allows people to transaction in cryptographically secure and auditable way, but is centralized. Add an ability to deposit/withdraw bitcoins and you get an off-chain transaction system. IIRC some people set it up this way back in 2012, but somehow it never got popular...
There is also a "voting pool" feature for Open Transactions which further reduces risk: withdraw requires signatures from multiple independent parties which will audit records before signing.

How long will it take until you realize there is a tradeoff between throughput and security?
Nobody says that high fees is a good thing (by itself). Nobody says that low throughput is a good thing.
But when choosing between high throughput and high security (reliability, decentralization, ...) it seems like high security is more important.
There is a plenty of high throughput system systems, but there are no systems which match Bitcoin properties in terms of security, robustness and decentralization. So it seems that it's more important to preserve those properties than to maintain affordability of Bitcoin transactions.

Now people also described a "firm fork" as a semi-friendly variant of 51% attack where miners who have a majority can coerce others to adopt their rules, as otherwise they face DoS attack which can be defeated only by hard fork.
So fundamentals were never particularly strong.
There were proposals to combine proof-of-work with proof-of-stake to strengthen the system, but apparently people don't find this issue important enough.

Transactions are stored in the blockchain as usual. This just gives you an ability to add constraints on future transactions which try to spend those coins.
E.g. I can give you a coin which you will only spend a week later. This transaction will be included in the blockchain, but your transaction, if you happen to make it, can only be included after a week. Of course, you can just wait with making your transaction.
With relative lock-time transactions the condition might be "a week after this transaction is included in the blockchain".
@_date: 2016-01-03 16:34:46


Yes. Thus "majority hash power" does NOT win. When miners will notice that hardware they paid millions of dollars for is now worthless, they will learn their lesson. On the other hand users can continue with the forked blockchain, and it might end up being even more secure than before. Thus users win and miners lose.


Uh, users can choose what protocol to use, that's as direct as it gets. But they cannot change the protocol on their own.

Yes, could work in theory at least, but I'm not sure how practical this is. It requires some active participation from miners/users, so it's hard to analyze.

You want _unconfirmed_ transactions to be irreversible, this makes no sense.
We should focus on features which make confirmations faster, ideally instantaneous. There are many proposals.
But currently 0-conf security is based on miners' mempool policy which is not consensus-enforced. Miners can adopt "full RBF" at any time, and nobody can prevent from doing that. There are many big mining operations which have enough resources to implement changes on their own without even asking Core developers.
"Opt-in RBF" which is being merged now is actually safe compared to "full RBF" in the sense that merchants have a warning.
Sane merchants won't just trust any transaction (as it's possible to double-spend without RBF), they will check _confidence_ (as provided by BlockCypher API, for example), so "opt-in RBF" changes nothing: confidence will be zero for transactions which opt-in, and merchants who do things properly already know how to deal with it.

@_date: 2016-03-08 09:31:13


No. If we ignore block propagation delays, marginal costs of adding a transaction are essentially zero, as capacity is already paid for. We have a [tragedy of commons]( kind of a situation: while it's in interest of miners to cap total number of transactions, each individual miner has no motivation to cap his own blocks if he can earn an extra.
Another things to consider is that miners can afford to buy high-end hardware, since they earn money on it. Basically if you're going to get many millions in revenue, spending $10k on node hardware is a no-brainer.
But for the vast majority of users the need to buy expensive hardware to be able to keep up with the blockchain will be too much. In this case Bitcoin will cease being peer-to-peer system, as users will have no option but to connect to supernodes.
Currently block propagation delay is the biggest factor which limits block size, as a bigger block is more likely to be orphaned. But that can be optimized using approaches like thin blocks, marginal cost of extra data can be very close to zero if miners cooperate with each other.
Thus removing a block size limit is a bad idea. It won't have any effect right now, but in future it will allow Bitcoin to morph into a miner-controlled system as ordinary people will have no chance to participate.

As long as BU chain remains functional, you can dump BU coins on exchanges. Also, if you don't mind the risk, you can put your coins on exchange before the fork starts.
I think it's the most effective weapon. If BTU price goes down to zero, it will be a pretty damn clear signal that the market doesn't want it.

I don't know what is "KRS", but I think you've got it wrong. This approach is based on multisig: you hold one key, service has another. Both signatures are required to spend coin.
You can't spend coins when the service is down, that sucks. However, service cannot spend coins on its own. Also it's possible to implement an automatic return when the service is permanently down.
So again, on user's side it's 100% secure and trustless.

There is already a plurality of implementations. There is a plenty of wallets. We also have a number of full node implementations, e.g. btcd, Haskcoin, libbitcoin.
But we should all use the same consensus protocol. If we don't use the same protocol, we won't have consensus. That's the whole point of Bitcoin: we can achieve consensus by using the same protocol.
Web browsers implement same HTML spec, by the way. But of course adherence to the spec isn't as critical in case of HTML: getting some bad layout isn't as bad as losing money.

Pretty much all exchanges mentioned that they will list both coins in case of a fork. They don't want to "lend credibility" to any of sides, they want the market to decide (and make money on that, LOL).
But that was before UASF. It's hard to say what miners will do in case of UASF. Thus consider three scenarios:
1. All exchanges list only Core coins. Then BU coins are worthless, as they can't be sold.
2. There are exchanges which list both coins. Then people can dump BU coins and buy Core coins.
3. All exchanges list only BU coins. Then hardcore Core supporters can still dump BU coins, hoping Core coin will be listed later.
In all three scenarios there is a possibility that BU price will crash.
I think realistically there will be at least one exchange for both of coins. You know, if there is a profit to be made, why would people skip it? So in case of a fork most likely it will be resolved through coin market voting.
What's interesting, it is actually unsafe to buy BU coins at any price. It won't be like ETH/ETC split where ETC became an independent coin with lower market cap. If BU price crashes, miners will abandon it, and it will disappear. So if it will look like the price is crashing, speculators will dump it too. There is no floor for BU.

**EDIT: Just to clarify, in this comment I'm just giving an example how using a loaded language one can accuse other companies, such as Blockstream, of doing bad stuff. I do not claim that Blockstream did any bad stuff. My main point is that _payment_ doesn't make things nefarious (by itself).**
Some people who write BIPs are on Blockstream's salary. There is even less transparency than in case of BUIPs, which makes it worse.
BUIPs are a shit show, but you can't deny the fact that Blockstream covertly "pays shills" (aka "has employees").
"Shill" is a loaded word. There are people who receive money for working on BU. There are people who receive money for working on Core. Blockstream -- probably -- sponsors events and covers expenses. This is same shit, really.
The difference is that BU is seemingly open about sums of money it pays, while Blockstream isn't.
The funny thing about BUIPs is that they do not separate technical stuff from propaganda, but it's just a funny thing and not some fundamental difference.

There was a period of miners voting before that. It wasn't automatic like BIP9, but same idea. So I would say it is more like "manual BIP9" than UASF.

It's an anti-spam measure.
The blockchain is ~60 GB now, but if it was 100% utilized all the time the size would be ~400 GB. Thus it would be much more problematic for an average person to run a full node.
If transactions were essentially free people could use blockchain to store arbitrary data. Like torrents, messages, announcements etc.
Note that besides the blockchain size there's also UTXO set size, and it's much more important because every node should maintain the UTXO set, ideally keeping it in memory.
The easiest way to store data in the blockchain is to send it to fake addresses which actually represent this data. This method was used by the first Mastercoin protocol.
So think about it: without this anti-spam measure every node would need to store 300 GB of junk in memory, forever.

 There are many ways to make a "weird" transaction aside from RBF. Easiest is probably with dust threshold: it's different in different wallets, so it's possible that sender's wallet doesn't consider change output to be dust, but receiver's does. So what happens next?
People should use a proper payment protocol instead of just sending to an address, and payment protocol should allow receiver to validate transaction before publishing it. This sorts out all possible issues, not just RBF.

What's about the other side of the debate?
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:41:04
IMHO the most important thing is to develop mechanisms which will allow people to sell BU coins in trustless and anonymous way.
Sending coins to exchanges is dangerous, de-anonymizing and might have negative tax consequences.
Sadly, I don't think "atomic cross-chain swap" is going to work, as it requires finite confirmation times on both chains, which cannot be guaranteed.
Payment channels/multi-sig escrow could work, but it not fully trustless.
Perhaps the best option is to enable conversion of BU to ETH via BTCrelay. This can be done in a trustless manner. But for this to work, we need people to arbitrage. (E.g. USD -&gt; ETH -&gt; BU -&gt; USD.)
And if we can show how many coins are going to be dumped that might actually prevent the fork. There is vote.bitcoin.com but people do not take it seriously.

"Just use a hardware wallet" seriously sounds like a cargo cult to me.
A hardware wallet can help you if your computer is infected with malware. That's nice. But how do you make sure that the hardware wallet itself has no malware? It's basically the perfect place to put bitcoin-stealing code into.
Open source firmware can solve this issue. Almost. If you build firmware yourself from audited source code chances of it having malware are very minimal. But... How do you make sure that your hardware wallet uses firmware you uploaded but not some secret firmware hidden on some chip?
So hardware wallet aren't inherently better than paper/brain wallets _if_ one follows best practices when doing such.

If your node is not economically significant (i.e. you do not accept payments), it is economically irrelevant. And so miners can safely ignore it.


Yes, but each node enforces it for itself. Again, if you are not economically significant, miners do not need to care what your node enforces. For all intents and purposes you're just a lone freak.
If you can get every node to enforce it, then sure, you can force miners to change the protocol. But how do you do that?
In practice, it would be enough if 95% of merchants accept SegWit-Bitcoin, then mining non-Segwit-Bitcoin will be uneconomical.

Everybody wants both. But a trade-off is necessary for technical reasons.
Having microtransactions _on chain_ means that blocks will be big, and running trustless full nodes _will_ be expensive, and thus inaccessible to many people.
Running a full node is important for one's financial privacy. If you run a node which downloads complete blocks, you do not leak information about your wallet structure.
If you run a thin node, you query only specific stuff, and things you query leaks your wallet structure. It becomes much easier for others your different financial activities, e.g. coins you bought from exchange, coins you got from others, you spends will appear related.
So you gotta choose whether you value privacy or cheap transactions. Wishful thinking isn't going to help.

BU ideas about consensus are just as bad as their code, _if not worse_.
Do you want Core devs to work on these bad ideas?
Core devs work together on the code.
And also there is a group of people who have inferior skills, but sky-high ego. So they write shitty code full of shitty ideas.
So how do you think Core devs should accommodate these people?
Fighting them would be unproductive, so they just ignore them and focus on writing code.
Nobody fights with BU, it fights with itself.
Note that improvements which are done to Core could in theory be ported to BU with minimal effort. However, BU people did many unnecessary edits which made this porting much harder.
And BTW Bitcoin Core includes _Compact Blocks_ feature which is actually superior to Xthin, so Xthin is totally unnecessary, it was implemented just for political reasons.

@_date: 2016-01-19 10:13:50


Well it depends on how much you want to increase it.
If you increase it to 2 MB, it certainly won't result in network collapse. Everyone, including Core developers, agrees that it can be done and is quite safe if certain precautions are taken. But the question is: hould we do that? It doesn't seem to be an urgent matter. A soft fork can alleviate immediate pressure and is a safer/better otion.
If you want to increase it to 1 GB (1000x fold), then you have a real issue. Few people will be able to run full nodes, so Bitcoin will be entirely controlled by few businesses. It will cease being "peer-to-peer cash", it will no longer be trustless.
Smaller increases are possible, but they don't solve the fundamental issue. The debate is essentially between two point of views:
1. OMG we are about to hit the limit within the year! Sky is falling! We don't be able to onboard new users! Won't be able to go to the moon! Increase the limit ASAP, like next month!
2. Block sizes are growing naturally, but it's not a huge issue, as people can adjust their spending habits, stop making unnecessary transactions, etc. Let's see how Bitcoin works under the pressure, let's get an incentive to develop off-chain transaction systems, let the fee market develop so we can get a clue of how Bitcoin can be secured in future.
So one group of people is focused on immediate growth (like, this year), while the other is more interested in long-term vision.
Bitcoin Classic 2 MB hard fork doesn't help much, it's mostly to demonstrate that something is done/can be done. And this is exactly why Core developers are against it: they are against going through a hard fork just for a demo.

"Miners" isn't a fixed set of people, anybody can mine. If nobody mines then the old protocol will be dead, yes. But if change is controversial, somebody will start mining on the old fork and it will be kept alive. (There are ordinary people who own mining equipment, if the wish they can organize their own pool, or use p2pool, or solo-mine.)
Another option is to do a hard fork, switching to a different hash function or to PoS algorithm.
Suppose Bitcoin forks into two cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin-A keeps SHA256^2 hash algorithm but illegally increases block subsidy. Bitcoin-B keeps the subsidy schedule, but switches to proof-of-stake algorithm. Which one can call itself Bitcoin?
I'd say the one which is accepted by merchants and has non-negligible exchange rate. It doesn't matter what algorithm is used, what matters is which fork inherits Bitcoin's economic power and mindshare.
We the users can easily make miners irrelevant by switching away from PoW algorithm their hardware users, all their hardware will become worthless in that case. This is what Bitcoin is: peer-to-peer cash. Peers themselves define what to accept, they define the protocol. Bitcoin is governed neither by miners nor by corporations, it is governed by users.

People experimented with this kind of things, and in fact there is a suitable oracle:  (Note that it exists since 2013, so it's not a new concept at all.)
There is also more elaborate software to do this kind of smart contracts: [Veritaseum]( formely known as Reggie Middleton's Ultracoin.
I don't know why it's not more popular. Possibly:
 * people do not trust this software (IIRC Reggie Middleton didn't open source his stuff, which is ridiculous)
 * software is not convenient enough (technically you can make a contract using bitcoin-cli, but it's PITA)
 * people do not trust oracles
 * there is no interest
 * peer-to-peer contracts are too inconvenient (you need a liquidity provider to make it smooth)
 * people do not see benefits over centralized solutions (you need to trust an oracle anyway...)
E.g. suppose we have nice software which works in a browser, or a mobile app. Suppose Alice wants to bet on some event (buy a binary option). Now she needs a counterparty to do that, Bob.

Without significant liquidity (a lot of people making contracts in different directions matching each other) it will be slow and awkward.

The capacity problem was well-known from the start. In fact some people were skeptical even before Bitcoin was launched. It's the fundamental issue with Bitcoin.
EVERY node needs to validate EVERY transaction.
Current limit is arbitrary. We can increase it 10x without much bad consequences. But if you expect billions of people to use Bitcoin daily, we need at least 10000x capacity increase, and that's a problem: at that point ordinary people won't be able to run Bitcoin nodes, only corporations will be able to. It will no longer be peer-to-peer cash it was meant to be.
So what do we do about it?
There are essentially two camps:
1. Let's do more research! -- There are some promising ideas which can potentially let us to increase capacity million times.
2. Fix the shit ASAP! -- People are concerned about rising fees and want capacity to be increased immediately without any complex developments.
Most developers are in camp  They don't see issues with fees rising from $0.01 to $0.02 per transaction and want more time for research and optimization.
Most users(?) are in camp  They don't care much about technical limitations and trade-offs, they want transactions to be fast and cheap.
Ideally we should solve the core issue: "EVERY node needs to validate EVERY transaction." It seems to be possible, there are several realistic proposals. But it will take several years to research and implement them. So the question is: what do we do in the meantime?

I don't think it's an abuse if you're trading assets for Bitcoin.
E.g. suppose I want to buy shares of some company for Bitcoin. Let's consider three scenarios:
1. Trusted third party: I send bitcoins to a trusted third party, it waits until shares transferred, then sends bitcoins to seller. This requires two on-chain transaction, say, 300 bytes each, thus 600 bytes total.
2. 2-of-3 multisig: buyer sends bitcoins to 2-of-3 multisig address, waits for shares to be transferred, then buyer and seller sign a transfer sending bitcoins to seller. Multisig transaction is larger than ordinary, so that would be 500 bytes.
3. If shares are represented as colored coins, buyer and seller can do atomic trade, that would be 500 bytes.
So the colored coin option doesn't require extra space compared to other realistic scenarios, but it has multiple benefits: 1) no need for a trusted third party; 2) no edge cases or counterparty risk; 3) no need for a separate share registry.
There's no extra burden on the blockchain, and it's a case where public blockchain shines, yet people think it's abuse, somehow.
FYI banks (who obviously already have all kinds of SQL databases, have trust relationships, etc) are looking how to optimize post-trade settlement using blockchains, as stuff they use now is messy and inefficient. (E.g. see bottom of page 17 and on [here]( 


The question is whether having them on blockchain improves security. And answer is "yes".
There is a number of possible attack scenarios which can be mitigated by making share registry public i.e. putting it into a blockchain.
It doesn't need to be on the Bitcoin blockchain. If shares don't need to be tradeable for bitcoins then there are virtually no benefits of using the Bitcoin blockchain.
However, I think it would be good for Bitcoin if will be a preferred medium of exchange in some equity markets. At least it makes more sense than using Bitcoin to buy coffee.
You know, people already figured out how to buy coffee quickly and efficiently without Bitcoin; but private equity transactions are often slow and daunting.

This is **blatantly false**. Core developers say that Bitcoin works only as long as users &amp; miners agree on a certain common consensus rules. For this reason, it is advised to run clients which are consensus-compatible with the reference client.
This is my no means a new recommendation. It was first formulated by Satoshi: 


This is the very design of Bitcoin. Are you going to disagree with Satoshi on this?
This was later reiterated and elaborated by Mike Hearn and pretty much everyone who understands how Bitcoin works.
"Alternative clients" you mentioned here is an euphemism used by Bitcoin Classic proponents to make it look like switching to Classic isn't a big deal. 
You can find the actual alternative clients here:  
Many of them were written from scratch in a different language, so they are actual alternative clients.


A person who encourages use of clients with incompatible consensus rules wishes death to Bitcoin, as it cannot function in such conditions. See above:


Which part of it you fail to understand?
Are you an alt-coin pumper who wants Bitcoin to burn why you take profit?


There is no "developer centralization". Core is an **open** open-source project. Absolutely anybody can contribute, and there is no "center".
On top of that, there are many alternative clients. You're talking about developer centralization because you don't know how development is done.


I never said that, I'm saying that one particular proposal, which is called "emergent consensus" is very flawed.


What you fail to understand is that "Devs" is a large, open group of people. It is, basically, all people who have technical knowledge and desire to work on Bitcoin.
So: "people with technical knowledge who work on Bitcoin" narrow down choices. Is that a bad thing?
Bitcoin cannot function when choices are not narrowed down. So somehow has to do it. Why not people with technical knowledge?


By all means, you can code it yourself. For example, UASF isn't endorsed by Core developers.


You do not understand how BU works. With default settings AD=12 means that a node will accept miner's block with ~2 hours.
This means that users have no say, whatsoever. The block size is fully controlled by miners. If miners choose to make 100 MB blocks, users will have to accept them.
Technically, you can set AD to a very high value, but that basically puts you on a minority fork. Bad idea.


Bitcoin isn't meant to be a direct democracy kind of a system. Satoshi didn't ask people what hash function they want, what supply schedule they want, etc.
He designed the whole system, completely by himself, and invited people who use it. People who start using it accept the rules.
And again: system works only as long as the overwhelming majority of users &amp; miners are on the same rules. If people just start tweaking rules randomly, the system will fall apart into a myriad of forks.
So tweaking rules **should** be hard, there **should** be a lot of interia which forces users &amp; miners to gravitate to the same set of rules. 


Users, miners and developers are not disjoint sets. Users who are technically competent can also function as developers. Same with miners, they can, for example, higher competent people to work on the implementation.
Your question is, basically, "I'm technically illiterate, why am I not allowed to vote?". Well, if you do not understand security, why should your opinion on security matters matter?
If you allow Joe the average to vote, he will vote for low fees &amp; good UX, and then cry that somehow his coins are hacked.
A good example is Falkvinge, he now demands that fees should be low: 
This is the guy who didn't understand how to back up private keys, so he kept coins on MtGox (!!!) because he thought it is somehow more secure, and he have lost quite a few of them.

I understand problems with convenience sampling, but you are a bit too dogmatic about it. The fact that the sample might be biased doesn't mean that it's entirely useless.
Mathematically, the data is useless only if variables are independent.

Well, the idea is that in future everyone will have a Bitcoin wallet with Lightning support, so you will typically give your Lightning-enabled address to the other party, and wallets will process the payment via Lightning.
So from user's perspective it is more-or-less the same as with normal Bitcoin addresses, except both wallets need Lightning support.
However, the problem is that Lightning payments is nowhere as foolproof and reliable as normal Bitcoin transactions. If Bitcoin transaction is confirmed, it's confirmed. You no longer need to care about it. But in the case with Lightning, normally you'll keep money within the channel, and you need to care whether the channel counterparty is alive, what liquidity it has, etc.

It takes 2016 blocks, might be more than 2 weeks.
But hashpower isn't a static thing. If people will dump BU coins on exchanges its exchange rate will fall, and miners will be forced to switch to protect their profits. (If BU exchange rate falls, it will cost them money to mine BU.)
Do you think miners will still mine BU if its price falls to $10?
This can be decided very quickly, practically as soon as exchanges list two coins.
Ironically, a coin with smaller hashrate will be in a better position as it takes more time to dump it. :)

The reason for memory sizes being power-of-2 is that
 * there might be more than one chip on board
 * hardware needs to know which chip corresponds to which address
 * with power-of-2 chip sizes this can be done without any arithmetic operations, i.e. much faster and cheaper
If sizes weren't power-of-2, you'd need much more complex circuitry to route memory requests to chips.
Now, none of this reasoning applies to anything except memory sizes.
E.g. the stuff ethernet is doing isn't in any way related to a problem of routing memory requests to memory chips. So they just picked a nice round number: 10BASE, 100BASE, 1000BASE.
For other standards they picked a number which makes sense for technical reasons, which again have nothing to do with power-of-2.

It is actually possible to change PoW with a soft-fork: you simply require a normal Bitcoin block to include other work proofs.
I.e. if fork activates, a block will be invalid unless it includes scrypt PoW in addition to normal PoW. This is probably safer than a hard fork.

This is decided entirely by miners. Users have no say, whatsoever. If miners decide increase block size, they will at a certain date increase EB. (See Jihan Wu's post above, he calls that "the best practice of EC".) User's behavior cannot, in any way, affect this, since it's up to miners to decide whether to build on top of bigger blocks. 
And if the majority of miners decide to keep blocks small, they will just do that. Again, users have no say. Only miners do.
EB/AD are completely meaningless on end user nodes, these settings are meaningful only for miners.


How would they even know what users think?! Few users run full nodes. (For every user who runs a full node there will be a thousand of those who just use light/custodial wallets and won't mind bigger blocks.) Also full nodes can be Sybil-ized. The only nodes who matter are nodes who belong to people/businesses who accept payments, especially exchanges and payment processors. 
Are you going to say that block size is going to be decided by internet polls? LOL.


Um, yeah, except right now nodes reject bigger blocks by default, but with BU they will accept big blocks by default. So if user installes **Bitcoin Unlimited** then he signifies his willingness to accept blocks of **unlimited** size.

The main problem with BU is that so-called "emergent consensus" is very different from normal Bitcoin consensus and is much more fragile.
Normal Bitcoin consensus is designed to be fully automatic, it is "fire &amp; forget" kind of a thing. As such, it is very robust. And it can tolerate a lot of things, e.g. miners not giving a fuck about updates, etc.
On the other hand, BU emergent consensus requires miners to 
1. actively decide on configuration options
2. be honest and/or concerned about long-term future of Bitcoin 
As such, it is **much** more fragile than Bitcoin.
You're essentially replacing a mathematical process of Bitcoin with a "board of governors" process of the Fed.


There are numerous article written about BU consensus shortcomings. If you want an independent expert opinion, I  am such an expert: I never contributed anything to Core and co-authored several academic papers on cryptocurrency consensus.
The fact that BU code is poorly written isn't a huge concern. They can improve the code by hiring experts. I'm sure miners can afford it. But they cannot change BU's main point.


Who can be such a third party? Would you care about my opinion, for example?
Do you want somebody who has no prior exposure to cryptocurrencies?
I can tell you that a person who doesn't understand specifics of security/crypto/cryptocurrency software won't understand what's so bad about BU code.
Even people who worked on crypto software might not understand the importance of consensus, i.e. that all nodes need to work "in lockstep", as Satoshi once said. This stuff is largely specific to cryptocurrencies.

And in 2150 when all bitcoins are mined the price of bitcoin won't be in any way linked to PoW.

As far as I know, IsStandard validates spending tx inputs, thus your spending transaction with non-standard script won't be propagated/confirmed.
But I'm not sure what exactly you try to accomplish by that anyway. The main limitation of Script is that it only has access to data within single input and output and cannot inspect transaction as a whole, thus it cannot be used to do "interesting" stuff like enforcing certain distribution and whatnot.
If you want something dependent on external state you can try using 'oracle' approach using multi-sig.
Also once SegWit is adopted it will be possible to create contracts as transaction trees.

If attacker isn't able to more than 50% of the total hashrate, then what matters is **number** of confirmations, not the amount of work done on them. This can be mathematically proven, and was actually proven by Meni Rosenfeld. Please read the paper I linked above.
This comes from the fact that attacker competes with the legitimate network, and as long as his hashpower is less than 50%, he's more likely to lose than to win. And number of blocks amplifies this effect.
If attacker is able to recruit more than 50% of the total hashrate, then time matters in the sense that it's more expensive to rent hashrate for larger amounts of time, as, for example, energy expenditures are proportional to amount of time spent on mining.
So, in theory, if inter-block interval was very small (e.g. 1 block per minute), one could rent a supercomputer for several minutes to do a double-spend reorg.
1. Supercomputers are irrelevant for mining, as ASICs beat them.
2. Services like Amazon only rent computing power at 1 hour granularity.
Which means that this scenario is impractical. Which brings us back to the fact that **the only thing that matters is then number of blocks.**
And what if an attacker has more than 50% of total hashrate on a permanent basis (i.e. he owns ASICs)? Well, he can do anything. It doesn't matter if there are 1000 blocks a minute or 1 block each 10 minutes, he can do a reorg if he wishes so.

You're confusing soft forks and hard forks. Soft forks are enabled by miners' vote. Bitcoin.org doesn't have a policy about soft forks, as far as I know.
Hard fork isn't done through voting, everybody must upgrade for it to be safe. So it's OK to do a hard fork only after everybody's on board.

BU is based on an idea that miners know what is better for Bitcoin. If BU becomes mainstream, people have no choice but to accept that. If miners will be allowed to control other parameters, why not inflation rate?
People associated with BU also spread the myth of "Nakamoto consensus": the chain with most work is the _real_ Bitcoin. This helps them with pushing the block size hard fork, but it can also be used to push any other hard fork.

Why do you think so? For the start, did you read Meni Rosenfeld's [Analysis of Hashrate-Based Double Spending](
If we assume that attacker isn't able to get more than 50% of total hashrate, but has certain fixed hashrate. From that you can calculate attack success rate, which depends _only_ on number of confirmations. Inter-block time isn't a parameter. Furthermore, it's possible to calculate break-even for a given block reward.
Time might appear if you consider a more complex model (e.g. attacker doesn't own mining equipment and has to rent it, and cost of that depends on time), but it's obvious that time isn't a fundamental parameter which affects Bitcoin security if Bitcoin works as advertised.
If you own 20% of total hashpower, probability of generating 6 blocks in a row is 0.2^6. It doesn't mater if interblock time is 1 minute or 10 minutes, probability is the same. It doesn't matter how many joules or exahashes you're spending on this, what matters is only your hashpower _relative_ to others. A network with smaller interblock times can figure this out faster.
OK, now what if attacker is able to get more than 50% of total hashrate? In that case we're fucked: attack is risk-free, attacker will be able to collect _both_ block rewards and whatever profit he gets from double-spending.
But what if attacker is able to get more than 50% of total hashrate, but only for a limited amount of time? OK then, if you explicitly add time to the model, it will matter.
But this kind of an attack is irrelevant now. It was relevant in early days of Bitcoin, when mining was done on CPUs and GPUs. In that case an attacker with deep pockets could rent a lot of CPU and GPU power from a cloud service provider and pwn the network overpowering everyone else. It might be cheaper to rent resources for 10 minutes than for 1 hour, thus time matters in this case.
But now mining is done on specialized devices, and all hardware which can be useful for mining is used for mining. Even if you have a lot of money, you cannot rent 1 exahash for 10 minutes. It just physically doesn't exist.
Hence only attacks discussed in Rosenfeld's paper actually matter now, and time doesn't matter. But dilettantes like you are stuck with old mentality of "computational resources". Please stop making up bullshit and start reading papers. This all was figured out years ago, 
@_date: 2017-02-08 13:59:34


Well, for starters, how do you know that miners will do verification at all? If it's an extra work to do miners might just skip it. Even if you get a reward for finding a cheater, if probability of cheating is low then the expected value of reward is also very low, so rational miners will skip the check.
Then, what's about SPV clients?


[Classic proof-of-activity]( doesn't "work like this", but it can be modified to incorporate something like "proof of nodework".
It is discussed in section 3.2.2 of the paper as a possible extension of the base protocol: 


UTXO set from a signature of the block, and requiring the resulting hash to meet a certain PoW difficulty.
Thus, if the Nth stakeholder does not have the UTXO set, she will need to spend an impractical amount of
communication to create the wrapped block. This form of Proof of UTXO is quite energy efficient, as the
required PoW difficulty can be very mild.
"UTXO set queries" would be a third layer of protection in PoA, so DoS is impossible and SPV clients can simply skip these checks.

More like they want to seize control, but yes, that destroys Bitcoin. Plenty of evidence:
1. Bitcoin XT: Core devs were willing to compromise on hard fork just to avoid community split, but Hearn wanted it to be resolved by miners' vote. He also openly said that he will be the lead developer if the fork is successful, and he will fire Core devs who disagree with him. The fork wasn't successful, so Mike went away.
2. Bitcoin Classic: Their plan was to pass a largely uncontroversial "just the tip!" hard fork (pretty much everyone agrees Bitcoin can handle 2 MB block). Of course, this block size increase is largely meaningless, however, thus the actual goal is to show that hard forks are nothing to be afraid of, so more hard forks can be done in future. This becomes evident when you look at the other stuff associated with Classic community: community governance tools, Olivier Janssens talking about how consensus parameters should be tweakable by users, through some voting process or some such. Clearly it wasn't about block size increase, but about overhaul of governance, i.e. replacing Core developers. This clever ploy didn't work very well, so was abandoned in the end. (Also it is hard to advocate 2 MB HF when SegWit offers 2 MB block size increase without a HF.)
3. Bitcoin Unlimited: It outright just puts miners in control of the block size limit, there isn't much subtlety about it. Moreover, it lacks voting mechanism on the protocol level, so voting needs to be done out-of-band, i.e. a council of miners will decide on a block size. Some miners like it, and they mentioned that perhaps it would be cool if other consensus parameters will be governed by "emergent consensus" aka "the council of miners".
So all three projects were about a change in governance. They were never about block size per so, it's just a very convenient wedge issue to get support for the governance shift.

Well, for the start it will be good to get SegWit to get a relatively small size bump quickly, and observe the data (how does the network react to size increase?).
Then a simple exponential growth proposal like that of Luke-jr or Pieter Wuille would be a good start. Small constant makes sure that there will be no huge unexpected growth and if somebody goes awry, we have time to react.
Dynamic block size would be cool, but it requires more research. It's kinda pointless to talk about it because it will be controversial.
I always liked solutions where a miner is penalized for making a bigger block (e.g. it requires higher difficulty or yields lower subsidy). But in any case, there should be an upper limit, as a miner can mine a huge-ass block as a form of DoS.


It doesn't matter what his role conceptually is.
You should think in terms of a data structure: a miner can make a valid block of any size if he wants to. To do so, he will just produce data which looks like valid transactions. That's the objective reality of it.
So if miners can drive their competitors out of business by creating, say, 1 GB blocks, there is a possibility that they will do that.

Huh? Terabytes aren't available for free online.
Amazon Simple Storage Service, a very popular wholesale storage service used by many businesses, costs $30/month for 1 terabyte. $360 per year is far from a trivial cost.
It's true that there are services which offer maybe 10 GB for free, but if you need more (e.g. you want to backup your photos, videos, etc.), that doesn't help.

If you are doing anything security-related, positive thinking is a **bad** idea.
For example, if you don't know if some cryptographic construct is broken or not, you should assume it's broken.
If your computer was left unattended, and your private key _might_ be compromised, you should assume it **was** compromised.
If you working with something which is important, you should always look at what is the worst case. Because if things turn out to be bad, you've already lost, you can no longer fix the situation.
E.g. suppose you have 1000 BTC in an unencrypted wallet on Windows PC. You believe that it's pretty secure because you use Kaspersky Antivirus, but you get hacked and your bitcoins are lost. You can't got back in time and buy a Trezor. Your bitcoins are gone. No matter how much you invest into security and how careful you are, your bitcoins are already gone.
So if it is possible that Jihan Wu is influenced by the government, you **should** assume that he is.
This is a common problem with BU supporters: they think that Bitcoin is kinda like startup, and startups take risks. But the thing is, there are thousands of startups, and very few of them become successful. There is only one Bitcoin.

I think the very first version of GLBSE (which was the first "Bitcoin stock exchange") was open source, at least partially, and also the most impressive on the tech side (with crypto-based authentication and everything).
But it was quickly discontinued, and all other exchange were closed-source. I don't think it affects the quality of assets, though.
When I started working on the colored coins projects in 2012, the main motivation was to create a decentralized, unregulated stock exchange. It was the time when GLBSE was closed, so it felt like there is a need in decentralized exchanges.
Obviously, it would be very easy to create scam assets on the decentralized exchange, but the hope was that eventually the community will establish standards for verification and reporting, which would ameliorate the problem.
However, this year I got completely disillusioned in unregulated stock markets seeing so many failures. The last one was NEO&amp;BEE. It was very visible and public, was endorsed by reputable people in the community, generated a lot of press, run ads on TV. They even talked with Cyprus government.
And, it turned out to be a complete scam. So, apparently, visibility doesn't help.
I don't want to discourage you, though, perhaps it would work for creative projects. (Although you have a lot of competition, e.g. [MyPowers]( [Swarm]( etc.)
I would recommend you to study the history of Bitcoin "stock exchanges". Perhaps you would notice that mandatory rewards will definitely not improve the quality of assets.
You see, if somebody can get 100 BTC and pay out 50 BTC, it is totally worth it: you get 50 BTC for doing nothing. 
You know what, I would be glad to get 100 BTC and pay out 10% per year (10 BTC  per year) to make people happy. And in 5 years I will tell people "Oh, sorry, my business failed to reach profitability. But you got nice dividend for 5 years, just leave me alone". Obviously, I don't need to run any business, I'll just get 50 BTC out of it.
So when you claim that mandatory rewards help to a history of trust, you're only helping scammers who can do the math. It is a bad idea.
And, yes, there is a plenty of examples of Bitcoin stock issuers who pay dividends for several months (or years) and then disappear or go dormant.
Perhaps the most striking example is [BASIC-MINING]( For the first 8 months it was an exemplary project: it paid dividends on time, met all investor expectations, communicated with investors on forums, posted photos and screenshots. And then when it was announced that btct.co is closing, that guy just disappeared. People later found his real name, and evidence that he was a scammer before this endeavor.
So I'd say early dividends are more like a red flag. Sure, you might recover 50% of your initial investment, but if you're guaranteed to lose 50%, it's a bad idea to invest. I don't think successful projects pay dividends just for shits and giggles.

It's OK to _want_ system capacity to handle the next rush. Like "It would be cool if we can handle it".
But changing system characteristics just because you want to handle the next rush is short-sighted. System should be optimized for long-term viability, not your short-term wants.
If increasing capacity isn't harmful, sure, let's increase it. In fact I think it gets ~2x boost next month.


It's a norm for market-based systems. Normally everything which is produced is sold.
You seem to be confusing your "wants" with technical capabilities of a system.
Overfishing would be a good example. People want salmon, it's fucking delicious. Fishermen might catch more salmon, perhaps making it as cheap as herring, to satisfy the demand. More people will be able to afford salmon, that's great, right?
But next year there will be much less salmon to be caught. That's why there are fishing quotas, regulations, etc.: to make it more sustainable.
Now if you say that Bitcoin actually has technical capacity to meet all the demand during the rush that's another story. That would be a technical argument, and for technical arguments I'd prefer academic papers over musings of some dude on reddit, sorry.

Bitcoin is good enough for alt-coin traders. Despite a hard fork risk/uncertainty, Bitcoin is still more stable and secure than most (all?) alts.
Basically people have different tolerance for risk. People who want crypto but do not want high risk stayed in BTC, but now the perceived advantage of BTC is decreasing due to the anticipated HF risk.
So if Bitcoin is a shitshow just like alt-coins why not trade some alts?

If an attacker can rent &gt;50% of total hashpower, in theory he can do a double-spend attack at no cost: he will get block rewards of a secretly-mined chain, and that should be more-or-less enough to pay for rented hashpower. Thus it's kinda impossible to quantify Bitcoin security.
One way to mitigate this problem is to allow transactions to refer to a recent block which must be in the blockchain for a transaction to be included. This will make it impossible for a secret chain to collect full block rewards, as transactions cannot refer to it, as it is a secret one. E.g. consider this scenario:
    /-S1-S2-S3-S4-
    --B1-B2-B3-B4-
Currently, secret blocks S1..S4 can include same transactions as B1..B4. But with the aforementioned modification, a person submitting a transaction after block B2 is mined will include a B2 hash, and thus B3 might have a transaction which blocks S3-S4 cannot have.
Obviously, this scheme works with block reward which comes from transaction fees and doesn't work with block subsidy.

That's not necessary unless you introduce a new feature or a consensus-critical change. You just write code and ask maintainers to merge it (pull request).
For backward-compatible changes (soft forks) [the "version bits"  mechanism]( is recommended now, as it makes forks quite safe. Previously something similar was used.

I think it's already clear that Bitcoin is useful as a store of value. The debate is whether Bitcoin can be used for day-to-day transactions.

It fixes malleability in a backward-compatible way, so old clients can still understand transactions. But since signatures aren't part of transaction anymore, they do not count towards the size limit old clients are seeing. So it's not convoluted, it's just a natural consequence of segregated witness design.


Uh, what? EC has NO coordination protocol. None whatsoever.
The only thing it does is basically a provision: "If it looks like the majority agreed to increase the block size, I will agree to that limit". But if miner uses AD=12 then he might lose ~2 hours of his work if he didn't have a memo.
So the actual coordination must be done elsewhere (as was implied by Jihan Wu etc), EC simply makes the minority to agree with the majority (if they participate in EC).


What do you mean? Bitcoin miners do not need to coordinate block size, they simply work under the pre-agreed limit.

Here's a block just mined by Slush pool: 
Last transaction in it: 
It pays 0.0000226 BTC, which is is less than 1 cent. I don't know why you have to pay 10 cents, really.


Demand for making transactions is elastic. Currently transactions are cheap, so people do micropayments directly on the blockchain. If they will be more expensive, people will either do transactions less often (e.g. things like daily payouts), or use micropayment solutions built _on top_ of the blockchain. They will transact less often.
And we aren't at max capacity yet, average block size is around 0.7 MB now, we have some room to grow. With SegWit soft fork which will go live this year max capacity will be increased by 70% or so. So we'll be comfortably below max capacity for a couple of years.

Yes. The sidechains paper describes strengthening through which a larger percentage of hashpower will be required for a successful attack, but still, there is always a threshold.
It's different from Bitcoin 51% attack because Bitcoin miners can only double-spend, but sidechain miners can actually steal money they don't own.


Yea, actually the bigger concern is that sidechains will destabilize Bitcoin from game-theoretic perspective.
We expect mining to be highly competitive in future, operating on razor-thin margins, with residual value of equipment being negligible after equipment have been in use for years.
Merged-mined sidechains will give them an opportunity to steal a fuckton of bitcoins with pretty much no effort, all the need is to collude.They can actually soft-fork Bitcoin main chain to increase their chances of success.
So the main problem with merged-mined sidechains is that they drastically increase an incentive of collusion.
Note that collusion is actually required for a merged-mined sidechain launch: such a sidechain can't be secure until a significant fraction of miners starts mining it.

The design used in EVM is not the only one, and likely not the best one.
E.g. contract interactions can be implemented using asynchronous calls instead of synchronous ones. This will be just as powerful in the sense you can implement everything with, but it eliminates a possibility of "recursive call attack": If function completes before the sent message is processed, nobody can intercept a contract in a broken state. In other word, all state changes will be atomic and correct as long as functions leave state in a correct state.
We can compare the current EVM model to ordinary object oriented programming, while one with asynchronous calls will be more like communicating networked services. And it seems like people have figured out how to secure networked services, while a security within an object system (i.e. protecting one objects from other objects) is a new field.
@_date: 2016-06-21 06:15:32
Perhaps because you still want determinism and atomicity. Calls might look asynchronous from the point of view of calling code, but in practice they will be linearized.
Whether to see this a "same VM" or multiple synchronized VMs is more of a philosophical question.
The current EVM model might be also interpreted as message-passing between different VMs with one interesting property that somebody might call you while you're making a call. It is possible to implement this behavior in a networked service, but usually it's considered undesirable.

This focuses too much on recursion and glosses over the fundamental difference between models.
Bitcoin Script is executed in a context of a single input-output pair. It can never affect other outputs. (As long as the interpreter is implemented correctly.)
Thus fundamentally you can only screw yourself.
Ethereum is different, it allows scripts to call each other, thus it is possible to write a script which will screw others.

Loops and Turing-completeness are NOT important.
The important thing is that Bitcoin Script only checks whether a signature is valid. It cannot "do" anything: it cannot call other contracts, it cannot write values, etc.
It has access to a small amount of information: the signature and a transaction hash. (And, soon, transaction lock time and sequence numbers.)
Loops do not matter if you limit number of operations performed by a script. It doesn't matter if there is a loop doing 1000 operations or there is a script which does 1000 operations. The result is the same.
Even a complex script cannot do any damage if it cannot interact with other scripts. It either validates or it doesn't.

That's what NiceHash does, it just offers you a raw hashpower and you can do anything you want with it, like mine on any chain etc. That's the whole point.


Yeah, but apparently some miners don't see a problem with multipools and "rent-a-hash" pools like NiceHash. 


I believe that miners with nearly-obsolete hardware won't have any reservations. Basically their hardware is already worthless so they might be eager to get something out of it while it lasts.

You're doing it wrong in both cases. Running Electrum isn't a high-risk activity you want to protect your computer from. It's the opposite: you want to protect Electrum from your normal activity like browsing web etc.
Thus restricting Electrum's account is pointless, but browsing the web from a restricted account might be beneficial.
So back to the question of VirtualBox vs different accounts:
1. Running Electrum in a VirtualBox is a security-through-obscurity, essentially you just make it a bit harder for an attacker to do stuff, but in the end it changes nothing.
2. If you run different activities in different non-admin accounts, in theory they should be protected against each other. In practice, though, that's not always the case.
There are, essentially, two kinds of problems:
1. Local privilege escalations, e.g. user process getting admin privilege. I believe on a fully patched Ubuntu it shouldn't be a huge issue, but with GUI stuff you never know, the attack surface is huge.
2. Sloppy file permissions, e.g. by default different users can read each others' files in Ubuntu.
If you make your Electrum user directory unreadable for other users you should be OK in theory. But if you're holding a lot of bitcoins consider using paper wallets/booting from livecd etc.

The concept was rather vague from the start, and it's even more vague now after many people tried to develop their own vision and linked it back to the concept of a smart contract.
So it can be both an incremental improvement and something new entirely.
But even incremental improvements can lead to drastic changes. In principle, you can do any business-related computations with just pen and papers. When mechanical calculators were introduced, they were just a relatively minor optimization which allowed businesses to employ fewer people and get more accurate results quickly. But more complex computing machines enabled further automation, and that essentially changed how businesses are structured, make decisions, etc.
Same thing with automobiles: is an automobile just a better horse?
So even basic forms of cryptocurrency smart contracts might have a large impact. E.g. 2-of-3 multisig enables dispute mediation with some interesting properties: it's free when buyer &amp; seller are in agreement. That can potentially undermine centralized dispute mediation providers such as eBay, PayPal and credit card companies and enable more decentralized trade.
Smart contracts which are "something new entirely" are probably more complex ones, like DAOs/dapps and so on. You might say that the problem they are trying to solve isn't really a problem. 
But that is true for all kinds of new things. Say, Twitter. In theory, it's similar to mailing lists, newsgroups, RSS feeds. In practice, it's more convenient than these things and has its own niche.

This is NOT enough. Miners will receive transactions at different times, thus even if they follow exactly the same rules, their state might get out of sync.

@_date: 2016-06-05 10:57:58


Hmm, can you elaborate? I know there is fedepeg sidechain software, but is it used in practice?


In case of 'pegged merged-mined sidechains', main chain bitcoins are released upon a reception of a PoW-based proof. (Blockstream people call it an 'SPV proof', but that's misleading terminology.) So miners can just create a PoW proof which will unlock coins to send them to themselves, as simple as that.
Normally it should work like that:
1. Alice has some coins on a sidechain.
2. She creates a special withdraw-to-main-chain transaction which gets included into a sidechain block.
3. Sidechain miners then create many blocks on top of that one.
4. Alice now takes 1) her transaction; 2) an evidence that it was included in a sidechain block; and 3) sidechain block headers which prove that enough work was done on top of it; and post that on the Bitcoin blockchain. 
5. Bitcoin miners verify that conditions are met and give coins to Alice.
But note that Bitcoin miners cannot verify that Alice had a legit claim for those coins. The only non-trivial thing they verify is that enough block headers with the right difficulty were created. So colluding miners can just create a fake transaction, fake block and create enough headers.

The consensus is ALWAYS between humans. Humans decide what code to run. Computers simply automate synchronization once humans have decided on rules. But humans can, in theory, change the rules.
This is how all cryptocurrencies work. Bitcoin is not different.
Bitcoin blocks were rolled back twice. This was done without permanent changes, but still, human decisions can change blockchain data.

SHA-256 does 64 mixing rounds. This number is a trade-off between speed and security.
Full SHA-256 isn't broken yet, but there are published theoretical attacks on "reduced strength" SHA-256. The best one can attack 52 rounds of SHA-256, i.e. 52 rounds of mixing do not result in a perfect diffusion.
SHA-256 applied twice is roughly equivalent to SHA-256 with 128 rounds, so you have much better security margin.

It depends only on the hash being signed. If you accidentally create the same transaction, the signature will be identical, so it's not a problem (the whole transaction is identical thus attacker will learn nothing new).
If the transaction is different, then K will be different no matter what snapshot you use.

Actually Bitcoin had a lot of "unnecessary" features when originally released:
 * UTXO model instead of account-based model. It makes wallets an order of magnitude more complex.
 * Input/output scripts instead of simple signature checks.
 * Transaction replacement logic.
Complex scripts and transaction replacement logic were not used by the original client, it was only able to do simple transactions. So it was definitely "over-engineered". Without these things we could have a much simpler system, perhaps 2-3 times less code.

We are discussing a concrete hard fork proposal called "segwit2x", which is define by "btc1" working group, guided by experts such as Jeff Garzik, Sergio Demian Lerner, etc. This proposal is already implemented and finalized. You know, the fork is scheduled in 3 months, so there isn't much time for discussion.
You can find the specification here: 
It seems you're proposing some additions to it. In that case, please direct them to btc1/segwit2x working group. I doubt they'll incorporate your changes, though, since the fork activates in few months, so there isn't much time for more review, testing and validation of proposed changes.


Max block weight is already 4 MB after SegWit activation. Maybe you should learn how it works before making proposals.
Also note that SegWit was carefully designed to have only one limit. This is needed to make mining simple and efficient.
If you have just one limit, to make a block you just sort transactions by fee rate (fee divided by weight) and add them until you exceed the block weight.
With two limits, you have two different fee rates. Now finding a set of transactions which maximize the reward collected by a miner is NP hard optimization problem (AFAIK).
This might not matter much now, as miners might resort to using a simple heuristic, but in future all miners reward will come from fees, and this optimization will matter a lot.
Now you basically advocating adding another limit and making Bitcoin more complex, just so we have have a rushed hard fork. Why not wait a bit and see if there is a better way to do it?
Why not make slow growth over time like proposed by Pieter Wuille?

This is not quite true. Consensus-defined limit is better than no limit at all, as without a limit a blockchain can be easily forked. (If we assume that miners aren't using Turing machines but some physical hardware which has some practical limitations, each miner will have an effective limit, which is different for each miner. So if an attacker can mine a block with a size between effective limits of different miners he can fork the network. (There are some possible variations, e.g. suppose that all miners have effective limit above 1 GB, but many nodes cannot handle blocks bigger than 100 MB, then one can try to fork those nodes off.)

As I mentioned, reward is much bigger. Profiting from a 51% attack on Bitcoin isn't so simple, double-spending is pretty much the only way to do that (aside from exotic ones involving derivatives).
On the other hand, an attack on a sidechain will give you all bitcoins contained in it. Potentially, a very large amount.
Basically, right now there is no bounty for a 51% attack: it's very hard to predict whether it will be predictable.
With a sidechain, though, we'll have a concrete, large bounty for collusion/attack.

That's just how math works. Imagine there is a super-awesome sidechain with smart contracts, 1 second confirmations and all kinds of nice features you can dream of. It's so good 10% of all bitcoins are moved to it.
Now miners have a dilemma: they can either continue collecting 0.5 BTC per block in fees on that sidechain, OR steal 1 million BTC right away. Can you guess which choice is more profitable?

OK suppose that miner A gets transaction X before miner B. Then it will become "10 minutes old" for miner A before it becomes 10 minute old for miner B.
Another possibility is that a miner A will get a transaction X1 which is incompatible with X2, and miner B will get X2 which is incompatible with X1. So their mempool will be out of sync. This can happen when somebody tries to double-spend.
Maybe you should try to learn something about distributed systems. Getting things in sync **is** a hard problem, and this is why we have proof-of-work. Solving it without PoW is very much non-trivial.

Suppose that 40% of miners set block size limit to 100 MB, while the rest have this limit above 100 MB. Then a block with size higher than 100 MB will fragment the network: miners who support blocks bigger than 100 MB will start mining on top of it, while the rest of miners will be on a minority chain.
Now the thing is, there is no such thing as "unlimited" when it comes to real hardware, each computer has its limit.

LOL, no, holders don't pay any bills.
People who buy bitcoins pay those bills, indirectly.
There is no good way to compare PoW to PoS in this respect, as PoS doesn't solve the initial distribution problem by itself. 
For example, one way to introduce a PoS coin is to give all coins to the founder, that's what NXT did. In this case, you don't have to pay for energy bills BUT you have to pay the founder.
In any case I don't think it makes sense to complain about expenses.

This makes no sense. A short squeeze happens when somebody is _forced_ to buy an asset at any price.
So who is _forced_ to buy bitcoins?
I don't think that miners will be forced to do that, so they can't be a part of a 'short squeeze'. 
So far I've seen zero evidence for a short squeeze.
I believe that a massive price action is possible if/when big investors will get dissatisfied with fiat currencies and will start to buy bitcoins. There might be a shortage of bitcoins as few people are going to sell, but it's not exactly a short squeeze.

Greenhouse gases do not block infrared radiation, they absorb it, thus heating up.
Sun emits not only infrared, but also ultraviolet and visible light. That gets absorbed by Earth surface. However, Earth surface emits only infrared light.
So if you have gases which absorb and emit infrared light, but are transparent to other parts of the spectrum, they increase the surface temperature, as surface still receives solar radiation, but outgoing radiation is slowed down by these gases.
Of course, you still have an equilibrium, i.e. total amount of radiation which comes in equals total amount which goes out, but this equilibrium happens at higher surface temperature.

1. Fee depends on how many payments your received. You essentially pay a fee for each payment you receive.
2. Fees are 4x more than usual now, if you aren't in hurry you should wait the weekend, usually it's less busy then.
E.g. current fee is 400 satoshi/byte, on weekend it might drop down to 10 satoshi/byte, that's 40x lower.

Why? It doesn't violate any fundamental rules as mathematically trades are balanced.
However, it can only work as long as the price is in a certain pre-defined range. So they probably have a clause in ToS, like "We peg bitcoins to dollars as long as Bitcoin price doesn't fall more than 70% per day".
Another potential problem (I did something very similar to these CFDs back in 2011 so I researched this topic) is that traders might refuse to sign a settlement transaction. That can be solved by requiring them to pre-sign a transaction sending funds to Abra, so in the worse case (keys are lost) Abra will get the funds and do the settlement itself.
I don't think there is a fundamental problem with these CFDs, as long as Abra acts as a semi-trusted party and there are no huge price swings.
But I'm skeptical about it for a different reasons: Who are these "long term Bitcoin holders"? Are they OK with doubling their Bitcoin exposure/risk?

Well that's not a CFD then, it's some bs. If Bitcoin holders cannot lose money, they do not "take the other side of the trade".
So basically we have conflicting information from CEO.


My guess is that (1) Abra itself takes a risk, using investors' money as collateral; (2) they hope that price movements will "average out" over a long term.
The story about magical CFDs is just to hide the fact that the company itself is gambling.

Bitcoin is also supposed to change the world for the better by giving people a reliable currency which cannot be inflated at the will of a government, cannot be seized, reversed, censored etc. 
It might sound trivial, but billions of people on Earth have to rely on banks and national currencies which are anything but reliable. They can lose a half of their value in a year due to inflation, depriving people of the value they stored. Banks fail all the time. Money transfers are slow, expensive and unreliable. 
This might sound less sexy than apps, but  as someone who suffered from inflation, bank failures and bad payment systems, I think it's very important.
Guess what, we discuss Bitcoin properties over here. For example, this post highlights irreversibility of transfers. 
Of course, it's not going to be boring "Bitcoin payments are irreversible". "Yes, I agree". "It's a very important feature, indeed."
No, you know, after we spent 5 years discussing same stuff we look more into connecting this property to the recent events. Sorry if you got butthurt about it.
And if you believe that having a reliable currency is less important than Turing-complete arbitrary code execution contracts, you really belong to Ethereum community.

The thing about anchoring is that it’s very cheap to add it, but it’s very expensive to defeat (if implemented properly). So adding it “for redundancy” is a good idea.
Publishing a hash in a public blockchain is very different from publishing it in a newspaper: blockchain-published hashes can be continuously and automatically monitored, while with newspaper-published ones you’ll have to rely on manual processes.
You can never have 100% security. Even if you follow the best practices, use hardware security modules etc, some freak accident can happen. For example, if all your nodes use the same HSM device, they might all be compromised at the same time. So additional security never hurts.
Software breaches are often zero-cost, in the sense that all they take is hacker’s labor or some rogue employee to hijack servers.
But anchoring is different: it’s impossible to rewrite Bitcoin blockchain history without spending money (on the scale of hundreds of millions now).
So it’s orthogonal to other security mechanisms and strictly adds to security.

The possibility of oscillations was known for years (since 2012 or so), they routinely happen with alt-coins which share PoW. Alt-coins have well-known and well-understood counter measures, such as fast difficulty adjustment time.
Even shittiest alt-coins which are Bitcoin copycats have this mitigating mechanism.


It is definitely malevolent. Bcash was endorsed by major miners like ViaBTC and Bitmain. They are definitely more sophisticated than random alt-coin dev team, they are miners, so they understand difficulty, etc.
Imagine hundred million dollar business doing a mistake which is obvious to a university freshman. Is it accidental? No.


You're missing one thing: it is good to miners, since Bcash peculiar difficulty adjustment mechanism boosts their profit.
So an alt-coin which was endorsed by miners have a weird quirk which boosts miners' profit? Yeah totally just an accident, it's not like miners have their own analytics team, and it's not like this problem is easily preventable. (Just copy difficulty adjustment algo from an alt-coin.)
Note that the fact that there is a backlog on Bitcoin side is **also** very profitable to miners: they get as much as 5 BTC in fees per block, that's a nice 40% boost to block reward. It essentially doubles their profits, not bad, huh? This little quirk earns miners something like a billion dollars per year.
It's also possible that miners wanted to push Bitcoin into hard-fork. Now this problem exists. It can be solved by adjustment to a difficulty computation algorithm. How convenient that we have a hard fork scheduled in November, perhaps we could fix this issue by bundling oscillation-resistant difficulty adjustment?
Again, the problem was **widely** known, Bcash code was reviewed by many teams. There is no possibility that it's accidental.

Let's consider an example. Suppose you live in a village where there is no money, no government, no taxes or anything. The entire world is just a single village with 100 people in it, and you live off agriculture.
When somebody gets sick, he gets no healthcare and dies. That's not cool.
So people think like "We have surplus of beets and potatoes, but we are not happy because we get sick. Maybe we can get a doctor somehow?".
So one guy volunteers to be a doctor. He needs some time to acquire doctor skill. But he is concerned that he might starve. So he says: "I'll be a doctor and heal you guys, but if you agree to share your produce with me, like 1% of produce".
So if you grow 100 kg potatoes, you give 1 kg to a doctor. Even you are not sick.
Now suppose everyone agrees to this scheme, except one guy, let's call him relemhcs. He doesn't want to share. So people say: "Hey relemhcs, don't be a dick. We decided we all gotta share with doctor. If you don't share, others might think it's optional too, and doctor will starve, and we won't have our free healthcare. You know, if you want to be a selfish dick, we will just take your produce whether you want it or not".
I see where you're coming from: it might be considered immoral to take private property from a person.
But a morality of the whole village is that healthcare is provided and that people share. So it's not immoral if you consider it this way.


It's not unsustainable. You just share a fraction of what you produce. What's the problem with it?

didn't mention SI prefixes, so I have no idea what you mean.
Are you advocating direct use of metric prefixes? That's not going to work because millibitcoins and microbitcoins are too long to pronounce. 
Another problem is that micro- is shortened to μ. People don't know how to type Greek letter mu. They will try to shorten it to m to much confusion. Or to _u_ which isn't quite correct (if you're so anal about international standards).
People will definitely try to find a shorter pronunciation for millitbitcoins and microbitcoins. Microfarads are often called _mics_ (pronounced as _mikes_), so that's one option: to call microbitcoins mics.
So anyway, if we need a shorter words, why not bits?
The point of SI is to standardize base units and use of decimal system. It doesn't forbid us to make aliases. 
So I have no idea why do you think bits somehow conflict with SI.

There is a fundamental problem with PoW-based decentralized 2-way peg: once it is deployed, a 51% attack will allow miner(s) to steal an amount of bitcoins which is _much larger_ than normal block rewards. So, basically, if you do this, you undermine Bitcoin security, as you create an enormous incentive for a 51% attack.
This isn't something which can be "fixed/implemented", it's likely a provable conjecture that any PoW-based system will be vulnerable to this.
Non-PoW-based peg is theoretically possible, but it's going to be much more complex than Bitcoin, so it's not something you can "fix/implement": you gotta invent it first, and then convince others that it's good enough. So it's a major research project, essentially.
Would you trust a decentralized 2-way peg based on PoS and zk-SNARKs? It's also a major political/religious issue.

This is by design, Ethereum people designed sort of like a network of contracts. So, for example, DAO code can send a payout to another contract, which will split that payout between Alice and Bob. The DAO code doesn't need to know anything about details of contract between Alice and Bob.
So this actually works nicely, except that in the example above an Alice-Bob contract will start executing _before_ The DAO's code have finished executing, so it can catch The DAO code when state isn't fully updated.
Obviously you can write a contract which can call only contract it trusts, but that won't be very useful because typically a contract will involve at least two parties which are likely to be antagonistic. E.g. an Alice-Bob contract will have to call Alice's contract, which might be specifically designed to steal from Bob.

OK. Suppose you set up database replication: replicas are configured to receive data from master database. If master database crashes, one of replicas can take over.
Now suppose that the master database is compromised, i.e. an attacker got control of the computer it runs on, and is able to modify software in an arbitrary way. Replicas normally unconditionally trust the master. So if master starts sending garbage data, they will happily accept that.
How do you solve it? Replicas need to be able to detect that the master is faulty and elect a new master among themselves.
Replicas might verify data sent by the master against the schema and reject incompatible transactions, but now you have other problems:
1. How do clients know which version is right? If clients don't know that the master is compromised they will keep sending queries to master, so it doesn't matter if replicas can detect that.
2. Typically authentication is connection-based, and thus replicas cannot tell whether authentication is done right.

Let's take this, for example:


It was already extensively discussed. All serious developers agree that SegWit is fine. The difference between soft-fork and hard-fork implementations is going to be quite minimal.
The only people who were pushing the opinion that SegWit is a dirty hack are Bitcoin Unlimited developers. Who aren't the brightest bunch, so-to-speak: (1) they aren't writing much code, unlike Core developers; (2) they don't do Bitcoin maintenance; (3) their specs are sub-par; (4) their practices are sub-par (i.e. they do not communicate clearly and honestly); (5) they wrote some amateurish, broken stuff like flexible transactions, address sharding, etc.

I think they try to make sure that you get full 256 bits of entropy for every key. If you apply a 256-bit hash function to a result of a 256-bit hash function you lose some amount of entropy. That's practically insignificant, but not nice. Why weaken security if you can avoid that?

I see what you mean, it's certainly great that miners can't outright take money from users' accounts.
But saying that they can only reorder transactions downplays the threat, especially if you're talking about practical rather than theoretical matter.
Miners can rewrite history: they can insert transactions, and they can erase transactions. Rewriting history becomes more costly the deeper you do it.
Miners definitely can do financial harm, bounded only by capital available to attackers. You say like it's obscure corner case.
But pretty much every software/crypto attack is like that: you take some unlikely corner case, and find a way to reach it, and execute it with a large degree of certainty. So you shouldn't even mention it as a special case.
You know, like, probability guessing a 64-bit key is less then `0.00000000000000001%`. To a layman it might seem like it's impossible to find that key by chance. But, of course, 64-bit key is trivial brute force, so you can assume that attacker will certainly find it.

Scientific analysis of cryptocurrency security usually relies on game-theoretic models. I.e. we assume that miners are rational, they aim to maximize their payoff.
Many different kinds of games are possible, but the simplest one gives miners two options:
1. honestly following the protocol 
2. performing an attack, such as 51% attack, double-spend attack, etc.
So for a cryptocurrency,  should be a better strategy, i.e. being honest should be more profitable than participating in an attack.
The problem is, when we assume that an attacker can rent &gt;50% of hashpower at the market equilibrium rate,  is actually the winning strategy, because in that case attacker cannot lose.
So if you want cryptocurrency to be secure, hashpower shouldn't be available for rent to the highest bidder. (Sidenote: there is actually a market for hashpower: nicehash.com.) Common assumption is that miners do care about long-term success of a cryptocurrency because they happen to own a lot of equipment.
So if greedy miners rent their hashpower to an attacker, they can end up with useless worthless equipment because Bitcoin price might drop significantly. So miners actually care what they mine and won't rent their equipment to an attacker.
But if you have multiple cryptocurrencies sharing same PoW, this argument no longer works. Now it might be actually profitable to gang up and destroy a smaller coin.
This actually happened with small alt-coins, e.g. Coiledcoin, BBQcoin. I think it was Luke-jr who directed some fraction of his hashpower to destroy them. Also happened to Ethereum clone called Krypton and Litecoin clone called Feathercoin.
So a smaller coin is always in danger. It is possible to attack it anonymously: just redirect a fraction of your total hashpower to a 51% attack on a smaller coin.
But if two coins are of a similar size, it's still dangerous. Existence of an "evil twin" erodes security of the whole system: even the bigger coin might be in danger!
Now it's harder to analyze, since there are many different strategies, and a lot of factors at play.
But it's enough to say that catastrophic situations do exist. E.g. suppose there are two coins: Foo and Bar sharing same PoW function. They might have 50% of hashpower each. But, perhaps, at some point miners' profit margin drop to mere 2%, and they decide to do something. So they borrow a lot of Foo, start a FUD attack and do 51% attack or a history rewrite attack on it. Foo price drops, so they win a lot by shorting it, then switch to mining Bar.
Depending on profit margins and availability of capital, this can be tremendously profitable.
It's much harder to do this kind of an attack when there is only a single coin you can mine -- there is no backup plan.
Another problem is with hashpower oscillation. Suppose coin Foo is 10% more profitable than Bar due to a price spike. Rational miners might flock to mining Foo. Bar hashrate drops, blocks become slow and Foo becomes even more profitable. Then Foo difficulty adjusts, and it's less profitable than Bar. Now miners flock to Bar.
So basically this hard fork (Bitcoin Cash) opened the pandora's box. We can no longer have a nice game-theoretic model which explains Bitcoin security (rational miners follow the rules of the system to maximize their payoff). We have to admit that security relies on benevolence of miners, we are at their mercy.

No, you only need to know that the majority of _Bitcoin_ hashpower won't collude to kill a sidechain stealing all of its money.
 How can you know this? I mean, we don't know how the mining landscape will look like a year from now.

Why do we care what _hashpower_ wants? Hashpower is there to satisfy demands in mining, ideally it shouldn't have any "wants".
Please do not legitimize their "wants". We have seen how it works with alt-coins -- hashpower follows the price, not the other way around. If coin pays more, there will be more hashing.
Claiming otherwise is just bullshit.
But if you people start worshipping hashpower then it might become self-fulfilling prophecy, i.e. you will adjust your price expectations according to ideas of some dudes in China. Please don't do that.

Absolutely. After Bitcoin Cash launch, the Bitcoin mining situation became much more adversarial.
Previously we understood that attacks on Bitcoin would be unprofitable: if you do something to destabilize Bitcoin, you end up with a pile of useless hardware.
However, now miners can do these attacks much more freely.
E.g. if they screw up Bitcoin, they can retreat to mining Bitcoin Cash, as it can be mined using the same hardware. Moreover, you can profit from this attack:
1. Buy a lot of bcash or bcash futures. Short Bitcoin.
2. Perform a destabilizing attack on Bitcoin, spread FUD, praise bcash.
3. Profit from people dumping Bitcoin and buying bcash.
In this conditions a rushed hard fork is a suicide, it should be called off.

Pretty much all developed countries have universal healthcare or some analog. Are they socialist countries? They have robust market-based economies. 


For a number of reasons:
1. Healthcare research is a [public good](
2. Healthcare is associated with a number of [market failures]( and thus using free market approach is not efficient
3. Nationwide health is a public good, having people around you healthy is good for you
4. Sickness is random, so you want to put money into pool instead of paying directly. So why not make just one big pool?
In more detail:
`1.` I think it's pretty obvious. It might take a lot of effort, billions of dollars, to find a cure for a disease. Once it's done, it can be replicated. Currently government grants a company a temporary monopoly to produce a certain drug. Without that government monopoly you'd have very little investment into research, so you can only supplant that with public financing of research.
`2.` Your doctor is not your friend. If he is rational (as an economic actor), he is looking to optimize his profit, not your health. So he is not interested in curing you. He is interested to keep you alive to get as much money as possible from you. This is known as a [principal-agent problem](
But why is this possible? [Information asymmetry]( Doctor knows his shit, he spent years learning and practicing. You don't. So you don't know if his treatment is good or not. Healthcare is probably the most obscure good in terms of information asymmetry as it's extremely complex and inherently probabilistic.
Another problem is that care is often needed urgently. When you have a problem, you don't have time to shop around.
`3.` People around you affect your health. If they are sick, you might get sick too. So you want everyone to be healthy. You want people to have herd immunity. Also sick people are less productive, they are less happy, etc. So you benefit from other people being healthy. So if everybody benefits from it, everybody should chip in and pay for it.
`4.` You want insurance anyway, so you put money into a large pool, so why not just make one large pool for everyone and also finance research? Does this make too much sense?
As I mentioned, pretty much all countries got that, and they got great healthcare. You can dig up stats, there is a tremendous improvement in life expectancy.
You need to be a very ignorant and mean person to deny these basic facts.
Now back to your question:


Other things are not like healthcare. People have different preferences. And goods they consume have nothing to do with public goods.
So it just makes sense to let the market to handle this, to try different options, etc.


Yeah, it's been tried, and it works fine, for a long time. [Here]( in green you have countries with universal health care. Very few of them are communist countries. (ironically, China, a communist country, doesn't have universal health care.)
So universal healthcare has very little to do with communism. You've been brainwashed. Capitalist countries like UK, France, Germany do that with great success. Communist China doesn't do that.


What's so sacred about private property? It seems like it's something you worship.


Well again -- a plenty of countries have universal healthcare. It's essentially same as a compulsory insurance, math works out, it all works.

~~That's a hard fork.~~ EDIT: By definition it's a soft fork. But it will produce two chains just like a hard fork. Thus from economic/game theoretic perspective it is similar to a hard fork.
It's impossible to predict what would happen, but the mainstream theory says that the hard fork will be decided by the [economic majority](
In other words, it will depend on what merchants and exchanges do. If all major exchanges switch to the segwit fork, coins from non-segwit blocks will become worthless, so miners will have to switch to that fork too.
If exchanges remain on the original fork, the majority of nodes won't matter much. They will make Bitcoin network a bit more chaotic, but that's about it. The majority doesn't matter, you need an _economic_ majority.
Now the problem is that exchanges might support both sides of the forks. That happened with ETH/ETC fork: Poloniex started trading both sides as independent coins, and other exchanges had to follow, as otherwise users were pissed.
If that happens, people will start trading between BTC-SW and BTC-NSW. If a large number of Bitcoin holders will convert BTC-NSW to BTC-SW, then BTC-NSW price will drop, and NSW miners will have to switch to SW, as otherwise their profits will be destroyed.
So in this case the outcome will probably be decided by large coin holders.

Is it really unintended?
Difficulty oscillations are well-known, well-understood thing. We have observed this happening with alt-coins.
Now recall that BCH was created by miners. Wealthy, well-capitalized miners, who have their own development and analytic departments.
They were definitely aware of oscillations, it was part of the plan.
Now recall that BCH difficulty adjustments are asymmetric (compared to normal Bitcoin): downward adjustment is sped up, but upward adjustment is same as Bitcoin.
This allows miners to make the most profit from the oscillations: they can mine BCH, then wait, then mine it again, etc. Normally downward adjustment takes many weeks or even months, but they fixed this "issue".
Note that alt-coins which are designed for situations when multiple coins share same PoW usually have fast difficulty adjustment both ways. So BCH designers didn't follow the best practices.
So BCH is clearly an attempt of miners to rip extra profit at expense of users. It should be regarded as an attack on Bitcoin.
It's said that some people think that being impartial is a good position.
If you're aware of the attack and are impartial, then you're complicit with the attack.
If you are not aware of it, well, it's time to learn how Bitcoin works, game theory, etc.

The point of reserves is to smooth out exchange rate fluctuations. It makes sense to put the currency which is used for foreign trade into reserves, not the best performing assets.
If central banks were trying to make a profit they would have invested into stocks or something like that.
It is possible that in future Bitcoin will be used for trade, but a central bank might wait until it makes at least 1% of trading volume before putting it into reserves, that's perfectly reasonable.
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:03:28
No, it's because the state (UTXO set) gets bigger, and queries to UTXO set become more expensive (especially when it no longer fits in RAM).
For every transaction input, the node needs to find the corresponding output to verify the script. So for each input a node needs to do a DB query. When that output is in cache it might find the answer quickly. But if it's on disk it has to do a disk read which takes more time.

Miners serve the users, not the other way. Normally miners will mine the most profitable chain.
Even if 90% of hashpower will start mining 2x chain, it's unlikely they will continue doing so.
Note that it's possible to do mining anonymously, and it's not possible to force miners to mine a particular chain.
So if exchanges do not support 2x chain, miners will quickly switch to the normal one.

A programmer believes he knows the tech. He looks into Bitcoin and finds some thing which bothers him. He could spend few hours/days/weeks to research, but he's lazy, so he comes believe that Bitcoin doesn't work.

Thus transactions A and B are gone. They aren't reordered, they are gone. They are replaced, by transactions A' and B' which pay to different recipients.

Each fork weakens Bitcoin:
1. Network effect. It is good for everyone when there is a single kind of a token which is universally accepted. If there are many token types then you'll have to convert between them, or find that your tokens are not accepted in a certain situation.
2. Security. Bitcoin is secure when it's the only SHA256^2 coin. If there are many tokens sharing same PoW, they can be attacked.
3. Scarcity. If we allow forks, then we have a lot of forks. So we might have Bitcoin_killerstorm and Bitcoin_inthevibe. A lot of funbux.
Also note that hard fork already happened on August 1st, and now we have two bitcoins: Bitcoin and "Bitcoin Cash". A third one would be completely pointless and retarded.
Also note that Bitcoin will be better for payments than -Cash, because Bitcoin can support instantaneous payments via Lightning Network.

1. You do not understand how cryptocurrencies work.
2. "Consensus" doesn't mean that the majority defines the rules. It means that everybody needs to be on the same page. Bitcoin works only as long as everybody uses the same version of the protocol.
3. Beyond "the right version of Bitcoin Core is hosted on bitcoin.org", a good example of consensus at work was introduction of P2SH. From the point of view of the old clients P2SH outputs looked like anybody can spend them. So old clients couldn't understand "ownership" of those outputs correctly, but miners enforced new rules. If miners went back to the original protocol then P2SH outputs created before that could be stolen.
4. Another example is how Ethereum genesis block was created. The Foundation didn't distribute it with clients, instead they released a tool which was able to construct a genesis block from Bitcoin blockchain data (which has the information about crowdsale). People who agreed on the method and blockchain contents generated the same genesis block and thus followed Ethereum main chain. People who disagreed were on a different fork.
5. This is how it works regardless of whether you're a libertarian, a communist or an ass-clown.

Commercial bank money is always backed by bank's assets, which are usually loans which bank give to corporations and people. Those loans might be backed by mortgages and other property.


That's how it works from money supply accounting perspective, but in practice it requires somebody else to deposit money into a bank. Without deposits bank will quickly run out of reserves and won't be able to give out loans.


Reserves consist of central bank money, which has a different nature.

No. An address is a hash of a public key, so you gotta find a corresponding public key first. This is known as a preimage attack, and the only known solution is brute force, so you need ~2^160 operations to do that. The fact that hash isn't random doesn't help even a bit. (The whole point of a cryptographic hash functions is to make sure that patterns in input aren't in any way linked to patterns in output.)
And then you need to find a corresponding private key, which is also computationally infeasible.

Do you have something concrete in mind?
I tried to organize donations for Bitcoin software development in 2013, and it didn't work well.
There are basically two problems: I. people are very reluctant to donate; II. it's very hard to find the right developers.
1. Even though colored coins was a relatively popular project and a lot of people were sympathetic, we got less than $1000 in donations from community, IIRC. That doesn't buy you a lot of software development, so to speak.
2. When I tried to invite people to donate to other cool project, [the post got 300+ upvotes]( but no actual donations!
3. I don't have stats from other projects, but as far as I know, none of them got money to sustain development, even when they had a user base and "Donate!" button on a prominent place.
In case of the colored coin project, we were lucky to get some money from a corporate sponsor, but finding developers was a problem. Some of my observations:
1. Small bounties (say, $100 for a smallish task) do not help. It takes a lot of time to find people, and then code they turn in is often sub-standard and often requires further significant effort from a maintainer. If you need to find devs you have to pay commercial rate, which isn't really possible due to I.
2. People who actually want to do open source development would rather do something on their own (usually a toy project) than join an existing project.
3. Serious people who want to be involved in serious projects are few, and are already a part of Core team.
4. Smart people who can take an initiative and do things on their own would rather start a startup or do some crowdsale/ICO project than just work on some open source stuff.
So, frankly, I don't see how donations can make any difference.
Perhaps it could work better if there was a platform allowing to connect donations to particular features in a nice, visual way. But even then, I doubt that Bitcoin ecosystem is big enough to fund serious development.

No, money laundering is not about privacy.
Suppose you receive your money from something illegal, like drug trade. Obviously, you aren't going to use your bank account, you are going to use cash.
So from outside it looks like that: you have shitloads of cash, but no official source of income. Obviously, it looks very suspicious. And authorities know that, of course, so they instruct banks to report people who bring a lot of cash but have no explanation where it comes from.
So if you don't want to look suspicious, you need an explanation where money comes from. For example, you might claim it is a business profit. So e.g. you can open a fake shop which sells some gizmos, and then claim you've managed to sell a lot of it and got, say, million dollar profit.
But this method is rather problematic, since such a fake business can raise suspicion. So authorities might check whether you've actually got those business, etc.
Thus gambling is another way to launder money. E.g. suppose you know somebody who have got a winning lottery ticket  which is not yet cashed out. You might pay for that ticket in cash and then claim it was you who bought it.
So now you have a plausible explanation where you've got the money.
So anyway, Monero/Zcash are not going to solve the problem, they will make things worse -- you won't be able to demonstrate where you've got money from, and it's obvious you're trying to hide something, so chances you've got it from criminal activity are through the roof. Crypto exchanges ask you what's the source of funds when you move large sums, and there's absolutely no way you can explain that.
But if you do the challenge thing, it makes sense to mix money first so they do not obviously come from something illegal.

PoW is much simpler and makes history provably expensive to rewrite.
PoS has a problem that data which controls security of the system exists within the system itself. So there is a simulation argument -- one might simulate PoS system from the start and you will not know which is real and which is fake. (With PoW the one with more work is _probably_ the real one -- i.e. simulation is very expensive.)
Thus PoS needs to rely on "weak subjectivity" -- you need some point of reference when you join a system. I.e. you need not just code, but also data on some recent blocks, e.g. few month or years ago. It's not really a huge issue, this data might be embedded into the client release, or downloaded from trusted sites like blockchain.info, exchanges and so on.
But people who are big PoW proponents make it sound like it's a big deal.
Also it's very hard to make PoS right. PoS often need to rely on randomness, and that randomness needs to come from within the system, which is very tricky.
There is also a way to combine PoW with PoS -- in that case you take randomness from PoW and thus escape the "system is defined from within" problem. It's known as proof-of-activity [PDF]( some variation of it is implemented in Decred alt-coin.

That was the case ~5 years ago.
Newer designs fixed the issue. There are several peer-reviewed academic articles proposing PoS schemes. Particularly, there is one from Silvio Micali, who is one of top cryptographers, co-inventor of zero-knowledge proofs.
And on the other hand, we have Poelstra's article, which is NOT peer reviewed, and has multiple logical flaws.
It's _very_ biased. Poelstra doesn't bother to mention any of PoWs flaws. For example, as you might know, a Bitcoin node might be fooled by minority hashpower when it's isolated from the rest of the network. This is a very real, practical flaw -- but it is rarely mentioned.
On the other hand, Poelstra mentioned a highly impractical attack where attacker has to buy everyone's keys to simulate prior history.

If the rate is like 1% per year that's barely noticeable. Plus, I think we should primarily care about security rather than economics.
Economics is hard. There are so many what-ifs.
If yearly profit is 1% of the stake, then $1M stake gives you $10000, which is barely enough to live off on poorer parts of the world. You need $10M stake to make a living in US. So "increased concentration of wealth" isn't something I'd care about.

They can censor transaction, slow down the network, do 51% attack, double-spending, etc.
They also control protocol updates.
Yes, they don't control the history. It's a single thing which they don't control.


Shitty protocol, admit it. I don't want China to be able to censor my transactions.


Bitcoin is also "working" for a very loose definition of "working". If China government wants to censor transactions tomorrow, it will be able to. So much for a censorship-resistant currency independent of governments.
Bitcoin is working in the sense that transactions get confirmed, so does BitShares in this sense. If you consider a security of it, both are very much less than perfect.

Nakamoto was naive in many ways, he also didn't envision
 * pooled mininig
 * mining centralization
 * rational miners/replace by fee (which make zero-confirmation and transaction replacement logic impossible)
It looks like Satoshi was viewing Bitcoin mostly as a peer-to-peer system (analogous to BitTorrent), but in reality economic aspects became more important than p2p software aspects. Basically, when a lot of money is at stake, people try to maximize money they get instead of just following the rules you told them to follow.
So yes, it's nothing like Nakamoto envisioned, but that started in 2010 when people started using pooled mining instead of mining using their own full nodes.
It's very well possible that Satoshi anticipated the problems we have now, but never talked about them. Would people start using Bitcoin if he said that in 5 years it would face centralization risks? Unlikely.

If you wonder which of the existing coins have a chance to survive in the long run:
1. Nxt: It was noted that their PoS sucks, but they might be able to update it since it has quite self-contained code base.
2. NEM: They have some interesting consensus features. Not necessarily secure, but interesting, at least.
3. BitShares: They use a model which is quite simple, but robust. Instead of trusting random people to run the network, they elect 21(?) witnesses. Called Delegated Proof of Stake. While this isn't very sophisticated, it might work well in practice, since in the worst case they can simply reboot the system.

The amount of energy used to create bitcoinsin 2009-2011 is completely trivial compared to amounts burned in more recent years.
Thus it really doesn't matter... Some random dude installed Bitcoin miner on his computer and CPU-mined 50 BTC reward. How does it affect you now?
What if that dude formatted his hard drive, thus locking that 50 BTC forever?
A lot of coins mined in 2009-2010 haven't been ever moved.


Just like people who mined bitcoins in 2009-2010 "can lock up their tokens creating a bubble". I don't see a difference between PoW and "premine" here.
Perhaps it was like that immediately after launch, i.e. few ether tokens were in circulation.
However, now 20M out of 90M ether which exists now were mined. I'm quite sure that's enough to crash the price and thus prevent the bubble. (I mean suppose 72M tokens were locked, but then 20M tokens were dumped on the market, shouldn't that crash the price?)
But many of "pre-mined" tokens were sold on the market quite early on, and they are not different from PoW-mined coins.
It's not like Ripple where a single corporation controls the supply. Ethereum tokens were bought by many people, also they were awarded to many people, also they were awarded to Ethereum Foundation which sold a lot of them already. So "locking up tokens creating a bubble" seems like a massive conspiracy.

You forget that money is not a fundamental thing, it's an abstraction. Money exists in your head.
In reality it's the society providing service. Money is just how we account for that so it's all balanced, but it's not how it fundamentally works.
Continuously thinking about money will make you dull and bitter. E.g. suppose you have a kid and you give him food. For a normal person, it's just that -- you are feeding your kid.
For a market obsessed person, well, perhaps, kid isn't getting food for free, you paid for the food, right? It's not free food. So maybe your kid owes you something.
Or when you pick an apple from a tree. Apple tree doesn't charge you. But, of course, you could now sell this apple on the market, it stills has some value, right? So if you eat this free apple you, like, spend $0.01 you didn't have.
Metering everything is just absurd.  Do you want to meter sunlight, water in rivers, etc?

This is not a hash. Not every hex string is a hash, dude. :D
It is basically a part of a transaction where the message is written. It is, as code says, scriptSig of the coinbase transaction, which can have arbitrary data.
You can think of it as a pseudocode of a line of code which Satoshi used to put the message in. It's not a separate message, it is a comment which describes the message Satoshi put in. It is reversed because it is in a  different byte order. (I.e. a normal way of writing numbers on paper is big-endian, but physically little-endian representation is often used, so order of characters is flipped.)
So back to a question of what is "hash", hash is an output of a hash function. If one uses a cryptographically secure hash function, then this output is "unpredictable" in the sense that it is infeasible to find and input which produces certain output. So hiding a message in a hash would be impossible without breaking cryptography.
Hexadecimal strings can be used to represent _any_ binary data (strictly speaking, octet strings), including hashes. Say, private and public keys can be represented in hex, but they are not hashes.

One of common way to implement PoS is to select a pseudorandom set of coin owners to sign the next block.
This selection can depend only only the current state of the blockchain. So, basically, current state defines who signs the next block, and thus the next state.
In simple words, blockchain defines who are current coin owners, and current coin owners define the blockchain in future.
Here's a simple example. Suppose initially all coins are owned by a single user, say, Alice. (This was actually how Nxt was created.) So in block 1, Alice owns all coins. In block 2, she might transfer some of her coins to Bob. In block 3, Bob transfers some of his coins to Claire. And so on. Perhaps at block 100,000 Alice no longer has her coins.
Now suppose attacker have obtained Alice's old key. Now he can simulate the whole blockchain: he can make his own version of block 2, where he will transfer money to Bob2 -- a new fake account he created. He can do this process for the whole blockchain, and he will own all the coins on the fake blockchain.
Now the problem is, it's impossible to say which of blockchains are fake, they are identical aside from keys/signatures. To tell which one is real, you need to follow it from the beginning.

SegWit will lock in in a couple of weeks, it effectively gives you 2 MB blocks.

Fighting against Chinese control over Bitcoin is considered infighting now?
China already manufactures the majority of equipment, they host biggest mining operations, and now they are paying the Western dev teams to do the development according to their liking. They aren't even trying to hid this.
If you want ChinaCoin just buy ChinaCoin and leave Bitcoin alone.
It IS important to inform people about what is going on. Bitcoin isn't fully trustless, the hashrate comes from somewhere, development comes from somewhere. And people need to understand who controls it, where influence and money comes from.

Yes they are right that it's not a big issue in practice, as one needs a lot of stake to pull of the attack.
However, this makes the protocol relatively weaker. When stakes become high, it might be a problem. E.g. some people might use a manipulative tactics to spread a modified version of software which is supposed to boost stake reward -- but also forks the network.
There is also a possibility that somebody will offset his loss in case of an attack with margin trading (short-selling) and buying competing coin. So the reality is that 25% of stake is enough to pull of an attack, and the cost of it might be not very high.

NYA is an agreement which was signed by participants. But it has no legal consequences, and thus is not binding.
As for signalling, we should certainly differentiate between signalling which has defined meaning in the protocol, and thus has potential consequences, from signalling which is just advisory.
There are no guarantees, though.
Say, if you play poker with real money at stake, you aren't guaranteed to lose money. But that doesn't mean that it's just an advisory, does it?
Versionbits signalling can be enforced by user nodes, so not implementing it properly is risky. There's no guarantee miner will lose money, but it's quite possible.
Putting "NYA" into coinbase is, at best, advisory. More like garbage, since it has no technical meaning whatsoever.
(Miners are registered organizations, so you can sue them. An agreement could also require them to put money into an escrow. So agreements involving miners can be enforceable, but it's very unlikely miners will ever enter an enforceable agreement.)

Well, you know that there are only about a dozen of major mining pools/mining operations, right? So if they collude, they collectively own more than 50% of all hashpower, and thus can easily do 50% attack, or some other nasty shit like censorship.
Or, for example, China can nationalize all mining facilities within China to do whatever they want. Usually people say some bullshit like it will be more profitable for China to keep it. Well, China doesn't really care about $50B, it's a small amount of money for them. It's more about politics. So, basically, Bitcoin security relies on politics, how nice is that?
Imagine if we developed a encryption algorithm we know NSA can crack, and then claim that it's OK because it's not in their interest to attack you personally. Doesn't that mean that the algorithm is deeply flawed?
There are more theoretic problems listed in [Proof-of-activity]( article section 2. (Which also proposes a solution, BTW.)

The possibility of oscillations was known for years (since 2012 or so), they routinely happen with alt-coins which share PoW. Alt-coins have well-known and well-understood counter measures, such as fast difficulty adjustment time.
Even shittiest alt-coins which are Bitcoin copycats have this mitigating mechanism.


It is definitely malevolent. Bcash was endorsed by major miners like ViaBTC and Bitmain. They are definitely more sophisticated than random alt-coin dev team, they are miners, so they understand difficulty, etc.
Imagine hundred million dollar business doing a mistake which is obvious to a university freshman. Is it accidental? No.


You're missing one thing: it is good to miners, since Bcash peculiar difficulty adjustment mechanism boosts their profit.
So an alt-coin which was endorsed by miners have a weird quirk which boosts miners' profit? Yeah totally just an accident, it's not like miners have their own analytics team, and it's not like this problem is easily preventable. (Just copy difficulty adjustment algo from an alt-coin.)
Note that the fact that there is a backlog on Bitcoin side is **also** very profitable to miners: they get as much as 5 BTC in fees per block, that's a nice 40% boost to block reward. It essentially doubles their profits, not bad, huh? This little quirk earns miners something like a billion dollars per year.
It's also possible that miners wanted to push Bitcoin into hard-fork. Now this problem exists. It can be solved by adjustment to a difficulty computation algorithm. How convenient that we have a hard fork scheduled in November, perhaps we could fix this issue by bundling oscillation-resistant difficulty adjustment?
Again, the problem was **widely** known, Bcash code was reviewed by many teams. There is no possibility that it's accidental.

Waiting 25 years for a confirmation is impractical. Thus using Bitcoin to settle payments &gt;1 BTC will be impractical.
You're saying that 1 BTC might be so large that no one will ever need to send 1 BTC, how about you demonstrate that it's possible? E.g. consider a scenario where Bitcoin replaces gold and fiat currencies (best case) and convert 1 BTC to current dollars.
Note that currently the banking system can easily settle billion dollar payments within days, or, sometimes, even minutes. Nobody has to wait years for a confirmation.
Note that the fees users pay now are enough to confirm 1 BTC payments, so it is clear that fee market can provide better security when block subsidy is negligible.


I don't mind the discussion, but please do some math too. It is easy to shut down a discussion with non-arguments like "but maybe it's OK" and "who knows". If you have something to say, please show in which specific conditions it makes sense.
I.e. if you claim that there are conditions in which it is possible, you should be able to specify concrete parameters. 


No, you didn't even bother to understand my arguments. Here's what you wrote:


I used absolutely minimal assumptions. Just one assumption, actually: that people would want to get their 1 BTC payments confirmed. If you can somehow make fewer assumptions, I'm all in ears.

It depends on actual numbers and assumptions. We don't know how much capital is available to an attacker.
As a back-of-the-envelope calculation, suppose that attacker invests $100M into bcash, then successfully attacks Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is no longer usable and people flock to bcash, and bcash price matches the current price of Bitcoin, attacker gets 10x his money, which is $1B. That's probably more than normal mining profits.
Of course, this will work only if bcash price reaches the current Bitcoin price, which is unlikely. But you need to take into account that there might be a massive disinformation campaign, so we cannot rule it out.

OK, more detailed algorithm:
For every TxIn you need to determine whether referenced transaction is 
1. present in UTXO db (on disk or in cache)
2. present in blocks being scanned
3. not present anywhere.
To check this, you first look in hash table of recently scanned transactions produced by every thread. You gotta make sure that this check happens only after all threads have finished the first surface scan, so that (1) all scanned transactions are there; (2) hash tables are not written to, so you can read them in parallel.
Thus multiple threads can do these lookups in parallel.
First, let's consider the case when the transaction referenced by TxIn is found in HT of just-scanned transactions.
1. Through the HT you obtain a pointer to CScannedTransaction object, which is your usual deserialized transaction + information about which outputs are already spent (just an array).
2. You verify whether your TxIn can spend corresponding output.
3. You atomically mark output as spent. This can be done in thread-safe manner using compare-and-swap primitive.
At this point TxIn is validated and output is marked as spent, so it shouldn't be written to UTXO DB. If there are two transactions trying to spend the same output you will find out when you mark it as spent atomically: this will fail, and you can mark block as invalid.
If referenced transaction isn't found in HTs, then we follow the usual algorithm: try to find it in UTXO DB, update it as necessary or fail. You only need to make sure that UTXO DB can handle concurrent writes.
New UTXOs are written to main UTXO DB only after all transactions were connected.
A more high-level description of the algorithm:
1. We first build a temporary in-memory TxOut database for transactions being scanned. All transactions are there, not just unspent, so order doesn't matter. It can be built in parallel, either using a shard pet thread, or using some lock-free data structures.
2. We connect inputs using both normal UTXO DB and this temporary TxOut DB.
3. We scan TxOut DB and write unspent outputs to the main database, then destroy TxOut DB.
All steps can be done in parallel but there needs to be synchronization between steps. Also DB writes need to be synchronized in some way.

Bitcoin allows one to send coins to any address by design.
In LN sending coins off-chain is possible only under certain conditions. Nobody knows how often these conditions will be met. Perhaps almost all transactions will be off-chain. But still there are some cases where you have no option but to send on-chain, and if your money is locked in channels, it might be somewhat annoying.
I don't think it will be always 100% seamless even in the most optimistic scenario.
In 20 years we'll probably see Bitcoin protocol extensions which further assist Lighting. LN was designed to be compatible with existing Bitcoin Script, but if it will be commonplace, it makes sense to design core protocol around Lighting.
E.g. you might see extensions which allow more efficient multiparty channels, or some sort of multi-hop primitives.
It is very well possible that LN will be considered a norm.
But I don't think it will happen any time soon. We don't only need LN integrated into wallets, we need users being accustomed to it. The UX will be somewhat different.
Which is fine, but I think it's disingenuous to claim that we just need wallets with LN support.
BTW I really doubt wallets will have LN as soon as it's standardized. It will be a show and gradual process, particularly it will take time to design UX.
Most likely there will be a separate LN wallet which people will use for micro-transactions, tipping, etc.

OK, why do you think block size/weight limit exists? What it's purpose?
Try to think about it for a few minutes.
Answer: Block size limit exists to prevent abuse from **miners'** side. 
E.g. imagine there is no block size limit. That means that a miner can produce arbitrary large blocks: 10 MB, 100 MB, etc. He easily fill a block with junk data e.g. by sending coins to himself repeatedly. If this happens, the network could quickly become unusable, as it won't be feasible for users to run full nodes. So this could have been used to kill Bitcoin.
Thus when you talk about block size, you need to consider the worst possible situation, not a typical one, and not the happy case.
Moreover, the actual constant which is used in code and specification is 8000000. Please tell me how referencing the actual technical constant is manipulative?!?! We are discussing technical matters, ffs, we need to be precise.
I have a question for you. You, obviously, do not have a good knowledge of Bitcoin protocol and security reasoning behind it. So why do you have an urge to argue about this matter?

Informing other people =/= whining.


You don't understand how it works.
Bitcoin isn't going to install itself onto people's computers and buy itself. People choose a version they want to run, install it, and buy coins.  So in the end, it all depends on human actions.
Bitcoin isn't a way to achieve consensus, it is a way to _automate_ consensus.
E.g. suppose Alice and Bob need to maintain a ledger. They can agree to every record. However, that's tiresome. So they automate it -- they run a software which will validate entries according to pre-agreed rules and automatically form consensus.
Now if Alice fundamentally disagrees with Bob and changes rules in her software, it won't be in consensus with Bob's software.


Almost 70 billion dollars now...
It's much less clear what's the outside when you realize that blockchain isn't some magic place where coins live, but a ledger maintained by people with help of software.
Software isn't some magic source of truth, it's simply a tool which people use.


Well, that sucks, of course, but blockchain exists in the real world where things like "legal action" can happen.
If there is a risk of monetary loss, you might try praying to Blockchain God to fix it for you, but that's unlikely to work. Or you can take an action to protect the value. It's up to you.


Why? But you and him exist in the real world, so you might take action against somebody capitalizing on it.
You're probably confused. We want to automate consensus as much as possible, thus consensus cannot rely on human action, of course. If we need people to constantly guard consensus, it's just not viable.
But we are talking about one-time event here. If there is one-time, unique threat, that's it's not really a problem with a lack of automation. You might implement some corrective measures in software OR you can take some actions in the real world, it doesn't really matter because it's going to happen only once.

It's a _tragedy of commons_ kind of a situation, actually: each individual miner wants to mine a block as big as possible, to maximize fees he collects. But miners as a whole want to keep blocks relatively small to maximize their profits.

Bitcoin is based on economic incentives. It's extremely unlikely that all miners will stop mining at the same time. If there's demand, there's mining. One defector is enough to get it going. Also mining can be 100% impossible to enforce the blockade.

No, it's not exactly the same: TTP usually implies a single point of failure, while a private blockchain can be resilient to multiple failures.


Trusting a single entity is _very_ different that trusting a majority.
Suppose you have 10 companies which wish to maintain a common database. 
a) They might elect a single company to maintain the database, but then they will _depend_ on this company, so it will be in a preferential position.
b) Instead they can use a piece of software which synchronizes database and is able to tolerate failures. None of companies will have any preferences.

Proof-of-existence doesn't help us to _detect_ multiple conflicting versions. Proof-of-publication allows us to detect all published versions and act on that, e.g.:
1. if the system is supposed to detect fraud &amp; security breaches, if multiple conflicting documents are detected, operations should be stopped and the case should be investigated
2. if you need system to act on documents in an automatic fashion, you can define that the first correct version to be published is the real one, and the rest should be ignored


Let's consider an example. Suppose Alice wants to sell her house twice. She prepares two documents: one of them transfers the title to Bob, another transfers the title to Claire. She timestamps both of these documents in a blockchain. She gets payments both from Bob and Claire.
Note that Claire cannot know that the house was already sold to Bob: she only knows that a document which transfers document to her exist at a certain date. She doesn't know that another document also exists. Proof-of-existence is completely useless here.
Of course, fraud will be eventually detected (in the meatspace, a blockchain won't help you here if you use only proof-of-existence), but Alice has plausible deniability: she can claim that her private key was stolen by a hacker, who then impersonated Alice in a transaction with Claire.
This, indeed, could have happened: if somebody steals Alice's private key, he can sign documents on her behalf and put their hashes into a blockchain. Proof-of-existence doesn't help to detect security breaches.
Proof-of-existence helps against true back-dating: e.g. suppose Mallory have stolen Alice's key after Alice have already transferred ownership to Bob. Mallory can try to sign a backdated document to claim that she got the house before Bob did, but this can be detected via proof-of-existence.
Proof-of-existence doesn't help when multiple versions can exist _secretly_, which is very much a real possibility. It's not a problem for attacker to prepare document beforehands, timestamp it, and reveal it only later, when it does the maximal damage. But it's also something which a legitimate key holder can do.


If you use proof-of-publication, you don't even need a title search agency. I'm not saying that it's an easy thing to do, but it's theoretically possible, and that could save people a lot of money.
More approachable cases are ones when db in question just doesn't exist yet. For example, I've heard that there is a problem with fraud in invoice factoring: some people try to sell same invoice to multiple banks. This can trivially be solved using proof-of-non-publication: when one applies for factoring, he needs to prove that other banks haven't taken this invoice yet; which can be implemented using proof-of-publication.


These hashes must be discoverable to be useful, i.e. you need to be able to find all hashes related to a certain property. 


Yes, if all hashes published by a title agency are discoverable.


No, not really. There are, basically, two categories of cases:
1. you want to monitor a centralized entity
2. you want to replace a centralized entity with a decentralized system
Proof-of-publication can do both. In the first case it's enough to publish hashes. In the second case you typically want some more information to be published.
Some examples of case  are Counterparty, Omni, Ascribe, etc.
Removing a centralized entity altogether has a number of benefits:
1. a centralized compute system can crash (or get compromised), and you suffer from the downtime
2. a centralized entity might start charging unreasonable fees, or manipulate the system to give preference to some users at cost of others

What if Bitcoin Cash gets bigger hash rate, will they switch to Bitcoin Cash? This just makes no sense.
I think most hashpower-worshipping people understood their defeat when they saw two different chains. The bigger one cannot kill the smaller one because it has different rules. Brian Armstrong of Coinbase used to spew nonsense about miners voting on protocol changes and pluralism of implementations, now he's silent, and his company is ignoring Cash.
Perhaps there are still few people who hold this views, but, at least, now we don't hear anything from them. was all about hashrate worship, but once they got cash, they are happy with a minority chain. Hashrate rhetoric was just rhetoric, not something they actually believed in.


Usually people who can't follow the technical details just fall for marketing. If marketing says that bigger hashrate is better, they will believe that.

There is no such thing as 100% safe investment, especially in Ukraine. The best thing you can do is to spread your risks.
In theory, bank deposits are secure against bank failure, as government is supposed to reimburse by law. In practice, however:
 * it often takes 6+ months for government to recognize the failure and compensate
 * compensation is in a local currency, which might be devalued by the time compensation is made
 * government might issue a law to cancel compensation at any time
 * max compensation is $7000 (per one bank)
Bitcoins can be stolen or lost. Also might lose their value.
Real estate has different risk profile. Ultimately, government enforces property ownership, so they might fail you. Particularly, a common scenario is that a previous owner might contest a sale (e.g. property was foreclosed and previous owner will claim that foreclosure was illegal).

You can try CPFP if you feel enthusiastic. It's not simple. Basically you gotta spent your currently unconfirmed coins with a higher fee.
If your mobile wallet doesn't let you to do that (also note that you might need to adjust fee manually), you might try to export the private ket and make transaction manually using coinb.in or other service. That's sort of risky and involved.
The requirements are simple:
1. a transaction must include an unconfirmed input (which you wish to accelerate)
2. fee should cover fees for both transactions, i.e. fee you want to add to the old one + fee for the new one
Few pools have CPFP enabled so you might have to wait few hours but I've heard they exist.

No. Proof-of-existence (aka timestamping) requires only a hash, but proof-of-publication is more complex. Usually it requires important information from the document to be published.

Core proposed 17% per year. That makes much more sense than 20x in one go.
Gavin's proposal was outright ridiculous. Yeah, let's just increase a critical network parameter 10x, what could go wrong?


Right now block reward is a fixed block subsidy plus transaction fees.
If we were designing a cryptocurrency from scratch, we could make block subsidy dynamic depending various parameters: for example, increases block size decreases subsidy (miners are penalizing for making big blocks), coin-days-destroyed increase subsidy (miners are encouraged to add non-spam transactions).
Of course, this would require some tweaking to make it work properly, but as someone with math background I'm quite certain it's possible to find a formula which will work fine in a wide range of situations.
Tweaking Bitcoin block subsidy might be impossible for political reasons, but we could tie block size to coin-days-destroyed, for example. (I.e. you can make big blocks only if you add meaningful transactions.)
Coin-days-destroyed is hard to abuse, you need A LOT of capital to do that, and we can assume that people who own a lot of bitcoins wish it well, so it's a bit like proof-of-stake in that respect.


We don't need to identify "Bob" and "Alice" here, I was talking about coin age. Transactions with higher coin age are higher priority, as simple as that. If your coin age is low, this means one of two things:
1. you sent a transaction recently
2. you received money recently and want to send again
In the first case, you should wait and give others an opportunity to send theirs. In the second case, you should organize your wallets more efficiently, in such a way that you don't need to send coins multiple times.
If the sort order depends both on fee rate and coin age, it will just soft-penalize repeated senders. People who really need that (or just fucked up) will have to stomach higher fees, while others will enjoy low fees.

There is no proof that cryptographic primitives used by Bitcoin are secure. Moreover, there are no proofs that secure algorithms are even possible. (That's contingent on P=/=NP which is still an open problem now.)
Bitcon is not secured by "mathematics", it is secured by cryptography from one side, and cryptoeconomics (game theory/economic incentives) from another. You are right that economics side seem to be softer, but cryptography isn't guaranteed to be 100% unbreakable.

Store of value is definitely one of the purposes it was designed for. I'd say the main purpose.


And lack of reliable store of value is definitely a real world problem.
 * National currencies are very unreliable (aside from top 5, maybe): government can inflate the currency at will, savings value evaporates.
 * Banks cannot be trusted. It's very common for bank to go bankrupt.
 * A government might actually seize privately owned gold.
 * If you store hard currency or gold "under a mattress", you might get robbed.
Bitcoin gives people an opportunity to store value completely outside of government's control, which is, like, a killer feature.

`with-read` should lock a db row while execution goes inside of it (i.e. the dynamic extent in Lisp terms).
[Here's an example in Common Lisp]( As you see, a function which mutates the same row cannot be called, so it eliminates this specific problem.
Another way to fix this is on language level is to make variables bound by `with-read` to be dynamically updated (i.e. it always tracks value in the database). This is how `with-slots` works in Common Lisp, for example.


The point is to make it explicit instead of implicit. E.g. a function which does a db write returns an update object. You can merge updates using a `merge-updates` function, but it needs to be called explicitly. This function can detect conflicts (i.e. attempts to overwrite earlier values). You can also introduce `overwrite-updates` function, but it will be rarely used, indicating that something non-trivial is going on.


You need an imperative context, of course, but the thing is that each SQL command is self-contained, and so you don't have problems with 'caching' stale values. (In other words, SQL commands compose more easily.)

I think Litecoin might be a good choice for small-value purchases, actually. It is pretty much identical to Bitcoin and has a solid track record. Also back in 2013 merchants were starting to accept Litecoin, but I think it faded away.
SegWit might alleviate a pressure a little, but in best case we'll get back to "13 cents a transaction", which isn't good for small-value transactions. So something like Litecoin would make more sense. You don't really need full security of Bitcoin network for &lt;$10 transactions.
But we need to get through "maximalism" and admit there is a problem. "Maximalism" is basically just people protecting their investments. It is natural. But Litecoin isn't going to eat Bitcoin's lunch of you advertise it as "a network for small-value transactions" which is "less secure than Bitcoin".
People say that payment channels/Lightning Network is the only proper solution, but they change how cryptocurrency works in a fundamental way (i.e. you gotta have you money locked in channels, you cannot simply transact freely with whoever you want), so in the best case the adoption will take years.
Federated sidechains could work, but they offer a different security trade-offs. Personally I'm fine with that (for small-value transactions), but Litecoin has an advantage of already existing right now. (And disadvantage of currency conversion, although it have been more-or-less stable against Bitcoin for a year or so.)

Yes, you shouldn't just trust Bob, you should also check those keys on keyservers, github, etc. Unless Bob already owns your machine, you will be able to detect the attack. (Unless Bob have also hacked bitcoin.org, github and a dozen of other web sites.)

So a blockchain is an alternative to centralized systems.
"Publicly shared information on the internet" is either not secure, or requires a **trusted** third party. Just posting something somewhere doesn't work, because information can be easily changed.


Proof-of-publication is much more powerful than timestamping. Timestamping doesn't solve double-spending.


I worked with "crypto functions" both in the context of a blockchain and outside it, I know how it works. The problem with non-blockchain cryptography is that it often requires trusted third parties or just centralized systems.

Bitcoin Core is. Bitcoin Core binaries are built through gitian process which makes it possible for multiple people to verify that binaries match the source code.
As far as I know, there is no equivalent to gitian for iOS and Android wallets, so it is impossible for them to match the same degree of verification. Safety of mobile wallets is based only on reputation of authors.


Yes. People who save otherwise do not know what they are talking about.
Some hardware wallets have open source firmware, then you can build firmware from source yourself and flash it. And hope it's actually being used. It might be hard to tell with custom hardware, you know.

For a mainstream investor Bitcoin only makes sense as long as there is a single Bitcoin. Mining is done to maintain a _single ledger_, specifically to make it 100% unambiguous.
People just won't see it as money if it can be forked.
This is why we pretend that forking is impossible, and this is why we say that alt-coin are scams, or funny-money.
This is **the vision**: a single, global ledger, where anyone can check an address balance, or whether a payment was made, and there is **no uncertainty**. That's the point.
If there two versions, say Bitcoin_A and Bitcoin_B, there will be also Bitcoin_X3424324.
For me, as a nerd, blockchain wars seem exciting.
But no _normal person_ will accept this shit. We spend hundreds of millions of dollars to maintain a _single ledger_. And then we end up having two. This means we failed.
I don't care about _your_ opinion. You're a nerd, just like me. Go grab some investment banks and ask _them_ what they think about Bitcoin forking. What is better: a theoretic threat or a fact that ledger is ambiguous?

So they basically want to do raspil, but with crypto money instead of government money.
In the white paper, they do not explain how it works, only bullshit about it. They claim that their ASIC is "non-von Neumann architecture". Well, guess what, bit-level optimizations were used since mining on FPGAs, all Bitcoin ASICs are non-von Neumann.
Then they claim it will be 16 nm chip. As far as I know, there are no 16 nm facilities in Russia, they are still struggling with 90 nm. They are more than decade behind the rest of the world.
So what's the secret sauce? They also claim that their miner is somehow multi-cellular. But again, there are multiple unrolled SHA-256 engines in all Bitcoin ASIC miners.
So this seems like a lot of bullshit. In the best case they will just buy chips from other manufacturer.

You're essentially saying that we shouldn't call attack an attack because we cannot address it on the protocol level. This makes no sense.

Well, a society consists of people. 
When you see it as a pure game theoretic way without regard for morals, it's just more efficient to kill rich people and seize their assets.
And rich people cannot hire guards. Because, guess what if guards can cooperate, a better payoff for them is to kill the rich person and seize his assets than to receive salary. (If you receive salary you receive 5% of his wealth over time. If you kill him, you get 100%. Which is more profitable, usually.)
So a society cannot function without morals, we basically have prisoner's dilemma where nothing gets built and people fight for resources.
So we gotta have morals, like we do not kill, we do not steal, we help people who are in need.
If you think about it, morals in modern days are usually based on empathy which is roughly connected to Kant's Categorical Imperative (i.e. if you see a person in a bad situation you might imagine how it would feel like if you was him, and you want the society to help him because you or your loved ones might end up in the bad situation next time). So it is both idyllic and necessary for purely pragmatic reasons too.
Unless you enjoy seeing people suffering, it's just better for you to see happy people around.

From [Satoshi himself](


and global view problems you've asked about are solved.
More specific problem which blockchain is solving is double-spending, i.e. a possibility of ambiguity in signed documents. A user might sign multiple conflicting versions of a document, and you need some means to find which of them is "real".
For example, if one transfers ownership of a house, usually he needs to register a deed (evidence of transfer) in a certain central registry. Otherwise one can produce multiple such deeds, so multiple parties will believe they own a house.
Blockchain solves this problem in a decentralized environment, i.e. in case when you cannot or don't want to rely on a single trusted party.
It's not just a distrust in authorities, sometimes a central db doesn't exist just because nobody bothers to maintain one. It's actually a burden. If this can solved with a piece of software, that's nice.


It was developed to solve a very specific issue with a p2p currency, true, but a lot of different applications have same or related issue, and thus can benefit from a blockchain.
Satoshi was involved in discussion of BitDNS, for example. So it's not only p2p currency, it's also name registration. And also many other cases which need disambiguation.

These projects implement bidirectional payment channels.
So far I haven't seen anybody modelling actual topology and usage patterns.
E.g. suppose you have an ideal payment channel &amp; routing implementations, then how would the thing look like end users?
This analysis doesn't need to be very technical, in fact, it's quite possible to do it using just a piece of paper and very basic arithmetic.
So where is it? Do people just assume that any topology will work, or that eventually we'll figure something out, or what?
@_date: 2016-11-14 19:32:58
Here's an illustration of what is bad about "side effects" aka global variables. Suppose somebody took your "Simple payment" example and [added a function which pays a tax]( and call it automatically from [pay]( so taxes are paid automatically. Nice!
Now, obviously, it's not a nice code, as there is a duplication. But at least it works...
Later somebody "refactors" it and [moves pay-tax call lower]( Why? I dunno. Perhaps he wanted tax to be paid after a sufficient funds check.
Now this function doesn't work properly. It doesn't crash, but the tax amount isn't deducted from the payee's account (because the value written by pay-tax is the overwritten with cached amount). Money is created from thin air!
Can this kind of a problem be prevented on a language level? Yes, definitely. There is a number of ways to do this:
1. `with-read` might lock read values so they can only be changed by an update statement which is lexically within `with-read`. This is a very ad-hoc rule, but it might be effective for preventing this sort of a problem.
2. Allow only one write per call. For example, functions might return an update objects instead of actually updating stuff. (Basically, the way it works in Haskell.)
3. SQL UPDATE idiom is immune to this sort of a problem: `UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - amount WHERE name = 'Bob'`.
The root problem is the imperative programming paradigm: global mutable state makes programs fragile. So basically you have the same problem as EVM. (As you might know, many contracts turned out to be extremely sensitive to ordering of statements, this is a classic imperative programming issue.) I find it so weird that Haskell programmers made an imperative smart contract language.
Sorry, but you cannot just take Lisp and call it a safe smart contract language. Lisp is great (actually, it's my favorite language) but safe it is not.
Pact might be indeed safer than EVM/Solidity. Elimination of recursive calls seems like a great idea. But you didn't eliminate the main problem: global mutable state which can be mutated in a pretty much arbitrary way.

Yes, they were incredibly naive. Gavin's flawed simulations were immediately picked apart. Numerous people -- both Core developers and miners -- rejected the notion that we are ready for 20 MB blocks. Then [scholars]( also rejected the notion that 20 MB will be fine.
But who cares about devs, miners and scholars when you have Gavin's word?
It's hilarious that Gavin called himself "Chief scientist", but it was Peter Todd who [actually used rigorous math]( to analyze the subject matter. Apparently, Gavin is so great that he doesn't even need to write those pesky formulas.


Some planning needs to go into cryptocurrency design. Market cannot design things, it just doesn't work this way.
Obviously, there was a market for anonymous cryptocurrency for a long time, but it only came to existence as a result of Satoshi's work. And Satoshi didn't ask the market for parameters (such as a specific PoW function), but he didn't.
I don't think you understand what "central economic planning" is, plans are supposed to be very specific. Setting up rules isn't "central planning".


So the most simple incentive function is "free market" and more complex one is "central economic planning"? This makes no sense.


Larger blocks (1) let miners to confirm more transactions, and thus, potentially, profit more; (2) have bigger external costs.
So it makes sense to introduce a counter-incentive to make game more balanced, thus making it possible to converge towards an equilibrium.


Obviously you need to model it in such a way that empty blocks won't be an optimum.


Yes, it will be a failure if it is designed by a person who doesn't know math. But I think there are enough people who actually understand math to design it properly.

No. There are some similarities, but unidirectional payment channels are very simple: recipient cannot take more than payer allows, and he's disinterested in taking less. There are different variations, sometimes recipient can finalize transaction at any time, sometimes he has to wait.
LN payment channels use multi-level contracts which make it possible to punish a party which publishes a retired transaction. This is much more complex than unidirectional payment channels. (Also more fragile.)

I think we should distinguish explicit exceptional situations from crashes.
There are certainly cases where precondition for contract's execution is not met, so it should be aborted. But it's one thing when contract's author is aware of this situation, so he inserts an explicit check for that, and an explicit throw statement (or uses some similar tool, like `enforce`). And it's another thing when a case like this is encountered in run-time.
So I think ideally it should be possible to prove that a contract can fail only in certain ways. And the more explicit it is, the better.
And, ideally, it should be possible to check whether a certain call would crash by evaluating some relatively simple predicate. (I mean check with 100% certainty.)
Ability to extract this predicate is very powerful. For example, you might notice that for `withdraw` function it is `FALSE`, that is, nobody can successfully call it, ever. This means that there is a bug in this function, and it crashes too much. Or you might find out that `withdraw` might succeed even if one isn't an owner.


But if you're designing a safer smart contract language, shouldn't this be enforced by the language itself?

I never said it is. Hostility is the strategy: we should treat a hard fork attempt as an attack.
The attitude Bitcoin users have towards hard forks is important, as it affects consensus.
It's important for Bitcoin users to see a hard fork not as a democratic election process, not as a market process, but as an attack.
There is no market for attacks, that's the difference.
When you say that the market would decide, you admit that it's possible for a hard fork to succeed, and thus you admit that you might hedge your risks buy trading forked coins, thus making a fork more likely to succeed. The part you're missing is that _you're the part of the market_. You cannot just let "a market to decide", you must decide yourself: do you want Bitcoin to exist as a single ledger? If so, you must act accordingly.
You need to understand that when you talk about hard forks, you're sending a signal to others in the Bitcoin community. Particularly, you're sending a signal to speculators. If speculators see that Bitcoin users are ready to accept multiple versions of Bitcoin as currencies, they will be more willing to gamble on it, thus giving value to these alt-coins.


It's actually even easier: you can hard fork just by changing the code. But if you do that, you will be ridiculed. As ridiculous as it sounds, it's our first line of defence.
But a more resourceful attacker won't just go away.
I agree with you that we shouldn't pretend that hard forks cannot happen: we should talk about this possibility and prepare ourselves. But we should treat is an attack.
First of all, we shouldn't give attackers even shreds of legitimacy. We should call the forked chain an alt-coin, and if it's supporters call it Bitcoin, then just call them scammers. Essentially, they are making counterfeit bitcoins and claim those are real bitcoins. It's a fraud. Boycott any business which accepts alt-bitcoins: they are enabling a fraud. Report them to police. 
The only possible exception is exchanges: it might be actually beneficial to dump alt-bitcoins, and it's better to do it on a legitimate exchange. But we need to make sure that doesn't legitimize alt-bitcoins.
If this is an attack, it's acceptable to counter-attack. We should DDoS pools which mine alt-bitcoins. We should consider paying a premium to miners who mine real bitcoins to incentivize them. We should consider making a counter-attack pool which will reorg attackers' chain, making their alt-bitcoins easily double-spendable.
You say it was a mistake to call Bitcoin XT an alt-coin. But theymos's reaction helped to prevent a hard fork: Bitcoin XT have failed. And so did Bitcoin Classic. So this is effective, it works. We have a fragmented community, but we have a single ledger.


Yes, a threat always exist. There is also a threat of 51% attack, regulatory attack, etc. No investment is risk free.
But this doesn't mean we should invite attacks to test ourselves! You say that a hard fork is a serious threat. If it is, we should NOT try it out.
(As a sidenote, I do not care much about spin-offs, i.e. alt-coins which branch off the Bitcoin blockchain. Technically they are also hard-forks, but as long as they don't call themselves "Bitcoin", I'm fine with them, as they are no worse than alt-coins.)

Nobody is saying that 2 MB is inherently bad. 
(BTW, it's not "2 MB", it is 8 MB weight, i.e. blocks can be potentially 8000000 bytes big, which is kinda bad. Calling it "2 MB" is wrong and manipulative.)
What's bad is a particular fork which is planned, i.e. "the process and timing". People who are pushing 2x claim that NYA is final and do not want to discuss the alternatives. Thus there is no discussion. Once 2x fork dies out, a discussion can be restarted.
Also it makes sense to start this discussion only after data about SegWit use is collected. Do you prefer planning with incomplete information?

I'm curious why do you think that "keeping the network alive" is a good thing.
Let's consider two situations:

2. Network is shut down, 0% of users can transact, but 0% are under risk of double-spending.
Do you think it's better to allow unbounded financial loss (potentially, hundreds of millions dollars of stolen money) than to allow downtime while devs are fixing the implementation?
But it seems you don't understand how it works, if there was only geth and no parity, there would be no downtime, just quirky behavior.

The problem is that improvements to layer 1 are being blocked because of LN.
There is are many different proposals, but Bitcoin's "thought leaders" have decided that LN is the best solution, and now other proposals are not being considered.
Something similar happened before. User-defined tokens [could be introduced as a Bitcoin soft fork]( but our "thought leaders" have decided to do it through sidechains.
Now three years later sidechains are nowhere to be seen. Alt-coins have native way to do user-defined tokens. Bitcoin only has "L2" solutions which suck big time. Say thanks to people who were cheering for sidechains.
I expect something like that happening with LN. Alt-coins will find a good &amp; safe way to scale, while you will still be trying to get LN off the ground.
My point is, criticism is important. If you shit on what you think is a bad idea, you make room for better ideas.
LN is past idea stage, however, probably easier to wait and see how it works in practice than to discuss the theory.

When you talk about skills it makes sense to specify rarity. E.g. top 1 out of 10, or top one percentile.
Satoshi definitely wasn't just an average programmer. An average programmer can only code non-trivial things under guidance.
But top percentile skill might be enough for what Satoshi did. What I mean by that is that if we take a sample of 100 random C++ programmers, it's likely that at least one of them will have enough skill to implement Bitcoin all by himself.
So it's not an exceptionally rare skill level.

No, it doesn't. That money comes from depositors. Bank's books need to be balanced.
The "magic money" is what you have on your account, as it's not really money you have.
People say that banks create money when they make loans because that's how M1 money supply accounting works. E.g. 
1. Suppose bank starts with $1.
2. Alice deposits $100 into a bank. Now bank has $101 and Alice has $0. Since total amount didn't change, M1 is not updated.
3. Bank lends $100 to Bob. Now Bob has $100, but Alice thinks she also has $100, and bank only has $1 in cash reserves. So M1 supply is increased.
4. Bank cannot make any new loans until somebody else deposits money.
So the supply got increased because Alice _thinks_ she has money in the bank, while it's just bank's debt backed by Bob's bank.

If your computer is already compromised, it doesn't matter if you download correct binaries, as attacker already controls your machine. (Aside from obscure cases when browser was compromised but the rest of machine wasn't.)
Obviously, you shouldn't just trust keys you've just download from the internet. Ideally, you should meet relevant people (e.g. on conferences, it's not hard) and get their public keys in-person. Note that PGP supports web-of-trust, which means you only need to meet somebody who has developers' keys, not necessarily developers themselves.
E.g. suppose you meet Bob at a local Bitcoin meetup, and Bob have personally met Peter Todd at the conference, who have all developers keys signed. So unless Bob is the one who tries to attack you, you're safe.
Things are worse if you don't have time to validate things thoroughly, but the situation isn't hopeless.
If you simply compute sha256sum of the file you received and Google the hash, you should be able to find this hash on several different web sites. Attacker will have to modify all of these web sites to fool you.
Then you can also download PGP keys from github and verify your build using them: 
Multiple checks are additive, so for an attack to be unnoticed there needs to be a MASSIVE conspiracy.

No, I was thinking about multi-CPU configuration. There are also ways to share memory between multiple machines. [RDMA](
In multi-machine configuration it might make sense to do things differently, e.g. TxOut DB can be implemented as a distributed kv store. It might require more clever algorithm to avoid being bottlenecked by interconnect bandwidth.


It's just one way to implement this. Another is to record all spends in the same data structure/database, and then search for duplicates. No need to do it online, only before you about to commit changes.


Yes. There are two possible strategies:
1. query txouts over network
2. do extra work on every machine (every node builds TxOut DB for blocks being scanned, but only process a part of it)
What is better depends on what is the bottleneck. Say, if UTXO DB queries are the bottleneck, you can parallelise it nicely.

I think Satoshi just tried to consider a simple model of an attack, where attacker starts at a certain time and then either succeeds or fails. This is easy to calculate, and it gives you a result which is easy to interpret -- a probability of success.
If you consider an attack where attacker is continuously trying to mine a long chain in secret, then probability of success depends on time he spends on this. In this case it makes sense to consider the economic effect of the attack: i.e. wasted block rewards on unsuccessful attempts vs possible profit. This model is just more complex, and less understandable by people who are new to Bitcoin.
So I think that Satoshi was just trying to explain that he considers attack of the first kind, i.e. just one try. If Alice gives her address to Bob and will wait 1 week for Bob to make a payment, then Bob will be able to make multiple tries. So the probability of success depends on the length of time invoice is valid. Thus to get a simple, clean result we assume that invoice was valid for a negligible amount of time.
The attack you described makes it possible to do many tries even if invoice is valid for a negligible amount of time. The attack is valid, it's similar to [Finney attack]( except it works with arbitrary number of confirmations.
We don't know if Satoshi was aware of this kind of attacks, quite likely he wasn't. So that might be the reason why he wrote it like that. Or maybe he was aware of it, but didn't want to spend 3 pages describing different kinds of attacks.
Of course, Satoshi's paper wasn't a rigorous proof of Bitcoin security, it was more like an illustration, so this simplistic reasoning is permissible. More rigorous analysis was later done by Meni Rosenfeld in [Analysis of Hashrate-Based Double Spending]( where he pointed out that it's better to consider economic feasibility of an attack, rather than a probability of success. If you consider economic feasibility, it doesn't really matter if attacker tries just once or over certain time.
(BTW note that your attack works when invoice validity time is negligible, however, it also requires invoice generation time to be negligible too. E.g. if merchant gives an address 10 minutes after you request him, attacker's chances are greatly diminished. So this is another reason to NOT analyze this model: it becomes complex very fast. In the end feasibility argument still applies.)

Block size is just a wedge issue, it doesn't define the groups.
Personally, I'm in favor of a moderate block size increase. But I'm siding with a group you would call "small blockers". Why? Because I see that they are quite sane, they use reasoning to make decisions, and are very cautious (which is a good thing when it comes to security).
The other group is basically the opposite: people who are clueless and are proud of it; people who crave power; people who believe that marketing trumps security. I just cannot side with these people no matter how I like big blocks.
You can see people like Meni Rosenfeld advocating bigger blocks: 
Does that mean they belong to No fucking way.
So the division is basically "normal people" vs "fucktards".

While we are here, let's discuss "having the official protocol specification" vs "reference code is the specification".
Developers who are new to Bitcoin are often surprised or even outraged by a lack of official specification. They consider it a sign of network's immaturity.
Indeed, specifications are usually immensely useful for network protocols: when different systems disagree, one can just look up in specification and fix the offending implementation.
But the thing, this approach doesn't work for cryptocurrencies: at a point when there is a disagreement, there is already a serious risk of large financial loss.
Thus you need _prevent_ disagreement, not fix it after the fact.
Obviously, a specification written in English makes it impossible to prove that an implementation adheres to the specification, as English is often ambiguous, and you have to rely on human opinion anyway. (This is exactly what happened with this geth/Parity fork.)
So you gotta use formal specification, i.e. a specification written in a language computer understands. In other words, a specification must be in code.
The difference between programming language and specification languages is rather thing. It was [demonstrated]( that there is a correspondence between computer programs and mathematical proofs.
A program which exhibits no undefined behaviour can serve as a specification.

Are you aware of ByzCoin?
It is possible to establish BFT consensus between miners to enforce rules like that.
Most likely this was Satoshi's vision: secondary consensus layer to sync mempools and enforce replacement rules.


The most revolutionary part of Lightning is transaction replacement: a party who tries to spend old (replaced) transaction might be punished. This is basically an alternative to enforced consensus.
So anyway, Satoshi described bi-directional payment channels, which are equivalent to Lightning functionally, but Satoshi haven't figured out how to implement them in a secure way.

My only questions is whether there are programs simulating "random walk model" convergence and "emergent consensus". 
Simulating block propagation is easy, it takes maybe a couple of days to implement that e.g. as a Python script. It doesn't need to do anything with cryptography or actual data structures, just mock blocks and mock nodes.
If this simulation isn't done this clearly exposes BU people as charlatans.
Note that actual node software is completely irrelevant for high-level analysis. Using it would be like buying actual apples just to calculate "3 apples plus 7 apples".

What makes you think so?
BCH fork happened because there was a community supporting it, i.e. people who really hate Core/SegWit and are into alt-coins.
There is no "2x" community, as far as I can tell. Since Core rejects "2x", the hypothetical "2x" community are people who love SegWit, but hate Core. They do not exist.
Miners will mine chain which is more profitable, i.e. chain which has a community.


It will have mining power if it has users. There are no "miners", each miner decides for himself, and it will be more profitable to stay on chain which actually has users.

I'm talking about the situation where Bob will try to make a secret chain of blocks _before_ paying to Alice. It's exactly same as your scenario, except that he already has the address to send his coins to. (If Alice only takes orders in person, your method won't work since it will take time Bob to arrange the meeting, and his secret chain might expire by then. So "invoice validity" is just a simpler way to model that -- suppose he already had a meeting, got an address, now he just needs to mine a secret chain of blocks.)
Bob has many tries. Suppose Alice gave him invoice at block 123000 and it's valid until block 124000.
So Bob tries to mine block 123001 which includes his double-spend (pay to self). If he manages to mine that block before the rest of the network, he will continue trying making block 123002 on top of that, and so on.
But if network mines block 123001 before Bob does, it's better for Bob to abandon this try and start over, now trying to mine block 123002 with a double-spend.
And he has roughly 1000 tries.

B2X is completely unnecessary, it will be dead on arrival.
The only potential advantage B2X has over BCH is SegWit. 
But it's kinda ridiculous to use the system designed and advocated by Core devs which is NOT supported by Core devs. Completely illogical, inconsistent position.
That's like saying: "You guys are very smart and I trust the stuff you've made, but I disagree with you and have my own opinion".
People who still support B2X were either confused by rhetoric, or are BCH shills trying to further destabilize and harm the Bitcoin community. (The later is far more likely, as I've seen an influx of trolls spreading FUD.)

I noticed today that many people focus on availability of the network, rather than security. This completely misses the point of cryptocurrency.
The main purpose of cryptocurrency is to verify payments. If your node says that a transaction is fully confirmed, then in the case of a well-functioning cryptocurrency it should be confirmed for everybody and forever.
A corollary to this is that when something is not functioning properly it is better to fail than to show a confirmation which isn't true.

I find it remarkable that there are still people who defend PoW. PoW works in such a way that if price falls below a certain level miners stop mining and system loses its security, which might result in further drop of price, etc. So we are sitting on a bomb, basically.
And yet people don't want to hear about proof-of-stake. Yes, proof-of-stake has different trade-offs, but it can secure the blockchain. You can even combine PoW+PoS if you love PoW so much.

This appears to be based on a common misconception.
Banks do not really have any special way of "creating money": they borrow money from depositors and lend them to borrowers. This is something _any_ business (or, potentially, even an individual) can do, banks do not have any special powers.
The difference is that bank's debt is considered money, so when bank lends money total amount of money in the system increases. But this is just the way statistics is calculated.
So if you want to stop banks from creating money, just stop calling bank's debt money.
E.g. today you would say "I have $20,000 on a bank account". Then this $20,000 is counted as money bank have created.
If you instead say "Bank owes me $20,000", then it's just a debt.
This changes nothing on physical or mathematical level, it's just a change of labels.
If you want to stop banks from creating money you need to stop them from lending. But isn't that what banking business is about?
Perhaps there should be separate full-reserve banks which only manage accounts and fractional-reserve banks which also do lending. If you force all banks to go full-reserve, they'll compensate all the profit they got from lending with fees, and there will be no lending.

To generate an address, you need to generate a keypair.
Private key is a 256-bit random number. You can generate it yourself e.g. by throwing a dice or a coin. Then you can easily write it down on a sheet of paper. You don't even need a computer to generate a Bitcoin private key!
But then you need to fund it somehow, right? If you transfer your private key to a non-secure computer, your key might be stolen. 
So the problem of a secure wallet generation essentially boils down to a problem of generating an address from a private key.
This is actually quite simple. First you need to multiple elliptic curve's base point by a scalar: `d * G` where `d` is your private key (256-bit number) and `G` is secp256k1 base point (generator). As a result you get an EC point, which is a pair of 256-bit numbers.
Then you need Bitcoin address, it's something like this:
     hash = RIPEMD160(SHA256(encode_ec_point(d * G))

Strictly speaking, the only thing you need to perform on a secure computer is `d * G` multiplication. The rest can be done on regular computers (but you need cross-check it to ensure it doesn't give you the wrong number).
If you want a HD wallet you need to do more math, but that's still math.

Hardware wallet might be compromised in many ways.
It is NOT air gapped. So if its firmware is vulnerable, your money is gone.
You need to understand that "hardware wallet" doesn't really implement "Bitcoin" in hardware. It's just an ARM computer connected via USB.
It's more secure than a normal computer because it has much lower attack surface, but it's still a computer running software written in C. It absolutely CAN be vulnerable.
It might be also vulnerable to side channel attacks.
Also you gotta trust the company which produced the wallet. They might tell you stories about open source firmware, but in reality, you never know. So basically you trust people to not put in a vulnerability which might earn them billions of dollars. That's an interesting bet.
Now if you use air-gapped computer to generate keys, you have a very different threat model. Even if software is compromised, it cannot do damage.
To generate a cold wallet, you essentially just need to perform certain mathematical operations. It is essentially impossible to compromise math in such a way that it won't be easily detectable. So you don't have to trust anyone in this case.

Bitcoin blockchain is simply not designed to handle anything but Bitcoin payments. You can do other things in a hackish way, but it usually sucks in one way or another.
So it's kinda natural that people implement other blockchains for things other than Bitcoin payments.

Potentially, yes.
But the cartel &amp; governments aren't stupid. They understand that if they go too far, they will lose control: somebody can hard fork Bitcoin, and if a forked version is objectively better, then people will flock to it.
So they must maintain at least some of features which make Bitcoin great. For example, finite supply is a sacred cow. Libertarians want sound money, they do not want secret money.


I'm not talking about PayPal level of centralization. I'm talking about a situation where it superficially remains decentralized, but de-facto isn't. I.e. Bitcoin is controlled by a mining cartel. 
It might arise naturally: big pools might create some improved synchronization protocol which virtually eliminates orphans. All big miners will join those pools. Small pools not connected to that network will be useless, as they'll have much higher orphan rate.

They need every block header, but only merkle path to few transactions they care about.
A full collection of block headers is 35 MB now. Merkle path + transaction is on scale of 4 KB.
So, unless wallet sends and receives a lot of transactions, traffic requirements will be dominated by block headers.
35 MB is very significant for people on 2G mobile connections. Adding an extra field to a block header will increase it by 14 MB, which is quite significant.

Your definition is inadequate. SPV is described as an interactive process, not as a non-interactive proof.
A proper SPV client is supposed to keep track of the chain with most work it have seen so far.
Obviously, making sure that the block is the part of the main chain is much more secure than simply requiring a certain amount of work to be done on top of a certain block.
Satoshi also mentioned that SPV security can be further strengthened:

Without doubt, PoW-proofs used in merged mined sidechains were inspired by SPV, but they _aren't_ SPV, as SPV implies a lot of other stuff, including a possibility of a fallback.

Cryptocurrencies allow people to control their money by cryptographic means. Particularly, by signing a transaction using their _private key_.

A cryptocurrency needs to be big to be strong. There is a reason why hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on Bitcoin mining. A new decentralized cryptocurrency won't be secure.

To maximize the expected value of profit you need to take value into account.
E.g. suppose there are only two options: $100 and $1000. Suppose that you estimate that chances are 50:50, so there is no difference. But expected value of $1000 choice is 10x higher than of $100 choice.

Huh? I don't think so. The most common issue which type systems solve is that unverified scripts can crash at the run time, e.g. by calling invalid operation (trying to add a number and a string), or violating some constraint.
FYI Ethereum isn't Turing complete either, as each operation consumes gas and so total number of operations is bounded. I don't think anyone have ever had a problem with hanging EVM scripts.
Static analysis can be used to prove that a program never crashes, never violates certain constraints, etc. This is something you want in a smart contracts language.

There are much better ways to do it like Bitcoin-ng and Byzcoin. It **is** possible to make mainnet nearly real-time without crutches like Lightning, but it's quite complex and you need some tradeoffs.
(The problem with Lightning is that it doesn't allow you to send money whoever you want whenever you want.)
I think BitShares is best-in-class now with 3 second confirmations. I tried trading on BitShares exchange, and it feels like real-time.
BitShares decentralization is quite limited, but I think it's OK if there is another layer which provides long-term immutability.

Do you know that the reward will be just 75 satoshi in 96 years? Do you think that mining can be sustained with just 75 satoshis?
Are you aware of the fact that Bitcoin security is directly linked to the block reward?
If miners are rational, making a block cannot cost more than the block reward. Thus if there are no fees and block subsidy is just 75 satoshis, it costs less than 75 satoshis to make a block.
A payment can be considered secure only when the cost of rewriting the blockchain is higher than the payment value.  Thus it will take `1/0.00000075 ~= 1333334` blocks. It will take 25 fucking years to confirm 1 BTC transaction!
If you think my math is broken, try reading [Analysis of Hashrate-Based Double Spending]( This article is cited by 43 other academic papers, very well known and reviewed. 
On the page 13 you can see Table 2: The maximal safe transaction value, in BTC, as a function of the attacker’s hashrate q and the number of confirmations n. This assumes 25 BTC block reward.
Let's plug 75 satoshis into it. If an attacker has 10% of total hashrate and merchants waits 6 confirmations, safe value is `168000 * (0.00000075 / 25) = 0.005` BTC. 
But this is a non-problem, according to you. A fee market will only be necessary in 100 years, thus in 95 years we can all survive with zero fees and 75 satoshi block reward. Just wait 25 years for a confirmation of 1 BTC payment, what's the problem??!

The limit is specified in UAH, before the devaluation in 2014-2015 it was more like $25000, which is more than an average Ukrainian citizen has in savings, so it was quite adequate.
If you happen to have more, you can spread your money between several banks, or put it into a government bank which has unlimited coverage by law (and hope that the government won't back on its promise).
People who too much money might be better off seeking alternative investments like real estate, government bonds, gold (in a safe), Bitcoin, etc.
I assume situation is similar in other 3rd world countries, so I think people are underestimate Bitcoin's potential as a store of value: in these countries we don't have no-brainer options for preserving one's wealth, there's always some hassle and risk (the government might fuck you in an arbitrary way, and will resist attempts to move capital elsewhere), so Bitcoin is quite viable as a _mainstream_ store of value asset.

Later law specified that this license is impossible to get.
If it was possible to use dollars for payments then all online electronics store would have quoted all prices in dollars. Currently they take currency risks, and on top of that they have to buy currency to restock goods, which is quite problematic in Ukraine.


No, the law says that only UAH can be used for payments within the country.
In 90s national currency was a joke (hyperinflation) and people used USD for payments. Or at least quoted price in USD.
When they fixed the hyperinflation issue, they enacted this law to stabilize the currency: it required payments to be made in national currency, and also prices MUST be quoted in national currency as well.
For some time we had prices quoted in "agreed units" which is wink-wink for USD, but I think that became forbidden too. And it worked: exchange rate was stable 2000-2008 (with some minor fluctuations, actually UAH became stronger on two occasions).
Other currencies can be used for "external economic activity", like selling stuff to nonresident companies, but there are strict regulations on how it's done. One fun thing is that you cannot withdraw dollars you received on your bank account as cash.

There is nothing special about blocks: transactions within a block are dependency-ordered, so you have to consider inter-transaction dependencies in any case.
Transaction inputs can be connected in parallel (regardless whether they come from one block or multiple):
1. Give each thread a set of transactions to process.
2. Thread deserializes transactions and validates signatures. Then adds transaction ID to a hash table (one table per thread).
3. After all threads have finished step  we can start connecting inputs. For every input, we should determine if it belongs to a transaction from blocks being processed, using hash tables mentioned on step  Then we either use a transaction which is already in memory, or get a previous output from the database. (Note that it doesn't matter whether transaction belongs to the same blocks.)
4. New outputs are written to the database after step  is completed.

What do you mean by that?
Suppose that there is no explicit block size limit.
But each node has implicit max block size it can process. E.g. I'm pretty certain that no node can handle 1 TB blocks.
This implicit limit is different for different nodes: some will choke on 100 MB blocks, other on 1 GB blocks and so on.
So by producing sufficiently large blocks you can partition the network.

Bitcoin makes banks obsolete. In theory, at least.
Some people thought that banks have some useful function besides keeping track of who owns how much.
But 0.01% rate illustrates that whatever useful function they have, it's not really related to accounts. If they were actually doing something useful with that money they would have paid some real interest. But 0% interest indicates that banks don't really need people's money. (The central bank made money so abundant that banks no longer care about liquidity and things like that.)
So we can safely decouple accounts from banks without affecting the economy.

Same shit. You can also say the global variable reads/writes are "side effects". It not a question how it's called, it's a question of how it's used.
If your language allows multiple interleaved reads/writes, you can get into a problem, especially if data can be "cached" in variables. E.g. consider this:
     (with-read &lt;foo&gt;
       (check &lt;foo&gt; data)
       (bar) ; updates &lt;foo&gt;
       (baz &lt;foo&gt;)
       (quux)) ; reads &lt;foo&gt;
There are several non-obvious interactions here: baz gets &lt;foo&gt; which doesn't reflect the most recent changes, i.e. possibly stale; quux gets an updated version of &lt;foo&gt; which is different from what baz got, and also it bypasses the check.
It doesn't matter if it's a "global variable" or "side effect" if result is the same.
It's definitely possible to solve it on the language level, by making it more restrictive. E.g. writes can occur only after a call is made, so they cannot influence reads in any way.

I really doubt that.
To implement Bitcoin, one needs to know not only a programming language, but also concepts like networking, persistence, serialization, etc. One needs to choose libraries, etc. Newbies usually struggle with this, as this concepts are rarely covered by books, and topics are rather controversial anyway.
So unless Satoshi read "How to implement Bitcoin" book which covered everything from (networking, cryptography, BDB, serialization, GUI...) he probably had some prior programming experience.
But I don't think Satoshi was a professional programmers: professional C++ programmers used very different coding style in 2008, not to mention they would have started with better modularity.
Satoshi used MFC coding style popular in late 90s/early 2000s. E.g. `C` prefix for class names, Hungarian notation (`pszName`). I don't think there is a book which teaches MFC style together with STL and Boost.
More likely that Satoshi learned C++ in late 90s/early 2000s, maybe when he was getting education or something like that. C++ was quite popular at that time.
Then yes, maybe he read a high-quality C++ book to bring himself up to date with new stuff and best practices just before starting to code Bitcoin.
Another interesting thing is that Satoshi implemented a Forth interpreter for extensibility/contracts. I don't think a newbie programmer would even know something like this is possible.

Because existing ones do not satisfy their requirements.


You say it like it's a trivial thing. It's not. Bitcoin, specifically, isn't designed for layers to be built on top of it. Building layers is possible, in principle, but you still have a lot of trade-offs.
For example, oftenwise blockchains are used for proof-of-publication, and Bitcoin blockchain only allows you to post minuscule amounts of data.


The only thing Bitcoin blockchain is proven for is sending Bitcoin payments, and it's proven that sometimes you need to wait hours or days for your transaction to be confirmed.
Ethereum is more friendly to hosting arbitrary applications, but it's anything but proven, for anything.

There are almost no people who don't want to increase the capacity. The question is only how much and how, people disagree about trade-offs because they see priorities differently.


Prioritization isn't censorship. As I mention, Bitcoin used to have different prioritization, and somehow that was OK.
It's possible to change miners incentives by changing block reward function, so any desired prioritization can be made incentive-compatible.
We want to lower priority of repeatedly sent transaction. The logic is very simple: suppose Alice have just made transaction 10 minutes ago, while Bob haven't made any transactions for a week. When it's the next turn to confirm a transaction, we should give priority to Bob's transaction. If Alice's transaction fits, it can be processed too. But she should wait, she already got her chance.
This isn't just about flood attacks, many exchanges use inefficient wallets. They could use less block space if they were batching sends. There are other tricks like transaction aggregation and [cut-through](

Not true, this is not how people define "blockchain technology". Blockchain technology requires a consensus mechanism.
If you want to see how serious academics who study distributed consensus see blockchain technology, check [this](
 * First, classical-style protocols such as PBFT and Byzantine-Paxos confirm transactions
quickly in the normal case; but these protocols are notoriously complicated, making implementation,
reconfiguration, and maintenance relatively difficult especially in a large-scale setting.
 * Second, **blockchain-style protocols, represented by Nakamoto’s original blockchain,
are a new breakthrough in distributed consensus**: these protocols are conceptually simple and

Forking IS possible, that's true. But that shouldn't be an option. It's not a valid option if you want Bitcoin to be _the_ cryptocurrency.
_Technically_, if you remove your head, headache goes away. But a guillotine is not a valid headache cure.
A contentious hard fork should be seen as an attack, similar to 51% attack. It is certainly possible, but we are doing everything to prevent it. Hundreds of millions of dollars are invested in preventing it.
So any reasonable investor will understand that there is a risk, but it's fairly minimal. There is no such thing as a 100% risk-free investment. 
Now if you bring hard forks as a mean of resolving conflicts within the community, that's a whole different story. If people in the Bitcoin community think that way, then we no longer have a global ledger, we have a bullshit game of mining.
So my point is that this way of thinking erodes Bitcoin's vision.
I trade alt-coins for shits and giggles, but in my view Bitcoin is special, it is ours most serious attempt to make a truly global currency, like a digital gold. **Please don't fuck with this.**
If there are two bitcoins, it cannot be gold. There is only one gold. Gold doesn't fork.
We have all reasons to be hostile to those who try to fork Bitcoin, as that is a threat to our vision of Bitcoin as a global currency.

Why do you think it's a good idea for him to invest into Bitcoin if he doesn't understand how it works?
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:11:50


What do you mean by that? Mathematics has nothing to do with PoW.
Mathematics can't secure anything.


Bitcoin is fundamentally a cryptoeconomic system. It DOES NOT WORK if you don't consider incentive structures (i.e. miners' profits and incentives).


A company who invested into making PoW chips and mining facilities can reinvest profits to build even more efficient chips and bigger facilities.  Which is what happened, basically. Bitmain have been dominating the mining scape for a while.

There's proof-of-stake, but it has different security characteristics. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 11:23:13


The talk like this was cute back in 2011.
But now it's no longer theoretical. There were many successful double-spend attacks on alt-coins which use exact same algorithms and incentive structure as Bitcoin. So now we know not just theoretically but also empirically that PoW by itself does not inherently prevent double-spending.
Just few days ago Bitcoin Gold was successfully attacked: 
Likewise, Verge: 


If the drop is just 14.6% then it might be quite profitable to double-spend. If you anticipate bigger drop it might be more profitable to short Bitcoin.


This in an extremely naive view. What is a miner? In Satoshi's simplistic case, it was node = miner = block producer.
But starting from 2011, we differentiate owners of hardware from block producers. Very often it's not the same entity. Pool produces blocks, and hardware owner effectively just rents his hashpower to a pool.
There's also Nicehash service which implements an auction which automatically assigns hashpower to the highest bidder.
So there could be 100 independent equipment each owning 1% of total hashrate. If e.g. 60 of them rent their hashpower through a service like Nicehash, an attacker can use that to perform double-spend or a similar kind of attack. So it's a matter of a simple calculation -- how much an attacker can earn through a double-spend, how much he needs to pay to rent the hashpower and how much he earns by shorting Bitcoin.


If you trust a single entity -- sure. (Although it would be beneficial to get cryptographically-signed receipts which can prove your position.)
But don't you think that trusting 100 entities to not collude makes more sense than to trust just a single entity?
And if you believe that 100 entities can collude, what makes you think Bitcoin block producers won't? 5 of them is enough to get a supermajority.

OP talks about enterprises adopting a blockchain, right? I actually work in this sphere, as I'm a CTO of a blockchain tech startup.
So the most common problem which enterprises want to solve using a blockchain is that some sort of a shared database which could save them money just doesn't exist. It's not about replacing existing stuff, it's about creating new.
It's easy to say "you just need to set up a central database", but it's very hard to organize when you're dealing with a multitude of competing enterprises. It's much easier for them to use a piece of software than to create a consortium to establish a centralized database.


It's essentially the simplest and most secure way to do it. I'm not saying you need to put large documents into the blockchain, but typically you need more than a hash.


The problem is that such a thing doesn't exist. Note that it needs to be 100% reliable. It's just easier to use blockchains which already do exist.
I would argue that a reliable &amp; secure globally replicated file system is essentially the same thing as a blockchain. At least, right now it's not clear.


Freenet is not reliable, there is no guarantee that information is stored permanently.
If some hash's preimage is not known, it might have disastrous consequences. As Peter Todd puts it: "In short, Factom and systems like it rely on trusted third parties who can put you in a position where you can’t prove you did not commit fraud." This applies to distributed filesystems too. 


1. Documents don't need to be large, 1 KB is probably sufficient if we deal with optimized formats.
2. Doesn't need to be million-fold redundant either, 5x replication can be sufficient, if you do it properly.
If you put a hash into a blockchain _only after_ it was replicated to N semi-trusted nodes, that would work. But that requires non-trivial infrastructure.

No, but miners might choose different prioritization methods.

People who call it spam are using a wrong term.
More correct term is flood attack: send a plenty of data to deny service for others. A more general term is denial-of-service attack.
The fact that somebody pays for it is irrelevant. Let's consider some examples.
Suppose you have e-commerce server hosted on AWS. I don't want people to be able to buy from you, so I buy a bunch of AWS instances to flood your server with dummy requests. I pay a full price of AWS service, just like you, but you will probably be still unhappy with what I do. Because what I'm doing is a DoS attack, it really doesn't matter how much it costs. So most likely you will complain to Amazon, and most likely they will ban me for doing this, because it is a violation of ToS.
Now there is no Bitcoin ToS, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't qualify attacks as attacks.


The question is whether one have intentionally caused this congestion. It can be answered by analyzing transaction patterns.

Obviously, cryptocurrencies are much more fragile than metals. First, there are systemic risks:
1. Cryptography
    * There's **no** mathematical proof that ECDSA is secure \*; for all we know it might be broken in a couple of years; in the best case scenario, there will be time to upgrade, but old wallets might be gone
    * Likewise SHA-256 second pre-image resistance is not guaranteed, and that 
2. Network / blockchain / PoW
   * Bitcoin relies on miners having incentive to maintain it, i.e. _profit_ from honestly mining Bitcoin must be higher than profit derived from attacking/destroying  Bitcoin \*\*
   * There's also a risk of centralization: miners might team up and implement some global blacklist, effectively destroying coins of users they don't like (e.g. suspect terrorists, enemies of the state, criminals, etc)
3. Software
   * a serious bug in widespread Bitcoin node and wallet software might result in a large-scale theft and destruction
4. Government
   * governments might ban mining or using cryptocurrencies 
Second, there are risks which affect one's personal cryptocurrency stash:
1. Theft via software exploit. Gold can be stolen too, but to do that attacker must be physically near it, which makes it risky. Bitcoins can be stolen from remote, e.g. from a different country.
2. Accidental destruction: it's way to easy to screw up, e.g. damage your hardware wallet, back up and so on. It's not possible to accidentally destroy one's gold (aside from boating incidents, of course).
\*: In fact, this proof is currently impossible, mathematicians &amp; computer scientists can't even prove P=/=NP which  is required for public key cryptography to be secure.
\*\*: Note that profits is not the same as revenues. Bitcoin miners generate about $5B worth of bitcoins a year now. That's a lot. But the bulk of that some goes into energy and equipment costs. Due to competition the profit margin can further get decreased to mere few percent. So suppose at some point profit margins will drop to 2%, for example. In that case there'll be only $100M at stake, and it's not a huge price to pay to take Bitcoin down. (Note that the attacker can profit from shorting Bitcoin, from promoting his own cryptocurrency, etc.)

Proof-of-existence prevents back-dating, but it allows multiple conflicting versions of a document to exist. 
Peter Todd provides several examples [here]( 


Note in these three cases it's enough to publish triples `(pubkey, subject, hash)`. You're supposed to receive an actual document from the owner of the pubkey, and he cannot provide a document corresponding to a particular hash, you're supposed to assume that he's fraudulent.
Peter also [compares]( proof-of-publication to the Torrens Title System. You can replace a "central registry of deeds" with a blockchain-based proof-of-publication.
In this case posting a hash is not enough, posting full details is required. (Or, rather, posting just a hash is much less robust.)

Just to clarify, I don't know anything about T0 implementation, but there is a number of open source private blockchains, e.g. Parity (Ethereum-based), Hyperledger fabric, Chain.
It is pretty similar to Bitcoin: every transaction in a block is signed by the owner of an account, and a node will reject a block which has invalid transactions. Thus one node cannot fool another node as it cannot modify transactions without violating signatures.
So, for example, suppose there are several nodes which are run by independent companies. One admin went rogue and corrupted state of the node it controls. He can corrupt local database state, but other nodes will do full validation and won't be affected by this corruption.


They are often called "consortium" or "permissioned" blockchains for this reason, "private" isn't clear enough.
In a properly installed &amp; configured consortium blockchain there should be no SPOF.
I won't be surprised if T0 has complete control over the system. But even in this case there might be some value in blockchain architecture, as participants might receive cryptographic proofs and thus can quickly detect if something goes wrong.


Typically some variant of PBFT is used, i.e. a quorum of signer nodes needs to sign a block for it to be considered valid.
E.g. if you have 10 signer nodes (each of which is run by an independent company) a block needs to be signed by 7 nodes. In this case a system can tolerate up to 3 Byzantine failures.
Also, anchoring can be used, i.e. a hash of produced blocks (or individual transactions, if there are no blocks) and/or state is written into a public blockchain, e.g. Bitcoin blockchain. Once it's confirmed, even collusion of all signer nodes cannot change prior state.
This means that even a configuration with just one signer node can be somewhat secure: it might be DoSed, but an attacker cannot change transactions which are already confirmed by Bitcoin blockchain.
From the article it looks like T0 uses anchoring.

I think you're confusing Bitcoin Classic with Bitcoin Unlimited.
Classic just bumps block size to 2 MB, as you described in option A.
Unlimited is some crazy shit which changes how Bitcoin consensus works... It's no longer a simple "chain with most work" rule, it's much more complicated. They call it "emergent consensus", like a consensus might potentially emerge...
So one reason to prefer SegWit over Unlimited is that SegWit only changes block size, while Unlimited changes how Bitcoin works, and not in a good way...


Not true, SegWit blocks are actually bigger, it is just that it's possible to convert them to 1 MB blocks for old clients.

Not particularly easy either.
 I tried mining in the autumn of 2010 on a CPU. The calculator said I need to mine for 200 days to have 50% of mining a block. So I turned it off after few days. There were no pools back then.
Several months later pools started to appear, so it was much easier to mine -- however, my CPU only got me few satoshis, which I couldn't even withdraw as minimal fee was on scale of 0.01 BTC.
Wiki says that GPU miners started to appear in the autumn of 2010. Not sure why I didn't use them -- perhaps they were too obscure, or I didn't have compatible hardware/software.
So it was only easy if you happened to have a new gaming computer.
On the other hand, I don't think it was super hard to buy BTC if you hang out on the forum -- since it was a small community, people trusted each other.

Do you understand that decentralization is a trade-off? A decentralized cryptocurrency will never be as fast/cheap/good as a centralized one, because decentralization requires additional resources and imposes additional constraints.
A centralized or semi-decentralized cryptocurrency will be good enough for most people, so why would they accept sacrifices necessary for decentralization?
So imagine that Bitcoin 2.0 is controlled by a cartel of miners, which is controlled by governments. For example, it might implement block lists and things like that.
For an average person who uses it for payments, it is good enough. Fast payments, low fees, low hassle. He just don't gives a fuck that Julian Assange cannot receive payments.
Now imagine that somebody starts Bitcoin 3.0, which is more decentralized. It will be immediately attacked by the cartel, governments... and end users will not like it, because  it has higher fees and payments are slower.
So a centralized Bitcoin is basically the end of cryptocurrencies: all other cryptocurrencies will be marginalized and, possibly, criminalized. Governments will say that they are only used by terrorists, drug dealers and child pornographers. And that would be partly true, because most other groups will be fine with Bitcoin-Central.
You and Roger Ver do not understand that Bitcoin is not a software project, it is a complex ecosystem. You cannot just release a software update to change something, you need to make sure that all actors will accept it. Thus you also need to consider game theory.

I live in one of "red" countries (Ukraine). People here are well aware of inflation, and thus avoid using local currency (UAH, Ukrainian hryvna) for savings.
The law requires people and businesses to use local currency for payments. Thus it is impossible to use Bitcoin for payments (I guess that's what you mean by "main currency") without violating laws. (Just like it is impossible to use US dollars and so on.)
However, it's fairly easy to convert UAH to US dollars or euros, so that's what people do. Typically they keep savings in USD and EUR. Some people also invest in gold and real estate.
Still, it's kinda impractical to do a conversion every day due to fees and general inconvenience, so generally people keep some UAH as pocket money for buying groceries and whatnot (\*), while keeping larger sums in USD and EUR. 
While yearly inflation is significant (about 20%), it hardly matters when you only keep a relatively small sum in local currency and spend it quickly.
People could use Bitcoin for savings, in principle, but it has several disadvantages compared to US dollars: higher conversion fees, higher volatility, cybersecurity risks, etc.
But an important advantage is that Bitcoin doesn't depend on banks and government, and cannot be stole if you do it right. Ukrainian banking system is very unstable, so this is an important factor. So it might make sense to put a fraction of one's savings into Bitcoin if he can secure them properly.
( \*: If one is paranoid about inflation, he can get a USD debit card from Ukrainian bank and use it to buy groceries, etc. Bank will do the conversion automatically. But it charges a conversion fee.)

In this case the delivery man is responsible for execution of a 'smart contract'.
However, what if it's an empty box? Or broken item?
Actually here in Ukraine we have a deliver service which works exactly like this: They allow the buyer to unbox an item and send money to the seller only when the buyer is satisfied. (If he is not, the box is returned to the seller.) They work with cash, though, so it's not like "the smart contract" really adds that much, it can work just as a service provided by the deliver service.
With a Bitcoin smart contract you actually have a problem that the price of Bitcoin can go up or down 10% while the item is being delivered.

Different countries just have different salary rates. They are a result of complex economic processes and aren't always a result of "economic instability".
For example, countries in Eastern Europe have lower salaries than countries in Western Europe. That doesn't mean they have "unstable economies", their economies just still have room to grow, but it takes many decades to get there.
UK economy suffered from brexit, so it wasn't very stable this year, but UK salaries are still way higher than salaries in Poland, for example, so it makes sense for some people from Poland to move to UK to be able to earn more.
While, on the other hand, people from Ukraine are happy to work in Poland.
Movement of labor helps to reduce the differences.
E.g. suppose a person doesn't want to accept a relatively low salary in Mexico and moves to US. This means that Mexican employers have to pay more to attract employees. If that guy sends money home, that makes Mexico overall wealthier. Also he might learn new skills in US and move back to Mexico, bringing these skills with him.
All these things help to make Mexico more prosperous, as it gets healthier labor market, more capital and more productive work force.

Yes, mBTC is really awkward. People tried to make it a thing back in 2013, and it didn't work. It's long and hard to pronounce, and looks like a derivative unit.
Bits actually have a chance, I think. It's a very short name. Used to be a name of denomination, so it's already time-tested.
And the story that BitCoin is made out of bits makes intuitive sense. Like, you can either buy the whole Coin, or just bits of it.
The only problem with bits is that satoshis are more widely used, e.g. on tech sites. If you can convince Blockchain.Info to switch from satoshis to bits this might be a decided matter. I don't think people would complain because it's very easy to convert from satoshis to bits and back.

Why would somebody do that if they can do an ICO and sell $10 million worth of tokens?
There's already a bunch of such attempts. The first was [LaZooz]( It was pretty legit, as far as I can tell, but failed to get anything close to a critical mass needed to make it happen.
Then there was Arcade City. It was organized by some weird dude who was like a pathological liar. He managed to get some attention by rebelling against Uber, made some prototype app, then did an ICO. But people figured out he's sort of a scammer so it didn't work well...
So his team made another project called Swarm City, which is more-or-less legit. But they lost a lot of money they collected from ICO because of Parity multi-sig wallet bug, so they don't have much budget to execute. Also it seems like their programmers are a bit "alternatively gifted", so to speak.

Let's suppose the following: 
 * a miner (mining pool) uses a standard behavior, he starts mining on top of a block only after it is downloaded and validated
 * validation takes negligible time
 * miner has 8 Mbit/s connection
It takes 1 second to download 1 MB using 8 Mbit/s connection. Thus on average miner spends 1 second out of 600 mining on top of an old block while new one is being downloaded, and if he happens to generate a block during this time, it's likely to be orphaned. Hence his orphan rate is on scale of 1/600, that is, 0.17%. (His blocks might be also orphaned because he uploads them relatively slowly, that number should be also on this scale but hard to predict as it depends on topology.)
0.17% isn't much, also on the 1 second time scales propagation latency effects kick in, so decreasing block size below 1 MB won't proportionally decrease the orphan rate.
Now if we increase allowed block size this 'slow connection' miner will have higher orphan rate, so he has an incentive either to start cheating (SPV mining) or join a bigger mining pool instead of mining himself.
Why do we care about miners with slow connections? Well in some parts of the world faster connections are prohibitively expensive, so if we cater only to those with faster connections mining might concentrate in few areas with cheap electricity and fast connections.
But miners are already SPV-mining? Some of them do, indeed, but it's not yet a norm.

Hashpower is directly related to the value of block rewards if we assume that miners are rational.
All chains which have same PoW will pay approximately the same number of dollars per hash. Imagine it is not true, i.e. chain X1 pays more than chain X2. Then if miners are rational, miners from chain X2 can switch to mine X1 to increase their profits. This will increase difficulty on chain X1 (thus decreasing how much it pays per hash) and decrease difficulty on chain X2. 
If price is the same, then the total amount of hashing will be proportional to total value of block rewards (including fees) on that chain, which itself is proportional to price.

Perhaps this: 
There is a number of different protocols, each has its own doc.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:11:26


Bitcoin uses cryptographic proofs in two cases:
1. When distributing a block, block header proves that miner committed to a particular list of transactions (as well as previous blocks) when he was doing proof-of-work. This allows Bitcoin node to be sure that data it received is exactly the same as produced by miners and cannot be modified in any way. In full-node security model this is THE ONLY proof used.
2. When SPV client receives a payment, it needs to know that it's confirmed. Thus it receives Merkle path which proves that a transaction with certain output was included into the blockchain (output is the coin which was received by the wallet). Together with block header chain, this proves that payment was confirmed.
These are the only proofs which are used by Bitcoin wallets, and neither is weakened by SegWit.
Do you claim that there's another kind of proof? Where it is? Where is it used? Where's code?
Or do you claim that SegWit somehow weakens two proofs I mentioned?

This is true if you consider only profit per block.
However, some parties might more complex strategies, e.g. they don't mind _losing money_ in the short-term if that will give them higher pay-offs in the long term.


How many full nodes do you run and how do you use them?
I run three nodes which index the blockchain to serve data to thin clients (similar to how Electrum works). Storage definitely is a problem.


Well, for example, a cartel of banks will run a mining operations which will flood the blockchain with spam making it bulky and unreliable and discouraging people from running full nodes or whatever.
This is a problem for SPV clients too because SPV get information about unspent outputs from full nodes which scan the blockchain. If the blockchain will become huge full nodes will cease to provide this service.
So in the end we might end up with few web wallets like Coinbase and Blockchain.info, companies which will be able to run powerful hardware to index the blockchain. (Although I have doubts about Blockchain.info, it looks like they have problems even now, even though they got $30M investment.)

Obviously it's a trade-off. 4 MB is considered to be safe. There is also a paper supporting this. I think we should get more recent data based on after-SegWit usage before going further.


No, that can be trivially used by block size defaults enforced by miners without any consensus adjustments. The problem was that some people tried using blockchain as a data store, and it was possible to push up to 32 MB data in one block.


This attack barely costs anything -- attacker will still get block reward, he will only lack fees. Also he suffers higher orphan rate.

Forget Script, consider simple 2-of-2 multisig. If transaction ID depends on transaction signature, then one of parties can change transaction ID by choosing different K. ECDSA allows that.
So unless we switch to a different signature scheme, the only way to fix malleability is to make transaction ID to depend only on payload but not signature.
It's ridiculous that there are people against this. Obviously, identifier of a payment should depend on payment itself rather than on how it's signed.

If UTXO set size is, say, 100 GB, it won't fit in my computer's memory. And you need random lookups to verify a block. So yes, I won't be able to run a full node on my computer if UTXO set size hits high values.


Some miners accept a big block and start mining on top of it. Other miners don't accept it and keep mining on top of the old block. Some nodes accept a big block. Others don't.
So you have one group of miners mining on top of block A, and another mining on top of block B. This increase orphan rate one of the blocks mined by these miners will be orphaned.
You also have a split among non-mining nodes.

You can do a lot of interesting things with these big blocks.
Suppose you know that a merchant uses a Bitcoin full node on powerful hardware and a gigabit network connection. While most miners in China use modest hardware and slow connection.
So you mine a huge block and feed it to that node. It will easily eat and process that block. But it will take a lot of time for this block to propagate to miners, so it will be orphaned with a high probability.
This way you can do 1 confirmation double-spend attacks.
Furthermore, you can try to induce a fork: some miners will quickly process a block and will start mining on top of it, while the rest of miners will keep mining on top of the old block. So this can result in a long sequence of orphans.

Let's do a thought experiment: suppose 99% of Bitcoin users are just passively holding.
This means that price is decided by 1% of users. So e.g. suppose that 1% of users dump Bitcoin for some unstable shitcoins. Bitcoin price plummets. Then this unstable shitcoin suffers from some vulnerability and its price plummets too.
So in the end alt-coin holders win.
So if you are a Bitcoin holder, you should proactively protect your investment by dumping free shitcoins.
This isn't semantics, this is game theory.
If you do not know which coin is better then you do not understand properties of the coin, and thus should not hold coins at all.

Miners continue mining on top of the old block before a new one is being downloaded/processed, so you might consume some bandwidth this way, but you won't stop others from mining.
You might do more damage with smaller blocks. E.g. suppose that 4 GB block can be processed by 95% of miners, while 5% will reject it because it doesn't fit into memory. So now there is a fork, and you can do double-spending against nodes which are on low-memory fork.

You have problems with logic. There are two options:
1. We can trust miners to not make blocks too big. Then we don't need consensus block size limit.
2. We do not trust miners, as they might make blocks too big. Then we need consensus block size limit, it matters.
So it either matters or not. Satoshi thought it does. So if it matters, it also matters what it is. It must be low enough to prevent possible abuse.
Peter Todd studied block propagation, [see here]( The important thing from there is that bigger blocks can be used by large miners to reduce small miner profits and kick them out of business. So we should be careful with block size.


It's enough for miners to be rational. They don't have to be honest (altruistic).


Well, miners can create large blocks without being in majority (if protocols allow that). A minority of miners can do some damage.
Also worth noting that difference between an attack and undesired behavior is a matter of opinion. For example, AntPool sometimes mines empty blocks. Is that undersirable? Yes, I think, everyone can agree that it's not good. But is that an attack? Who knows.
So imagine that protocol allows bigger blocks, and AntPool and other big pools start pumping block size up. Is that an attack? Are they evil miners?
I think this is better described as an issue with protocol which allows **rational** miners to harm smaller miners.
It seems you got caught in the false dichotomy:
1. if miners are benevolent, then they can't do no wrong, and we should allow them to control the protocol
2. if miners are not benevolent, they must be evil, and then everything is lost, so the only option is 
But this is not true. Miners might be not benevolent, but rational. That is, they aren't interested in attacking Bitcoin. But if protocol allows them to boost their profits with minimal or no risk, they will.
This is how you should look at it if you're designing a cryptocurrency protocol: your protocol should only incentivize behavior which is good for the network, and should disallow harmful or undesirable behavior.


Wrong. Suppose you rent hash power enough to mine 100 blocks within a week. It will give you 100*12.5 = 1250 BTC, and it will cost you approximately 1250 BTC. This is a result of economic equilibrium. It might cost you something more than 1250 BTC because there are also various fees and miners want some premium, but not much. It might be as little as 1251 BTC. In this case renting hashpower costs you just 1 BTC. You pay 1251 BTC upfront, but you get 1250 BTC back.
This is only true if you mine blocks as usual. If you do double-spending, you get less rewards, so it will cost you more. (Unless you are able to rent more than 50%, then it's free.)
If you mind oversized blocks, you will lose something on rewards. E.g. instead of 1250 BTC you will get only 1200 BTC. So that will cost you 51 BTC in the end.


I'm more conerned about AntPool driving smaller pools out.

OK so now we have a system where users pay fees to miners proportional to their use of Bitcoin blockchain. Everybody pays a little bit. If you use Bitcoin more, you pay more. It is a simple, effective, fair, trustless,  working system. Nobody can cheat by paying less.
So let's replace it with a system based on social pressure! It's going to work because most businesses are ethical businesses and will gladly pay these optional donations! Totally makes sense!
If you look at all of the Mike Hearn proposals, it is clear that he's trying to create a Bitcoin banking system, that is, Bitcoin controlled by a group of semi-benevolent institutions.

In my opinion a person who has opinion on Bitcoin technical matters but doesn't even know how ECDSA works deserves no respect. Go learn some basics first, then we can talk.


Which one? I don't see key point. How about you learn stuff become coming up with "points"?


Digital signature is a proof. Merkle tree is a proof. ID is NOT a proof. Please learn how the protocol works.


Such an agreement is established using blockchain, please learn how it works.


OK if you paid for that education you should try to demand your money back. :D :D :D
Let's try again:
1. Transaction is signed. Same for SegWit and non-SegWit. At that point you have a proof that owner(s) of coins want to move them.
2. Transaction is included into a mined block. At this point you get a proof that transaction, including signatures, was included into a block and thus is confirmed. Difference between SegWit and non-SegWit is that SegWit has two Merkle trees but non-SegWit has one.
3. At a later time, new owner can spend coins in a new transaction, where he references ID of an old transaction.
So people invented a story that transaction-ID used on step  is somehow fundamental to Bitcoin security. It is not. It really doesn't matter how we construct IDs as long as they unambiguously refer to transactions.
Or are you referring to the fact that SegWit uses two Merkle trees? How does that matter? It's a tree of hashes in either way, just slightly different shape.


I'm a "technical elite" for a very different reason: I've been studying Bitcoin since 2011, I made several Bitcoin wallets, I wrote several academic papers about cryptocurrencies and coded my own private blockchain.
So I know how this shit really works and have well informed opinion. (Worth noting that in my blockchain I use something similar to segwit.)

Bitcoin Core includes people who have been maintaining Bitcoin in the last 5+ years, that is, before the schism. They are people who are behind major improvements, fixes, performance increases. They implemented best-in-class cryptographic library, and they have people who invented new cryptographic primitives to improve privacy of Bitcoin. And the developer community is really large: normally around a hundred of people who contribute, and, maybe, 20 people who are continuously active.

The point here is that it's possible.
First thing to note is that if you own a majority of hashpower, attack _doesn't cost you anything_. More specifically, if you win, then the attack doesn't cost you anything, as the cost of hashing will be paid for by block rewards.
But value of reward depends on price, and price drop after successful attack is expected, so miner needs to compensate for this. One option is to short-sell the currency you're attacking on the markets. Then you can not only compensate for loss, but actually make money on this. 
Back to your question, a number of possibilities exist:
1. Just for shits and giggles. This possibility shouldn't be dismissed, as it happened in the past: Luke-jr wrecked CoiledCoin and BBQcoin.
2. A miner might own a lot of bitcoins and feel that BCH threatens them, in that case he might finance attack to protect his investment.
3. Bitcoin supporters might pay miner to attack BCH.
4. A miner can try to profit through short-selling coinciding with an attack.
5. A miner can try to profit through double-spending.
6. A mining pool might be hijacked and do something against owners' will.
Worth noting that there's also a risk that BCH chain will be defended by some of the largest pools like AntPool. However, it's not clear defenders can do anything against a covert 51% attack where an attacker will induce, say, 6-deep reorgs by mining them covertly.

Simplified Payment Verification. Bitcoin light wallets (Electrum, Bitcoin Wallet for Android, ...) use it to check that transaction is confirmed without downloading whole blockchain.
It is possible because proof-of-work is concentrated in block headers. Thus it's enough to download block headers (only about 40 MB today) to check PoW.
On the other hand, with Tangle PoW is spread through all transactions, thus you need to download whole Tangle to verify a transaction. That's gigabytes if not terabytes.
So Tangle is a scam. IOTA team is a bunch of cultists preying on people who do not understand the tech.

Some criticism if you don't mind:
1. This is essentially same as BIP38 or BIP39: send mnemonic in mail body, send password separately. No need for files or anything. (Although you can write mnemonic to a file.) And this way it will be compatible with BIP38/BIP39 tools and wallets.
2. Your site doesn't use SSL, thus bitcoins can be easily stolen via MitM.
3. If your web server is hijacked, bitcoins can be stolen. There is no way to protect against it, aside from releasing it as a Chrome app or asking people to download it from github.
4. Email is not encrypted, so potentially anybody can get these files.
5. Security relies on password, which needs to be strong. If password is short, attacker can harvest emails or dropbox files and then bruteforce it. But how do you transmit a strong password? It can't be in the email itself, because then attacker can steal money just using the email contents. And if you have a channel to transmit a strong password, you might as well use it to transmit the mnemonic.
tl; dr: It is the same as BIP38/BIP39, but with a ton of additional security flaws.

Because in Counterparty values are not associated with outputs (coins) they are associated with addresses.
Colored coins protocols make use of Bitcoin transaction graph. Which means that most Bitcoin scripting features are applicable, and so you can use contracts, payment channels, etc. Colored coins are also well-integrated with Bitcoin: you can make atomic transactions involving Bitcoin and colored coins.
That's not true for Counterparty which simply embeds messages into Bitcoin blockchain without using transaction graph. This results in very different set of characteristics: features which require implicit dependencies between transactions become easy to implement (e.g. bets), while Bitcoin integration becomes much more fragile.


While they look similar to users, technical approach is very different.
I think end users will notice the difference once we see more elaborate colored coin software. You can make atomic transaction involving different assets and bitcoins in matter of seconds, so transaction feel snappy.
But Counterparty trades go through "decentralized exchange" which is based on Bitcoin blocks, trades simply do not make sense outside of blocks. So it operates on ~10 minute time scale, not seconds.

Before a scientific paper is published, it is reviewed by peers, that is, other scientists working in the same field. There is a huge number of specializations within computer science, and most likely a random computer science professor won't be able to make a good review.
If you'll make a paper based on BIP100, a right place to sent it to would be NetEcon (Workshop on the Economics of Networks, Systems and Computation) (this is just one I know about, there might be more). You can find a list of their topic of interest [here]( some examples:
 * Design of incentive-aware network architectures and protocols
 * Game-theoretic models and techniques for network economics
 * Pricing of resources in communication networks, grids, and cloud computing
 * Auctions with applications to networks: spectrum auctions, auction-based marketplaces for network and cloud resources

TM which affected MtGox was like that, but it's trivial to protect against that on wallet level. So it doesn't even need to be solved.
TM which affects contracts is also vulnerable to signers mutating their own signatures.


As I mentioned, it's not practically useful, but let's consider it anyway.
So you propose the following:
1. Alice signs txid-for-signing and appends that to tx.
2. She then hashes whole tx, signs the hash and appends it to tx. So you now have tx-signed-twice
3. tx-signed-twice is then spread on peer network.
So you propose this additional overhead, new messages and so on... instead of just using txid-for-signing to refer to transaction? How does that make sense?

LOL dude, you're missing the point completely.
The point of cryptocurrencies isn't to make investors happy. The point is to create **incorruptible** ledger which allows people to transact **securely**.
This is why they are called CRYPTOcurrencies. Modern cryptography isn't about "hoping for the best", it is about algorithms which are IMPOSSIBLE to break computationally. E.g. it's impossible to forge a cryptographic signature using modern technology.
Investors are interested in cryptocurrencies only because they are useful, and they are useful only because they are secure.
A cryptocurrency which is not secure is not useful.
What you said is so fucking hilarious, I do not even... Would you say that cryptography researchers have "negative feelings" when they publish papers on how to break cyphers/protocols/signature schemes? No, cretin, they are just doing their job. They are describing how to break things so _your_ digital communications remains secure.
The only way to have secure protocols is to eliminate all non-secure ones. This is how it works. No way around it.
Positive feelings won't help you against an attacker. He won't care about community and feelings if he sees profits.
So the only way to have a secure network is to eliminate all non-secure ones.
Let's put aside feelings and talk about security in a serious way. It was known for a long time that two cryptocurrencies cannot share same PoW and remain secure against 51% attack.
So it's us or them. IIRC this was already widely known in 2011-2012 and has nothing to do with modern cryptocurrency politics.

"Ton" is an understatement. If we want to replace the existing banking system with a trustless system Bitcoin/LN, then LN nodes need to own 10-100x more capital than banks.

LN might be good for micropayments, but otherwise we should research systems which do not require nodes to need significant amounts of capital.

No. I mean as big as possible, but accepted by, say, 90% of miners. You said you're a programmer, so here's a algorithm for you:
1. Start with 1 MB block, check if it was accepted.
2. Next time mine a 2 MB block, check.
3. Continue increasing block size.
4. At some point you will get to a point where 50% of your blocks are orphaned, stop increasing block size.
This way you accomplish a number of things:
1. fill hard drives
2. fill UTXO sets (which are kept cached in memory) if you create new UTXO
3. significantly increase orphan rate for everybody
If there is no protocol limit, but there is a practical limit (which is different for each node), you have a problem. This should be obvious to a programmer. What kind of a programmer are you? Only working with HTML?

It definitely does matter if it is SPV or full node: with SPV you can only validate block headers and your own transaction, but not block contents.

@_date: 2015-07-16 11:37:22


It doesn't matter if there is a single merchant or many merchant. The important part here is that merchant doesn't immediately use the money he receives, he might accumulate money to settle with suppliers or pay salaries at a later date.
So suppose, for example, that merchants might accumulate money for 10 days on average. This means that LN nodes need enough capital to cover trade volume for 10 days. And trade volume is significant.
According to blockchain.info estimation, current daily tx volume is 200k BTC, so if you want to cover 10 days of it, that would be 2M BTC in capital. And the whole point of LN is to accommodate higher trade volume...


Yes, but if your payment network cannot support people/companies accumulating money to pay their bills, say, once per month, I don't see how it makes sense.
Maybe it works fine if users just randomly bounce money among themselves, but in reality these patterns are highly non-uniform. E.g. Alice might receive her salary from the employer in one transaction, and then do 100 transactions over the course of month without receiving more payments. On the other hand, business might receive multiple payments during the month, only making few large payments in the end of it.
I recommend you to try a basic simulation using simplest possible topology, but at least remotely realistic usage patterns.
I'm not a random LN hater, I'm actually considering LN or a tech like that for one of our projects, but my analysis shows that it's not viable due to high amounts of capital required to run it, even if it works like advertised. If you have other numbers, please share.

The idea is to use a network of intermediaries, known as Lightning network. So, for example, Alice won't send money directly to Bob because they don't have a payment channel already set up, but both Alice and Bob might already have a channel with Node.
So Alice will instruct Node to send payment to Bob via Node&lt;-&gt;Bob channel, and will also send a payment to Node via Alice&lt;-&gt;Node channel conditioned on that payment.
This is basically similar to the older concept of [hub-and-spoke payment channels]( but is potentially better because channel are bidirectional.
But I see many adoption problems too, like various risks, requirement for node to have some capital and keep it in hot wallet, etc.

OK let me speak as a long-term subscriber and Bitcoin holder. 
I was concerned about Bitcoin scalability as soon as I've read the Bitcoin paper (it was in 2010), and I've made several scalability proposals, e.g. [I described something similar to sidechains]( back in 2011.
So let me tell you something, these "new flavored trolls" say same things as _technical_ people have been saying for all these years.
We understood that Bitcoin security depends on fees, and that fees need to be significant. That Bitcoin is very inefficient (every node processes every transaction) and there needs to be some kind of novel solution or a layer on top of it to make it scale as a worldwide payment network. People described off-chain payment solutions and payment channels years ago.
So this stuff is not new.
What is "new" is that at some point we had an influx of marketers who started saying that Bitcoin transactions are free and instantaneous, and that we should use Bitcoin for everything (without any regards about scalability and feasibility).
Posts and comments made by pumpers and marketers were upvoted, as people like to engage into wishful thinking and would like to see Bitcoin price to rise. 
So apparently you now see those pumpers and marketeers who helped to pump the 2013 bubble as the true bitcoiners, while people who are reminding that Bitcoin actually has fees are dismissed as "trolls". Way to go, bro, way to go.


The opinions you dismiss as trolling are opinions of people who were writing Bitcoin Core code for all these years, particularly, Pieter Wuille, Matt Corallo, Gregory Maxwell, Peter Todd.
Or do you think that a worldwide payment network was actually built by marketers who were trumpeting false advertisements about "no fees" and "instant transactions", while coders are just code monkeys who barely understand anything?
I don't think you even understand what you're doing here. Your post is probably the most vile thing I've seen here for a while, as you're trying to silence and dismiss all opinions which go against the mainstream wishful thinking.

This way of expression impairs Bitcoin security, today.
There are different ways of expressing it, for example, wallets can add a special tag to transactions they produce (into unused nSequence field so that it doesn't add any extra bytes) to indicate that they do not mind blocks &gt;1 MB. Then you can say that the majority of wallets are voting for that.
Also you can have a vote among miners the same way it is done for soft forks.

The fixed supply means virtual unlimited upside when speculating. 
It's essentially a perfect game for speculators playing against other speculators: they do not need to be worried about dilution or missed profit targets, they only need to care about what other speculators think.
And since it's so good for speculation, it's going to be volatile.
Note that the portion of BTC in circulation can be arbitrarily small. E.g. suppose 95% of BTC are held as an investment (e.g. as savings, reserves, investment funds...) and only 5% is in circulation. The price depends on the part which is in circulation, which is small. Each time somebody buys more BTC to add to his savings, he further reduces the amount in circulation and increases the price.
So the upside is virtually unlimited as more and more bitcoins get from circulation into investments.
Now there's a huge disparity in BTC holdings, i.e. there are people who own a lot of bitcoins. Imagine such a person for sells his stash of bitcoins, for whatever reason (maybe he's dying and wants to go in history as the man who crashed Bitcoin, who knows). His holdings might be comparable to the amount of BTC in circulation (since that part can eventually be very small), thus it will crash the price. Other BTC holders might dump it as well realizing this can happen and their holdings will be gone.
So there are these crazy positive feedback loops: after a long uptrend, you can have a big crash.
These things happened in 2011, 2013 and 2017. Even though the price have increased 10000x the magnitude is kinda similar -- you have fluctuations on scale of 10x. So it doesn't look they depend on price.
But people like you keep saying that the next time it will be different... while predicting the next large rally up... and conveniently forgetting about possibility of it coming down.
On the other hand, as I mentioned nobody expects unlimited upside from USD as it can (and will) be diluted, so speculation is much more tame.

I'm not convinced that a trustless scalable systems are impossible.
People say that a global consensus doesn't scale, but it's not necessarily required for payments. E.g. when Alice pays to Bob, she only needs to convince Bob that the payment was valid, not everybody.
It might be possible to partition a big system into N smaller ones, thus reducing a load on each node N-fold. Securing that partitioned system can be a problem, but its not proven that it's impossible.

Lightning network nodes have to serve as a buffer in transactions. E.g. suppose Alice sends 1 bitcoin to Bob using LN, and Bob doesn't spend it immediately, but waits for many days. This means that 2 bitcoins are now locked: one in transaction from Alice to LN node, and another in a transaction from LN node to Bob. This extra bitcoin comes from LN node's capital.
Thus if users do not transact immediately, a lot of these extra bitcoins are needed.
I'm not saying that there aren't enough bitcoins, I'm saying LN nodes will need at lot of them.
If we assume simplest single hop topology, the maximum amount of bitcoins needed is same as held by users, e.g. if users hold 10M bitcoins, LN nodes also need 10M bitcoins.
You seem to assume that a typical case will be much smaller than a theoretical maximum, e.g. it will be possible to server users having 10M bitcoins with only 10k bitcoins owned by LN nodes.
But have you actually done any math which backs this assumption? What makes you think that a tiny fraction of all bitcoins will be enough to facilitate large trade volumes?

So breakeven `s` is affected by `Y`. If `s &gt; 0.5` it stops making sense, as at that point miner can boost his profit by totally controlling Bitcoin blockchain.

Particularly, you're saying that "Subsatoshi" is the reference open source implementation. So I go to Subsatoshi web site, and from that into their github: 
And there is no code. Only README, LICENSE and two yml files. With content like this:
    split:
      - authors:
        shares: 50
        split:

This is not code. Where is code?
Are you just a guy who likes to talk?
And from what I see ABIS and "Value Chain Distribution Protocol" are also a bunch of readmes with no concrete content.

Making Bitcoin scalable requires research rather than development. We need some sort of a clever algorithm which will let us to go from `O(M * N)` to `O(M * log N)`, so to speak, to make it all asymptotically more optimal. You can't there through incremental optimizations.
There is a plenty of people working on various ideas in this space, both people working on a formal academic research and hobbyists. For example, there is a [GHOST protocol]( proposal. Work on succinct proofs also seems relevant.
But this has nothing to do with Bitcoin Core. We don't want to wait until somebody has an awesome idea, we want to use Bitcoin now. And Bitcoin Core team keeps it working and secure.
So yes, different people work on different things. It is not bad.

But this would make no difference because blocks are close to 1 MB anyway. There is a big difference between flooding with 1 MB blocks and flooding with 1 GB blocks.


That's not required, 1 GB per day is enough to make it at least mildly annoying. So 1% of hashpower is more than enough


I don't think you understand how Bitcoin works... Miners can mine blocks anonymously, and they are then spread by nodes. A flooding miner can submit his block to any node, and unless we have a network-wide limit, it will be propagated on the network.
And existence of a network-wide is exactly what we're discussing.
Block size limit can't be a local policy as it will lead to forking. E.g. suppose we have no hard limit and it is just a configuration option. So some nodes set it to 50 MB while other set it to 100 MB. So somebody mines 75 MB block. Now 100 MB miners will accept it and will mine their chain on top of it, while 50 MB miners will reject it, and will continue their chain without it.
So if 50 MB miners are in minority, Bitcoin network will split into two.
Which is exactly what we'd like to avoid at all costs.
So again, block size cannot be a local policy. Bitcoin can work only if the same policy is enacted by all the nodes. So if you remove the limit, nodes will have to accept block of any size.
And they cannot punish the abusing miner, because on the protocol level miners and nodes are anonymous. There is just no notion of identity.

Debatable. Gold price never got stable. BTC is likely to be much more volatile as the total number is fixed.


A basket of commodities &amp; products can be pretty objective in this sense.


USD loses value at a rate about 0.3% per month. BTC can drop 3% in matter of hours.
It could be that USD is so stable _because_ it loses value: no sane person would buy USD hoping that it will increase in value significantly, so speculative demand is very low. On the other hand, BTC is all about speculative demand -- due to a limited supply, it _can_ quickly rise in value.

One thing is that they know for sure that all full nodes will reject blocks built on top of invalid ones, so they have an incentive to validate blocks ASAP.
That's not a certainty with a fraud proof model, unless probability of fraud proof propagating to all nodes before mined coins become mature is almost 1. Basically, if there is a chance that an exchange will accept fresh coins mined on top of a fraudulent block, there might be an incentive to keep mining.
Another difference is that now it takes about 10 seconds to validate a block, so it's unlikely that many blocks will be mined on top of an invalid one. Thus even if miner won't reject his own block, there won't be much damage as others will just orphan it.
But fraud proofs might take longer time to propagate/validate, so there is a possibility that many blocks will be mined on top of it.


If you assume that the majority of miners will get a fraud proof in a timely fashion then this extra step is not necessary. But can we just assume that?
Effect of a network split on a Bitcoin network is well-understood: basically if several miners which represent a tiny fraction of all network are separated from the rest, it barely makes any difference.
But if we do sharding, if attacker manages to isolate nodes which could create and distribute fraud proofs, he will trick the majority of mining power to work on the fraudulent chain, and thus trick SPV clients into accepting his payments if fraud proofs are delayed for a significant time.
That's not to say we need an extra step for sure, but there are more potential attacks in this model, and they need to be addressed.

Propagation time is measured in bytes per second. 4 MB per 10 minutes is same as 1 MB per 2.5 minutes -- 6666 bytes per second.
There is also some fixed per-message latency, but it is on order of seconds, not minutes. So there is hardly any difference between 2.5m and 10m interblock intervals.
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:03:48

Well it depends, immediately after a block it was 1000-1500 transactions (people hoping to send without a fee etc). It could grow to 5000 if there was no block for a long time.

I think they were trying to reduce UTXO set size by spending spammer's outputs. Each transaction needs at least one output, so they could send it to zero-value provably unspendable output.
But the output they are creating is not provably unspendable, in fact it can be spent by anyone, so it can't be pruned. So yeah, good job Discus Fish...

Miners could do what? The amount of junk they include is limited to 1 MB per block, which isn't much. Everybody can cope with it.

If cartel has a majority of hashpower it will be able to impose its policy on non-cartel members. Essentially, a cartel can enforce a soft-fork which specifies minimal fees.

A compact fraud proofs are impossible, I think. You might devise a challenge-response protocol where miners will have to justify inclusion of certain transaction into a block by proving its dependencies exist.
But there is a lot of problematic aspects here, like what happens after fraud is proven? Are miners incentivized to reject fraud blocks? Is it possible that miners get into disagreement?
You need a consensus about fraud, so fraud proofs themselves need to get into a blockchain.
I think that maybe with different block graph topologies such as treechains fraud proofs won't be necessary or will become simpler.

@_date: 2015-07-17 16:08:21
No, it's not completely safe. There is a number of attack vectors.
People designing LN believe that it's possible to tune parameters in such a way that it will be safe.  Particularly, the attack you've described seems unlikely because it's enough to have a single miner who will accept Johnny's transaction into a block.
But I think there is always a risk due to unpredictable external factors. Like tx flood we recently had, many transactions were not confirmed for days, so if system depends on timing it might be vulnerable.

This isn't true. Suppose that there is a miner (or a group of miners/pools) who has 25% of total hashpower and who mines 8 MB blocks. While 75% of miners do not accept blocks larger than 1 MB.
Then if you run a node which accepts 8 MB blocks, accepting payments with 1 confirmation will be much less secure, because statistically 1 out of 4 blocks which are at top of your longest chain will be orphaned. This can be used for double-spending. If attacker can make sure that his transaction only get into 8 MB blocks (which isn't hard), he will get 100% successful 1-confirmation double-spend once each 40 minutes.
So you need to wait more confirmations... Probability of 2-confirmation payment being orphaned is 6.25% and probability of 3-confirmation payment orphaning is 1.5%. Note that it doesn't mean probability of an attack is 1.5%, an attack can be 100% successful, this number only affects how much time attacker needs to wait.
BTC-E accepts funds after 3 confirmations, so this attack could be used against BTC-E if they were using node configured to accept 8 MB blocks. If attacker is the same person who mines 8 MB blocks, it will cost him 900 BTC to run miners for a day, so it makes sense as long as double-spend profit is higher than 900 BTC.

I do not like the way you formulated the question.
Fees are certainly not nice. But they are decided by the market. We cannot "make" them come down by a decree.
And the market clearly says that decentralized, incorruptible ledger is  feature. The market doesn't seem to care about high fees.
Now what we can do is to find technical solutions which will reduce fees or make them irrelevant. 
In fact this could be done years ago, as payment channel technology is fairly simple. So e.g. Coinbase and BitPay could implement it, so payments from Coinbase wallet to BitPay merchant can be sent without putting any burden on the blockchain.
But it seems Bitcoin companies have very little interest in Bitcoin tech. They figured out how to use the most basic transactions and do not want to put more effort into tech, let alone cooperate with each other.
Brian Armstrong of Coinbase has tremendous power. If Coinbase adopts some layer 2 protocol, other companies would follow. So he could solve this issue essentially single-handedly. But instead of doing that, this wanker trolls developers and embraces alt-coins (which do not solve the problem but kick the can).
Same thing about Blockchain.Info. They have a metric fuckton of money, they could create amazing tech. When was the last time you've heard about innovation coming out of Blockchain.Info? Nic Carry travels around the world and tells people how awesome it is that they have a million wallets. Amazing, indeed. What's about path forward? Just increase the block size?
Now other companies are developing the tech (LN). Hopefully big wallet companies will at least have guts to deploy it.
@_date: 2015-07-17 12:17:07
Interesting, so you have a way to describe how much each one should get, but how do you do the actual payouts?
I've heard about an idea of stochastic micropayments: if money is sent to one recipient at time, selected randomly according to desired distribution, eventually over a large number of payments the actual distributed amounts will converge to the desired distribution.
@_date: 2015-07-15 21:34:27
Also elephant in the room is immense capital required to run it. 
Lightning network nodes will need to hold at least as much money as users who are willing to transact. E.g. suppose Alice uses lightning network to buy groceries, buying $100 per day, for a month. In the end she will send $3000. If we do not want these transactions to appear on the blockchain (which is the whole point), lightning node will need $3000 to be locked in a channel with the merchant.
Now multiply it by the number of users... For 1 million users (which is not much: it is a population of a single city) you need $3 billion in capital. It makes no effing sense.
On a global scale, with 1 billion users who want to keep up to $1000 locked, lightning nodes will have to own $1 trillion worth of bitcoins... And all that money needs to be kept in hot wallets, essentially. Absolutely ridiculous.
@_date: 2015-07-07 07:41:53
1. I don't think it will be a sustained attack. It makes more sense to do an intensive attack for several days or weeks than to do a lackluster attack for several months or years: the second will cost more, but won't accomplish much.
2. Anti-spam solution is quite easy to implement, and we basically already have it. Even if attacker is willing to burn his bitcoins, coin-days is a scarce resource. There is already a notion of transaction priority in Bitcoin Core, it is based on coin-days. So as an anti-spam measure, we can simply throttle transactions with low priority, that is, establish a priority cut-off.
It is not a perfect protection, but it makes attack harder: attacker will need more capital (in addition to bitcoins being burned) and prepare in advance.

I didn't say that, and it doesn't follow.
On contrary, crushing a coin is possible only once hashrate drops sufficiently, and it's not a trivial thing. A miner needs to be motivated and he needs to take a risk.


Well, because it didn't? It might take a while. Months, years... Until somebody has enough motivation to do it.
Vulnerabilities are not exploited as soon as they exist.
E.g. on Ethereum chain, Parity multi-sig wallet was vulnerable for many months before it was exploited. And it was in open sight.
Somebody with your kind of "logic" might have said: "Look, nobody was able to steal money for 1 month, thus it might be safe!"


OK, let's put it straight: BCH is attacking Bitcoin. There's a lot of evidence for that:

Yeah, I know. What you propose is doing eye surgery through the ass.


You need to learn how ECDSA works. It allows one to produce many valid signatures for a fixed key and message.


We can also do eye surgery through the ass. But why not just make transaction identifier to identify payment? Does it make too much sense?


The opposition to SW is mostly because of stupidity. Changes are inevitable if you want a fix.


Yes, it's mostly because of politics.


Any protocol modification introduces "technical debt", as you need to support both old and new versions. (It's not really technical debt, just some extra complexity.)


Merkle root commits to all parts of transaction, so once transaction enters a block it's guaranteed to remain intact. TxID is how you refer to transaction from another transaction, or how your wallet identifies transaction. It has NOTHING to do with intactness.
People who claim that SW is bad for technical reasons do not understand the tech and their opinion is irrelevant.

Bitcoin is a system where every node needs to verify every transaction, and this transaction needs to be stored forever.
Imagine if BitTorrent worked the same way, that is, every packet will need to pass through every node. In that case a million of users downloading in parallel will get only a single byte per second, and downloading a movie would take hundreds of years.
So Bitcoin is very different from BitTorrent, the fact that both start with Bit and are peer-to-peer. BitTorrent is very scalable, while Bitcoin is very un-scalable.
So what makes you think that Bitcoin is suitable for microtransactions? It never was.
Yes, previously we  could do microtransactions because Bitcoin was barely used and there was a lot of spare capacity. Basically, Bitcoin was just a toy.
Now it isn't. Now it is actually in use, and there is not much spare capacity, so you can no longer play with it.
If you want to fix this, fix the root problem: every node verifies every transaction. I believe that it is possible, because fundamentally we don't need a 'global consensus' but just an ability of user A to be able to prove to user B that the payment he made is valid, we do not need to inform every node about it.
Trying to solve the actual problem will be much more productive than bitching about censorship.

The idea of Ethereum is that Ethereum full nodes are supposed to perform all computations Ethereum users want to perform and store all the state Ethereum users want to keep.
Think about it. A single computer (node) does _all_ the computations. And keeps _all_ the state. In addition, archival nodes will keep the state of all computations, ever. 
To think it is going to be used on a global scale is borderline insane. Pretty much [this]( literally. All computations on one computer.
On the other hand, Bitcoin optimized for payments. There might be some scalability issues right now, but it is much easier to optimize a highly specialized system than to optimize a general one. 
One simple example is a dust threshold which curbs UTXO set growth. Bitcoin transaction are not arbitrary programs, they transfer bitcoins, and hence nodes can implement various policies, e.g. limit micropayments, discourage UTXO spam etc. (E.g. pay fee for creation of excessive UTXOs.) This way we can reduce the amount of state each node needs to keep, making running nodes accessible.
Ethereum is a nice experiment. It would be interesting to see how it goes.
But it is nowhere near Bitcoin in terms of pragmatic reliability and security.
It would be interesting to see how it pans out. I believe that a likely scenario is that requirement for Ethereum nodes will grow over time, so eventually (say, 5-10 years from now) it will get fewer and fewer nodes, becoming much more centralized.

This is how it looks like when you send money to multiple recipients without using sendmany. Some exchanges use ass-retarded code which can't use sendmany, so it tends to produce long chains.

Cf. overfishing.
If there is a single entity doing all the fishing, it can easily choose to do fishing in a sustainable way, so that long-term profits are maximized.
But if there are many fishing operations, they need to coordinate to prevent overfishing. They need to impose quotas, control fishing, enforce them. Otherwise, if somebody fishes too much, it affects everyone the next year if fish stocks are not replentished.
As you probably know, overfishing is a thing. It's not always possible to impose quotes. Even more so with Bitcoin miners (mining pools) who can choose to be anonymous.
The whole point of mining is security against double-spend attacks. Yes, competition can 'drive down fees to the equilibrium between what people are willing to pay, and what miners are willing to include", but that equilibrium might be too low.
There is a simple formula: a cost of making a block approximately equals average reward per block. This comes from a fact that mining is competitive and difficulty is self-adjusting.
So if fees are driven down to the point where miners collect 1 BTC per block, it would cost one 6 BTC to make 6 blocks to do a 6-confirmation double spend attack. Thus it might be unsafe to accept 10 BTC payment with only 6 confirmations, let alone 100 BTC payment...
It comes down to economic incentives: mining fees will be a tiny fraction of what miners can earn by assisting double-spends, thus  double-spending becomes more economically viable.

Bitcoin works only if there are multiple competing miners.
One person started using GPUs, another person can do that too. One company have developed ASIC chips -- another can do that.
The problem with ASICBOOST is that it's patented, so companies cannot freely use that.
This creates an advantage to companies who have access to this patent, which destroys Bitcoin's decentralization.
Another problem is that it creates pervese incentives, e.g. to mine small blocks.

But do you have a clear description of the idea or something like that?
@_date: 2015-07-25 04:41:31


No. A node with 2 MB limit will reject 3 MB blocks, so it might end up on  a fork when 3 MB blocks are produced (just like 1 MB nodes in your example).


Do you even understand how it works? "The blockchain" cannot just "reach" 1.00001 MB. It all depends on behavior of miners.
If only a minority of miners accepts blocks larger than 1 MB, then the main chain will remain 1 MB, and bigger blocks will be orphaned.
Suppose that some brave miner generates 1.5 MB block, it gets propagated to nodes which accept blocks bigger than 1 MB, yay! Then other miners generate two 1 MB blocks, and they beat that 1.5 MB block, it gets orphaned. So you won't get anywhere until you get a consensus among miners.
The "decision" should be a specific limit (or lack of limit), not just "higher than 1 MB". Otherwise there is an elevated risk of forking/double-spending.

First of all, scaling debate existed for as long as Bitcoin existed. Bitcoin is designed in such a way that every node processes every transaction. This doesn't scale.
When I read the Bitcoin paper in 2010, I understood that it's going to be the biggest problem, as your average computer cannot handle transactions from users all over the world.
Satoshi was asked the same question when he announced Bitcoin, and he said that it's theoretically possible to achieve VISA-level scaling if "Moore's law" continues.
The problem is that Satoshi (and, later, Mike Hearn) didn't analyse the incentive structure. Mike Hearn later mentioned that he assumes miners to be benevolent and doesn't think that game theory applies. This is essentially the core of scaling debate: do we need to analyze incentives or do we just assume that miners benevolent?
Block size limit became a contentious topic somewhere around 2013, as is evident from Peter Todd's [Keep Bitcoin Free]( video.


Well, if we need segwit SF anyway, why not get 2 MB block size increase this way?
The fact that it is considered "highly contentious" is an evidence of ulterior motives.


People who were "all about adoption" didn't understand technical difficulties and dangers. They were pushing Bitcoin for use in point-of-sale situations, while it's clearly not designed to handle them.
Now people realize that maybe it's not so simple and we cannot really make a global payment system using just Satoshi's simple design.
Yes, "vicious civil war" is very bad, but accepting dangerous changes is worse.
If Bitcoin block size limit stays at 1 MB, Bitcoin is not pointless: using Bitcoin on-chain transactions for everyday transactions becomes too expensive, but you can still use it to keep money outside of control of governments (which is something which makes much more sense than buying coffee on-chain).
If Bitcoin becomes centralized and corruptible, it becomes completely pointless and worthless.
So I'd rather err on conservative side. I don't want adoption at all costs. And number of toxic posts on reddit does not bother me too much.

Yes, which they can trivially make.


No, but you are.


Well again, what is the purpose of block size limit?
If miners were all running rationally, we won't need it. And, indeed, initially Bitcoin had no limit.
But then Satoshi thought: What if miners intentionally start making huge blocks stuffed with send-to-self transactions? They could quickly fill users' drives with meaningless data.
This is a possible attack vector. So Satoshi added a block size limit. It protects users and miners from potential attacks from other miners.


They can create 4 MB blocks but they don't. Just because attack doesn't happen now does not mean it's impossible and we shouldn't protect from it.
4 MB blocks can't do much damage, 8 MB ones will be twice as painful.

Miners can require arbitrarily low fees, even no fees at all. So suppose that somehow there is a miner or mining pool which is a buddy with an attacker, they can start filling everybody else's hard drives with junk. So yes, it can happen.

If you want to talk about formal qualifications, there is a bunch of academic papers on Bitcoin accepted into peer-reviewed scientific journals (that is, those papers were reviewed by widely acknowledged experts), and they touched economic/game theoretic aspects of Bitcoin, among other things.
Particularly, the paper I co-authored got accepted into _The joint Workshop on Pricing and Incentives in Networks and Systems_. So I guess this makes me formally qualified on the topic of Bitcoin block size, as the debate is mostly about "pricing and incentives in networks and systems".
I don't have a strong opinion about the optimal block size at this point (it requires careful analysis, a lot of work), but I'd like to comment on the debate itself.
First of all, I think you shouldn't be so dismissive about core developer qualification. Yes, they aren't economists (no shit). But I'm quite certain that they know math. Game theory is a branch of math (and so is computer science, by the way). Microeconomics essentially boils down to math once you strip all the terminology.
My observation is that most of them use sound reasoning. That is, if I was reviewing an academic paper which contained their reasoning/arguments, I'd accept it.


Now it is a good point. So why won't Gavin make a proposal in a format of an academic paper, and get some 'qualified economists' to review it? He had several years to do that.
Other core developers (Blockstream people, that is) are NOT proposing changes, they are only warning that changes can be detrimental.


No, they don't. Have you heard about things like tragedy of commons, race to bottom, prisoners' dilemma? These are well-known concepts in economics/game theory, which demonstrate that a group of people might end up with outcome which is the worst for all of them.
It would be cool if people stop writing shitty blog and reddit posts and will instead spend time to make a proper analysis instead.

You can also use ~10 bits of timestamp, which gives you 2^42 space.

If we were designing a new cryptocurrency from scratch instead of trying to patch Bitcoin we could make this much more efficient, no? Namely, introduce payment channels/contestation as a first class concept.
Consider this: 
1. Alice wants to establish a new payment channel for her daily purchases, she needs to assemble a list of parties she frequently interacts with. Those can be both merchants and intermediaries which serve multiple merchants.
2. She sends her coins to an output which requires N signatures (her and N-1 entities she wishes to interact with), also it is specially marked as a payment channel, and thus has enforced contestation period:
3. A transaction spending this output must have a sequence number (which is incremented with each update) and it is contestable: If a transaction spending this output which has higher sequence number is published before the timeout, it replaces the transaction with lower number (and bumps the timeout).
4. Now we have a N-party payment channel where a payment between any two of the parties can be done: sending party will propose a new transaction version which decreases his balance while receiving receiving party's balance, and it will be signed by everybody including the sender, thus indicating his consent. 
5. New transaction gets higher sequence number and thus will trump the older one. If older one s published, the offended party who has more money in a new one will publish the new one. Extra fee might be attached to replacement transaction to encourage miners.
6. A problem with availability (all N parties need to be present) can be solved by making normal (non-payment-channel) transactions spending payment-channel-outputs which can be used temporarily until all N parties are able to sign a new version, invalidating those dependent transaction. (E.g. Alice will first pay Wal-Mart using a new transaction going out of her output, and later a update transaction will incorporate this change.)
The advantage over Lightning is that it doesn't need intermediaries for normal functions.


If you don't need to move coins between partitions, you don't need a global order, it's enough to establish order within one partition.

I think it would be simpler to make 4096 variants of a single transaction with coins which belong to you. Then you can just append it to an existing block and you don't need any complex tx-shuffling logic.
E.g. 
1. You make a block with total size less than 999735 bytes.
2. Take a coin you own, generate 4096 different addresses and make 4096 transactions which spend that coin, with a fee same or less as the last transaction in the block.
3. Do the merkle stuff with that transaction appended to the block.

@_date: 2015-07-26 20:32:21
The core issue is that each miner verifies each transaction.
Suppose we would split the work so each node (or miner) verifies only a fraction of all transactions. E.g. suppose we use the first digit of txid to decide which group of miner is going to verify it.
The problem with it is transaction 8177d7840ae28846e3d4fee314d17f8c74ef953bebf2d0cede2681613477d6a6 might depend on transaction 6aefb3190cc2d251dfff8c637f891949c5d2f33ecbe24ab9d281d922d506c614 which belongs to a different group. Thus either miners need to trust each other, or we go back to the need of having a full blockchain.
If miners will trust each other, we'll have significantly worse security characteristics, as it will be enough to hijack one group of miners to destroy the whole thing.
Then we could make it so that a transaction in a group A can depend only on transactions in group A. This could work, but now you have problems with fragmentation of mining power, SPV and so on.
So this split is not impossible, in theory, but might be extremely hard or unfeasible.

We discussed CodeValley in some time ago. It looks like these guys have re-invented linking.
In languages like C/C++ when software is being built, compiler first translates source code to so-called object files (which are, basically, pieces of machine code plus meta-information about functions present in them) and then object files are linked together into an executable. Linker basically stitches everything together, corrects the pointers, etc.
Apparently CodeValley people want to monetize this process.
Selling object files or libraries of thereof is quite old and doesn't sound exciting.
So it seems like they invented some sort of a new linking protocol where a vendor will ship a particular piece of binary specifically tied to a particular executable instead of a more general library/object/code file.
So I would guess, from what they say, that they managed to build executable(s) which consists of 500,000 individual functions. Potentially each of this functions can be provided by an individual vendor, so building an executable might require 500,000 contracts.

I don't see why. Suppose that somebody creates a subreddit about foo. 100 users join and discuss foo. These discussions are very interesting and attract 900 users, but those 900 users are interested not only in foo, but also in foobar. So they start discussing foobar as well. But the original moderator says that he originally wanted a subreddit about foo, not foobar, and he bans all discussions about foobar, recommending people to go to other reddit.
Is that a failure? Debatable. Why should the moderator and the original users should give up their place if some people who joined afterwards should discuss something else?
The way reddit works, moderators have more power than regular users. This is similar to nodes and miners in Bitcoin network: number of nodes is irrelevant for consensus.
But people can revolt against moderator by going to a different subreddit.

It's not so massive. 2^24 addresses is 335 MB of data. That easily fits into GPU's memory, for example. Do you think it would be a problem for GPU to do 16M hashes reading 335 MB of data in order to find collisions? Something tells me a decent GPU can do that in less than a second.


I think you've got it wrong. The goal of Greg's SF proposal is to disable a specific ASICBOOST optimization which is incompatible with SW.
Specifically, we are talking about covert ASICBOOST on a full block. The optimization allows going from 2^28 operations to 2^24, and Greg's SF brings it back to 2^28.
It has no effect on empty-block covert ASICBOOST, and has reduced effect on small-block covert ASICBOOST.
I don't see extraNonce mentioned anywhere, miners are free to grind it.


Grinding isn't done on ASIC, it might be done on the pool side or on a local machine which talks with ASICs. So changing grinding strategy doesn't require new mining chips.

Historic parts of the blockchain can be kept in a distributed hash table. Every node can contribute a little.
Downloading the blockchain can become a problem for new nodes. In that case a committed UTXO tree + replay of last N blocks can be an acceptable solution.
In theory, it weakens the Bitcoin security model, as an attacker who do a N-block reorg can effectively 'rewrite' the whole UTXO set rather than just N blocks.
In practice, it's not a problem at all, as there is no practical difference between reorg'ing last 50000 blocks and rewriting the entire UTXO set: in either case Bitcoin security model is completely broken. Let's consider two cases:

It was always a store of value. As a currency, it sucks big way.
For a currency, it makes sense to use something to have a stable value, i.e. pegged to dollar or a basket of commodities.
But one of Bitcoin's features is finite supply. This isn't something you want in a currency.
FYI it's actually trivial to make auto-pegged currency: fixed difficulty. In that case price will be pegged to electricity cost. But this is not something investors want.

Soft fork/hard fork refer to a kind of rule change. Soft fork cannot be a hard fork by definition.
The situation where there are two active chains is called chain split. Soft fork CAN lead to a chain split. So can hard fork.
Miner-activated soft fork are less likely to lead to a dangerous chain split, that's why they are preferred.
UASFs happened many time in the past, they are not unprecedented. Satoshi's fixes were UASFs. 1 MB block size limit was UASF. P2SH was UASF.
Many alt-coins had UAHFs, basically dev makes a new version and tells users &amp; miners that they need to upgrade. They are in fact quite common.
What's different about BIP148 is that it's contentious, and thus chain split is quite likely.
As for BIP148 being "too easily gamed", well, it's not supposed to be activated after 90% of nodes support it, no. We need support from exchanges and payment processors like BitPay.
Sadly they avoid making this decision.
Users who support BIP148 shouldn't just run a BIP148 node, they should ask Bitcoin companies they are doing business with to support BIP148, threatening to move their business elsewhere.
That cannot be "easily gamed". If BitPay's customer asks them to support BIP148, they can confirm that that customer has non-negligible value, so Sybil attack is impossible.

Historically, "1 KB = 1024 bytes" convention was used for memory sizes because it is convenient to make memory sizes power-of-two and kilo- SI prefix is close to 2^10.
On the other hand, telecom/networking people always used SI prefixes properly, for example, one megabit/s is 1 million bits per second. Power of two has no special significance in networking.
Now crazy people who learned that a "gigabyte" of memory in their computer is `1024 * 1024 * 1024` bytes also demand that their gigabit network card should be able to push 2^30 bits per second or some other nonsense like that. Well, fuck you, this just isn't how it works, educate yourself. For everything except memory size we still use International System of Units, not some arbitrary convention.

Well, it's hard to quantify cases where it's useful/useless since we don't have all cases actively used yet, so it's subjective.
You can certainly argue that the only purpose of Bitcoin blockchain is anti-double-spend oracle. 
But _in practice_ it is used for other things like: notification about incoming payments and storing history. In practice, these things are very useful, and I'd argue that without them Bitcoin will probably go nowhere.
E.g. the original Bitcoin payment protocol which used IP addresses was incredibly inconvenient for consumers who are mostly behind NATs. If Bitcoin required you to have an addressable IP address, it would be a non-starter. If Bitcoin required you to run a server, it would be a non-starter. If Bitcoin required you to use a third-party server, it would be very icky.
Is it expensive to use blockchain for notifications and history storage? Yes. But it's up to consumers to decide whether it's _too_ expensive.
Consumers want highly-available and censorship-resistant service for notifications &amp; history. And they don't want it be controlled by a particular company which can simply go down with all the data.
Is it possible to build a separate decentralized network just for that? Maybe, but so far nobody did that, AFAIK. And it will be more-or-less like Bitcoin network anyway, I think. So why not just use the blockchain?
Of course, payment notification &amp; history is just one example of data people want to be synchronized &amp; persistent. There are many more examples. Like trading (asset exchange) history, for example, people might want to preserve their trade history for posterity, and if they don't mind paying publication fee, why not?
In any case, I don't think it's a good idea to remove this stuff just because you can. Maybe it's better to decouple it and make it so that people who don't want to pay for storage don't have to.
In Ethereum, storage is optional. You can develop payment channel/state channel/Lightning on top of Ethereum very easily, since it can do general purpose computation. (For that matter, you can easily implement the whole Bitcoin protocol _within_ an Ethereum contract.) You can design a protocol in such a way that data is posted on blockchain only in case of a conflict.
But you can also put data/state on the blockchain. If people want to pay for it, why not?
I think development effort difference between stateful and stateless applications is at least _several orders of magnitude_, so that's also a factor.
You seem to be oblivious of realities of software development. Yes, _in theory_ we can use NIZKPs + separate storage solution to develop a very efficient protocol. But building that will require several years of an expert developers. As opposed for few days of Ethereum developers. (From personal experience: the stuff I was thinking through how to approach for years I could do on Ethereum as an exercise over weekend.)
Don't you think there is some value in time-to-market? Prototypes? Did you read worse-is-better articles by RPG?
Not everything needs to be "right stuff" and top efficient.
it might be as well _cheaper_ to pay for storage or whatever than to hire a top expert team to design you a highly optimized protocol.
So I think shitting on Ethereum is kinda silly. Yes, they have different priorities, that doesn't mean they don't know what they're doing.
It's same as claiming that GUI isn't useful and companies who do GUIs scam people. Yes, in theory, you can do everything using command line/terminal interface. But in practice GUIs are useful when you consider human psychology, and now billions of people use GUIs.
So Ethereum is like GUI, I think: _theoretically_, you don't need all that stuff, but in practice, it is useful -- and quite likely, will be successful.

Bitcoin can't work like that for technical reasons. If billions of people are solo-mining, we'll need to record billions of transactions per day just to record their mining contributions. Which means:
 * bandwidth and storage requirements for nodes will be huge, so we won't have billions of nodes; very few people have powerful computing clusters in their home; or they have to join pools, so we're back to square one
 * thin clients will need to download terabytes of data to verify transactions... thus we won't have thin nodes
It would be _nice_ to make Bitcoin strictly peer-to-peer, but it's just not technically possible at this point.
If you're OK with mining pools but want hashpower to be decentralized, you could design a hash function which favors CPU or GPU mining (that is, advantages of specialized ASIC hardware won't be so pronounced).
CPU mining is rather problematic because a lot of CPUs are controlled by criminals (botnets). So this way you'll make botnets profitable, that's not good.
GPU mining is less problematic, but advantages over ASIC mining aren't quite clear. It will let some gamers to use their existing GPUs. But when Bitcoin was GPU-mined, we still had commerical operations. And now there's a plenty of GPU-mined alt-coins, it doesn't look like they are more decentralized than Bitcoin.
There are also arguments in favor of ASIC mining: Bitcoin miners buy hardware which is only good for mining Bitcoin, thus they have a vested interest. They can't just abandon Bitcoin and switch to mining something else.

Transaction replacement isn't required for double-spending. Mempools aren't synchronized, so if Alice sends transaction A1 and A2 which spend the same  coin to different nodes, their mempools will disagree. Which of them gets confirmed depends whether the miner who miners the next block got A1 or A2 first.
Has nothing to do with replacement, really.

"Mempool backlog" is not a problem _per se_:
 * users do not care, all that care about is whether _their_ transactions are confirmed, and that depends on the prioritization
 * most nodes do not care as long as fits into RAM (and currently it does)
Blockchain size, on the other hand, matters, because that data needs to be kept _forever_, also all nodes have to keep UTXO set, so a permanent increase in UTXO set size is a problem.
So back to paying higher fees, it also forces spammers to pay higher fees to stay relevant. But I'd like to see more intelligent prioritization algorithm which takes into account coin-days-destroyed and number of outputs.

Increasing block size limit increases centralization pressure and thus makes Bitcoin more corruptible. If we keep increasing block size we'll get to a point when only handful of large miners (pools) exist and control all mining, and most people can't afford running a node.
Do you agree with that?
That said, 2-4 MB blocks are probably safe. Maybe 8 MB.
The problem with 2 MB HF isn't a technical problem, the problem is that people pushing that HF have ulterior motive -- they reject a technically superior alternative of a 2 MB SF. This smells of corruption, so I cannot agree with that.


If a billion people does a transaction a day every node needs to process a billion transactions per day. This cannot be done on consumer-grade hardware.
A person who runs a full node on a laptop for privacy and security reasons won't be able to do so. Bitcoin will no longer be peer-to-peer cash.
But there are other alternatives, such as payment channels, lightning network and off-chain transactions. They can support everyday transactions at scale.
So why are you pushing a solution which sacrifices privacy and security? Again, I smell ulterior motives/corruption.

1. You don't need to buy **all** mining capacity, ~51% is enough.
2. Yes, currently Bitcoin security is protected by the fact that hashpower needed to conduct an attack can't be rented, perhaps because miners are interested to protect their investment into ASIC mining equipment.
But mining is likely to become much less lucrative over time, if miners get only a tiny profit here and there they will be more open to opportunity to rent their equipment out.

You need to look at bigger picture.
Does Bitcoin even make sense? Is it going to survive in the long term, or is it just a fad?
Gavin Andresen, once Bitcoin lead developer and chief scientist, openly says that he doesn't know what will secure Bitcoin in the long term. Isn't that worrisome?
Does it make sense to put your savings into Bitcoin if nobody knows whether it's going to survive next 10 years?
It would be nice to have at least a baseline model of Bitcoin security model. And 'fee market' can be such a baseline model. Thus it is good to have 'fee market' as it helps Bitcoin to make sense in the long term.
Note that nobody is talking about 10x fee hike. It's not about rising fees. It is about seeing incentives at work: users have an incentive to add a fee to their transaction to get it confirmed, and miners have an incentive to add transactions to blocks to collect those fees.
Systems with meaningful incentives are generally more stable than systems built on 'altruism' and whatnot. 
Getting millions of people to use Bitcoin shouldn't be a goal by itself. Those millions of people might switch to something different if they discover some flaw, or if they just get bored by it. Because, frankly, most people have no reasons to use Bitcoin instead of credit cards, for example.
We should focus on building a stable and sustainable system which actually makes sense, is based on a sound security model etc. Adoption will come.

Pooled mining _is_ hash renting. The pool makes blocks using hashing provided by "miners", who are compensated for their work, but do not receive block reward for the block they found. So pools rent hashing to make blocks, and pay for this rent in bitcoins.
Other forms of hash renting (like NiceHash, for example) aren't so popular because normal pooling works quite well for most people, and there isn't significant demand to pay for above what pools pay.


I have anecdotal evidence that miners don't really give a fuck about what they mine, they do it for profit.
People who actually want bitcoins go and buy them.
Actually there's solid evidence that miners are some stupid fucks: back when GHASH.io had &gt;50% of total hashpower we had posts all over reddit urging miners to switch to other pools, and yet they remained with GHASH.io for quite some time. I remember one of such miners came here to explain that he prefers GHASH because it gives him slightly bigger and more consistent payouts, and that's all he cares.
Same thing with BitMain-affiliated pools -- few years ago they had majority of hashpower. If miners really cared about BTC this won't have happened.

Usually when you start progress is much faster because there are few transactions in DB and contents can be cached in memory. Thus it will essentially only write data without a need to read it back, and writes can be buffered.
On the other hand when DB size exceeds cache, you will be paused due to a need to read data from a slow disk before you can proceed with verification.
There will be a sharp slowdown. But that doesn't mean it's exponential.

The important part is that old versions of these signed transactions can be revoked. This is what makes these channels bidirectional.
E.g. suppose Johnny and Sally put 10 BTC each. First Johnny pays Sally 5 BTC using this channel (sending her a signed transaction), but then Sally pays him 5 BTC back.
The problem is that if Sally is malicious, she might broadcast an earlier version signed by Johnny, thus reverting her payment back (e.g. after receiving goods).
But this problem can be prevented by revocation: when Sally pays to Johnny, she also revokes his previous payment by revealing her secret. After that if she still tries to broadcast it, Johnny will be able to get both his and her money back thanks to scripts which basically give priority to Johnny in this case.

You don't need to store the whole blockchain on your hard drive to run a node. It's enough to keep UTXO set.


it definitely doesn't. Currently max growth rate is 144 MB per day, ~52 GB per year. Growth is linear, not exponential. It looked like exponential growth because we were under the capacity.
Anyway, it will take 19 years to fill 1 TB disk with 1 MB blocks. We'll have much bigger disks commercially available then.
SegWit + HF increases block size 4x max, then it will take 19 years to fill 4 TB disk. Hardly a big deal.
As Pieter Wuille have postulated, normally transactions fill all the available space.
Back in 2012 we had a betting service called Satoshi Dice. To make a bet you send a Bitcoin transaction. It replies back with another transaction, paying you 1 satoshi to indicate that your transaction was processed, but you didn't win.
Obviously, this is very wasteful. Now it operates in a different way: you deposit bitcoins into it and can make many bets without making Bitcoin transactions.
So transactional load will adapt to capacity available, not the other way around.
@_date: 2016-02-08 20:06:36
Fee is actually specified per byte, but how big your transaction is depends on many factors which are outside your control. A small transaction is usually 250 bytes but can be much bigger.
The lowest fee which is necessary for your transaction to be consideredd is 5 satoshi per byte. For a 250 byte transaction it is thus 1250 satoshi, or $0.0046.
But as you can see here:  it might take days for your transaction to be confirmed, if at all.
With a 4x bigger fee there's a good chance your tx will be confirmed within an hour, so what Mycelium proposes is quite reasonable.

What I'm saying is that LN cannot work in practice because to run it at any significant scale it will require immense amounts of capital to be used by nodes -- much more than what banks use now.
Currently bank capital is typically less than 10% of all users funds it holds. They can do this because they use credit extensively, do settlements ASAP, etc. E.g. on FedWire something on scale of $2 trillion is being transferred every day.
Now the whole point of LN is that you wait until the settlement for as long as you can to minimize the number of blockchain transactions. Which needs you need a buffer high enough to cover transaction volume. So LN nodes will need about as much money as users use to transact. E.g. if a daily transaction volume is $1 trillion and you want to delay settlement by 7 days you need $7 trillion buffer to cover volume for 7 days. That's the basic math of it.
So the following scenarios are theoretically possible:
1. Very few people use LN, transaction volume is low.
2. A lot of people use LN, but blockchain settlements are frequent, like once per day
3. A lot of people use LN, and blockchain settlements are infrequent, but nodes about as much bitcoins as people using them
So my point is that 3rd scenario is impossible because it is basically unprecedented, while in scenarios 1 and 2 LN doesn't affect Bitcoin scalability.
Which means that LN cannot address Bitcoin scalability.
It's not about who can freeze what, it is about who holds the money if we assume that it works 100% as advertised.

No, that was just a bullshit excuse to make bitcoiners content.
Ether is meant to be money. You can use it in smart contracts, like lotteries, auctions, crowdfunding, etc. All these smart contracts need money, and ether is the only trustless currency on the Ethereum blockchain.
So the idea is that if people use these smart contacts (for all kinds of things: betting, prediction markets, collateral, fundraising, etc), they will use ethers.
You say speculation, but things I mentioned are already implemented, they just need to be polished and marketed to users.
Things which have non-zero volume now are related to speculation, e.g. ICOs are a big scene on Ethereum now, and there are decentralized exchanges for trading user-issued assets, etc. But it's not same as trading some random virtual assets, as there are actual projects operating in meatspace, so it's already pretty real, but in a very early stage, obviously.

Pruning does not affect security. At all. You still have a complete UTXO set, which is necessary to verify transactions. The only thing pruning affects is that _other nodes_  won't be able to get historic blocks from you.
Still in theory it is possible that each pruning node will host a small fraction of all blocks and new nodes will be able to bootstrap from partially-pruned nodes.
Pruning affects only storage, it doesn't solve the scalability problem: you still have to download the whole blockchain, you still have to store complete UTXO set, you still have to process every transaction ever.
Sharding is something entirely different, it would drastically affect security model, but also can _potentially_ result in higher scalability.
And then there are SPV clients.
So again, pruning, sharding and SPV are three different things. With pruning you still don't need to trust anybody, but it solves only a part of the problem.

I think you mean [preferred stock]( but it doesn't work like that.  Owners of preferred stock must be paid out of liquidation proceeds some fixed amount (e.g. $1 per share) before owners of common stock get paid. But this doesn't mean that corporation should have that sum in reserves.


This doesn't make much sense for shares, effectively it limits the risk of investor. But it is an interesting option, nevertheless, and it might be useful in some circumstances. We want to experiment with it and see how it works.
It is more interesting for bonds and private currencies, essentially it is a sort of internal collateral. It is particularly interesting if obligations are not denominated in BTC.
Say, I can issue a coin where $1 USD will be represented with 0.05 BTC. If value of BTC goes up value of this coin can go above $1 USD and issuer doesn't need to pay anybody. But if value of BTC goes down, issuer's liability goes up. So essentially it similar to an option: it is a bitcoin insured against value of BTC going down.

When one unit of currency is worth the same as 0 units of a currency, that means that currency is worthless, i.e. you cannot buy anything with. 
E.g. suppose `x` is how much a certain currency is worth in gold ("one unit of currency buys `x` grams of gold), then one unit of currency being worth same a 0 units can be written as equation:
      1 * x = 0 * x
which has one solution in the field of real numbers: 0.


This can be interpreted in several ways:
1. The accounting/transaction processing system was destroyed.
2. Markets were disrupted, so it is impossible to buy anything with that currency.
3. Supply went to infinity.

Nobody targets Bitcoin sidechains anymore. Well, there is truthcoin guy -- just one guy with a blog and no code. And Yours, which doesn't seem to be going anywhere. And Rootstock, which is going to emulate Ethereum on a sidechain.

Statefulness is, basically, an ability to keep track of things. In this context, on blockchain level.
E.g. let's consider an example of a trustless lottery: people put money into a contract, and after some time a randomly chosen participants receives the whole sum.
It is very easy to implement it using Ethereum model: a lottery contract can _keep track_ of who put money into it. I.e. you have a stateful contract with state automatically updated on blockchain level. Then having a list of participants, you can select a random one and award him a payment.
You cannot use this model with Bitcoin because Bitcoin does not have any "updatable" (stateful) things. Bitcoin only has transaction outputs which are either fully spent or not, and scripts which are stateless.
So if you do it with Bitcoin, you gotta maintain this state elsewhere. Perhaps you can make a server which keeps track of _intent_ to enter a lottery. Then it will build a transaction involving participants coins. Then it requests participants to sign it. If a participant is offline, it needs to be kicked out, and then you rebuild transaction without him.
This huge transaction will pay out money to an output which will eventually give money to a random participants. (Not sure if it's possible to do it with Bitcoin script, but at least it's theoretically possible with Bitcoin model.)
So as you see the difference here is that in case of Ethereum you have statefulness on the blockchain level. It might be more "expensive" in a way, but it is very easy to work with, as you have same mental model as with normal software. It's a "rich statefulness" in sense that it's not just a couple of variable, but an associative array of unlimited size at your disposal, so you are not restricted in any way.
With Bitcoin model you have to maintain state outside of blockchain, which requires:
1. a special server to be built (and hosted) for each application
2. wallet software which is aware of the protocol of said server
On top of that, it is much more fragile because states of different participants might be out of sync (e.g. one can drop out after registering), as they aren't synced using blockchain.
Since it's so complex, very few such applications exist.
I was trying to design a trustless Bitcoin derivative platform in 2011. I got stuck because besides implementing the service, I had to implement a wallet to work with it. Standard Bitcoin wallets would not work.
With Ethereum, a similar platform can be implemented in matter of _hours_. So yes, statefulness is important.
It's so sad that people in Bitcoin community prefer to play dumb when they discuss Ethereum. Yes, Ethereum has different goals and priorities, that doesn't make it OK to shit on something you do not understand.

And yet another attempt, now I'll go from familiar concepts to traditional bitcoin terminology:
Bitcoin is a payment system which, like other payment systems (banks, VISA, PayPal), allows people to send money from one account to another. But there are important differences:
 * Bitcoin is decentralized. This means that you don't need to go to a bank to open an account, you can do it yourself using Bitcoin software. You can create practically unlimited number of accounts for yourself. In fact, creating an account is so easy with Bitcoin that people often do that for each payment, e.g. when you give an invoice to a customer you would associate it with an unique account number for easy tracking of payment.
 * You send money not in dollars or euros, but in currency units which are called 'bitcoins'. Just like commodities, such as gold, they are traded on markets, so value of bitcoin fluctuates with time.
 * Issuance of currency units and transactions are controlled by a number of independent entities which communicate over internet. This means that nobody, not even government can block valid transaction or issue more currency than it is allowed by rules.
How it works: When you create a Bitcoin account, you get two things:
 * public 'account number', which is called an **address**: you can give it to other people to pay you for goods and services. It also can be used to check balance, but not to send money from this account, obviously.
 * private key which is used to unlock account for sending money. Bitcoin software keeps these keys in a **wallet** file. While bitcoins themselves are not stored in wallet, losing a wallet means that you don't have a key and thus won't be able to spend bitcoins, so they are effectively lost.
So you give other people one of your addresses to receive bitcoins, and you can use Bitcoin software (client) to send coins you received to other people, you only need to know their address.
You don't need to worry about having many accounts: Bitcoin software handles this automatically, combining multiple accounts when necessary.
This is targeted at people who have heard concepts such as "bank account", "payment system", "invoice", "commodities ... traded on markets", fluctuating price of gold. I bet any sane adult have heard this. I dunno about 6th graders, probably they've heard these words too, but just don't know what it means.
Anyway, it helps to establish similarity with established concepts and institutions, which helps to build trust. It implies that bitcoin is solid as a bank, but at the same time more convenient and independent (you can create accounts yourself).
But then it goes to traditional bitcoin terminology: addresses and wallets. However, introducing private keys at early stage helps to understand where security of system come from and what wallet actually is.
On the other hand, while you use simple words and short phrases, it might be hard to understand how the fuck wallet has an address attached to it. Then it has a factually incorrect statement that bitcoins are transferred from wallet to wallet.
And starting with physical transaction is, perhaps, not the greatest way to introduce bitcoins as its one of hardest problems with them. I would rather introduce it as a competitor of PayPal and only then mention that system might work in meat space too.
Note that I'm not saying that your introduction is bad, maybe it's good. `dsterry` just inspired me to look for other metaphors, and I found that it's easy to explain in terms of traditional banking software. But perhaps I use it more than an average person does...

No, that's not how it works. They should default and not repay the debt. Actually, that's what they're already doing.
Drachma is needed to restart the economy: government can't pay salaries in euros because it doesn't have any and cannot borrow after default. So government will pay in drachmas. Yes, they will be somewhat devalued, but that's the point: once local salaries go down Greece can produce products cheaper and thus get larger market share, improving its trade balance. Thus economy grows and in couple of years/decades everything will go back to normal?
Where do you see Bitcoin in this scheme? Greek people can acquire them by spending euros, and this just makes no sense unless euro gets inflated or becomes banned. Until then, they are better off just using euros.
Alternative blockchain makes little sense either...
What might make sense is LETS/Ripple -- it can be issued locally without wasting any resources and it can help the economy. (Basically, when government cuts spending and implements austerity measures people get less money, thus buy less things and this starts vicious cycle. It can be solved by barter to some extent, and LETS/Ripple is just a better way of barter.)

When you issue colored coins your client sends coins to itself to create a genesis transaction. Information about this genesis transaction is included into color definition (it is actually a main component of it), which makes it unique.
Name isn't unique, though. People can make coins with same name, but not with same ColorID.
Currently there is simply no way to issue more coins of same color. There are, however, several proposed mechanism.
Particularly, the most straightforward one is to link color to a particular bitcoin address (keypair) so that owner of a private key (wallet) will be able to make more coins of that color.
As for names, we plan to make a separate name registration service so that name will be unique within that service. E.g. if somebody will register FooCoins is bitcoinX registry, bitcoinX:FooCoins will be an unique name.

We should separate _vision_ as a goal of the project from _vision_ as a set of views on technical matters.
I agree that Satoshi's views on technical matters are mostly irrelevant now. Satoshi was never particularly rigorous, he mostly relied on intuition. And while his intuition was great, he's not omniscient, so he could get some thing wrong. And, of course, he didn't have information we now.
Satoshi's quotes are still useful for one thing: debunking Blockstream conspiracy theories. E.g. when somebody tells you that Blockstream conspired to do X, you can point out that it is actually the original idea from Satoshi.
But the goals of the project are still relevant, I think. If there is a disagreement about goals, it makes sense to look at the original goals.


But Bitcoin isn't acting on its own, it's maintained by people. By a relatively small group of people, so emergent properties do not kick in. So a sense of goal is very important.

All they need to do is to sign transactions.
I.e. user needs operator's signature to unblock his transaction output.
Operator only needs to make sure that he signs each output at most once. I.e. if user will try to double-spend and will create two transactions which use this output, operator will refuse to sign second one.
If operator signs double-spending transaction it can be detected and his reputation will be ruined.
To incentivize operators' work users might send them a small fee in each transaction which needs to be signed by operator.
 * operator has an incentive to sign it
 * if operator is caught double-spending he will lose this revenue stream
There is a risk for user: operator might stop providing signatures after user sent his money into escrow. But I'd say this risk is small because:
 * operator has an incentive to continue providing this service
 * user can put only some minimal amount of money into escrow, he can refuel escrow at any time

Moreover, it's a burden to network: network needs to provide blockchain to these new nodes, but many of them vanish not even completing the sync. 
Even if sync is complete and app is always on (which isn't good for users because it requires several hundred MB of RAM), it's still bad for network if it is hosted on a laptop which often goes to sleep. It makes tx propagation times less predictable.
So I think only people who are committed to run client 24/7 should run a full node, otherwise it's bad both for person who runs it and for the network.

I fail to see any value in this.
So, I guess, you want to prevent double spends. MTUT would rule out double-spends when you try to spend something spent a while ago.
But it won't rule out race-condition double spends, i.e when someone submits two valid transactions at once to different miners. Txn will be marked as unspent according to MTUT, so it is useless. You have to rely on miners rejecting wrong transaction.
So WHAT attacks does it guard you against? Miners accepting transactions they shouldn't have accepted? But then they could as well forge MTUT, just not updating it properly. You have to rely on miners if you're a thin client, no matter what.
The only thing it might be useful for is partial blockchain download -- but that helps new miners and transport nodes, NOT thin clients. I don't see why it would be adopted -- developers can say that if you want to be a miner, you have to accept certain traffic costs. And there are simpler solutions for this case: one can prepare a truncated block chain, sign it and make it available through BitTorrent, for example. You have to use some software to work with bitcoins and you have to trust software vendor (i.e. Gavin), so if you trust his signature you don't expose yourself to additional risks.
If you're really concerned about miners forging blocks, you can solve this through P2P DHT. I.e. if you want to check whether transaction was spent, you look it up on DHT and if it was, DHT will return a merkle tree which proves that it was spent in block chain. It gives you NO guarantees that transaction was NOT spent, but it might make forging attack statistically non-feasible under assumptions that miners have limited influence over DHT.
If you want lightweight relay nodes, it can also be solved through DHT. WRONG transactions would SOMETIMES be relayed, but it won't significantly change dynamics until 'bad guys' control DHT.
If you want lightweight miners, MTUT might be more useful than DHT (although very reliable DHT is probably just as good), but do you, really, with 200 MB per block? At that point you should consider other options rather than making it even worse with MTUT.

For example, on litecoinglobal you can see three different mining bond issuers each offering 1kh/s bonds. But one is twice cheaper than another. How so?

Basically, some people want bitcoins (to purchase something, or to keep them as savings) and other people want to exchange bitcoins to some other currency (say, they want US dollars to pay suppliers).
These people meet at exchanges. Current price depends on balance of supply and demand forces.
I think it largely depends on balance between growth of savings (including pocket money, temporary reserves and so on) and new coins mined by miners.
Currently miners get about 3600 BTC per day. Thus on average savings need to grow by 3600 BTC to keep exchange rate stable.
Some of these coins are kept by miners, other are bought by people who want (more) bitcoins.
Miners' reward is halved every 4 years, so in 4 years it will be 1800 BTC and so on. So it doesn't need constant influx of money to keep exchange rate stable. 
However, initially more and more people learn about Bitcoins and want to buy some, so this gradual issuance via mining is a good thing.

But in case you don't need to hide business itself maybe it's enough to hide share ownership? Say, officially you'll own shares, but you make a contract with bitcoin-share-owners that you will distribute dividends and act as a proxy for their interests.
Technically, it is a contract between two individuals, so business side is not affected. Likewise, you can distribute profits as it is individual-to-individual transaction.

Shares do not have a fixed price, they are priced by market, which takes into account all assets associated with those shares.
For example, for funds share price is usually around NAV/U (net assets value divided by number of shares issued). E.g. if fund has 1000 BTC in assets, 500 BTC in liabilities and it issued 500 shares, share price will be around (1000-500)/500 = 1 BTC.
If such share is represented with 0.1 BTC, share price will be around 1.1 BTC because "metal value" of coins should be added to share price. (Or you can think that "metal value" of all coins issued can be added to fund's assets, it is a same thing.)
So it simply pushes share price up without really affecting anything, thus it makes no sense. Effectively it just forcibly reduces investor's risk.
However, for bonds it might make a difference, but it depends on how bond conditions are formulated. As I wrote above, if face value is denominated in USD and bond is represented with a substantial amount of BTC, then it's more like a call option rather than simply a bond.
But bond issuer can say that he will pay back 0.1 BTC + 1 USD on a bond represented with 0.1 BTC.  This cancels effect of exchange rate.
But it's of course easier to make 1 bond 1 satoshi, it's unlikely that 1 satoshi will have a high volume. However if somebody is paranoid about it he can agree pay back 1 USD + 1 satoshi to make it fair and future-proof.

I wonder if it's possible to raise capital anonymously using bitcoins.
One of major advantages bitcoins offer is allowing people to bypass government's bureaucracy and limitations. In many countries trading on internet, especially internationally, is quite problematic/illegal/impossible, so bitcoin can solve this.
But problem is even worse for business rather than person-to-person trade: people who have some creative business idea have to work with large amount of paperwork and legalese bullshit, wasting time and money. Moreover, some things are just impossible.
There is always a problem of trust with anonymous payments. For trade it is sort of solved via escrow. I don't think that would work for business investments...
On the other hand, business investments depend on trust anyway, company can easily burn your money even if it is officially registered/you have contract etc.
So, ideally I want anonymity to a point of plausible deniability, so if government would accuse me of running an illegal company I'll be able to claim that I have no bitcoin business and don't even know what bitcoin is.
But would anybody with a sane mind invest into such 'anonymous' and 'plausibly deniable' business? Are there any tricks to make this working?

Also  is a channel for developers, and it is a good idea to keep development and politics separate.
Basically we should maintain that developers are simply writing code and are not responsible for any abuse like money laundering, illegal trade, sending money to "enemy" etc.
If boogeyman asks them about this they can claim that they have never  heard about it and do not approve it. A lot of software can be used for bad things, so it is easy to maintain plausible deniability.
However, if they will be caught talking about this matter (and especially if they will be caught encouraging such things) two things can happen:
 * developers might be seen being responsible for "bad things"
 * gov't might claim that Bitcoin is software which is made specifically for money laundering and stuff like that, so it makes sense to ban it

Well, they start in the same way. Then in a couple of years Bitcoin monetary base starts to grow slower. If we consider time frames like 50 years, there isn't a lot of difference: price index will greatly depend on demand.


OK, here are reasons:
1. There are no steps where generation drops. This steps cause additional price uncertainty. Price uncertainty is bad since it hurts merchants, i.e. they do not want to accept currency which doesn't have a reasonably stable exchange rate.
2. Bubbles are much less likely because there is no promise of deflation. No bubbles -&gt; stable exchange rate -&gt; more merchants.
3. Early adopter bonus is much smaller -&gt; it is perceived as "fair" -&gt; higher adoption.
4. Coins are lost over time. If loss is proportional to monetary base, at some point we'll reach equilibrium where loss per year = generation per year. At that point monetary base will be stable on average.
5. Stable monetary base means that deflation is less likely, and deflation is a bad thing. It's worse than stability.
6. Miners are compensated via generation, so this currency can be free from transaction fees. Transaction fees can be a serious problem for microtransactions.

You need to verify transactions to mine. To verify transactions you need to fetch a whole blockchain. Also you need to lookup previous tx for each txin in a block and to do ECDSA signature verification.

Yes, funding development is a good thing, in general. It increases chances of getting good things done. And we want good things to be done, right?
But, of course, you need to go into specifics to see whether it is a good allocation of resources.
For example, I would prefer grant process to be open, but right now it isn't clear that it would be such, that's why I wrote "sucks".

I believe that magnitude of a problem might be much higher. Imagine that in 100 years everybody uses Bitcoin and one bitcoin is million dollars equivalent. (E.g. you can buy a very nice house with it.)
Then some dude finds his grandfather's wallet with 5000 coins and he suddenly has 5 billions.
Worst part of it is that it is unbounded, i.e. some accident can make person wealthiest in the world, so he will be able to dictate rules to governments.
So I believe that old-coin-recycling should be a part of protocol if we aim for wide adoption, but majority of community wants this 'grandfather's wallet' problem to exist because they want to see themselves potential billionaires.

Yes. They can also represent bonds, private currencies, game items, etc.


That wouldn't be a problem in a typical case as people will use only tiny amounts of bitcoins to represent each unit. E.g. 1 share = 1 satoshi. It's unlikely that one share would be worth less than  0.00000001 BTC.
However, if for some reason it would be the case (maybe one share is represented with large amount of satoshis), it's possible to fix the situation by doing buyback.
Suppose 1 USDcoin is represented with 1 BTC. Then BTC appreciates and we want to issue USDcoin2 such that 1 USDcoin2 is represented with 0.5 BTC. To prevent USDcoins going to scrap, we will offer a buyback:
     Inputs;
     1 USDcoin from user
     1 USDcoin2 from issuer
     0.5 BTC from issuer
     Outputs:
     1 USDcoin to issuer
     1 USDcoin2 to user
     0.5 BTC to user
Amount of BTC on hands on both parties will be the same, but now user has USDcoin2 which is worth more than underlying BTC. And issuer can scrap 1 USDcoin he got.
But as I said it isn't a typical scenario. Essentially it allows people to use colored themselves as collateral for security they represent. (It makes more sense for private currencies than it makes sense for stocks and bonds.) But a problem with such approach is that frequent buybacks would generate too much blockchain bloat.

It gives you only like two bits of entropy. Definitely NOT worth the effort.
Best way to increase entropy lies not in "clever" schemes (which turn to be not so clever), but in picking random words.

@_date: 2012-12-05 08:42:30
1. Why would early adopters abandon them if they appreciate? :)
2. They can be used as a store of value.
My point is that widespread retail use in not necessary, and in some way might be even harmful (blockchain bloat).
Some niche uses (e.g. international money transfers where transfer of fiat money is problematic or costs too much) will help to stabilize exchange rate, and otherwise primary use would be store of value.
So I don't think people should focus on "retail" uses.
I'll give you an example: I was paid for programming work in Bitcoins. PayPal doesn't work in my country, and using bank transfer costs at least $25 and requires a lot of paperwork.
So Bitcoin has clear advantage over traditional solutions. (Compared to other shoddy e-currencies, Bitcoin is much more secure and anonymous.)
However there are no advantages for retail applications, paying with your USD credit card works well and gives you some protection, so why people insist on pushing it is beyond my understanding.
Most likely retail applications won't help to stabilize exchange rate since retailers will peg price to USD price and sell coins ASAP.
What we need for stabilization is financial markets.

This isn't quite true, banks need to maintain their liquidity to lend money. Why do you think they attract deposits?
On a basic level, if bank gets $100 in deposit it can lend $100 - reserve amount.
On a more advanced level, transactions people do are usually settled with money-only-central-bank-can-create, and there are many such transactions each day, so if bank will try to use money it doesn't have it will soon be dead.


I think you don't quite get what does it mean that person has money in a bank. It just means that bank's accounting system has some positive amount on that person's account.
This is pretty much like with BTCST web interface which shows you how much money you have invested, except that banks are subject to strict regulations.
So you can see BTCST as an incredibly shitty bank. Or you can see banks as BTCST which is run so well that there are very few problems for decades or even hundreds of years.

Let's forget 'official' terminology used in Satoshi's client and try to start over.
Bitcoin system allows you to open an unlimited number of transactional accounts which you can access through private keys in a key store. When you create an account you get its public account number which can be used to send money to it and to check balance, and a private key which is used to send money from this account to another account(s).
So, "address" = "account number", "wallet" = "private key store". But now this terminology is easily accessible to people who ever worked with banking software, and it also has a notion of a private key.
Also I've noticed that people think that coins are stored in their wallets, but if you explain that wallet is actually a key store, it becomes obvious that they are not, and feasibility of offline backup becomes obvious.
There are few drawbacks with this terminology too: usually new account is not created for each invoice (but if you can create unlimited amount of them, why not? It's convenient), and possibility of sending money from many accounts at once might be not obvious.
But, on the other hand, it is easier to understand anonymity concerns.
So I'd say that overall this terminology makes more sense for people who are more familiar with accounting than they are with networking.

Should programming article about PHP go to [or to [By your logic, to r/php. But then we won't have any articles about any languages in r/programming. Moreover, articles about obscure languages will be posted to obscure subreddits, making sure that very few people will notice them, thus making sure that obscure languages stay obscure.
Now check r/programming. There are articles about all kinds of languages, and many of them get many upvotes _and_ a lively discussion. Which is exactly what reddit is for.
Conclusion: your idea is bullshit.


It is a completely different story: those are on-topic, low-quality submissions. While you were complaining about slightly off-topic, high-quality ones.


Did you witness subreddits vs tags discussions? Digg had categories, reddit had subreddits. I also thought that links should be properly categorized, but later I understood a concept of community: reddit isn't a collection of interesting links, it is social news site. Social means that it is based on communities, not tags or categories. Later I understood that a concept of subreddit as a community is probably what made it so successful: people get a decent mix of topics while staying around some common theme. This is different from how, say, forums are organized, and this is probably a reason why I'm on reddit rather than on some forum.


Some of front page submissions:
 * Selling badass laser for bitcoin - BitLasers.com -- 13 up 2 down
 * Shopping on The Dark Web -- 48 up 19 down
 * Exchange your bitcoin for gold.. GOLD YOU CAN SHOVE IN YOUR ASS!!! -- bitmit -- 18 up, 10 down
 * Help deCrypto raise bitcoin for WikiLeaks! and get turned on in the process ;D!! -- 53 up 18 down
 * Crack Wi-Fi WPA passwords for bitcoin -- 10 up 1 down
 * An impressive milestone for me, anyway. 18 up 6 down
So, community clearly wants to hear about services and goods you can buy for bitcoins, or what people can sell to get bitcoins.
Why? People want to know that bitcoin economy is growing. They want to know about unique opportunities and so on. And they want to know where to spend coins or where to earn them.
It was ALWAYS like that in r/bitcoin. So there is absolutely no point in complaining about this.
And what's the point in posting article about SilkRoad in r/SilkRoad? They are already very aware of this, ffs. While some people in [might be not aware. I'm not planning to buy anything on SilkRoad, but I want to know what it is, for example.

OK, I guess I need to clarify: this can be used for exchange of any kind of assets, e.g. private currencies, stocks, bonds, whatever.
Value of private currencies will obviously depend on issuer. E.g. issuer can create cbUSD by offering to buy back 1 cbUSD token for 1 USD. If he fails, its value might drop to value of underlying non-colored Bitcoin.
Then how is this better than digital currencies pegged to USD, e.g. Liberty Reserve?
Here's how:
 * transactions can be performed anonymously, are not subject to any kind of control to same extent as bitcoins
 * not prone to outages to same extent as bitcoins
 * security of transactions does not depend on issuer, only on users themselves. And users can use things like offline wallets to make it very secure.
 * issuer can limit himself to work only with large sums which would reduce his costs
 * issuer is not responsible for trade performed via blockchain, so he can afford to have a different legal status. Say, it can be a trust fund based in USA overseen by respectable lawyers, rather than some offshore company which is totally opaque. (I should note I'm not an expert in this matter, I'm just a developer.)

So? They might carry a note with numbers, and also have banking application on their smartphone which allows to send money and check if they received any incoming payment.
I agree with `dsterry` that wallet is a forced metaphor: it is easier to explain it in terms of a decentralized banking application.
Bitcoin 'wallet' does not contain coins per se, it contains private keys. In a same way, you need private key (maybe in form of a hardware token) for a banking application. The only difference is that usually there is only one key in banking client, but for bitcoins we need one key per address = account.

I think natural laziness is a limiting factor, not "what is possible".
For example, I'm a programmer. Now when hardware is dirt-cheap and there is a lot of open source and free tools, even one programmer can make a lot. So I had a lot of cool ideas, but when I was working at 9-5 job I totally lacked time to actually implement them, as I was too tired to work in whatever free time I had.
So I quit that job and found another, with per-hour wage and totally flexible schedule, so I could do whatever I want whenever I want (as long as small fraction of time is spent on earning money).
Do you think I implemented a lot of awesome projects? No, I failed miserably. Sometimes I just didn't felt like doing anything. Sometimes I was really fascinated with some research projects which haven't led me anywhere. Only a tiny fraction of a free time was productively spent.
And I've observed similar behaviour in others. So I came to a conclusion that a majority of population can be fully productive only if they are fully committed to the project: i.e. they cannot NOT do it for some reason. Otherwise people will do stuff in 'hobby' mode which is unlikely to be very productive.
And a classic employment is a simplest and most effective way to get full commitment: you have to got to work at certain time, do something there, interact with people etc. There are other ways, of course, like you see in open source projects, for example.
But in a total freedom, as described in _A day in the life of a Resource-Based Economy_ above very few can be fully productive, as it requires some special skill, personality trait or something.
So a likely scenario is that some people will promise a lot, but do very little, as they can be easily distracted and like entertainment more than anything. Other people will find some bullshit project and spend immense resources on it claiming that it is important, useful and is going to work, while it isn't/won't. And finally, perhaps, there will be some heroes who actually do stuff which should be done, but they will be overloaded with requests from first two groups and thus very unhappy.

There is an anti-"glitch" protection on ICBIT: daily price range is limited, if price out of that range trading is halted. Thus if you have enough reserves for initial margin you won't be forcibly liquidated.
So hostile forced liquidation needs to be a multi-day operation, and you have plenty of time to bring more cash in. You can provide 100% coverage for your position (this is possible if you short BTC, I'm not sure about long position), then forced liquidation is simply impossible.
Note that whoever tries this trick takes a huge risk as people will be betting against him.
So it makes no sense for an exchange operator to cheat as long as majority of traders are sane and don't take too much risk.
(Of course, there is always a risk that exchange operator will simply run away with money...)

 * p2p file sharing is mostly for piracy (resolution: it depends, many file sharing software companies were shut down, however BitTorrent is alive)
So, basically, it matters how it looks like, and you better pretend innocent at the start.

Well... Reward on a prediction market is supposed to be proportional to uncertainty. I.e. higher uncertainty means higher reward.
Suppose market says that Obama wins with 99% certainty. Of course people who join this bet now should receive a tiny reward.
But a year ago when chances of Obama to win were, say, 60% people could get much bigger reward from their bet.
So on a prediction market like Intrade higher uncertainty means higher risk, but also higher reward.
Betting site tries to emulate this using time weight. Basically it just assumes that at start uncertainty is bigger than it is in the end, and so bets made at start get bigger weight (and thus bigger relative reward) than bets made near the end.
This is just a poor emulation of a real prediction market.


Prior to betsofbitco.in there was another betting site, moonco.in. And one day it went away with people's money. Was hacked or something like that.

At least with the original Ripple design, you were supposed to give credit lines only to people you know personally. E.g. your friends, relatives, etc.

Of course, it is better to write it down.

Both store-of-value and trade transaction value might be fragile, at least in theory, e.g.:
1. What happens if everybody suddenly thinks it isn't a good store of value anymore? (This happened many times, see: bubbles.)
2. What if people find a better way to transact?
However, there is a thing which can actually work as stabilizing factor: 1 Bitcoin-denominated debt and 2) debt paid off in Bitcoins.
1. Suppose that somebody needs to pay back 100 BTC in a year. No matter what happens throughout this year, he needs to buy 100 BTC from market. Which means there is some guaranteed demand for Bitcoins and some value.
2. If somebody needs to pay back $100 USD, but payment should be made via BTC, he needs to buy $100 USD worth of Bitcoins, thus market gets a guaranteed infusion of USD.
Of course, one transaction doesn't do anything (note that party which receives BTC will likely sell them), but if there is a stream of such transaction is stabilizes exchange rate and removes long-term uncertainty, so this market becomes more interesting for speculators.
So I believe that Bitcoin needs more and better financial markets. (Besides other things, of course.)

You can make private currencies on top of Bitcoin using so-called colored coins.
I can help you with setting this up, however I need to warn that the only currently available GUI client is based on Armory, so it requires:
 * running bitcoind or Bitcoin-Qt (which require ~4 GB on disk + couple of hundred megabytes in RAM)
 * Armory itself requires about 1 GB of RAM and it takes like 5 minutes for it to start
So it isn't for old computers... But on the bright side it works exactly like Bitcoin client.

It's much simpler than that. This change was a soft fork. But Satoshi didn't have a mechanism to introduce soft forks in a safe and controlled manner.
He didn't want to provoke attackers to try to destabilize the network during the soft fork, so he kept it secret. Here's a possible course of events:
1. Satoshi releases a new version with hard block size limit
2. Some fraction of users/miners download it (say, 25%), while the rest keeps using the old version
3. Attacker deliberately mines several 2 MB blocks.
4. If the majority of total hashpower haven't upgraded yet, they will mine on top of the attacker's chain.
5. But nodes which were upgraded will continue mining on the small-block minority chain.
6. We have two chains until the majority of hashpower upgrades to the new version.
There were no mining pools back then, so upgrade could easily last weeks or even months, during which nodes can be vulnerable to double-spend attacks.

Like what? It doesn't cancel any single feature, it just makes them more nuanced, like "X, but only as long as Y".
In other words, there is NO qualitative difference between network with millions of independent nodes and thousands of them, but there is a lot of quantitative difference.
To say whether quantitative differences can 'effectively' cancel 'pros' you need some quantitative information about bitcoin mining network structure, but it is a bit too early to speak about that as it's likely to change. Particularly, going from bounties to transaction fees would make a lot of difference, as individual transactions become a valuable resource.
E.g. a business which does a lot of transactions might want to cooperate with a mining pool which has a lot of hashing power: pool would accept transactions with lower fees, but would make a lot of money due to a large volume.
Now, why won't a number of busineses cooperate and lend some hashing power instead? It might be cheaper, they can control security themselves and they can be sure that transactions are settled in a timely manner.

All we need to do is to hide Bitcoin-Qt download from newbies and instead point them to web wallets, lightweight wallets and so on.
bitcoin.org has a page with alternative clients, but this is not enough! People should get a clear warning before they download Bitcoin-Qt.
So this is an organizational question rather than software question.
The only reason people still get Bitcoin-Qt as the first recommendation is inertia. It doesn't help the network and it doesn't help those people.
Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind is for professionals and for expert users who know what they are doing.

HFT exchange will probably make more sense for speculators. It will likely have lower spreads, so typically price will be better than on decentralized exchange. Cases when decentralized exchange offers a better price is an opportunity for arbitrage, but it isn't completely risk-free.


 This is a question of terminology. Colored coins are just naturally "decentralized" since they provide compatibility layer for different trading mechanisms. So multitude of ways to trade colored coins form a metaphoric decentralized exchange. But there is no THE decentralized exchange.
Question itself isn't meaningful. Why do we even want "decentralized exchange"? To avoid depending on a single centralized entity. Colored coins allow this, so they are at least as good as some "decentralized exchange", so they can act as a replacement. Also, colored coins enable HFT.
So the correct terminology would be that colored coins give us both benefits of decentralized exchanges, and also they are compatible with HFT.

Government spends a lot of money on fighting crime, money laundering, drug trade. If they think that Bitcoin helps with these afairs (and surely it does), it would be totally cost effective to spend like $10M on equipment to totally dominate Bitcoin mining and just mine empty blocks so no transactions will be registered in blockchain. It would be a tiny fraction of their crime-fighting budget.
So nothing really stops them, they just don't give a fuck. It's more about ignorance, bureaucracy and laziness.
But you shouldn't depend on it, it is totally possible that some cybercrime unit will kill Bitcoin to justify their existence. They need to show that they are doing something to get next year's budget, you know.


It won't help: namecoin uses same hashing algorithm.
If it will be demonstrated that gov't can shut down any cryptocurrency they will soon become worthless and won't facilitate transfer of value.


This is ridiculous. There is no direct financial benefit of illegalization of marijuana and other drugs, you know? But somehow government spends a lot of resources doing that.
Government works very differently from commercial organizations. Essentially, to get funding government departments need to show that they are working on serious problems. Profits and lack of thereof are totally irrelevant.
For example, TSA is absolutely useless and inefficient, yet they get billions each year for aircraft terrorism prevention because somebody demonstrated that this terrorism is a real threat.
Likewise if somebody shows that cryptocurrencies are used for terrorism, drug trade and tax evasion there will be anti-cryptocurrency unit with billions to spend.
As Bitcoin's security is tied to its price you need get to the exchange rate of like $10000/coin to successfully defend US government attacks.

Bitcoins are lent specifically for a purpose of selling them. USD received from this sale are held as a collateral. 'Loan' is only valid as long as price stays within a certain range. Once it's out of that range, position is liquidate -- BTC are bought back with USD held in collateral and difference is returned.
On a reasonably liquid market lender (exchange or broker) will never suffer loss.
Let's say I have one BTC and borrow nine, then sell them  So I now have $50 USD. When price moves to 5.55, BTC are bought back to get 9.009 BTC. Exchange gets its 9 BTC back and I'm left with 0.009 BTC instead of 1.0 BTC.

You look at mining in a very narrow sense: iterating through nonces. 
I look at it in more general sense: finding a block with hash matching the target. (I believe this was the original meaning before people started mining over RPC.)
The difference is that in later case you need to form a block before you start iterating through nonces, and that might be problematic.

Do you mean Bitcoin Foundation Grant Proposal Process in general?
Funding of standardization and stuff like that is generally a good thing, for obvious reasons.
So we probably should compare it to some baseline, e.g. to projects being funded directly by public.
Compared to that baseline Bitcoin Foundation might provide more mature approach, e.g. they'll pick really worthy, high quality proposals rather than some populist stuff. Also they can get sure that no competing proposal gets funded, so effort isn't wasted.
Also Bitcoin Foundation might be able to raise more funds for it since some people trust Foundations more than they trust "dudes on the internet".
On the other hand, there might be problems like:
 * Bitcoin Foundation might drive efforts more towards over-engineered, enterprise-y stuff
 * funds might be wasted on some expensive, useless crap. I really don't know what "protect, and promote bitcoin" is supposed to mean.
 * less diversity and direct democracy

You misunderstood it a bit: coloring bitcoins doesn't change their nature, it is just a convention among entities which are interested in working with colored bitcoins.
For people who do not care they are just normal bitcoins. One can spend his colored bitcoin just like he can spend his normal bitcoin, e.g. send it to Satoshi Dice. If their 'colored' value is lost, e.g. company goes bankrupt, people would stop caring about their coloring and they will return into normal circulation.


It is certainly possible, but there are two reasons to use main Bitcoin blockchain:
 * it is the most secure one
 * people might want to exchange their normal Bitcoins to colored ones without exchanging them into something else
But I guess eventually there might be specialized chains. Or, who knows, maybe Litecoin or Namecoin would embrace them. Namecoin has features which would be useful for stock exchange, for example...

We already had this discussion before, of course. I'll go through your suggestions.
1. Miners vs bookkeepers: Actual purpose of miners s to make sure that public ledger is synchronized. They do it by doing hard work, and they create new units of currency in process. I think that 'miners' is more accurate than bookkeepers here. Although, IIRC, 'bookkeepers' was used on a new Freicoin website. Anyway, you **don't need** to call this group when you explain bitcoin to someone. Just say that there are servers which are busy to make sure blockchain is in sync for everyone and cannot be tampered with, and they are compensated for their work.
2. Wallet is confusing because there is nothing like Bitcoin wallet in everyday life. Just call it wallet and explain how it works. All person needs to know is that he needs wallet to use his money. If person asks for analogy, say that it's like a cheque book.
3. _The "public key" could be named "address"_ -- This is already the case. You can say that address is like a bank account, but they are so easy to open that it's feasible to create a new address for each invoice, thus address is pretty much like invoice numbers.
4.  _but the "private key" should be called "a signing pen"_ -- What's wrong with "private key"? I'm sure average person is familiar with concept of "private" and "key". Aren't you overthinking this? It is a well established crypto terminology.


No, you just need to explain how it works. Don't just put a bunch of terms and assume that person understands. Just a couple of phrases can tremendously help with understanding.


This is a very misguided statement. Nobody is hiding anything, people just to tend to use short and apt terms when they speak about something.
Bitcoin is just different from what people experience, and so you shouldn't assume that somebody can understand it by just looking at terms.
@_date: 2012-11-26 09:02:57
It won't work because of transaction fees. Transaction fee is 50000 satoshi, IIRC, and you have to pay it with each transaction if you have micropayments and you want them to be relayed within bitcoin network  and to be included into blockchain.
So you need constant influx of satoshis for tx fees, and normal bitcoin client won't keep them separate from your "precious satoshis", so they are going to be mixed.
On the other hand, colored bitcoin client keeps track of which coins are colored and it pays fees only with uncolored coins.

Issuer and investors might still get into legal troubles. But it's kinda flexible: investors can own securities anonymously. And issuers have many options: from not giving a fuck to using intermediaries and doing it legally.
People have outlined couple of options [here]( and [here](


We only need to go through history only when new color definition is added, after that we just do same maintenance as a normal bitcoin node. (Basically, we just need to store color for each unspent tx output.)
For a lightweight client it is a bit different: it needs to go through a history of a colored coin he received, but I guess it will be much smaller than total bitcoin transaction history, so that's OK. We are making a server which will assist lightweight clients with this.


Yes. This is what I meant by p2p exchange. We have already written code to do this, but it needs a bit more work.

Yes, it's not used anymore, my point is that it's the simplest scheme which _could_ be used (and was used) _instead of_ transaction fees.
@_date: 2012-12-13 01:07:12
Forwarding nodes exist only because running bitcoin software is cheap.
If transaction volume goes up, it won't be cheap anymore. If running a node costs you money then majority of forwarding nodes will vanish.
Costs of running a node are roughly proportional to transaction volume.
Larger fees reduce transaction volume. Lower volume also means smaller blocks.
So miners are supposed to find a sweet spot between hardware costs and fees.

Yep, it's useful as a currency too. However different currencies might have different purposes.
Say, I receive USD from foreign customers, but I need to exchange them to a local currency to buy groceries. It doesn't mean that USD isn't a currency, it's just that in my case it is useful for international transactions.
My point is that we might not need to see Bitcoin in retail trade. There are even reasons to not use it for such thing: widespread use will be a huge burden on blockchain, and we don't know how to solve scalability problems. It might be an excellent choice for international trade, but maybe not for small-scale retail.

People who think it is relevant are seriously economics-illiterate. Math-illiterate too.
The fact that they need three rounds of quantitative easing just shows that monetary **BASE** isn't particularly important metric. What matters is money **SUPPLY**, **velocity** of money, and, generally, price-index based inflation.
Basically, what matters is what part of money is in active use. Part which isn't in use does not matter much, unless it suddenly goes into active use.

And do not use "password". Use passphrase.

It must be known to parties which are participating in it, not to the network. One way to implement P2SH is to embed the hash of an actual contract into a wrapper contract. When a wrapper contract receives a message it checks whether hash matches, then executes code contained in the message.
So it can be pretty much identical to Bitcoin P2SH.
Obviously, parties who have access to both contracts can easily emulate the execution process and use an appropriate amount of gas etc.


Bullshit, it can easily do MAST. And, being Turing complete, it can emulate any other computation model.
Seriously, any blockchain idea you have, it can be implemented on top of Ethereum. There might be some loss of efficiency, but on the other hand, it's easy to deploy.

Efficient market smoothes out price spikes and movements. Price went up since ~ Dec 30, there is no reason for it to jump up again during event we're talking about.
You can anticipate higher trading volume, and it indeed seems to be higher since Jan 1 to Jan 21. Again, you can try to explain that with speculators buying coins since Jan 1 and selling them after show was aired. So volume is higher both before and after an event and you don't see a sharp spike

Yes, but in context of bitcoin we would accept "signed by guys who did a lot of work" instead of proof. Proving that transaction wasn't spent at least until a certain block might be useful as a part of some complex design, but not by itself.


Certainly not. Original design allows miners to prune transactions which were already spent, they can do this themselves and it doesn't require any changes to protocol.
A thing like MTUT could speed up initial download of a chain, but there are simpler ways to do it.
Miner can even skip downloading blockchain altogether and resort to polling others (trusted ones, obviously), but I doubt practicality of such solution.
E.g. some service might periodically make a snapshot of block chain in form of MTUT and obtain signature of trusted 3rd parties (e.g. Gavin) after they verify correctness. Then if it's made available for queries it can be used instead of blockchain by miners.
But that only makes sense if network traffic is cheaper than disk space.
Maybe that would be relevant to things like p2pool.


Well, it's strictly superior to storing a whole block chain on disk in one location. As for growth, we can expect that network grows too and so do capabilities of each node.


Yep, there was discussion on forum; I'm totally for that, actually.

Moreover, once such attack is announced, Bitcoin price will plummet and so miners will go away, making attack much cheaper.

OK, I see. Paying off external debt with drachmas would be a ridiculous solution. (Not impossible, though.)
But government also has liabilities to own citizen (pensions, salaries of government workers and so on), which also can be seen as sort of implicit debt, and paying off these liabilities with freshly printed drachmas sort of makes sense. Basically, it's the only solution aside from defaulting on everything and dissolving government.
So in some way parent commenter was right.
And if we would consider systematic use of Bitcoin, it will only make things worse: amount of bitcoins is fundamentally limited to much larger extent than amount of traditional currencies, so economic activity would just halt. E.g. if you're a business owner and you're temporarily short on money you can borrow some in bank. (It happens all the time as some time goes between purchase of raw materials to sale of goods, and it's not always predictable.) But bitcoin banks are incredibly immature, so in a hypothetic bitcoin-based economy business will just halt its operations.

 TRUNCATE-TO-160-BITS is non-secure hash function: it preserves entropy of first 160 bits, but it has no mixing whatsoever and it is trivial to find collisions by changing other 96 bits.
Now how would that affect security of Bitcoin addresses if we do this replacement?
If you don't see how it is relevant, TRUNCATE-TO-160-BITS can serve as a model of a totally broken RIPEMD-160.

No. It would require some support on client side:

 * identify trusted zero-conf transactions
Since clients currently do not do that service makes no sense. (There is some multi-sig support in blockchain.info wallet, but it is less convenient than it could be, I think.)
However, if, say, some game community is going to start using bitcoin they can all use same client software, and it would be much easier to organize fast-transaction service for them.

But the problem I see is that typical vocal libertarians which can be found on internets often ignore complexity of the issues and claim that simply following some ideas would give us a better future.
Well, it doesn't work this way, in my opinion. Government currently has an important role, and we cannot simply remove it.
But perhaps new technology would allow us to explore the alternatives, and some of them will work so effective that society will transform itself to have less reliance on central governments.

As you might know, there are some "alt-chains": cryptocurrencies based on same concept as Bitcoin (and, often, same code), but with some modifications. Some of these alt-chains aim at making a hostile take-over harder.
Particularly I'm now working on one of them, and there are some promising preliminary results. It won't be completely immune to shutdown attacks, but much more resilient than vanilla Bitcoin.
We can expect that if technology will be developed in alt-chain eventually it would be integrated into Bitcoin. (OR we can switch to some alt-chain.)

Yes, as long as code does what they say it does. (Although I'm not sure... Does it download block header and verify merkle subtree of incoming transactions?)
So the problem is auto-update. It is definitely NOT secure without Verifier. (Same is probably true for any client which silently auto-updates.)
With Verifier it is still not as secure as installing something yourself as attacker can hijack both github account and BCI servers to get some money. I'm sure there is a constant stream of people who log in and get new version of scripts, so they can get shafted.
On the other hand, desktop software is updated less frequently, like once in a couple of months, maybe, so fewer suckers will be exposed if attacker hijacks distro servers. Also you don't have to run it right away. Say, you can download it today, but run check signature and run tomorrow. If there is a problem with server being hijacked, somebody would mention it.
Also, I don't trust browser security mode. Usually your sensitive scripts will be run in same process with scripts from outer network, and data might be stolen through some browser hole.
So I'd rather trust software which is explicitly installed.

Multi-signature escrow, i.e. output is controlled both by trusted party and by user. If another party trusts that trusted party not to double-spend then he can accept transaction immediately.
Obviously if your business is escrow it makes no sense to ruin your reputation over $100 double-spend.
If you are talking about $1M worth transaction then obviously it's better to wait enough confirmations.
There are solutions which allow even higher scalability at expense of higher level of trust requires. Still it isn't like you give operator all your money.

You indeed have to pay larger fee, but it is less than 0.0005 per address/input. (Using multiple inputs is somewhat more efficient than sending many transactions.)
So, basically, when you accept payment add 0.0005 BTC to the price and that would cover any fees.

IP address can be [spoofed]( i.e. a host can send packets pretending that they come from other host. It's rather hard and not always possible due to filtering on routers, but sometimes it happens.

By the way, while we are at it, any person who understands math will understand that if mining gives, say, 50 coins per block forever it means zero inflation eventually, because coin generation to monetary base ratio goes to zero with time.
But Austrian types are math-impaired, thus they will see this as a horrendous keynesian inflation.
This example only shows that they are detached from reality, nothing else. Likely because they are get-rich-quick types in their hearts.
@_date: 2012-08-20 11:57:48
You do not understand math of this process.
Certain fixed amount of coins is generated each year. 
In the second year, _monetary base inflation_ is 100%. In the third year it is 50%.
   
    2: 100%
    3: 50%
    4: 33%
    5: 25%
    ...
    15: 6.6%
    ...
    51: 2%
    ...
    101: 1%
    ...
    n: 1/(n-1)
So in 50 years or so inflation is rather low.
But not that we are talking about _monetary base inflation_ here, not price index based one! If we assume that cryptocurrency gets wider adoption over time, it will actually be deflationary w.r.t. prices.
So I strongly recommend using 5th grade math instead your Austrian "wisdom": it works better.

Coin price is determined by market forces, which is basically supply and demand. If current market is dominated by investments and new purchases we can assume there is a relatively stable inflow of dollars. There is also relatively stable inflow of bitcoins. Bitcoins are sold for dollars, so price is relatively stable.
Now if inflow of bitcoins halves while we have same inflow of dollars we get price of one bitcoin doubling.
Of course reality is more complex than this, for example, when price will go up existing bitcoin owners will sell, so it will less than double.
But it's not correct to assume that all future changes are already taken into account: this would assume that all agents are 100% rational, which is bullshit

Blockchains are like massive multiplayer online economic games to me, I'm always happy to see a good action :D
@_date: 2012-08-20 15:35:31
1. It might be cheaper to make blocks without transactions, i.e. no resources are spent on verification. No need to store full blockchain... 
2. Alt-blockchains are often blocked with empty-block attacks, presumably to keep Bitcoin dominating.
It was speculated that Mystery Miner who mined empty blocks was a botnet operator. 
I think it makes sense: you can make a small self-contained package which mines coins on infected computers and sends them to your address. It does not need to connect to a pool, so you suffer no overhead. It does not need to waste time downloading full blockchain, knowing last block and address to send coins to is enough. (It's possible that client computer won't have disk space for a blockchain.)

Ugh. Things like zipconf.com are _centralized_ services based on _faith_ which really don't have anything to do with Bitcoin which is distributed and based on cryptography. They just use bitcoin as a unit of exchange and as a final form of settlement, but they are definitely not bitcoin-y.
The whole point of Satoshi's work is that proof-of-work can be used to improve security of payment system, and proof-of-work is definitely not instantaneous, by definition: you have some work to do.
You handwave Satoshi's work away claiming that it's not important and that developers can solve this if they want to.
Bitcoin in the first place is a clever protocol which enables secure payment system.
But people like you care only about bitcoin units but not bitcoin payment system: they see it either as a libertarian dream of 'private money' or as a get-rich-fast scheme.

People are lazy. They won't work unless there is a necessity. (Or, maybe, they'll do some shitty art and claim that it's work.)
Also, some people work harder than others. Some people work on dangerous jobs. Some people want to work for a few months per year and be free for the rest of it, while others are OK with working pretty much each fucking day. Some jobs require decades of learning.
Some people have to care for their children/spouses/parents, so they can put less time into work, but need more goods.
So there is a lot of opposing forces. And money, being an universal medium of exchange, is a solution (together with markets): person gets money for his work, according to various factors such as necessity of this work, skill required and so on. Then he can spend it on goods. He can himself decide how much he should work, what should he learn and so on.
Wherever markets fail to implement "fair" solution it is possible to create social safety net: things like social security, medical insurance and so on are compatible with money.
Any solution which is incompatible with money will likely be insanely complex and contain a lot of loopholes for lazy/greedy people to exploit. Also I don't think it would be any better than money.
You can see example of planned economy in USSR: they still used money, but employment was pretty much guaranteed and most goods were so cheap that money was pretty much irrelevant, and expensive stuff was subsidized.
So they have pretty much solved money issue, but then they faced problem with inefficiencies and scarcity. There was almost no incentive to innovate, to develop new products or products in larger quantity. Incentives which existed were artificial and thus were easy to circumvent. For example, engineers could intentionally claim that product they're developing is less reliable than it actually is, then in a year change some insignificant detail and say that it got more reliable to get a bonus, in a year change something else and get another bonus.
I guess majority of people understand that communism or money-less society isn't realistic when they are teens, as they see there is no magic transformation from children to adults: adults are just as lazy, but they HAVE to work because they need MONEY to feed themselves.

The reason to reclaim them is to make monetary base stable and to incentivize miners. Got it?
1. There will be no deflation.
2. No inflationary hikes either.
3. No "suddenly wealthy people".
4. Miners have an additional incentive.
5. Transaction fees can be smaller.
So, there are 5 important advantages.
I see no disadvantages at all.


Miners can do whatever fuck they want in either case.
Why cannot they keep coin generation at 50 coins per block forever?
If there is a conflict of interest, it already exists. But, somehow, it works.


This is bullshit, I'm not against saving at all.
It's just you Austrian/libertarian guys who are paranoid. You should check your psychiatrist, maybe you should take meds or something.

That whole post is a brainfart. PoW's main function is securing the ledger, making history immutable. The fact that it is also use to issue new coins is not essential.
We can easily imagine cryptocurrencies with no block subsidy. E.g. suppose a government of some country will give 1 coin to each citizen. All the issuance will be done in one massive genesis block. The blockchain will be secured by PoW, same algorithm as used by Bitcoin, however, miners will get no block subsidy, they will only earn transaction fees.
So exactly 0 joules are spent to create coins, will they be worthless?
Another way to do an initial allocation is to give coins to people who burn dollars on camera. E.g. you burn $100 note =&gt; you get 100 d-coins. And again, PoW can be used for consensus, but miners will only earn tx fees, no subsidy.
And then there are PoS-based coins, by Adam's reasoning they should be worthless, but they aren't.
Yet another example is Counterparty. Counterparty tokens were created through proof-of-burn, 2.6 million XCP tokens were created through burning 2125 bitcoins, so if you count "joules spent" then one XCP token should be worth 0.000817 BTC. You don't need complex AI to assay this, it's just basic arithmetics. Yet they are now being traded at almost 9x that price. Do you think that people are stupid, can't do basic math, or what?
Maybe, just maybe, crpytocurrencies aren't "a proof o Joules spent", but are something else.
I wonder if is confusing Bitcoin with hashcash on purpose or he's fucking with.
BTW it's actually possible to make a currency which will be a "proof of Joules spent" (in a way), to do that you should make block subsidy and difficulty constant. In that case people will always be able to convert energy to coins at the same rate. Thus a price of that coin won't be able to rise above the price of energy required to mine that. In other words, that coin won't make anyone rich. Something tells me that it won't get as popular as Bitcoin, though.

Content discovery isn't a standard pastebin functionality, however some of them allow replies and have a list of recent pastes, which would be enough, in theory. (Also, some pastebins can announce pastes on IRC automatically...)

No, that's not how it works.
It leaves block chain on disk as is, but writes unspent transaction outputs into a separate database. Only unspent transaction outputs are used to verify transactions.
However, if somebody wants to start from scratch, they need full blockchain.


It doesn't speed up initialization, new version simply uses another database for transaction index.


No. There is no such thing as better of worse verification, each full node performs full verification.
More miners is better because risk of collusion is less. However new nodes do not become miners.

Well, currently there is no pruning, so it is hard to say how it could look like if there was pruning. Perhaps whole architecture would be different.
Armory doesn't only look for spendable transaction outputs, it shows you history (ledger), and to do it in needs to scan whole blockchain.
Of course, this information could be cached, and in that case full scan won't be necessary. But this isn't how it is implemented now.
If we are talking about theory, we definitely need to go through historic parts of blockchain when we add a new color definition. But after that you can simply maintain a list of colored utxos.

2. Indeed, it's mostly a protection against blockade attack. (I.e. someone wants to kill a currency.)
3. It doesn't need to be a hard limit, maybe we'll just give blocks with coins some competitive advantage.

Short term strategy is inherently riskier since short-term exchange rate behavior might be affected by relatively small events which are hard to predict.
Thus selling/buying frequently is riskier than holding and not selling, but potentially it's more profitable.
It's easier to see it if you use bets on exchange rate (e.g. futures) settled in BTC instead of direct selling/buying: you stay in BTC all the time, but amount of BTC you have fluctuates depending on how good you are at predicting short-term behavior.

You aren't supposed to 'change to it', right now bitcoin is complementary to other currencies. It is useful in certain niches.
For example, it's an easiest way to send money to some individual on internet: you just need to know his address. It is better than PayPal because:
 * it works in all countries where there is internet (in many countries PayPal can't be used to receive money)
 * fee is negligible
 * sending tiny amount is feasible
 * transfer is pretty much instantaneous
 * there are no problems with fraud, complains, crime investigations
Imagine dude recorded an awesome song on Youtube and you send him a couple of dollars via paypal to buy him beer. Next week you're interrogated by police because that dude is drug seller and they suspect that you've paid for drugs.
Now if you paid with coins instead, it would be much harder for a police to trace these coins back to you.

Reddit is significantly more expensive than your average internet site because it is very dynamic: every upvote needs to be counted, stored in the database, and it should immediately affect comment score. So caching is not an option, to render each comment page server needs to perform thousands of queries, each time.
Then, company of any size might be suffering financially. Say, if company's revenue is $100 billion, but your expenses are $101 billion, then it is not profitable, there is $1 billion of loss. If it cannot be made profitable then it's better to liquidate this business which generates $100 billion in revenues since running it makes you no money.
Finally, we aren't really donating, we are paying for service. Service reddit provides is ridiculously expensive compared to sites which simply show static pages, and even to forum sites.
Gold users get extra features which add even more load on servers. Maybe it's not worth $30/year, but that's a matter of personal preference, of course. (I think it's a bit too expensive, $10/year would be more appropriate, I'd pay that without hesitation.)

Namecoin can be used for same purpose, e.g. it is possible to declare that ownership of a certain names  represents ownership of some asset, e.g. names XYZ_i i=1..1000 represent shares of company XYZ.
However it's kinda impractical to use names as currency because of divisibility problem, i.e. you need to register a shitload of names.
Otherwise, colored coins on top of namecoin would be nice as it is possible to assign ticker right in blockchain, but the downside is that things will be naturally traded in namecoins...

Usually it is a good idea to make fees zero, at least for small transactions for a first couple of months. Call it a beta testing period. Then set up fees according to information you've collected.
If you set high fees from the start you won't know how many users you're missing because of fees.
It makes a lot of sense if you cannot provide a lot of liquidity yourself: zero fees would attract arbitragers who have bitcoins but have no interest in withdrawing SEK. Fees would eat their profits.

It is very unlikely that SHA-256 will be broken for purposes of bitcoin mining anytime soon.
Yes, shit happens. There is risk in _any_ business. The question is, is this risk too high? I don't think so.
ASIC is just way more cost effective in the long run, so somebody HAS to do it some day. One who does it first wins big time.
If you structure it as a public company, for investors it would be as risky as pretty much any other investment. Yeah, it can go under, but any public company can.
So it looks like Vladimir is doing it right. I dunno about this hw sale, he will lose a lot on it, but I guess he has a plan...
He could use existing hardware and mining revenue as a collateral. But, on the other hand, if ASIC plan works, selling GPU mining rigs will be way harder :)

With current transaction volume and fee structure jacking up fee up to 0.6 USD per transaction would cover current miner compensation.
Sure, with 0.6 USD fee we'd have much less Satoshi Dice transactions and thus lower transaction volume, but my point is that if tiny fees can give non-negligible reward to miners we shouldn't worry about lacking fees too much.
However if Bitcoin will have to handle retail transaction volumes miners will have to invest into high-end servers just to handle blockchain, that coule be a problem. (Miners can use ultraprune, of course, but getting into this business or simply verifying correctness will be incredibly costly.)

OK, let's go a bit deeper into the theory of it.
Consider a (crypto)currency which has a notion of flows as first class objects as well as regular coins and allows free conversion between the two. That is if you receive a flow and do not redirect it, it materializes in form of coins which you can spend.
In that case yes, the only advantage of flows is frequency, that is, in a way, it can improve scalability, as you can set up flow just once and it can exist for years. So you won't need to send regular transactions.
However, an interesting thing happens if we add [demurrage]( a la Freicoin: money which sits in a wallet slowly disappears (is sent to miners, basically). This changes economic properties of money: people get an incentive to spend money ASAP, or lend it: lending at 0% is better than keeping it in a wallet. As Feicoin people say it, it is free of the basic interest.
Now if it also has flows, there is an incentive to use them: if money is sent via flows, it is not lost due to demurrage. With an increased demurrage rate, this incentive becomes higher and higher, and economic properties change even further, it becomes like a hot potato where if you can't spend it or pay forward you're just losing it.
And if demurrage rate is infinite, we get a pure flow money, which doesn't exist in a standalone form. If you receive a flow of 100 u/s, but declare outgoing flows for only 90 u/s, 10 u/s gets lost.
So a hybrid system which allows both flow and transactional money has same benefits as a system which allows micropayments, but pure flow money is something very different.
Similar structures already exist. E.g. PageRank. Site's PageRank depends on number of links pointing to it weighted by their PageRank. Having high PageRank is beneficial as it results in a bigger stream of visitors, which can be monetized. But it's not something you can store or somehow convert to PageRankCoin. (You can however sell a site with high PageRank for money.) 
Same thing with visitor traffic: it is something valuable, when your site gets visitors you can either try to convert them (to buy your product) or monetize them by sending them to other sites (ads). But you cannot just store visitors.
The core idea of PageRank is this: you have relationship of form "A endorses B", some a priori ranks and a weighting function, and using that you can compute rank for every node. In case of PageRank itself, it is implied that a link from site A to some B implies that a webmaster of site A thinks that site B might have useful information, thus it is sort of an endorsement. This can be applied to any other kind of relationship, say, vertices can be people instead of sites, and it can be "A likes B" relationship, then we get something like a popularity rank.
Now going back to cryptocurrencies, "A directs flow to B" can be interpreted as "A endorses B", and so we can expect some PageRank-ish properties. Particularly, if we liken naive karma systems like that on reddit to primitive pre-Google search engines, a more advanced flow-money based karma can be more useful and might supplant tipping, for example. 
When you tip somebody you permanently lose something you own, but when you 'endorse' him you don't, it doesn't cost you anything, but is potentially valuable to the receiving party. Likewise, adding a link from your web page to external website doesn't cost you anything, but is potentially valuable to that external web site as it increases rank and number of visitors. So again, there is a clear distinction between flow money and normal transactional money, regardless of payment frequency/microtransaction possibilities.

[Theory]( (I also vaguely remember there is a service which helps with 'listening'.)
Casascius POS already works as a proof-of-concept, and possibly as a reasonable practical implementation.
Adding buzzwords like "raspberry pi", "NFC", "zipconf" adds absolutely no value and solves no problem. This is just an exercise in mental masturbation. 


I think that seller should accept currency which buyers have, in a way that is convenient for them. I really doubt that anybody actually wants to accept bitcoin since only a tiny fraction of customers will have them.
But if some location has abnormally high number of bitcoin-bearers, of course, some POS solution might be warranted. But if it's just an experiment it makes much more sense to use existing hardware (smartphone or PC) which is also used for other purposes and not something dedicated. (And Raspberry Pi-based POS is going to be dedicated according to zealots.)
I do not believe that POS systems will have with bitcoin adoption. Most likely users will acquire bitcoins to spend them online. There is a lot of niches where Bitcoin has huge advantage over existing systems, so exploring them first makes much more sense.
Just paying somebody online is PITA. E.g. my father recently tried to pay somebody in a different country using paypal for auction item purchase, here's what he had to do (he didn't have a suitable bank card before):
1. Go to bank, open an account. 30+ minutes.
2. Go to bank, put money into account. 30+ minutes.
3. Register paypal account, add card.
4. Call bank, authorize internet payment.
5. Go back to paypal, add a card again.
6. There is a limit as card was not verified yet.
7. Register in bank's internet banking system, which is multi-step wizard, takes at least 30 minutes.
8. Oh, bank doesn't display transactions instantly, wait, maybe 3 days before paypal account can be verified which would allow paying in full.
Just registering on sites and calling bank took 2 hours despite I knew process very well and was internet-savvy. My father had a very vague understanding of what is going on and why this shit is required even after I've explained everything to him, and he's not the dumbest person.
So... It's probably easier to install bitcoin software and get bitcoins from some dudes locally. Bitcoin can easily compete in this sphere because 'normal' payment systems are incredibly fucked up and poorly work with each other.
But competing with cash is something different: everybody has cash, knows how to use it and handling cash isn't hard. So it's hard to compete with fiat cash.

It doesn't reduce size of blockchain per se, it simply makes it possible to delete old parts of blockchain from disk when they are not needed anymore. Also it speeds up initialization.
However if you delete parts of blockchain (which isn't implemented yet, by the way), you won't be able to help new clients to start (as they need to download whole blockchain from start). Whoopsie.


There are different kinds of p2p.
Distributed Hash Tables are typically designed to be scalable, so indeed more nodes is better, and each node handles only small amount of information.
However Bitcoin now uses a 'broadcast network' structure where all messages are broadcasted to all nodes (ideally). This means that with more nodes you actually get worse propagation times (all being equal). Also slow nodes can slow down global propagation speeds and so on.
In theory more nodes give you better DDoS-attack resistance. However only those which accept connections count. Ones which are behind NAT simply mooch off network resources.

"Colored coins" are just tokens which represent ownership of some asset. It is possible to make many different systems which would work with same tokens and thus will be compatible with each other.
It is possible to implement centralized HFT on top of colored coins: just block traders' coin in multisig escrow, then do trading in your centralized system, and at the end of a day do a settlement.
At the same time people who do not need HFT can trade coins directly. It might be slower, but they do not need to mess with escrows.

Short means you have negative amount of it. I.e. you borrowed an asset, sold it (so you don't have it anymore), and now you owe it.
If you've just borrowed an asset but didn't sell it, you're neutral on it, neither long nor short.
Of course, in investing having an asset means that you hope that price goes up, and owing means that you hope that price goes down.

Ehm. Currently transaction fees are used simply to prevent spam, there is no market for transaction fees, and so it's meaningless to compare them to anything. They do NOT represent market rate.
However, it is hard to tell how transaction fee market can function. Marginal costs of adding a transaction to block are tiny. It makes sense to add pretty much any non-free transaction, unless you hit block size limit.
Blockchain bloat is, however, a significant burden. And it is a burden for future miners. So essentially we get a situation similar to tragedy of the commons/prisoners' dilemma.
I suspect we'll witness a "gentlemen's agreement" among miners to have at least some minimum fees, and it can be enforced as a rule among a majority of miners so that miners who violate this rule won't get their blocks in the main chain.
Basically, fees will have to become a de-facto part of the protocol.
I should note that if simple no-spam policy already gives us 1% of a necessary sum that's already good.

It doesn't work that way. Settlement is done on settlement date and it is based on external spot price (mtgox day average on that date).
You just need enough reserves to survive until settlement, if you have reserves operator CANNOT do anything against you without violating rules in a very obvious way which would be he'll lose his business.
If price is driven down people will be able to buy at that price, which would mean a very good profit for them.
If price is low but people cannot buy then operator's shenanigans will get detected and he'll have to close his business.

At high transactions per seconds rate "block construction" costs are non-negligible. 
With average transaction size of 500 bytes and 1000 transactions/second rate blockchain grows by 43 GB per day, 16 TB per year. Even with pruning, you need to download and verify whole blockchain before you start mining...
If transactions are almost free people will do blockchain transactions in large quantities, just for shits and giggles, basically, so you can get to tps above 1000. Fees will act as deterrent for those sorts of things, bringing tps down to reasonable level.

There is no such thing as "the appropriate reddit for submission". Subreddits are not tags. If they were tags, they would be called tags.
Subreddits are communities of people. If people are interested in content, then it's relevant to subreddit. Content might be relevant to multiple subreddits, obviously, and it's perfectly OK.
Submitting only to small, most appropriate subreddit would make larger ones totally boring, if not completely empty.
Mod's job is mostly preventing spam. Actual content filtering is done via down and up voting.

I'd say it is a wrong dichotomy. 
With Bitcoin, you still need a 3rd party service (miners) to confirm that your transaction is not a double spend, you cannot do it yourself. It's just that algorithm allows you to trust any "service operator" with considerable hashing power: double-spend becomes expensive.
We can use different criteria for picking whom to trust. For example, we can trust operators which are involved in many transaction and get fees out of them. For them double-spend would be expensive because they will have to forfeit future profits. But it's a different kind of guarantee, I'd say it's weaker of lots of money is involved, but likely OK for small-scale transactions.
Thus double-spend prevention via miners and double-spend prevention via escrow operators are not fundamentally different: in both cases we rely on 3rd party operators, but we just use different criteria which provide different guarantees. A common pattern is that double-spend should be potentially expensive for operator in some way, so operator is strongly discouraged to do it.
Note that 5 mining pool are responsible more than 50% of bitcoin hashing power, which illustrates that you aren't dealing with some abstract cloud which is totally impartial, your transaction security depends largely on a handful of pool operators.
So what's the difference: use pool operators or use escrow operators?

Ripple as a concept (which existed before 2012) was awesome. Basically it's a way to record debts among friends and settle them. Potentially, it could allow a local economy to flourish without using central bank money.
E.g. imagine a village where people have no money whatsoever. They can, however, record debts, e.g. if Alice sells flour to Bob, they will record that Bob owes Alice 10 dollars. Then Bob sells meat to Claire and now Claire owes him money. Then Clair sells something to Alice etc. In the end they can just settle their debt (like cancel them out) without using any government-issued money.
This was implemented as a simple web site, but it wasn't very popular, so to speak.
In 2012 Ripple, Inc. bought the name with an intention to develop the concept further. But they didn't develop the concept of community settlements, but focused on e-money for some reason. Just to clarify, their technology  could support the original concept, but wallet user interface made it very confusing and hard to use. Also they didn't market it that way. So we can say that Ripple.com killed Ripple-the-concept.
Several years later Ripple's e-money business didn't grow enough, so they decided to market it to banks. Who do not need it even a bit.
So I think Ripple.com/Ripple Inc is both stupid and irrelevant.
As for Ripple-the-concept (also known as [LETS]( it seems fine on paper, but for some reason people don't use it. Possible reasons:
1. implementations which exist now suck
2. nobody is marketing it properly
3. it's hard for people to understand the concept
4. it cannot work because people will try to game the system
5. it's just useless
I think it can be complementary to Bitcoin: ripple could work in networks of people who trust each other, but don't have money; Bitcoin can be used for settlements and for paying people who don't trust you.

No. The difference between exchanges and OTC is that exchanges are transparent and give everyone access to buying and selling.
Selling OTC smells of shoddy deals and corruption. If you sell at exchange, _by definition_ you are selling at the market price. If you sell OTC, you might sell at some arbitrary price. If it's lower than market price, how do you prove you don't pocket the difference?
In case like that, the only legitimate way to sell it is either through public exchanges or through public auction.

Bitcoin's security comes from security of well-understood and pre-existing crypto algorithms like SHA-256, RIPEMD-160 and ECDSA. They were not invented by Satoshi, he just used well-known, existing constructs to develop a protocol.
Protocol is fairly trivial, it can be easily inspected. So it doesn't matter whether it was Satoshi, NSA or North Korea -- it still will work.
If Satoshi said: here's my crypto hash algo, use it, then we'd have all reasons to be suspicious. But SHA-256 is a standard hash.


Of course it is different. MintChip's security comes from security of hardware, not software, and as we know hardware CAN be manipulated if you have right tools.
OTOH security of ECDSA is well beyond computational resources of whole world.

No, Bitcoin doesn't rely on properties of RIPEMD-160 for security. Even if RIPEMD-160 is completely broken, in the sense there is an algorithm for finding collisions (like for MD5), it would have no consequences. You can as well replace RIPEMD-160 with truncating to 160 bits.
It's true, however, that keyspace is reduced to 160 bits.

I support theymos's views on Roger's harmful behaviour.
Reddit is just a place to discuss news. It's not a decision making engine, and it's not a democratic mass media platform.
Sadly, self-moderation (users up/down voting stories and comment) is not effective in cases when somebody is pushing his views with dedication, and is willing to use all available tools such as manipulation, brigading, sock-puppet accounts, etc. Ordinary users cannot thwart well-organized propaganda campaigns.
This is why we have moderators. Reddit gives tools to moderators to combat people who are abusing the system.
This is not perfect, as moderators might be biased and might enforce unreasonable policies. Thus reddit gives users a tool to escape from unreasonable moderators: they can simply start a new subreddit with a different set of moderators. Thus ultimately end users are in control. This can be compared to cryptocurrency hard fork.
I think ideally moderators should just improve signal/noise ratio. E.g. when somebody says something 100 times, they should remove 99 mentions.
Are mods tyrannical? I don't think so. People say they are censoring block size debate, but is where I've read about Gavin Andresen's 20 MB plans, Bitcoin XT, Mike Hearn's decisions to proceed with a hard fork, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, Peter R's paper, and so on.
So it seems that censorship was rather ineffective. But they didn't allow "classic" propaganda to fill the subreddit to the brim.
So anyway, I see it this way: Roger Ver is mad because his propaganda campaign was foiled.

1. It's probably more expensive since not all bytes are usable.
2. Encryption is totally orthogonal to this, bitcoin doesn't help with it. Benefits of using the blockchain are:
 * sender can be anonymous
 * messages are timestamped, so you have an extremely good proof that it existed by certain moment in time.
 * message will be persistent and replicated over thousands of nodes all over internet
 * it's relatively easy for any person to get access to this message
 * it's hard to block it
 * pretty much impossible to delete it
So it might be great for whistleblowers who want their message out and are afraid of government's censorship.
Timestamping might be useful in things like patent application, e.g. you would record a hash of description of your patent in blockchain. That would be a proof that you invented it by the certain date.

People might put up with negative interest rate as long as it is lower than transaction costs: if a negative interest rate is 0.1%, but currency exchange will cost 1% (fees  + spread), then it makes sense to put up with negative interest rate.
But if they push it further so it significantly exceeds transactional costs, then people will have a strong incentive to hold something else.

"Notional value" and "net exposure" are two separate reasons.
Notional value has nothing to do with maximum exposure (maximum damage). Let's say in case of an interest rate swap, if notional value is 1 billion dollars, that doesn't mean that in the worst case scenario 1 billion dollar is exchanged. Only interest on this amount can be exchanged, so if interest cannot exceed 5% then payout cannot exceed  50 million dollars.
You're describing a problem with net exposure in case of counterparty defaults. It can be a major issue, but most likely it will result in financial institutes going bankrupt and waiting for settlement (e.g. with help of courts). It won't result in trillion dollar payouts, though.

A private blockchain is a decentralized database. What it means that there is no single point of failure, and no entity is in control.
If you have a number of independent entities who are unlikely to collude then by using BFT consensus algorithm you can satisfy the requirement above. I.e. history rewrites will be possible only if a certain number of entities will collude.
Bitcoin is similar in this respect: if the majority of miners will collude they can rewrite the chain. This have in fact happened in 2013, miners agreed to abandon a chain after a technical problem was found, and a chain of about 6 blocks was orphaned.
So the statement above shows lack of understanding of how blockchains work.
The only difference between Bitcoin and a private blockchain in this respect is that Bitcoin has open membership.
But this has nothing to do with security, does it?
PoW doesn't make history impossible to rewrite. Miners colluding in 2013 could easily rewrite blocks produced in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 in matter of weeks. (Why 2013 specifically? Hashpower was growing rapidly during this time.)
In fact, private blockchains can offer much better "settlement finality" guarantees: they are likely to use a consensus rule that once a block is signed by a supermajority of validators, it CANNOT be overwritten without a hard fork.

I believe that you need some degree of trust to join any kind of a consensus system (e.g. to join a PoW based system you need to know its rules), so the requirement of "weak subjectivity" doesn't make PoS weaker than PoW.
Not to mention that "weaker" doesn't mean "broken".

Unlikely. Rootstock uses EVM, so it's very similar to Ethereum. Bitcoin uses a different approach: 'smart contracts' are deliberately limited.

If you do not understand something that doesn't make it silly.


1. To avoid abuse where same coins are being sent repeatedly within a short time frame.
2. To make it more fair.
It's crucial to use both coin's amount and age in the metric:
 * if you use only the amount then an attacker can abuse the system by repeatedly sending same high-value coins; also that would exclude people who are sending smaller amounts from using the system altogether

Nope. You can encode messages in addresses of legitimate-looking transactions. You won't be able to spend them, though.
It's trivial to write software which encodes/decodes file into a bunch of bitcoin addresses. It would cost you some money to put it into blockchain, though. Something like 0.01 BTC per one kilobyte.

You see, bitcoin exchanges are not just marketplaces for speculators, but also exchanges for general public. You know, a place where they can buy and sell bitcoins _when_ they need it.
Also Bitcoin is global and one of its selling points is to escape bureaucracy and arbitrary rules. 
So "rest period" makes no sense at all because in many parts of the world it might be a peak of business activity, and halting trading would be really inconvenient, annoying and backwards.
In theory, general public can go to retail exchangers while speculative trading would happen on a separate market which isn't 24/7. But I think it's not going to happen for a number of reasons:
1. People would prefer to do exchange directly on market because they'd have lower spread there. Again, one of major selling points of bitcoins is a lack of middle man.
2. Retail exchangers would like to have access to a liquid market.
3. Since there is a demand for 24/7 market absolutely nothing can stop companies from making one.
So it just isn't going to happen.

By the way, while we are at it:
1. I've built and launched my own futures exchange in May 2011. However it is significantly different as it used some exotic kind of forwards instead of futures to eliminate counter-party risks.
2. I got few alpha users who tried it out, but then closed it because I don't have enough guts to run it.
3. I was in talks with  Fireball, ICBIT main developer, about making futures exchange together. But since I saw traditional futures being too risky and prone to manipulations, I declined and he worked on ICBIT alone. He wanted to make it a big thing, so I don't believe it's a bucket shop.
4. I now work on [colored coins]( and (potentially) decentralized p2p exchanges.
5. I consider making my own derivative trading platform which would be secure and transparent due to use of blockchain-level contracts.
So you can see I'm not very fond of ICBIT, but it's probably the best thing we have now. Do you know something better?

This is why I'm saying that Ethereum HF is a change-of-rules rather than change-of-ledger.

Bitcoin was not designed for microtransactions. It's a system where every full node validates every transaction. Thus transactions are inherently expensive.
Solutions might exist in layers above Bitcoin, such as payment channels.

No. Sending money to a contract will execute [the fallback function]( (in terms of Solidity), which can do nothing, i.e. simply take ethers.
Retrieving ethers can be implemented in a separate function. It's easy to see how to implement MAST:
 * aliceTakesMoney() can check against Alice's contract hash
 * bobTakesMoney() can check against Bob's contract hash
Under the hood it is just one blob of code which dispatches on data it receives in message (possibly null message).


Ethereum computations are stateful. Thus it's not a problem to implement additional processing in a separate step.

But mainstream media attention isn't required for invention development, so what's the point?
Perhaps it had a bigger role back in 1900, as a publication in a major newspaper can greatly increase chances of being noticed by relevant people. (Being noticed by masses is 100% irrelevant before you have an actual product which can be marketed.)
But right now it's a  non-issue, as there are myriads of forums where you can communicate your ideas to like-minded people.
That's how it worked with Bitcoin: Satoshi didn't go to NYT, he posted a message on a crypto mailing list. And it was immediately noticed by relevant people, such as Hal Finney. So Satoshi had absolutely NO problem with communicating to _relevant_ people. 
Next major milestone in terms of publicity is hitting Slashdot (2010). Slashdot isn't NYT, but pretty much all techies who actually could understand Bitcoin at that point got a chance to learn about it. Of course, not everyone is subscribed to Slashdot, but it was widely reposted. I've seen Bitcoin being discussed on a general tech forum which has nothing to do with cryptography or money. People who liked p2p technology (such as BitTorrent) were also cautiously optimistic about Bitcoin.
About a year later, Bitcoin got noticed by mainstream media, such as TIME. 
So I think the article fails to make a point, especially in connection with Bitcoin.

Generally people call it a brainwallet. Text is hashed with SHA-256 to get a raw private key, then you can import that private key into a wallet. Note that wallets expect private key to be encoded in a special way, so you also need to convert raw bytes to that format.
You can use bitaddress.org brainwallet section to get from text to private key. Also you can use [pybitcointools]( or pycoin.
Second hash might be used for verification, e.g: 
    private_key = hash(text)
    verification_hash = hash(private_key)
So you can check that you have the right private_key.
Now the thing is, Bitcoin private keys are 256 bits long, so you can use output of SHA-256 directly. SHA-1 output is only 160 bits. There is no obvious way to use SHA-1 output as a private key. E.g. one can pad it with zeros, or use another round of SHA-256 on top of it... So if it really is SHA-1 then it's a puzzle.

Well, that's only when you have two choices: to memorize or not to memorize.
There is a third choice: memorize one part, write down another. I.e. pick a piece which is really easy to remember so you won't forget it, memorize it. Write down the rest.
OR you can write down a hint which would help you to recover full password.
OR you can write down a part of it in some obscure place.
For example, you can use word frobenizor in all your passwords, then there is simply no way to forget it. Then you add some password-specific parts. Like "frobenizor bitcoin wallet alpha dog marshmallow". So you need to write down only "alpha dog marshmallow" part, e.g. "b.w. alpha dog marshmallow" to note that it's for bitcoin wallet.
Of course it's practically much less entropy than 6 random words, but still it would require considerable effort to crack it with or without a piece of paper.
The idea is to re-distribute entropy between brain and paper storage to mitigate both kind of threats.

to design a practical distributed checkpointing protocol but found it difficult to secure
against network split attack. Although the broadcasted checkpointing mechanism is a
form of centralization, we consider it acceptable before a distributed solution is available.
So, basically, they hope that some not-yet-know magic algorithm can make their blockchain secure. Meanwhile they have to use centralization "to make commerce practical under such a system". Such a joke...

I'm not sure Turing completeness is even relevant when number of steps is limited, that's why I put it in quotes.
I think the main difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum script computation models is statefulness. Bitcoin Script isn't stateful, state updates are performed by a fixed algorithm. But Ethereum explicitly allows user-defined programs to update state.
Ethereum's stateful model has its advantages:
1. It can emulate any other model (although, perhaps, not very efficiently).
2. it is intuitively understood by programmers.
3. It also provides convenient (i.e. easy-to-use) proof-of-publication &amp; communication mechanisms.
So it's sort of a lowest common denominator, and thus is getting popular.
Quite often when people talk about blockchains or smart contracts they actually want proof-of-publication, and Ethereum just lets them have it without thinking much.


This reminds me a Soviet joke: As you might know, "...to each according to his needs" is a popular Socialist slogan. When shops were out of meat products during food shortages, they started displaying signs like "Today people have no need for sausages" because they were not allowed to admit that there is a shortage.
A lot of interesting things could be implemented on top of Bitcoin if it had more powerful/usable smart contract facilities.
E.g. back in 2011 I implemented a Bitcoin-settled derivative trading service. It's something which can be easily implemented in a smart contract -- if smart contract facilities are powerful enough.
As you know, now people use centralized trading services and risk getting goxed.
So how much should we wait until this use case becomes real enough for Bitcoin scripts to be able handle it?
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:44:38
Bitcoin is useful when 
 * you don't trust governments and banks
 * you want to make transactions _they_ don't want you to make
 * as an alternative store of value
It's not useful as a replacement for credit cards. Sorry, bud, but credit cards aren't even money.
It's perfectly fine to just HOLD your bitcoins outside of control of governments if that's something you want to do. This is very much a valid use. (I'd say more valid than paying extra fees...)

Yes. Posts in need to be about Bitcoin. My posts mentions Ethereum many times, but it is actually about Bitcoin: Bitcoin deliberately lacks "Turing-complete" scripting. It's a feature, not a bug. Richer scripts are harder to secure.
Ethereum is simply an example of why so-called "Turing-complete" scripts can be harmful to network's stability.

For market to work, people must be able to **trade** their tokens, i.e. convert Segwit2x to BTC as a vote against Segwit2x. Without replay protection trade is impossible, since it's impossible to reliably split different coins.
You were against replay protection, and thus you were against the market solution. You wanted big miners and "largest wallet" to decide the future of Bitcoin, not users and not the market.

No. As long as not everyone is compromised, you can get 100% uncertainty within mixing pool.
Thus we need mixing to be built-in and automatically enabled in mainstream wallets to have this mixing pool as large as possible.
Imagine an inefficient protocol where mixing is always between two peers, but is done in many rounds. If your counterparty isn't compromised, there's no way for external observer to distinguish between your coins and his coins.
If you repeat it enough times with different peers, eventually your coins will be 100% indistinguishable from coins of other honest peers. So it's definitely possible to achieve arbitrarily good mixing.

If you just want to send and receive money, bitcoind's API is simple enough and it takes no more than a couple of hours to get it working. So not much to learn.

It makes sense. People had BTC, it's fair if they get BTC back. 


The situation is asymmetric -- if BTC price crashed to $1, then they'd get no money at all. So Japanese laws are absolutely unfair in this case:

 * if price goes up, you get less money

Cool story, bro, but HODLing by itself doesn't do anything. 
Imagine if 99% of coins were held by hodlers who don't see no matter what. It's cool, right?
Yeah, except if the remaining 1% dumps their coins, they can drive arbitrarily low, basically to 0. To maintain the price you need DEMAND. HODLers, by definition, do not create demand. You need BUYERs, not HODLers.
The concept of HODLers appeared when bitcoiners tried to cheer themselves up during a crash. HODLers are those who don't sell during the panic.
But now you're somehow conflating HODLers with hoarders who continuously buy bitcoins. It's not the same thing, really.
E.g. suppose someone bought bitcoins 5 years ago and didn't buy or sell anything. Is he a HODLer? By definition, yes. Does he help price recovery after the crash? No, directly, he doesn't. And if others behaved in the same way, price could be arbitrarily low.

You should look at actual features of the system rather than just keywords.
It's basically an exchange for trading Binance-issued tokens using Binance-run nodes.
You cannot exchange, say, Bitcoin for dollars using this exchange. You can only exchange Bitcoin-tokens (issued by Binance) for USD-tokens (also issued by Binance). In the end, you have to trust your funds to Binance.
It won't allow trading cryptos within their own blockchains, i.e. you won't be able to trade BTC to ETH directly. If you want to sell BTC, you first need to convert your real BTC into Binance-BTC-tokens.
While this might have some benefits (e.g. crypto-based authorization and transparency), this is NOT what people typically mean by decentralized exchanges.
Actual decentralized exchanges do not rely on trust. And they already exist -- Bisq, EtherDelta, BitShares.
BitShares is actually very close to what Binance is trying to do -- it works only with tokens on BitShares blockchain. So you cannot trade _real_ BTC on BitShares, you have to use OPEN.BTC which is a token from OpenLedger (an exchange).
We should care about _trustless_ exchanges rather than _decentralized_ exchanges. Decentralization is something which can be trivially faked, and _by itself_ it's not beneficial -- what we really care about are features like high availability, transparency, censorship-resistance.

It's even worse than that, they were basically trying to replace Bitcoin with a fork they control, so he actually tried to kill Bitcoin. In the first version of Bcash they had EDA which was implemented very poorly -- it periodically gives Bcash very low difficulty, so it is crazy profitable to mine it, which starves Bitcoin of the hashrate. At the same time, Bitcoin blocks were full and transaction fees were skyrocketing, and EDA made things even worse.
So I'm pretty sure Bitmain is responsible for both: they intentionally made a poor version of EDA to starve Bitcoin of hashrate and make block times worse, and they spammed Bitcoin network with empty transactions to increase fees and make it unattractive for users. 
This was the main talking point of Bcash, so it would be surprising if this is something which happens on its own (and doesn't happen now, BTW) and not a part of the plan.

Memory errors such as dereferencing object which is already dead, memory corruption and buffer overruns are _impossible_ in safe languages, e.g. Java, Haskell, ML and so on, in normal circumstances. That is, unless you specifically enable unsafe mode (which is very rarely needed, if at all), it's impossible to do a memory corruption. 
Memory leaks are a non-issue from security standpoint. But  garbage-collected language e.g. Java, Haskell and ML prevent them in almost all circumstances.

This is 10x worse than heartbleed, since heartbleed only leaked memory in a random way, while this gives arbitrary code execution. It's as bad as it gets. Attacker retrieve data in convenient way, or go further and attack other systems in the network.

Typically all shipped software has bugs. But quality and quantity of those bugs depend on many factors.


Bugs such as memory corruption and buffer overruns can only happen in unsafe code.


Depends on application.


It fundamentally cannot have things like remote code execution via buffer overflow.


Look, I couldn't care less about code you write. Maybe it's perfect. But all software released so far HAS bugs, and software written in C typically has really nasty memory corruption bugs, which often lead to arbitrary code execution.
So we have thousands of programs which are known to have nasty bugs, and we have one dude who claims his code is "good". Either you're the best programmer in the world, or you're just not aware of problems with your code.


I'm saying that when one uses safe languages he doesn't have to deal with memory corruption and arbitrary code execution errors.


But at that point the application already _was_ vulnerable. If you were coding in a better language, that problem can be prevented -- typically compiler will tell you you're doing something wrong.
I.e. you'd fix the bug after bitcoins are stolen, dude coding in a safe language would prevent bitcoins being stolen.
A responsible thing is to PREVENT problems from happening, and doing that requires tooling which can prevent the most critical type of errors. Such as automatic memory management and type system, for example.

You are lying. All non-trivial software in C had memory errors. 
Linux kernel, curl, Apache, nginx, you name it. This is not fine.
My favorite so far is this: 
"Finding a bug was the easy part. " If you have software written in C, it's pretty much guaranteed to have bugs, many of them exploitable.
Do you have a smartphone? Most likely it has firmware in C which is exploitable from remote.
This is NOT fine. At all.


And that reason is that people are lazy and do not want to learn new stuff.
Having your hardware and software is "fine" to these people.
There's no language which can prevent 100% of errors. However, many modern languages can prevent these errors from being exploitable. If there's a bug in program, it should crash. It shouldn't corrupt memory, perform arbitrary commands etc.
If you don't think C is "terrible or wrong" you should do more research.

No, we also need to worry about forks. A miner might attack Bitcoin to promote an alt-coin. This can be done together with disinformation attack. You know, having billions in the pocket you can buy all the media.
We need to worry about Evil State Actors too. China doesn't need to build billions worth of mining hardware to attack Bitcoin. All they need is to "convince" Bitmain to cooperate. So they can say that e.g. Bitcoin is a coin used for unlawful activity and will be banned, while Bcash will be officially recognized. AliExpress will accept Bcash. Most investors will go with officially endorsed coin.
They don't even need to do anything disruptive to do this kind of attack. They can just force all miners within the China to honor some sort of a blacklist. Now if miners outside of China mine a block which doesn't honor the blacklist, their block will be orphaned. So they have an incentive to honor the blacklist too. This can be brought together with an announcement that Bitcoin is officially recognized as a currency, is tax free and can be used on AliExpress and other online stores. Most investors might even consider this a positive development.

It is different. 
On a very basic level, if you fund extra spending with extra taxes, you have negative effects now, but positive effects later.
If you 'print money' to fund spending, you get positive effects now, and negative effects later (if any).
This means that tax increases cannot be used to prop up economy, but monetary base inflation can. If you increase taxes you will harm economy before it has any chances to improve. But if you inject fresh money you can get higher level of economic activity, and this larger economy can absorb that extra money. Or if you have problem with inflation you can remove extra money from circulation and booming economy won't be hurt.


Printing coins =/= inflation. Inflation is defined by price increase.
According to quantity theory of money, on a basic level prices are affected by:
 * velocity of money
 * quantity of goods exchanged
 * money supply
Printing coins increases monetary base, but money supply is affected only indirectly. So there is a couple of levels of indirection and delayed effects between 'printing coins' and inflation. Other variables change all the time, so there is no reason to keep monetary base stable.
There is an inflation game from ECB:  You should try it, it's fairly good at demonstrating the concept. You can call it Keynsian propaganda, but note that ECB itself was really good at following 2% inflation target, so maybe you should listen to them.


I fail to see what's less fair about it: as you said, it affects _everybody_ _equally_, while taxation -- not so much. Why equal treatment is worse than non-equal?
However, note that inflation affects only money in your pocket, which usually isn't a sum large enough to bother. People usually have serious amounts of money invested into some assets.
It also affects salaries, but it's up to you to negotiate it being inflation-indexed. If you can't that just means that your company is going to pay you less with time.
In theory, in an economy with stable inflation it barely affects anybody as they can structure their contracts to take it into account. Only rapid inflation rise is problematic.


Even if there is no difference for your pocket, there is a difference for economy. Try reading something about macroeconomics, maybe just wikipedia for the start.


Can you elaborate on how exactly it hurts people? I live in a country with high inflation, 20+% some years. and I really see no problem. Salaries grow faster than inflation. And people who have money convert it to USD/gold/stocks etc.


It is small economy for a reason: GLBSE gives you no guarantees, you cannot even know who issued bond and how to get money back. OTOH if banks lends money to business and business becomes bankrupt, banks will get some money back out of liquidation of that business. Or it can get in possession of that business.
There is a huge infrastructure which supports law enforcement and regulatory structures, and you simply cannot get it without government. Without this stuff it's just a gamble.
This is a reason why banks lend huge amounts of money on daily basis but bonds on GLBSE are fairly rare and exotic.


People who buy bonds on GLBSE are, basically, same people who play Satoshi Dice and participate in high-yield investment schemes-- bond issuer might take your money and give nothing in return. It's not comparable to real bond market.
I think, realistically, bitcoin is just a low-friction payment system: one can receive and send bitcoins bypassing all government regulations, and thus it might help to boost business activity under bureaucratic, oppressive governments. But it cannot help failing economy in general.
LETS/Ripple can, in theory.

It is crucial to a cryptocurrency which might be available to everyone in the world and should be secure to state-level attacks.
But, guess what, there are other purposes and goals.


Wrong. If a private blockchain is created by multiple independent entities, they can set up in such a way that a supermajority is required to change member list. (In fact, that's the only setup which makes sense.) Thus no single entity is in control. There is no additional security risk: if a supermajority is able to add new members, it is also able to rewrite the chain.

Satoshi took inspiration from a concept called [linked timestamping]( This is essentially where blockchain data structure comes from.
Proof-of-work makes linked timestamping fully automated, and with a token the system works on its own.
But that's not the only way of doing linked timestamping. You can get most security benefits without a token.

OK. _Ledger_ is a history of transactions.
"The immutability of the ledger" means that historic records (transactions) cannot be changed or reordered.
@_date: 2016-09-17 09:21:47


Actually it's the opposite. Fees were largely irrelevant at early stages when miners are enthusiasts who are going to include transactions into blocks just because that's how it's supposed to work.
But Bitcoin is getting increasingly commercial, miners now worry about their profits. Bigger blocks increase their orphan rate, so they are interested in including as few transactions as possible.
So, basically, without fees miners have no incentive to include transactions. This is a tragedy of commons/prisoners' dilemma kind of a situation.
Another problem is that block subsidy will eventually go down to zero, and with no revenues miners will just have no incentive to mine blocks.
In principle, it's possible to design a cryptocurrency with no fees and permanent subsidy, while also adding an incentive to include transactions. E.g. block reward might be proportional to logarithm of bitcoin-days-destroyed of included transactions.
The problem is that a lot of people have a problem with permanently growing money supply. If bounded block rewards result in asymptotically zero inflation, but few people really understand that.


If we had block reward incentives instead of fees then yes, I guess, it's more flexible. The thing is, you can always introduce fees if necessary, but introducing block reward incentives is politically impossible.
If we had neither fees nor other incentives then Bitcoin would be fucked.

Some amount of trust is _always_ necessary. You aren't born with definition of Bitcoin in your brain, you need to find a piece of software which is called Bitcoin.
Finding currently used PoS chain is just as easy as finding what version of Bitcoin is the current one. It is trivial. So there's no difference between pure PoS and pure PoW w.r.t. trust, there's only intellectually dishonest people which put Bitcoin's trust requirements out of consideration for no reason.


OK can you show my one argument why PoW is decentralized?
And if it's not decentralized, do you think it can be secure? Attacker who owns &gt;50% of hashpower can do a number of attacks at no cost.


It doesn't work this way. If you claim that Bitcoin is secure, you need to prove that it tends to be decentralized, and you can't do that.

Obviously nobody can give you a guarantee that it's unbreakable. In fact, it's not proven it cannot be cracked with today technology.


Wrong. Address is actually a 160-bit number. There are several textual representations of that address.
The one you are talking about it base58check. It uses an alphabet of 58 characters and adds some meta-data to address.


Wrong. It should be 64^35, not 25^64. 64 is alphabet size, 35 is number of characters. If you have one character there are 64 possibilities, if you have two there are 64*64 possibilities, if you have 35 you have 64^35 possibilities. 
64^35 is about 1.6 * 10^63. Since some characters are impossible, it's actually 58^35 = 5*10^61.


On blockchain level addresses are 160-bit numbers. It doesn't give a flying fuck about alphanumeric characters. So in reality there are 2^160 = 1.46 * 10^48.
The difference is checksum and metadata. You're essentially suggesting trying to guess 4 billion checksum numbers for each address instead of just computing it.
Blockchain.info actually lists hex representation. E.g. 
It shows Hash 160	178a70830425e51e815369d0407cf2b6e5066e45

Well, that's your problem. "Current exchange rate" doesn't exist on its own, it is merely a manifestation of supply and demand forces which exist on market.
E.g. if there are people who want to buy up to 1000 bitcoins total at 13.20 and there are people who want to sell up to 1000 bitcoins at 13.40 we can say that "current exchange rate" is approximately 13.30.
But it is simply an abstraction. If you want to buy Bitcoins right now, you'll have to pay 13.40 for each, or perhaps even more if you want to buy lots of bitcoins.
Say, if you want to buy 50000 BTC right now they will cost you at least 15 USD each.
Obviously people who run an exchange know it, they won't allow people to buy large quantities of coins at some abstract "current exchange rate", they will go to market and charge you  a market rate.
And obviously exchange rate will skyrocket if a lot of people convert their salaries into bitcoins. We'll never run out of bitcoins, but they can cost like 100 USD per 1 BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:31:42
True. But the fact that a lot of bitcoins sit in addresses which are vulnerable implies that this problem needs to be solved globally, not on a wallet level.

Usually the problem with voting is coercion, i.e. an entity which is in power might force people who depend on it to vote in a particular way. Another concern is vote buying, which is more-or-less the same thing.
You can see this all the time in corrupt countries, e.g. ex-USSR countries: even if counting is honest, people might be forced to vote in a particular way. For example, government workers might be forced to vote for pro-government candidate, otherwise they get fired.
So what you want in a voting system is a high degree of privacy and plausible deniability. Ideally, it should be possible for someone to verify his vote was counted, but he should NOT be able to prove that he voted in a particular way. (Otherwise the coercing entity will require voters to give him proofs.)
This requires use of complex, unusual cryptographic constructs. There are decades of research on that kind of stuff.
If you want an open vote, then sure, it's quite easy: The authority can generate certificates for voters, who then record their votes in a tamper-proof way, such as block chain.
Another problem is that it is hard to verify a highly technical solution, but perhaps blockchain is simple enough for that. (Now those fancy anonymous voting systems are extremely hard to verify.)

I'm well aware of hundreds of projects which aim to do this. In fact I've been involved in one, and was consulting a couple.
People often confuse public key cryptography with blockchains. Public key cryptography gives you 95% of benefit, blockchain gives you 5%.
Basically, blockchain serves a role of cargo cult here. People believe that if it's on blockchain, it's secure. Techies agree that it's _more_ secure, because blockchain can mitigate certain threats.
Why techies are fine with this is because most "traditional" identity solutions are horribly designed and implemented, with design-by-committee and compat with old retarded bullshit. Blockchain is just a good premise to start over from scratch.
But the problem is, there are hundreds of these initiatives, so they will produce a lot of incompatible stuff.
Especially IOTA with its belorussian "genius" who loves hand-rolled cryptography and ternary systems. Sadly, these guys have billions dollars to bribe people, and I pity programmers who are going to support this crap.

Well, I just wanted to point out that SegWit is necessary only if you use a Bitcoin derivative. On other blockchains things are different.
SegWit is a huge accomplishment only in context of Bitcoin. I.e. the fact that it was done as a soft fork. If I make my own blockchain, SegWit analog is ~10 lines of trivial code. (I know because I done exactly that.)

Normally a private blockchain is in control of multiple entities, so a better term is "federated blockchain". I.e. multiple banks can unite to keep a common database. This use case is not normally addressed by distributed databases.

 * low liquidity
 * slow execution
 * high fees
So, naturally, people prefer centralized exchanges.
Situation might change when we get better decentralized exchange tech. E.g., in theory, you can do all exchanges in payment channels, not unlike LN. But we are quite far from that.
JFYI Bitcoin isn't the only game in the town. BitShares decentralized exchange (which is built into BitShares blockchain) functions quite well -- you get execute trade within 3 seconds, there's order book, liquidity, etc. There are even dollars within the system.
Ethereum decentralized exchanges, such as [EtherDelta]( are actually quite popular.

Your definition of _decentralized_ is not acceptable to me. You're describing an ideal PoW-based system, which rules out other possibilities.
I define decentralized as "lacking a center". For example, definition from dictionary: "decentralized: v. transfer (authority) from central to local government." It doesn't say that everyone and his cat should be participating.


I don't know what you're referring to, but I generally disagree with a notion that PoS (or DPoS) is inherently inferior to PoW. It is possible that PoW will converge to a single monopolist, and it is possible that PoS will work flawlessly, resisting corruption, etc.
@_date: 2016-09-14 23:55:55
Whether BitShares confirmations are weaker than Bitcoin confirmations depend on what model you use. 
PoW is physically different from PoS: PoW attacks require _some_ energy expenditures, while PoS attack require negligible amount of energy. So PoW is, like, infinitely better in this respect!
But we need to compare them in terms of security, not physics, right? We can only do this comparison within a particular economic model.
You say that PoS can be attacked at minimum, zero cost. But the whole point of _stake_ is that it makes history mutations costly.
It's possible to describe scenarios in which an attack will carry zero cost, but that's also true for PoW. E.g.
1. Suppose there are 4 miners each having 25% of total hashpower: A, B, C, D. Suppose A mined last three blocks, so blockchain's tail looks like ...BAAA, for example. Suppose B, C and D decided to collude against A for some reason, so they can just orphan his blocks and mine on top of latest non-A block, so a blockchain might look like ...BCDB. A's blocks are orphaned and transactions contained in them might be double-spend. What's the cost of this attack? It looks like 0 to me.
2. Attacker hijacks nodes of the majority of mining pools and mines blocks to do a reorg. If this attack will remain unnoticed for one hour he might reorg a 6-block chain. This attack is costless for the attacker as owners of mining facilities will be paying for electricity.
3. If attacker can obtain 51+% of total hashpower the attack becomes costless as collected block rewards will cover electricity costs.
These are obscure scenarios, sure, but they are theoretically possible, right?
In more practical scenarios an attack will carry some costs, but that's also true for PoS: the attacker will need either to bribe stakeholders or purchase the stake himself. These costs are likely much higher than a cost of running Bitcoin mining for a couple of hours, so I don't see any reason to emphasize electricity costs.


I'm not tracking latest developments, but previously they were talking about some sort of cementing to prevent long-range attacks. I.e. nodes won't accept a reorganization which is too deep without a HF.

There are two possible cases:
1. Simulation is governed by fundamental laws which are uniform and do not change. In this case it is indistinguishable from "reality"... And thus it shouldn't bother us, as it cannot affect us in any way by definition.
2. Simulation laws can be violated or change over time. These violations/changes can be potentially detected, thus it is possible to formulate falsifiable theories.

This site is made by cypherpunks, i.e. people who advocate use of strong cryptography.
It is not pretty, it is hard to use, but it's immune to wide spectrum of attacks.
For example, you can have your private key on an offline computer and move only signed messages to perform trade. If you do it this way, nobody would be able to steal your assets. As people can potentially own assets worth millions of USD it sort of makes sense.
On the other hand, if exchange is browser-based, there is a high risk of getting hijacked.

This is a superstition. It's perfectly fine to reuse address in this case.
In fact Maxwell now regrets spreading "reusing addresses weakens security" meme (see Bitcoin dev mailing list). The fact is that that many addresses are reused (including addresses which hold large amounts of bitcoins), so for all intents and purposes, Bitcoin _depends_ on ECDSA for security.
The only reason to avoid address reuse is privacy (and in case of merchants, proper accounting).

This is just an example. Please give your definition of Bitcoin.


I consider how it looks like for a person who has no pre-existing knowledge. He will have to do research. How would he know Roger Ver is a conman? He'd need to read newspapers (many of them are pro-Ver, BTW), forums, etc. This **is** weak subjectivity.
Researching which client is a legit one is not different from researching which chain is legit one. So Bitcoin weak subjectivity is not different from PoS weak subjectivity. Both require research.
Are you capable of abstract thinking? Imagine how it looks like from a point of view of users who doesn't know what you know, i.e. that Wright and Ver are scammers.
If there's a possibility for a person to learn that Wright is a scammer and thus his client is wrong, then there's also a possibility to learn that chain X is a scam chain and chain Y is a legit one.
I use names like Ver just for illustration. If you have problems with abstract thinking, it might be easier in this form:
Consider a PoWcoin. There is chain X endorsed by person PX and chain Y endorsed by person PY. How would user know which one is legit?
What's different is we consider a PoScoin?

Wrong. Bitcoin security strength is not 256 bits.
It is ~160 bits if you are looking at address collision -- i.e. iterate through all privkeys, found one which has same hash.
And 128 bits if public key is known -- there are some sophisticated attacks which reduce ECDSA strength from 256 to 128 bits.
See [here](


For DSA it's even worse: you need 1024 bit key to get 80 bits of security.
@_date: 2018-02-25 10:27:21


When we consider security, we always assume the worst. Because you don't want to rely on guesswork -- "OK, maybe it's not so bad" isn't a solid basis for $200 billion ecosystem. So if there's a possibility that one person has that, we should assume it.


The problem is much more fundamental: PoW lacks decentralizing forces, and has centralizing forces. 


It is certainly profitable, but you need to consider the alternatives.
First, a switch to Bcash or other alt-coin might be much more profitable. Instead of 1 billion they can make 10 billion. They mined fuckton of Bcash via EDA, so it's a very real possibility that flip to Bcash will be much more profitable for them.
Second, if you are person like Jihan Wu, you might be no longer motivated by money. I.e. imagine earning one billion dollars or two billion dollars. Does it make any difference? No. Everything you ever want to purchase can be purchased with one billion. People like that might want other stuff, like power. Going into a history as a person who replaced Bitcoin with his own altcoin is certainly more entertaining than being one of thousands of billionaires. He might even genuinely believe that Bcash is a better path forward and he gives humanity a favor.
Third, as I mentioned, state-level actors might have different reasoning. Billions in profit is insignificant to them, they can literally print money. What they care about is control. Getting control of the biggest cryptocurrency is a very lucrative target.


Hmm, what? The fact that they own majority of hashpower is a very thinly veiled fact. They aren't even trying to hide that. There's a bunch of pools which are known to be affiliated with Bitmain. They also make &gt;70% of all ASICs.
They of course would say: "We funded VIA BTC but they are operating independently, we pinky promise", but can you find a fool believing that?
There's way too much wishful thinking in Bitmain hardware is also known to have a killswitch. So we know that 70% of all hardware is compromised, but somehow that haven't "threatened the trust in Bitcoin".
People don't give a flying fuck, really. They are going to believe any fairy tale as long as it suits them. Crypto investors now invest into Ripple which is 100% centralized and US-based.


They are probably more interested in controlling it. E.g. getting ability to block certain transactions. Or requiring some form of licensing. This is very much doable via 'soft fork' or even 'feather fork', read about it.
They aren't exactly stupid. Best chance is to make it 99.9% Bitcoin except one single thing, and modify it over time.
Many in Bitcoin community are complacent. E.g. Mike Hearn, who was considered as one of Bitcoin thought leaders, proposed blacklisting, [see here]( And the community didn't shun him right away, he even got some traction with his XT revolt.
So if China says "Bitcoin will be 100% legal currency in China! But there's one thing..." many will applaud to this.
Now getting in control of Bitcoin is hugely useful. E.g. imagine Bitcoin becoming world's reserve currency. Countries and banks will get it into their reserves. And China might be able to control it through soft-forks. If some country pisses it off, they'll just freeze its bitcoins.
Again, if we are talking about security, it's enough to find one bad and plausible scenario. We don't need to know what exactly China will do, the fact is is they can pull something like this off, and they have motivation.
I would be very surprised if they aren't considering something like that. They don't need to do this right away, they just need to keep dominating Bitcoin mining until Bitcoin becomes powerful enough to be used for national reserves, at which point China might actually get interested in getting tighter control. People say China holds US by balls via US treasury bonds (China owns trillions and can flood the market), they can do the same with Bitcoin.

Well, it's true, actually... What people call "blockchain technology" is, basically, a combination of linked timestamping with consensus algorithms. Both existed before Bitcoin, but weren't considered very interesting from business perspective.
Bitcoin showed people how applied cryptography can change business. So older tech was relabeled as blockchain tech.
Perhaps the best example is GuardTime -- the company has been working since 2008 and its product is linked timestamping. Now they claim they do "blockchain technology", because it sounds way more cool.

Honestly this wallets look like an amateur work to me. They are kinda  good amateurs, although I still have concerns.
You know, that, "ricochet" feature just sends coins through 7 hops without any attempts to mix it. Obviously, it's easy to find the sender by just tracing 7 hops.
So what is this? Just an amateurish mis-feature, or their intentionally give people false sense of security? I'm leaning towards the former, because...
If you have right tools, it takes only a couple of days to implement semi-decent mixer (CoinJoin style, for example), which actually helps to preserve privacy.
If they were truly compromised, they would have released good-looking mixer which is subtly broken and bleeds privacy.
People who have something to hide can probably see that ricochet is pure bullshit.
Samourai wallet has cool branding and PR and they were able to make a working wallet which is cool.
Now it would be cool if they learned how to implement actual privacy features.

No, you need to trust that particular code base has data (genesis block, bootstrap nodes...) and algorithms (consensus rules) which correspond to what is recognized as Bitcoin on most exchanges. This is very subtle and many people dismissed this assumption altogether until the forkening.
You can see this subtlety in BitFinex chain split contracts: to implement these contracts they needed to define what is "Bitcoin" and what is Bitcoin in future. [See here](


So what we see here is that it's impossible to describe what is Bitcoin without referencing a particular location. This **is** weak subjectivity. So if e.g. Gavin Andresen would have restored as bitcoin/bitcoin committer by github staff and booted other devs and added e.g. a soft fork, people might argue that Gavin-chain would be the "Incumbent Blockchain" by Bitfinex definition. So Github Inc can affect definition of Bitcoin.
**All** cryptocurrencies rely on weak subjectivity, but PoW zealots refuse to recognize it. When I discussed this previously people mentioned that it's not necessary to know all consensus rules and one can just follow the SHA-256^2 chain with most work. OK, good. Now when Bitcoin Unlimited people started parroting same argument, somehow it was no longer valid.


We do not need to add anything because it is already the case. According to Roger Ver, real Bitcoin is here:  not here:  According to, say, Greg Maxwell, the opposite is true. I need to know which expert to trust to choose the right Bitcoin.
But I don't really need to take Maxwell's word for it. I can check what is recognized as Bitcoin by top exchanges like Coinbase, Bitstamp, Bitfinex etc. So what weak subjectivity means in practice is that you need to do a bit of research before you start using a coin.
People in forget this because they did this research and forgot about it. But when new people join, they need to do this research. And we had some reports about people who bought BCH thinking they bought Bitcoin, no?
This is more pronounced with alt-coins where it's often not obvious which of several sites is official and which is the scam.


The problem is that instead of considering practical security threats which might actually affect end users, you go into some weird philosophy shit like adding 32 bytes to executable will make everything oh-so-untrustless.
There are very real security concerns which are swept under rug. Bitcoin is extremely vulnerable to eclipse attacks (i.e. network-level attacks on nodes). PoW+PoS makes these attacks pretty much impossible. But this trade-off isn't even considered because it goes against PoW religion.
Note that PoW+PoS doesn't have any of typical PoS problems and doesn't require "weak subjectivity" thing, so it doesn't even infringe on your religion in practice, but you seem to find everything about PoS abhorrent, it seems. 


Nothing is superficial in what I described, there are very serious practical concerns, unlike the "weak subjectivity" scare.


I do not care about abstract concepts such as trustiness. The question is whether we can eliminate practical threats without creating new ones, and the answer is yes.


How so? I read Poelstra's work and I'm not impressed. I think we discussed it before? Some of his concerns were addressed in new PoS algorithms. Other concerns are very contrived and not realistic at all. [My PoS paper]( was written after Poelstra/Maxwell and takes their considerations into account. You can in fact see it referenced:


I know Iddo Bentov was communicating with  and they found our reasoning more-or-less adequate.
As for Sztorc's, well, it's some kind of a weird drivel which uses odd metaphors and goes over the place. I'm not really interested in reading this shit trying to find bits of sense in it. And who is Sztorc, anyway? I was a co-author of two academic articles about cryptocurrency consensus. And Sztorc's accomplishment is what, exactly? Some failed prediction market proposal?


Sztorc claims like 50 different things, do I need to address them all?
I had discussion before, and it seems like we just start from different assumptions. My assumptions are rooted in practical security concerns. Bitcoin fanbois make assumptions which make Bitcoin good and everything else bad. Until we normalize the assumptions there's no point in this discussion.

Well, suppose you do not trust banks, so you bought a bunch of gold. At some point you need to make a purchase, so you sell your gold, get USD and buy good with it.
Yes, it's possible that gold price goes up immediately after you sell it. Shit happens. It might also go down.
I live in Ukraine and we do not trust our local currency over here (UAH), so we have savings in USD usually. So sometimes you sell USD but price goes up. It's very easy to get used to the fact that prices fluctuate. There are hundreds of millions of people around the world who are used to this kind of mechanic.
Can Bitcoin be used for payments directly? Yes. Usually merchant has a set up where he instantly sells bitcoins he receives. This can be done via Coinbase and BitPay, for example. End user is exposed to fluctuations, but it's his choice.
Perhaps Bitcoin will be more stable in future. Now it's kinda isolated from normal FX trading infrastructure, so volumes are kinda low and volatility is high.
Maybe in future we'll have hedging smart contracts which help people to deal with volatility. So it's not a huge issue in the long term.
Perhaps FX traders who want to boost their profits/losses will prefer more volatility, and normal users will prefer less volatility. It can be implemented in a trustless way via smart contract.

OK, so consider a situation when there's a business downturn.
So there is reduced demand for goods and services. A lot of people are fired from their jobs and become unemployed, simply because there's no demand for what they are doing.
This means that people also has less money to spend, so this further reduces demand.
Government's income is also reduced. So if it's unable to print or borrow money, it has to fire people.
But you already have a lot of unemployed people in the country, and now former government workers are competing for the shrinking number of vacancies.
So this adds insult to injury. 
On top of that, government will have problem funding social policies, like feeding unemployed people.
And if government tries to tax harder, it will make things even worse.

Currently mostly Bitcoin **owners**. People who hold coins accept the dilution.
Those people can also decide which fork wins: e.g. if they do not want S2X coins, they dump it, price will crash, and miners will flock back to the original chain.
People who are buying bitcoins also are paying to run the network. But decision to buy bitcoins has same effect as decision not to sell them, so it's kinda the same.
Fees are only something like 1-5% of miners' revenue, so not at all that significant. PoW is financed mostly through dilution.

Well, for starters, instead of putting code on github like normal people do, they have "view code" button on their web site, which opens files (with hidden file names, by the way) for viewing in tiny-tiny code. This is, basically, a huge "fuck you!" to anybody trying to review it.

They are unnecessary. All necessary logic can be implemented within the contract.
E.g. see [here](
     function claim(uint channel, address recipient, uint value, 
               uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)
First signature is processed by Ethereum transaction logic, second signature is (v, r, s) tuple which can be verified like this:
      owner == ecrecover(sha3(channel, recipient, value),  v, r, s);
I'm not sure what you mean by "reliable". If implemented correctly, this is guaranteed to work. It might be somewhat non-obvious for people who are new to Ethereum, but if you spend several days learning you'll figure it out.
Similar approach is used in EtherDelta trustless exchange. It have been used for more than a year for millions of trades.

OK, so you need extra steps and extra configuration. Can you remind me why do you think it's easier than untar and run? It's really not.

You cannot patent an equation, but you can patent "a machine which uses an equation to accomplish X". So quite likely Craig Wright can patent it, I suspect he can patent this even if pairings for secp256k1 are impractical.

That works only within simple models which take into account only short-term effects. You assume that Satoshi was some sort of a genius game theorist, but he really wasn't, he didn't mention game theory even once. He was talking about "honest nodes" (read the Bitcoin paper, really).
It is true that within simple models Bitcoin is protected by game theoretic effects.
It is not true that this result stays the same in more complex models which take into account e.g. competing forks.


That's the problem: you are a fan who believes that Bitcoin was designed by some higher entity to withstand all kinds of attacks.
But it really wasn't. Satoshi was using just his intuition, his reasoning is not rigorous.
You aren't basing your confusions on results on serious research, you are basing them on blind faith.
In reality Bitcoin has many game-theoretic problems. For example, in 2013 Andrew Miller [described feather forks](


Is anybody talking about "removing selfish motivation"? That's a nice strawman, mate.
Worth noting that "selfish motivation" works only within theoretic models. If you have a large number of different groups then on average they are probably driven by "selfish motivation".
But if you consider just one entity (BITMAIN/Jihan Wu), you don't know what motivates him. One entity is too unpredictable to reason about using broad theoretical methods. 
Cobra is proposing PoW+PoS hybrid. That keeps "selfish motivation" in place, but spreads it over a large number of entities.

Yes, it is called 'thin client'. (Or, sometimes, lightweight client.) It offers somewhat different security model, although for some things that's enough.
@_date: 2012-10-06 18:28:13


Please note that that patch was a very basic proof-of-concept. We are currently working on patches to Armory which will be the real thing. (More or less so.)


Client software will have a dialog for this. 
Physically, you send some small sum of bitcoins to your own address, then client software will create a "color definition" out of it. Basically, it will just record transaction hash, output index and a label you associate with this color, e.g. "My USD coins". Client keeps coins of different colors in separate wallets or "sub-wallets", so you won't be able to send these colored coins to simple "uncolored" bitcoin address.
Once you've created a color definition you need to share it with other people who might want to recognize this color. E.g. they will import this definition into their client software. (Perhaps it can be done via some web service.)
Let's say some guy imported your "My USD coins" color definition and he want to sell you something for these "USD coins". He will get a special "colored address" from his client. It will encode same information as a regular address (public key hash), but will also include color label.
When you'll try to send coins to this address your client will recognize color label and send coins which are marked as "My USD coins" according to color definition.
We track color of coins (i.e. whether they carry any color label) via a special algorithm: 


The way I see it, order books will be maintained by order-book-providers. Order book provider is a very simple web service, it doesn't need to be secure since it stores no money, and anybody can run it. Think like people run mining pools, but simpler.
In client software you can choose one or more such order book providers.
Orders are submitted into order book provider's web feed. Think like IRC channel buy HTTP-based.
Order includes information about what we want to exchange (e.g. 1 USDcoin for 0.1 BTC), proof that submitter has coins he wants to exchange, and "contact information", which is just an URL of a private channel.
These orders will be received and displayed in client software of other users, and when user will choose to accept such offer, his client will communicate with counterparty. (Essentially it will just POST data to URL specified in order.)
Trade is complete when both parties will sign a transaction which will exchange their coins. Such transaction is atomic, so there is no way to lose your money without getting something back. Hence it is called [atomic coin swap](
Jeff Garzik and Mike Hearn, however, have different views on networking level, they want something like distributed hash table.
I believe that HTTP is better because it is easier to implement and it scales from fully centralized to fully p2p solutions...
But it doesn't matter much how network level is organized, people as well can use email, IRC and forums for it. It only affects convenience and how fast trade is done.

Why do you consider PoS more controversial? 
It's clear that PoW sucks: it has many centralizing forces and very few decentralizing forces, thus PoW naturally moves towards centralizing. A PoW blockchain can be decentralized only through sheer lack.
So pretty much anything would be an improvement against pure PoW.
On the other hand, I haven't seen any strong arguments against PoS, only some minor undesirable points, especially if it's combined with PoW.
I think politically it would be simpler to switch to PoW+PoS hybrid which is compatible with existing mining hardware: this way we can avoid disruption while protecting against possible issues with miners.

In all three cases you have an unregulated, unaudited entity holding your fiat money for you.
MtGox also, presumably, kept fiat money in a bank.


In reality they just sell your bitcoins and keep fiat. If they don't, you just have an additional risk, that whatever mechanism they're using will fail.
As for competence, Coinapult recently lost the contents of their hot wallet, so how do you know it is better than MtGox? MtGox also looked sort of reputable, biggest exchange and everything. And it wasn't just an exchange, they had merchant solutions at some point.
It is utterly fucking stupid to trust your money to a middleman when you can just have them in a bank. You just increase your risk this way, as in the end these middlemen have to keep money in a bank anyway. So it can't be more secure than having money in a bank, but it can be less secure, as was evidently demonstrated many times.

Bitcoin uses concentrated PoW which is easy to verify. You can verify Bitcoin PoW on very constrained device. It also aims to make PoW as stable as possible.
IOTA spreads PoW throughout many transactions. It's not longer easy to verify, i.e. you need to download a shitload of data to verify PoW. Also IOTA PoW depends on payment activity and is not stable.
I'd say the very concept makes no sense. It's not even clear what problem they were trying to solve.

"White paper" is just an intro. It's not a complete specification and it's not a big Bible. There are many things in Bitcoin 0.1 which are not mentioned in the white paper. For example, scripting, transaction replacement, time locking.

"Physical bitcoins" do exist, in some sense. They aren't really bitcoins, they are just wallet access codes which are printed on a physical coin.
People did that in early years (2011-2012), I guess they wanted to make Bitcoin feel more tangible. Usually access code is protected by tamper-evident sticker, so a receiving party can see that coin is loaded. Obviously, it has to trust the mint.
It might work fine if the value you transfer is like $10, then maybe you just trust the issue. Obviously, makes no sense to do that with &gt;$1000 coins.
So the thing is, coins which were made in early years are quite rare (depending on a particular issue), and thus collectors value them _above_ their Bitcoin value.
While they do exist, most likely you have just a souvenir coin which has no connection to Bitcoin aside from a currency symbol.
If you want something to drool on, there are [1000 BTC Casascius bitcoins]( worth about 4 million dollars at current price.

OK, let's say 100 banks decide to make a new settlement system inspired by Bitcoin. To do that, they take Bitcoin source code and
1. modify transaction structure
2. remove PoW block validity check
3. add a check that block is considered valid when it is signed by 60 out of 100 pre-defined keys (which belong to these banks)
It looks like you already agreed that it is a blockchain. So banks can use the blockchain technology this way. But why?
One major advantage over "conventional databases" is that the system can keep working even if 40 bank nodes are down or were hijacked.
You can't do that with using Oracle DBMS, can you? Some DMBSs offer multi-master replication, but they can't deal with Byzantine failures as they don't have a thorough cryptographic verification. (SSL is not enough.)
What else? They can offer some advanced features like conditional transfers and fully automated escrow at no extra cost.
Why? You can certainly implement all kinds of advanced features on top of conventional databases, but then you need to deal with race conditions. Which is kinda hard in a distributed environment (i.e. each bank has its own database).

It's not really about nodes, the question is on what side the economic majority is. People would like to have coins which can be spent using BitPay and Coinbase, which can be sold on BitStamp. In theory it is possible that a fork will be successful if both miners and big exchanges support it, even if the majority of nodes are against.

Matching can be done at the speed orders are received over network, so there's no reason to queue orders before matching. It would take more time to queue than match.
And if something is broken it should just report an error instead of queueing things.

An interesting question is whether we can do this sort of voting without making any sort of security compromises. (Hashed public keys and one-time-only addresses can be understood as hardening of a potentially weak ECDSA scheme.)
A simple way to do it is to commit to a secondary key in a transaction you make, storing it e.g. as OP_RETURN data. This requires a custom wallet (or making transactions manually), though.
And it's probably possible to do it with no extra data, but that would require some crypto tricks and thus even more custom wallet.

That's the reality of software development. Porting/merging is hard. Software development isn't so much about ideas as it is about getting _everything_ right, and it doesn't become easier when you can look at code done by other team.
You can see how it works with alt-coins: many are stuck with old versions of Bitcoin Core they forked from and do not get patched with latest updates. Even Litecoin which has several competent developers but still moving from 0.6 to 0.8 codebase was a major undertaking and took them a while. And that's basically the simplest case.
Anyway, going from 1 project with 20 developers to 10 projects with 2 developers would result in much worse quality and/or slower development. A lot of development doesn't require any new ideas but is completely mundane stuff like re-arranging code, writing tests, etc, and it helps a lot when you have a lot of developers to do this small mundane things when in a long run will improve quality.
If you don't have enough devs you start to cut corners. We'll refactor this later, we'll optimize this later, we'll test it later. So if project is big you eventually accumulate technical debt and quality suffers.

PoW miners create new coins and sell them on the market. With the proceedings they can buy electricity and hardware needed to do operations. Coins sold on the market increase supply, and thus lower the price.
Imagine a hypothetical coin (perhaps a Bitcoin soft fork) which has no inflation. There will be less bitcoins hitting the market, so price could be higher, but, on the other hand, miners revenue would consist of only transaction fees, so Bitcoin mining industry would be smaller than it is now, and Bitcoin would be less secure in this case.

It doesn't. All miners promised is to consider it. They are not required to stick to it. Nobody can force them to.
Check what happens with Bitcoin Cash: miners mine it for a couple of hours until difficulty jumps up, then abandon it and switch back to Bitcoin.
What this means is that miners are not committed to any particular chain, they just maximize their profit.
Miners do not mine Bitcoin because they have to, they mine Bitcoin to make money.
So they will just follow the price. You can see now on BitFinex that BT2 is valued at 30% of BT1, so at best it will get 30% of hashrate.
And that NYA signalling doesn't mean anything, it doesn't cost miners anything to put these three letters into coinbase so they do that, it has no formal meaning.

Anti-money laundering measures [are globally enforced]( otherwise they'd be ineffective.
Exchanges which work with fiat money need a bank account, thus they need to interact with a bank. And a bank knows that it will get into a problem if exchange has no AML. 
United States have control over US dollars, and since USD is used by pretty much all banks globally, it has control over global banking system (wake up, sheeple!). If a bank doesn't follow the rules it will be isolated and thus won't be able to function.

1. You're confusing EU with Eurozone. A country can be in EU and have its own currency if it wishes to.
2. Single market: companies can sell within EU without paying tariffs. It's much more efficient. Even more so when they use single currency and do not need to do currency conversion.
3. Freedom of movement.
4. Cultural exchange, more education opportunities, common science projects, etc.
5. Most important thing is that EU resulted in peace. Previously, this was a huge problem: there was a major war between European countries at least each 50 years. Of course, that resulted in major destruction, loss of life, civility, economic losses, etc. Now that countries have common government, common economy, common currency, etc, it is inconceivable for them to go to war with each other.
So if EU was made just to make war between countries like France, Germany, UK, France, Italy, Spain impossible ever again, that alone is a good idea.
But, I guess, for you "mah freedum" is more important than peace, economy, culture and science. But you know what, it's a bit hard to exercise your freedoms  when your country is at war, especially when you was drafted and have to sit in trenches while being bombed.
As for sovereign states, they used to have a freedom to declare wars. In my opinion, it's better when they can't. If we can prevent "sovereign states" to be able to screw its own people, that would be great.

Well, customers and businesses can make up their own mind about what to use even in United States, you don't need a libertarian utopia for that.
However, you need some kind of a common currency (legal tender) to be able to settle disputes. Otherwise consumers and businesses will try to cheat.
E.g. suppose you've damaged some property, and offer to pay for damaged in GoxBucks, but property owner requests to be paid in physical gold. Now what?
It's possible that neither party's claim is reasonable, as, for example, GoxBucks can't be converted into any other currency, but retail price of physical gold is higher than spot price due to various fees.
It will be very hard for court to decide which requests are legitimate. Much simpler to declare some currency, e.g. Bitcoin, a legal tender, which means that it can be used to pay off any debt.
Additionally, a common currency is useful for denominating prices in (doing currency conversions each time you look at price is annoying) and for paying taxes.

So why, again, do we think that sidechains are going to be secure? 
I think the plan is for sidechains to be merged mined, in that case they'll face same issues as Namecoin.
The theory that rational miners will secure sidechains because they like to collect mining rewards doesn't hold to be true in practice. 
Namecoin pays 25 NMC per block, which are worth 0.04 BTC now. On the Bitcoin chain, miners collect 0.20 BTC from fees now. So suppose that somebody launches a sidechain which becomes quite successful from the start and gets 20% of the total Bitcoin transaction volume. We can expect that in that case it will pay 0.04 BTC per block, so the reward will be the same as exists now on Namecoin chain. And we know that apparently it's not enough to maintain a healthy miner ecosystem. Miners simply do not care about these tiny sums.
Of course, Blockstream can bribe miners to adopt sidechains it runs to make it look like it has a healthy ecosystem when it fact it won't. Which is even worse.
Add to this that there will be an ENORMOUS reward for attacking sidechains.
Merged mining is just a bad idea. The whole point of proof-of-work is that work is spent on a specific cause, that is, securing the blockchain.  The work is not supposed to be re-used, but it's exactly what merged-mined does, allowing miners to pursue several goals at once. This is can even weaken Bitcoin security as potentially it would allow miners to attack Bitcoin while collecting rewards mining some other chain.
And without merged mining sidechans are not going to work, as they are tied to PoW.

Yes, I think. If UTXO set is large and you need to use `Θ(log N)` data structure to store, updating it can be expensive and you might spend a lot of time doing I/O. Validating scripts is still `O(1)`, so at some point UTXO set update will dominate the cost.
However, miners are also known to skimp on trivial things.
So this depends on the nature of your proof-of-local-storage. Normally updates are `O(1)`. But if your proof requires finding UTXOs with out-txid closest to X, you need a tree for that, and hence `Θ(log N)` to update on average, where n is the size of the set.
Alternatively, you can make proof construction `Θ(N)` where N is the size of the set, while UTXO set update is `Θ(K)` where K is the size of the block. If `N &gt;&gt; K` then at some point the former will dominate the cost.

Even if software requires some customization, it can be done cheaply. E.g. Wordpress templates, plugins, Drupal. Ruby on Rails CRUD sites...
Software development becomes hard and unpredictable only if you do something new and innovative. It becomes obvious if you formulate it this way: you can't mass-produce innovation.
So I doubt there is a big problem which need to be solved by revolutionizing the field. We're already doing quite well. Some big projects have failed in the past, but maybe that's because they were run by incompetent assholes, or were too big and complex for their time or budget. But, for example, Google has no problems with big and complex projects. Apparently companies which can employ top developers in vast quantities have no problems with complexity...

Sidechains might use different trust models internally, but the whole idea is that PoW is used to move bitcoins from sidechain back to the main chain. So they _are_ tied to PoW.
The big idea is that it is possible to do pegging in a trustless way if the mainnet miners will examine proofs based on PoW, so they don't need to examine sidechain validity, they only need to check the isolated proof.
Sidechain-Elements uses federated peg trust model, this is why it is called Elements, not sidechain. Previously federated peg was known as "voting pools" and was an expected add-on for Open Transactions. Let's not rewrite the history claiming that everything is a sidechain now.

Actually, I think, it should be easy to tell whether MagicalTux's side of a story makes sense: he should show a log of orders right before and after sell-off.
Were there, indeed, 0.01 orders before Kevin put his 0.0101 order or not?
If there were orders all over the place and Kevin's order was in middle of them and it looks like he just got lucky by setting somewhat different price. Then it would be rather weird for a 'hacker' to bet 250k BTC on a random luck. (What if somebody would buy at 0.0102?)
If Kevin's order stands out as if he was aware of sell-off before it started then it is a good case against Kevin.
MagicalTux is rather secretive about details and he threatens people with FBI.

The problem with "the death" approach is that a project might he hijacked.
Let's try to abstract Bitcoin out of it. Suppose some guy, let's call him Foo, started a project to improve math education. Like a software with interactive problem solving etc. Suppose it's really good, but somewhat unfinished, so can't yet adopted by schools. And also it has some interesting puzzles, mini-games which help with some math concepts.
Suppose that Foo suddenly dies. The project can't be adopted as an education tool until it's finished. But a lot of people find the puzzles and mini-games very appealing. Potentially millions and millions of people would love to play this puzzles.
So some developers say: "Let's rip the mathy stuff out and leave only the games, make an iPad game out of it, it will be a major hit!". Suppose that without the math context games are worthless for education, but are quite entertaining. Is this OK?
Obviously, this would be a dick move, as it disrespects the original author and his intent. Yes, people _can_ do that (if the license allows that), but it's extremely disrespectful.
The right thing to do would be to finish it as a educational project and try to deploy it in practice. Maybe make iPad games too, if that doesn't have a negative impact on the educational goals.
So, I think, this is why people are asking what would Satoshi do. They respect Satoshi's original vision and would like to continue with that instead of hijacking the project.
Understandably, more people can relate to Bitcoin as a replacement to credit cards because it's what they interact with daily. But this use might be, at least in the current context, antagonistic to Bitcoin as a super-decentralized, censorship-resistant digital gold, which is probably much less relevant to most people's daily lives. So the question is whether focusing on the former would be OK if it a big crowd hijacking the project because they could not understand the original intent.
Respect is usually a good thing, as it overrides selfishness (which often leads to bad outcomes, cf. the tragedy of commons). But, of course, one can say "let's override the original intent of the author, as the alternative would be a greater social good". But this needs to be a conscious choice, not just going with a popular opinion.

coalesces as if by magic from their combined efforts.
Yeah sure, if we think hard enough, software will just write itself.


away until the translation into code becomes as simple as
placing bytes into a native binary executable. ... At this point, no further
extension is necessary, as foundation vendors, using the
construction-site protocol, simply place bytes into what will
eventually become the resulting binary executable. 
WTF are these people stuck in 1960? People don't code directly in binary nowadays, there are better ways.
I can't decide if authors are crackpots or academic people who learned about coding using books written in 60s.
It's best to imagine that it was actually written before we had high-level language, then we can say that this vision is already realized:
 * software engineers do not deal with _binary_ code domain now
 * instead, they _design_ software using formalized descriptions (so-called high-level programming languages)
 * and tools (compilers, linkers) mechanically produce software binaries
Isn't this awesome... Damn people, we live in the future!
EDIT: Aha, [the hall on CodeValley site]( has a selection of comments from Slashdot, mostly making fun of authors and trying to bring them back to senses. So yes, these are crackpots, not academics.

A wallet which has a private key corresponding to address X will look for UTXOs with scriptPubKey corresponding to X and will display sum of values of UTXOs as a wallet balance. It is not just "technically-related", there is a direct relationship between address(es) and wallet balance, and everybody except you get this. And wallet balance represents a stake user has in the Bitcoin economy, his spending power, etc.

Do you really see no problem with Bitcoin ran by a cartel of cooperating miners? Yes, they invested work, and they'd like to protect their investment.
And also for the government it's much easier to pressure the cartel into something than to go after individual anonymous miners.
So what you call "a balance point" might be Bitcoin's monkey trap. It's certainly lucrative to process a large number of transactions, but it will also makes it much more vulnerable.
You know, when Bitcoin was solo-mined by end users, it was pretty much unstoppable. It's pretty much impossible to go after thousands of even millions of such users. But if a handful of large operations which have invested in big datacenters and fast interconnects do the bulk of mining, it is an industry, and governments know how to work with industries to achieve what they want.

A "true cypherpunk" should exercise caution. I'll remind you the cypherpunk movement was about privacy. So here you have a product developed by a large (it got &gt;100M in investment which is huge in startup terms) VC backed company.
VC backed companies are have extremely poor privacy track record. Many SV companies are built specifically to violate privacy (e.g. Facebook, Palantir).

I've already implemented several Bitcoin wallets and co-authored an academic paper about Bitcoin, so I'm fairly certain I know how it works.
So the idea of the message board is that your votes' weight is proportional to amount of bitcoins you can spend. Thus we need a proof that a person owns a certain amount of bitcoins. One way to do it is to create scriptSig for every UTXO person owns. But then people would need to use special software to produce such proofs. On the other hand, many wallets have an option of sign a message using key corresponding to an address, so this can be used to construct proofs in simple P2PKH case.
The board already successfully works as advertised. It can be improved in many ways, but tbh I'm not sure such a board is a good idea in the first place.

Trustless =/= decentralized. You need to hold your money on a balance of a specific node, when it's down you can't make a payment. Yes, if it is down, you can get your money out after some time.
But it is pretty far from Bitcoin where you just do not care which miners mines your transaction.
@_date: 2015-09-17 16:20:39
No. If you can't do fast queries against UTXO set you will be DoSed by transaction validation. This is completely unrelated to proof-of-local-storage.
E.g. attacker will send you invalid transactions with random inputs. You will have to perform an UTXO query for each such transaction. If UTXO query is on HDD which can do only 100 random reads per second, you won't be able to process more than 100 transactions per second.
Likewise, validating a block might take a while. So miners have to store UTXO set either in RAM or on a fast SSD.
Now UTXO set queries which are necessary for proof-of-local-storage come at a predictable rate, so I don't see how DoS is possible. Yes, you need a storage which is fast enough. It is just one of requirements for miners.

The whole concept is utterly stupid. If it these cloud-connected appliances make sense, it will be more efficient for owner to pay subscription fee.
It just needs to be convenient. E.g. suppose you connect a new appliance to your home network, it does automatic discovery and your smartphone gets a notification "You connected appliance XXX, it will increase your monthly bill by $0.05, Confirm?".

Same thing, essentially. All transactions are publicly available, so hackers cannot just wipe everything. Everybody has a copy.

When flaw is discovered you need to stop doing transactions. I.e. kill your bitcoin server.

Meni Rosenfeld and Iddo Bentov proposed artificial restriction on the amount of bitcoins transferred in a block rather than its size in bytes.
In that case we expect transaction fees to be proportional to the amount sent rather than to a size, which means that parties sending bigger transactions (in terms of value) pay more to secure them, which is usually the right thing. The value cap parameter is kinda arbitrary, though.


If this is the crux of the argument then it's rather weak in my opinion. Yes, some people are generous. But on the other hand, bigger companies are usually profit-optimizing to the point people perceive them as evil. In any case, i don't think it's something we can depend on.

They could do it this way: client creates a smart contract transaction templates, sign it with an unique device key, sends it to 21 inc server. Server adds enough bitcoins to cover fees and publishes the transaction.
We use this approach in [Cuber]( users only need to have colored coins in his wallet, bitcoin fees are paid either by the receiving party or by a payment gateway. No special hardware required. We know this approach works as it's already in use for 5 month.

Quote from phantomcircuit:


This is _exactly_ kind of problem you'd encounter with a language like PHP (weak, dynamic typing): there are no type checks and (often) no error checks, so a value returned in case of error might get converted to something else and used.
People need to learn that they should use statically typed languages like Java and C# for financial stuff -- there is simply no way for them to fail in this was as code is checked at compile time.
Yes, it takes a bit more time to make a web app in static languages, but you won't need very rigorous testing and prolonged bug fixing stages, so in the end it costs _less_.

It looks like there is a lot of confusion about what are these bitcoin addresses and why they are necessary.
You can think that address is closely related to bill or invoice from accounting perspective. I.e. when you've supplied something you would give person a bill which has an unique number. Bitcoin address is this unique number, it can be used for tracking whether a person have paid.
Perhaps it makes sense to make an accounting-oriented client which would allow to create invoices. I guess that would make a lot of sense to business people.

Yes.




I don't see how.

Network generates one block in approximately each 10 minutes. When you have one block confirming transaction it is already a good thing: counterparty can double-spend only if a competing block was generated somewhere at the same time and it has another transaction with same coin. It is rare and it is unlikely that somebody will pull this off, so I think one confirmation is enough for small sum transactions. Two confirmations to be really sure. More than that is needed only if you have rather large transactions.

This is better, but not real-time. I think you can get realtime only if you use a central clearing house like MyBitCoin site.

Pretty much all the money I have in bank. But there are a paper records so it is possible to catch attacker and return the money.

But if bitcoins are stolen we can see where they go but bitcoin addresses are not associated with any physical address so it is hard to catch attacker.

Maybe there should be a mechanism to ban certain coins or something like that to discourage stealing. (I.e. nodes will ignore transactions using certain addresses.)

BTW if you worry about computer hackers you can move some of your bitcoins to a separate wallet, then burn this wallet on CD (maybe additionally encrypting it) and delete it from disk. Then it is only possible to do anything with this coins if you get physical CD, attacking computer won't help.

(4.) As main chain effectively confirms a block when it includes transactions from it main chain 'confirmations' can indeed diverge from 'sub-chain' confirmations. As a edge case solution I think sub-chains should treat main-chain confirmations as authoritative, as they are much more interested in main-chain accepting their transactions than main-chain is interested in accepting their ones (it also makes sense because main-chain miners probably have more power). So once sub-chain block was confirmed by main-chain it should be prioritized over any sub-chain block chain even if it is longer.
As a practical solution, though, main-chain should accept transactions only once they have enough confirmation. E.g. 5 or maybe 10 or more. This makes blocks-lost-due-to-sync-with-main-chain situation very unlikely and people can still rely on the fact that transactions are unlikely to be unwound once they get enough confirmations.
This slows down moving money between chains, but if it would be done mostly by 3rd party exchangers that would be ok. If it would take, for example, a day for transaction to clear it is still acceptable. It is only important for a possibility of moving money to exist, the rest can be done through market forces.
(5.) Yep, I see. Both merchant and customer are interested in cheap and fast interoperarability so they are likely to cooperate with either one of money changers or a service which let's them to choose one of money changers. But there is a problem with trust... Perhaps it is easier to do this on merchant's side because merchant is likely to have many transaction per day and so if merchant fools him he loses only a relatively small amount of money. But a honest merchant will earn a lot in transaction fees (more than he will earn from a stealing a single transaction worth of money) so merchant and money changer are likely to develop a lasting relationship.
But it would be nice to solve trust issue on protocol level. This would allow automatic choice of money changers, for example, which makes sense for person-to-person transactions.
I was thinking about conditional transactions: transaction is not considered executed until certain condition is seen. Of course, it should be a condition verifiable by network nodes. It probably also needs expiry, otherwise money will be locked forever in limbo.
In your example we need transaction Y-&gt;Z (customer to exchanger) to depend on whether Z-&gt;X is executed. Then exchanger cannot fool anybody: if he does not pay to merchant he won't get customer's money and money will be returned to customer after expiry.
It is pretty easy to implement within one chain. Would work among sub-chain and main-chain as sub-chain nodes need to follow main-chain txns anyway.
But sub-chain on sub-chain dependency is kinda tricky, probably would have to go through main-chain.
(This conditional transaction thing would be also very useful for escrows of various sorts. For example I'm now implementing a futures trading service, conditional transactions would remove the need to send everything to service owner.)


Good idea. I know this algorithm but didn't think about it in context of bitcoins. I'm not quite comfortable with the need to keep blocks _forever_. Use of Merkle trees would allow to knock off some branches but it's a bit sub-optimal, I think.
Assuming finite divisibility with a good compaction algorithm total size of block chain will be limited (by some obscenely high number, but still), which is much better than chain constantly growing in size up to infinity :)
@_date: 2011-04-28 10:54:43
If we keep the current model where all transactions need to be visible to everyone to ensure correctness and bitcoin economy will continue to grow then at some point running a node would require so much resources that it won't be possible for casual users.

Thus users will have to rely on powerful nodes which act as clearing houses of some sort.

If there are trusted clearing houses then you don't need that many transactions as clearing houses can settle transactions internally and use real bitcoin transactions only to settle final balances among themselves. 

I.e. consider [eWallet]( like [MyBitcoin](






So I think use of ewallets or stuff like that would be pretty much inevitable whether you want it or not.

The only other option is to restructure protocols and, perhaps, cryptography to support divide-and-conquer algorithms of some sort. Maybe multiple block chains instead of a single monolithic one, with groups of nodes each responsible for its own chain.

So pretty much like what they do in distributed hash tables.

Sigh... Gavin keeps writing blog posts instead of writing papers. What's the difference?
Level of rigor. "The assumption that a constant proportion of users will run full nodes as the network grows might be incorrect" is a very weak statement and it doesn't refute anything. This shit won't stand up to a peer review.
I think it's a pity that a guy who was previously known as "chief scientists" wrote exactly zero scientific-looking papers on the crucial (according to him) subject of scalability. He keeps writing these blog posts which are cheering the crowds, so maybe he's a chief cheerleader, not chief scientist?

Yep, that's how I see it. (4) is necessary for scalability, this was my main idea. (Just N interoperable chains do not improve anything.)
I don't get what do you mean by hooks in (5). I agree that moving money through 3rd-party exchangers which run as normal transactions would make it faster and also will offload the network. But as those are just normal transactions from network standpoint I don't see why some 'hooks' are necessary. Do you mean that exchangers should be accessible through client UI or that there should be some support for exchange transactions in the protocol?

For small purchases like this you can use a third party services, like eWallet or something like that. Basically, both you and store should rely on a single centralized authority for settlement and Bitcoins will be used as an underlying asset.

People become in debt to other people. It has absolutely nothing to do with the Federal reserve.

7300 apples is the amount of debt, denominated in apples. It doesn't mean that 7300 apples exists somewhere, or that apples are backed by Apple Federal Reserve. It's just a number.

If it will be widely used for small purchases _that will work too_. People who want to make those purchases will just buy bitcoins from people who have excess.

United States is not the only country in the world, you know. As long as there is just one country which haven't banned it yet it won't be _that_ hard to run an exchanger. (And consider offshore financial centers -- Bermuda, Cayman Islands etc. -- which are already famous for shoddy financial activity.)

It might be a problem to exchange money for US citizens. Buying won't be an issue, as VISA and Mastercard are available everywhere and nobody can control what you're buying. (Well, as long as USA doesn't go full North Korea.)

Exchanging bitcoins back is more problematic, but I think it is feasible with some amount of creativity. You can do operations with accounts in foreign banks and then move it to US claiming that it is profit from investment, for example. As long as you're paying taxes on it IRS wouldn't mind, I think.

Or you can buy, say, stocks, at discount (which is paid by bitcoins you own) and then sell them for USD. Then USD come from stock sale and it would be pretty hard to prove that discount was paid by bitcoins. Some stocks naturally have high volatility so it won't even look suspicious.

Also I think it would be rather hard to ban bitcoins without buying all other virtual currencies -- linden dollars, WoW money gift cards, etc, etc. Otherwise 1) bitcoin is very similar to in-game toy money, pretty much indistinguishable; 2) you can exchange bitcoins for, say, linden dollars and then exchange linden dollars to USD.

And banning everything virtual will piss of a lot of people.

Because it is the only way to make sure that certain person have paid to you (rather than other person).
Another reason is that it kills anonymity, both for you and for people you interact with. I.e. if you use address more that once it is easier to associate transactions with your identity. E.g. prove that you've bought drugs or funded dissidents.


Bank accounts, telephones and mailing addresses are not anonymous crypto-currencies, right?
Particularly, with bank transaction you see who you're receiving money from, that's how you identify customer. You see it right in your bank client or on papers they give you, info with full name etc. etc.
With bitcoins you just receive money from a bunch of addresses, in one transaction or in many. There is no way to tell who paid how much, by design.
If your counterparty is using the official client you probably will be able to trace transaction and find how much he have paid.
But what if he is using eWallet such as MyBitcoin? Or maybe he would pay from MtGox directly. Then money will come from a random set of addresses not associated with any particular identity (and they can and will be used for payments from other people).
Then there is simply no way to make sure that this entity have paid you and not the other. (Unless transaction sum is an unique number.)
So, well, reusing addresses is a bad idea unless you're absolutely do not care whom you're receiving money from (a case with donations).
Otherwise, if you're selling something it is ridiculous. There is an established practice: create an address for each customer/purchase.

Perhaps my comments could influence programming language choice of next bitcoin startup founders, so what's wrong about it?


 
I don't think it is hard to learn and use other programming languages, it would take maybe a month for a person who already knows programming.
A lot of PHP popularity can be explained by inertia. Maybe it was justified years ago when only PHP shared hosting was cheap and abundant, but not we have more choices, including VPSs which do not limit choice of language.
But people still use PHP just because it was popular years ago. I guess it will fade away sooner of later, and through a little education effort we can help it to fade sooner :)

That's a really good question. My guess is that it has something to do with depth of market (check charts at MtGox). We have large price moves when transaction volumes exceed available depth. So if large market makers and arbitragers will join the game it will improve stability.

I bet it will take a lot of time (many years) because right now we have entities which have accumulated lots of bitcoins so they can do pretty much anything with the market. To effectively deal with these entities will require orders of magnitudes more independent nodes _and_ few years to accumulate bitcoins distributed among independent nodes.

At $0.1 it still looked like some geeks playing with their pocket money. (And that's essentially what it was.)


Nothing special. Minecraft is something some guy created by writing computer code. There are games with economy bigger than &gt;$1M, so no, it was not particularly amazing.

There was an effort to make a spec, but the problem is that there are so many details, and if you miss one of them your implementation will end up being on a fork. Also the spec needs to be compatible with the existing implementations, even fixing bugs is not allowed: otherwise the "fixed" implementation will be incompatible.
So the only option is to say that the code is the spec. Because it actually is.

Number of coins mined with each block will be decreased (i.e. 50 BTC currently, then 25, then 12.5 and so on), up to the point when there will be no new coins awarded.

Block size is simply a technical issue rather than a part of the vision. It is a bad idea to be fixated on particular decisions which were made in the past, but it makes sense to check whether we are on the right path.
So what we know that Satoshi was a pragmatic person, he understood that Bitcoin needs some time to grow and is not ready for some challenges. For example, when people wanted to use Bitcoin to organize a fundraiser for Assange, he asked people not to do it as an attention of authorities could kill Bitcoin at a very early stage. And this approach have worked quite well so far.
But anyway, as for me personally, I see valid arguments on the both sides of the block size debate. I think the proper solution would be to find an algorithmic solution to the scalability problem (I doubt that cryptocurrency actually requires _global_ consensus), but if it is not available right now, we need to make decision. If arguments on the both sides are valid, then the difference is in preferences and assumptions. And so for me, personally, it is important what Satoshi thought about it, because I don't it's right to take into account only one's personal preferences when considering a decisions which affects a lot of people.
I don't think that the opinion of the masses is important (\*), I don't think that we should just ask some experts (how do we select them?), and certainly my own opinion is not particularly important, but it makes sense to ask the opinion of the guy who started it and defined the initial trajectory.
\*: You might say "let the users decide", but when we have a global project like Bitcoin, when we're deciding on the direction, we're also deciding for the future users. So imagine two outcomes are possible X and Y. And today a million people decide X. But, perhaps, if we decided Y, in future we'd have a billion of people who prefer Y.

Using Bitcoin-insired design (aka "the blockchain") gives you certain advantages over conventional databases. I already listed those.


Well, hypothetically somebody can take Bitcoin source code and replace PoW-based block validation with a different rule: "Block is valid as long as it is signed by at least 51 of these 100 pre-defined signatures".

Why do you think that they "increase the value of Bitcoin"?
They started as a block explorer/API company. Not unlike blockchain.info.
Then they added [OpenAssets]( support to that API and did some prototype for NASDAQ.
Now they removed all the information from their site, I suspect they're doing private blokchains for enterprise clients like NASDAQ. This has absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin, they aren't adding value.

A brief history of "Bitcoin stock exchanges":
1. 2011: GLBSE (Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange) was the first one. Initially it used a custom client (command line app) and had everything secured by cryptography, but later it was redesigned like a normal web site. It had several dozen companies listed, mostly Bitcoin mining operations, also some "funds", derivatives, etc.
2. 2012: MPEX. This one is [still alive]( has/had the biggest volume, hosted the biggest IPO: Satoshi Dice gambling web site raised several million dollars in Bitcoin. Companies listed there are mostly startups operating in Bitcoin and crypto niches. It also used to offer Bitcoin options
3. 2012: GLBSE collapse. GLBSE ceased to exist, its operator hinted potential legal issues. Migrating from GLBSE to other exchanges was a major PITA.
4. 2012: Several smaller exchanges e.g. Litecoin Global / BTCT / BitFunder appeared and hosted assets migrated from GLBSE. At that point people understood an importance of having some sort of an independent owner registry which can be used for painless migration. Companies listed are mostly mining operations, mining equipment manufacturers, but also some startups not all of them are Bitcoin-related. (Perhaps, the cutest one is a bakery in Mexico.)
5. 2013: We had several bigger and more legitimate IPOs, particularly CoinTerra (mining equipment manufacturer, on picostocks) and NEO&amp;BEE (payment processor, bank in Cyprus). In both cases the companies were actually registered and there was some linkage between actual equity and equity on these exchanges. Also some companies, e.g. ASICMINER, demonstrated the viability of the concept by paying significant dividends to investors.
6. 2013: The first token crowdsale: Mastercoin.
7. 2014: Collapse of previously promising IPOs: CoinTerra went bankrupt, NEO&amp;BEE turned out to be a scam. Even though it looked as legitimate as it can be. People become disillusioned. Most "Bitcoin stock exchanges" have closed due to legal issues.
8. 2014: More crowdsales: Ethereum, MaidSafe, Storj.
9. 2015: Several "Bitcoin stock exchanges" still operating: picostocks and Havelock investments, for example, but there isn't much interest in this stuff.


Yes, technically you can do that. Mastercoin and Counterparty have a 100% decentralized exchange, with colored coins you can have a mostly-decentralized one. There is also Ripple...
Very few legitimate companies are listed there, if any at all.
In general, the problem with "Bitcoin stock exchanges" is that they attract mostly low-quality companies/projects, and a large number of scams. Indeed, if you know how to do things professionally, why would you go to Bitcoin stock exchanges when you can get funding from angels/VCs with none of legal woes? Besides that, it is now hard to raise money this way because most potential investors got disillusioned.

"Yeees, that is kind of the point?" isn't a statement, it isn't even correct grammatically.
As for the OP, if we assume that "value per bitcoin" is roughly same as exchange rate ("value per bitcoin" = "value of one bitcoin" = "how much you can buy for one bitcoin" ≅ "how much you can buy after exchangint it to USD"), so he that that exchange rate decreases while staying constant.
I see no other statements in this thread.
As for your question, I guess you were confused by word "expect". I mean that  if you're observing constant exchange rate, then following conditions must hold. It wasn't a prediction.

It looks like 'community' likes to hear bullshit tales about security in the main client getting better. Sorry, I can't help it. From what I understand about security it is simply not possible.


This can be fixed in a simple way: client running on Windows will collect _relevant_ blocks (or, maybe, all blocks) onto a removable storage medium.
Later LiveCD client will read them, analyze and use to send transaction. You do not need whole block chain to send money.


Did I? LiveCD is supposed to be used with removable storage medium such as flash drive. It can automatically check availability of new bitcoin release, download it, verify (using public key cryptography) and install on a flash drive.
This is way more secure than what people use now. (As no verification step is involved.)
Dude, I'm a motherfucking security and usability genius. I can design a system which would be both secure and a bliss to use, because it will also have blackjack and hookers. But dumb bitches on forums are always whining....
Seriously, though, we can have a real discussion on how it is possible to make a more secure clients OR we can call each other idiots. What do you prefer?

There are other ways to arrange it: one flash drive. Two flash drives. External HDD. Smartphone. The only limit is yourself.

No. Hardware manufacturer, e.g. Samsung, can sign device's public key. So now a device can prove that it's an unique device created by Samsung.
On the other hand, if device mining chip usually holds 1000 satoshi, then you need just 1 bitcoin to impersonate 100000 such devices... So Bitcoin isn't a particularly useful as an anti-Sybil measure.

I wonder where I can find recent information on transaction fees. Wiki article on the matter describes how it was working in 0.3.20, which is a bit outdated.
I'm making a service where users can send bitcoins to their accounts and withdraw from them (among other things). It bothers me that if txn fee is required I can't easily pass it on user, I have to pay it from my pocket.
Is there a good way to deal with this or people who run services like this just suck up the loss?
I've seen few forum discussions which talked about exorbitant fees on scale of ~1 BTC per transaction for not-so-large amounts (less than 100 BTC). I'm not excited to pay like $20 just because network decides so.
EDIT: Answering my own question, from source code I see that 0.0005  is a base fee instead of 0.01 base fee. It is what you pay to send amount less than 1 cent and for each 1 KB of transaction and to prioritize transactions in larger blocks.

I guess this requires additional explanation.

Some programmers are perfectionist, they aim to get things right even if it costs them a lot of effort.

Other programmers are pragmatic, they want to get things done, they can write code which "sort of works" quickly, but they do not test extensively edge conditions and things like that.

As you can see from numerous [Rasmus Lerdorf quotes]( he is a programmer of a second kind. He have built a language for himself, for his Personal Home Page. He did not know how to make a formal grammar parsing so he had some ad-hoc parser. This sort of worked, less than ideally, but who cares?

It looks like PHP development always attracted people like Rasmus because perfectionists scorned the whole design.

Please understand me correctly, I'm not attacking Rasmus and the team personally. They are good programmers in sense that they've managed to make a useful and widely used programming language.

A problem with immediate settlement is that it is prone to market manipulation: a person who owns large contract might manipulate spot price to win a settlement and use payout to compensate his loss on manipulation.

There are two things which help with that:

1. Price smoothing: 24h average price on MtGox is used as the spot price. It is hard to manipulate this average as large contracts from other parties might move market in either direction and so it is risky.

2. Hidden limits: there will be both minimal visible limits and real hidden limits. E.g. parties agree to reserve at least 25% of amount in BTC to pay profit/loss to other party and that defines minimal price range where price can move before triggering settlement. But both parties can put more into reserves without showing it to other party, and thus it will widen range.

So let's say minimal reserve parties agreed on is 25%, but they've actually reserved 75%. One party tries to cheat and drives MtGox spot price 25% up. But, huh, no luck. He drives it up to 50%, but again no luck. Then it either has to suck up the loss or drive it even further.

The only difference I see is that state enforces rules within certain geographical area, while 'justice companies' probably don't. But I'm fairly sure that if we had multiple 'justice providers' they would divide territory among themselves so it will be pretty much same thing.
But more importantly, for-profit 'justice company' might at some point (like, from the beginning) realize that it is more profitable to provide general coercion services rather than just justices. Basically, racket. So you'll have a number of gangs which have divided territory among themselves.

The problem with VCs is that they do not like slow growth. They want a company to become big in 2-3 years or die, and they encourage companies to spend like there is no tomorrow.
BitPay built their platform years ago, so they don't need to have massive R&amp;D expenses, and the money they raised could last them for years and years. But it's just not something VCs are interested in.

I've already proposed a solution: 1. each main-chain node follows all subchains and thus can verify all transactions. 2. sub-chains must give main-chain a priority, otherwise they will be kicked out of exchange. 3. there is a certain delay for sub-chain transactions to be incorporated into main chain.
I see no edge cases, it is as secure as BitCoin is.
Essentially, main-chain nodes are responsible for maintaining validity of the whole system, and they can do this because they see the whole thing and can discard wrong blocks/transactions.
So primary concern is a double-spend attack led by one of main-chain nodes: it can give smaller block chain a priority thus invalidating history recorded in a longer chain. (E.g. smaller block chain is forged, real block chain is real.)
But these attack can be policed by main-chain nodes: as they see current status of sub-chain they will notice that rogue main-chain node have included a forking block instead of a block of a currently longest chain and they will reject main-chain block as invalid for this reason.
Thus to successfully implement this attack you need to isolate _majority of main-chain nodes_ from real sub-chain activity for a significant amount of time.
If you're able to carry out such attack then you can as well fragment any block chain into multiple forks and use it to make double-spending transactions.
So this is not a new vulnerability, it is an inherent BitCoin protocol property.
Now the scheme above puts enormous strain on main-chain nodes, same strain they would take if there was just one block chain.
But I believe there is a trade-off between security, speed of transactions and resource consumption.
For example, instead of full block information some of main-chain nodes can keep only block headers. They still will know which chain is longest and thus can reject forking attempts.

Prepaid cards, maybe? They pay through your website and get a ticket that proves that they've paid a certain amount. Then they come to you in person and show this ticket.
Give each ticket a number to ensure that same ticket is not cashed out twice and record this numbers on a sheet of papers. That's all.
The only problem is that people need to know how much they would want to spend. (But you can promise to give a change either in bitcoins or in bucks, just some time later.)
Also, different shops can't share same ticketing system unless they have access to shared piece of paper to record cashed-out tickets.

There was a bubble. People blame positive feedback loops, but much simple explanation is correlated buying decisions.
Basically, if one guy decides he wants to invest his money into Bitcoin, he's by no means is unique and likely there other people who want the same. A lot of buying over a small time frame causes price to rise.
Eventually this comes to end and then you have price tanking.
Price movements became much less dramatic in the last 6 months, and even more so in the last 1 month, so it looks like we got to an equilibrium between selling and buying.

To be honest I get suspicious when people even mention sanitization. It sounds like they believe that they can add some code which will prevent security problems.
It makes about as much sense as using a dedicated firewall software/hardware with anti-XSS features (i.e. it will watch HTTP requests and drop everything which looks like script in parameters) instead of simply preventing XSS by coding it correctly in the first place.
Input validation is necessary, of course, -- everything which comes from external sources should be checked to conform to program expectations and rules. But 'sanitization' suggests that it is somehow possible to get unclean, messy input and transform it to a clean and secure one. And it is, generally, bullshit.

This is a good goal, but they are missing one simple fact (which was originally stated by Balaji's buddy): [Software Is Eating The World](
Hardware becomes increasingly irrelevant, as any software can run on any hardware if it is sufficiently powerful (Turing completeness and all that).
Machine to machine payments are already possible. The only point of custom hardware (with integrated mining chips) is to finance these transactions. 
But is it a right approach? it is certainly convenient for the user that appliance requires no maintenance and just keeps working... But...
You aren't seeing the whole picture. The whole picture is that in the end user is paying for everything: when he pays for the device, he pays for the mining chip and the licensing fees 21 Inc takes. He pays for electricity. He pays for the internet.
It would be much more efficient for user to pay for it directly, as it will cost him less. If user already has bitcoins he can directly finance the needs of appliances he's using just like he provides electricity. But we need software for that...
So what 21 inc. create is akin to a crankshaft laptop. It's definitely a temporary thing, not a long-term strategy.
But is it at least convenient and viable in the short-term? Debatable.
 * It is fragile. Mining difficulty varies, so device can get "broken" (won't be able to perform its functions) if difficulty climbs too much... And it is out of control of vendors. So one day all their devices might appear broken.
 * It works only for internet-connected devices.
 * It works only for wired devices as mining on battery is outright asinine.
So yes, it is as convenient as a crankshaft laptop... Obviously there are situations where electricity is unavailable, but it's better to use a separate electricity source (e.g. solar panels) instead of making it a part of a laptop.
Another example is [:CueCat]( which in modern terms is something like a QR code reader. We now know that QR codes are indeed incredibly useful. However, having a dedicated device just for that is inconvenient. So CueCat was a flop, even though QR code scanning became commonplace once people were able to do that using an app on their smartphones.
So again, doing custom hardware for the things which can be done in software is stupid.

Either there should be no new coins made during mining at all or only one chain is allowed to mine (say, HubCoin, a central one).
Otherwise it is messy, as you've noted. The goal is to keep 1:1 exchange rate for all currencies through possibility of automated transfers from one to another.
Floating exchange rate would mean much higher volatility so it would make this setup non-attractive at all.
A fixed exchange rate, say 1:2 won't fix mining issue as you cannot balance different cash streams with fixed exchange rate.
So I see it like this HubCoin can do whatever it wants to with mining awards (via consensus, of course), but if one of sub-chains start issuing new coins they are kicked out of the scheme. (They are no longer automatically exchangeable and so their value will probably drop dramatically).

Doing transfers is a lot faster than 'linking account'.
Transactions with VISA cards are pretty much instantaneous, all around the world.
Bank wire might take a couple of days, but it is suitable for very large transfers.
Do you know why you can't buy bitcoins using fast and hassle-free VISA transactions directly? Because they are fast. When VISA card is stolen (via a computer virus, for example) attacker could instantly buy bitcoins and later cash out.
That's why PayPal (and likely VISA) itself are banning anything which can be used for quick cashing out.
So slowness of money transfer is actually a feature, it allows to do proper checks and cancel transactions if they are not authorized.

Transfer within a country or even within a bank should be faster/cheaper than international wire. For example, I pay 0 fee for money transfer within the bank and counterparty receives money in a hour or so. (It is a business account, though.)
So one way to handle this is to open accounts in many different banks. Either exchanges should do this or their affiliates.

It isn't irrelevant. It should be non-zero, have low volatility, enough volume should be available.
If currency is pegged to some other currency, USD, it has to be actively managed by issuing authority to maintain price stability.
If exchange rate is market-decided, like with BTC, you need a well-established market with high value, depth, etc. Good luck finding a market for 'free hugs'. That's actually the difference between bitcoin and various forks using same algorithms and software -- thin market make them unusable for value transfer.
If you declare that your token is like gold, but you won't exchange it back to gold, good luck finding idiots who would trust you.
Bitcoin was bootstrapped in an unique way: initially people were mining and exchanging them just for fun, they didn't care much about value, but then price went up, speculators came to market and some people started actually using it.
So what we have is a currency with 100% marked-defined value backed by nothing, only scarcity. I don't think it would be easy to bootstrap anything like this again.
Sure, there are other way to issue tokens, but they do not match bitcoin issuance in terms of convenience, openness, security and lack of bureaucracy.

You forget that miners can demand arbitrary transactions fees. It will be profitable through the virtue of supply and demand: if miners feel it is not profitable enough they will rise transaction fees on their nodes and it will be slow for anyone who does not pay enough. If fees are too high there will be miners who will agree to work for lower (but still profitable) fees thus cutting into high-fee miner's profits.
If bitcoin economy is too week to support large number of miners then you simply can't help it.
'Mandatory mining' won't help at all: number of nodes participating in transactions will also be low, and so will be their combined CPU power.
Continuing mining awards won't help either as in weak economy each bitcoin costs a little (and ongoing emission would push exchange rate down).
So the only way to make bitcoins  resistant to external attacks/'cornering' of mining is to grow number of transactions, participating nodes, creating demand for bitcoins etc.
OTOH if bitcoins are weak it won't be profitable for external entities to hijack it...

It is like a CPU (or GPU) which you can make yourself. In this context, it is a processing unit dedicated to hashing -- it can do only hashing, but does it very fast.
FPGA can be reprogrammed many times. (I.e. you can use same chip for many different CPU designs).
ASIC is like a CPU which is made at factory but with your design. It cannot be reprogrammed once it's made. Process is rather costly, but if you need many of them in the end it might be cheaper/better than using FPGAs.

Well, maybe then you should know that Linux is a kernel, not an OS.
It can be used to build an OS with desired characteristics. 
For example, it is often used in home routers and users don't give a flying fuck that they have to use Linux because all they see is web interface of said router.
It is even used in some TVs. But hey, did you ever see user complaining that TV is too hard because it is Linux?
Android used on smart phones is also a modified version of Linux.
So, please, don't be an idiot. If appliance uses Linux it does not mean that it is complex.
I'm talking about a specialized appliance CD designed to be used as bitcoin client. User does not even need to know it is linux-based.
Many software products like backup and anti-viral software use Linux-based LiveCDs nowadays and I haven't seen Windows users complaining about it.
They just put it into CD tray, it boots and then they follow instructions on screen.


No, you can use both a regular client on Windows and secure wallet which uses LiveCD + flash drive. That secure wallet is like a savings account, for large sums of money and rare transactions. Regular client is like your pocket money.
Makes sense, no?
Do you have all you savings in a bank accessible from your PC? Or maybe you prefer to keep some part of it 'offline' and require a visit to a bank to move money?
Somehow people do not find it outrageous that they need to visit a bank from time to time, but apparently booting from LiveCD is too much...


I've offered another solution: a smartphone or other standalone device for two-factor authorization.
There is simply NO WAY to make things secure within a single Windows instances. There is a way to make it slightly more secure, but then you'll have a problem with people who keep all their savings on their 'slightly secure' PC wallet.

I think if you translate it to modern terms, by design-contributions they mean header files. So header files contain a list of functions your part implements, call protocol, data structures, but no actual implementation.
The point they're making is that customers and software vendors should design these headers files for the specific project in order to make it all fit together. You cannot call function if it assumes one data format, but you have another.
Then when all necessary functions are described, a software vendor can create object files which implement this particular functions.
Then you get all the headers and object files together and link it into an executable. If you did everything correctly, it works. Software vendors do not need to disclose his source code, only object files.
Sounds cool, right? Well, yeah, it is cool. But we had this back in 1970. It is not a new way, it is the old way.
The only new thing is an emphasis on the collaboration on header files as opposed to "just use our libraries". However, it's not particularly unheard of, for example, two months ago I discussed API with a customer, and we adapted our stuff to make integration simple. So we're already using this "new way".
At least, conceptually. If you look at the text, it talks about executable binaries, addresses, bytes... It is like 5 generations older than what people use now.
A moder way of doing things is service-oriented architecture, SaaS, cloud, microservices. With SaaS, you can easily charge for usage without revealing the internals.
If you want to tie it to Bitcoin somehow, SaaS makes a lot of sense. You can create a peer-to-peer market for SaaS, where one company says "We need API which does this and this", another one offers it as SaaS and charges for each call.
And this thing already exists, sans Bitcoin, though.

1) Windows 2000 is fine.
2) I find it a bit ironic (in some sense) that you try to shame me for mentioning 10 year old technology while my programming language of choice -- Common Lisp -- was designed in 80s and standardized in early 90s, yet it has pretty much all modern features one can think of:
 * strong dynamic typing like in Python
 * both interpreted and compiled, with native code compilers which can rival statically-typed languages (C) in generated code performance
 * very powerful object system with meta stuff, reflection and Aspect Oriented Programming features (it was co-designed by AOP guy, so no wonder)
 * powerful "exception handling" infrastructure with restarts and non-local transfer of control
 * and of course all traditional lisp metaprogramming facilities
 * as for support for modern libraries: I've recently made a bitcoin-related site prototype which used persistent object store backed by BerkeleyDB (NoSQL!), with front-end in JS using JSON-RPC implemented on multithreaded Common Lisp web server
All this stuff was available back in 80s and people knew how to make excellent compilers while keeping language fully dynamic.
That's what you get when language is designed by professors rather than drop-outs. But drop-outs know how to make language which appeals to other drop-outs (you do not need to learn anything to start using it!), so it gets popular, and then people who want to build sites for cheap...

I think you're getting it wrong -- there is absolutely no need in more miners, and existing miners would be happy to have as little competition as possible.
If you can't "read that" then I guess you don't want it enough...
@_date: 2011-06-03 14:52:05


What mistake?


Sure, you can just use "eWallet" or something like that. But Bitcoin was advertised as P2P and decentralized system, and many people understand it that you do not need to rely on 'big guys' to do your business and you can do it yourself. That's how P2P they are used to works, e.g. file sharing. 
Now if running a node (i.e. with a full block chain) is prohibitively expensive for 'small guys' they will have to rely on 'big guys'. And this is a bit too similar to being a client of a bank or a payment system.
While system is still decentralized (as there is no central authority) it is not the Bitcoin people believe in. And now if what people want is 100% P2P system then I guess sooner or later we'll have one. If it won't be Bitcoin then it would be bad for Bitcoin.
Aside from sentiments, if only big guys are going to be full nodes it might be bad for the system because then they can dictate conditions and do whatever they want -- install arbitrary fees, block arbitrary transactions etc.
If there are, say, 10 big players then collusion among them is much more likely than collusion among 100,000 nodes.


Holy shit!
Actually, no, you do not need to purchase an account, I guess nodes will have to receive transactions for free. 'Thin' clients can use simplified verification process where they just look for transaction in a block's tree. So they do not need to rely on one particular node.


How do you know? Currently txn fees are far from tiny.
@_date: 2011-06-04 14:26:12


Unlikely so.
First, you need full chain (with all non-obsolete transactions, estimated to be 30% of all transactions) to verify all transactions. Otherwise, if you have just a tail you'll be able to verify only some transactions. Storing only a short tail makes very little sense as you'll only see what transactions were accepted by miners but you can verify very few of them yourself.
Second, network security depends more on a number of independent miners. Nodes who are not miners help a little (e.g. they won't be spreading outright fraudulent blocks and transactions and therefore will help to mitigate some attacks), but I think that's not enough.


I'm afraid you do not understand the scale of the problem.
At 2000 transactions per second (that's how much VISA handles) one block  will be around 1 GB (see  So, 1 GB per 10 minutes, 6 GB per hour, 144 GB a day, 1 TB a week.
Having a week worth of blocks have a little value.
Storage isn't the only problem. It also requires lots of bandwidth, I/O (you need very fast storage) and CPU.
@_date: 2011-05-01 16:46:21
I guess it makes more sense to work with payment card processors (banks and smaller dedicated payment processors) directly. They won't enforce own bullshit rules but instead will follow VISA/Mastercard/... guidelines.

And I think VISA itself won't forbid bitcoin sale, as it allows sale of gift cards and stuff like that. (Although they generally dislike stuff which can be converted to cash because it can be used to get money from stolen cards: stolen card -&gt; ??? -&gt; cash.)

I was hoping that Bitcoin won't be officially recognized as a form of money and a payment system as long as possible.

If you look at it from technical perspective, it is just a cryptographic/network protocol to exchange cryptographic signatures in a way that guarantees certain invariants (scarcity). 

There is nothing about 'money' on the technical side, I think in theory system like this could be used for many things. Bitcoins have nothing to do with obligations of any sort, there is no central entity which controls them, they have no inherent value.

Even if it is recognized as a payment system it is not different from any in-game "pretend money", toy-money system (which also guarantees scarcity (otherwise game won't be interesting)), or just resources/bonuses/score etc.

I.e. if someone will create a peer-to-peer monopoly game its money would be similar to bitcoins.

But I'm sure government doesn't want to know about all these scarce-resources in game which in theory can be used as a currency.

So why does it want to know about Bitcoin?

I think that's just because Bitcoin is positioned as digital currency/payment system. People (particularly, developers) call it this way and so it is considered in this way.

This, of course, helps with economy growth, but also would allow gov't to ban it or take other actions as there are laws on money laundering, tax evasion, security exchanges and stuff like that.

So if I was trying to implement something like bitcoin from scratch I will try hard to split it into a general transaction processing core and a separate payment system. Then I would encourage uses which are not related to real money -- like use for in-game money (or, even better, other in-game resources which are not called money), name registration (see namecoin), maybe message exchange service and stuff like that. And only then I'd try to introduce 'real money' on top of this.

Then it would be harder for gov't to shut down core transaction processing system because it has both legitimate and illegitimate uses (just like anything else, e.g. official cash), cf. video recorders.

And, more importantly, I guess there would be different attitude, so maybe banning the thing won't even come up.

But if you talk about competing with fiat money from the start results would be different.

You're right, at least in the simplest implementation HubCoin nodes will be as resource-expensive as alternative one big chain's nodes, so it has same problems (only big guys can do this).
But even in this case it might be seen as an improvement because ChainZ nodes, hopefully, requires much less resources and so small nodes can work directly. Therefore they'll be able to settle transactions among themselves, enjoy better security because of participation of a large number of small miners (as distributed computing projects have demonstrated individuals have large computing power when their efforts are combined), they can choose transaction fees as a consensus among small nodes and they will have some bargaining power against big guys in HubCoin -- if there is a problem with HunCoin sub-chains might elect another block chain for a hub.
But HubCoin isn't exactly equivalent to one big chain, so various optimizations and tradeoffs are possible:
1. HubCoin nodes do not need to receive individual transactions, only full blocks, so they can drastically reduce bandwidth usage.
2. Assuming that majority of transactions are settled in ChainZ and HubCoin is used as a last resort for large moves and settlement HubCoin might work much slower. So instead of confirming transactions themselves HubCoin nodes might use simplified verification instead and wait for a lots of confirmations. For example, ChainZ-&gt;HubCoin transaction would require 144 confirmations in ChainZ. It would take 24h for transaction to be propagated to HubCoin chain, but with such a large number of confirmations it will be probably even more secure than full verification by HubCoin nodes. 
3. A hybrid approach is also possible: each HubCoin node follows some set of sub-chains (possibly empty), up to its taste. If follows a chain (which costs resources) then it can include relevant transactions from that chain and embed them into HubCoin chain and get txn fees. So HubCoin nodes have an incentive to follow as many chains as possible, as long as they have resources for it. HubCoin nodes which do not follow respective chains won't know that transactions are valid, but they can use simplified verification. Or maybe they won't need to verify these foreign transactions at all and security can be ensured through higher number of confirmations required. So it is a tradeoff between speed, security and resource efficiency.

Because people have uncontrollable urges to use mesh networks? :)
Prohibition didn't work so well because 1) people were used to drinking alcohol; 2) there was no alternative.
But now mesh networks haven't got any traction yet and there is an alternative in form of commercial ISPs.
So there is very little incentive to participate in mesh network if it can bring you significant legal problems while giving NO advantages.
If you see lack of censorship as an advantage: same thing can be accomplished with anonymity networks on top of internet like Tor, I2P, Freenet etc. etc. Using internet infrastructure means that goal can be achieved with very little cost while connectivity is very good.
Mesh networks can only give an advantage in a complete shutdown situation. But to get any connectivity at all you need good participation rates, so it has pretty much no chances of getting formed unless state of shutdown is permanent.

Next best is hub&amp;spoke payment channels, which are more centralized.
And then you have ordinary payment channels, but they are between two parties only, and thus are useful only in the case of a repeated payment.

But lending on a small scale has none of these problems.


Believe me or not, but this is more-or-less how fractional reserve banking works. You just described it in other terms.
They say that fractional reserve banking creates money because people assume that money on their bank deposits is money. But you can fix it: forbid on-demand accounts and offer only time deposits. Now people can't claim they have money in the bank because what they have is CD.

No. Each bitcoin node has full history of all transactions, ever. Thus each node receives information about all present transactions. That's how bitcoin protocol works.
Nobody knows how to make it work in a different way.

There is no simple answer to your question because there is no distinct "transaction processing" action. Transactions are distributed among nodes and are verified in process, then miners combine them into block, do proof-of-work signature and then distribute blocks.
With current client software ALL transactions (in form of blocks or standalone transactions) are distributed among ALL nodes, no matter whether you're mining or not. So it is not just a problem of miners, it is a problem of everybody running Bitcoin software.
It is possible to implement a thin client which will not verify transactions on its own but will rely on miners (e.g. if it was confirmed by a few blocks then it is assumed to be good).
But if millions of people will all rely on small number of miners who do not have any formal obligations it is not good: there is a risk of collusion, or attack on these miners (or from rogue miners), or just oligopoly with exorbitant fees.
Basically, Bitcoin won't be P2P in sense people usually understand P2P. It will be P2P among big guys, and small guys will be their clients, essentially.

A problem was that software behind MtGox was full of WTF yet they did nothing to fix it for months. I've read a trade log related to that massive sell-off and I'm pretty sure that's not how trading software should work. It was processing _one_ sell order for _36 minutes_ and all this time price was not properly updated (it did not bottom out at 0.01 so people had no idea what is happening. For 36 minutes. Unless they were fetching data through WebSockets feed.)
Besides that there are NUMEROUS security problems. It is not an isolated problem, software was a quick hack full of bugs, and generally software of this quality isn't supposed to be in production, let alone handling large sums of money.
You can be sure that team which allowed this to be running for month is both incompetent and greedy.
So, I dunno, even if they say they've improved things I would take it with a grain of salt -- it is very unlikely that very incompetent team will suddenly adopt good practices.
So, yeah, it is better to switch, statistically speaking.
(For the record, I never had any business with any Bitcoin exchange, including MtGox. I'm just a software developer generally curious about things like security and these are my thoughts on what I've seen in public sources.)

'Capped futures' with full reserves are generally useful for making bets about short-term bitcoin price moves while still keeping bitcoins.
It is of limited use in case you're a merchant who accepts BTC and would like to hedge against possible price drop before he cashes out into USD: the need to make upfront reserve makes it less attractive. But if you keep some sum in BTC as a reserve you can use it for a futures contract with, say, 25% seller reserve and 50% buyer reserve, it would be better than nothing, I think. Or if you do settlements frequently (each day instead of each week) you don't need that much for reserves.
I'm planning to implement capped options next: using options you pay one-time, fixed price and enjoy protection against BTC exchange rate drops (within certain limits).
Current version is not friendly to arbitragers and market makers because you need to make individual reserve for each contract.
I'm going to fix it in the next version: if you'll have contracts going into opposite directions for a single settlement date they will essentially cancel out and you won't need to reserve for a second one. (Moreover, your currently reserved money can be freed up!)
And, finally, I'm going to implement contracts which won't need full reserves and won't be capped, but will be based on trust and insurance. Also I can implement reservation/settlements in USD (and other currencies) but only if I'll find a partner who will handle financial part 'coz I don't want to deal with official currencies myself. (Oppressive gov't etc.)

You see addresses in public information. E.g. [this]( is how it typically looks.
These addresses are not attached to people. You do not know whom a particular address belongs to.
Using a separate address is an "official" [recommendation]( for merchants and using same address for many payments is described as a [common error]( which has bad consequences.


So what? The only thing which should matter to merchant is that bill was paid -- certain address receives enough bitcoins.
It shouldn't matter how it was paid.


Well, ok, imagine that everybody sees how you spend money. That you pay to porn sites, for example. I'm sure everybody does things which he doesn't want others to know about, not necessary illegal or embarrassing. Maybe you need to buy some medication but you don't want people to know you're sick. Maybe you've donated to charity which your friends do not like. Whatever.
Then, if everybody knows it then IRS knows it too. Let's say you've bought a laptop, didn't like how it works and sold it via ebay. You didn't get any profit from it, but IRS will see that you've got $1000 in income and would want you to explain.
You need to understand that anonymity is not for cryptofreaks. Anonymity is necessary to give people same privacy levels as cash gives them. Or, say, credit cards -- while your payment processor knows your transactions it won't disclose it. But bitcoin protocol has disclose all transactions. Then we need to make sure that addresses in those transactions are anonymous -- not linked to any people.
Bitcoin with public addresses would we way crappier w.r.t. than cash/credit cards/wire transactions. So who would use this shit?


But why do you expect it to work like phones if it is not about making calls?
It is about doing transactions, so it should work like accounting/invoicing/billing system.
How would you receive a payment within an accounting system?
1. You would create an invoice which has an unique number.
2. You send invoice together with payment details to a customer.
3. You wait for a confirmation from a bank that customer have paid
4. You create appropriate transactions and ship an item.
Bitcoin client works _exactly_ like this, it just uses a different terminology.
1. Bitcoin address you generate for a customer IS an invoice number.
2. You send this address (=invoice) to customer.
3. You wait for a confirmation that customer have paid (bitcoin client shows confirmations)
4. You ship an item.
So your question about whether it makes sense to create an address for each payment makes as much sense as whether you should give each invoice an unique number.


Wat? It kinda works now, doesn't it? It isn't a huge problem to copy address and past it in you client and click "send" button, is it?
You're not supposed to type it by hand, you know.
There are no usability problems whatsoever.

Even if you forget early versions of PHP, as recent as of PHP4 they had features which shouldn't be there:
1. `magic_quotes_gpc`
2. `register_globals`
3. HTML-preprocessor mode
4. assignment makes a copy
First two were there to make making very simple sites with ease. But they gave _zero_ thought on security implications. Subsequently `magic_quotes_gpc` and `register_globals` were deprecated _after_ many sites fell victim to security woes, but some hosting providers keep them enabled to run their clients retard-built PHP sites.
Idiotic assignment semantics came there from Perl. If PHP development team had any clue about programming language design they would simply adopt same design as used in Scheme, JavaScript and Python. But no, they had Perl as a prototype so they've just copied it from Perl. It makes interpreter a bit "easier".
It didn't work nicely with objects, though, so they've changed assignment semantics for objects alone. This is a good example of how PHP's legacy affects its current state.
And they haven't fixed HTML-preprocessor mode enabled by default. Modern PHP applications have their code separated from templates and templates are often implemented in a language different from PHP, for example, Smarty.
But even if you have solely code, no HTML parts at all in your file HTML-preprocessor feature can still bite you, it can insert extra spaces, for example. And it has security implications.


Jeez, you think that IE security woes somehow justify using PHP? I would not recommend using either IE or PHP.


There are different kinds of dynamic typing: weak and strong. Basically, weak kind lets one to use strings and numbers interchangeably while strong won't. Weak typing is much worse w.r.t. error proneness and security.
I've already explained -- if you use strong dynamic typing or static typing then you'll HAVE to convert strings to numbers explicitly. And when you do this you HAVE to handle errors. While with weak dynamic typing you can just use string as a number, without any checks etc.


MySQL API is not just some API, it was pretty much the MAIN API used in PHP and many tutorials show how to use it rather than MySQLi or PDO. A lot of PHP programmers alive today are used to this deprecated API.

Really, I think people who think they can make predictions should put their money where their mouth is. This will help to smooth things out, actually.

This wiki article explains the problem and how it can be solved:
 Note that "generate infinite accounts" does not solve the problem.
If you're not a miner you need both to receive bitcoins from somewhere and to spend them.
The problem is that spend transactions include addresses you've received bitcoins to, and thus are linked to your receive transactions.
Let's say you buy bitcoins with cash and donate them to some dissident. Now if government knows address dissident receives donations they can trace history of each donation he receives, so they can eventually find identity of a dude who exchanges bitcoins for cash, and that dude has seen you in person. So government now potentially knows who donated money to dissident.
Thus you're anonymous only if you trust people whom you receive bitcoins from to not rat you out. Or you're mining them yourself.
@_date: 2011-05-29 20:55:45
It doesn't matter if it was cash or not. Let's say you've got bitcoins by selling something somebody. Now if that somebody has a forum account and have published his address on forum to get donations (many do) authorities might trace him through related transactions and ask about details of a specific transaction.
If you've sold something physical maybe they'll have your return address.
If you've sold Steam account and they know that account's name they can subpoena Valve to reveal credit card number you've paid for that account with.


Of course there are tricks to anonymize your coins and have plausible denialability.
But if you're not aware that bitcoin transactions are traceable you won't use these tricks. And if you do transactions without any precautions it might be damn easy to trace you.
Of course most people don't give a fuck. 
But if traceability is mentioned in article and it obviously matters to some people (it is one of selling points of bitcoin) it is very misleading to call transactions 'untrackable'.
They are _reasonably_ untraceable only IF you follow certain precautions.

In simple words, it is a VM implemented in an esoteric language.
Probably the most interesting part is that there is a sort of a global namespace of scarce IDs which also acts as a PKI. These names are scarce. You might need to pay to use a shorter name.
What does it have to do with decentralized computing? Well there is a messaging between these VMs, but otherwise not much.
I'm yet to see any _practical_ example. Messaging is cute but it's something people did 50 years ago and we now have a lot of encrypted messaging systems, incl. BitMessage.
These people have been working on urbit for many years, if they still haven't come up with a particular use case chances are that it's nothing but a toy. (People started using Bitcoin for drug trade in 2010-2011, so in two years it got a very concrete "killer app".)

I don't think it _always_ acts this way either, but it would be rather hard to catch them.


Sorry, but you were misinformed. This "$16 trillion" number comes from people who do not understand accounting. (Or intentionally made it misleading.)
Let's say I have just one coin and you happen to need it. I'll lend it to you for 24 hours. Then next day you return coin and ask a loan again; and we repeat this process for a year.
If you compute turnover, it would be 365 coins, but in reality it was just one coin. 365 coins never existed.
Same thing happened to $16 trillion -- they were rather small, billion-scale overnight loans which banks repeatedly asked for many days in a row.
Then again, those were LOANS, not hand outs. Banks paid them back.
What you should look at is Fed's balance sheet and monetary base data. (They are related because Fed never just hands out money: it either buys something or makes a loan.) It currently has about 2.5 trillions on balance, but it is mostly a result of quantative easening (QE), not 'handouts to banks'.
So these loans are kinda red herring. QE props up certain assets, at same time giving banks too much money to play with -- it is not healthy. On the other hand temporary, short-term loans are not a problem at all, it is what central banks are made for. (And it is in interest of the people because people definitely do not enjoy banks failing due to a lack of liquidity.)
But in any case, if that '$16 trillion' thing was a problem, where are its effects? Inflation is low, people are not suffering. What's wrong with it?


It might be alse the demand from black/grey markets and low-barrier-to-entry currency. Doing some transactions is problematic and bitcoin solves this: anybody can transact with anybody else, without any borders or barriers.
These uses are pretty much unrelated to store-of-value use.

Implementation of this version requires only a simple modification to scripts to allow hash checks. No complex handling of distributed contracts is necessary.

It does. It is called error-prone design. If some language feature makes it more likely that programmer would make an error in a program then it is a bad feature in sense it makes language error-prone.

It is a bit subjective because we need to define which programmers we consider. For example, newbie programmers will make errors regardless.

I think it makes sense to consider average programmers -- not lame, not brilliant, but ones who actually write software (typically).

IMHO PHP is too lax (it does automatic type conversion, variables are created on demand etc.) and it is error-prone. Even a good programmer might introduce a bug through a typo or a lack of review (to err is human) and it is likely that error will go unnoticed (until it is too late). And if language is lax this is much more likely.

To understand CSRF you only need some knowledge of HTTP and typical browser behaviour.
Cookies merely authenticate a _browser_, they do not provide authorization of a specific action from user. They are simply not designed to do that.

It does. Something like this: 
1. You have wallet.dat on your smartphone encrypted by a password AND a PC client key. 
2. PC client generates a transaction, it includes its key and encrypts the whole thing with smartphone's key.
3. Smartphone receives this pre-generated transaction, decrypts it, obtrains password from transaction, combines it with password user enters. (After reviewing transaction.)
4. Smartphone client decrypts wallet.dat and signs the transaction.
5. Then it sends this transaction to PC client which distributes it among  other nodes.
PC client does not have wallet.dat. If somebody steals smartphone he has encrypted wallet.dat and won't be able to use it without both user's password and a key from PC client.
This is what you get with a simple crypto, with advanced crypto you can make even better solution.

Do libertarians allow limited liability companies, corporations, etc? They make contract enforcement and private property rights pretty much useless.
Even if you allow only unlimited liability ownership fraud is still very well possible: some homeless man without any assets will be the owner, while a person who gets profits will be beneficiary of some fund who is not officially liable for anything.
In other words, libertarianism is not compatible with legal realities.
BTW this is why there are almost no bitcoin financial companies: even if you have a contract with them and you can sue them, if it is some LLC chances of recovering your loss will be pretty slim. Real banks are regulated and audited and insured, that's why they are relatively secure.
(Simple insurance is not enough: only idiot will insure non-audited, non-regulated company.)

Software behind MtGox is just one piece of WTF, so, yeah, nobody knows whether it works or not.
If I was implementing it I'd use 24h average price to gauge how much bitcoins is within $1000 limit.
I think a better approach for the attacker would be to set up a shit ton of small accounts, fund them with $$$ and then do that massive sell off to transfer coins to those accounts. Then it can withdraw $1000 from each account. Bitcoins will be obtained through trade so it gives plausible deniability.
To fund accounts in untraceable way one can transfer funds via BTC, then buy USD at market, and then through massive sell-of purchase BTC back at below market.

All theoretical models break down when you have just one entity/person controlling supermajority of resources. You cannot study that using mathematical methods. You cannot know all the factors.
So if we got to a point where single entity has tremendous influence, it's time to recognize it's FUBAR and start over.
E.g. if Chinese government orders BITMAIN to attack Bitcoin at risk of being imprisoned, it will be in their own _selfish motivation_ to comply with request.
Obviously Satoshi didn't have this situation in mind when he designed Bitcoin. So it really doesn't matter what is "fundamental core", in this particular situation it doesn't work.

IRC is just one of ways to bootstrap it in fully automatic fashion without any human intervention. It is nice because people can just run it and have it working.
But you can as well provide list of nodes yourself. If some disruption of IRC happens you can get list of notes from twitter, forum, site, github, reddit, whatever.

I'm not alone in this. tfk09's OP now has score of -11, so there is at least a dozen of people who think it is bullshit.


I said he has no idea what he's talking about, i.e. models he's using are all wrong.


Model linking monetary base to exchange rates is completely wrong, it just doesn't make any sense.
People mention _supply and demand_ for a reason.  Neither supply alone nor demand alone tells you anything about price, but a combination of supply **and** demand can be used as a crude approximation.
Applied to money supply and price levels you can see this in [Quantity theory of money](
    M * V = P * Q
Besides money supply (M) and prices (P) you also need to take into account velocity (V) and quantities (Q).
Even this equation is a very crude model, in reality monetary base is not directly linked to prices at all. See [here]( USD monetary base has tripled since 2008 yet prices (both commodities and consumer) had very little growth.
So what "same amount of fiat" are you talking about? You shouldn't be talking about "amounts of fiat" at all, as with banking system you have a number of [money aggregates]( MB, M1, M2 etc. which are constantly fluctuating.
If you want to talk about fiat money, talk in terms of price inflation levels. You can assume its value fixed as inflation for USD and EUR is pretty low if you're talking about short-term perspective.
On the other hand, bitcoins are more like commodity rather than a currency since there's virtually no bitcoin banking. So bitcoin price depends on supply and demand.


You don't need to know a lot about economics to see that this phrase is wrong since it's fairly obvious that exchange rate is the same thing as a 'monetary value'. It should be. Exchange rate is how many dollars you get per bitcoin. And monetary value is how many dollars you have per bitcoin. So if it isn't a same thing something is very wrong with your model.
tfk09 could easily understand this himself if he thought about it for few minutes, but he choose to post his idiotic comment.
If you think that a number of dollars that exist per bitcoin is of any importance, you should do a simple reality check. Current monetary base is around $2.5T, while 7.5M bitcoins are in existence. So there are about 333,333 dollars per bitcoin. Is this number meaningful in any way? I don't think so.
In same fashion you could calculate number of dollars per each apple, car, liter of water, space shuttle, ounce of gold etc. But it tells you really nothing about prices of these things. Maybe it is because dollars can be used to buy EITHER apples or cars or gold but not everything at same time? We are onto something...
So again, it is about supply and demand

Are you dense? Do you see a difference between _expressing_ and _storing_? How about _expressing_ value for _storage_?
If conversion from double-precision floats to integers is lossless then you'll have no problem storing values in doubles, you just need to be careful to **do all math** in integers. In other word, you read double, convert it to integer, do whatever you want and convert it back to double. It is weird but it will work.
If it is not lossless then RPC API is broken as it does not report amounts correctly.

Long term plans include trading on other currencies and pretty much everything you can assign monetary value to. All it needs is a reliable way to assign spot price which cannot be easily manipulated.
There are things called [prediction markets]( where you can even trade on events.
One particular thing which should be interesting to Bitcoin miners is betting on Bitcoin mining difficulty: when you buy a mining rig you invest your money and expect certain money flow. If difficulty goes too high they won't return their investment. So we can issue a [swap]( contract which will exchange a variable Bitcoin cash flow which one gets from mining for a fixed cash flow at a certain difficulty. So, essentially, you can sell your hashrate on the market and get a fixed profit no matter where difficulty goes.

I mentioned three _categories_ of use cases. This wasn't supposed to be an exhaustive list, you're assuming too much. I know many more, and then there are ones which I'm not aware of.
Other possible uses are automated payments: p2p lending, "uber", etc.


Because there are actually many cases, and we don't yet know all of them. Why not make a general framework?


You're conflating "The DAO" with a concept of a DAO. A DAO is basically a fund. "The DAO" was, indeed, misguided because it was just a general purpose investment vehicle. It was basically a show-off.
But a DAO assembled for a specific project/purpose makes a lot of sense. For example, it might be a charitable trust/organization. The point of using a blockchain for that is lower risk, higher transparency, better speed.
From a technical point of view it's like multi-sig on steroids: you can have a really large list of participants, the list can be dynamic, you have built-in communication tools, spending can be controlled by complex rules (e.g. small-scale spends require fewer signatures).
Bitcoin is just not flexible enough to implement a rule like this: "k signatures are required to spend an amount less than 1 BTC, but only one such spend is allowed per day". Is this too much to ask?


This is unrelated to your question: "What's the economic advantage to putting DAPPS on a blockchain? Nobody has been able to answer this question."
I answered your specific question. I'm not here to preach Ethereum (you can notice a week ago I've made a post highly critical of Ethereum here), I'm not here to lecture people about smart contract security.
Ethereum people are now working on formal verification. That's one approach. They are also working on improved contract languages. And then there are contract frameworks, i.e. instead of doing shit yourself you call a library function which is well-tested and well-reviewed.
Are you going to say that there is no way any of these approaches will be successful?


Actually I wrote a paper about _fully decentralized prediction markets_ which do not need to rely on oracles, thus this problem is irrelevant. But it's off-topic...


Past empirical evidence shows us that Ethereum is improving.

How so? Once you have money on a sidechain, it will be identical to Bitcoin.


What's cool about Bitcoin is that it allows you to send money to anyone without thinking about costs. E.g. suppose some random guy from Africa does an AMA, and you want to buy him a beer. You can easily do that, all he needs to do is to install an app and give you an address.
LN doesn't work like that. Obviously, a new guy doesn't have any routes, so you gotta open a new channel. Which costs money. Also, you don't know if that guy will keep his wallet online, you don't want a channel, you want a one-time payment.
So LN will force users to think: "Should I open a new channel or do one-time payment? Should I wait or pay higher fee now?". Bad UX, not cool.
Federated sidechain might be much better in that respect since its UI is identical to Bitcoin (once you're in).


I can guarantee you there will be a lot of "WTF, I have money in the wallet, but can't send it, halp!".


Why are people convinced that there is a layer which is suitable? There is 0 evidence for that.
LN have been in development for more than a year. Could they at least model UX?
Modeling UX requires no cryptography, you can just emulate it using a centralized database. Implementing something like that takes just a few days. Why haven't we seen any UX modelling?
I can tell you why: devs know UX is going to suck, so they focus on crypto parts and hope that some invention will improve UX in future.
Which means that there are zero reasons to hope that Lightning will solve Bitcoin's problems.
LN is cool for micropayments and repeated payments, but it doesn't implement Bitcoin's main function (ability to send money to anyone).

No, I did not. I'm just saying that PHP's core is haphazardly designed. Blatant mistakes which caused most problems were fixed in PHP5, but a lot of bullshit stays in place.


The point is that it was designed two decades ago but is still very relevant. So it turns out that revising a language each few years is not necessary when you do the right thing from the start.


Consider a scenario when shop starts to sell some cheap, crappy, China-made, noname products. A lot of people might buy them as they don't know that these products are crappy and they seem to be working, and then this crap breaks and people complain. Moreover, it people was relying on these products -- for example, it was a door lock which controls safety of a whole household or a computer which holds important files -- they suffer loses _beyond_ their original purchase price.
So will you say that there is a high demand for crappy, cheap, China-made, noname products?
I would say that it is a case of information asymmetry: shoppers couldn't know that quality is low. But producer did. And shop could do quality checks.
Now customers have experienced loss which refund will not cover, shop has to do refunds, and producer did not get much selling products for cheap. It is lose-lose-lose situation.
You can fix this situation through education: customers should be aware that there are products of different quality and they should stick to proven brands. Shop, again, will do much better if it would stick to proven brands. And producer should not make crappy cheap products.
PHP is popular only because people do not realize that buying cheap ends up costlier in a long term. If they would pay a bit more they could get a product which has much less chances of failure.


There are many languages which are up to the task much better than PHP. Python, Ruby, Java -- they all are quite popular and can be used to rapidly build websites.
PHP is used mostly because it is very popular among amateur programmers, while it is not a factor which should have any impact on professional, commercial website development.

What you claim is too good to be true. If you don't want to be considered crackpot you'd better have waited until you have a full description rather than just a first draft. (Besides that, if you don't have a clear description for yourself chances are that you've got something wrong.)
I'm well aware of distributed hash tables. One might use DHT to reduce storage requirements for a Bitcoin node: there is no need to change Bitcoin protocol, DHT could work as a separate layer. But it is rather problematic because it will increase bandwidth cost and reduce performance and reliability (i.e. it will create another point of failure), so it is understandable why it wasn't done.
But it's not newsworthy. DHT doesn't reduce the bottleneck -- each block still has to include all transactions made in an interval of time, and all nodes have to download full block to verify it. So DHT does not improve scalability, it merely reduces storage costs at expense of bandwidth costs and latency.
But conceptually blockchain is still monolithic.

Storing data is very different from preserving data forever.
When you publish your data on a service like Factom, you give up control -- you can no longer modify and delete it. And this is very important for audit purposes.
So this kind of a service is very different from Amazon S3 and things like that.
Suppose you keep your audit logs in Amazon S3... Then a rogue admin steals bitcoins and erases all databases, backups and logs. Now what?
Obviously, you need to make sure that logs can't be simply erased. So either you need to build highly redundant infrastructure... or use a service which is specialized in this.
Obviously, it's going to cost more than your usual cloud storage, because you pay for high redundancy (not just multiple nodes, but multiple _independently controlled_ nodes) and impartiality (taking a bribe for destroying evidence should be unprofitable, so service should generate revenue roughly proportional to value of evidence it stores).
That's not to say that Factoids are a good investment... Who knows, maybe if this thing becomes popular Amazon will enter this market with, say, T3 service and undercut prices.

How is this related to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2011-09-02 06:42:21
If you use US dollars you can use many financial products and instruments: credit, deposits, futures/options, bonds, stock trading, ETFs, etc, etc. You can play with foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices etc.
Simply using a credit card already teaches a good lesson about time value of money.
You can see how 'economy' affects exchange rates and performance of different investments.
If you use Bitcoins you can exchange them for USD, and that's pretty much all. Even if you buy something for bitcoins price is usually pegged to USD price anyway.
There are no serious bitcoin financial institutions due to a lack of confidence, no real derivative market, no speculative trading.
Either you invest in bitcoins or you don't.
So yeah, I'd say 'rossryan' is totally in middle of that diagram.
I think the possible cause is that USians see only prices quoted in USD, they are not even aware that other currencies exist and so when they learn about bitcoins they start to think.
But people who live in Europe, for example, see prices both in EUR and USD and other currencies, so they are already aware of different currencies and floating exchange rates.
Even more so people in 'developing' countries who see USD as a rather stable currency while their local currency might fluctuate wildly.
So if bitcoins teach you something you were very dumb to begin with.

Otherwise exchange rate would change.
If surplus demand (e.g. from long-term investors) for BTC is higher than 7200 BTC/day then they would buy everything what's mined PLUS something from people who currently own BTC, so price will go up as supply is limited. 
E.g there are X BTC in liquid form, i.e. available for sale, and each day S BTC are put aside for a long-term investment. Thus on day k you have (X-kS) BTC. Obviously it cannot go on forever, so price has to go up.
Same thing happens if not all mined BTC are bought, you'll have extra BTC on the market and eventually price will drop.
Of course it is just a long-term projection of first-order estimate, not accurate at all, but I think that's enough for tfk09.
But it is probably robust in a long-term, i.e. you have to consider yearly volumes for BTC mined and BTC market growth. On such scales fluctuations and higher-order effects would average out and you'll have fundamentals.
Fundamentally, a currency with a growing money supply cannot have constant value forever UNLESS its use (economy) grows at the same pace. I guess everybody here understand that. I've just phrased it in a different way.

Bitcoins might as well loose their value rapidly. Price volatility goes into both directions.
This makes it rather hard to make a deal. Employers are interested in paying not more than market price. Employees are interested in getting not less than market price for their work.
With USD you can make a year long contract easily, so employer won't pay too much and employee would be able to pay off his mortgage, buy groceries, hardware etc. Prices do not fluctuate that much within one year.
But with BTC it is like a gamble: either employer will be overpaying or employee will be underpaid (measured in what he can afford). It is extremely unlikely that contract will be correctly priced.

In this particular case it boils to a simple rounding.
Note that loss of precision in floating point calculation is possible when you add or subtract numbers with different exponent.
When you multiply or divide there is no loss of precision.


Oh, really.
As a renowned financial calculations expert, can you please explain me how to do this using integer-only calculations:
    X is an amount of USD
    Y is an exchange rate which shows how many USD you get for 1 BTC,
       e.g. in same format as you see on MtGox.
    Z should be a number of BTC you get for X USD at exchange rate Y,
       i.e. Z = X / Y
For example, X = 10, Y = 30.00000, Z = 0.33333333.
Keep in mind that many programming languages do not support big integers so you have to use 64-bit ones.
Now compare complexity of your solution to complexity of a solution which uses floating-point numbers: `Z = financial_round(X / Y)` where `financial_round()` can be implemented as `JSONtoAmount(forJSON(amount))` (as mentioned above).
@_date: 2011-06-25 22:44:46

Why Nick Szabo is unlikely to be Satoshi Nakamoto:
1. Nick has very academic writing style influenced heavily by law jargon. Satoshi is nothing like that. I'm sure people analyzed writing styles using special software and found it doesn't match, otherwise Nick would already be exposed.
2. Actual content and ideas are significantly different too: Nick tried to align his idea with legal tradition, Satoshi made no such attempts whatsoever. It seems Satoshi was more influenced with p2p networking ideas.
4. No evidence Nick is particularly good at writing code. Few code snippets he published are nothing like Bitcoin code.
5. Szabo's smart contract ideas are, again, heavily influenced by legal stuff and do not really look like code. Satoshi's Bitcoin script (which can be used to implement certain smart contracts) is a Forth-influenced VM, which is very pragmatic from programming perspective. Satoshi made no attempt whatsoever to accommodate Szabo's smart contract ideas. (Which would be weird since he spent considerable effort on VM.)
5. "Bit gold" is too similar to "Bitcoin". If Szabo tried to hide his identity he could have found more different name.
6. Nick re-posted his 2005 article in 2008. He didn't change dates, he made another post. I guess he wanted to get more feedback or find people who can help with implementation. Again, it would make no sense to re-post old post with flawed ideas if he was really working on Bitcoin at that time.
9. Finally: Nick is unlikely to be Satoshi because Wei Dai says so.
Wei Dai is cryptographer who came up with proposal of PoW-based digital cash called [b-money]( back in 1997. So among Hal Finney, Nick Szabo and Wei Dai, Wei Dai has the priority.
Apparently Satoshi was aware of b-money and sent Dai a draft of the paper for review and feedback.
As you can read [here]( Wei Dai has an opinion that Satoshi Nakamoto isn't Nick Szabo. Specifically he listed three reasons:
1. in Satoshi’s early emails to me he was apparently unaware of Nick Szabo’s ideas and talks about how "bitcoin expands on your ideas into a complete working system and it achieves nearly all the goals you set out to solve in your b-money paper". I can’t see why, if Nick was Satoshi, he would say things like that to me in private. 
2. Nick isn’t known for being a C++ programmer.
3. Satoshi’s writings just don’t read like Nick’s to me.
So I assume Wei Dai knows Nick Szabo quite well and thus he can tell if the guy he was exchanging emails with is Nick or not.

You do not need to represent things exactly, you need to represent them unambiguously. That is, there should be one-to-one mapping between all possible bitcoin amounts and a subset of numbers representable by double-precision floating-point numbers.
In other words, if you know that value stored is bitcoin amount but not some arbitrary number you can do rounding correctly.


Please give an example where rounding described on aforementioned wiki page would not work.
For your convenience:
    int64_t JSONtoAmount(double value) {
        return (int64_t)(value * 1e8 + (value &lt; 0.0 ? -.5 : .5));
    }
     double forJSON = (double)amount / 1e8;
I.e. you need to find an integer amount for which `amount != JSONtoAmount(forJSON(amount))`.

I know it's theoretically possible that witnesses will collude and start censoring my transactions, but I estimate that probability is not bigger than a probability that Bitcoin pools will start censoring my transactions.
There is no mechanism which prevents Bitcoin miners from engaging in censorship via a soft fork, it's all honor-based. Same thing with BitShares, it's honor-based. But at least BitShares gives us a possibility to oust out asshole witnesses through re-elections and/or a hardfork.

A better question is: What "DAPP" use cases are relevant?
I think best candidates involve (1) escrow of value (i.e. value is held in custody by "the contract"); (2) payout done according to some rules.
So potential use cases are:
1. DAOs, i.e. people put their money into a pot and then control how it's used
2. prediction markets
3. derivatives (e.g. stable-coins)
There is certainly a demand for these kinds of things.
Now back to your question... First, let's note that Bitcoin allows users to escrow value and control payouts, but in a way which is limited and/or clumsy and inefficient.
Let's consider a prediction market example. They usually need some connection with reality. So suppose that the settlement outcome is decided by 100 oracles. 
Nominally, you can do that using Bitcoin: just put funds into N-of-M multi-sig, say, 70-of-100. But there are problems with this approach:
1. it is an efficiency nightmare, as you gotta need 70 signatures for each payout
2. you also need a market, so you need to develop a separate blockchain (federated sidechain, for example) for that
3. it's not very secure, as oracles can collude to straight out steal all the funds.
Now let's compare this to Ethereum:
1. oracles sign outcome just once, this can be memorized by the contract (as it's stateful, this is what Bitcoin Script lacks), then payouts have minimal overhead
2. a market can be implemented in the contract itself, no need to develop a custom blockchain
3. oracles can choose a wrong outcome, but they cannot right out steal the funds, so an attack is more complex
Thus Ethereum can potentially provide better security, better efficiency with much lower development effort needed. This is pretty economical, if you ask me.
Note that generally Bitcoin people agree that (1) prediction markets are interesting; (2) trustless prediction market require a blockchain. But they (e.g. P. Sztorc) are trying to implement it using a sidechain. This is a technicality: if your main chain is general and efficient, you don't need using "sidechains".

$16 trillion number comes from GAO report on Fed: 
On the very first page: 


Peak shows, basically, how much money came into existence through this thing.
Page three (of the PDF) shows per-program peaks and outstanding balance. (So, yeah, loands were returned, mostly.)
Number "16 trillion" comes from table 8 on page 144 of PDF (page 131 of the document), title say "Institutions with Largest Total Transaction Amounts (Not Term-Adjusted) across Broad-Based Emergency Programs(Borrowing Aggregated by Parent Company".
"Not Term-Adjusted" means that it doesn't take loan terms into account, basically they are comparing apples to oranges. Like, we have 1 apple and 4 _baskets_ of oranges, so 5 items total.
On the next page you can see term-adjusted values, they make more sense. Total is $1.1 trillion, which matches peak value I've mentioned above.
The fact that first number being widely publicised, not the second one, shows either crass misunderstanding or malicious sensationalism.
In a same way there is [Bitcoin Days Destroyed]( metrics which shows bitcoin transaction activity. Generally it is quoted in percents, as raw values have no meaning. But some idiot might get raw bitcoin-days-destroyed number and yell "there are trillions of bitcoins in circulation! wake up sheeple!".

Then you should treat it as an investment, consider risks, diversify, etc. Blindly moving everything to bitcoins is not rational.
Even if bitcoin is a great investment in the long term, converting everything to bitcoins might be not a great idea because in short term: fees, spread and volatility would cost you a lot. 
E.g. if you've got some dollars and you're planning to spend it on groceries tomorrow, doing it through bitcoins will cost you:
1. fee to move $$$ to exchange
2. spread+fee to buy bitcoins
3. day volatility risk
4. spread+fee to sell bitcoins
5. cash out fee
6. credit card fee
Simply using greenbacks looks much more rational.
This is why rational people/companies hold assets with different liquidity: generally, assets with lower liquidity are more profitable in a long term, but more liquid assets have lower costs. So one might have pocket money, current account, savings account, investments into short-term bonds, long-term bonds, stocks, gold, real estate. He wouldn't sell his house to buy some groceries.


If you're doing it for fun then it's ok. But I think people who treat currency as some fun thing do not really help it.
For example, during real estate bubble people bought houses because they thought it is cool, without a proper analysis.
This reckless investments hurt these 'investors', other people who actually could buy a house, but price was too high, and economy in general during a crash.
So I'm just saying that it is not healthy. IF many people do like you they will prop up bitcoin price in short term, then bubble will burst at some point and bitcoins would be abandoned. OTOH rational use would lead to organic growth without subsequent crash.

No, it's not.
If you buy stocks at random, that's gambling.
If you take a calculated risk by betting on a financial instrument you understand, that's investing.
Bitcoin price in future isn't really random, it's just very hard to predict. While nobody knows Bitcoin price, say, 2 years from now, many people can see a certain trend.
So if this looks like gambling to you, that just means you're clueless.
In gambling, expected value is usually negative, i.e. you're going to lose money on average. In investing, people bet on something which they believe has positive expected value.

I very well understand that 'thin' clients are possible. 'Simplified payment verification' is described is Satoshi's paper so he envisioned this too.
What I'm saying is that prohibitively high costs of running a full node will make network less secure, reliable, convenient and affordable, and thus less competitive.


Yeah, we hope, but hope is not enough when, for example, billions of dollars will be at stake.
There is a huge incentive to collude -- money. And unless you know mechanism which counterbalances this incentive betting on absence of collusion is naive.
And for a large business which depends on bitcoins bet would be too large.


Yes, this is one of counterbalances. But I'm afraid it won't hold against multi-million dollar incentives from the one side, and from the other side at the target 2000 transactions/second rate EFF and Wikileaks won't be able to afford. 50 cores for verification, 1 TB/week in storage (and that should be fast storage like RAM or fast random access flash), 1 GB/s in traffic... This shit is damn expensive. Maybe EFF and Wikileaks could afford it if that was their main thing, but they have other things to do...
It shouldn't be a problem for big guys like Amazon or Google, though.


I don't think so. This service has same bandwidth and storage requirements. Mining requires more CPU power, but CPU costs will be dwarfed by bandwidth and storage costs.

I was considering effects on exchange rate rather than profits of investors.
Basically, you can try to explain change in exchange rate as a sum of contributions of different factors, such as money inflow/outflow, investor moods etc.
Then having this model you can do more accurate predictions and risk analysis, as you can, presumably, estimate how much contribution of each factor might change over time more clearly than you can estimate exchange rate directly.
For bitcoins we can identify factors like this:
 * inflow/outflow from normal economic activity
 * new people acquiring bitcoins to enter bitcoin economy (or just out of curiosity)
 * speculation
 * miners cashing out
Now we can estimate each of these factors, at least on 'hand-waving level'. 
If bitcoin economy isn't growing significantly and bitcoins are used mainly for payment facilitation you can expect that normal economic inflow and outflow cancel each other: i.e. people buy bitcoins with their $$$ to pay for services/goods, spend them, and then business owners sell bitcoins to get $$$ to pay for goods/salaries/etc.
Situation is a bit more complex if businesses who accept bitcoins for payments would also spend bitcoins (i.e. paying salaries in BTC), but if it is stable they still cancel each other. (But growing economy will grow somewhat faster due to this internal spending.)
If media hype have already peaked you won't find a lot of new people purchasing coins to enter the bitcoin economy.
So you have essentially two factors working in this, presumably, stable period: speculation and miners cashing out. Later is obvious, and for the former we need to further break them into categories.
Long-term speculators who just hold coins as a form of savings and hedge affect exchange rate only as their enter the scene, and later their contribution is neutral.
So if we're considering a stable period we need to consider short-term speculators, 'day traders' and such. If these short-term speculators get profits (and I would guess they do, as they can profit off unsophisticated people who need to sell/buy bitcoins right now), it matters whether they accumulate those profits in bitcoins or USD. In the later case, they would be contributing towards decreasing exchange rate.
So we can very well get into situation where other factors mostly cancel each other or are neutral and we have exchange rate at hands of short-term traders.
I would expect that those short-term traders do not really give a fuck about bitcoins in a long term, so they just cash out USD and enjoy life.
And bots are just short-term traders which are market-making or arbitraging and generally don't give a fuck about long term predictions. So bots can do this in large volumes, thus accumulating sizeable profits...
This is mostly a qualitative analysis, then you could get trade data and estimate how much USD they take.
I would guess that miners cashing out is much bigger factor (IIRC it is around $1.5M USD per month), so it doesn't make sense to blame it all on poor bots. But if you're making bets on bitcoin price moves, it's better to check that too.
Also, it's worth noting that bitcoin is more vulnerable to this problem (or 'factor', if you wish) because it is often used just for payment purposes and so is frequently exchanged. If more bitcoin payments were internal exchangers/traders would take a smaller cut of the overall transaction volume.

Moreover, through blockexplorer I can probably reveal more details: I see other transaction between them.
I see addresses which belong to Falkvinge. Now I can potentially trace other Falkvinge's addresses (as client usually uses multiple addresses for transaction) and thus I can estimate how many bitcoins he currently has, I can see addresses of people Falkvinge have received money from and addresses of people whom he's sent money.


It will be used again when that person purchases something. And then we can probably go though the chain and deduce what he have purchased.

Wow, this log reveals all kinds of WTF.
So, as I understand, information about this sell order was public and people knew that there is sell 500 000 @ 0.01 since 13:15:36, right?
But somehow it was not reflected in ticker. I would expect that large sell order would instantly wipe all bids and ticker would reflect this dropping buy price to 0.01. 
But no, it looks like they have some slow matching feature which would show dropping prices for about half of hour.
Another WTF is that some prices are strings, some are floats.
It looks like about 200k of that sell order were sold by 13:50, and Kevin just bought the rest of it. So it is very unlikely that he is connected to attacker.
@_date: 2011-06-21 12:57:21
There is discrepancy between their stories: Kevin says that he got first because he set price higher than others. MtGox owner seems to imply that he was first because he was an attacker.
And also there is a video of order log which shows that there were many trades (or orders) at 0.01 and the last one was the largest (250+k).
So what we need is a log of orders/trades and explanation for 0.0101/0.01 discrepancy. (If Kevin puts 0.0101 order would MtGox round it down to 0.01?)

It is possible to implement it as a web service + some out-of-band auth too: user splits his private key into two parts, one part is kept on a local PC and another is uploaded into a web service.
When he does a transaction client asks a web service for a second part of private key and web service reveals it after doing some out-of-band authentication: for example, sending a text message with a transaction pwd to a user's phone. User receives message and types password into his PC client which then uses it to retrieve second part of private key and sign the transaction.

Cause is obvious: when more people use bitcoins it both increases number/volume of transactions and increases price/demand -- for new people to "get in". (Or existing bitcoin users use bitcoins more heavily.)
But, of course, there are other possible causes for higher number of transactions, e.g. there might be a massive pay off when some service is closing, theft or just a hoax.
No matter how smart you are you can't tell the real cause from numbers alone, you need extra information, such as, maybe, number of active users on bitcoin exchanges, balances they own and so on.
So unless you have some extra information to analyze simple correlation is the best you can do. (Together with trends and stuff like that.)
I think people often confuse best with ideal. NOTHING is ideal in this world, but it doesn't mean you should just sit on your ass and shout "correlation does not imply causation". (I'm not arguing with you but with commenter above.)

2. `magic quotes gpc` was a disaster too and they admit it.

3. PHP was used mostly with MySQL, but the first MySQL API did not have anything like query parameters, so it required escaping strings (see `maginc quotes gpc`) to avoid SQL injections. But it is hard to do escaping in the right places so it led to awful numbers of SQL injection vulnerabilities and shaped PHP's reputation. Note that if you use query parameters SQL injections are not possible by definition.

4. See above -- extremely bad security practices just few years ago.

So I don't know how it is possible to have a worse reputation aside from making it vulnerable intentionally.

Note that reputation is something which needs to be earned. If security practices would suddenly ideal that doesn't mean that people would start to trust PHP after all this bullshit which was happening years ago.

Public bitcoin addresses are used only for donations. To receive payments from people (for example, for goods you sell) you should create an unique address for each individual payer. Otherwise it's a mess, for various reasons.
Implementing name system only to be used for donations doesn't make a lot of sense.
Same thing can be achieved through a browser plugin: a web site which accepts donations will add some additional meta-tag or link-rel to its HTML. Then plugin will notice it and will show a donation button. Look-ma, you can donate to any web page which is bitcoin-aware!

Yup. But CSRF has everything do to with lame web developers.
PHP is a programming language which is used almost exclusively for web development. So if you make a site with PHP chances are you're a web dev by profession.
And I think that web devs by profession should be well aware of CSRF. If he is not then every site he makes will be prone to it. Basically, each HTML form is prone to CSRF unless you take protective actions.
So it is a shame. I'd understand if those were people doing Java GUIs who went on a short gig to make a BTC exchange -- they would have some excuse.
But if your PHP site has CSRF this probably means that you suck badly at the only thing you know how to do.

Either you're assuming some protocol extensions or you do not understand how protocol works.
As far as I know there is no such thing as saying anything about a block. If node finds block invalid it just rejects it and forgets it. If waits for a different block.
So it is rather hard to prevent other nodes from accepting a block -- basically, you need to break communications among them. Or you need to present an alternative block and spread it faster.
But even if attacker successfully replaces block generated by some other node with his own ... nothing bad happens. He is just delaying transactions by one block in the worst case.


Yes, but it is somewhat mitigated by sub-chain blocks being reinforced by main-chain blocks.
OTOH this makes main-chain more vulnerable to fracturing.

Yes, it can.
Fractional-reserve banking is just a fancy term for borrowing money from one people and  lending it to other. It can work with any kind of currency.
 It is called 'fractional-reserve banking' because people who deposit their money think that now they have their money in the bank, while in fact they just own a bank's promise to return money on demand, not money itself.
A problem with gold and bitcoin banking would be bank runs -- there is no central bank to help with this.
It won't be a problem if banks are healthy and small. Well, if you pick a bad bank it's your problem.
But if 'bank money' is a significant portion of GDP there is a systemic risk -- bank run is pretty much inevitable at some point.
So if you imagine a country or a whole world without fiat currencies large-scale fractional-reserve banking would be a huge problem in that world.
But it is probably better with bitcoins than with gold because it makes little sense to keep your coins on demand account -- you can be your own banker. So if you're only interested in time deposits, and it is easier to allocate reserves for time deposits.

They claimed that the problem was that they didn't demand enough confirmations. Then there were double-spends, and so they should be able to demonstrate bad transactions and/or blocks.

But I think it is not unbelievable, it is inevitable. Bitcoin is fully digital currency, so it depends on digital infrastructure. If they are profitable attack WILL be INEVITABLE.

There were no attacks while it was a game among similar-minded activists, but when you have exchange with $50+k daily turnover, people who would like to profit from it through DDoS and other attacks will come sooner or later.

We need to be prepared. So I think it is good that it came sooner rather than later and from a member of community rather than from an external malicious hacker.

DDoS is rather weird, though. MtGox is written in PHP, right? At least its owner has "PHP can do ANYTHING" in his forum signature.

PHP is full of bugs, it is one of crappiest languages.

So if it was me I'd try to hack the server. Unless they have multi-layer security (which is unlikely, I think) if you break in you can get maybe 0.5M BTC if you break in.

And unlike 'real money' bitcoins are anonymous so it is much easier to steal them and avoid being found.

[Here]( is a proof that newbie-level C programmers are committing to the official PHP's CVS repo (in 2007, PHP was plenty popular and used by serious site at that time).

Note that this newbie was trying to fix serious security vulnerability which potentially can lead to arbitrary code execution (thus pwning the server) and his fixes were publicly available for about a week, so malicious hackers could see these commits and craft an exploit which attacks this vulnerability.

(Checking if `size &gt; INT_MAX` makes absolutely no sense in C because int is guaranteed not to exceed `INT_MAX` by design. So I hope you understand what level of programmer this was.)

[Here's]( a view on how PHP security response team works from the inside. (Read bottom of page 1 and page 2). Basically, dude who understands good security practices founded have founded the PHP Security Response Team, but unfortunately other PHP developers still did not take it seriously so he had to resign.

This describes situation in 2007. What they had is a pile of C code, written by amateurs (Rasmus Lerdorf, the founder of PHP project admits himself that he is a pretty bad programmer and the rest of the team seem to match him in skills), NOT checked for security, thus full of bugs.

Firm isn't selling bitcoins to user, it is re-filling the device. It is an entirely different thing.
For regulators, the concern is that bitcoins can be used for money laundering or that payment card will be used illegally.
Refilling a dedicated hardware wallet which user can't access is an entirely different thing, it can't be used for money laundering.
It can work the same as buying in-game currency from app store. Nobody cares about it because it can't be used for money laundering, so it's super easy to do that.

Hmm, I remember a similar post recently, where user said he was able to send $$$ to his account and sell them, but was unable to withdraw bitcoins.

Um, can you show me your computations?
We're attacking 160-bit hashes of public keys as it is enough to generate a keypair with same public key _hash_ to grab the money.
Let's say there 2^40 outstanding coins (about 170 coins for each person living today, not unreasonable). Thus probability that each guess is successful is approximately  2^40/2^160 = 2^(-120).
If one CPU core can do billion operations per second (GHz scale frequencies) then you need something on scale of 2^120/2^30 = 2^90 computer-seconds to get something. If you're willing to devote 100 years to cracking you need something like 2^58 CPU cores to do this.
That's a lot, but you say age of the universe... And you can probably make optimizations specific to ECDSA+SHA256+RIPEMD scheme.
(Math is way off here but I guess it shows that it is at least theoretically possible.)

1. PayPal needs to cover their ass for the case when login and/or credit card was stolen.
2. PayPal has to work with credit card transactions and credit card company itself might try to cancel payment. (On customer's claim that card was stolen, purchased goods were not shipped etc.)
3. It is against VISA and MasterCard rules to accept payments forl any cash-like things using cards (to make stealing harder), and so PayPal's official position is that you're not supposed to buy/sell bitcoins or other digital currencies using PayPal -- you'll be violating ToS.
In other words, you want PayPal to be a completely different kind of service.
Credit cards and paypal are generally perceived to be secure, but this security comes from its limitations.
There is already an entity which allows you to pay anyone for anything -- it is called a 'bank'. Send money using online banking (offline banking works too) and that would be it, but somehow people are reluctant to use it.
One of benefits of having network of exchangers is that it can enable wider use of local bank transactions. And large exhangers can settle among themselves using international bank wire.

Maybe simple third-party arbitration would suffice? Say, all players 'pledge' their funds via a transaction. Then, after the game, a third party (poker site) will release a code (or a signature) which would allow that transaction to be spent by the winner.
Third party can't get money, fraud is possible only through a cooperation between players and the site. Somewhat more sophisticated version might require consensus among players: e.g. if two players _and_ the site agree on outcome money can be spent.
See "distributed contracts" on the wiki.
I also proposed a simpler version which requires hash code instead of a crypto signature, maybe that's easier to implement.

I made the first colored coin implementation (2012), first atomic coin swapping with colored coins aka p2ptrade (2013). I now work as a CTO of ChromaWay, we published a lot of open source software which you can find here: 
Probably most interesting are:
 * chromanode: Bitcoin blockchain indexer, quite like Insight and electrum-server, but with a difference that data is stored in PostgreSQL and it supports queries which are relevant for wallet synchronization
 * blockchainjs: a chromanode connector for JS, includes SPV support
The rest is colored coins specific, but with cc-wallet-engine or cc-wallet-core you can create a simple Bitcoin SPV wallet in like 10 lines of JS code.
[Cuber wallet]( is based 100% on our open source libraries. I believe it is the first bank-issued money on the Bitcoin blockchain.

It is stable on scale of years. BTC isn't stable on scale of hours. Quite a difference.
Moreover, slow but inevitable inflation isn't a problem for a currency: just take it into account in your contracts.
High unpredictable volatility is a problem, though.
And once again: currency is not designed for long-term storage of value. Prices WILL fluctuate, nobody can give any guarantees. If you want to be safe invest in multiple diverse assets.
But if put all your money into account which does not yield any interest (or yields interest lower than inflation) and then whine that you're losing money you're just a pathetic idiot.

Investor are not supposed to 'spend' their money, they might want to move to faster appreciating assets. Maybe gold, oil, stocks, etc. If there is demand for it then there will be people who will trade this things directly in BTC (perhaps for some premium).
Imagine anonymous, 'black market' stock exchange with all trade solely in bitcoins. Quite makes sense for some people...


If there will be no legal problems merchants would appear once there will be a demand. Otherwise it would be crazy -- opportunity exists but entrepreneurs do not use it. Why?
The question is: is there some value in bitcoins so a person might prefer it to other forms of payments?
Apparently there is some. We can extrapolate it from use of other digital currencies.
Then if there are people who are willing to buy with bitcoins there will be merchants who will sell for bitcoins and so there will be some demand for bitcoins. And thus people will be able to convert their savings in BTC to buy something which is not sold for BTC.
But note that demand comes not only from merchants. There is a considerable volume in person-to-person trade, auctions like ebay etc. Bitcoin might get popular in that area. There is also a huge gambling market, poker and whatnot, and bitcoin really shines here as it solves anonymity and legality problems at same time being hassle-free. There is a market for illegal stuff like drugs. Porn. Digital goods. Game money/items. Etc. Etc.
Bitcoin is perfect or nearly perfect for many things, so the question is why they wouldn't want to use it, not why they would.
As it is a new thing there are a lot of concerns about security and reliability, but at some time it would be considered a proven thing.

Yes, but you still need to think whether you should donate and how much you're willing to donate. It is order of magnitude more hassle than upvoting something on reddit.

Then there is a chicken-and-egg problem: there are maybe a few dozens of sites which accept bitcoin donations while there millions of sites which do not. So you'll be donating very rarely.

If it is about charities and stuff like that then you don't even need a protocol, they'll advertise what they accept and you'll be donating a serious sum directly through bitcoin clients.

But thing I'm talking about is for encouragement of wide range of content producers without carefully considering each donation. I upvote lots of sites each day so if I'll donate even just 0.01 BTC each that will be quite serious sum monthly. Hence sub-cent donations, aggregation to avoid fees and automatisation.

My rationale, however, is not to become rich quickly (although that wouldn't hurt too), but I think there's too much money in BitCoin and it hurts hobbyists. CPU mining doesn't work anymore; you cannot pay with BTC without thinking how much USD you're loosing, especially if you think it is going to a appreciate. (So maybe you're loosing thousands if you pay just one BTC...)

You're mining bitcoins and have no bitcoins? Something doesn't add up.
Or you're selling everything you've mined? But what's the point then?
(If you did not notice my site works entirely with BTC, no USD required. It is especially good if you're bullish -- you keep your coins and make bets at the same time. This way you can grow get more bitcoins without mining them.)
But ok, if what you say is true you're indeed putting your money where...
@_date: 2011-06-21 15:20:26
Ok, let's say you put a buy order at $0.01 per BTC. This means that you're buying BTC for $0.01 or less. Not more than $0.01.
E.g. if there are orders to sell for $0.01 per BTC they will match. Orders to sell for $0.005 per BTC will also match.
If there are no matching orders order goes into order book.
MtGox says that trade happens at price of order in order book. E.g. if there is buy order in there and somebody places sell then actual trade will happen at 0.01. This was on MtGox web site.

You first need to give customer a quote, then he pays, and then you have money. It takes at least few minutes and price can move in this time. You can handle it in a number of ways:
1. Pre-arrange BTC sale on exchange, i.e. you execute sale before getting BTC from merchant's customer. But there is a situation where customer does not pay. You either need to cancel transaction, then exchange counterparties will be pissed off and they will price this into  higher spreads to cover potential loss. Or exchange will take a risk, then it will have to use fees to cover the difference.
2. Exchange itself acts as counterparty, for example, being a market-maker. Then again, it either needs to price the risks of providing this service either in spread or in fees.
So again, TANSTAAFL. No matter what you do you cannot get rid of a risk for free. SOMEBODY has to take the risk, and he will demand a premium.
Also note, that if this requires a separate exchange then it is likely to have less liquidity than other major exchanges, thus having higher spreads. If it uses MtGox then it will have to pay MtGox fees _in addition_ to spread.


Now take a look at the spread, genius.
Current quote from MtGox: High:8.87 Low: 7.53. This corresponds to ~16% spread. Of course, you'll be using low price to quote USD price because you're selling BTC. But if we think that fair price of BTC is in the middle -- 8.2 then this corresponds to 8% premium.
In other words, goods you sell are 8% more expensive to cover the spread. How is this different from jacking up the price to cover CC fees? Except that CC fees are lower than 8%.
Yes, there are times when spread is lower, e.g. some time ago BTC was traded in 7.66 .. 7.76 range. It is 1.3% spread. Add it to withdrawal fee and you get 2.3%, it is on same scale as CC fees, so is it worth the hassle?
And what do we do in times of volatility, stop selling? Sell at jacked up prices?
Thing like this _might_ be possible when we'll have liquid futures and options markets. Then we'll know how much risk costs. For example, merchant or merchant payment service will purchase options/futures and will be able to offer fixed price in BTC for some time.
@_date: 2018-04-04 07:25:37
No, the original transaction replacement logic was designed for things like payment channels (which Satoshi called "high frequency trading"). This is why there's nSequence -- it's purpose is to identify which version of transaction is newer.
The idea is that parties can make a non-final transaction (with nLockTime in future and nSequence = 0) and then can produce new versions of it by signing transactions with higher nSequence.
Then transaction replacement logic is implemented in such a way that a transaction with higher nSequence replaces a transaction with lower nSequence.
If it worked reliably, it could be used to implement Lightning Network in much simpler and more reliable way.

It's not just the first mover advantage. A lot of companies​ are choosing Ethereum because they are aligned with the community. They see a committed, professional team which is very open-minded, welcoming and pragmatic. And a community around it aligned with the vision of building the better internet.
There is a downside, of course: compared to Bitcoin, Ethereum devs and community might appear as carefree and naive. But that's actually OK from startup perspective since startup is a high risk venture anyway. 
Rootstock doesn't have energy to build a vibrant ecosystem. They just aren't people who inspire confidence and enthusiasm.
There's also money aspect in it: people who invested into Ethereum understand that it's not about money, it is about building the dapp ecosystem. So after they got spare money after ETH price growth, they are eager to invest into dapps.
On the other hand, bitcoiners are much more reserved.  Many were already burned by scams and became cautious. Others just are skeptical and would rather HODL. And finally people who are adventurous probably already invested into dozens of altcoins and dapps and aren't holding their breath to put money into RSK dapps specifically.
So IMHO the network effect won't matter as much as the community effect, at least initially.
Ethereum has enough capital to pay for the very best talent, it currently can pay more than top venture capitalists can pay.
It's not like Bitcoin currently lacks tools for token issuance, we had them since 2014. (So Bitcoin actually had first mover advantage here, but as Peter Thiel says, it's usually worse than the last mover advantage.) biggest ICOs happen on Ethereum for a reason.

Yep, at least with kind of futures I have (I guess they would be regarded as kind of unusual).
Another way to look at it: each futures contract consists of buy and sell legs which might have different payoff functions (of a spot price). 'Option' can be seen as a weird futures contract where one of legs is a flat line.
This kind of unification will allow market makers to cover options with their futures.

Yes, this is possible, in theory. Service owner will publish a list of votes with addresses. Users of the system can check whether 1) their votes were accounted for; 2) no false votes are associated with their addresses.
Service owner might also add false votes from addresses which do not belong to users of the system. So we'd want to check him, e.g. pick some votes at random and demand him to reveal signatures. He is supposed to warn users that signature will be revealed.
So this could work, but verification is a major PITA, so this is highly impractical. And it can't be decentralized.
I think a viable approach is to use auxiliary keys which are used only for message signing, but are linked to main keys. This is possible even if user's wallet cannot make any special transaction (so embedding data is not an option).
Here's a simple scheme. Suppose there is an app for signing messages, it could be just a web page.
1. the user generates a new address in his normal wallet and gives it to the app
2. the app generates a new keypair public key of which commits to user-provided address
3. user creates a "sendmany" transaction which sends a tiny amount of bitcoins to app-provided address and the rest to his new address
4. this transaction serves as a proof that user wants to link his main address with an auxiliary address generated by the app
5. the app now can use the key to sign messages
This isn't 100% foolproof because in theory a user might be tricked into linking his address to somebody else's aux key, but it's really far-fetched and is quite avoidable.

It depends on how you see the purpose of BitCoin.

If you consider it as a number of cryptographic algorithms and protocols then this structure is good as a backing storage for currency which guarantees scarcity and provides means to clear transactions. But nowhere it says that end users should use it directly.

Moreover, it is inconvenient for end users _by design_ as it takes considerable time to confirm a transaction and so its direct use is limited to cases where you can wait 20-30 minutes, so I doubt you can buy something on the street with bitcoins directly.




Yes, a centrally-managed currency backed with bitcoins. Like e-gold was backed by physical gold.

As people trade in relatively high volumes on MtGox I don't see it as a huge problem. _Any_ kind of trade requires some amount of trust (i.e. product is shipped either before or after transaction is made, so there is always a window where one party can fool another), so I don't see how it is a fundamentally bad thing.

There is also a compromise solution -- you would hold your bitcoins in a private crypto wallet, but transfer a portion of them to a clearing house to do small scale transactions. Then if clearing house goes rogue you would lose only a tiny portion of your savings. But network would benefit from small transactions being settled internally.

You forgot one thing: speculation. People make bets on how much value bitcoin will have _in the future_. Obviously, bitcoin mining process is factored into these price expectations.
It actually makes sense to be concerned about "~1.5 million a month", but a question should be not "Are we printing too many bitcoins?" but "Isn't bitcoin price too damn high?"
E.g. if bitcoin price will go back to $1 per coin, it would be just $216k, it isn't a lot, right?
So if you have an abstract interest, there is nothing to worry about -- market will correct itself. It already went from $27 to $5, which proves that prices was too damn high for growth observed.
If you have financial interest, then find 'fair' price and short it if it is too high.
So what's your problem, bitch? I'm referring to this part:


You are talking like an idiot. Period. It's not something that can be argued. it's just a fact.

PHP is 
1. hastily made language
2. with dev team known to be not very good at security (on multiple occasions they've just ignore security threats)
3. with weak dynamic typing, forgiving syntax and other features which make programming in it very error prone while enabling programmers to hastily build web sites
4. with iconic mysql API (now deprecated) which is extremely prone to SQL injections (say hello to magic quotes gpc!)
So I'd say there is some correlation.
If Facebook was able to make their site secure it doesn't mean you will be able to do this too, because they could afford to build complex tools (like PHP compiler) and make code reviews using top engineers. You won't be.
And note that Facebook isn't a financial site. I've read about their internal practices and it looks like they think it is ok to break things for a number of users, testing it live and then fixing. Maybe this is ok for a entertainment site but it won't be ok for a financial site. 
So I would advice to use something like Java if you want to make a financial site. It is much harder to make broken site in Java. You can't throw few things together and expect them to work: you need to actually learn frameworks and stuff. Then there is a compiler which does basic sanity checks. You cannot just get value from a web form and use it as a number: uou need to explicitly parse it as an integer or as a float and to handle error in case it doesn't represent a number in given format.
So static typing will make sure you won't forget small things -- it will remind you.
And don't forget that to err is human, even best programmers make errors. So if matter is serious use type-checked language for fuck's sake!
If you absolutely want a dynamic programming language try Python. At least it is strongly typed, so if you forget to make a conversion it just won't work. Use a framework which already incorporates best security practices so you won't be like "WTF CSRF" when somebody have already stolen 10,000 BTC.
IIRC at least three major bitcoin exchanges made using PHP had CSRF vulnerabilities, while, as I said, a good framework would handle this for you, you don't need to do anything aside from not being an idiot.

Actually I have pretty good understanding of sidechains, after reading the paper and all that stuff. I don't think there is a mechanism which prevents miners from stealing bitcoins which aren't their: sidechain miners can produce an invalid block which assign all bitcoins to them, and then withdraw that money via an SPV proof. Since it's SPV proof it cannot tell if block is valid or not.
I find it quite worrisome that SDL doesn't know this.

If it is cold and you use electricity for heating you can as well mine some bitcoins for free :)

According to [this table]( you can easily achieve 0.1 Mhash/W on CPU. (It depends on what your idle power consumption is, BTW, it is not taken into account in this table directly.)

According to [bitcoin generation calculator]( one Mhash generate block (50 BTC worth for now) in 4590 days on average. Which is 0.000454 BTC/hour, which is `conv_rate * 0.000454 USD/hour` where `conv_rate` is USDs paid for one BTC.

OTOH to generate 1 Mhash you need to spend `0.001 / efficiency` `kW*h` of electricity (where efficiency is measured in Mhash/W) which costs `cost_of_1kWh * 0.001 /efficiency` USD.

You'll achieve break-even when `conv_rate * 0.000454 = cost_of_1kWh * 0.001 /efficiency`. Solution for `conv_rate`:

    conv_rate = 2.20 * costf_of_1kWh / efficiency

Solution for `cost_of_1kWh`:

    cost_of_1kWh = 0.454 * conv_rate * efficiency

Assuming efficiency 0.1 Mhash/W (CPU) you'll break even when 1 kWh costs 0.12 USD.

If you check electricity prices ([here]( and [here]( you can find that CPU mining might be profitable in some countries/regions.

Only retards deal in absolutes.
Security is a subject to trade-offs, like everything else. There is no such thing as absolute security, so one should choose trade-offs which are appropriate for his applications.
For example, if want to store your savings, you probably want the best security. Likewise, if you accept large scale payments, you need the highest security.
But small scale vendors need a security level which is just _good enough_. If a system works flawlessly for years, but it is _theoretically_ possible that some sort of a conspiracy will lead to a disruption, it's good enough for them. But they care a lot about convenience and speed of confirmations.
If system breaks every day then it's not good enough, obviously.
So again, it's not like people don't care about security at all, they just don't _need_ perfect, or theoretically-the-best system for their day-to-day stuff.
Custodial wallets aren't good enough, as there were both cases of outright theft (mybitcoin.com, inputs.io) as well as cases of freezes and unnecessary hassle (Coinbase).
But I haven't heard of people having problems with Ripple, Stellar, BitShares, Litecoin, etc. There were glitches here and there, but Bitcoin had them as well. Are they so bad they are unusable? I don't think so.
I certainly would not recommend people to keep their life savings in BitShares. But these systems might be good enough for small scale payments. And, empirically, they are more secure that inputs.io.

I like the idea, but I'll be a party pooper here:
1. Residential internet plans usually forbid sharing connection outside of household. And commercial plans cost more. Reason for this is very simple: ISPs know that residential users use only a tiny fraction of available bandwidth, statistically, while commercial one use more. That's why they provide fast connections at low cost.
2. Even if you have a great deal with ISP to get fast connection for cheap it is still isn't a bright idea because it might bottleneck at router hardware. And good routers costs more...
3. ISPs will minimize number of hops, while mesh network won't. And that will have an disastrous effect on latency. Even more so if wireless (wi-fi) is involved -- it won't be usable for VoIP and gaming, only for large file transfer where latency doesn't matter.
4. It might be more fault tolerant w.r.t. total connectivity loss, but with lots of poorly maintained and cheap hardware it will have high packet loss, so expect large delays while packets are retransmitted.
5. If authorities want to block network access they will simply outlaw such things.
6. If somebody does something unlawful on the network and he uses you connection then you'll be subpoenaed or even arrested. I'm not sure if ISP protection laws applies to individuals who officially are not ISPs. There are multiple cases where people running Tor exit nodes were burned and Tor project recommends AGAINST running Tor exit node at home.

It applies only to consensus over the longest chain. 50% attack cannot change the rules, it cannot steal money, etc.
If some miner temporarily gets 75% of hashpower (e.g. other miners suffer from major outage), he can wreck some chaos, but his control over the system remains limited, and, importantly, system goes back to normal.
On the other hand, "once we reach 75% we change the rules" is a very different thing. Like very, very different. It is a safety mechanism, but it can fail.


Yes, I did, 5 years ago. Since then I implemented several Bitcoin wallets and wrote several academic papers about cryptocurrencies.

Exactly. Kevin says that he put his 0.0101 order AFTER others had lots of 0.01 orders.
If MtGoX would show us log of orders made right before and after attack they would either show us 1) either that Kevin is wrong (and then he might be the hacker or a person who knows hacker) or 2) he is right and then MtGoX owner is a douchebag who threatens honest traders with FBI just to avoid liability.
But they show log-in log which shows exactly nothing, so it looks like (2) is the case here.
I also hope that other people have records of order log and would be able to confirm or deny MtGox information.

I think MagicalTux just threatens Kevin with FBI and other FUD to prevent Kevin from claiming ownership of that 250k BTC sum.
It can be seen from [logs]( that Kevin placed his buy order **36 minutes** after huge sell order was made, and after half 500k sum was bought by others, so he is clearly not associated with thieves, he is just a lucky trader.
As he got this money in a honest trade he could try to claim it through litigation or, maybe, through putting pressure on MtGox.
FUD was meant to cool off people on forum.
If this is true and MagicalTux was knowignly spreading FUD he is a huge scumbag.

Bitcoin isn't better.

No. The problem is a lack of rigor. Gavin doesn't bother to put his reasoning into a coherent article which can be reviewed, but instead writes a series of a cheerleading posts.
Particularly, Gavin seems to imply that there is some way to split the validation work between nodes. If that's true, it would be awesome, as it can solve all the scalability woes. All Gavin needs to is to describe these method, security assumptions he makes, etc. But that's where article ends.
I've been thinking of a way to split validation between nodes for ~4 years. I don't think it's impossible, but it _does_ change security characteristics. We need actual research in this area, not remarks in blogs.

People in OTHER COUNTRIES use dollars for settlements, willingly, simply because it makes sense.
Fluctuations of value are small, there is a huge market with lots of liquidity, thus spreads are low. This is all people want from currency.
A rational person, not a religious nutjob like you, DOES NOT FUCKING CARE how it works in a long term because he would exchange dollars for something else. Maybe local currency, maybe gold, maybe food.
It only matters how much value changes within payment/contract period, like a week, month or so.


Let me guess, you're a libertarian nutjob living in USA, you work only with dollars and it is boooring, you want some other currencies, as exotic as possible, so you dream about gold, bitcoins and such.
I live in Ukraine and I work for a company in Sweden, so I need to receive money from them. We cannot transfer either of local currencies (UAH and SEK), at least not without a huge loss because of spread on exchanging, so we use third-party currency, EUR in this particular case. It just works, we did not have to re-negotiate rate in four years, euro is stable enough.
But it is only a part of a problem, when I receive euro I have to trade it for a local currency due to ass-retarded local regulations. Then I need to choose what to purchase, because UAH is not stable at all, I need to buy dollars, euros, gold, stocks or something.

The point is that you should boot LiveCD dedicated to bitcoins. It should just run a network stack, encryption software and the bitcoin client.
This a lot smaller surface for attack -- basically, bitcoin client itself, as network stack is usually pretty secure -- comparing to a regular OS install which runs a shit-ton of applications.
Vulnerability of ANY of applications would means that system can be pwned and bitcoin can be stolen.
But simply using Linux already gives you much better security simply because there are less readily-available exploits for Linux AND Linux distros provide security updates to ALL supported applications, not just OS components.
While in Windows each application is on its own. Many of them have their own updates, but users perceive them as nagging and do not do updates.

(Sharing huge blocks is much easier when you have a deterministic block-building process, it can be O(1) when only transactions acknowledged by all players can enter the block; but block pre-sharing might be done within a closed network, so other participants will have to use highly inefficient full block transmission mechanism.)

In fact it is very similar to the sidechain scheme which I described back in 2011 [1]( [2]( and I still think it makes more sense than the original sidechain proposal from Blockstream people.
The Blockstream paper doesn't describe conditions which are necessary to have a secure and robust PoW-secured sidechain. I think in practice it requires cooperation among the majority of Bitcoin miners, and at that point it makes sense to use the actual SPV or even a soft fork as you described.

It does not need to. Technology will enable certain entrepreneurs to make things which were previously impossible. Then majority (or some significant portion) might want to use these things because they are better/more profitable/fun than alternatives.
If you have read Asimov's _The Foundation_ you might see that we might be in one of crises: many things have changed due to new technology developments (or are on the verge of changing), but current ruling elites do not want the change. Bitcoin might be a thing which will help to enable and accelerate the change by bypassing rules of existing elites. To be clear, I don't think that bitcoin is the best thing ever, but it might be one of a number of necessary things.


Why? There are bad stories about everything. For example, internet hosts all kinds of crap like child porn, fraud, it can be seen as enabling extremism etc, etc.
Yet people are still using internet. Because it is goddamn convenient.
If bitcoins will provide huge advantages they will be used despite all the bad reputation. It all depends on balance between reputation and benefits one gets from using a thing.


You say it like it is a bad thing. Are you a communist by any chance?
If people who make use of a new technology get rich it is only for the good.


I think you need to discern getting rewards from dominating upon others.
Getting profit definitely DOES NOT mean that entity is going to do less-than-ethical. If you think this way you're an extreme communist. Are you going to burn all for-profit enterprises to the ground?
Of course domination and coercion can be seen as bad things, but so far there is absolutely no evidence for them in context of bitcoins.
Note that fairness has absolutely nothing to do with a long-term viability of bitcoins. What matters is whether somebody will be able to create artificial barriers to entry or otherwise hamper the progress. 
Of course we might get into a situation where one will, but I believe there always will be ways to circumvent this.


My country of residence does not allow citizen to have any assets abroad (such as ownership of a company, bank account, accounts receivable) without a permit. Doing business internationally is a huge PITA unless you're a big guy who can afford to pay for lawyers, licenses, bribes etc. So I simply cannot do a lot of things legally, for example, AFAIU it is not quite legal to get profit from your site using Google AdSense _even if_ you're going to pay taxes. How is this not ass-retarded?
And I think ass-retarded shit like this needs to die.


Well, I meant escape from unjust rules, mostly. But if you ask...
Is listening music for free piracy? It is essentially a same question.
When you engage in business worldwide it doesn't make sense for any particular country to get cut on your profits.
Taxes are supposed to pay for thing you get from society/government for free. I think it is fair when you pay taxes proportionally to benefits you get (incl. indirect benefits of not seeing sick and uneducated people around, for example).
Solution which makes sense is when you pay taxes on the portion of your income which you use locally. E.g. if you're rich man who owns a company at some time you'll need to withdraw some money from your business to pay for house upkeep, food, cars, etc, etc. It quite makes sense to pay taxes on that portion of income. But I don't see why country of residence should fuck with international business which is absolutely unrelated to it.
The only connection between things I do and country I live in is me typing on a keyboard while being physically in this country. I don't see how this justifies the claims. And bitcoins allow to break this unjust connection, among other things.


It doesn't change things for brick-and-mortar businesses, aside for better anonymity for their clientèle (but nothing different from selling things for cash).
But you can sell physical things and escape need to deal with financial authorities by selling them by mail.


I'm not quite sure about that, BTC as a technology just fills the void: a currency which is not controlled by a single entity but instead is controlled by a consensus among its users. This is possible mathematically so it exists.
BTC as a project might have other goals, but those are just opinions of some people, not necessary relevant to what actually happens.


As long as there is no evidence of this misconduct it is just a speculation, not a real problem.


Maybe it is. But it is going to resolve certain forces within a global society, I think.
So I see it as, inherently, neither good nor bad, just inevitable.

I'm talking about countries outside euro zone...
Like after collapse of Soviet Union, we had obsolete soviet roubles and local currencies (karbovanets) which were pretty much unusable due to high inflation. (By high I mean millions percent a year, not 4% you 'tards are used to.)
Local currencies were rammed down our throats, but we used US Dollars and Deutsche Marks. Just because it was a rational thing to do: these currencies had stable value.
Local governments had to ban use of dollars. Then they had to bad simply denominating prices in dollars, even if final settlement was done in local currency. People switched to pricing things in "conventional units", where each unit was around one dollar. IIRC gov't tried to ban this too.
People did that because USD is a great currency. They could peg "conventional units" to gold, but gold isn't as good as a unit of exchange because its price fluctuates due to market forces, it is not controlled.
They could even use gold for settlements because soviet people had some gold (jewelry), like 10 grams per person. But they used USD because it is more convenient than gold.
And I'm fairly sure that there were no agents USA and Germany who enforced use of their currencies, it was a rational choice made by people and businesses. Free market FTW.
I see you responding with typical talking points: state, force, ramming down the throat, bail out, welfare. Can you please stop regurgitating libertarian propaganda for a minute and think a bit?
People who had choice to use pretty much anything, because it is illegal anyway, choose dollars and euros/DMs. Can you explain this? The only possible explanation I see is that dollars are actually great as a currency. Either that, or alien invasion.
I'm not saying that it will be a good currency 100 years from now. Probably it won't. But 'fiat currencies' were working fine for decades.

If attack has no tangible effects it's not an attack.
Suppose that reputation system is used for purchases, and there are too many fraudulent purchases from Samsung phones (compared to LG ones, for example). Then merchants can ban Samsung phones, or increase prices for them. In any case it will affect Samsung, so there is an incentive to not do that. (Also, is Samsung going to do that to defraud merchants? Why?)
On the other hand, you're proposing using an inefficient and fragile system just because existing one (PKI) is not 100% perfect.

I'm a programmer and from what I've heard and seen it looks like software behind MtGox is piece of shit not suitable for production.
It is one thing when security vulnerabilities are caused by rare bugs in code, and completely another thing when they are caused by negligence and disrespect to common practices.
1. CSRF: Every form in every web application is by default vulnerable. Thus any professional web developer should be aware of CSRF problems (otherwsie EVERY application he works on will be vulnerable) and should take corrective measures. Which are simple, by the way: just check goddamn referrer! So if you see CSRF somewhere then either this is a sloppy coding or sheer lack of professionalism.
2. SQL injections. They are not officially confirmed by MtGox, but people on [irc]( claim that there were SQL injection problems (SQLi). This, again, shows that developers are lame because SQLi is a very serious issue but it is easily preventable: if you use parametrized queries/prepared statements and never modify queries themselves then SQL injections are simply not possible at all.
3. Same thing XSS: if you use a templating engine like Smarty in PHP then XSS is not possible because it will 'escape' everything automatically. Naked PHP is very vulnerable, but people should know they are not supposed to build sites like they were 10 years ago.
4. It looks like their trading software sucks. I've looked through a websocket API log at time of that large sell-off. Oh my... Yes, there was one large order to sell 500k BTC. I would expect that it would instantly fill it with existing bids (&gt;= 0.01) and show current price with 0.01. But, now, it was slowly filling that huge-ass order for 36 motherfucking minutes, and it was not showing that 0.01 is the current price, so people had no idea of what is going on. (But this information was available through websocket feed.)
5. Normally exchanges have automatic 'circuit breakers' -- if price goes too low trading automatically stops. If that was a case with MtGox we would have none of the mess if it would halt right after filling that huge-ass order: it would be easy to undo the damage and people would have no chance so withdraw.
6. It was reported that withdrawal limit (no more than $1000 worth of BTC per day) was not properly implemented: a) you could withdraw more if you would do it many times per day; b) it takes current market price to estimate threshold for bitcoin withdrawal. If there is no smoothing/averaging it is vulnerable to 'large sell-off' attacks.
7. Looking through websocket feed logs I've noticed that prices are sometimes represented as floats and sometimes as strings. E.g. `0.01` and `"0.01"`. This means that there is some weak-typed fun going on inside and it can be a serious source of bugs. I think that weakly typed languages like PHP SHOULD NOT be used for financial software. Ideally it should be implemented in strongly and statically-typed language like Java.
8. In their official announcement they said that account balances were very wrong. This indicates serious bugs or SQLi at work.
So it was not an isolated incident, software is simply full of bugs and is written in a sloppy manner. Any half-competent team would not allow software of this quality to be used in production: they would stop site and bring it back only when it is fixed.
Thus it looks like team behind MtGox is either extremely incompetent, or greedy, or both.

@_date: 2015-11-22 22:47:06
It might work for things like micropayments, but if we consider Bitcoin becoming a mainstream currency and people getting salary in Bitcoin... People are generally paid once per month, so you need to support at least one month of trade volume to avoid publishing transactions on the blockchain.
So to support usage from 100 million people earning on average $2000/month we need 200 billion dollars in capital.
Thus I really doubt LN is the ultimate solution to the scalability problem.

So, whose problem is that? PHP is an immature, amateur programming language used together with immature, amateur database engine.
Lack of support in bindings is not an excuse. They could implement query parameters themselves -- parsing query string, escaping and pasting parameters. As PHP already has string interpolation it would quite fit. But instead they implemented fucking magic_quotes_gpc.


I'm well aware of PDO and MySQLi. As I said, a problem with them is that preparing statements does not make sense in language like PHP because you have to prepare them only to be used once (unless you execute query repeatedly, which is pretty rare).
PostgreSQL supports parametrized queries without preparations, in one go, on protocol level -- but PHP programmers somehow have a natural affection towards MySQL.


magic_quotes_gpc is more like a misconception. There is no single way to escape a string, you escape it in a certain context: for example, for HTML, for SQL, for URL. The idea that you can just escape string automatically is utterly idiotic.
As I said, if PHP's authors weren't idiots they would implement automatic escaping of query parameters.
Later they've recognized this and deprecated magic quotes.


If language's authors had a bit of understanding of security they would recognize them as bad ideas immediately.


That's a problem -- it was not designed for what it is used now. For example, a spare space after your library file's code will be printed into HTML page. WTF?


Unless you run them in CGI mode printing stuff is not related to what goes into a HTML page. But in PHP it does, even if you use Smarty.


Don't you think language can somehow attract idiots?
PHP is deceptively simple. You can do a web site with 'template' in PHP itself, `echo`, and `mysql_query()`. Many tutorials will refer to these things. So people who master these things think they can make sites.
And then it turns out that these things are not related to making professional quality sites at all.
You wonder where 'idiots' come from?
OTOH if you're learning, say, web programming Ruby, I bet you will start right from Rails, not from CGI bullshit. And Rails is a real thing it can be used for web sites.

I'm afraid you're confusing futures with options. They are different beasts.
Options are asymmetric -- one party pays a fixed price and other pays depending on situation. (In cash-settled case.)
Futures are kinda symmetric -- one party sells and other buys. One party has to pay if price goes above, another if it goes below.
It doesn't cost anything to make a futures contract, you just need to find a party which takes other side of the deal.
For example, if futures price is 10.00 and reference spot price at time of settlement is 10.00 too. Then neither party pays.


It already has an API -- client is implemented in HTML+JS (no server-side dynamic code) which uses JSON-RPC API from server. You can make bots or alternative UI right away.
There is no API documentation, though, but there is a SMD file which lists all API calls. (And as it is alpha version API might change...)


Unlikely so, we have different kinds of contracts. (I'm planning options too some time in future but probably they will be different from what BitOption does.) (I did futures first because option pricing is a complex topic, futures are easier to understand/work with.)


Hopefully, when there will be a significant number of trades.

Not really. You've probably read it in some old and misleading article.
Average users aren't supposed to mine currency, they should get it from exchanger or through selling things.
Miners are nodes which process transactions, ensuring network security and protecting from double spends. They are awarded with bitcoins for their hard work.


It is now impossible because there is too much competition in mining.


So it wasn't that hard, right?


If they cannot do it themselves then they either should pay to one who can or they should buy ready coins.
If everybody was only mining there would be no economy. But now it is easier to get coins by selling something and that's how economy gets bootstrapped.

This is not true. PHP itself is relatively bad from security standpoint because large portion of code is written by amateurs who are not experts in C.
Than, as you probably know, versions 3 and 4 had gaping security holes built-in: register_globals and magic_quotes_gpc.
But even now it is much less secure than other options (like Java) because it is weakly dynamically typed and has many features that can make code error-prone.


XSS can be easily prevented by properly escaping stuff which goes to HTML. PHP is error prone because you can just `echo $str;` while in other language you would use a proper template system which will do escaping automatically, no chance to fuck up.


I think you meant SQL injections... They can be easily prevented by using bound parameters, but the original PHP MySQL bindings just did not have bound parameters. That's why early versions of PHP had `magic_quotes_gpc`.
Even now it is less than perfect because PHP is used mostly with MySQL which allows to use bound parameters only with prepared statements, which do not make much sense in PHP. So while more secure API is available I bet some people still use good old `mysql_query()`.

It's not a new idea, it's mentioned from time to time.
The major problem with it is that you have to do security trade-offs if you do sharding. 
E.g. if you just break one big blockchain into N smaller ones, then each one gets only 1/N of the total hashpower, and thus they are weak. So that won't work...
There is a number of tricks you could use (merged mining, fraud proofs, etc) but it's clear that security assumptions will be different.


I think it actually requires an invention, so not "surely". You cannot predict when it will be made.
But I think more people should do research on this. It doesn't seem to be fundamentally intractable.
@_date: 2016-10-08 10:19:20

@_date: 2011-08-09 12:35:45


Do you understand what you said yourself? Please think it through, write down steps.
You said previously: "Customer pays in BTC,"
This means that he needs to know amount in BTC, thus you need to provide quote in BTC. 


Exchange can sell BTC only after it receives BTC. Note that this process takes a while.
MyBitcoin.com claims that it was robbed because they required only one confirmations.


It does matter if BTC is involved on any step.


Then you just add fees/spread to the price. Again, it is not different from jacking up the price, except customers will see how this is inefficient and they'll be pissed off.
Also it seems that you mean that BTC-on-MtGox account will be sold for USD-on-MtGox account. I don't see why bother with BTC at all: just use USD-on-MtGox for settlements.
In other words, you'll just create another USD payment system which is illegal and not secure. But has low fees. Great accomplishment.

Bitcoin works as long as nearly everyone is using the same protocol, that's a fundamental assumption. If one user alters his client he can only screw himself. But if a significant number of users will start using an alternative client, the system will basically fall apart as payments won't work reliably.
Thus "blockchain democracy" is a bad idea. People shouldn't vote for ideas by using clients which implement alternative protocols, that will only result in chaos.


LOL, what? An idea is just an idea. It is something which can be a base of a proposal. There is a lot of interesting ideas, but quite often even authors themselves do not advocate immediate development.
Even proposals aren't implemented right away, usually authors publish them for further analysis, and they become implemented (and, later, adopted) if it is found that they don't have significant flaws and are beneficial.
But proposals involving changes to Bitcoin core protocol are a different thing, if we do a backward-incompatible update we need to make sure that everyone is onboard as a "partial" update can essentially screw everyone.

It's not easy at all -- you gotta coordinate UASF in the meatspace. You need meatspace consensus before you achieve software consensus.
To activate UASF in practice you need an alliance between miners, merchants and users. That's not easy at all.
There is no "emergent" automation of any soft: you gotta talk with people.


Because EC in practice means "I will accept any blocks from miners". I.e. you delegate decisions to miners.
Sure, some holdouts can send AD to a very large number, thus rejecting blocks above certain size. But that's not how EC is supposed to be used, that's not EC. That's just a way to get normal non-EC behavior when running BU.
And, of course, a minority of nodes opting out of EC by setting AD to, say, 9999999, won't make any difference.
BU is unlimited by default, it takes a lot &amp; coordination among users to make it limited.


Setting EB is not rejecting blocks, it is _temporarily_ rejecting blocks. Miners don't give a fuck about your temporary blockage. EB matters only if you set AD to infinity.
Miners do not care what percentage of users rejects their blocks, all they care about is whether exchanges accept them. So user's voice doesn't matter unless you have all major exchange on board.


Nodes have a power to change things only if there is a strong consensus among the supermajority of users. (Economic majority and all that.) I.e. pushing changes via a "node power" is an extraordinary thing.
But UASF and EC have different goals:
 * in case of UASF, it will take extraordinary effort to increase block size
 * in case of EC, it will take extraordinary effort to protect against miners sending excessive blocks
Sorry, I don't want Bitcoin which require extraordinary effort to protect against miners.

LOL. I personally implemented a Bitcoin wallet which uses a completely different network-level protocol.
What you're talking about are changes in the consensus-critical parts of the Bitcoin protocol, i.e. changes in _currency_ protocol, not _network_ protocol.  Since they affect every Bitcoin user, they need to be reviewed very broadly. Such changes aren't something some team can decide internally.
If some fucktard just releases a client with modified consensus parts, I'll interpret that as being clueless. If he goes around promoting his client, I will interpret it as an attack on Bitcoin.
But anyone can start discussion about changes. E.g Sergio Demian Lerner recently made a drivechain proposal.


When there is no visible split in the community, basically.


Yes, Gavin &amp; Mike have polarized and radicalized the community with their ridiculous proposals and behavior. There were always people who were principally against hard forks, but I think a compromise could be reached.

This is just how this kind of research work: if we consider ill effects, we need to consider what is theoretically rather than practically possible.
E.g. if you're analyzing security of an encryption scheme you deviced, you can't say "no software currently on the market can crack it, thus it is uncrackable". If it is a serious research, you have to assume that adversaries can spend years on research and development of software and hardware which can be used to crack it.
Think a bit about it: if we consider a policy which will be in effect in the next 10+ years, do we even care how it works today?
For the record, I completely agree with Greg: when miners cooperate, they can transmit blocks of arbitrary size using fixed-size packets. They can do so by synchronizing their memory pool contents. This isn't exactly a new idea, it is also a basis behind Gavin A.'s work on IBLT.

This is not true. [Money supply]( can be measured in variety of way.

For example, monetary base is essentially all the stuff issued by the central bank: notes, coins and bank reserves on accounts in the central bank.

But M1 and M2 aggregates include also 1) demand deposits people/companies have in banks and 2) other types of deposits. While they no longer represent money central banks control, they better indicators for what is happening because people can use demand accounts in banks as money.

Next relevant thing is [quantity theory of money]( which provides a link between money in circulation and price levels. It turns out that amount of money in circulation is just one side of the story, another is velocity of money, i.e. how fast money is changing hands.

What this equation tells us is that if velocity drops prices will also drop even if amount of money in circulation stays the same. You can see this during recessions -- money do not suddenly evaporate, of course, but people buy less things and businesses do less transactions on bad expectations, so according to this equation prices drop (deflation) which cause further downturn (it makes sense to do less transactions). That's why central banks inflate money supply during recessions -- to compensate for falling velocity of money.




Where did you get this from? It is definitely not an amount of 'physical' dollars (including 'electronic' dollars in the Fed) because Fed's balance sheet is much smaller.

So you're taking into account demand deposits in banks, it seems.

I see no problems with your calculations aside from that you're assuming there will no banks for bitcoins but you take into account 'USD banks'.

It doesn't even need to be banks. Any kind of short-term debts would do it too.

Hmm, I've never traded at MtGox and I don't know how they handle fees. But I guess anybody who traded will be able to tell:
1. Do they round 0.0101 to 0.01 to handle a fee?
2. Or they will add fee to price, so 0.01 order becomes 0.0101 order?
3. Or they use original exchange rate for transaction and subtract fee after it, IOW fee has no effect on exchange rate. (That's what I would expect.)
Kevin says that he put number 0.0101 explicitly. So his story is true only if (1) is the case.

There were many centralized digital currencies, but, as far as I know, they all failed unless they were pegged to USD (or some other "official" currency). So I don't see why SolidCoin would be different, it looks like P2P is just a disguise for a centralized currency.
MAYBE it is possible to make a centralized/decentralized hybrid, e.g. through limiting what centralized part can do or allowing "elections". But from what I've read it looks like SolidCoin's maintainer is an asshole who wants to have a full control so it isn't a case here.

Ethereum software is designed in such a way that it can accept input from non-trusted users. It performs cryptographic checks to rule out a possibility of manipulation.
Databases are just not designed like that.
You can, of course, take Oracle, and then add cryptographic verification code, define transaction data format, validation rules, replication code, consensus layer etc.
But at that point you're essentially re-implementing Ethereum, what's the point?
It's much easier to take Ethereum and change consensus layer than to implement everything from scratch just to have a different consensus layer.

Another way to estimate it is to assume that investment into hardware is roughly proportional to coin market cap. (Actually it's better to calculate net present value of coins which are yet to be mined, but it is proportional for coins with similar schedules.)
 * Bitcoin $ 4,853,774,059
 * Litecoin $ 137,077,554
Litecoin is 35 times small. This is remarkably similar to 38x estimate I calculated in other comment, but that's probably a coincidence. But I think the order of magnitude is valid. (That is, 300x or 3x would be wrong.)

I said anything about sustainable model?
There is no such thing as 100% security, it is a matter of scale: how likely attacks are and how much does it cost to make an attack (i.e. do you need some custom coding or off-the-shelf tool would do).
As a rule of thumb, if there are 'anti-virus scanners' commonly used for an OS then it means that attacks are very likely and COTS tools are available. And then it is fucked.
As for a sustainable model, I think there is a fundamental difference between, say Windows and Ubuntu: all supported software installed through official repositories is automatically updated on Ubuntu, while on Windows software updates are a duty of individual software vendors which means myriad of different update boxes which many users choose to ignore and some software not updated at all.
And patched software is less suspectible to attacks.

I'm not talking about whether bot is good or not (I agree that bots like this generally provide liquidity, reduce spread and help to stabilize prices), I'm just considering a long-term effect.
Consider a closed market with just three participants: A, B and C, and fixed amount of money, say 1000 USD and 1000 BTC.
Now, let's say, B does not believe in long-term viability of BTC asset, so he just aims to collect USD. And if A and C are dumb, eventually B will gets its profit, which is $500 USD, for example.
B withdraws his USD from circulation, so now they are trading 1000 BTC but only 500 USD. So we can expect that BTC price will go down as it is not "backed" by USD on exchange.
If B continues to be successful, he will eventually suck all USD from this exchange, so BTC will appear worthless.
If bot chooses to accumulate BTC, the opposite will happen -- it will suck all BTC out of market and so price of remaining BTC will go up.
So it doesn't matter how exactly bot (or trader) works, it only matters whether it makes profit and what currency it accumulates.
Same thing happens with open market with more participants and inflow of USD and BTC. It only matters on size of bot's profits relative to inflow/outflow. E.g. if bot makes $10 a week while traders bring only $5, you get the idea.


Yea, now I understand why people say that HFT hurts the market, I previously only thought about liquidity and price moves, but now I see that if it is profitable then it sucks cash out of market, bringing prices down. It is essentially a price other traders pay for their inefficiencies.

It does. Security vulnerabilities are usually corner cases which were not considered during program design. They never occur in a normal course so programmers just do not look at them unless they are paranoid.




So? If MtGox would be pwned that won't have big impact you think?




And they require extremely good understanding of the language and a paranoid mindset.




I don't buy this shit. Debian had that famous OpenSSL vulnerability for two years (IIRC) until it got noticed. Despite it was open source and everything. 

(Again the problem was that maintainer tried to fix whatever imaginary problem he thought it has without reading the source code. If he would at least read it he would notice that thing he was trying to accomplish could be done through `-DPURIFY` and so there was no reason to mutilate the code. This shows perfectionist/pragmatic distinction very well -- OpenSSL sort of worked, but it wasn't secure. In general I think "works for me" attitude is a plague and it should be reserved for personal hobby projects.)

You do not understand security. You do not understand that ONE bug is enough to pwn a system. One bug is one too many. It doesn't matter how many bugs are fixed -- it matters how many unfixed and discoverable exists.

Understanding security requires paranoid thinking. If some theoretical remote possibility that something can go wrong exists then it must be fixed.

And it is better when problems are not possible by design, it is the only way to be sure.

Then how do you explain people using euro? It is not connected to oil or gold.
I'll tell you why -- it just makes sense. Both dollar and euro have relatively stable value and are highly liquid.
If they cease to be people/companies/governments will dump them, plain and simple.
I could, in theory, use CHF, which is partially backed by gold, but due to lower liquidity spreads would be higher so I'll lose more money on exchange. But if something will happen to USD or EUR I will switch to CHF or whatever will make sense then.
Again, it has nothing to do with oil, gold or guns, it is just about current behaviour of currencies.
If you look at WHY dollars and euros are rather stable, then yes, it is oil, taxes and international trade. But these reasons are not relevant to ordinary business people.

Who holds bitcoins when they are "swapped/traded"? Who supplies foreign currency, how?
I think it's easier to use bitcoin in non-deliverable forward (or futures, options) contracts settled in bitcoins. Essentially, you make a bet on currency moves and get profit or loss in bitcoins.
I've implemented a prototype of service like this and I know a couple of similar project.
Biggest obstacle is that bitcoin does not support escrows on protocol level (yet?) so holding large amounts of collateral becomes problematic.
But otherwise I think you're right (in a different way, though), bitcoin has a potential as a currency of an anonymous prediction market where people can be, among other things, on currency moves. But only if it will have some solution for secure escrows.

Don't forget defaults -- part of X - Y difference goes into compensation of loss on defaults, and only the rest (if something is left) into bank's profits.
For 'real' banks only a small fraction of loans default (because defaulting has serious consequences to borrowers, up to a legal action) and thus banks can maintain relatively low interest rates.
But for bitcoin bank... Anonymous loans just won't work as only idiots (economically speaking) will return them.
Whether non-anonymous loans can work is a question. Bank which loans in BTC won't be able to use commonly used instruments (credit ratings, collector agencies), and it is not certain whether legal action would work (WTF is BTC from legal standpoint?). Even if it will work, how does it interact with deflation? (E.g. borrower might be requested to return loan in USD rather than BTC.)
And bitcoin bank making loans in USD exposes itself to exchange rate risks (i.e. deflation) and thus it won't be able to give competitive interest rates.

Yup. Remember that 'financial crisis' thing in 2008 where huge investment banks went bust? Every armchair economist was afraid of dollar collapsing, but instead there was deflation, dollar's value went up, oil prices went down etc. People started talking about 'deleveraging'.  Few crackpots like Peter Schiff continued to talk about 'hyperinflation'.


Why does dollar go to shit?
'US defaults' means that US Treasury will default on its debt obligations, e.g. bonds. Bond-holders would suffer, everybody will try to dump them, interest rate will go up.
But US dollars have absolutely nothing to do with US Treasury debt. They are not even issued by Treasury, they are Federal Reserve Notes. They are just notes, pretty much like bitcoins, not attached to obligations of any sort.
So, if US Treasury defaults USD value might as well go up. I guess nobody can model the situation accurately.
There is one link, though, it is the Fed. If the Fed will try to save Treasury by buying its debt then there will be inflation, or even a hyperinflation. This is what will happen in a long term if US Treasury will continue to borrow more and more.
But if we talk about default this means that US Treasury won't borrow more money (that's the whole point of default). This rules out situation with the Fed buying debt and fueling hyperinflation.
So at least there is NO obvious link between default and hyperinflation.
Again, nobody knows what will happen. Maybe the Fed will start buying debt even after Treasury defaulted in some clever scheme. So it can inflate, it can deflate, nobody knows.

No, miners are in a different category. Strictly speaking, we are talking about demand: miners need to sell coins, so they care which coins are in demand.
But most people buy coins through companies, so it matters what those companies decide.

The difference is that the _old Man_ worked through oppression and coercion, while the _new Man_ works through market forces. For some people it is a huge difference.
It is sort of hard to coerce a person who uses anonymous cryptocurrency because, well, you don't know who he is: transactions are not linked to real world identities.


If you don't like it use something else. Other exchange, trade with other people OTC, trade locally.
You can even create your own exchange. It is sort of hard, though, because exchange has to use old money which are controlled by the old Man.
But if your financial service uses only bitcoins (or others free currencies) there is no barrier for entry. I know because I've built one. I didn't have to pay anyone (aside from normal hosting costs), I didn't have to sign any contracts, meet regulatory requirements etc. I just launched a piece of software and -- BAM -- service is working.
There is one caveat, though: individual or a company still has adhere to regulatory rules of his country of residence or country where he does business. But bitcoins change that too: these rules cannot be enforced unless you reveal your real identity (and even then it is rather hard to prove anything). You do business on the internet, all over the world.
I guess it will be even better when bitcoin economy growth: I envision "data center havens" in regulation-free areas, proliferation of business in offshore zones etc. Maybe stuff like seasteading can help here.

1. It makes no sense to mine on existing supercomputers, they are not designed for it. You need dedicated hardware or GPUs.
2. Just as anything, mining is an investment, I don't see why GS would jump this. Mining is not supposed to be very profitable, it is just a temporary thing.
3. You underestimate resources which individuals have. Yes, one person cannot compete with GS. But there are lots of people. GS has 45B yearly revenue. It is equivalent to about 1 million people with 50k yearly salary. If each one buys appropriate hardware and starts mining.
4. GS isn't the only smart company, if they will see it profitable others will see it too. There are companies who have much greater financial resources. (GS is not the largest, it is just one of smartest and most aggressive.) Particularly, companies which have technical expertise have an advantage: they can build dedicated mining harware which is much more efficient than off-the-shelf solutions and use it themselves rather than selling it. There are private companies not for sale. As a public company GS cannot engage in particularly risky and adventurous business.
5. Some company or gov't can use its resources to attack currency with some sort of DoS attack, possibly just mining more than others and not including transactions from others. But I guess people will find a way to deal with it. It is not profitable in the long run.

Waiting for a confirmation might take time, but it's not always necessary. E.g.
1. when you trust the sender
2. when you think that double-spend is statistically unlikely
3. when you punish the sender in case of a double-spend
4. when you can obtain a confirmation by other means, e.g. a 3rd party will guarantee the payment success

Barry is talking about SW+2MB HF, but what does this mean? SW can be blocked with as little as 5% hashpower. Barry cannot control all miners, so his talk is just an empty talk if he just voices support.

Centralized systems like PayPal and federated systems like Ripple have numerous advantages over Bitcoin, including network effect. But I choose to support Bitcoin rather than PayPal, not because I'm certain that Bitcoin will win, but because I believe that decentralization of control is important.
It is cute that 21.co have chosen to work with Bitcoin instead of issuing their own currency, and this can be seen as a positive thing. However, I don't think we should applaud an attempt to build a closed garden on top of Bitcoin.
It is true that it might benefit us in the short term as Bitcoin will get more attention. But it's clear that they're trying to build a closed ecosystem with vendor lock-in, and this isn't something I cannot stand behind. In the long term, it will compete with the open Bitcoin ecosystem: in the post above, Balaji made it clear that he wants developers to use their specific hardware and software. So a developer who could otherwise work on Bitcoin projects (trust me, it's actually easy without a "Bitcoin computer"), he will contribute to the 21.co ecosystem.
They aren't even trying to make an open standard or anything like that (which is now very common in the tech field: software is open, protocols are open, but company monetizes additional services and features), it's a blatant, deliberate vendor lock-in. Fuck this shit.
I see nothing wrong with a company offering a centralized service. E.g. if 21.co was just offering a centralized micropayment service and/or a marketplace with built-in reputation and anti-Sybil systems, it would be nice. But closed-source software, proprietary hardware and vendor lock-in is exactly the thing we were fighting with.
Big companies like Google, Microsoft and IBM are embracing openness, but now we're getting same old shit from a Bitcoin startup, I don't even.

You simply didn't understand the information which cointape shows.

minrelaytxfee is an anti-spam parameter. It's not like it was re-purposed to fight spam, that's his role from the beginning.
It fluctuates over time. It was 0.0001 BTC/KB (same as mintxfee) two years ago before Mike Hearn advocated 10x decrease to 0.00001 BTC/KB. 
Well, guess what, at that point it doesn't prevent spam as there are actors willing to create gigabytes of transactions. So it needs to be increased. Each node operator sets it according to his own taste, if he's OK with a gigabyte of spam sitting in mempool then sure, he can keep it at 0.00001 BTC/KB, what's the problem? If he wants mempool to be more manageable then he should set this parameter higher.
For example, I set it to 0.00002 BTC/KB on nodes I manage, which is a bit lower than recommended.

True. People want cool things, they want fast transaction, they want to be able to pay everywhere with Bitcoin, etc.
But developers know how fragile it is. We are extremely lucky that we got a fully decentralized system working for 6 years without major flaws. Thousands of issues were fixed over this time, including dozens of really major issues. We were lucky that they were fixed before they did a lot of damage.
Developers knows that they need to be extremely cautious with everything, as we might not get another chance.
But people just do not understand software, especially _this_ kind of a software. They are used to apps. If there is a problem in an app, well, developer can make an update, it's not such a big deal.
But a decentralized system with thousands of nodes, thousands of agents with their own economic interest, and thousands of adversaries... is not an app. You can't just release an update if you screw it up.

It's certainly more work for wallet devs, but it's unavoidable, since the original Bitcoin tx format is kinda broken, we **have** to do the switch.
Complexity of SW shouldn't be compared to complexity of a 2 MB hard fork, it should be compared to complexity of segregating the witness.

When you design a crypto-based system, you need to choose number of bits which make it secure enough.
For ECDSA 256-bit key size is the bare minimum which make sense, as it gives you 128-bit equivalent security. It would be risky to go below 128-bit, especially as cryptoanalysis of ECDSA can make it weaker with time.
Cryptographic hash functions do not have this problem, hence 160-bit hash is more than enough to keep it safe, ECDSA is still the weakest link in the system.
160-bit addresses are smaller than 256-bit ones, hence it is possible to make it more convenient without compromising security.
Note that a notion of address is not a part of the Bitcoin protocol, so, in principle, people can switch to 256-bit addresses if there will be a problem with 160-bit ones... It is just that they aren't supported in the user interface.

Current market value takes flaws into account. Once flaws are fixed, ether might become **much** more valuable.
So shorting ETH is a bet that things will go worse before flaws are fixed.
Back in 2014 I was very skeptical of the idea of using low-level imperative VM, as contract interop will require a lot of infrastructure. So guess what: they developed this infrastructure, Solidity largely solves interop problems, there is a notion of ABI, etc.
So there is a non-zero chance that Ethereum's flaws will be fixed. It certainly takes more time than they originally anticipated (IIRC they planned to launch in 2015 with all cool apps already working), but there's a lot of devs still working on Ethereum.
If there is 1% chance that Ethereum will deliver on its promises and its market cap will reach $100B, it should be worth about $1B now. So I'd say it's foolish to short ETH.
Also it's worth noting that Tuur Demeester isn't a tech guy, so he cannot properly assess the severity of flaws and impossibility of fixing them.
Tech people know that it's very often the case that an imperfect solution wins. As Richard P.

Apparently at some pointed they realized that ASIC mining isn't going to be a lucrative business, but they already had money (and, perhaps, the team), so they decided to do something else. When you have a famous VC among founders it is easy to get people excited and get more money.
So if one has a certain plan, and then proceeds to do something completely different, did he have a solid plan in the first case? Apparently not. That's why I say they have no idea what they're doing.

Well, let's do the math. 
On AMD Phenom II X4 955 people achieved 11 MH/s of Bitcoin mining and 22 kH/s of Litecoin mining. Thus Litecoin is 500 times slower on this hardware. (Of course, it heavily depends on optimization, it's just a ballpark number.)
Another data point: Intel Core 2 Duo E7300: 2.5 MH/s vs 7 kH/s. Litecoin is 357 times slower.
On GPU, let's take AMD 5870 for example, higher reported for Bitcoin is 480 MH/s vs Litecoin 442 kH/s, 1085 times slower.
I don't think direct comparison of ASICs is possible, but one thing to note is difference is bigger on GPU than on CPU because CPU comes with "free" L1/L2 cache which is relevant for Litecoin mining, while GPU memory isn't so fast.
So for ASIC which has no "free" memory, the scrypt slowdown will be much greater, by some estimates by a factor of 10.
So we might expect Litecoin to be 10000 slower on similar sized ASIC, thus making it only 38 times weaker than Bitcoin.
If you want a safe number, you can use 1000x as it was observed on GPUs.

Ripple has a blockchain, but could in principle work without it. That is, a Ripple node only needs to know current account balances but doesn't care about the past.
If you mean without public balances being visible, that's a bit more complicated... I think the original decentralized Ripple proposal (which has absolutely nothing to do with Ripple.com) was like that, the idea was that balances are local to nodes. But it has no global cryptocurrency. It is like a system for recording obligations.

Lightning Network is going to be horrible, as far as I can tell. It works great in theory, but in practice UX might be horrible: fee will depend on who you send money to (and how much), money might be stuck in channels, etc.

The Fed's book affects only how many dollars the Fed can remove from economy if it wants to. But it is not what backs dollars. Basically, dollar is backed by nothing.

Well, MD5 collisions should be extremely rare as well, but people can easily produce them on purpose now, as it has certain weaknesses.
SHA256 is actually quite similar to MD5 in design, but currently people haven't found any weaknesses in it. So SHA256 can be used as "a proof beyond reasonable doubt", of course, but my point is that it's impossible to tell whether a hash function is secure just by looking at it.
It took cryptoanalytics a decade to find a way to break MD5 (although they suspected that there is a weakness just few years after it was published).

I think the most simple and most robust way to do this is this process:

1.  Person willing to participate in cash-for-karma service (let's call it this way) needs to register on service's web site. 
2. He receives a bitcoin address he needs to send bitcoins to. Once he sends something to this address it shows up in his account as available for donations
3. He sets up how he is willing to donate -- e.g. 0.01 BTC per upvote or 0.1% of remaining account balance at cash-for-karma service or whatever.
4. Each time he sends an upvote either through service's API or through some feed (RSS, public reddit upvotes, whatever) this URL receives donation.
5. Once URL gets 0.01 BTC its owner can withdraw it.
6. When URL gets a significant amount of money, say 10 BTC URL owner get email which says that he have got a certain sum of money through this program and he can withdraw it in a certain way.

Problems I see with it:

1. One of biggest problem is that it is not P2P but service's owner basically operates an escrow service. So it there is a question of trust. But I see a lot of BitCoin services which work in this way -- MtGox, witcoin, MyBitCoin, YouTipIt -- so maybe it is not a huge problem. Besides that I've seen people are willing to give their BitCoins to strangers, so maybe it is not an issue.
I would love to make it fully P2P, but then it needs to work with BitCoin client to make it automatic. If thing gets popular -- why not? Just requires a lot more programming (+ some crypto, I guess).

2. Service might accumulate a lot of "float" from non-withdrawable donations.  I think it is possible to solve this issue by allowing donations to expire -- say, if sum was not withdrawed in a year or so donation amount is returned to donor, then it can re-use it. Or maybe it can be given to sites which get more upvotes so they have higher chances of accumulating a significant sum.

3. There is a problem with identifying site owner, but I think there are some ways to solve it. At beginning it can work manually.

4. I guess some sight owners will be reluctant to withdraw because they would think it is some kind of scam. But I hope that nicely written email which explains everything will convince them.




There is an easy way to withdraw through MyBitCoin web service and BitCoin-to-PayPal services like CoinCard.

So if they get a significant amount they'd get nice email which describes how to withdraw.




That's why I think only upvotes of people who actually donate BitCoins should matter.

Actually my initial idea was to use upvotes for non-donors too, but I thought about problems with abuse. As BitCoin is simple to use and can operate with small amounts it is easy to join and actually pay something.

So I think it should be "put your money where your mouth is" kind of program.

(witcoin goes even further --you need to pay 0.01 BTC just to post a comment or upvote something, for example.)

No, I don't. Salt is supposed to be available to attackers. That's why it is called "salt" and not "key".


No, it isn't. Hash-function mixes salt with password in such way that it is not unmixable (that's a property of crypto-hashes), and so for the sake of rainbow-tables precomputation it is as good as having a longer password.
Long and properly applies salt makes precomputed lookup table attacks infeasible. Check wikipedia.

Reserves isn't same as depositors funds!
If reserve requirement is 10% then out of $1000 deposited into a bank bank can lend $900, and is required to keep $100 as reserves, in case people would want their money back.
As I said three times already, there are two things \* affecting how much banks can lend: accounting/arithmetic rules which won't allow them to lend more than deposited (balance cannot be negative), and reserve rules which require them to keep some amount, thus reducing how much they can lend even more.
You see, very few people take a loan for it just to sit in their account, they will either take cash or pay to someone who is a customer of another bank. Cash is government money, inter-bank transfer use government money, so banks absolutely need government money to lend money. (Aside from things like credit cards.)
(\*: Reserves barely matter now as they are around 1% now, but there is a bunch of other requirements which banks need to satisfy.)

Fedcoin will be a major benefit over the existing banking system: it would allow a transition from fractional reserve to full reserve and thus eliminate systemic risk.
Fedcoin is not the same as Bitcoin, obviously. Unlike Bitcoin, Fedcoin won't have a fixed money supply and, likely, won't be a censorship-resistant.
But is has benefits over Bitcoin: relatively stable value (exchange rate) and an ability to implement a monetary policy to affect the state of the economy.
So which is better depends on your preferences. Of course, libertarians and Austrian economics proponents will say that Bitcoin is better.
But guess what, the majority of people aren't libertarians, and the majority of economists do not take Austrian economic theory seriously. Thus, **for them**, Fedcoin is better. You might disagree with it, but that's just the reality of it.
You're probably think you're pro-freedom, but how can you say that if you deny people a basic freedom of thinking differently from you by disrespecting their opinion?
Now as for "Bankcoins", yes, it won't have any benefits over the current banking system, it will be essentially just an upgrade to banking hardware/software.
And BTW about "permissioned ledgers", it is Tim Swanson's idea that everything except Bitcoin is permissioned. It is utterly fucking wrong. These are orthogonal concepts. A private/federated blockchain can be permissionless, and you can make a permissioned ledger within Bitcoin. 
Fedcoin can, potentially, be permissionless. It probably won't be. But it has nothing to do with the technology.

But Factom does much more than ChainPoint, it organizes entries into chains, so you can get a collection of all entries at a certain point, or prove that a certain entry doesn't exist.
ChainPoint is just timestamping. It lets you to prove that a certain thing existed at a certain point of time, but it won't help you to establish integrity of your records.
Here's a formal description of an integrity problem from Peter Todd:


that some set of records R_i_ that she has given to Bob is the same set
of records she has given to everyone else - that is no R_i'_ exists.
Secondly Alice can update the records producing R_{i+1}_, and Bob can
determine if such an update exists.

It is certainly easier to get in since libraries are available for many programming languages (C++, Java, C JS, Python, C so chances that you can find one _for the language you already know_ are higher.
But it never was _he crypto voodoo_. The original Bitcoin source code is in C++, and it is very much object oriented. It's not very nice, though, but that's mostly because of C++.

$1 increase is absolutely arbitrary metric, as it's not scale invariant. E.g. if Satoshi decided to make 21 billion bitcoins instead of 21 millions, "$1 increase" would have 1000 bigger effect. (I.e. if we consider $1 increase of mBTC rather than of BTC.)
1% increase would be better, as it's scale-invariant.
1% increase of Bitcoin price makes me richer than 1% increase of Ethereum price.

There is another option: non-trusted exchanger will just pay trusted one in advance, and then use this deposit to move user's money.
Perhaps trusted exchanger will give him a bit of a credit: e.g. if you deposit $1000 you get $100 extra as a possible loan, since it is unlikely that person will deposit his $1000 just to steal $100.
Then as business grows so will trust and lines of credit.
I don't know how much trust is needed to make it working. Perhaps larger exchanger will need only a small fraction of their daily turnover as outflow will be balanced with inflow.
And smaller exchangers will have to pay rather than rely on trust, but they'll have many options.
And if there is still risk it is possible to factor it in with insurance. With high bitcoin exchange rate volatility allocating 0.5-1% for insurance is not a problem at all, and with a large turnover insurance pool can cover a lot of risks. But one needs to trust the insurers...

First of all, you're saying this from a position of a person who earns more than he spends and has many safe investment options. But it just not the case for the overwhelming majority of people living on Earth it is just not the case.
Second, when we're talking about an individual (or a family), his life is always a part of a portfolio... If John Smith earns $50k a year, from the portfolio theory point of view you can count it as a bond which pays $50k a year. Of course, there is always a risk that John will be fired and won't be able to find another job, or that he'll get sick.
So anyway, you might calculate that the net present value of "John Smith" is $500k, and if he happens to have $20k worth of bitcoins and no other assets, bitcoins constitute only ~4% of his portfolio.
To check whether this makes sense, consider two scenario:
 * Bitcoin price goes to zero. John Smith says "fuck it" and keeps working. In 10 years that loss won't really matter.
 * Bitcoin price says the same, but John Smith loses both limbs and can no longer work, thus has no earnings.
Obviously the second scenario is much worse and much more devastating, which reflects the fact that they constitute only 4% of John's portfolio.
Of course you might say that one's earnings and savings should be counted separately, but it's just a matter of how you look at it.
Keep in mind that a lot of people _have_ to live paycheck-to-paycheck and have basically no savings. It is risky, but they can't help it.

Which is more than enough for 1000 tps. I don't buy the argument that we absolutely need to scale it to 1,000,000 tps, but also in such a way that Joe the Average's computer will cope.
Getting to 1000 tps will be a good start, and at that point bandwidth is not a problem (well, aside from the initial download). Once we get there a situation with bandwidth, processing power, storage and state-of-the-art algorithms will be very different, so I don't think that basing estimations on the current speeds makes sense.

Forcing all full nodes to upgrade within 1 month time frame will be considered too reckless by many, and thus inevitably you'll have opposition and chain split.
On the other hand, if miners coordinate SW activation now, we can do it in one month in a safe way.
That said, I'm not sure fast UASF is better than fast HF. The only advantage of UASF is that upgrading isn't mandatory.

It just means that real interest rate is much higher for borrowers. 
I.e. you get 1% loan it bitcoins, this means for 100 BTC loan you have to return 101 BTC. Then you, for example, convert BTC to USD at 100 USD for 1 BTC rate (so you have 10000 USD), do something with those USD.
Now it is time to pay back, and you see that exchange rate went up to 101 USD for 1 BTC. Now you need 101*101 = 10201 USD to pay for loan.
So real interest rate in USD is 10201/10000 ~= 2%, while nominal interest rate is 1%.
Or, in other words, there is 1% interest rate and 1% deflation which add up to 1+1 = 2%. Makes sense, no?
Now what's about banks, they don't give a fuck. If you agree to pay 1% interest rate this means that you need to return 101 BTC for 100 BTC loaned, no matter where exchange rate went.
Bank then pays part of this interest to depositors. E.g. it returns 100.5 BTC to guy who deposited 100 BTC and leaves 0.5 BTC for itself.

Do you even understand how Bitcoin works? 
Bitcoin establishes consensus about what gets into blocks.
What is in mempool is a local policy. Different nodes can (and do!) adopt various policies about what to accept to mempool, how to select transactions into blocks etc. Pretty much all miners run customized node software.
So mempool policy is just not a big deal. 


Why do you freak out? Transactions are permanent only once they are in the block, that's the whole point of the blockchain.
`[censored]` adopted a different policy here, it kicks out some random transactions once mempool is full, which is probably more prone to exploitation.
@_date: 2015-11-10 10:58:22
Well, from technical perspective there might be a way to have a cake and eat it too. I doubt what we have now is really the optimal form of blockchain and possible improvements can obviate the trade-off.

It's important to be aware of latest block headers. You should try to get the longest chain (the one with most PoW) by querying different nodes on the network.
Once you get block headers, it doesn't matter where you download block contents from. Block header has a hash of block content, so if block content is invalid you just discard it and try other source.
So it doesn't matter. You can download block data from your worst enemy, if it hashes to the thing as you see in block headers, it's the same data.

At which point it would make more sense to use specialized protocols than this Bloom filter thing Mike have designed.
For example, Electrum connects servers which index the blockchain, obviously it makes more sense to use indexed data than to rescan a fragment of a blockchain.

That makes sense only if you assume that Bitcoin PoW is perfect. Innovation on consensus level will typically require issuance of new coins for security incentives.

That's not how Bitcoin development works. _Anybody_ can develop code, but there is one guy who is like a chief editor, he decides when to merge changes to avoid the mess.
So Gavin used to be that guy, but in 2014 he have [voluntarily stepped down]( But he still had a "chief editor" access, so he potentially could server as a backup (but he never did).
But having a "backup" person with "editor" access is bad from security standpoint. And there is no need for a backup, since people can trivially migrate to a different repository if needed. (That's how git development model works.)
Thus having Gavin as a "backup chief editor" makes no sense, but people kept him because there is no good reason to remove, and it could be a bad PR. Craig Wright bs became a formal reason, like the last straw.
I think most people will agree that Gavin acts erratically (or kinda happy-go-lucky, if you will), and it's generally a bad idea for such a person to be in charge of security-sensitive projects.
One simple example: Peter Todd PGP-signs all his mails, even unimportant ones. So it's very hard to pretend to be Peter Todd. On the other hand, Gavin Andresen didn't even bother to sign an important announcement about Craig Wright, so people were left wondering if the announcement is real. I think he should be kicked out for this shit alone.

Eventually =/= each month. Did you mean "per month"?
There is a big difference. If growth is expected some time in future, price will go up now, but growth will happen ...in future.
You can see it all the time on stock market. P/E (price/earnings) shows how much company earns now (i.e. in the past year), but investors look for _future_ P/E, year from now or even more. So if company doesn't earn that much each month _now_ it isn't a big deal.


Formula is the same, but conclusion is different. Title you've chosen was "Are we printing too many bitcoins?". As I've said, you should be asking "Isn't bitcoin price too high?". Then you can look for reasons WHY investors might expecting that growth.

Value of an amount of currency is measured in what you can buy for it. If exchange rate to USD is constant then amount of things you can buy for 1 BTC stays fixed, or, rather, decays slowly together with USD inflation.
It doesn't fucking matter how many BTC exist.
But if exchange rate is constant but new BTC are mined you can expect that money enters into BTC economy exactly at the same pace as new coins are mined.
E.g. 7200 BTC is mined each day. At exchange rate 1 BTC = 4 USD we need $28.8k extra USD to enter the system each day, i.e. (BTC bought - BTC sold) = $28.8k USD.

That's not how it works. 
First of all, neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum has a _ledger_. Both have  a _block chain_, which is a sequence of transactions timestamped using blocks.
Once in a block chain, a transaction _cannot_ be changed, it can only be removed through a block chain reorganization (i.e. blocks are replaced by different blocks which do not have that transaction).
Besides a block chain, cryptocurrencies have a notion of _state_, which is essentially an interpretation of data contained in the block chain: transaction data is processed using a certain algorithm and results of this processing is usually stored in a database of some sort. In case of Bitcoin, it is (mostly) a set of all unspent transaction outputs (UTXO set). In case of Ethereum, it is a database of contract states and account states.
Hard forks might change how data is processed, i.e. they change the interpretation of the blockchain data. "The DAO" hard fork added some unauthorized transfers.
I think here:


you're talking about proof-of-existence and proof-of-publication. They won't be affected by the kind of hard forks Ethereum did, as those hard forks do not remove data from a block chain.
The hard fork, however, casts a doubt on Ethereum's usefulness. The big part of Ethereum's appeal is that one can implement application logic in EVM smart contracts, but if EVM state is unreliable, neither is an application. And if you use only low-level primitives such as proof-of-existence, you might as well just use Bitcoin.

What's about things like prediction markets, DAOs (i.e. shareholder-controlled funds), derivatives (e.g. stable-coins)? 
Ethereum is not unique, of course, but it might be the first blockchain to offer these features in a coherent manner. All of them involve locking coins in a contract, so it might result in massively increased demand for ETH (as it's the only counterparty risk free coin in Ethereum system).
Would you say that a probability of this happening is exactly zero, or is it just kinda unlikely?


US dollar and banks and lawyers are in a different category. Ethereum is the worse solution in the category of blockchains-with-smart-contracts.


Yes, there is a lot of bullshit, but that doesn't mean there are no legit use cases. I outlined them in [this comment]( It also includes comparison with a possible Bitcoin-based solutions.
I've heard there is also a lot of interest from cryptocurrency researchers. They know it's less than perfect, but Ethereum is also the simplest way to implement a custom blockchain: if you don't care about consensus parts, **any** kind of a custom blockchain can be implemented as an Ethereum contract. And it takes 10-100 times less time than coding a custom blockchain in C++, for example. So there is it.

I believe that these companies plan to exit through acquisition.

That's their actual plan. They might also have a formal plan like "if we have 1 billion users and get 1 cent from each, we'll get 10 million dollars", but that's just bullshit.

The valid chain with most work wins. Blocks which are considered invalid do not count.


So an operator is supposed to know about some kind of consensus which isn't the part of a protocol specification? Is he supposed to learn about block limit settings from reddit or something?


The point of Bitcoin is to provide automatic consensus within certain rules. The rules themselves aren't a subject to this automatic consensus. Say, if miners start giving themselves 100 BTC per block nodes will reject those blocks even if 99.999% miners vote for them.

Suppose Alice is the current owner of a house. She prepares a document which transfers ownership of this house to Bob and timestamps it in the blockchain. Bob pays her money, as there is a proof that Alice transferred ownership to him.
She also prepares a document which transfers ownership of this house to Carol, timestamps it, and Carol pays her money as well.
That is, Alice have double-spent a house. These are two different documents with two different hashes, but they try to spend the same object, and a timestamping system can't help here. It might establish that Bob's document was timestamped first, but it won't help Carol. Carol might demand Alice to return her money, but we cannot prevent the problem.
On the other hand, with a proper proof-of-publication system you can query all documents in a certain category. E.g. all documents signed by Alice, or all documents involving a particular house, etc. Proof-of-publication can help in this case, as Carol can notice that the house was already transferred to Bob and thus she won't be fooled.
Peter Todd's [Uniquebits]( allow one to scan the blockchain by publisher's fingerprint and topic. This is what allows one to prove that "no conflicting versions of those records existed".


It can store data too. But in many cases it's enough to have a complete collection of hashes. E.g. if Bob knows he has a complete collection of hashes he can then ask Alice to provide data for each of these hashes.

I don't insist on using a dictionary definition; but it's important to clarify definitions before discussion, and your definition is unacceptable, in my opinion: You do not define a property, you describe an ideal system which you believe has this property. Everything is wrong about that.
This is what religious people do. They might define that good people must believe in God. In that case if you don't believe in God, you aren't a good person, by definition. It's impossible to argue with that.
On the other hand, if a mathematician will claim that "Property Y is something object X possesses, and thus object X possesses property Y", others will laugh at him, or get annoyed for wasting their time.
Do you realize that your reasoning is much closer to reasoning of a religious person than to reasoning of a mathematician?
If you want to be treated seriously, you must define "decentralized" in such a way that it has no explicit references to the object of your consideration (Bitcoin), and then prove that Bitcoin has this property and other systems don't.
For example, A. Poelstra [have demonstrated]( that PoW can be used to obtain _distributed consensus_ and PoS cannot. I disagree with conclusions, but at least his methodology isn't horribly broken. 


No. First of all, we were initially talking about smart contracts, I asked if it's possible to replicate BitShares pegging mechanism in Bitcoin. BitShares decentralization (or lack of thereof) is completely irrelevant.
I am not advertising BitShares, I do not make any claims about properties of BitShares consensus algorithm, I haven't studied it in detail.
My claims about PoS are based on my own research, which was described in an [academic paper]( It has no relationship to BitShares or any other existing PoS implementation. BTW in this paper we demonstrated that PPCoin is broken.


Frankly, I just don't care anymore... I co-authored [a paper]( which demonstrates that PoW+PoS combination is better than PoW alone. This paper includes a list of possible flaws of pure PoW. I see no way to fix PoW, if you see it, go ahead. 


I'm only quoting Vitalik because his article is well known, otherwise we got to same conclusions independently. If you think our reasoning is flawed then go ahead and explain why.


Same mechanisms can be used to bootstrap PoS nodes securely.


I couldn't find the original source of "there's nothing at stake" problem, only Gavin A. quoting A. Miller. I have no idea what Miller meant by it, but it seems like Gavin interpreted it similarly to what gmaxwell calls "hobson's-choice-attack" in [this comment]( "you confirm the weaker one because **doing so cost you nothing**, and in the event that it does win". Sounds a lot like "nothing at stake", no?
Costless simulation is a separate issue, it was originally described by Poelstra and Maxwell, I believe. In any case it's much less ambiguous than "nothing at stake".


The thing is, you **cannot** rewrite history on others' computers. It makes no sense to talk about cost of something if it's physically impossible. Thus PoS is actually stronger than PoW in some sense, as we can say that a cost of rewrite is  ∞ because it's impossible. :D


If you do, then you also must understand that PoW _also_ requires weak subjectivity.
Suppose you've got correct Bitcoin software, such as Bitcoin Core.
Suppose after synchronizing with the network you receive a payment, a large sum like 10000 BTC, for example. After waiting 6 (or, maybe, 12 confirmations) you ship the goods.
Can you be sure that you weren't defrauded, assuming that Bitcoin Core software is correct and your computer is not compromised?
The answer is no. If attacker is able to control your network, he can force your node to synchronize with his own blockchain. The cost of an attack is non-zero, but it can be arbitrary low.
Thus, by itself, **PoW guarantees no payment security**. PoW sort of secures the network as a whole, but what users care about is security of payments, and PoW doesn't help much.
You can easily protect yourself by comparing last block hash with that present in some external system, such as blockchain.info, or a node of your friend, or something. Which is same as "weak subjectivity". This means that weak subjectivity is necessary both for PoW and PoS.

It's an experiment using **Ethereum** blockchain.
There is nothing particularly exciting about it. Any game with a perfect information can be implemented on a blockchain using Solidity smart contract language, and it's not hard. It's not more complex than implementing game rules in C++ or Java. Like a couple of days of work, seriously.
The problem with this approach is that every move needs to be recorded in the blockchain, so it's impractical.

For some value if "works". Bitcoin is currently dominated by a handful of large miners.
There might be better ways to do PoW. E.g. memory-hard PoW functions to level the field, better incentive structure, or a combination of PoW + PoS.
A side chain without a coin issuance won't have security until it has a large trade volume, so there is chicken &amp; egg problem.
Sorry, I don't think that it's best to leave security to Jihan Wu's judgement, that's just laughable. Jihan your coins if you want to Jihan.

Sorry, but you haven't been thinking hard enough, Roger. It is enough to do a little thought experiment.
Suppose some entity (let's say R3, using $200M they are trying to raise) will launch 10000 new Bitcoin nodes overnight. Will the network become stronger? 
What if they manage to run a million new nodes? Would that make Bitcoin super-strong?
It's obvious that "the total number of full nodes" doesn't mean a shit.


So for Roger Ver Bitcoin is kinda similar to BitTorrent: something decentralized, p2p.
But security and distributed systems experts understand that there is an abyss of difference between BitTorrent and Bitcoin, and what makes BitTorrent robust won't really help Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is much more complex and subtle. Besides nodes we also have miners. And the currency, you know.


But that government-controlled-coin exists only in your imagination, Roger! ("For all we know" isn't really an argument. Seriously.) So what you're saying is that you're OK with the risk of Bitcoin becoming "centralized and controlled" just because that government-controlled-coin spooks you.
This is kinda ironic: we are so scared of a government-controlled-coin that we are going create it itself.
Roger probably thinks that this risk is minimal, but people who actually are experts say that it's real.

I think the problem is that Bitcoin is mis-advertised. In the original paper Satoshi mentioned that a transaction confirmation usually takes an hour. But it's not the worst case.
So somebody sending money using Bitcoin should be prepared that it might take several hours. This has nothing to do with fees or block sizes, it's just how Bitcoin works: it doesn't confirm transactions in the real time.
People who want instant confirmations will be better off using other blockchains. But, sadly, it's very hard for Bitcoin supporters to admit that Bitcoin isn't perfect and other blockchains do exist.

1. The actual default value of mintxfee used now is 1 sat/B:  (You can see further down the code that it's a default value for -mintxfee parameter.)
2. This parameter is actually all but irrelevant. It has no effect on node/mining, only on Bitcoin Core wallet. Even then, it rarely comes to play as Bitcoin Core wallet uses dynamic fee estimation.
3. The one which actually matters is minrelaytxfee, as it affects how transactions are propagated and whether miners will even consider it (assuming they use default parameters).
So minrelaytxfee is a de facto minimum tx fee, and mintxfee is a completely irrelevant parameter.

"Coin-storage key voting" is more narrow than "coin voting".
The thing is, it is impossible to eliminate a possibility of vote selling. You can make it slightly inconvenient by requiring "coin-storage keys" to be used. But if vote selling is a thing, somebody might develop a wallet which will automatically sell votes for a bribe. 
On the other hand, by allowing secondary keys you can enable much wider participation, as those people who keep their coins in cold storage will be able to participate.
So the question is: Does wider participation outweigh the effect of easy vote selling?
As to the definition of 'coin voting', I think the idea is that votes should correspond to the intent of coin holder(s). if coin holders' intent is to delegate votes to somebody else, then so be it.

Well, people attempted to write a protocol specification here; 


Ever heard of BIPs?
Commits which are not associated with BIPs are supposed to preserve consensus-critical behavior. Every patch is code reviewed. That is, on the left side people have old code, on the right side they have new code, and they need to analyze whether it does the same thing.


Yeah, surely none of Bitcoin Core developers were ever employed as professional software engineers. All those guys are amateurs. If we had _true_ software engineers, Bitcoin would have been 10x more awesome.
What you're missing is that big companies employ  200 people to do the work which can be done by 10. They do that by adding a lot of extra steps like all sort of meetings, design documents and all sorts of bureaucratic procedures. They have to do it because they don't know who of their 200 devs really can code, so they need to slow down everyone.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin Core devs never broke consensus in 5 years. There was one forking event, but it was a problem with an external library older code base was using, it's not something which protocol specification could help with.
On the other hand, products developed by big companies suck big time. For example, Skype. Microsoft has many hundreds (thousands?) people working on Skype. But it sucks big time: they break compatibility all the time, and can't maintain a consistent feature set across all clients (e.g. Android and iOS clients do not support video when more than 2 people are involved). And it is also very unreliable and full of strange issues.
If you have few billion dollars to spare let's invite these "professional software engineers" to work on Bitcoin and see how they fuck shit up.
Surely know everything much better than the team which has a track record of keeping Bitcoin relatively bug free for 5+ years.

In the analysis above I considered only direct effect on price within a specific time frame. Of course, if we consider overall effect on the price in general then it's positive.
Consider another extreme example: suppose that 99% of all bitcoins are owned by hodlers who aren't going to sell it. However, bitcoins are still being mined. And if demand is very weak for some reason, then the price might fall. Thus hodlers aren't really helping.
You might say that the assumption that the demand is weak is not realistic: if holders really hold bitcoins so tightly there must be an explanation for that, and thus the demand should be higher.
However, it is just a model of a different kind. I.e. in one model you consider direct effect of different actions, and in another you consider rational actors, equilibrium, arbitrage and so on. Also it matters if you consider actions on a specific time interval or the whole history, etc.

We need a bigger market cap for bigger trades. The market cap will be bigger when more people will invest into bitcoins. It doesn't look like the existing Bitcoin user base is going to invest more: The market cap didn't grow in ~3 years, it's clear that everyone who already invested already did.
So for it to grow further we need more people to invest. More people will invest if it becomes simpler/safer/more convenient, e.g. they can make it a part of their 401k portfolio.
I really doubt people will do that to speculate, more likely they will consider Bitcoin being a [safe asset]( in the sense that it's uncorrelated with US bonds/stocks, and thus is interesting as an alternative asset.

Why do you think it's more useful as a medium of exchange than a store of value?
If you're an average US consumer, I guess you have few reasons to care about Bitcoin at all. It's more like a novelty.
However, in other countries keeping one's savings isn't so trivial, as banking system isn't so trustworthy. Say, I live in Ukraine. Keeping money in a bank is risky. Many banks got bankrupt, and you never know if/when government will compensate you. (Also max compensation is $7000 now.) Dollars-under-the-mattress is certainly a method of choice for a lot of people, but the problem is that it can be stolen. Same thing with gold.
Bitcoin is certainly an attractive option for tech-savvy people who know how to store it securely. I'm not talking about keeping all your savings in Bitcoin. But it can be a method of diversification, e.g. if your bank account is defunct and gold/dollars-under-mattress are stolen, you will still have your bitcoins. So it would make sense to store, say, 20% of one's savings.
Of course, we need safe exchanges and wallets for it to be practical. But suppose this problem is solved and an average person can easily use put his savings into Bitcoin. If people convert 10-20% of their savings to Bitcoin, an effect on the market cap will be huge.
So the main factor is usefulness as a store of value, not as a medium of exchange. A medium of exchange is kinda nice too, but it is completely dwarfed by a store of value.
So what's your point?
 Would you say: "Fuck you people in Ukraine, you should keep stuffing your mattresses with dollars, as Bitcoin was _meant_ to be used as a medium of exchange! And fuck you goldbugs too, just keep hoarding gold, DO NOT HODL bitcoins!!!" LOL.
Do the math. Medium of exchange is largely irrelevant.


And why would they actually buy stuff with Bitcoin? That just makes no sense unless person _already has bitcoins_ (i.e. has _Bitcoin savings_) or has a Bitcoin income.
Bitcoin might be a viable alternative to international bank wires (those things seriously suck), but other than that it's niche.


You say speculation, I say people will actually buy bitcoins because they want to. Perhaps they do not trust the government, or do not like dollars, or do not have other great options.

Yes, as short-term loans. All of them were paid back within 1-2 years.

Yes, that stuff is much more interesting than CW itself.
It's sort of like proof by contradiction: a small contraction can prove a large and complex theorem.
CW is a serial scammer, it's obvious from his bio. But noises some people in the community made about him are hard to explain without a conspiracy of some sort.
There were at least three 'crypto' guys who confirmed CW: Ian Grigg, Gavin Andresen and Joseph VaughnPerling.
They should have good understanding of security, and they have reputation at stake, (who wants to hire a compromised security guy?), so it's very strange for them to fall for CW bullshit.
Add to this that GA and JVP interacted with the real Satoshi at very early stages.
So what are the possibilities?
1. All three were duped.
2. There is a conspiracy of some sort.
3. Some of them are trolling.
In case with JVP, being duped isn't really possible, as [he claims he met CW/SN back in 2005](
So assuming CW is distinguishable from SN, JVP must be trolling us. Also it appears that there is an association between JVP and IG (as implied in the article).
Also note that IG claims that CW was member of "Team Satoshi" from "direct knowledge", also he claims that Dave Kleiman was also a member of that group. I don't see how CW could dupe him to the state where he would claim such things.
Also note that the Tulip Trust story told by CW and JVP reeks of bullshit. Suppose CW and DK were indeed members of TeamSatoshi and needed to put money into a trust. Any crypto reasonable crypto person would put money into N-of-M multisig. People who designed Bitcoin multi-sig capabilities obviously knew how to do that. Yet they relied on some people to hold private keys -- knowing that coins weren't really moved into a trust and previous owner could have easily preserved private keys. Obviously, this is a story to defraud authorities, any tech person would understand that they need to move coins if there is an actual trust.

Thus the question isn't whether UASF can happen (since they already happened, that's already decided), the question is what are sufficient conditions for a safe/successful UASF.
And that's inherently subjective since it depends on your definition of safe/successful, as well as a threat model.
It doesn't make sense for me to formulate the model and criteria, since you can easily question my assumptions. This isn't productive.
But here's a pragmatic condition: if major exchanges and payment processors -- Coinbase, Bitstamp, BitPay -- commit to a soft fork, then it's extremely likely to be successful.
It's very simple: suppose you are buying bitcoins, do you want coins which accepted by merchants through Coinbase and is trade on Bitstamp? Almost all traders will prefer these mainstream coins which are accepted by mainstream companies.
Thus, unless there's a situation where these companies will lost almost all users, they are deciding on what Bitcoin is.
Miners want to mine coins which have value, and since traders give bitcoins value, they will mine coins chosen by traders (which are in practice chosen by companies traders use).
The best example of this is 2013 chain split where people didn't have time for bullshit and had to act fast [chat log](
    23:07	Luke-Jr	MagicalTux: is MtGox on the 0.8 or pre-0.8 side of the fork?
    23:08	MagicalTux	pre-0.8
    ...
    23:31	Eleuthria	Working on rolling back BTC Guild to 0.7 now.
Basically, miners rolled back the larger chain to get on the chain which MtGox used.
And this is why we have a deadlock on the scaling decision: big Bitcoin companies are avoiding this decision.

Well, this is how cryptocurrencies work in general.
Although Bitcoin can be upgraded via soft-fork, you still rely on consensus-critical parts of the code to be identical among all the miners.
On the other hand, if you have a cryptocurrency based on client-side validation, you need code to be identical for all the wallets. But this is hardly a bigger requirement IMHO
Generally speaking, a color kernel can be updated in a safe way: you just need to be sure that the old kernel won't misinterpret the data.
One way to do this is to add a protocol version as a transaction meta-data, in some way. So a client which only understands protocol v.1 sees a v.2 transaction, it should be assume that all outputs have undefined or null colorvalue. While a newer client will be able to understand both v.1 and v.2 transactions. So if somebody runs an old client, he will just receive a warning message.
But this isn't specific to "functional colored coins".
I think it might be a good idea to define a VM in a formal way, and implement a color kernel in terms of it. Then there will be no ambiguity in color kernel specification, and you also get an ability to import different kernels with different logic.

No, the central bank keeps the main ledger.


Each bank keeps track of its own loans and deposits. It also has an account within the central bank.
When one bank pays to another, it (usually) goes through the central bank system. So if banks gives too many loans, it can be easily detected: it will have too little money on the central bank account and won't be able to carry out operations.


It can be backed either by paper money or by electronic money on CB's account. Actually right now M1 ("virtual" money issued by banks) isn't very far from MB (money issued by the central bank) in US and EU due to policies.

Mike Hearn's vision is that we'll have millions of SPV wallets connecting to thousands of full nodes to fetch information about transactions relevant to them. Thus about 1000 clients per node.
If one of those SPV clients need to restore an old wallet, it will request your node to scan the whole blockchain for transactions relevant to that wallet. If you wonder about resource usage you can try launching your node with `-rescan` option.

The main problem is that "classical distributed databases" do not exist.

Would you say that people who use Bitcoin as a store of value, i.e. put a part of their savings into it, are speculating? It is speculation in the sense that any Bitcoin holder hopes that its price will go up. But use as a store of value is basically Bitcoin's raison d'être.


Wrong. Day traders, market makers and speculators increase liquidity, which is absolutely crucial for low volatility.
Illiquid markets have a huge spread. E.g. [ETH/BTC on OpenLedger decentralized exchage]( has ask 38% higher than bid. On Poloniex exchange which has much larger trading volume the difference between bid and ask is less than 1%.
Trade volume is also correlated with market depth, and thus slippage on large orders.
E.g. suppose some companies want to use Bitcoin for international trade. Importer will buy bitcoins in his country and send them to exporter in a different country, which sell them on a local exchange to get dollars.
If exchanges are rather illiquid there will be a lot of slippage. E.g. suppose importer tries to buy $10M worth of bitcoins, but as he buys on the market price goes up. Then exporter sells bitcoins and price goes down. So it is very well possible that the exporter gets only $5M dollars back.
When importer buys bitcoins on an exchange, he buys them mostly from day traders, arbitrageurs and market makers. In other words, speculators.
If there is a lot of these speculators, they all compete with each other, and slippage will be minimal. If you have few of them, then you have a lot of slippage.
So, basically, it is exactly the opposite of what you said: speculation decreases volatility.
Markets without speculators don't even have a price, it's undefined.

The difference between "any protocol" and Bitcoin protocol is that Bitcoin works only if consensus-critical parts are 100% identical. Thus you need a very, very precise specification. Formalized even. 
And do you know how do we call those? Code.

[This]( wiki article discusses it in details. Basic conclusion is that if it is going to be used at same rates as VISA and PayPal you'll need plenty fast computers at each node.
Professional miners will be able to afford this, but not an average person. They might opt to use simple verification process instead of full verification, so it is still possible to use the network without running a full node.

It isn't in any way related to reserves and reserve ratios. Laws of accounting are more fundamental than that, they affect _all_ companies, not just banks.
If banks won't be get money from checking account owners, they will get it from people who explicitly want to invest. In fact, it already happens now with all these mortgage-backed securities, bonds, etc. Banks barely care about transactional accounts.
So the thing is, money needs to come from somebody, and that somebody will definitely want to know whether bank will be able to pay back. It's not really "self-imposed rules", these are basic laws of arithmetic and common sense.
If bank just creates money without borrowing it from somewhere, it will be funny money not exchangeable for government money. Nobody will want that shit.

As I mentioned I'm fully aware of this issue. I know Peter Todd and I know his arguments, usually we agree on most points.
My point was that storage is the bottleneck. You know what "bottleneck" means, right?
Sure, at some point CPU and network bandwidth become problem too, but storage becomes a problem sooner, and it much harder to solve it.
As I mentioned, you can achieve a fairly high transaction rate using today hardware, but a storage problem can become practically intractable neither today, not in near future.

A blockchain isn't a separate thing, it is essentially just meta-data which describes who confirmed adding specific transactions. When a database keeps the original pieces of data sent by users (transactions) together with this meta-data about blocks, one should be able to check when a specific piece of data was added, whether it was tampered with, etc. And you can use that for replication too: a replica will receive all the original transactions and block headers, and so it will be able to verify that it received an accurate copy and nothing was omitted.
So it is something you can use instead of binlogs. Yeah you are supposed to store it in perpetuity if you want to be able to verify everything. But, in principle, a new node might receive a snapshot of the state together with signatures of all other nodes instead, that's weaker, but good enough if you assume that the majority of nodes are honest.
So the idea of a blockchain is that you're doing replication on a semantic level, using originally submitted data pieces and explicit votes. So it's not in any way tied to low-level details of DB operation, in principle you can use different dbms on different nodes and it should still work fine.
But BigchainDB cheats here by using DB replication mechanisms instead of doing blockchain-style replication. The block meta-data is still there, so in principle you _could_ replicate it into a completely separate instance and do full verification. They store all the necessary data, but just don't use it in the normal course of operations.


You're achieving Byzantine fault tolerance. That is, if one of your nodes is hijacked by an attacker it won't be able to mess with your data.
Performance penalties might be actually minimal, as you just store and compute some meta-data. You're supposed to store full data. But that's something which many databases used for accounting purposes already do.


Blocks are sort of like checkpoints: once in a while you check that everybody is one the same page. It isn't supposed to add a huge overhead.
Blockchain users are supposed to be OK with some confirmation latency. E.g. in Bitcoin average confirmation latency is 10 minutes. In a private blockchain it might be down to seconds, or sub-seconds.
But still, I don't think you're going to get confirmation latency down to millisecond or microsecond levels.

If you want a client which runs as a program on Windows then, well, it is simply not possible. At all. No amount of ingenuity can make it "very secure", just as billions Microsoft spends on Windows cannot make it secure.
If program runs on Windows and Windows is compromised then program cannot be safe.
There are ways to alleviate the problem a little, but I would not describe any of them as "very secure".
So to get better security you need some kind of trustworthy device.
For example, if you boot from LiveCD you can make your computer about as trustworthy as that CD is. Is it too hard?
Another way to do this is multi-factor authorization, i.e. using your smartphone as a wallet.
Private keys will be kept on a smartphone and if you need to send money you need to authorize transaction with this smartphone.
But if smartphone itself will be lost it is not a problem if keys is encrypted with password residing on the windows computer.
So attacker will have to get access to both devices to steal money.
Makes sense, no?

Proof-of-stake and "coin voting" are two different things.
1. For proof-of-stake you want signer to have something on stake. Usually coins will be converted to 'stake', or immobilized in a certain way, and only after that they will participate in a consensus mechanism. So you can always see an amount of stake which is actually involved. (Stake can be confiscated if wrongdoing is detected, that's the point.)
2. For "coin voting" you might want to enable delegation, i.e. owner of a coin will declare that a different key is going to vote. That secondary key won't be guarded as much, but that doesn't matter as it can be reset at any time.

Because we want to make it impossible to move money without consent of people who provided funds. This can be done using a cryptocurrency and a smart contract.

Users can connect prediction market to the real world data.
Let's consider a simplified example. Suppose there is a prediction market currency which can be used only on betting on US presidents. Each coin (UTXO) can be either in neutral or in betting state, and additionally it records a history of previous bets. Thus each coin is associated with `(bet, history)` tuple.
Suppose it is 2011 and I want to bet on Obama. So I buy some certain amount of currency in a neutral state and split it into `(Obama2012, [Obama2008, ...])` and `(Romney2012, [Obama2008, ...])` tokens. I then sell Romney2012 bet tokens on the market.
Now after Obama have won in 2012, I can turn my betting tokens into a neutral tokens, so they become `(null, [Obama2012, Obama2008, ...])`. I can then sell them on the market.
People who own Romney2012 can also turn their betcoins into neutral tokens, but their bet will be recorded in the history. And nobody will ever buy these tokens, as they are considered counterfeit, funny-money.
This will work if we assume that coins with correct history become a [Schelling point]( of this game: users will assume that other users buy coins with correct history, so tokens with the correct history will be traded for other currencies (such as Bitcoin).
(Schelling point also makes Bitcoin work: obviously, people can create clones of Bitcoin with different genesis blocks. But the real Bitcoin, the one which was started by Satoshi, is the Schelling point: people strongly prefer it to alternatives such as alt-coins, testnet coins etc, as everyone believes that everyone will prefer the original one.)
There might be people trading invalid tokens, it's their right, but they will be in a minority and will have minimal economic impact.
(Just like people trading alt-coins...)
Interesting, I originally designed this as a non-trivial use of colored coins. But it will be like an order of maginute easier to implement it on top of Ethereum than on colored coins, also with an Ethereum contract it will be easier to give coins a value in a secure and fair way.

I remember how back in 2011 I wanted to make a decentralized betting service using Bitcoin. I knew how to do it in theory: a server will publish a hash preimage depending on the outcome, and that will unlock one or another transaction. (Now I know that it's better to do that with private key reveals a la reality keys.)
But I didn't know how to make it in practice. There was no wallet support for non-standard transactions. bitcoind and bitcoin-qt didn't even work with multi-sig transactions. Also non-standard transactions are forbidden, so you gotta petition Gavin &amp; co to make your app working even if you develop your own wallet or something.
I though that it was too much for me so I went to do something else.
Now, on the other hand, with Ethereum, when I had some idea, I spent 30 minutes and deployed it on the network. Then I could work with this contract using a standard Ethereum wallet (Mist).
So that's a difference. No need to petition anybody or ask people to add features to wallets. Very easy to go from idea to implementation. This is what I would call permissionless innovation.
Perhaps Bitcoin will win by being less bloated or something. But you can't deny that Ethereum has value for app builders (if anything, for easy prototyping).

1. Moonbeam is hub-to-hub payments. It will only be significant if hubs, like Coinbase, support it. And you need several hubs, obviously. The tech isn't new, it's basic payment channel stuff, just with a cool name. The reason it wasn't developed earlier is that it seems like hubs weren't interested, and with no interest from hubs it's pointless.
2. Alt-coins do not need segwit because they have very low transaction volume. It only makes sense for payment-oriented coins, none of one's you mentioned are, except maybe Litecoin. Dash already has instant-payments tech and it doesn't seem to be a gamechanger.
3. Cross-chain atomic swapping is very slow. We knew how to do it for ~5 years, but nobody is interested. A more pragmatic solution is to use multi-sig with a broker and payment channels. Matt Bell made an implementation, but it doesn't seem to get much interest.
I really doubt "all alt-coins" will be a competitor, more likely 1-2 alt-coins will offer good UX, and that would be enough. All technical contraptions (like cross-chain atomic swapping) made UX worse, so they are irrelevant.

If nodes will be run by organizations which have some budget for it, 100,000 transactions per second won't be a major problem either. It is possible even with current hardware: according to the data on the wiki page, you'll need a computer (or a cluster of computers) with 7 CPUs and 400 Mb/s.
This is something you can easily buy now. Sure, it might cost as much as $10,000, but that's not much to be able to hand worldwide traffic, is it?
And with future advances in technology we'll be able to handle more than 1 transaction per person per day, eventually.

A federated system which requires a consensus among nodes is definitely more secure than "let's just trust each other". In the later case a single server breach can destroy the system, it's not the way to go.
A blockchain is a simplest way of Byzantine fault tolerant synchronization among multiple parties, which is needed for a federated consensus system.

Why not? 
Bitcoin policy restricts number of transactions per second because it is supposed to be accessible by anyone (i.e. running a node shouldn't be too expensive), and is supposed to work for indefinite time (decades, centuries, etc). So Bitcoin is very conservative, so to speak.
But private blockchains have no such restrictions. They might deal with, like 10 nodes, each run by a different organization. They might allow high tps if they happen to need it. So RethinkDB might make sense in some contexts.
But it would make much more sense if every node had its own DB instance.

Each Bitcoin node has a list of currently unspent coins. This list is synchronized via the block chain (i.e. you can re-build this list from a history of all transactions).
So if you create a fake coin... every node will be able to recognize that it is fake as it is not in the list.
If you duplicate your wallet... You'll have two identical coins. After you spend it on one computer, it will be evicted from the list, so you won't be able to spend it again...

The main idea behind Bitcoin is that proof-of-work can be used to establish a global consensus. The more proof-of-work is added on top of a certain block, the less likely it becomes that it will be reversed, and harder it becomes to reverse it. So at some point you might get to a point that it is extremely unlikely that a block will be reversed, and reversing it would be prohibitively expensive. Thus we have a stochastic global consensus over the content of blocks which have enough 'confirmations'. 
This can be used to prevent double-spending in crypto-money systems, and this is what differentiates Bitcoin from other systems of this kind.
In the original Bitcoin paper, Satoshi did a calculation for some values of parameters, and got to a conclusion that 6 confirmations offer a fairly good irreversibility guarantee under those assumptions. Thus a Bitcoin payment is usually confirmed within a hour or two, which makes it useful for things like international money transfers, online purchases or, say, large-scale purchases.
However, if you explain this new currency/payment system to an ordinary person, most certainly he will ask you whether it is possible to buy groceries with it, or pay in a restaurant, as those are things which people interact with most frequently.
If it takes approximately one hour to validate a Bitcoin payment (this is what the Bitcoin paper essentially says), it is not _directly_ suitable for in-person transactions where you need a confirmation in matter of seconds. But, as a payment system, Bitcoin is very flexible and extensible. Thus it is possible to design a payment protocol on top of this which will fix this issue in one way or another. So this issue can be fixed, in principle, it is just that commonly used Bitcoin wallets are capable of doing basic transactions for now.
This answer might be too complex for an average person... "Oh, so it can't replace credit cards? I don't see this catching up anytime soon." Thus for some reason mainstream acceptance became associated with credit-card-replacement kind of use. (Apparently international payments and online purchases are not mainstream enough.)
Thus a lot of Bitcoin enthusiasts who were eager to see mainstream acceptance as soon as possible adopted "fake it till you make it" approach.  As it turns out, _as long as miners run unmodified Bitcoin node software, making double-spends is hard.
This allowed people to come up with explanations as to why Bitcoin is actually usable for in-person transactions: double-spending is hard, somebody who wants buying a burger can't do it. And miners have an incentive to keep using unmodified Bitcoin node software, as it makes Bitcoin more useful. Thus, as long as merchants take some precautions, it is perfectly fine to accept 0-confirmation transactions.
All of this is just a wishful thinking, not backed by any hard guarantees. It can change any time, e.g. a mining pool might start accepting double-spends and release wallet software which will make double-spending easy. (I.e. a double-spend transaction would be automatically sent to this pool.)
Yet people who are eager to see widespread adoption right now keep insisting that accepting 0-confirmation payments is OK and they attack anybody who says otherwise.
On the other hand, there are several different school of thoughts among Bitcoin (core) developers. Some of them believe that it would be necessary to build systems _on top_ of the Bitcoin core protocol to achieve mass adoption. Other believe that the existing peer-to-peer protocol can be improved over time. 
All of them agree that improvements are necessary, yet some believe that "fake it till you make it" is acceptable.
But is it acceptable in cryptographic software? E.g. imagine it was encryption software which is known to be secure for 1024-bit key size, but might be break-able when 128-bit keys are used. Will it be acceptable for developers to allow users to use 128-bit keys, if it is convenient?
Anyway, Peter Todd is among the people who advocate a serious approach based on strong theoretical foundations and no happy-go-lucky "fake it till you make it" stuff.
Of course, people who wish Bitcoin to replace US dollar ASAP are angry at Peter for exposing insecurity of 0-confirmation payments. Of course, if his replace-by-fee patches are adopted, Bitcoin will be demonstrably unusable for in-person payments, Bitcoin wallets won't replace credit cards, and we won't get $10000 USD per BTC anytime soon. So people are angry at him for "damage" he's trying to inflict.
But won't it be more damaging if Bitcoin developers will try to hide un-security of 0-confirmation payments and it will hit merchants once Bitcoin is more widely adopted?
Won't it be more damaging if development of improved protocols will be delayed by the sense of false security?

That means that you need to keep up with around 8 megabits/second of transaction data (2000tps * 512 bytes) / 1024 bytes in a kilobyte / 1024 kilobytes in a megabyte = 0.97 megabytes per second * 8 = 7.8 megabits/second.
You know, you can do that with Fast Ethernet... Which was introduced in 1995. Literally two decades ago.
Nah, the real problem is UTXO set size. In the worst case you'll have 21\*10^6 \*10^8 = 21\*10^14 UTXOs, with, say, 100 bytes per UTXO that would be 21\*10^16 bytes.
That is 210000 TB. And you need to have that in low-latency storage (to be able to verify large blocks in a reasonable time), magnetic disks aren't suitable.

Probably not, it might be OK for a very crude approximation, but they are fundamentally different, of course. You can't sell your job, for example. :)
Private equity might be closer. E.g. suppose John Smith owns shares of a private company. These shares are not traded on the market so it's hard to say what is their value, but they pay dividends, let's say around $50k a year. Company's management says that they expect this kind of dividends for some time, but they can't guarantee anything.
That's actually pretty typical. Now what changes if John is the CEO of a company? Probably, nothing. It is pretty common for a CEO of a company to own a stake in it.
But what if John is a sole owner? And what if the income comes from John's work?
I think it's actually pretty common for a contractors to do business through a company they own.
So contractor's income is practically indistinguishable from private equity.
Regular employment is different, strictly speaking. However, it is not uncommon to have contractors working as de-factor employees, so the differences is thin.

From investors perspective, Bitcoin might be too small of a niche. Bitcoin "market cap" is only $4 billion now, and Bitcoin economy can't be much bigger than that. And this economy is split among all the players, which are numerous. So why would you target niche of a niche?
There is, of course, a possibility of Bitcoin becoming much bigger. However, few investors are comfortable with betting on that. Basically you have to bet _both_ on the startup you're betting on and on Bitcoin, and odds are worse than just betting on a startup.
Of course, there are companies which are doing well, e.g. Coinbase. But that doesn't mean it makes sense to fund another hundred of payment processors, there is simply no market for them. We don't really need a bubble in the Bitcoin startup space, do we?
On the other hand, "blockchain" companies might target other, bigger markets, so they might be more attractive for investors. The question is not whether it is the best thing since sliced bread, but whether it is a legitimate innovation, an improvement over status quo.
Do we really need a hundred of startups to do "peer-to-peer transfer of value", what exactly are they going to do?
End users will be better off being serviced by open source software, not startups.
So why not both? We can have both Bitcoin companies and "blockchain" companies, and some of "blockchain" companies might directly or indirectly help Bitcoin ecosystem to mature.

Inflation promotes spending, but is it a good thing? It essentially forces people to buy things they don't really need  yet just because their money will be less valuable in future.
This is wasteful. If we want a sustainable economy, we want to minimize use of resources, and, thus, minimize spending. People/businesses should only buy stuff they really need.
Economists are generally trying to maximize GDP, but is that a good thing? 
There is so-called Clothesline Paradox: if someone attempts to save energy by using clothesline for drying clothes, he won't pay for energy and thus GDP will be lower than in case of using a dryer.
So, is saving energy bad for the economy, is it bad for a country? Is it bad that fossil fuel wasn't burned?
It seems that GDP is a very flawed metric, so maybe it makes no sense to use it to make long-term policy decisions.

Well, evolutionary optimization isn't really feasible for something like Bitcoin, because it really takes hundreds of millions dollars to secure the blockchain. We cannot spam thousands of them: if we do that, they won't be secure.
It's true that we have many blockchains now, but not a thousand. (If we count only serious ones.)
And thus the bulk of evolution has to be done within human minds. It is called modelling. We can consider many possible variants and consider what happens. Of course, models aren't perfect, but it's better than nothing.
And we need to know what to optimize for.
So it's more likely that we'll see a natural evolution _of optimization goals_, not blockchains. If blockchain X is optimized for quality A, and blockchain Y is optimized for quality B and so on, the one which will dominate depend son which quality is the most relevant to real world survival. Quite likely different blockchains will occupy different niches. (Of course, we don't optimize for a single quality, but instead have a complex structure of priorities and preferences.)
Thus a discussion about choice of qualities makes a lot of sense. The community needs a common understanding of the priorities.
Gavin Andresen openly said that he doesn't know what will be the mechanism to secure Bitcoin in future. Mike Hearn said that Bitcoin can work only as long as miners are benevolent rather than just rational (more specifically, that miners should cooperate to achieve long-term stability.
Do we subscribe to the vision of these guys? If we assume that miners actually care about the future of Bitcoin, it becomes much easier to optimize for performance.
Or should we optimize for the worst case, should we try to make a system which will work even if miners are greedy and inept fuckers? 
If you've been around the GHASH.IO debacle (when it reached 50% of total hash power after months of discussion), some miners came here and explained that they bought expensive hardware which will become obsolete soon, so they are mining on the biggest pool which has least variance to get max of it. Yes somehow they were caring so much about variance after they engaged in a highly risky endeavor of getting mining hardware. I don't even...

All nodes need to have a complete UTXO set (set of all unspent transaction outputs) to be able to verify transactions. You can't change this fact without fundamental changes to Bitcoin protocol.
Historic parts of the blockchain are largely irrelevant for scalability. Yes, they occupy space on disk, but nodes can prune them away. Ideally they can be kept in some soft of a DHT to allow needs nodes to scan the blockchain.
The main scalability problem is the time it takes to download and process the block (miners have an incentive to make it as short as possible). Another potential problems are bandwidth requirements and UTXO set storage.
On-disk blockchain size is a trivial issue. (Unless you're running a block explorer, then it's a nightmare.)

A simple P2PKH address (e.g. 15htCh6Jpp4z1ptFCLLpmd4f4qnKbUTBQm) is just a 160 bit number, i.e. a number between 0 and `2^160 - 1`. Since private keys are 256-bit numbers, then there are approximately `2^94` private keys per address. So there is no such as "an address that doesn't exist". They all exist, mathematically.
However, people do not know how to map addresses to private keys in general (aside from cases when person have generated said address from a private key himself). So, for example, address 0 is a valid address, but it's just statistically unlikely that anyone will find the corresponding private key in the next billion years or so. (Unless there is a mathematical breakthrough which lets one to crack RIPEMD-160, SHA-256 and ECDSA.)
So all such addresses have to be considered valid on the protocol level.
But there are provably unspendable outputs, which need to be constructed in a particular way. Recovering bitcoins from provably unspendable outputs is theoretically possible, but that would require a hard fork, so that's very unlikely.
Also some bitcoins were destroyed by miners, who just didn't grab the fees.

If one person wins in a lottery, does it mean that buying lottery tickets is rational? No. If your model is stochastic then studying just one case is not enough.
Output of your experiment greatly depends on behaviour of bitcoin chart. Something might be profitable in May but unprofitable in June.
The only useful output from your experiment would be cost estimates. Then if we'll get expected bitcoin value growth model we will be able to tell whether growth covers costs or not.
Or if you'll be able to sustain this experiments for years we could say that fluctuations got averaged out and result is significant.

And the other guy, Lerner, volunteered to write a BIP, but he didn't understand how it works, so he described it incorrectly.
So people working on segwit2x are just too incompetent to do it. This isn't vitriol, this is a verifiable fact.
I'm not going to run a node modified by incompetent people, I'll stick to Core.
Most likely HF will be called off after segwit locks. Many people involved in NYA are pragmatic, they don't want a chain split. Seeing that most nodes keep using Core, they will call it off. There are HF proposals from Core people which offer continuous growth, and most likely people will focus on them.
I won't be surprised if many people involved in NYA planned it to happen this way. If they actually wanted HF they would have made HF and SW to happen at the same time. But they didn't.

Well it definitely has nothing to do with max block size limit, as miners aren't reaching even the limits they configured themselves, let alone the hard limit.
The problem is probably that block subsidy is too high so miners do not care about transaction fees that much. They might get somewhat more rational after halving.

Electrum doesn't connect to Bitcoin network directly, it connects through one of Electrum servers. You can run your own server or use one provided by volunteers. Electrum servers are also Bitcoin nodes, I think won't be hard to launch XT-based one. The client side doesn't care about block size.

CW's speech is rather incoherent and he has very superficial understanding of cryptography. For example, consider his interview with GQ: he seems to be oblivious of a basic fact that a private key can be found if `k` using in ECDSA signature is produced by a flawed PRNG. This is a basic fact which you can find on wikipedia, yet he yells at the real cryptographer who brought it up.
He plagiarised content for his blog. He wrote a lot of words, but none of them show more than a superficial understanding.
This is very different from Satoshi's writings: they are never pompous like CW's writings, but always show great understanding.
So to me it's clear that CW isn't the same person who write "the whitepaper" and forum posts attributed to Satoshi.
Suppose there was "Team Satoshi". CW isn't the guy who wrote the code, and he isn't the guy who wrote the paper, and he isn't the guy who talked on forum. So who he was? Chief bullshitter?
Of course, it's possible that CW is actually Satoshi, but he pretends not to be Satoshi, while also claiming to be Satoshi.

I disagree.
$61 millions traded each day mostly just cancel each other.
If miners are consistently selling, it creates a stead downtrend, unless other people people also invest $1 million/day to cancel it.
Moreover, if investors are aware of this downtrend, they will postpone investing.
I think this model explains the behavior we're observing. We have huge price spikes (when a lot of people decide to buy bitcoins approximately at the same time), followed by downtrends.

Internet was created in 70s, way before the web appeared. 20 years ago internet was 20 years old.


You see it from the perspective of people from rich, "first-world" countries. The banking/payment system works very well in these countries, so there is, indeed, no incentive to switch to Bitcoin.
But, for example, I live in Ukraine, where banks aren't so trustworthy... We have a news of another bank going belly up pretty much each week, and it might take months or years for people to get their money back, as the government has no money to compensate immediately. Add to this that the compensation is currently limited to about $8000.
When you know that banks can't be trust from personal experience, a decentralized system not based on trust becomes immediately appealing.
The actual problem with Bitcoin in this context is the 'volatility': it is not a reliable store of value.
While it is true that credit cards work very well for people in US and EU, there are BILLIONS of people who could benefit from Bitcoin, if it was stable enough.

SegWit transactions include signature just like normal transactions. They just use a different format, so txid doesn't hash the signature. I.e. it affects only how transaction identifiers are computed. It doesn't affect security.
SegWit transaction format is deliberately backward compatible, i.e. old nodes can still make sense of a transaction in the new format when it's prepared in a particular way. This seems to be confusing users like you.
This downconversion to older format will be completely irrelevant once SegWit is activated. How likely do you think it is for all nodes in Bitcoin network to be switched back to version 0.12?

Max block size is a hard protocol constant, you can't increase it without a hard fork. Everyone will have to upgrade nodes.

When you're working with security-related software, you should focus on negatives.
Pretty much all security research is about attacks. A cipher is good when it's hard to break, and to know if it's hard to break we need to know what attacks are possible.
Google made an important contribution by demonstrating SHA1 collision. It doesn't matter if better hash functions exist if people keep using non-secure ones. So it's very important to point out flaws.
There's already a plenty of technical articles about BU shortcomings, but not everybody can understand them.
We need people to understand that BU is beyond ridiculous. It's not an isolated flaws, but a devious combination of bad ideas, technical ineptitude and sick attitude.
Whether you're for small blocks or big blocks, you gotta recognize that BU is a ridiculous crap, and you need to make conclusions about people who push it. (Why would you push an obvious crap? You're either too stupid to recognize it, or are malicious.)
We shouldn't just ignore BU. It is a good opportunity for us to identify bad actors who would otherwise stay undetected.

The whole point of the Bitcoin protocol is to prevent double-spending, i.e. make it impossible to counterfeit bitcoins.
As far as I know, there was only one case in the modern Bitcoin history when a "fully confirmed" transaction (6 confirmations) was reversed. I'd say that's pretty damn reliable.
And the block size is directly relevant here: if you remove protocol-wide block size limit then nodes will have to impose ad-hoc limits dictated by hardware, thus lack of consensus is likely.

This is true for RSA ^* , but not for ECDSA. ECDSA is a digital signature algorithm, it has no notion of encryption/decryption.

You can do EC-based encryption/decryption using ECIES, but it uses different formulas.

The fact that Garzik fucked up is a fact that is recorded in git history of that branch.
The problem was that Garzik didn't bother to learn how SegWit patch works before starting his work. Most likely he over-estimated his confidence.
He just _assumed_ that it worked in a certain way instead of actually learning how it works. And since he wasn't involved in development and wasn't communicating with other devs, he wasn't aware of his mistake until it was almost too late.
Working on consensus-critical parts of Bitcoin code requires a specific mindset -- you need to maintain _identical_ behavior. I don't think your average kernel hacker will instantly get it. You know, in kernel things can change over time, they do not even bother maintaining stable ABI. But this is not acceptable in Bitcoin.
So, anyway, I'm not saying Garzik is too dumb to work on this. But he's too reckless.
Same is Sergio, he did the same mistake as Jeff.
That's another bad sign -- communication is very poor in that team, people barely understand what they are doing and care very little about results.

Yep, it has an additional stabilizing effect as more dollars flow in during a slump.
A person who already has bitcoins might help stabilizing the price if he buys and sells bitcoins to make them a constant fraction of his portfolio. E.g. he might decide to keep 10% of his portfolio in bitcoins. If the bitcoin price falls their value in portfolio falls, so he buys some. If the bitcoin price goes up he will sell some to keep them at 10%. This helps to stabilize the price.
Meni Rosenfeld once mentioned that a target fraction of Bitcoin in his portfolio is a function of the bitcoin price, so basically Bitcoin's share grows as price goes up, but there's some diversification too. That helps to stabilize the price too, but is more biased towards growth.
Anyway, I think pretty much everything except panic buying/selling is OK, DCA is just a widely known and easily understood method, also easy to execute if one has a stable income. (VA might be more problematic if it requires you to spend more money than you have.)

No, they do NOT need to be absorbed. Mempool isn't a persistent thing. Only those nodes which have minrelaytxfee at 0.00001 BTC/KB even see them. Miners configured a higher minrelaytxfee, that's why none of them have been confirmed for a while. And the recommended minrelaytxfee is now 0.00005 BTC/KB. As soon as everybody sets it, they will just disappear.
Also, new version of Bitcoin Core will forget mempool transactions after 72 hours.
So again, this is spam which is stuck in mempool of misconfigured nodes, eventually it will be forgotten.
And BTW stress test organizers can easily rescan their wallet and submit their transactions with higher fees, orphaning that crap in mempool.

It's not a waste, if you're sending to a single recipient value of outputs is significantly lower than the fee so you can interpret it as a slightly higher fee.
It might matter if you want asset to hundreds or thousands of recipients. But those distribution transactions are basically indistinguishable from UTXO bloat spam. So I think it's OK that there is a cost.

Well, "medium of exchange" means "being used for trade". But that is not requirement for asset to be valuable.
Say, dollars aren't used for trade in Ukraine. In fact, laws explicitly forbid that. But you can easily exchange between dollars and local currency, and thus dollars are a highly liquid asset, and are considered money.
Same thing gold. It's not used for trade (for the last hundred of years or so), but it's still quite liquid and valuable.
So as long as Bitcoin is exchange-able, it's OK if it's not used for trade.

Ripple is more like a BFT shared ledger. It's not a general purpose database. And it was clearly inspired by Bitcoin, as it has blocks which are organized into a chain. Stellar is same as Ripple.
Hyperledger Fabric (known as IBM OpenBlockchain before the rebranding) is still under development. It might be a general purpose BFT shared database, indeed.
My point is that "Shared databases have been around since the mid-70ies" is not quite true. **Secure** shared databases are being developed right now, and they are clearly inspired by Bitcoin.
Non-secure shared databases are just a terrible idea and no wonder they aren't in use.

The most recent invention powering Bitcoin is proof-of-work, it was first described in 1997 (hashcash, Adam Back), although it might have existed before that as an idea.
Public key cryptography and hashing are much older concepts, somebody could implement something similar to Bitcoin using different digital signatures and hash functions in 80s.
So I think somebody could make a Bitcoin proof-of-concept in 80s, if he could invent proof-of-work along the way. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 15:20:17


The whole point of the blockchain is that it is validated by every full node. So, by definition, it doesn't need to be "managed by trusted entities".
However, besides validation you other need a way to select a single blockchain among the many. Bitcoin solves this through proof-of-work, but it's also possible to solve it using a centralized timestamping service.
Note that there is a huge difference between "[a ledger] managed by trusted entities" and a centralized timestamping service. One thing is that any kind of tampering will be: 1) evident; 2) provable.
So my opinion is that blockchains provide a lot of benefits even if they are based on a centralized timestamping service. One thing they'll lack is automatic conflict resolution... Basically, a Bitcoin blockchain can keep going no matter what, but a centralized blockchain might get stuck and would require some manual resolution.

No, bank cannot lend more than $100 when $100 was deposited. 
That $900 might be a result of a process where bank lends money, it gets deposited again, then is lent again and so on.
But if borrower takes cash then you have no such process.
Also, in practice, it is limited by willingness of people to deposit money, take loans, and willingness of banks to offer loans. E.g. during 2008 financial crisis banks were reluctant to offer loans so M1 money supply was shrinking.
(BTW EU bank reserve requirements are only 1%, thus in theory $100 might generate up to $10000 of "new money". In some countries reserve requirements [just do not exist](

This won't work: there is exchange price spread, there is volatility, there is exchange fee, there is money transfer fee. When you add this all it will be much higher than credit card processing fees.
You can pass these fees onto users, but you can do the same with CC processing...


But it can change in time between user gets quote and time of exchange. Sometimes change will cancel out, sometimes it won't. There is a risk.
Either merchant will take this fee, or payment service will take this risk, but then it will need to use fees to cover it.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

It's the same thing. $100 go in, $100 go out. You can call that $100 which goes out "new money", but it is a matter of a terminology.


From the accounting perspective, "the money in your account" is what bank owes you. That is, you gave bank a loan. It's not money, it's a loan. That's how it looks like from the bank's perspective too: deposits are liabilities.
We are just used to think that what bank owes us is money, because typically bank can return it on demand, and thus it is almost as good as having money in a safe.
However, the way we think of it doesn't change the nature of bank's business. It's just a matter or terminology.


It's also limited by willingness of people to deposit money and take loans. Banks cannot "create money" when deposits aren't being made, and they cannot earn money when people do not take loans.

This is kinda irrelevant when you consider a bigger picture.
Suppose 100k BTC exists on a sidechain which generate 1000 BTC per year in miners' rewards. Miners can choose either to steal the whole sum, or collect it over the next 100 years. So from a game-theoretic point of view, it is a very simple choice: unless you have a sidechain with extreme velocity &amp; fees, it's always more profitable to get the whole sum.
Also note that in the case of merged-mined sidechains, there are no electricity costs (miners gotta spend that electricity on mining bitcoins anyway), so we have a very basic game-theoretic model as described above.

But Bitcoin price is 80% up since May 2015!
Suppose people borrowed bitcoins from you and converted that to USD to spend. Then they used their income, which is in USD, to buy bitcoins to pay back then loan.
In this case, they had to pay back 80% more USD than they borrowed. So the _real_ interest rate was through the roof. That might led to elevated default rate.
So if you see it that way:
1. The real value (measured in dollars, bread, gold, whatever you like) of your investment have increased.
2. BTCJam might work much better when BTC price isn't increasing.
3. It's not necessarily good deal for borrowers due to Bitcoin's volatility.

BigchainDB relies on RethinkDB's internal sharding for performance. Essentially, it's just an app which checks data before adding it to DB.


Transactions are batched into blocks. With high tps you'll just have bigger blocks. Having a fast storage layer helps to process big blocks faster.
Generally a leader creates a block (in case of Bitcoin the leader is determined using a lottery-like mechanism), the the rest of nodes verify it. That is, they need to:
1. receive transactions over a network
2. verify them
3. update the data store
All these things scale quite well, i.e. if you have fast networking, good CPU and fast data store, you'll be able to verify a lot of transactions per second.

There are no technical reasons to keep it exactly at 1 MB, it's too low for wider adoption.
The question isn't whether it should be increased, the question is _when_ to increase it and how much.
There are two groups of developers. One want to take a conservative approach and wait until we'll have complete understanding of this subject. They believe that blocks filling up is not a big deal as users can adjust their use patterns. (Also it's a chance to observe fee market, which is useful for future.)

This is absolutely NOT true. In his [2013 video on Bitcoin scaling]( Peter Todd says that block size increase is not necessary, and off-chain payments can be used to solve scaling.
Perhaps you are talking about an average redditor who has no clue, but people who know the tech knew that there is no need to buy coffee on-chain.

On the other hand, Bitcoin exchanges can do cross-border transfers without partnering with anyone, that's the beauty of it. As for bank-exchange relationship, I don't know. Perhaps a more likely scenario is that bitcoin exchanges will directly offer remittance service disrupting banks' business.

Do you understand that Bitcoin "3 tps" limit is simply a matter of policy, not a limit of underlying software?
bitcoind is able to process something on scale of 4 MB/s on a desktop-class hardware, this corresponds to 20000 tps if we assume smallest transactions like BigchainDB test did. On a high-end server-class hardware you'll get much more.
bitcoind's underlying storage is LevelDB, which is plenty fast.

8 Mb/s is the data stream we need to deal with.


Uh, why? It is unnecessary to send same data twice.


Maybe in your imagination. In reality nodes only advertise transaction hashes, and other nodes request transaction data only if they haven't seen it before.
But that's not the best we can do, obviously. Matt Corallo implemented a synchronization protocol which keeps track of what other nodes know to minimize traffic.


We are talking about bandwidth requirements. Obviously, if you have a 8 Mbit/s data stream, you need a pipe which is bigger than that to accommodate for overhead and whatnot.
E.g. 20 Mbit/s would allow some redundancy and provide some bandwidth for those who are bootstrapping.
But anyway, the point is, it isn't going to be the bottleneck.

Government is not a single entity. It (usually) consists of legislative, executive and judicial branches.
Legislative branch is decentralized, as each law needs to be approved by the majority of representatives. (And then in US you also get federal vs state laws.)
Judicial branch is also decentralized, in the sense that each decision might be reviewed by multiple independent judges. E.g. you have the initial trial, appeal and so on.
So I'd say it is pretty much as decentralized as it gets unless you go for direct democracy (aka mob rule).
I'd say that the issue is that people are generally disinterested in politics. If there were millions of people outraged with asset forfeiture, I'm sure something could be made about it. But instead of that voters prefer to focus on so-called 'wedge issues'. Sadly, an average person is quite dumb.

Only in metaphoric sense. Real emergence is when complex behavior arises from relatively simple rules. But people do not follow "simple rules", they try to behave rationally, which can be extremely complex by itself.
A better name for this is a [focal point]( This is a concept in game theory: if players can maximize their payoff by choosing the same thing, they will try to think what the other player expects them to do.
It is fairly easy to show that use of emergence is impossible on non-mining node level:
1. it is impossible to see what other nodes are doing because of a possibility of Sybil attack, thus node should make decisions without regard of what its peers are doing, which is no emergence
2. emergence arises from following rules, but if rules aren't enforced, you cannot expect nodes to follow the rules when it's controlled by a sentient operator
So EC is a sham, unless we are talking about a completely different consensus model like PoS.

Based on what? Do you have competence to analyze consensus algorithms?


How is it even supposed to work?
Peter R. tells us that nodes will indicate what size they can accept.
But this is a lie. A default BU node indicates that it will accept _arbitrarily large_ blocks after 2 hours of delay.
So there is no "emergent consensus", big miners decide on size of blocks.
So-called EC algorithm isn't used as a decision algorithm among miners either, it just doesn't work that way. As Jihan Wu admitted, "the best practice of EC" is for miners to coordinate block size increase out of band (i.e. in a conference) and switch to it at a certain height.
So de-facto EC simple shoves big blocks decided by miners down the throat of consumers. There is nothing emergent about it.

Ethereum is a huge project, it takes MANY years to get to actual results. If you sold after one year, you just had no idea what it is and how it works. You're a day trader just gambling on coins.

The abomination designed by Mike Hearn has nothing to do with SPV. It is utterly fucking retarded, you don't really need a calculator to understand that non-indexed queries are going to be very inefficient and do not scale.
So forget about Bloom filters, it was a brainfart.
Perhaps it makes sense to take a look how other p2p projects scale. Many of them (BitTorrent, eMule, ...) use distributed hash tables (DHTs) to host vast amounts of data. The idea is to split the data into multiple chunks and then put chunks on multiple participating nodes.
So as a first step, you can put `(txid, txdata)` pairs into the DHT.
But you also need to allow clients to find transactions. To do that, you  can use "UTXO commitments", particularly, one might build a merklized trie for `(height . address, txids)` data and put the root hash into a block, while uploading nodes into the DHT.
Then a thin client can simply perform DHT queries to find relevant txids and transactions.
Patricia trie implementation can be found in Ethereum, it's not really a rocket science, several hundreds of lines of Python code maybe. It's already used by Ethereum light clients, and it seems to scale quite well.
For DHT you can take any of implementations and just upload data into it. It can be 100% separate from normal Bitcoin p2p implementation.
It's much easier to run a DHT node than a full node (since you host a tiny amount of data), so you can integrate DHT nodes into thin clients themselves. It might not work very well on mobile, but desktop clients like Electrum would be perfect for it.
I'm not familiar with DHT privacy research, but given that you can query multiple different nodes, it probably won't be worse than Bloom filters, on contrary. If that's still a concern, throw some onion routing for DHT queries.

Well yes, this is basically what Rootstock is. No need to reinvent the wheel if it's possible to integrate EVM with Bitcoin.
There are other options too. But the biggest question is: Do we even need this?
Stateful scripts require more resources, they might lead to new DoS attacks, etc.
Bitcoin devs are very conservative and they prioritize payment applications. They believe that a lot of interesting features can be implemented without stateful scripts. (But, honestly, stuff I've seen so far is kinda underwhelming.)
Which isn't necessarily a wrong approach. People now can play with Ethereum, later Rootstock will enable Bitcoin smart contracts. And later maybe Bitcoin will extend script capabilities on the mainchain, but only after there is consensus over the best way to do that.

Mathematician here!


It definitely doesn't, it just illustrates how it works. Illustration is not a proof.
Then, what exactly are we proving here? Nobody doubts that ECDSA public key can be used to verify a signature produces with a ECDSA private key. That math is crystal clear.
But this: 


is just a conjecture. Computational complexity is still an area of active research, and, for example, it's still not known whether complexity class P is same as NP or not.
The problem is that there might be some computational shortcut which will let one to find a private key for a given public key, or produce a signature using a public key alone. Or find a preimate for a given hash value.
Currently it is not proven that these shortcuts do not exist.


If you claim that computational shortcuts are not possible, then you must provide a proof. This is how it works. (JFYI such a proof will be regarded as one of the biggest breakthroughs in mathematics, computer science and cryptography.)
And as you're wary of buttcoiners, I guess I need to mention my credentials:
 * [I've been writing Bitcoin software since 2012](
 * currently am a CTO of a Bitcoin startup
so clearly not a Bitcoin skeptic.
I just want to highlight that a blockchain-derived evidence is as solid as it gets (it's basically same as digital signatures which are officially recognized in all developed countries), but it is not a "mathematical proof". Mathematical proof has a very specific meaning. It might be regarded as a cryptographic proof, though, as cryptographic proofs work under certain assumptions.
Particularly, we must assume that 
 * it is computationally infeasible to find hash collisions or preimages for known hashes
 * user doesn't have enough computational power to rewrite a Bitcoin blockchain

Yes, right now it can only be deployed on the small scale and it will depend on arbitragers who move money by other means. It's a strict improvement over ordinary Bitcoin remittance as it locks exchange rate, but it's not something which can solve everything at once.
But if we consider a bigger vision, of course it would work much better if we have a single unified market both for small and big players. So remittance, import and export will work through the same market and will cancel each other. If there is still an imbalance, it will be a trade imbalance which will affect the currency itself.
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:28:52
You've got it backwards. Miners need to sell their coins to pay electricity bills. They _have_ to produce coins which are accepted by the market. As long as rational miners exist, they will mine the valid chain. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 20:39:04
Sorry, but simulating 400k payments between 10M users is not interesting. The whole point of LN is to reuse payment channel for multiple payments: setting up a channel is more expensive than sending a payment directly, so it makes sense only if you do, say, 10 payments over channel lifetime.
Particularly, an interesting case is when the volume of outgoing payment exceeds initial balance of the user.
If simulating 10M users is problematic, perhaps you can run simulation with smaller number of users.
Perhaps just 1000 users and 1M payments.

The wallet is connected to a computer which might be compromised. Wallet receives commands via USB. If a USB driver or a thing which processes that commands is buggy, it might send private key (or just signatures) over USB connection. Then the compromised computer will send it over internet.
If you never connect it to a computer and generate your own seed then sure, it cannot be compromised.
@_date: 2015-02-10 09:05:29


You should think in terms of desired properties of payments, e.g.
1. can't be censored/blocked
2. do not depend on trust
3. can be verified with mathematical certainty
4. underlying currency can't be inflated
All these things can be accomplished without publishing each payment as a separate transaction.

C++, Java and JavaScript are also "completely spec'd".
I love Common Lisp, but there are no Bitcoin libraries for Common Lisp (aside from a basic JSON-RPC API wrapper, maybe). So you'd have to implement everything from transaction parsing to ECDSA to protocol...
I actually started transaction parsing: 
That was easy. But then I need ECDSA, at minimum... At which point I said "fuck it" and switched to Python.
Ironically there is actually a complete Bitcoin implementation in Haskell: 
So if correctness is your highest priority it might be a good choice.

The main systemic risk for Bitcoin is a cryptanalytic breakthrough which would make ECDSA (or other cryptographic primitive used in Bitcoin) non-secure. If a theoretic weakness will be found before a practical attack is possible, we might have time to upgrade (but still, careless people might suffer). But we can't rule out the possibility that somebody comes up with a practical attack.
Another major systemic risk is possible loss of consensus... Basically, if total hashpower drops for some reason it might become feasible to attack Bitcoin consensus.
So I'd say it is not a wise idea to keep all your savings in Bitcoin, tbh.

6. They also claim that other messages were signed, but none of them are posted publicly. (Note that we don't need many messages, we need just one: "I am Craig Wright" signed by a key from the genesis block.)
7. Gavin "confirms" that Craig is Satoshi.

I don't see why. Also it might be not very "safe and practical", as it requires bringing coins out of cold wallet and splitting them, i.e. running through barely-tested, one-time temporary scripts. Not safe.
If we are to theoretize, I'd say that it is a duty of payment processors to control the definition of Bitcoin. The whole point of Bitcoin is that there is only one Bitcoin (i.e. it's all about preventing double-spending and having a consensus over the blockchain), so they should discourage forks. Allowing to withdraw forked coins acknowledges that forked coins are valid, which is against the idea of Bitcoin. Thus it's their duty to not deal with this bullshit.
(If you compare it with Ethereum Classic, that's a bit different since Ethereum Foundation encouraged users to make a choice, that acknowledging that two valid chains can exist at the same time. This is quite ironic, since user-defined tokens do not make sense when chain can be forked.)

Loss of servers shouldn't be a problem in a properly organized operation: data should be replicated to multiple remote locations, and hot wallet should be hosted in a separate heavily guarded location.
You only need _servers_ for trading proper (because you need high bandwidth &amp; performance to process orders). Hot wallet doesn't require much bandwidth. It can be an ordinary computer, just enough to run a full node. (Perhaps even Raspberry Pi-like device.)
So you can host a hot wallet in your office's building basement or something like that. Also hot wallet might be wiped out in case of an alarm going off.
Thus it shouldn't be a problem unless people are compromised.

Smart contracts can be confusing because the term is not well-defined. There are many different kinds of things which are called "smart contracts".
The general idea is that smart contracts are about:
 * automating the deal as much as possible
 * limit number of things which can go wrong and provide clear diagnostics
Even if you automate only a "happy case" where two parties have no disagreement, that's already a huge advantage compared to paper contracts, as you eliminate delays and human errors.
To address a case of a dispute, you can encode a way of conflict resolution, e.g. delegate resolution to a third party. In that case the advantage is that you don't need to go through a slow and expensive enforcement process, as a third party can authorize money transfer directly.


A classic solution is 2-of-3 multisig where keys are: buyer, seller and dispute mediator. When buyer and seller agree with each other, they just unlock the money and pay 0% fee. If they disagree then dispute mediator can side with one of the parties, taking a fee.
Compare this to eBay which charges a fee even if there is no dispute.
But is it a smart contract or just a multi-sig? I think multi-sig is the way of implementation, while the whole protocol is a smart contract.
You can go further by replacing a centralized dispute mediator (perhaps just one guy) with a more complex script which takes data from multiple sources, e.g. data from shipping company, notary, etc. Now that's definitely in the smart contract territory.


There are many vastly different cases. We don't know which of them are going to be the most fruitful.
Perhaps the most straightforward thing would be handling of financial bets, derivatives, etc. In this case the parties can design a custom contract with arbitrary complex logic. Data needed for resolution can be provided by banks who escrow the money.
The advantage here is that contracts can be 100% custom, and banks do not have any expenses. They do not need to read paper contracts, there is no risk for them -- they just provide data and run a computation.


Yes, that too. Gambling bet is same as financial bet, and there are literally trillions of dollars used in that kind of stuff.


There are many different approaches. E.g. in Bitcoin contracts, we typically only codify authorization structure (both for "happy case" and a conflict) on the blockchain, and handle the logic elsewhere (like in wallet software). In Ethereum model, they keep logic and data on chain.

@_date: 2015-03-28 20:25:43


OK, can you explain how exactly it is a problem?


You said that you want 7 billion of people to be able to transact. They'll need to own at least one coin each to be able to do that. If you need 100 bytes per one coin, you need 700 GB to store a complete UTXO set holding 1 coin per person.
Moreover, if you want them to be able to transact once per day, you need to keep 700 GB in a storage which is capable of doing 80000 IO operations per second.
At the same time, you need 80000 * 500 * 8 / 10^6 = 320 Mbit/s bandwidth.
So somehow bandwidth which was readily available on consumer-grade devices 10 years ago (e.g. I got a gigabit ethernet card built into a motherboard) IS a problem, but a storage capable of storing 700 GB while providing 100,000 IOP/s is not a problem, whatsoever!

And then, you know, Ethereum devs promise to implement PoS and sharding. It's still unknown if that's possible, but I think a lot of people are going to bet on Ethereum just for that reason.


There is a lot of hype, indeed. BTW I don't quite understand why crowdsales became bigger.
Mastercoin was the first one, and it got only $500k initially. It then swell up to $5M when BTC hit $1000. 
But now we have much bigger ones. E.g. Digix got $5M in matter of hours. TheDAO got $100M... That stuff is weird.
It's not like Mastercoin wasn't hyped, it promised nothing short of world domination. So something have changed since that time. I would guess that people get tired of crowdsales, but no, no signs of that.

I'm already betting heavily on Bitcoin: I keep 100% of my savings in Bitcoin and I've been working exclusively on Bitcoin-related projects for the last 3 years.
However, I can understand that people just aren't ready to switch to Bitcoin. It's way too experimental. Even Gavin says so. Core developers are still arguing how to scale it, etc.
I can understand that banks and governments cannot switch to Bitcoin and just aren't interested in it, but that doesn't mean that they cannot use more cryptography and transparency to eliminate some of the financial system risks, does it?
But I can't understand rabid zealots who keep only as little as 1% of their assets in Bitcoin but bark at everything which isn't pro-Bitcoin.
I hope that eventually Bitcoin will disrupt government-issued and bank-issued currencies, but it will take a lot of time to get there. People, not governments or banks, will push this change.
But changes from government side will also be beneficial. Why?
 * if government issues cryptocurrency, people will have secure hardware wallets, which can also be used to keep bitcoins and pay with them
 * people will get used to cryptocurrencies so it will be much easier to transition to Bitcoin
 * it's much easier to interoperate and convert when both sides are crypto-based

I switched to GNU/Linux 5 years ago; nevertheless, I'm going to defend WinXP here.
You assume that OS security is the duty of the OS vendor. This is reasonable, as user doesn't have to know anything about security. And so running an OS which doesn't receive security updates anymore is, indeed, risky...
However, an OS which regularly receives security updates is not necessarily secure. And hence security depends on user's behavior to a large degree.
WInXP had so many bugs and fundamental security flaws that its users had no choice but to learn about how it works under the hood in more details and secure it themselves.
The general idea is that if you disable a certain OS component (which you don't use), then you don't really care if it is patched or not.  In other words, you can try to eliminate possible attack vectors instead of eliminating software vulnerabilities.
And this is actually quite feasible.
Windows XP received hundreds (or even thousands) of security updates, but almost all of them fix attack surfaces which can be actually disabled or eliminated:
1. Networking.
2. Standard (pre-installed) software.
3. Windows Explorer.
4. Autorun.
5. Software already running on the system.
3-5 can be addressed in a trivial way: if you do not use removable media, do no download and install any new software, it cannot bite you. 2 is trivial as well: if you don't use software which comes with Windows, it is dormant and cannot bite you either.
And a trivial solution to 1 is to not use any networking, but that's not fun.
Networking, in general, has enormous attack surface. But it is very easy to eliminate it: disable all Windows-specific services.
TCP/IP implementation by itself is OK, it is fairly compact so it wasn't that hard to secure it.
However, Windows also runs a number of services and protocols, e.g. for discovering computers on LAN, browse their files, offer your own files for browsing and so on. And all of this is implemented in a very complex way, and is thus full of vulnerabilities.
So the thing is, if you only care about browsing the internets, you can disable all this shit altogether. All you need for browsing is outgoing TCP/IP connections.
So anyway, if we're betting on fully patched Windows 8 in default configuration vs. _properly secured_ WinXP, I would bet on WinXP any day (until a critical TCP/IP vulnerability is discovered).

Actually what matters is not Turing-completeness, but what state the language has access too.
Bitcoin output script is able to validate output generated by an input script against transaction hashes, and that's it. Input/output scripts are run in an environment which is completely isolated from the rest of the blockchain. The data they compute is only used to check if the spend is valid or not, then the data is discarded.
On the other hand, Ethereum scripts have read/write access to contract's state. Thus they can store data and check it later. This makes it possible to implement things like name registries, currency scripts, voting and so on: all these applications require state storage.
If you need to describe the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum scripts you can say that Bitcoin ones are stateless and Ethereum ones are stateful.

I don't think you understand how con artists work... They manipulate people.
E.g. suppose Gavin says "I want to verify signature on my laptop." 
And Craig will be like "Oh, sorry, I cannot give you a signature coz I'm afraid you will leak it... Too bad we cannot proceed with verification... Oh, wait, what if we buy a fresh laptop and then wipe it out?".
Gavin's choice is either to go home without verification, or to agree to this reasonable suggestion. Especially since he already believes the guy is SN. (Now I dunno how he managed to convince him, Craig's blog doesn't look convincing _at all_.) So Gavin agrees, and Craig is like "OK good, now my man will fetch us a fresh laptop from a store nearby, while we can continue chatting about the early days of Bitcoin."
Of course, it would be more reasonable for Gavin to choose a random store, choose a random brand and so on. But he doesn't want a confrontation.
So Gavin didn't request anything, he simply agreed to a set up provided by Craig. This wasn't some world class con job, the hardest part was probably to mod Electrum into verifying wrong signature.
Now with that blog post, Craig put a lot of effort into a replay attack. It's quite impressive for a guy who barely understands cryptography. But, of course, that's not going to trick professional cryptographers.
It's probably a Dunning-Kruger effect at work, Craig thinks that if he can fool Gavin he is god and can do everything. But he doesn't understand that people can easily see through the bullshit on his blog.
Perhaps he expected it to be debunked sooner or later, but wanted to create a "controversy".

There is a trade-off between supporting high transaction rate and making nodes cheap to run. You seem to want both at the same time, but it's not possible without re-inventing the whole thing.
So there is a number of options:
1. big blocks, few nodes
2. small blocks, payment channels and/or off-chain transactions
3. small blocks, many blockchains (divide-and-conquer)
4. some kind of a magic solutions. SNARKs, maybe?


Yes, so? Satoshi's point is that miners (mining pools in today terminology) will run "fully validating nodes" and everybody else will use SPV. Miners have an incentive to follow the rules so you can rely on them.
That's the idea. Read it twice if you do not understand.

Ryan's argument just makes no sense. So apparently there are some forums which are censored, what stops people from setting up other forums?
Censorship only works on government level, when there is a law which forbids free speech. This is fucking internet, everybody does whatever the fuck they want.
You don't like reddit? Spread "the truth" on twitter, for free.
And on another level, for censorship to affect the debate, people need to be isolated from "true" information. So what people are isolated from what information, exactly? 
We hear various hard fork proposals and whatnot here on pretty much every fucking day. So I'm sure even casuals aware of it. Moreover, we routinely link to and bitcoin.com where people have a chance to be exposed to truth.
And even if you think that censors this valuable information too, we routinely link to twitter, particularly Ryan F. Charles twitter account, where he has a chance to spread the truth.
So it's clear that people are **not** isolated from information.
Thus there are _only_ two possibilities: Ryan X. Charles is either a retard or a propaganda troll. So what is it, ? Are you a troll or a retard?
You need to understand that it takes a lot of time to gain reputation, but it takes only a moment to flush it down the toilet.

I definitely didn't miss anything. Currently it's only a slightly better form of a "Bitcoin remittance", which has exactly the problem with unbalanced payments.
But imbalance you mentioned exists because you only consider remittance. If you get importers to use the same system, it can become more balanced.
Now suppose some time in future everybody will use the system, both importers and exporters. Then people will use bitcoins the same way they use dollars now. All the same macroeconomic stuff applies, if balance of payments isn't neutral countries local currency might get devalued.
Obviously, Bitcoin can't fix local policies, but it can make cross-border payments faster and cheaper.

I tried running it several years ago on a really underpowered computer ^* -- 200 MHz, 64 MB RAM Pentium II -- and it worked quite well.
It's really mind-boggling that you can get a full Linux OS with a graphical desktop environment running a modern browser in just 64 MB or RAM. While normally just one Chrome tab requires more memory...
^*: If you wonder in what situation it could be relevant, in my case it was like that: There was a family which couldn't afford a computer for their school-age kid. One kind guy bought them an old computer and asked me to install stuff. It already had Windows 98 on its disk with an office and some games, so I just cleaned that up a little. However, they wanted internet too, which they could get by tethering a mobile phone. However, Windows 98 absolutely lacked USB drivers for that phone. Linux to the rescue! Puppy supported phone connection out of box, had connection app and a browser, so it was quite easy to run. However, it took me 20+ hours to install it in dual boot mode, as I had to iterate though different version to find one which both supports phone connections and has install &amp; boots scripts which work on that computer. Perhaps I even had to modify the scripts to make it working, I dunno. But in the end the kid got the computer with some short doc on how to do different things.

As name suggests, "law enforcement" enforces existing laws. They cannot create new ones, and thus they cannot outlaw something.
Regulators and lawmakers could effectively outlaw cryptocurrencies, but they don't, for a number of reasons:
1. A lot of people see cryptocurrencies as a major innovation, somewhat similar to Internet.
2. If cryptocurrencies are outlawed in one country, but in other countries they are allowed, that country will just miss on innovations.
3. They understand that if Bitcoin is outlawed, it will continue to be used illegally, and that's much harder to control than to control companies which operate in US.
4. There might be some strategic considerations, e.g. if Bitcoin is used to evade currency controls in China and Russia, it is good for US.
5. Lawmakers do not really care about 'illegal activity with Bitcoin". Illegal activities are already illegal. People do illegal activities with cash, that's not a reason to outlaw cash, right?

Claiming that you need a new architecture because Bitcoin can do only ~3 tps is a really flawed logic.
3 tps is a limitation of Bitcoin policy, not a limitation of Bitcoin software. (Actually it's closer to 8 tps if you do only simple single-input single-output transactions like you do.)
If you benchmarked bitcoind software, you would have noticed that it can process something on scale of 20000 tps on commodity desktop software.
This is not surprising. Basically, it just verifies tx signatures and writes data to LevelDB. LevelDB is pretty fast.
On 'big iron' hardware you'd get even more than 20k tps. I don't think it can reach 1M tps, but do you really have a case where you will do more than 20k tps?

Well, if your DB cannot tolerate a single node's failure, you have no security. It's not a tradeoff, it is a lack of security.
You have a trade-off in a situation when, say, one system can tolerate 1 of 10 nodes failing, and another can tolerate 2 nodes, but is slower/more complex. That's a trade-off.
If you do not anticipate Byzantine failures then just use RethinkDB.

I disagree. 
It is **extremely** hard, borderline impossible to review code running on your computer. (Note that even if you validated all source code, you also need to make sure that the compiler is clean.) And on top of that, you're going to run it on hardware which you haven't manufactured yourself, and can be bugged.
So you gotta to trust someone. And I think trusting Apple isn't worse than trusting open source devs -- Apple has a lot to lose if their OS compromised, they spend a lot of resources to secure it, and they have good track record so far. (E.g. adding end-to-end encryption to their messaging software, not caving to US government demands, etc.)
But if you're really paranoid, you shouldn't use modern computer/OS. You should run wallet software on an offline device. If you use a device which was manufactured before Bitcoin was created, chances that it's going to steal your wallet are slim. Even more so if it's physically unable to contact external world. (Although you might need to bring it data for signing which might compromise it.)

This is a ridiculous argument. 
First of all, it is a feature of a _payment system_, not a currency.
Second, we care about a number of _payments_ per second, not a number of transactions per second.
Bitcoin already supports practically unlimited number of payments per second as long as you manage to cram those payments into a relatively small number of transactions. And this can be done, e.g., through payment channels.
My opinion is that the block size should be increased only once we understand all the consequences. Meanwhile people should start using features which already exist in the Bitcoin protocol, we just need more intelligent wallets.

A lot of people see Bitcoin as a competitor to credit cards... but it is actually one of the least interesting and approachable use cases.
Sure, credit cards is something people use on a daily basis. But the thing is, they work pretty well, and so Bitcoin doesn't provide advantages significant enough to win here.
But there is a plenty of other contexts in which money is used. E.g. cross-border payments/remittance. The system which was developed by the banks is just horrible: it takes 3 days (or more), costs $25 per transaction, and is, in many ways, not convenient.
Other companies, e.g. PayPal, tried to improve on it, but it's still far from perfect. There is a lot of room for improvement.
Another thing is that a a lot of people have US-centric perspectives. Bitcoin's whole point is that it removes the need for trust.
Which means it's much less important when government and corporations you work with are more-or-less trustworthy. I know that US government and US corporations do a lot of shoddy things, but this is nothing compared to what 3rd world governments and corporations do.

Bitcoin works this way, though. There are many UASFs in Bitcoin history. Starting from Satoshi's fix for overflow, to 1 MB size limit, to BIP16 (P2SH).
All these things were introduced as UASF without any objective metric whatsoever.
And, of course, Satoshi didn't use any objective metric to release Bitcoin, he just released source code and people started using it. He didn't ask anybody about issuance schedule, supply, hash function, etc.
Thus Bitcoin itself is sort of an UASF within the infinite set of possible cryptocurrencies: it defined one choice of parameters, and people agreed to use that.

There are attacks which affect SPV wallets but do not affect full nodes.
But these attacks were **never** observed in practice. So Aaron was right: theoretically, there is risk, but practically, it's virtually non-existent.
OK well, maybe if you're receiving thousands of bitcoins it's a good idea to take additional precaution measures as you might be a target of unprecedented attack.
Now I gotta tell you one thing which they don't teach in a dogmatic troll school: **Bitcoin Core is actually vulnerable to a certain theoretically-feasible attack which makes it not better than SPV wallet from security standpoint.**
Core developers choose to ignore this vulnerability because it's too hard to fix it in a fully decentralized setting.
So the problem is that if node is isolated from honest nodes, it won't know the longest chain and will accept attacker's chain. Thus if an attacker can do two things:
1. isolate your Bitcoin Core from the rest of the network
2. create a chain of N valid blocks on top of the latest block your Bitcoin Core is aware of
he will be able to trick your Bitcoin Core wallet to accept double-spent funds with N confirmations.
Thus in practice Bitcoin Core is no better than SPV wallet, as isolating a node from the network is neither hard nor expensive. (The only difference is that a full node will require an attacker to actually have funds, while SPV wallet will allow him to pay with totally fake coins. But this difference is not significant.)
E.g. suppose you have a laptop with Bitcoin Core and connect to attacker's wifi. You're pwned. You use a public wifi? Might be pwned.
If you connect to a Bitcoin Core node which you have running at home... how do you know that your home network connection isn't pwned?
There is a simple way to protect yourself against this attack: you should additionally verify a payment against an external block explorer via SSL connection. It's extremely unlikely that an attacker will both hijack your connection _and_ hijack blockchain.info or a similar site.
But this protective measure also works with SPV wallets. So in practice they aren't much worse from security standpoint.

Human interactions aren't required when bitcoins are preloaded.
There are two separate questions:
1. Is it cheaper to buy bitcoins or to mine them on a tiny device?
2. How do we deliver bitcoins to the device?
So the second problem can be solved with simple hardware (you only need an unique keypair on the device) and a relatively simple software.
Thus it essentially boils down to question number 
But bitcoiners think that solving a problem with complex hardware is more "creative". But it's not creative, it's retarded. The actually creative solution is to use software for that, because software marginal costs are zero and it's infinitely flexible.

Yes. We first need a human consensus (over what code to run) before we can achieve a machine consensus over the longest chain.


Well, this is complex. We mostly care about the security of the system, i.e. invalid and fraudulent transactions should not be displayed as valid.
(I.e. if Alice claims that she paid to Bob and Bob's client shows transaction as valid, but it is not valid, Bob will send goods without receiving a proper payment, and will be very upset when he discovers it. This is what we want to prevent.)
Changes to Bitcoin protocols are called forks, as, at least conceptually, blockchain branches in two: the old one and the new one. Ideally, the old one should not physically exist, i.e. all clients will upgrade to a new protocol and will start building a chain according to new rules.
There are two ways to upgrade Bitcoin: soft fork and hard fork.
Soft forks are backward compatible in the sense that old clients see new blocks produced by new clients as valid. For a soft fork to be successful, it is enough for a majority of _miners_ to upgrade, as they will keep the new chain safe. (Note that by miners here and later I mean mining pools.)
Old miners will recognize blocks produced by new miners, but new miners might not recognize blocks produced by old miners. Thus old miners will be forced to upgrade, as otherwise they might lose their revenues.
If soft fork introduces a new kind of a transaction, old clients won't be able neither recognize, nor produce them. However, it is not a problem, as a new address format.
So let's say Alice gives Bob a new address... Bob's client doesn't recognize it. Thus Bob knows he needs to update his client.
If Bob gives Alice his old-client address, her client will either recognize it as old and tell her to tell Bob to upgrade. Or it will be backwards-compatible, and thus it will send coins to the old address, and Bob's client will recognize old-format transaction.
Hard fork is different... In simple terms, anybody who haven't upgraded is at risk of accepting invalid payments. (Also they might not see payments sent to them, but that depends.) However, I think they'll get a warning if they manage to connect to at least one honest node.
Bitcoin developers prefer soft forks and avoid hard forks at all costs, as they create much higher risk for Bitcoin users. I'm not sure if there was even a single one hard fork in Bitcoin's history.
A notable example of a soft fork is P2SH. It creates a new address format (starting with 3). Was done flawlessly, no users complained.

Well, they are right that it's risky. As for the scam, you can try convincing them by showing:
 * a large company accepting bitcoins
 * high-profile politicians discussing Bitcoin in a positive way
 * State of New York approved Bitcoin regulation called 'BitLicense'
 * regulated exchanges trading bitcoins
 * Bitcoin companies getting large investments
For example, Coinbase is a company which works only with Bitcoin and Ethereum. In its [C round]( it got $75M dollars from USAA (big US banks), BBVA (big global bank), NYSE (biggest exchange) and several reputable investment companies.
Obviously, big banks would never invest into something which they think is a scam, it would tarnish their reputation.

Same way P2SH was implemented: old clients and new clients will interpret scripts in different ways.
A common approach is to redefine the meaning of NOP: old clients still execute it as NOP, while new ones will execute a new instruction. This is how [BIP 65 OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY]( is implemented, for example: it redefines NOP2.
So if you want to integrate Ethereum scripting you can redefine one of NOPs to verify them. That is, a script will be of form `new_script_serialized_as_data OP_NEW_SCRIPT_VERIFY OP_DROP`. Old clients will interpret it as `data NOP DROP` which has no effect, while new clients will actually execute the script.

Usually it selects just enough inputs to pay for the thing you want to pay. Using more inputs will increase the size of the transaction, which also increases the fee, which is a bad thing.


It seems like it's a generally good way to do this:
1. It's inherently immune to replay attacks.
2. Wallet can do many payments in parallel.
3. Transaction can be done even with unconfirmed funds.
Account-based model makes wallet implementation simpler, but doesn't handle complex cases well. Additionally the output-based model which Satoshi have picked:
1. It's a simple measure to improve privacy.
2. Privacy-improving features can be built on top of it.
3. Multiple people can chip in and pay for one thing. (E.g. [assurance contract](
4. Various advanced features can be built on top of it, e.g. escrow, contracts, etc.

I think people are really underestimating the effect of the fork. Yep, combined market cap went up, so it looks OK, but we haven't seen the fallout yet.
The problem is that a fork undermines the whole concept of smart contracts.
Recall that Ethereum wasn't supposed to be a thin in itself like Bitcoin, it's supposed to be a fuel for smart contracts which have a connection to the external world. E.g. digital tokens, smart property, etc.
The whole point of using a blockchain is that it offers unambiguous state and transaction history everyone can observe.
If a blockchain is forked, then state is no longer unambiguous, thus a blockchain becomes completely pointless. Why bother paying transaction fees if it offers you NO guarantees whatsoever?
I work in a blockchain tech company consulting different companies from different industries on blockchain matters. I will now recommend against using smart contracts on public blockchains. We always knew that the problem is theoretically possible, but we thought that it's extremely unlikely. Well, after it have happened, it's no longer unlikely.
There are certain ways to deal with it, e.g. MakerDAO and Digix announced that their contracts are only valid on ETHF blockchain.
But it's a mess. You bring back human judgement and ambiguity. Note that both chains now claim that they are the real Ethereum. (Ethereum Classic is _the_ original blockchain, that's a fact.)
Traders are clueless. Ethereum have just demonstrated to the world that it's mostly useless experimental concept.
If Bitcoin forks like that in future, it will also be a problem. The whole point of Bitcoin is that there is only one chain backed by the majority of hashpower, which creates an immutable ledger, which makes tokens safe. If it ever forks in an ambiguous way, that will be a major problem. Even if the price will not go down the drain immediately, it will be a major problem, as it will be hard to explain people why Bitcoin is safe. People liken bitcoins to digital gold. But gold doesn't spontaneously split itself into several different metals, does it? So that metaphor -- as well as Bitcoin reputation -- goes down the drain.
So a fork of this kind is pretty much the worst thing which can happen to a cryptocurrency.

addnode is, by itself, insufficient to protect you against this attack.
1. It won't warn you that connection didn't happen. So you have to check if it is connected using getpeerinfo, for example.
2. You also do not know if you can actually receiving blocks from your buddy node, so you cannot just check it's there.
3. Connection is not encrypted, so attacker might impersonate your node.
4. Its identity is also not validated.
So in practice you can use this only if you set up a VPN and make a script which checks connections.
It might be easier/better to use public block explorer to check a payment. It might be even safer because you might not have a buddy who is 1) as reputable as blockchain.info, BitPay, etc; 2) is willing to set up a VPN with you.
I know that encrypted communication &amp; identity checks is in development, but can you just admit that Core devs aren't giving a proper attention to it?
There is a practically exploitable vuln, but few people know about it, and there are no docs explaining how to safeguard oneself. And we only start getting encrypted comm in 2016, 7 years in.
Segmentation is a different thing, BTW, it's not a targeted attack against one node.

Cryptocurrencies which are not based on PoW exist since 2013 (IIRC) and there haven't been any major problems of consensus, even though millions of dollars are at stake. So, empirically, an answer to this question is "yes".
Yes, maybe it's not as good as PoW in some sense. But it's definitely functional.
(Stellar had a glitch once. But so did Bitcoin. Nothing is perfect.)


No, it sounds like article's author didn't understand PBFT. You'll be better off reading PBFT academic paper, it's quite accessible.
PBFT relies on trusted nodes with known identities. It is secure under condition that no more than 1/3 of nodes will fail.


This depends on the context. Suppose there are 10 validator nodes, each of which is run by a bank.
Hijacking a major bank's servers is quite exceptional, hijacking 2 at the same time is even harder.
You'll need to hijack 4 to bring the network down.
In any case, it's more secure than a single bank's IT system.

Not down to zero, but the actual payable amount will be a tiny fraction of notional amount even in the worst case scenario.
This happens both because of hedging, i.e. an entity will typically own derivatives which cancel each other w.r.t. exposure.
And also because the actual payout is much smaller than the notional amount. E.g. suppose there is a derivative is connected to an interest paid on 1 million dollars of debt. Obviously, the biggest amount which mich be paid is much less than a million dollars, but the notional amount will be 1 million dollars.

Yes, it is possible, but it will only make things worse in most cases.
There is pretty much no room for a mistake when you pay using URI or QR code which is automatically-generated.
There are three kinds of errors we'd like to prevent:
1. Copy-paste error: a wrong address is copied or pasted.
2. Selection error: Bob selects 1Xyz in his wallet's address book because he believes it is Alice's address, but in fact it isn't.
3. Malware replaces addresses.
First two problems can be alleviated by using Bitcoin URIs instead of naked addresses, as URIs have labels. We don't need something as complex as a decentralized DNS, as we only need a hint to prevent accidental mistakes.
The third problem is complex. It might be addressed using a decentralized DNS kind of thing, but only if you assume that the sending user knows the exact name and will check the spelling. Otherwise, you'll need something more complex, like web-of-trust.
Finally, people who say that we need this kind of an address system assume the following workflow:
1. Alice tells Bob that he should pay her.
2. Bob looks up Alice's address in the system.
3. Bob pays to that address.
But there is an alternative work flow:
1. Alice sends Bob an invoice which includes her address.
2. Bob pays off that invoice.
which solves the same problem and doesn't need any additional systems. Alice just needs to know Bob's email or jabber address, the rest is handled by existing messaging systems.
So instead of creating a separate "Bitcoin DNS" we might just provide integration with messaging and encourage people to use invoiced/payment requests.

Basically Garzik thought that after SegWit activation we'll have two limits: size limit and weight limit, so he tried to change size limit.
But that doesn't make blocks bigger.
In reality, there is only one limit now: weight limit. 1 byte of normal transaction data has weight 4, so 4 MB weight limit restricts block size to 1 MB.
So initially Garzik's HF didn't really do anything, he fixed that last minute after it was pointed out by someone.

There are also indirect costs:
1. some users might be pissed-off if they find out that devices is mining bitcoins on their power bill, so fewer users will buy the device
2. a device is more likely to get damaged, so company has slightly higher number of returns
3. a device might be bricked if Bitcoin difficulty increases and amount of bitcoins it mines is no longer sufficient to perform useful functions

No, they don't. 
Suppose there are 10 miners having 10% of total hash power each.
Two blocks were likely mined by two miners. So two miners will lose 1 block each, 8 miners will lose nothing. So 80% of total hashpower has zero disincentives to join the fork. After they announce their intention, it would be rational for the remaining 2 miners to join the fork as well, as otherwise they are guaranteed to lose more.


Bitcoin mining is inherently risky. You buy equipment. You need to pay for electricity. Bitcoin price changes every day. Suppose you have 10% profit margin -- that is, 90% is spent on electricity and equipment. Bitcoin price can change 5% a day (sometimes even more). So it drops 5%, your profit is halved. In one day. Difficulty adjustment can be as big as 20%.
So mining is inherently a gamble. You already paid for equipment, you probably want to get ROI as soon as possible. Especially if your profit margins are very thin.


Eh, the security model should explain behavior in all cases, not just simple cases.

I already explained it: accounting rules apply to all companies, not just banks. Reserve requirements are specific to banks, but accounting isn't.


Loan isn't a liability, it is an asset.
Well, suppose bank issues its own BankCoin which isn't convertible to GovCoin. Guess what, nobody wants to take BankCoin loan because nobody will take these BankCoins, they are useless. You won't be able to buy a house with BankCoins.
OK, so suppose bank makes BankCoins convertible to GovCoins (and more often then not, loan-takers **will** convert them to GovCoins to be able to pay people who use other banks). So it needs to get GovCoins from somewhere... E.g. borrow them. So that's where liabilities come from.
Did you watch "Money as debt" video? Pretty much everybody who watched it got flawed understanding of how banks work.
Banks operate in the same way as normal businesses, they cannot get money out of nothing. They are different from normal companies in two ways:
 * they are subject to _additional_ regulations, such as reserve requirements
 * bank's debt is often called money. That is, instead of saying "bank owes me $1000" you say "I have $1000 in a bank".
People say that new money is created when bank makes a loan because it is how M1 money supply is calculated. It's not a phenomenon of itself, it's just how statistics is calculated.
Forget about banks. Suppose Bob borrows $100 from Alice and lends it to Claire. How much money is within the system? Depends on how you do the calculation. Only Claire has $100. So one answer is $100.
However, suppose Bob will report that Alice has $100 on account. That $100 will be summed to, so we get $200 together. So M0 money supply is $100 and M1 money supply is $200. Additional money was created by lending.
But wait, shouldn't M1 grow when Alice lends money to Bob? No, because money Bob holds on Alice's behalf doesn't count. That's just a useful way to calculating M1: depositing cash into a bank doesn't change M1.
Of course, individuals do not have to report how much they owe whom, but banks do, and this is why people say that banks create money: simply because they reveal how much people keep on bank accounts to the central bank, and central bank uses that to compute M1, which grows when bank lend money.
"Money as debt" present this basic fact to make it look like banks do something shoddy, but really they aren't.


How can it be funny money if it actually works? All the buildings, products etc. were financed and paid for using this "funny money", so it isn't really that funny if it is used to create wealth. It is backed by loans.
The problem with it is that it is inherently risky, and subjects unwitting people and taxpayers to risk they shouldn't be subject to. It is "risky money", not "funny money".

Simple Bitcoin payment UX (pay to an address) is simply not designed for point-of-sale payments.
BIP70 is better in this respect. It's not perfect, but at least it makes sure that 
 * the merchant is ready to accept a transaction
 * he will actually get a transaction
 * you will pay only once
So you should refuse to pay unless merchant uses BIP70.
**We need to make BIP70 the standard process to avoid shitty experience in future.**
This is important, people. If merchant doesn't use BIP70, tell him he's using old wallet which isn't designed for PoS use.
The solution exists, it's really a shame people keep using the way things worked 5 years ago when Bitcoin was in infancy.

Two of my posts on steemit got enough upvotes to get to its front page, which resulted in nice rewards. I was able to withdraw SBD portion of the reward, and a small fraction of SP portion too (via powering down).
So it works as advertised.
I was able to get upvotes without any connections to "inner circles" of Steem, just wrote posts and got upvoted.
Also it's worth noting that Steem white paper makes it clear that the model is based on redistribution of wealth. People who hold SP will be diluted at a rate of approximately 10% per year, so SP owners have to be involved in posting and voting just to keep their share. And this isn't a fine print, Dan (the tech guy behind STEEM) keeps reiterating this point in his articles.
So I find Ponzi accusations ridiculous. Nobody is promising high returns (which is the definition of Ponzi), in fact it is promised that people WILL be diluted.
So why would anyone buy STEEM? Well, this is actually quite complex and subtle. On surface one might think that it makes sense to buy STEEM if you believe that it's going to grow faster than than 10% per year (i.e. faster than the dilution).
But that is based on an assumption that growth makes STEEM valuable, which isn't an axiom. It really depends on what the "end game" is, i.e. if eventually everyone will be diluted to shit, then it won't be valuable in future, and thus won't be valuable now.
Obviously, there is no value in tokens which are used just for dilution. But there is value in eyeballs, as demonstrated by social media web sites like Facebook, reddit, etc. So people who buy STEEM assume that in future the platform will attract a lot of users (viewers, specifically), and Steem Power will be valuable because it will have influence over what these users will see.
We can do a crude estimation: the value of one of social media user is on the scale of $100, so the current Steem market cap of $350M implies that it should have at least 3.5M users. (In other words, it's now horribly over-valued, but perhaps investors think that it will jump to 3+M of active users soon enough.)
Also it's worth noting that Dan, the Steem's tech guy, says that SteemIt is just a project to bootstrap the economy, and real value of STEEM will come from the economy itself. (I.e. STEEM will be used for trade, smart contracts, etc.)
So for me it looks like Steem is not more of a Ponzi than Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. It seems like the article's writer just took a glance at the web site without looking deeper into it.
Also, comparison to Qntra is just hilarious. Qntra is basically a "Mircea Popescu fan club". Mircea is a guy who owns a fuckton of bitcoins, likes trading virtual shares and writes a blog (trilema.com). This have earned him a small but vocal fan base. Qntra, basically, hosts blogs of Mircea's fans, and Mircea (as well as other crazies) pay his minions through buying virtual shares of Qntra.

Makes sense.
My concern is that it is inherently bubbly: when BitShares price is growing, people will try to short other currencies and commodities to get more BitShares. But when if it collapses, it will collapse hard, because in addition to people naturally getting rid of BitShares, you'll have margin calls.
But it is more solid than NuBits, in my opinion: at least there is sound financial model (shorting, margin calls, etc) and can work automatically. While NuBits is a currency board... done by some anonymous people on the internet.
OK anyway, can you comment on the following scenario:
Let's for simplicity assume that there are only two markets: 1) BTS/USD where people trade between real USD and Bitshares; 2) BTS/bitUSD, which exists in Bitshares.
Suppose somebody who has a lot of bitshares dumps them on BTS/USD market, for any reason. (Maybe he is no longer interested in Bitshares, maybe he learned about some vulnerability, maybe he even does that just for shits and giggles.) Which significantly drops the price, let's say, 40%... or anything enough to trigger margin calls.
Now this price drop propagates to price feeds, and system automatically starts buying bitUSD for Bitshares which are held in escrow. Now people who previously held bitUSD are concerned about security of the system, so they will sell bitUSD for bitshares in order to sell them for real USD.
So the system will allow them to do that, i.e. bitshares which were held in escrow will go to people who wish to convert from bitUSD to real USD, and then those people will dump bitshares on BTS/USD market.
Which means we have a negative feedback loop over here. As price drops, more bitshares are released from the escrow and more bitshares are dumped on BTS/USD market, driving the price lower.
This might be exacerbated by people being aware of the negative feedback loop. If it happens, it is better to get out ASAP.

The main problem is that the market is basically non-existent.
Colored coins are mostly relevant to Bitcoin startups, or startups which are ready to embrace Bitcoin values. One of features which differentiates colored coins from centralized solutions is censorship resistance: normally, a user can send his colored coin to anybody at any time, without any consent of the company which issued it. This might be appealing to the cryptocurrency community, but it might be a bad thing for a startup, as it results in lower stickiness and potential regulatory problems.
Another major feature is integration with Bitcoin, i.e. it is possible to trade colored coins for bitcoins in a trustless manner. This feature is very interesting to the Bitcoin community, but few startups are ready to embrace free market.
Thus this market is essentially limited to cryptocurrency startups, and very few companies which are willing to experiment with blockchain tech and aren't afraid of legal repercussions.
But cryptocurrency startups have a variety of technologies to choose from: Counterparty, Omni, NXT, Ethereum, Bitshares and so on. Some of them have rather compelling features, for example, BitShares offers 3 second confirmation time. Thus colored coins proper get very little attention, and pretty much nobody is willing to pay for development.
Those companies which attract significant VC investment typically implement their own shit instead of working on common standard. You know, investors do not give them money to develop standards.
As for established companies like banks and financial institutions, they are not interested in colored coins:
 * censorship-resistance is a drawback rather than a feature (they want to be able to block accounts and transactions)
 * ability to send a colored coin to anyone is a regulatory problem
 * 10+ minutes confirmation time (which is unpredictable) is a big issues for many uses
 * Bitcoin fees are rather high
 * Bitcoin throughput is too small, big companies usually have millions of users
 * these companies are not interested in Bitcoin integration
Moreover, banks do not like Bitcoin. Regulatory uncertainty, anonymous miners, all that stuff. So, basically, colored coin offer none of features they might be interested in, and a lot of disadvantages.
One might try to find a workaround to some of the problems above, e.g. controlling transactions using multi-sig. But then the system becomes too centralized, so what's the point?
Now about development, many people/startups tried to develop a colored coin platform, but pretty much all of them switched to something else after they were unable to find a significant market:
 * Flavien Charlon/CoinPrism. OpenAssets. Got significant traction in the bitcoin community (although OpenAssets suck ass, in my opinion), but was unable to monetize it/find significant market. Now it looks like they switched to something else: OpenChain, a custom anchored blockchain.
 * Gideon Greenspan/CoinSpark. They now work on MultiChain, a private blockchain technology based on Bitcoin Core/colored coins.
 * Colu. They got a lot of money, I think on the scale of $10M, and developed a colored coins platform. But they were unable to find significant customers in that sphere and switched to private blockchains for "community coins", as far as I know.
 * ChromaWay. EPOBC. That's me. So far we found two customers who are now running colored coin based stuff in production, with real money. But it's a tiny market. So we are shifting our focus to something else.
We (ChromaWay) aren't shutting down colored coin development completely, but we cannot focus on it completely as there are few chances to find more paying customers.
Also I think there are people who keep working on OpenAssets stuff, for example, Nicolas Dorier.
What's about adding colored coins to the Bitcoin protocol proper?
Core developers are 100% uninterested. Most Core developers are Blockstream people, and they propose to use sidechains instead of colored coins. They already added native user-defined asset support to Elements project.
MAYBE one day it will be somehow ported to the Bitcoin blockchain proper, but I'm not holding my breath.
So the situation with development is sad, but even if we had native support right in the Bitcoin protocol and all the tooling, I don't think we'd have a lot more users.
I think situation might change in 5-10 years if integration with Bitcoin will be a must-have feature.

I don't think you understood what I described. Forget colored coins, it is about a conditional commitment.
Suppose there are two exchanges. 
Exchange A commits to a statement "1000 euro will be transferred from Alice to Bob if transaction X is confirmed".
Exchange B commits to a statement "1100 dollars will be transferred from Claire to Dave if transaction X is confirmed".
A Bitcoin transaction is used both for synchronization between exchanges (Byzantine Generals problem) and for moving of value (bitcoins).
So three transfers will happen at the same time, this is why exchange rate is fixed. And there is no risk that, say, exchange A will do the transfer, but exchange B won't. Or that the Bitcoin transfer will be double-spent after exchange A moves the funds. 
As for colored coins, it is one of ways to encode the commitment, but not the only one. A more space-efficient way would be to create a message and commit to it via a hash included into a transaction.
Note that we assume that exchanges do not trust each other, thus moving IOUs around (whether on centralized or decentralized ledger) is not an option, we need to move value in form of bitcoins.

Well, it's true that a troll chain with only 0.01% hashpower is easy to weed out. No reasonable person will consider it to be real. 
But in a case like ETH/ETC it is very hard to decide.
E.g. if you define that the chain of valid blocks (according to a certain definition of valid) and biggest total work is the real one, then you're ruling in favor of Ethereum Classic, i.e. this definition cannot handle hard forks.
Also this definition rules in favor of a 51% attacker. E.g. if somebody can amass a large hashpower he can do a double-spend and rewrite history, and the definition will rule in his favor.
So this is anything but simple. You can certainly say that it's up to Ethereum Foundation to decide which one is real, but then EF is a trusted third party.


The alternative is to use private/federated blockchains, which make things much simpler. If one wants to deal with a cryptocurrency he can use a federated sidechain.

BTW, it looks like people here assume that Craig Wright was "defeated" when he was unable to provide valid evidence and skeptical articles started to appear in press.

There is no reason to think that he's going to stop doing these private demonstrations. So he can keep defrauding people.
He might say that he failed a public demonstration on purpose, to prove that he's not Satoshi. This proof might be necessary e.g. to get extortionists off his tail.
But now he can demonstrate that Gavin et al. were convinced with his demonstration and his story. So his scam might look quite plausible.

It is possible, but doesn't make sense IMHO.
The big problem with Lightning network is that it requires intermediate nodes to hold large amount of collateral to facilitate trades. The amount of collateral must be enough to cover trade volume over the certain time period.
So, suppose you want to facilitate significant amount of trade volume, e.g. a hundred of million dollars. That's not a huge volume: if a million users will do $100 purchase each, you have $100M total volume. Let's consider two cases:
1. Intermediate nodes are provided by the issuer. I.e. he will issue $100M worth of colored coins to give to the users plus $100M worth of coins to be held by his own intermediary nodes. This set up makes no sense at all, as it is 100% centralized (all transactions are facilitated by the issuer) but is incredibly complex and creates a huge risk to the issuer.
2. 3rd party intermediary nodes. In this case somebody needs to come up with $100M of capital to buy colored coins from the issuer, and then these $100M will be put under risk as it will be held in a hot wallet. So basically this is very unrealistic.
Thus I don't think that Lightning network makes sense. Maybe it can be used for micropayments (trade volume is small so large capital requirements are irrelevant). Maybe it works better with native cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (plenty of people are willing to provide capital for intermediary nodes).
I believe that private chains/sidechains are the best option. A sidechain can be (co-)maintained by an issuer, so transactions can be arbitrarily cheap. At the same time users get full transparency and good security. (E.g. a sidechain can be anchored, which makes it as secure as Bitcoin.)
At the same time inter-issuer settlements can happen on the main Bitcoin blockchain, also it can be used to handle migrations and whatnot.

With all due respect, I think Yours will be DOA.
1. STEEM doesn't require one to spend money to upvote.
2. STEEM is able to pay rewards using newly minted money. (It is redistributionary, but this is hidden by growing popularity.)
What attracts people to STEEM are relatively big rewards. People see that one can earn like $1000 per post.
Yours won't be able to do that unless somebody is going to put his own 100000 BTC to subsidize rewards. You will see rewards on scale of $0.1, not $1000.

The important question here is how much of Bitcoin's security depends on "reputation of miners".
Typically when people describe the Bitcoin model they assume anonymous rational miners.
It seems like many bitcoiners want to have a cake and eat it too. They justify PoW saying how it enables anonymous miners to hide from government persecution, "don't trust, verify", etc. But when it comes to game theories, they talk about miner reputation, benevolent honest miners thinking about their long-term prospects and so on.
This seems like intellectual dishonesty to me.
And when you add the talk about Bitcoin being the future, hyperbitcoininzation and so on, this goes to moral bankruptcy. It basically translates to "We don't know how it works, but you should totally buy it, it's the future!". Sounds like a scam to me.

I'm not talking about a person buying them. I'm talking about company providing them as needed.
Suppose some device happens to need bitcoins. These bitcoins can be provided in one of two ways:
1. a company called 21.co can add a mining chip
2. a company called 12.co will buy bitcoins on the market and provide them to devices as needed
So if a company like ASUS needs to bitcoins on its home routers, it might choose whether to go for 21.co service or 12.co service. In either case it will cost them, say, $1 per router.
So exact implementation details are abstracted out, in the end it is about trade-offs. In either case and user doesn't need to know anything about bitcoins, it is all abstracted for him.


I don't think you understand what their product is. Do you understand that mining chips do not create bitcoins? 21.co mining pool creates them. Without the pool chips are 100% useless. They are also useless without micropayment service 21.co provides.
So 21.co is really a **service** company, not a hardware company. They make it possible for a device to do Bitcoin payments on their network, that's the service they provide.
However, instead of just taking money for that service, they require hw vendors to use 21.co chip design. So it's a complex arrangement where hw vendor agrees to do something for 21.co, and 21.co agrees to do something for hw vendor.

(Most people do not care about Bitcoin because they don't really have any money.)


It definitely does: one who has a lot of SP can promote content. There is no clear distinction betweens ads and content.

OK, suppose I want to build Bitcoin-based file sharing app. The idea is to embed data into Bitcoin transactions. Then anybody can get this data by requesting Bitcoin blocks. Data is replicated to all Bitcoin nodes, so there is, like, a free CDN with ~5000 nodes, which means there is a plenty of bandwidth available for free. You pay just once for inclusion into a block and get unlimited downloads after that.
Do you want this kind of applications on Bitcoin blockchain? Nodes will be happy to store gigabytes of data on their disks and serve it to millions of users, right? (Don't forget that miners are paid once for inclusion of data into the blockchain -- and then nodes are supposed to keep and serve it forever, for free.)
Or maybe, just maybe, we keep Bitcoin for censorship-resistant transactions, and recommend people to use a more appropriate platform -- e.g. BitTorrent -- for file sharing. Crazy thought, I know.

In my opinion, if fees approach $100, factors such as "centralization pressure" become less important. Some abstract threats which are only relevant in future are less relevant than the fact that system is already unusable by most people.

Wrong. The main advantage of a blockchain in this situation is _transparency_. Every change will be visible to everyone, so fraud and abuse can be detected.
You might say that it's also possible with a centralized database: if it is correctly designed there will be multiple copies maintained by independent entities, records can be hashes together and compared... wait, doesn't it sound a bit like a blockchain?
There is a project called [Certificate Transparency]( it's not a blockchain, but it relies on "certificate logs", which are:
 * append-only--certificates can only be added to a log; certificates can’t be deleted, modified, or retroactively inserted into a log. 
 * cryptographically assured--logs use a special cryptographic mechanism known as Merkle Tree Hashes to prevent tampering and misbehavior.
 * publicly auditable--anyone can query a log and verify that it’s well behaved, or verify that an SSL certificate has been legitimately appended to the log

Well again, I'm talking about things like user-defined assets, smart contracts and smart property. These are things which Ethereum was designed to deal with.
For example, [Tether tokens]( represent US dollars on Bitcoin blockchain.
Now suppose Bitcoin somehow forks into Bitcoin Modern and Bitcoin Classic. What will happens with tokens? Which of them are valid?
Ethereum's big promise was that blockchain smart contracts will control real-world property, e.g. you will be able to sell your house using a smart contract, in a cheap/awesome/trustless way.
But this goes down the drain if it's possible that Alice will own the house on one chain, and Bob will own it on the other one. Basically, the forking disaster demonstrates that Ethereum is unfit to serve one of its main promises.

Yes. 
You're confusing nominal value and real value.
E.g. suppose at some point we have 100M Steem total supply, at a price of $1 per STEEM  market cap is $100M.
A year later total supply will be increased to 200M Steem. However, if this is just redistribution rather than real growth, market cap (i.e. value of all Steem) will stay the same, so the price of 1 STEEM will be $0.5 USD.
Now suppose that someone initially owned 10 STEEM worth of SteemPower. 90% of newly created STEEM goes to SP owners, thus after a year he will own 19 with of STEEM power.
So he have earned **nominal** interest denominated in STEEM. However, the real value of his holdings have decreased: he now has `19*0.5 = 9.5` USD instead of 10 USD he owned initially. 0.5 USD went into various rewards.
Total share of STEEM owned by that person have also decreased: `10/100M &gt; 19/200M`.
So again, Steem is redistribution-based by design. Rewards cannot be created from somewhere, they are created through dilution, which reduces the value of holdings of existing Steem and SteemPower holders.
However, the real value of one's Steem/SteemPower can grow if the market cap (i.e. the size of steem economy) grows. But one can earn profits only if the market cap growth faster than he is diluted. SP is diluted much slower than STEEM so people who expect long-term growth should hold SP.

There reason why blockchain is considered relevant in this case is explained here: 
Yes, in theory, you can have a centralized administrator who will _both_ manage a registry and enforce it.
But in practice it kinda sucks because a centralized administrator might abuse his power. That's why you might want separation of duties.
A blockchain can help to keep track of property rights, while enforcement is done by law enforcement people.

Yes. The assumption here is that it's highly unlikely that an attacker can segment both you and several high-profile targets like blockchain.info and BitPay.
That possibility cannot be eliminated completely, but we need to be reasonable.
So under reasonable assumptions, using an SPV node is about secure as using a full node for validating transactions, under condition that you check multiple external semi-trusted sources (which, we assume, run full nodes themselves). This is my point.
I'm not saying we should replace all full nodes with SPV nodes, we are talking about personal wallet security here. High-profile targets such as exchanges shouldn't rely on SPV wallets either.

Putting a hash of the document into the blockchain is known as proof-of-existence. It can only prove that a document have existed before a certain point of time, but it _does not_ prove that there are no conflicting versions of document.
Thus, by itself, proof-of-existence adds little value. It can prevent back-dating of documents, but it cannot prevent a deliberate "double-spend" attack. It needs to be more sophisticated if you also want to prevent more kinds of attacks.
The point of the Land Registry tech demo wasn't to timestamp documents, but to model a process of buying a house. This process involves many parties, we use a blockchain to give them an unambiguous view of the current state, also creating an immutable audit trail along the way.
We do this with our Ratatosk platform, which allows different mechanisms to be used for consensus. 
Originally consensus was supposed to be implemented using colored coins on the Bitcoin blockchain. This involves storing message hashes in the Bitcoin blockchain, just as you described, but additionally transactions must be linked together to form a single unambiguous chain. This guarantees that there is only one version of history.
However, posting every message as an individual Bitcoin transaction is rather inefficient: it costs money, spams the blockchain, provides slow confirmations.
Also for the next step we might want more complex logic which would require a custom blockchain.
But anyway, whether a document is timestamped directly or indirectly doesn't change anything in terms of immutability: it's timestamped anyway as long as you put some hash into the Bitcoin blockchain. Direct timestamping is actually easier to implement, but it's also less efficient and might not satisfy all requirements. (i.e. timestamping a document in a context of a chain of messages provides more solid evidence).

I can't say it's a "killer feature", but it might make sense in some cases.
For example, it can function as a pension fund of sorts: the longer you live, the more money you need. When somebody dies, his relatives will withdraw the money, and the fee on withdrawal funds annuities of those who are still alive.
So it is sort of a [longevity insurance]( Perhaps not unlike [tontine]( but only a fraction of the sum is redistributed.
Perhaps you can make it more like tontine by changing parameters: allow slow withdraw without a fee, but withdrawing a lump sum has high fee.
There are other possible uses. If you use it with different tokens, you can encourage people to get them as early as possible. This can be used for a trustless, oracle-less prediction market (different tokens represent different outcomes). [See here](
(And while we are here, the recent Ethereum ICO Bancor uses very similar mechanism to make backed tokens. But I don't like that, tbh...)


It's not a bad thing. Just locking money has macroeconomic effect (you're delaying consumption), it's not meaningless.


None of that is risk-less, or even trustless.


Nothing happened to them... There were several competing implementations, I guess that prevented colored coins to be established as the best way to issue tokens. (Besides that Counterparty and Mastercoin also allowed issuing tokens, which further diluted the mindshare.) Companies which worked on colored coins then switched to do enterprise blockchain stuff.
Colu / coloredcoins.org still offer colored coins, I think, but their reputation is pretty bad since they are more startup-y than open-source-y.
At ChromaWay, we stopped marketing colored coins a while ago. You know, Bitcoin fees are not good, nobody would want that. So, perhaps, it's good that people haven't started using Bitcoin for tokens. (And, BTW, my research shows that LN makes no sense for colored coins: you'll be better off with a private blockchain.)
Perhaps one of factors in the lack of colored coins popularity is that I didn't want to make software for scammy tokens, so ChromaWallet was never announced as finished, instead of making a DIY ICO kit we spend efforts to find legitimate issuers.


Ethereum community is more into investing into tokens since presumably the whole point of Ethereum is to build the dapps ecosystem. So there's much more capital available.

The requirements to be considered a bitcoin sidechain are incredibly low. As the Blockstream paper defined it, it can be any blockchain which has something to do with another blockchain.
Implement a 2-way peg using a bunch of pre-defined custodians is enough to claim you have a "bitcoin sidechain". This is exactly what Blockstream does in Liquid.
So, potentially you can team up with your buddies and make a multi-sig wallet, add a bit of automation, and -- bam -- you have a "bitcoin sidechain". Nice, isn't it?
The papers on RSK web site are quite vague, they are like "we could do this, or maybe we could do that...". But apparently they use merged mining for consensus. (Which IMHO is a bad idea, but OK.)
So if we remove marketing lingo, what RSK is doing is basically equivalent to Namecoin (which is also merge-mined, by Bitcoin miners) with 2-way custodial peg. If Namecoin had smart contracts, would you say everything on Namecoin is Bitcoin-powered?
Note that true decentralized sidechains which were touted by Blockstream back in 2014 do exist and might never exist. Dipshits from Blockstream pulled a bait-and-switch on us: they made everyone excited about decentralized sidechains, then wrote a paper so vague that pretty much anything can be a sidechain, and finally released a "sidechain" with federated peg (basically, just multi-sig with some automation). So people who do not look into details believe it's super awesome.

There is already like a dozen of project which can do user-defined assets, both based on Bitcoin blockchain (colored coins, Omni, Counterparty) and using a custom blockchain (Ripple, Stellar, Nxt, BitShares).
Moreover, these project actually already have some assets, e.g. Omni has Tether USD.
BitShares has a USD smartcoin which is backed by BitShares held in escrow, so it has no counterparty risk in a traditional sense. If also has OPEN.USD which is a token issued and backed by a particular exchange called OpenLedger.
So it's not clear why it was necessary to raise millions in funding to do something which people did 3+ years ago.
WAVES claim they improve scalability and bring in some extra features, but WAVES platform is actually based on an open source project developed by other company (Scorex, by IOHK). IOHK claims it is just a research project with no particular focus on scalability.

We need the blockchain, but we don't need to push every payment into the blockchain as an individual transaction.
One trivial example is that you can make a single transaction with 10 outputs instead of 10 individual transactions. It will be 9x smaller, as it requires only 1 digital signature instead of 10.
Another example is a group of 10 people sitting in a restaurant: they can produce a single transaction paying off entire bill instead of making 10 individual transactions.
In both these examples, the structure of payments is relevant to parties involved (merchant needs to know that Bob have paid off his order), but not to other parties.
The blockchain is still very useful for synchronizing things at large, but it is not necessary for synchronizing each small detail (e.g. supplier only cares that he was paid with real coins, but he doesn't care if they came from Bob or from somebody else).
Pushing each payment as an individual transaction is very wasteful, as this transaction needs to be processed by every node, now and in future.
Also note that bigger number of transactions per second means that more and more users will opt to trust miners (SPV) or centralized services.

Yeah, fuck Western Union which reliably and conveniently transfers money and is upfront about fees.
People should totally switch to a currency which can drop in value 15% a day, has unpredictable fees and requires conversion (which charges more fees) on both ends! Oh, also you can lose your keys or get scammed unless you're a security expert.
I've been a bitcoiner for 7 years. For a long time I thought we need to stay positive and wait for things to improve. Fake it till you make it, you know. But over these 7 years, I see no improvements. And yet I see a lot of people who are sure that Bitcoin is a solution for every problem and every non-problem.
So I become increasingly convinced that Bitcoin is a scam. Sort of an emergent, decentralized scam.
By all means, Bitcoin can be useful in some situations. But people are over-selling its benefits.

This isn't going to happen as long as bitcoins are held by the actual human beings who have needs.
Bitcoins being "hodled" are essentially savings. People aren't saving just for it's own sake, savings are supposed to be used in emergency situations, for large purchases, kids education, retirement, etc.
I don't think you're really helping the economy when you make an unnecessary purchase. It can certainly increase someone's revenue in the short term, but it also means that you will have less buying power in future.

Are you talking about money supply? MB or M1?
The dollar is designed in such a way that MB has no direct effect on prices.
It is also designed to be stable. In the last 10 years it was losing no more than 5% of its value per year. Compare that to Bitcoin which can easily lose 15% of its value in _a day_.
This is very useful for business -- obviously, it would be very hard to do any trade if price can change 10% per day. 
So dollar is useful for trade (like a shipment of goods within weeks or months), but not useful for multi-year savings, as it continuously losing value. So just don't use it for savings, ok?
Many people criticize fiat money without understanding what it is and how it works, and what it is designed to do.

I've looked at NXT source code when it was first released. Was not impressed.
First of all, its PoS might as well be called Piece-of-Shit, it's horribly broken. It wasn't cracked only because almost all coins were held by early adopters.
And in general it looks like it was written by some mediocre Java programmers.
Ethereum is much more advanced, and has way more research &amp; development (and really talented devs) behind it.
Also, NXT had an extremely shoddy start, not because of scams, but because initially all NXT was owned by the creator and then sold privately to some "early adopters". This is absolutely unacceptable for a PoS coin, in my opinion.
To be fair, NXT is much more advanced than Bitcoin copycats like Dogecoin, etc. Still, it's not Ethereum.
Coins like NXT and BitShares might be work horses which are usable right now, but Ethereum has a huge potential for the future. At least, that's how it's marketed. So you see why "vocal Bitcoin personalities bought into the ETH crowdsale". They wanted to invest into something which might be an ultimate answer, not just a next step of an evolution.

People who believe it will keep growing won't power down, as keeping SP is the best way to preserve one's steem. Other, more cautious people might power down ASAP.
But, obviously, people who have significant amount of SP believe that it will keep growing.
So I think most people will start to power down only once the growth will stagnate and they will see the effect of dilution. So more likely it will take 4 years rather than 2.

The problem with LN is that money has to be locked in channels.
Commercial channel providers will need FUCKTON of money to avoid making on-chain transactions.
Person-to-person links will offer very poor connectivity.
Consider an example: Alice wants to pay 1 Bitcoin to Bob. If they are directly connected with a payment channel that can be done essentially for free. But since there are millions of Bitcoin users, it's very unlikely that two particular users are connected.
But suppose that it happens that there is a channel between Alice and Claire and a channel between Claire and Bob. They could use that to avoid on-chain transactions:
 * Alice --1 BTC--&gt; Claire --1 BTC--&gt; Bob
Now the problem is that Claire now has 1 BTC locked in channel with Bob. She can't use that money. If she doesn't want to make on-chain transactions, then she needs to wait until Bob pays Alice. It might take a while.
Thus to use lightning efficiently you need a ton of spare money in channels.

Well, in our case, Da Vinci not only described a helicopter, but have actually built it, launched it, and it have been flying smoothly for over 7 years.
Then many other types of helicopters have been launched (alt-coins).
It's also worth noting that 7 years is A LOT of time in tech.
Sure, there is a lot of bad investments in blockchain tech companies, but that's not specific to blockchain tech. Many investments just happen to be bad. Just look at Theranos: it got $400M in funding and has, basically, nothing to show.
What people are generally missing about blockchain tech is that in most cases it will only bring small, incremental improvements. But those small improvements are necessary as a stepping stone for the further progress.
For example, proof-of-existence prevents back-dating. It's the only kind of an attack it prevents, so it cannot solve all security issues. But still, a system which uses proof-of-existence is slightly more secure than a system without it. Bitcoin-based proof-of-existence can already be used now (there is a plenty of APIs which do that), but, obviously, investing into "proof-of-existence tech" makes little sense. Not because proof-of-existence is not yet understood, but because it is simple, well-understood and, by itself, isn't really worth anything.
I mean you might be able to earn thousands of dollars by offering some sort of an easy-to-use proof-of-existence service, but I don't think you can make billions on that, and billions is what VCs have in mind.

It's quite likely Satoshi went to college himself:
 * The Bitcoin paper is written in academic style. It is very unusual for software developed outside of academic contexts to have a "paper". Normally docs are in different formats, e.g. HTML, and more free-form. E.g. [BitTorrent protocol specification]( RFCs, etc. Alt-coiners usually try to emulate Satoshi, but most of their whitepapers are very poorly written.
 * Satoshi's C++ style is consistent with a theory that he learned programming in college: it's generally well-written, but uses a dated style (probably popular at time Satoshi learned it, also colleges often use dated textbooks), also misses certain thing which a professional programmer would consider important, particularly, modularity.
Lack of proper separation into modules is considered a mortal sin among pros: people who work on large code bases know that when you have everything mixed together it is very hard to maintain stuff. So they typically _start_ with defining different modules and relationships between them. On the other hand, software people do in college typically does one task and it's fairly small, so it's typically developed as one monolithic thing.
Satoshi noted the importance of maintaining consensus code intact, but never bothered to separate consensus code from GUI and networking. He probably wasn't comfortable with separating software into libraries. In college, they usually teach you language syntax and algorithms, but not about tooling used for more complex software.

I'd like to see at least some remotely-plausible model. If it turns out wildly incorrect, that's OK. But if our brightest minds cannot find a plausible scenario where it could work, that would be a worrying sign.
When I was working on Cuber mobile wallet (colored coins), we analyzed whether something like LN would help to reduce transaction costs. But there is a very basic math: if we want to avoid making on-chain payments for a month (assuming that users refill their wallets each month or so), we need to supply one month worth of trade volume in capital to LN hub. Which is fucking a lot. E.g. 100k users spending $200 a month on average will be $20M. (Of course, it just makes no sense to do it for user-defined assets, but that's another story...)

1. Many merchant accept payments with zero confirmations, i.e. they trust users to some extent. Double-spending requires using special 'hacked' wallets which aren't readily available to ordinary consumers.
2. Zero confirmations are also logical when merchant can cancel the purchase once he discovers double-spend. For example, an online game might freeze user's account.
3. There are wallets which enable secure instant payments, for example, BitGo Instant and GreenAddress. They do that using multi-sig (co-signing transactions).
4. Low-value purchases like powerups might be better done using payment channels: in that case confirmations are instant and you don't need to pay a fee.
tl; dr: Bitcoin as a currency supports many different payment scenarios, but it will take time for merchants/users to switch to wallets which are best for their use.

Innovation is orthogonal to decentralization.
Ethereum "smart contract" model decouples consensus from protocol logic, it allows you to implement arbitrary blockchain logic while reusing existing consensus mechanism. If you don't see how this is useful and interesting you either lack imagination or understanding.
Here's one example: [there is]( an academic paper describing "Bitcoin Covenant" mechanism which might improve wallet security.
When implemented on top of Bitcoin, this mechanism is very complex (both to understand and to implement), and there is essentially 0% probability it will be added to Bitcoin in near future.
The same concept can be implemented in like 15 lines of Solidity code. In Ethereum, it's trivial and can be implemented today, in an hour or so, not in 10 years. I'll remind you we are talking about wallet security improvements, which are quite useful. 
So the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is absolutely staggering, we are talking about 2-3 orders of magnitude of difference in terms of complexity.
You might disagree with Ethereum leadership on some points, but this doesn't nullify their technical accomplishments. If you like Sergio more than Vitalik, feel free to use RSK instead, but it's the very same tech.
You might say that Ethereum simply pushes complexity from client apps to the core, but it's not quite true. The core of Ethereum is actually about as simple as Bitcoin, you can see it [here]( On top of this, Ethereum wallet is an order of magnitude easier to implement a Bitcoin wallet (I know because I implemented several Bitcoin wallets).
Bidirectional payment channels ("Lightning Network") is much easier on top of Ethereum too: instead of complex tree of transactions you only need a serial. E.g. if Alice cheats by posting a superseded transaction, Bob can override that by posting a transaction with higher serial during the contest period. A basic bidirectional payment channel can be implemented within one day, it doesn't require years of engineering by top minds, which is the case with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:34:35
Depends how you define "the core value proposition".
Bitcoin's growing pains are connected to the simple PoW protocol it uses and very conservative attitude of Core developers.
There are many proposals to alleviate centralization pressure linked to block size.
PoS and PoW/PoS hybrid are also much less sensitive to block size.
PoS also makes SPV more secure (well, that depends on particular protocol and how you define security), and make sharding possible.
Also native support for bidirectional payment channels could make Lightning-like protocols much more efficient as you can implement multi-party channels without being restricted by Bitcoin Script which was not designed for this.
All in all, Bitcoin is very far from the state of the art. We don't even have committed UTXO set, while Ethereum have been using it for 2 years. (And, I think, Ripple had it for 4 years.)
The thing is, changes require trade-offs. It won't be exactly same as before. It will be better in one way and worse in another way.
Bitcoin protocol gets very little development because people are unwilling to reconsider the trade-offs. People just assume that the way it works now is the best and changing anything is a bad idea.
It was demonstrated many times (e.g. in peer-reviewed academic papers) that Bitcoin protocol has many issues w.r.t. incentives and so on. And in practice we see that production of mining devices is dominated by one company, which is extremely unhealthy and worrisome.

Microsoft didn't know absolutely anything about security till mid 2000s, they thought that all ISVs are reputable and will never want to harm a user... Also they ignored virus threats even though viruses were known as a real threat for decades.
How dumb do you need to be to execute code from a USB drive user have just inserted without even asking any questions?
Some time after XP release Microsoft noticed all the gaping holes they have created, and started patching them... Slowly... But it was too late.
Real security measures were implemented in Vista and Win7, but again, they used same general model, it is hard to add security as an afterthought.
On the other hand, smartphones were designed to be secure from ground up.
For example, Symbian 9 was released around 2005, it was a really locked down OS... It was fundamentally impossible for one program to read files created by another program, and on top of that all programs needed to be signed.
I'll remind you it was before Microsoft released Vista, when mainstream PC OS was Windows XP, full of gaping holes.
Yea, PC security has decades of experience, but the only experience we got is that PC security is shitty as fuck.
It is same as to say that you trust Windows more because you know how remove Windows viruses, but you don't trust Linux because you don't have such experience. Well, no shit, nobody has such experience because viruses are pretty much non-existent on Linux.
I'll tell you what: if your OS requires anti-virus scanner, its security is broken by design. Why? Virus scanners can block only known threats, but they cannot block new ones (at least, not reliably), and you're constantly exposed to new threats, so reliance on anti-virus scanner is always a gamble.

scrypt which is used by Litecoin was designed by ArtForz for cryptocurrency Tenebrix. (Which died because too few people understood the rationale behind it. That's a pity.)
The idea was that people would be able to mine Tenebrix on CPU _while_ they mine bitcoins on GPU. He wanted Tenebrix mining to have as little overhead as possible (so that it is possible to use box for other uses alongside Tenebrix mining), so he made it so scrypt uses only 128 (or 64?) KiB, and thus fits in CPU's cache.
ArtForz is also a person who created the first GPU Bitcoin miner. So, being a competent GPU programmer, he thought it is impossible to make fast GPU miner.
He was wrong. People found a trick to do it.
So, Litecoin just copied this scrypt parameters...

Likewise, if you're a business. Most businesses have profit margins which do not exceed 10%. So you negotiate a deal, set price in BTC. Boom, next day you are 5% underwater. Nice, isn't it?
So, yeah, Bitcoin is good when you HODL, or you're trader, investor, whatever.

No, that's not how it works. When you have 51% of hashing power you _can_ start building only on top of your own blocks. Statistically, your chain will be the longest one, so you can ignore blocks produced by others.


The problem is that other miners don't have an incentive to mine anymore.
Also, you can buy more ASIC miners with Bitcoins you've just mined...


No, 51% is enough for blockade, see above. This is why people talk about 51% attack, not about 100% attack.

In the most likely topology payments will be typically done through hubs. E.g. `User -&gt; Hub -&gt; Merchant`. To make use of Lightning efficiency, hub needs enough money to cover payments.
E.g. suppose there is a brand new hub which serves a number of merchants, users made channels with hub and started purchasing goods.
If you don't want to do on-chain transaction (which is the whole point), the the hub needs enough capital to cover all payments. So e.g. if users bought 1000 BTC worth of goods, hub needs to hold 1000 BTC in open channels with merchants.

AFAIK it was Mike who wrote  [this]( I.e. he thought that Bitcoin could scale to VISA-like throughput (2000 tx/s, 500 MB blocks) without any changes to the architecture.
When I tried describing various divide-and-conquer strategies (like sidechains) back in 2011, he just wrote that there are no needs for architectural improvements as we can just make blocks bigger.
He also assumed that the majority of miners will be honest (rather than just rational), so he probably saw no problems with centralization pressure, etc.
So I won't be surprised if he assume that high-end nodes will simply hold entire blockchain in memory, and use terabyte/s memory bandwidth to scan it quickly. At the Google scale (Mike was working at Google at that time) it is a non-issue.

Fractional reserve banking doesn't have the problem that airline overbooking has: money is digital, not physical; the central bank exists specifically to address this issue: in case of a bank run, the central bank will simply create more money.
They simply cannot run out of money as they define what it is.

There are several software projects in various states of incompleteness. Which one is easiest to complete depends on what kinds of developers will join. It also will affect feature schedule.
E.g. if nobody will join, I will continue writing a command-line client in Python with absolutely minimal set of feature. If we'll get some godlike Python dev, we can make a nicer client.
Also I'm looking for people who can make decisions on their own and understand Bitcoin protocol and related crypto, at least on basic level. If I'll have to make each decision, it won't really speed up development...
So, projects. I manage "BitcoinX" branch of colored coin development (basically, the mainstream one). We have three projects:
1. ArmoryX: (C++/Python) It was based on old version of Bitcoin Armory, it worked fairly well and was borderline usable, but we had to ditch it because there were too many problems with Bitcoin Armory. If there are Armory fans we can resurrect it and fix what needs to be fixed.
2. WebcoinX: (JS) web client, we have a prototype running on the testnet now:  User interface is mostly OK (it requires some fixes, though), but internals are rotten in some places.
3. CCoinDemo/coloredcoinlib/NGCCC: (Python) coloredcoinlib is a Python library which handles 'coloring',  and CCoinDemo is a very basic command-line client which is based on coloredcoinlib and pycoin. While it is half-assed, there isn't much code in it, and it is the best chance to make things right. There are also some possibilities for integration into Electrum.
All this stuff can be found in  except 
Also there is entirely separate implementation in bits of proof supernode, but I have no idea what's their current status.

Well, when attacker has access to your system, there isn't much you can do.
A long passphrase + slow key derivation function can guard your wallet in case attacker has read-only access to your system.
But this is at odds with convenience, obviously it is not so convenient to enter a long passphrase and then wait 10 seconds to do a transaction, is it?
Jaxx is meant to be a fast, convenient wallet for small sums of money.
Encrypting the seed with a PIN is a sham. I hope that fluffypony realizes that. Even if KDF takes 10 seconds (which is rather inconvenient already), it will take attacker 1 day to go through a 4-digit PIN on a single CPU.
So this isn't a vuln, it's a trade-off. If user takes care of securing his computer, he can enjoy fast transaction process.
If he doesn't trust his system, he should use a hardware wallet.
As for wallet encryption, it would certainly be nice if Jaxx offered that option, but it's understandable if they don't. If anything, it gives people a false sense of security.

Normal bitcoin nodes won't even accept them into their memory pools and they won't relay them.

Still, you have to win in a race.


While they might customize it a bit, it totally makes sense to run bitcoind.
Recently Mike Hearn mentioned that mining using anything else is a bad idea because it might cause network split and thus loss of revenue.
He even found a bug in bitsofproof which would cause network split if bitsofproof would be used for mining.
So, miners can customize bitcoind, but higher degree of customization means higher risk.

Ethereum contracts aren't Turing complete in CS sense, because contracts can use only a limited number of steps. Thus the Halting problem does not apply: we know that Ethereum contracts halt because they eventually run out of gas. All consequences of the Halting problem are irrelevant too: theoretically, you can analyze Ethereum contract's behavior through exhaustive search.
It's quite ironic that you mention "fundamental computer science" and demonstrate your lack of understanding of in the very next sentence.
The only practical difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum scripts is that Ethereum scripts have a key-value store attached to them, which they can read and write to. I can assure you that there is no CS theory which says that allowing reading &amp; writing suddenly makes things less secure and dangerous.
Yes, it's considerably more complex. But not fundamentally very different.

Just to clarify, this was just a technical demonstration, and we aren't using a real blockchain, it is simulated.
As for plans for the future, they are still being discussed, but most likely approach is a private/federated blockchain + anchoring in the Bitcoin blockchain.
[Here's]( a post about anchoring I wrote back in 2013. There was a change of terminology since then: what I call a 'side-chain' is more like an anchored private blockchain. Although it might be considered a sidechain too. As the post says, an anchored chain is at least as secure as the host blockchain (e.g. Bitcoin blockchain) w.r.t. irreversibility/immutability, but might be not censorship-resistant.

Suppose you had 10 BTC back in 2014. If you put 0.1 BTC into ETH crowdsale, you'd get `9.9 + 15.8 = 25.7 BTC`.
In worst case you'd still get your 9.9 BTC. Getting a chance to double your bitcoins paying only 1% is not a bad deal.
And "loose everything" scenario is pretty much impossible. Ethereum is not an average alt-coin, it was started by people who knew what they are doing, and they already have a working prototype at time of crowdsale, so chances of it disappearing were basically 0.

Ethereum uses PoW just like Bitcoin. (Well, somewhat different PoW algo, but the concept is the same.)
RSK will have blocks signed by member companies. Something like 20 members in their federation. Also same companies will control conversion between RSK-bitcoins and normal bitcoins.
So if the majority of these companies become corrupt, all bitcoins within RSK will be gone.


It doesn't really run on Bitcoin. It's a separate chain (sidechain) with 2-way peg, i.e. you can move bitcoins to and from that chain.
There are some plans to make it more integrated with Bitcoin in future, but I doubt that's going to work tbh.

Multi-sig changes the effective Bitcoin transaction confirmation throughput as it makes signatures bigger and thus fewer transactions fit into fixed blocks. Thus it affects "economic resource size".

Yes, there is a disconnect. Basically, Bitcoin-the-currency is backed by brand, infrastructure, community, "market cap" etc.  
The protocol is available to other cryptocurrencie (alt-coins), but they can't reuse aforementioned things which power Bitcoin-the-cryptocurrency. (Well, they indirectly benefit from Bitcoin infrastructure, but to a smaller degree.)
For example, Bitcoin will likely remain being the most secure option simple because block reward (and, thus, opportunity cost of double-spending) is the highest.
However, all this shouldn't be taken for granted, it is possible that it will be superseded by another cryptocurrency.

It's definitely used as a buzzword now, but I don't see why it can't be used as a legitimate tech term. There is currently no term for secure data replication.
Or, rather, a blockchain is a particular approach for secure data replication, the one which involves a chain of blocks.
Obviously, it's not the only one approach. For example, PBFT, widely known in academia, uses log replication and snapshots. But it has a lot of similarities with a blockchain, e.g. one might liken snapshots to blocks.
As for "hashing" itself, there is a term for that: [linked timestamping](
So perhaps one can call a blockchain a _replicated log with linked timestamping_.

If people are willing to put their money into a company with no revenue and a ton of risk, it's their right. But SEC makes it possible for an investor to make an informed decision instead of buying a cat in bag.
During the dotcom bubble, there were companies with bad business model, but they weren't outright scams, i.e. they didn't just run away with the money. That's exceedingly rare.

There is. It just works in a different way. Fees will have a huge effect on the Bitcoin economy, and, basically, developers define how they work. Miners typically just use default settings.
Besides that, default settings affect what constitutes a standard transaction, and that has a huge effect on innovative uses of Bitcoin. Basically, transactions which are not considered standard by default will have problems with propagation, so they are heavily discouraged and it is hard to use them commercially.
You might recall that recently "dust outputs" became non-standard. It has no effect on most Bitcoin users, but it makes serious problems for colored coin uses.


No, it wasn't, that's not how it works. Monetary policy exists as a consensus: developers agree to not change some constants in code. But in theory, they can. And if people will agree to apply those changes it will change for everyone.

I'm a wallet developer too and I fully agree with you.
Security isn't a sum of a features, it depends on user's behavior.
Initially we used the following approach: "Storing an encrypted seed, decrypting it at launch with a user password and keeping it only in RAM".
But it turned out that user's absolutely DO NOT want to use a strong password in a mobile app which is used for daily small payments, so the only effect the above approach has is to annoy the user making his experience worse.
So taking into account typical use for our app, we switched to storing non-encrypted seed.
Perhaps in future we will allow user to have two accounts: one with encryption and one without it.
What laypeople do not understand is that using a simple password like "1234" or "password" doesn't improve security even a tiny bit. Security needs to be analyzed against particular threats, and if we assume the attacker has access to a computer with a GPU and proper tools, then encrypting with PIN doesn't add anything to security, it is just a sham operation.

As far as I know, no. 
But I believe that Electrum is an SPV client. The use of Bitcoin protocol is overrated. De-facto Electrum connects to multiple Bitcoin nodes. It really doesn't matter what protocol it uses to do that. Multiple network protocols can exist at the same time, e.g. miners rely on "relay network" protocol which is different from normal Bitcoin protocol, and now several accelerated networks using special protocols  are in development/being deployed.
If you don't care about protocol then Electrum is an SPV wallet which can consult with a special trusted node using a protected channel, thus it should be immune against the attack I've described above.

If you believe that Ethereum is 'insecure', why don't you attack it and claim a $20B prize? You know you can short it, right?
It seems like you're insecure, and Ethereum is fine.


So basically you're dogmatic and unwilling to review your beliefs critically.


We need complex scripts to _enforce_ complex rules, running it on your own machine won't enforce them.


Bitcoin have been unscalable in this sense for 8+ years, yet we are here. Ethereum has a concept of state channels which generalize LN to arbitrary state machines, this can be done, but when transactions are relatively cheap it's unnecessary.




How so?


It does, but you can implement privacy features, such as ring signatures, in a contract.
Being Turing complete, Ethereum can emulate any other system. If you like UTXOs, you can do UTXOs within a contract. In fact, you can implement the whole Bitcoin, with mining and everything, within a contract.


Already exist: 


The concept of payment channels is MUCH older than Lightning.


Bitcoin isn't "freaking hard". It just isn't very extensible. People try to extend it through some crazy contraptions. Yet computer science tells us that all you need to make a 100% extensible and future-proof system is to make it Turing-complete.
From a theoretic point of view, there is huge complexity difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum models. Bitcoin transaction does some computations (runs scripts) and updates the database (UTXO database). Ethereum transactions run some computations (scripts) and updates the database.  The only difference is that Bitcoin's database is very inflexible.
Suppose Bitcoin's database structure allows certain optimizations, but that's just a constant factor. Completely irrelevant.

Basically, no. As far as I know majority of Bitcoin developers (i.e. people who actually understand the protocol) are OK with it. Only people who are superstitious think it is bad.
It's worth noting that it is modeled after [Smart Property]( concept, which was designed by one of Bitcoin core developers (Mike Hearn) and then another core developer, Jeff Garzik, started a colored coin implementation:

What do you mean by "monetized"?
Suppose there is an article which says something positive about the product you're selling. You want as many people as possible to see that article. SP-holders can bring that article to the top of SteemIt, and thus make millions of people to see it. (Assuming SteemIt grows big.) Thus you might pay SP-holders to upvote the article you want people to see.
Alternatively, ad agencies will buy SP to promote the content they want to promote.
A lot of ads already work that way. Banner ads are much less effective than an endorsement from a popular blogger. [Example](

I'll try to explain... There are so-called arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities. If there is one in a browser, attackers code will run in browser's process... And it can do anything any program on your computer can do.
I.e. it can read and write any files, do any kind of networking etc. Basically at that point whole machine is effectively owned, absolutely nothing is can be considered secure on it...
In reality it isn't so simple because of sandboxing...

I think you're getting too much into details. As a rule of thumb, eyeballs can be monetized. It's not like only Google and Facebook can figure it out. Pretty much every company which has a significant user base is valuable.
Steem doesn't need to use one of the existing business models, it might develop its own. We can only guess what it might be, as Steem is very different from everything else.


Yep, but Steem can enable a related, but different model: instead of paying a popular blogger to write a particular article, a company can just promote an article written by any blogger.
So a relationship between a blogger and a company is NOT required. Anybody can write an article, a company can just drive more attention to it if it says something positive about its product. This is less unethical, as a company doesn't influence article's content. (And note that the blogger will be rewarded though STEEM, so bloggers, in general, have an incentive to review products, etc. Writing a negative review might also be profitable: a competitor company might help to promote an article.)
But anyway, this was just one example of how SP might be valuable. It can also help talented-but-unpopular content producers to be discovered. E.g. if you have good content, you go to a STEEM whale and he upvotes you (if he likes your content). Then other people start upvoting you. Later people start following you and upvoting your content, so you no longer need to go to whales. I believe this is how SteemIt works now, in fact one of whales posted an article inviting new authors to contact him.
In any case, STEEM brings a new thing to the table: it makes "vote manipulation" legit. This essentially creates a free market for votes. I believe it can be a big thing. I sort of invented the same thing 10 years ago ([see here]( but didn't go forward with execution. A free market for upvotes might change the way ads and content monetization works, but we can only guess how it will pan out. 


To bootstrap the thing. This seems to work, people flock to the site because they hope they will be paid.
Or, maybe it, it will be the basis for content monetization in future, who knows.
It's also a way to boostrap the economy: a lot of people will get steem dollars, so they can start using that for trade, like buying goods etc.


But they already have something with bloggers, whales, markets, etc. It's small, but growing. It's not like they really need to optimize the platform for Coca-Cola to get a big payout, it can grow organically through various opportunities.


For the record, I do not recommend anyone to invest, I'm just saying it's potentially viable, i.e. I don't see a showstopper issue.
I don't think "inadvertent Ponzi" is a thing, Ponzi is, by definition, intentional. Do you mean that it's a bubble which can pop? This is true, Steem is much less mature than Bitcoin and Ethereum, but it's not worse than other 5-months-old alt-coins, I think.
@_date: 2016-07-13 05:26:25


Rewards might become smaller once more people will post content, but the total sum of rewards on STEEM will be much bigger than a total sum of rewards on Yours. Because STEEM rewards ultimately come from diluting currency holders, while Yours rewards are voluntarily donations. So unless STEEM market cap shrinks a lot, total rewards are going to be significant.
If Bitcoin had billions of users maybe then Yours could compete.


STEEM isn't as decentralized as Bitcoin, it uses a different consensus mechanism. 


Mike Hearn implemented a micropayment channel demo ~3 years ago. Then Streamium released a product based on channels about a year ago. So it sounds like micropayments is a solved problem.


Thank you, but my interest is largely academic. I've been researching "ways of incentivizing sharing great content and rewarding the hard people who make/curate it for all to enjoy" since 2006. I believe that STEEM is much better design than Yours, although not perfect.

I'm afraid people will be better off with multiple copies of ordinary paper wallets... Because letting someone to etch a private key for you undermines the purpose.

It's backed by faith that the cryptographic primitives which Bitcoin uses (ECDSA, SHA256) won't be broken, i.e. that mathematicians won't find a computationally cheap way to reverse ECDSA and SHA256 computations.
Also you need faith that people will keep choosing Bitcoin and not some other cryptocurrency.
This is very different from "faith that math does work".
FYI it's not yet proven that P =/= NP, also it's not proven that ECDSA breaking is in NP or that SHA256 preimage is in NP. So "math" just has no idea whether Bitcoin is secure or not.

Upcoming version of reference Bitcoin node will introduce a new type of standard transaction: "OP_RETURN &lt;up to 80 bytes of data&gt;".

Well, it is no so much treating them as untrusted as being careful with data.
Say, if data is text, you should insert it as text, not as html.


This also solves XSS problem.
I'd say doing it this way makes more sense than escaping strings on server, because:
 * createTextNode() DOM method guarantees that it will indeed be interpreted as text
 * (that's like parametrized SQL queries  vs. `mysql_real_escape_string()`)
 * you'll have no problems with double-escaping, unescaping and such


If app makes claim that some data is processed only on client-side and server cannot see it, I want its code to be open for inspection; and possibility of code injections make it problematic.


It would be interesting to inspect it, but I'd say using `.text()` instead of `.html()` doesn't equal scrubbing.


How do you verify that it has been used correctly?
It needs to go through all steps of the game to make sure that outcome is the same. Also perhaps it makes sense to log everything, including data sent from server, which should be signed.

Even after the DAO heist &amp; fork Ethereum is worth 1 billion USD. That's a lot.

2. Wright isn't Satoshi and Gavin is a part of a conspiracy.
I think the second option is MUCH more intriguing and I can't rule it out because Gavin already exposed himself as a non-trustworthy person.
There are other fishy details: if I understand correctly, Wright only produced a signature using a key which was already used in a transaction. He could have recovered key from a signature, so there is a possibility that ECDSA is broken.

If what you do fits into 64 bits you can simply use compiler/CPU integer division. One just needs to be careful with overflow &amp; precision.
Otherwise, there are libraries for long integers which usually implement division too, and can be used for fixed point arithmetic.
A ratio type can hide a complexity of handling precision explicitly. In my experience, it works quite well unless you do a lot of computations, then numbers can become too big (in terms of memory used), but I don't think it will be an issue for something like reward &amp; difficulty computation.
Finally, floating point math is not an issue by itself, the problem is that it's hardware accelerated, and thus not totally deterministic (i.e. different hardware can do things differently). If you use a software library which implements floating point math without using FP instructions then it can be 100% crossplatform and deterministic. I don't know any C/C++ libraries, but some other languages have that in the standard library. Perhaps GMP has something like that.

On options: the general idea of options is that you pay a fixed price to have an opportunity to buy or sell at a pre-determined price in future.
For example, if you buy call with strike price $80 and premium 0.1 BTC, that means that you need to pay 0.1 BTC right now to be able to buy 1 Bitcoin for $80 in future.
If it is settled in Bitcoins, you do not need to pay USD.
Suppose you bought a BTC call with strike $80 and premium 0.1 BTC. In future exchange rate is $160 per Bitcoin. This means that when you exercise this option, you get 0.5 BTC: option underwriter gives you 1 BTC, but you need to buy $80 worth of Bitcoin = 0.5 BTC at at current price, and 1 BTC - 0.5 BTC = 0.5 BTC. However, you need to take premium into account, so in the end your profit is only 0.4 BTC.
This is interesting because your potential loss is limited to premium, which is usually rather small. Also, you can both profit from increasing exchange rate and protect from falling exchange rate at the same time. (But it costs you premium if exchange rate doesn't change.)

Wake up and do what, exactly?
Ethereum gets so much interest because it has a different vision, perhaps more exciting to some people.
Bitcoin's vision is just money. Ethereum's vision is decentralized applications which are connected to money.
If Bitcoin's capacity problem is solved, this won't drive people who want to do tokens back to Bitcoin.
FYI first crypto tokens were issued on Bitcoin blockchain. I did that in September 2012. In January 2013 we had a trustless token market.
But tokens became second-class citizens on Bitcoin blockchain -- not officially supported and, often, discouraged, as it they were considered incompatible with Bitcoin's vision. People wanted to focus on money.
So we have that now. Of course, we need to address issues with Bitcoin, but you shouldn't assume that Ethereum will just go away if you do that.

Well, no. How do you use BitTorrent? You browse some kind of forum or site which lists what is available; you can read description, check media quality, read comments etc. And once you ready, you open a magnet link with your BitTorrent client.
Same can happen with auctions, i.e. listing happens on external sites. Maybe there will be also p2p listing too... 
The point is that actual trading is decoupled from listing, so same thing can be listed on many sites. (Just like many torrent sites can point to same swarm via a magnet link and DHT.)


I don't think it is a real problem.
It doesn't need to be perfect, it needs to be practical.


Did I mention I work on a p2p exchange? We have, like, an order book and stuff...We already have a proof-of-concept, but a lot of work needs to be done on making it robust and resilient.
But it is easier with auction since we have one seller and multiple buyers. Seller can coordinate it.


Seller will get partially signed transactions from all buyers. Once auction is complete, he will try to finalize transactions starting from highest bidder. If there is a double-spend, other bids can work.


Idealized model of auctions is centralized. In practice, however, you always have non-instant communications, so it inherently a decentralized system.
As I mentioned, in auction seller can provide synchronization and act as an authority, so in a way it can be considered being centralized.
For a general case of trading with many sellers and buyers, traders either need to accept less than perfect solution (but which solution is perfect if on high-profile exchanges traders set up their systems physically close to exchange's computer so that they are in a more favorable position?), or elect one entity to do synchronization. (It is acceptable because it is easy to switch to a different one when it is misbehaving.)

Well, neutrality is just _the_ rational behaviour.
@_date: 2013-10-08 07:33:39
There is no such thing as balance on Bitcoin protocol level, when somebody sends you Bitcoins he actually creates a coin (transaction output) which has your address written on it.
Thus an address can possess multiple coins, and each such coin can be spent independently from each other.
This is why sometimes you see same address used an input many times, e.g.
Each input is an individual coin with its unique identifier, but for convenience blockchain.info shows only addresses.
Thus, if you receive many payments, you HAVE to make a transaction with many inputs, there is no other way.
@_date: 2013-04-01 23:08:27


That's kinda a strange kind of reasoning...
There are several ways to make accepting zero confirmation payments secure, most of them revolve around trusting some kind of a payment processor. The idea is that you can trust a company whose business is secure payments (it cares a lot about its reputation), but you cannot trust some random punk.
Settling on insecure solution just because you want POS is kinda ass-backwards.
Another problem with your reasoning is that you think that all depends on availability of POS solutions. But there is a lot of applications besides POS, e.g. savings, internet payments and so on. Thus Bitcoin can be terribly successful even without POS.
Basically what you're saying "if my wet dream doesn't come true it all can as well go to hell".

Well, basically, what matters is total number of different passphrases which can be obtained by this method.
Suppose there are 40000 different words. Total number of different one-letter replacements (like A to X) is 26*25 = 650.
Now let's take each of 40000 words and apply this replacement, we get 26 million different combinations.
Note that if you simply combine two letters with a word, like, "AX wood", you also get 26 million combinations.

Good point, but... When I read the Bitcoin paper back in August of 2010, I understood that it might be good w.r.t. security, but it cannot scale, so I expected Bitcoin to die when people actually start using it...
If I wasn't so skeptical about scalability I could be a rich person now :) So I'm not going to do a same mistake again. It isn't all-or-nothing, colored coins already can be useful for a lot of things.
And in a long run, if there is a problem, it would be possible to migrate to a different platform. But, you know, it is a good problem to have.
I believe that it is possible to re-design Bitcoin protocol in such a way that scalability will be much less of a problem. Of course, it isn't suitable for HFT, but it is possible to implement a hybrid solution where parties will do off-blockchain trade and then will settle  things with a real transaction. You know, we have multi-sig scripts, contracts and stuff like that.

Well, with traditional model you need same company to be present on both sides, e.g. transfer from Western Union office to Western Union office.
With Bitcoin, it is more decentralized: You need one company on sender's side, and another on receiver's side.
E.g. in USA we already have several exchanges like Coinbase etc. 
So we now we only need companies to handle Bitcoin-&gt;local currency conversion.
Presumably, that's somewhat easier... Quite likely such a company would need to be able to do international bank wires (receive money from MtGox), so it needs to interact with banks, but perhaps it is easier to set it up in one direction.
Once market for Bitcoins kicks in, you might have an exchange which works only with local banks/payment systems: it is expected that some traders will try arbitrage via foreign trade. (So that would be complete decentralization of transfers.)
We saw this happen with kapiton.se exchange which offers only local bank transfers in Sweden... Initially volume was very low and spread was huge, sometimes price was outright ridiculous. But now it got more reasonable and there is some depth.
All in all, Bitcoin can handle one side of trade, and another can be decentralized, so it kinda helps.

You create unspendable outputs to store hash of document, it is a bad idea, as miners will have to keep these UTXOs in memory forever, hence it adds to costs...
You can instead create 1-of-2 multisig script where one public key is your real public key and another one is just fake key which holds hash data. Then you spend it using your private key.
Transaction with hash of document will be timestamped, but it won't create UTXOs... It is friendlier to the network and costs you less.

Tell about it to people who can actually benefit from it.
For example, the appropriate use of Bitcoin is transfer of money across borders where such transfer is problematic otherwise. Say, some countries have retarded currency control laws. But it is possible to do this only if there is market for Bitcoins on both sides.
If people have a calamity within a country, it is unlikely that Bitcoin will help. Unless you see some particular solution to a particular problem... IN which case you should mention that instead of saying like "you should use Bitcoin".

Apparently you do not know about Bitcoin-based multi-sig escrow. It can be person to person.
Basically both participants (or just one of them) sends Bitcoins to an address which requires signatures of both participants to unlock it.
If either of them refuses signing, money stays locked.
There is a lot of variations of this theme, for example, it is possible to use a 3rd party mediator, or have auto-release of funds.
You can even set up it to work identical to your side (as far as I understand): both parties risk 1 BTC, and if they don't agree and release funds, after some timeout it goes to charity.

Well, you need to understand that so far miners have been altruistic: they just run standard bitcoind code with very few tweaks, they aren't actively trying to optimize their payoffs.
But it won't be the case when competition becomes fierce and margins become thin.
Currently electricity costs are tiny as compared to amount of bitcoins which are mined by ASIC hardware.
But consider a situation where 90% of mined bitcoins are used to pay for electricity... If you can increase your payoffs by 1%, your profits will be increased by 10%... And we are talking about large mining operations, not beer money.
So you can expect that if there is a way to increase pay-offs, it will be used.
I think things will get more interesting after next reward halfing: at that point miners' margins can go to shit while fees can become a significant portion of income. I'm fairly certain that we'll see some spectacular miner "warfare".
As for your argument, I don't see an argument here, it is just an ad hominem attack.
Also I don't think you understand the current situation... Bitcoin is NOT game-theoretically sound, and one thing we know for sure is that the current rules are not sustainable.
So it isn't about finding flaws... Everybody already knows that it is flawed.
It is about finding models which will allow us to find a stable and sustainable solution.
Also, while you can expect that it will eventually converge to a stable situation in any case, isn't it better to know what it is in advance than just let miners to decide it among themselves?

This is a situation similar to the tragedy of commons: everybody selfishly tries to minimize his own risk, but centralization which arises from these actions increase risks for everybody. 
You shouldn't underestimate the risk of centralization: even if pool operators are benevolent, somebody might hijack their systems... Have you heard about stuxnet? Hijacking pools is pretty much trivial compared to _that_. There is also a possibility of physical attack: how much does it cost to hire thugs to attack pool operators?
It is a fact that we have many cryptocurrencies now (and we'll likely have more players in future), and attack on Bitcoin might be beneficial for some of them.

Well, normally you have one input and two outputs: one for change, another is zero-value output with OP_RETURN script.
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:07:14
Scripting language allows an infinite loop, but user who submits the transaction selects maximum amount of gas it can consume (and has to pay for that gas with ether). When EVM executes the script it keeps track of gas used, so if script does too many iterations in a loop, it is aborted. Thus there are zero problems with Turing completeness on EVM level.
On top of that there is a gas limit per block which guarantees that the whole block doesn't take too much time to compute.
Turing completeness is more of a problem on a semantic level: _sometimes_ it is hard to prove that the script does what you think it does.
E.g. suppose somebody gives you a script in a compiled form. There is only one function which can be called `run()`. It might update contract's internal state. It might also call internal function `halt()`, which make you lose money. So you want to know if it will ever call `halt()`.
Halting theorem says that it's impossible to write a program which will analyze arbitrary script telling you if it ever calls `halt()` or not.
So if you were planning to write a program which automatically analyzes Ethereum scripts, Turing completeness is certainly a problem for you.
But this is a very contrieved scenario. It doesn't bother end users.
Typically contracts are given in source form, and they can be analyzed -- manually or automatically.
What Halting theorem says is that some contracts are un-analyzable. But that doesn't mean that all of them are.
And again, EVM doesn't care about contract analysis, it just executes them, and it always performs a finite number of steps, so it's irrelevant.

People want to be able to trade stocks on secondary market. E.g. if in case you need money, you'll sell shares you have to other guys at the current market price.
But how do you find guys who want to buy shares, how do you make a deal, how are shares transferred, how do you make sure that you get real, valid shares, and other parties won't fool you in some way?
Well, we could make a web site for that... But as you can guess, owner of that web site will have a lot of power, and if site fails it will make a lot of damage.
A year ago a Bitcoin stock exchange called GLBSE have closed. It created  a lot of problems both for investors and for issuers (investors were not able to sell their shares for several months).
A week ago another Bitcon stock exchange declared that it is closing down in several weeks. This resulted in panic, and some assets were sold at 10% of their value before announcement, so you can imagine some people lost a lot of money on it.
And in these two cases operators were benevolent, no Bitcoins were lost. It was a lucky case. Imagine would will happen if will lose or steal Bitcoins which people hold on accounts...
Anyway, apparently there is a problem with stock exchanges which are basically web sites.
Can we make some sort of decentralized market, where people won't have to rely on centralized services?

If transaction is in mempool they will ignore all transactions which spend same inputs.
Zero-fee transaction might not even get into mempool, but there is a window of opportunity when it can get into mempool but miners following standard rules won't include it into the block.  But there are miners who allow smaller fees.

Currently the standard minimum fee is 0.0001 BTC per kilobyte. A typical transaction with one input is about 250 bytes long, thus you need to pay as little as 0.000026 BTC. 
It is only $0.013 USD at $500 USD per BTC. Less than 2 cents.
The problem is largely in inane wallet software. Calculating fees properly is pretty much trivial, but a lot of developers struggle with it. Fuckers. (I've developed wallet software myself and I'm guilty of this myself, to be honest. But my wallet is in alpha stage, so it's OK. I plan to do it properly in future.)
On the other hand, taking fee away is a bad idea. It's really not a problem to pay 2 cents, is it?
Also it's worth noting that Bitcoin really isn't for tiny-tiny transaction: each transaction is replicated among many nodes and needs to be stored in blockchain forever. It's not free, and we don't want to pollute blockchain with tiny, meaningless transfers.

Well, the whole point of such an attack is to generate negative publicity.
'Six confirmations' is like a standard now. If people will realize they have to wait, like, a day to settle a large transaction, Bitcoin would look unfavorable compared to Ripple, for example.
Currently the argument against Ripple is that it isn't decentralized enough. But if somebody will demonstrate that Bitcoin can be pwned by attacking a handful of mining pools, this argument will no longer work.
Alternatively, one of proof-of-stake coins (PPCoin?) might look like a solution to Bitcoin problems: it's much harder to hijack PoS miners.
Do you agree that there is a problem with PoW consensus, and other forms of consensus solve it?
In any case, this won't kill Bitcoin, but can result in substantial price drop, which is exploitable.


Well, people who own mining hardware are not interested in attacks.
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:26:06
Exactly. I'd say just leave size limit in place: people will learn how to do transactions more efficiently.
1. do periodic payouts less frequently
2. use off-chain transactions where trust isn't an issue
3. if payment isn't urgent, multiple payments can be aggregated into one transaction
E.g. we can add "add to send buffer" button to client, which works somewhat similar to "add to cart".
Suppose I want to donate to 0.1 BTC  to SeansOutpost, but it isn't critical when the payment goes, so I will click "add to send buffer" instead of "send immediately".
A hour later I buy something via BitPay, this time I click "send immediately", and transaction will be sent both to SeansOutpost and to BitPay. It is more efficient because fewer txins/txouts will be used. You will save almost 50% in fees.
It is pretty much trivial to add this functionality, but nobody bothers because Bitcoin transactions are dirt cheap.
Make blockchain space scarce, and solutions will appear in no time.

I wouldn't call Satoshi an average guy... While he didn't have God-like skills in any particular field, he had an unique combination of skills which made Bitcoin possible, i.e.
 * good grasp of cryptography
 * decent programming skills (yes, his code was sub-par in terms of quality, but he was able to implement a fairly big project in relatively short amount of time, and it didn't have too many problems)
 * understanding of game-theoretic and economic aspects
 * inventor's skills, i.e. something which allowed design ingenuity
I think it's worth comparing Bitcoin to Hal Finney's RPOW. If we assume that RPOW design is 'normal' (obviously, Hal far from 'average guy'), you can really see that Satoshi have gone an extra mile and make considerably more elegant and feature-rich design. He didn't _have_ to implement script-based input validation, you know.

So, please, avoid general statements like this.
Of course, there are bad kinds of off-chain payment systems too... Say, inputs.io: it's just an e-wallet, and it can disappear at any time. Yet they call it off-chain payment system like it's something fancy.

VISA is not easy to understand or explain either. And banking system in general... I read a lot about it, but still my understanding is very vague.
Let's say somebody sends you money from a foreign country. How does it work?
Foreign bank will contact your bank, then they will find bank which they both have account in, and transfer money via account in that bank.
If there is no such bank, they will try to find a chain of transfers which would work.
The point is, average person does not know this and does not give a fuck. He just gets VISA card and uses it to purchase things in stores. He trusts the system without understanding how it works because everybody does this.
Maybe I'm somewhat biased here, but, say, blockchain.info's My Wallet is already of magnitude easier to use than bank-VISA-PayPal clusterfuck, seriously.
Consider this situation: you do not have a bank account and you need to buy something off ebay via PayPal, what do you do? You need to go to bank, open an account, deposit money, get VISA card for them, register PayPal account, connect VISA card to it (it often requires verification), and only then you can spend your money.
That's crazy amount of work, but people are just used to it.
I'm fairly certain that people will get used to Bitcoin if it has advantages and other people use it. (I.e. network effect.)

Obvious pump&amp;dump is obvious, but I will explain:
Usually you do not need to wait for confirmations when you accept Bitcoin payments:
1. For small-scale purchases which need to be instant (e.g. buying hamburgers) people can use web wallets and green addresses or internal transfers. There are also more advanced forms of it involving escrow and payment processors.
2. For large-scale purchases you probably need to wait anyway...
3. You need to check for confirmations before you ship goods, but if you do not ship them instantly wait time doesn't matter much.
4. Exchanges can use risk control and flexible policies. E.g. if somebody deposits 1 BTC and sells them for USD, exchange can allow sale instantly, but wait for 2 confirmations before allowing withdraw or transfer. If somebody deposits 1000 BTC maybe he needs 3 confirmations before he can trade and 6 before he can withdraw...

There are many possible solutions to scalability problem... Sure, we can just say "fuck that" and increase block size limit.

There are many ways to implement secure off-chain systems (not inputs.io syle :) ), payment aggregation etc.
E.g. maybe we can make a wallet software which is intelligent enough to join transactions from many people who buy coffee from a particular vendor into a large one, and it will be more efficient.

No, that's not how it works.
People say that banks "create money out of thin air" because money exists both on depositor's account and it is also lent out. So you get 19 BTC total out of 10 BTC.
But money which exists on depositor's account isn't 'hard' money, it is just the sum which bank owes to depositor. And depositor can transfer that sum to other person... (So that bank owes another person instead.)
This is how Ripple works, by the way. Ripple is zero-reserve banking.

I believe that one of main advantages is peer to peer nature of Bitcoin, which means that no paperwork and no intermediaries are required.
It might be simply a convenience question: you do not need any paperwork to open a bitcoin account, you do not even need a registration.
So, basically, Bitcoin might drastically reduce transaction 'friction' in some cases.
But it might be crucial in some cases. Say, I live in a country where getting money from abroad requires a lot of paperwork. This means I cannot sell any products internationally, as my customers won't like signing contracts just to purchase a product.
I don't even mind paying taxes, but my government simply doesn't leave me such an option.

Idiot. Here's definition from wikipedia:


Basically, if it is a currency, you can directly buy something with it. If it is commodity, you need to sell it first, acquire currency, and then buy something with it.
Well, there is also a barter, but transactions which use currency are much more typical.
And, yes, commodity can be used as a basis for a currency, e.g. gold coins, but not every commodity is a currency.


We were talking about scenario where world's economy is running on bitcoins, which would put market cap on scale of $50T in today dollars.
Suppose dude has $2500T. Buying something for $1T won't be a problem since it will devalue currency only by 2%. And dude can repeat $1T purchases thousand of times.


You have just described why it is a problem for bitcoins: it can potentially create a lot of turmoil, even potentially distrust in Bitcoin itself.
Don't forget that we already have a lot of cryptocurrencies, so people will be able to pick more stable ones.
Let's consider a more realistic example: dude has 10% of world's currency reserves. It is realistic because there are people with 500k BTC in one address. Quite possible there are people who have a million bitcoins or so.
That would be like $5T in $50T economy. Having $5T you easily buy 5 world's biggest corporations, and use change to buy the government (I mean, lobby the shit out of it...).
Also 10% dumped on Fx market would create a lot of turmoil, potentially initiating exodus to a different currency.
For example, 11M bitcoins are now in existence, so 10% of that would be 1.1M. Daily volume on mtgox rarely exceeds 100k BTC. So if somebody will dump 1.1M BTC onto mtgox, he will wipe out whole orderbook, sending price to pennies. Sure, that would be sort of dumb, but it will kinda destroy bitcoin, at least temporarily.
You see, 10% dump when currency is young isn't such a big problem. But when world's economy depends on it, it will be disastrous.
Is it even possible to fix this problem? Yes, I believe, that's quite easy: make reward 50 coins per block forever. Contrary to popular belief, it isn't inflationary. Inflation will be only 1% per year in 100 years, 0.1% per year in 1000 years. Pretty much negligible.
But the thing is, early adopters will get very nice profit, but not outlandish. Particularly, nothing changes in first 4 years, so one who bought bitcoins at $0.008 could get 1000x return (100000%) 3 years later.
But libertards will of course cry that it's too inflationary and 100000% return is too small for them.

If encrypted data is publicly available security depends on entropy of passphrase you're using, so it _cannot be_ more secure than a brainwallet.
Encrypted wallet is more secure than brainwallet only if encrypted data is kept secret: then attacker has both to obtain encrypted data _and_ to guess a password.

OK, first of all let's try to understand what give a national currency its value.
It is largely an economic activity within the country: If country produces and exports a lot of goods, its national currency (usually) appreciates.
So, maybe, it's the same thing for Bitcoin: an economic activity of Bitcoin community gives it a value.
You can actually see this if you consider alt-coins, Bitcoin copycats: most of them are based on Bitcoin source code and have almost same exactly properties, [yet market cap is very different]( How can this happen?
It isn't so hard to see that it is about community. Say, a year ago Litecoin community was really energetic and passionate about it, and as a result Litecoin price went up 100x against USD. Currently Litecoin has biggest market cap of all alt-coins.
And there was some real economic activity around Litecoin, say, LitecoinGlobal stock exchange had many companies listed on it.
(I'm not trying to pump Litecoin here, in fact I can say that it looks like golden days for the Litecoin community are over.)

It isn't about hardware, it is about cost of attack. You need &gt;50% of total hashpower to mount a successful attack, and that costs a lot.


No, it isn't. At some points new blocks will stop creating new money, but miners still earn fees.


1. Attacker can only rewrite history, i.e. replace one transaction with another.
2. It's unlikely that botnet can be significant now when it needs to compete with ASICs.
3. It's likely impossible to do anything without purchasing or manufacturing large quantities of ASIC miners to overpower the rest of the network.
4. If somebody manages to do that (i.e. &gt;50% attack), we are fucked. Perhaps they will switch to a different mining hashing algo.

Multi-signature transactions. User deposits his money into a service in such a way that to unblock it both his signature and service's signature are required. Thus user cannot get his money back without service's approval, and service cannot spend user's money either...
Of course, situation where nobody can get the money is possible, but likely there is an economic incentive for both participants. It's different from a situation where it is economically optimal to run away with all the money.
I don't see how colored coins are related, by the way, they solve a different kind of a problem: truly decentralized markets allow full anonymity. I.e. I do not need to register anywhere to trade colored coins.

What kind of payment processors?
Many payment processors are able to do internal transactions _for free_. A decentralized system can't compete with that.
Now if we talk about cross-border payments... $5 is the minimum for WU, I think. Bank wire costs one $30+.
Online purchases using credit/debit cards add up to 2% for online payments, that's $2 on a $100 transactions.
Transactions smaller than $100 can be done using payment channels (or even a shared wallet for trivial amounts). They are not widespread yet _because_ fees are so small.

You probably happen to think that if somebody is of no immediate use to you, then it "makes no sense".
There is a plenty of use cases for a blockchain which Bitcoin doesn't handle well.
Let's take, for example, insurance. You need a pool of money which can be slowly drained through payouts, but cannot be stolen all at once.
Bitcoin doesn't have means to implement such a pool. You can try to emulate that through multi-sig or something like that, but that is very complex. So very few people do that kind of stuff.
In Ethereum you can implement insurance pool mechanics directly, it can be coded directly in a smart contract.
So this is why Ethereum is interesting, it allows one to code custom blockchain behaviour with ease. Maybe you don't find it interesting because you only use bitcoins for savings. But the idea is that in future we will be able to use cryptocurrencies for all kinds of things, like insurance, investments, derivative trading and so on. Presumably, it will increase transparency and reduce overhead.

How hard is it to remember 12 English words, like:


I think it isn't very hard, especially if you add some glue words and make a poem out of it or something.
This phrase encodes 128 bits of entropy.
To make your own, go here: 
Select from: hex, to:  poetry. If you write some random hex (e.g. `cat /dev/random | hexdump`) it will generate words. 
(Of course, you need to do this on offline computer.)
EDIT: If you do not trust this source of randomness, you can obtain a random string by any means: dice, shuffling cards, etc. Calculate SHA-256 of that phrase and then encode those bytes using "poetry" to remember them. Alternatively, PGP word list can be used:

Yes, probably they cannot just switch to Bitcoin, but Bitcoin might be a part of solution.
For example, here in Ukraine we also have ass-backwards currency laws, basically the only legal way for entrepreneur or contractor to get money from a foreign counter-agent is to get bank wire transfer (which costs ~$30) accompanied by a multi-page paper contract. So, basically, it makes sense to do it if the sum you transfer is big enough, and only if you're valuable for a counter-party to go through this shit.
But it is simply not feasible to do this for small-scale freelancing. So freelance sites (e.g. oDesk) offer to use an intermediary like Payoneer. Freelancer can get a Payoneer debit card which works with any ATM. It is illegal according to Ukrainian laws, but Payoneer is registered in some offshore zone and does not give a fuck. 
On the other side, Payoneer looks like [more-or-less legit company](
Now the problem is that the cut companies like Payoneer get is significant. Also they collect identification information so in theory one can get problem with law.
Probably something like this can work with Bitcoin, where a public company will use intermediary of some sort to shield itself from accusations. On the other end, use of Bitcoin instead of payment cards might reduce costs and legal risks

Custom mining software...
If you're running a mining botnet, you probably do not want to use a pool since it is a potential point of failure. Each machine can mine on its own.
However, normally you need a node with fully downloaded blockchain form mining, but that is undesirable in context of botnet: you never know whether machine has enough bandwidth, disk space. And you lose some money while it downloads blockchain...
Solution: mine empty blocks. You only need block headers to do that, so footprint is much lower. Fees are usually small compared to reward, so you aren't losing much on it.
BTW you can mine using a regular virus this way. With such configuration, you don't need command &amp; control center: each virus instance can be 100% independent of anything, it just needs your address to send coins to.

This is cool, but why not release such software for all cryptocurrencies? Obviously, it is just a tactics to make it seem that there is something behind this feathercoin thing and pump price up...

This happens because more efficient ASICs are deployed. 
Once all of them will be deployed, hashrate will be huge and profits will diminish.
CoinTerra is going to mass-produce highly efficient 28nm ASICs. After they will be deployed it will be over.
Of course, eventually somebody will make even more efficient ASICs, say, 14nm ones. It will produce another growth spurt, but it will be smaller than what you see now.
You see continuous growth now because we went through three generations (110nm, 65/55nm, 28nm).

Such service could work in a way similar to how blockchain.info wallet works: 
Private key is created in browser, and is never stored on server, at least not in non-encrypted form.
Obviously, it is possible to generate cards to be printed on client side, and these cards will either have private key on them, or they will have a key which can be used to decrypt private key.
So there are indeed no reasons to trust a service like that, aside from the fact that nobody bothered to implemented  a more secure version yet.

Yes, you can combine them.
But sometimes using a coin costs more fees than it's worth... (I think currently cut-off is about 2000 satoshi.) Although maybe you can find a miner who accepts tiny-tiny fees...


Transaction consists of inputs and outputs. Inputs spend previous outputs. If you do it in other way it won't work as clearly and securely, I think,
In theory it is possible to optimize transactions which has many inputs from the same address: they could all use same signature.
However, BItcoin isn't optimized for this... As I mentioned, re-using same address isn't a norm. Also, it's better to keep it simple...
It makes more sense to optimize it on sending side: avoid sending tiny-tiny amounts.
They could instead use some centralized clearing system for such, moving money within  web wallet without making actual Bitcoin transactions. Sure, it isn't as secure as a real Bitcoin wallet, but do you really care about amounts less than one USD penny? You can trigger payout as soon as you get 0.001 BTC, for example.
So I think the real problem is services which mis-use Bitcoin and wallets which use sloppy fee calculation and coin selection algorithms.

Yes, that's the idea, but I can't say colored coins provide exactly same functionality as Ripple does.
It's more like it is possible to implement Ripple's most important features on top of colored coins, i.e. it is possible to issue IOUs etc.
I think Bitcoin's main advantage is potential anonymity of miners: Bitcoin does not depend on a particular company and particular individuals to verify transactions.
If governments decide that decentralized currencies are illegal, they can go after everybody involved in Ripple, and by the nature of it, this information isn't secret by the nature of it (Ripple relies on trusted verifiers).
I think all they need is to shut down OpenCoin, then it will dissolve as members would not want to have problems with law.
However, in case with Bitcoin, attacks are anticipated, and network is built on trust-no-one concept.
Also people think that Bitcoins are distributed in fair way, unlike XRP.
So even if Ripple is technically superior, my money is on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the kind of money we need when we cannot trust the government and corporations.
Ripple.com might have uses too, but it doesn't look like a good long-term plan to me.

Yes, futures are settled in Bitcoins. I mentioned that you need to move them to MtGox to close position.


It is true that it is not 100% risk-free, but it is pretty close to that.
Settlement price is 24h average on mtgox on that day. So maximum difference between settlement and spot is how much mtgox can move in a day.
However, you only have to keep initial margin on ICBIT, so you can sell ~85% of Bitcoins before settlement, so your loss from change is mtgox price can't be too large.
E.g. suppose 24h average is 80, but after settlement it becomes 70. You sell 85 BTC  and 15 BTC  so you get $7850 instead of $8000. This isn't a bad result considering that volatility is pretty large.
Also, you can close your position on ICBIT before settlemnt to make exposure to fluctuations even smaller.


This isn't true, futures price becomes close to spot price few days before settlement.
Bitcoin volatility is insane, 10% price swings within one day are not uncommon, so compared this difference between mtgox and icbit prices isn't big.
However, yes, too few people arbitrage on ICBIT because they do not trust it, I think.
@_date: 2013-10-18 07:14:18
Probably not. 
But that's not a problem: you can "confirm" transactions by other means.
Basically, you just need to know that double-spend is highly unlikely. There are several ways to do that: green addresses, multi-signature transactions involving a trusted party and so on.
For example, suppose there is a registry of green addresses. To get a green address user needs to sacrifice some small amount of bitcoins (paying them as a fee).
If user double-spends, evidence can be added to registry (two signed transactions which spend same coins), and so merchants will stop trusting this green address.
So it doesn't make sense to double-spend when amount doesn't exceed the amount which was sacrificed to register a green address.
And it's good for the network: miners get more fees from these sacrifices.
Isn't it nice?

When you use WU you use just one intermediary: WU itself.
But if you'll use Bitcoin in same way (cash to cash), you will use at least two intermediaries (exchanges on both ends). Additionally, you're exposed to exchange rate fluctuations, and might need to pay bid-ask spread once.
In worst case four additional parties will get involved: bank-&gt;exchange-&gt;(bitcoin transfer)-&gt;exchange-&gt;bank. (It might be payment system instead of bank, but you got the idea.)
Yeah, the most important function of Bitcoin is one which it doesn't handle well and one which requires multiple additional parties to be present in all countries. This TOTALLY makes sense.

Yep. it is pretty much trivial. Yet we now have at least 4 VC-backed companies doing this now:
 * chain.com
 * gem.co
 * blocktrail
 * blockcypher
in addition to non-VC-backed ones:
 * helloblock.io
 * blockr.io
 * insight.is
 * blockexplorer.com
 * toshi.io
 * blockchain.info
So, apparently, there is nothing special about blockchain APIs and block explorers, you can literally just download open source code, rent a server and roll out your own. So why do VCs give millions of dollars to there companies? What is the monetization plan?
I think they just happen to have relevant buzzwords:
 * enterprise software
 * cloud
 * Bitcoin
All these things are in trend trend now, so VC don't care that there is no plausible monetization strategy. I think VCs are betting the fact that if cryptocurrencies become big, tech giants will start buying companies which have relevant experience.

0-conf double-spends are hard only because of mempool semantics, but it isn't enforced in any way.
I believe it's quite likely that miners will adopt replace-by-fee policy when block reward drops and they will start looking for a way to increase fees they receive. Such a policy is game-theoretically rational.
On the other hand, it is likely that by that time people will either start using off-chain payment systems for small purchases, or use something like green addresses / fidelity bonds / instant payment operators.
There is no need to use person's name to create a recognizable identity: it can be tied to his Bitcoin address.

There are several problems with a "new chain" approach:
1. People want a decentralized USD&lt;-&gt;BItcoin exchange. People want their securities to be traded for Bitcoins. "New chain" does not help with it in any way. 
3. We already have something like colored coins implemented on a different technology: it is called Ripple. The advantage of colored coins over Ripple is better integration with Bitcoin. Without it it is largely pointless.
2. It would take a while until "new chain" host currency stabilizes, and until that happens, trading is largely pointless. If you trade colored coins for other colored coins there is a counter-party risk, so Bitcoin's appeal is largely eliminated.
4. I think nobody wants to make just a Bitcoin clone with native colored coin support. People want other features too. For example, a solution for scalability problems. But developing such features is hard, and so it's unlikely we'll see them soon.
So I believe that new chain is a potential long-term solution, but it doesn't rule out Bitcoin-based colored coins. (FYI I was doing alt-chain research before I got into colored coins project.)
That said, Freicoin people seem to be serious about adding native colored coins support to Freicoin.

1. It doesn't really launder money, since it is possible to see connection between address which pays exorbitant fee and address which receives block reward. Basically, it is same as sending coins to your address while mixing them with other coins.

They can go after individual issuers, and we cannot do anything about it. The thing is, with Ripple they can attack _both_ issuers _and_ nodes which sign transactions. So attack area is bigger.
Also I believe it is harder to attack issuers because issuers do not participate in any transactions. They just guarantee that coins will be redeemable at some point, I don't see how it is a punishable offence.
So colored coins effectively decouple issuance from trading. (Transactions and trading is handled by miners which can be anonymous.)
If you're concerned about attack on issuers, it is possible to take precautions, e.g. several independent issuers can guarantee a currency. Perhaps some party can simply insure coins in case primary issuer fails.


Well, in theory you can use Bitcoins held in escrow, or fidelity bonds. I don't know how practical it is.

You do not need to have full amount to trade futures, you only need to have enough for initial margin.
Initial margin for 800 contracts is 12.8225 BTC. It covers approximately 10% price move, i.e. if exchange rate goes 10% down you will be out of initial margin, so you either need to add more to your balance or to close your position.
So 30 BTC cover something like 30% move, it is good idea to have some margin available so you won't be "margin called".

A short recap: about two years ago I wanted to implement a derivatives trading/prediction market kind of thing. But holding user's funds in a wallet on site didn't feel right (you know, service operator can simply run away with all the money...), so I've closed the service after running alpha version for a couple of weeks. 
I've heard that so-called multi-signature transactions can fix this problem, so I thought I just need to wait a little until  they get commonly used, and they I'll be able to implement my service in a secure fashion.
Apparently these concerns did not stop other people. I've been testing my derivative testing platform in June of 2011. In autumn of 2012 Zhou Tang launched Bitcoinica. Which was pretty successful for some time. Unit it got robbed (or "robbed"), twice. 
Then we witnessed downfall of Kronos.io, Mooncoin, Betcoin, Bitscalper... Full list is available [here](
Meanwhile, I'm still waiting for a solution which will not require users to trust service THAT much. Users need to trust the service they are using, but service shouldn't be able to rob them overnight, or get robbed overnight.
Recently I've [asked]( about implementations. But, if I understood answers correctly, it's unlikely we'll get something usable soon. (Well, etotheipi might be doing something in this direction, but I'm not sure it will work for use cases I want.)
So, well, I'm going to try to implement it myself, basically. Implementation isn't hard, hard part is to get all developers to agree on the same vision, but this is not required for proof-of-concept implementation.
[Here's]( how I see it in terms of user interface.
But I'm going to listen to opinions. My goal is to develop solutions which cover a wide spectrum of problems and use cases.

They get all facts right, but it is macroeconomically illiterate.
Basically, a whole economy does not work in same way as one household.
A country won't default on its debt when it is denominated in a currency it controls. It can simply print more currency.
This is where macroeconomic effects kick in:
1. Workers get less due to inflation.
2. Locally-produced products become relatively cheap.
3. Country starts exporting more goods, which shifts trade balance to positive.
4. Nominal GDP grows (and so does real GDP, due to increasing exports)
5. Debt-to-GDP ratio decreases.
The reason why Japan's debt is 200+% of GDP is that it was trying to inflate its own currency for 25 years. It isn't easy, as it turns out.
The concept that expansion of monetary base leads to hyperinflation is simply wrong. It's been demonstrated by decades of evidence.
Krugman wrote more about this, [for example](


model, it’s Figure 1 – they’re imagining that American macroeconomics are just like **those of a country 
on a fixed exchange rate with no independent monetary policy.**
I understand that you'll probably claim that my post is "**Keynesian propaganda**", but these are just **facts**.
I'm not trying to hide the fact that workers become poor when shit hits the fan. That's just how it works: Existing salaries are unsustainable and need to be decreased to fixed trade balance.
If you don't like it, well, move to other country.
Same thing about savings: If you were saving Japanese yen, you will suffer.
But saving Japanese yen is asinine in the first place, yen isn't a currency you want to keep savings in.
By all means, just buy stocks, gold, Bitcoins or real estate, and you won't be exposed to yen fluctuations.
It isn't news that fiat currency is bad for long-term store of value, it isn't meant to be used this way. It is meant to be flexible so real value of salaries can go down when "necessary".
You don't like it?
Now suppose salary was denominated in Bitcoins. Suppose back in December when Bitcoin price was $13 I made an agreement with employer that that I get 300 BTC per month. That was $3900 worth of Bitcoins.
Now in August he needs to pay me $30000 worth of Bitcoins.
Obviously, such an employer will go out of business, unless his revenues suddenly go 10x up... 
So it makes no sense to have salaries Bitcoin-denominated. We need some kind of unit which is _artificially_ pegged in such a way that it doesn't fluctuate that much. Such a peg is a feature, not a bug.
Same thing happens with debt: if you happened to borrow 300 BTC in December, you're fucked, unless all your cash streams are in Bitcoins...
That is, if you sell some kind of physical goods which do not go 10x up in value, you're fucked.
Again, you need a different kind of unit. Using Bitcoin here makes no effing sense.
If you masturbate to news about how fiat currencies suck and everything should be Bitcoin, you're no better than a sports fan who thinks that team he roots for is the most important thing in the world. You're missing lots of important considerations.
Fiat currencies have their purpose. If anything, to rob workers when it is necessary. Such is life.
Bitcoin isn't a solution. It might be _a part of_ solution_. But masturbating to doomy videos does not help, at all.

1. In my case, international wire transfer usually takes 3 days to get to my bank account. Then I need at a day or two to withdraw.
2. Some withdrawal methods on btc-e seems to be very fast, but they also cost a lot in commission.
However, I believe that cash-&gt;Bitcoin-&gt;cash transfer isn't a great idea. Effectively you just use bitcoins to move money between two exchanges. But some exchanges allow you to move USD, or you can just withdraw USD from same account in a different country. So this is not different from USD-pegged digital currencies like Liberty Reserve.
Maybe in some cases it makes sense (e.g. when you know a local dude who will buy coins from you for cash), but it isn't the best use case, and it is definitely not a replacement to Western Union/MoneyGram/wire transfers.
Bitcoin makes a lot more sense when it is used for purchases. Credit cards are still PITA in some parts of the world, accepting credit cards might also be PITA. Bitcoin allows one to clear transaction in matter of units, and it knows no borders.
But it is only superior when merchant and customer have some bitcoin reserves, i.e. customer doesn't need to buy bitcoins for this specific transaction, and merchant doesn't need to sell them immediately. Then overhead of selling/buying is spread over many transactions, and it can be very low per one transaction.
Bitcoin also enables unique businesses which could not exist otherwise... Say, internet stock exchanges. It allows people to buypass regulations and do things directly.

It's hard to say... You'll make those alt-bitcoins available to people who have bitcoin balance.
But to make them valuable you need _demand_ for that new currency, e.g. adoptions from the side of vendors.
Just having a lot of people with balances doesn't make currency more valuable...
This sort of happened with Devcoin. People get devcoins for writing articles for devtome.com. After they invited many new writers Devcoin price actually tanked because once these new writers got devcoins they just sold them on exchange for bitcoins. (Some people _were_surprised that this sort of adoption doesn't help,  I kid you not.)

Well, this article is talking about new money entering the Bitcoin market, i.e. institutional investors making a decision to buy Bitcoin.
If you want to calculate the effect on the Bitcoin price, you have to take into account that there are miners who already decided to increase the amount of bitcoins they hold.
So if you want to consider effect on price, you should either sum new money entering the market with old interest from miners, OR reduce amount of bitcoins mined by amount which will be held by miners. You have same result in both cases.

Well, it's possible. But I don't think that they would be able to emulate it perfectly, it's a bit too deep...

Something like this:
1. Buyer and seller create a transaction A which: 1) has two inputs: x BTC from seller, y BTC from buyer; 2) has one output: (x+y) BTC, script requires signatures of both seller and buyer.
2. This transaction is signed by both parties.
3. If all goes well, buyer creates a transaction B which spends output of transaction A and sends (x+z) BTC to seller and (y-z) BTC to buyer. He signs it and sends to seller.
4. Seller signs it too. Now this transaction is complete, and in the end seller receives (x+z) BTC, while buyer gets (y-z) BTC back.
Price of item is z. x is seller's stake (which he loses if he violates the contract), and (y-z) is buyers stake (which he loses if he doesn't pay to seller).
Frankly, I don't think it will work in game-theoretic sense.

Currently electricity costs are small compared to value of bitcoins produced by ASIC miners. But as difficulty increases, ratio of electricity costs to value of produced bitcoins will increase.
I think electricity costs are only significant for those who use 110+ nm devices. But soon they will become significant even for those who use more efficient 65nm and 28nm devices.
At this point those who aren't able to get cheap electricity will be out of business.
ASIC devices themselves will be commodity at that point: a lot of old devices will be available on the market, and new ones will be sold with razor-thin margin (that is, close to costs needed to manufacture them), as there are many competitors and at that point engineering costs will be paid off.
So the future will be in the hands of those who can build efficient mining facilities: they need cheap electricity, cooling, space etc.
If Bitcoin market cap becomes huge, people might build dedicated nuclear power plants. Of course, at that point they can order ASICs directly from foundries, but it is not as important as the rest.

OK, suppose we prioritize security over anything else. 
It is possible to run your app in an absolutely minimal environment, for example, directly on top of Linux kernel, or in some minimal installation of Free/Net/Open BSD. Then you have a computing environment which consists of just a handful of things:
1. BIOS
2. bootloader such as grub
3. Linux kernel (or something similar)
4. libc
5. Bitcoin app
We know that Linux kernel already has a code review process and it is hard to sneak a rootkit into it. Same thing libc. grub is small.
Bitcoin app is small too.
So in the end we can assume that all the code was reviewed by many people, we just need to piggyback on top of system which is code-reviewed by a larger audience.




This is true. User might keep his savings in an offline wallet, while online wallet is used for day-to-day purchases.

No, I'm referring to a model describe in this document: 
It is a generalization of
 * the initial [Colored Bitcoin]( spec by Yoni Assia and Lior Hakim
 * colored coins based on order-based coloring
 * [Smart Property]( concept described by Mike Hearn
 * [Distributed market]( concept described by Mike Hearn (later Jeff Garzik attempted to implement it, calling it pybond and, later, smartcoin)
 * Namecoin domain transfers
All these things are based on the same common principle:


between the movement of Bitcoins, and the movement of assets. In both cases we
want to assign assets to owners, and allow those owners to aprove the transfer
of their assets to new owners.

Sorry, but it looks like there is some confusion on this matter.
One of Kocherlakota's papers is called _Money is memory_, but he obviously does not mean that money is same as memory. His point is that money is used instead of memory, like some kind of memory surrogate. But memory is actually superior.
What is memory in this context?
It is a log of all economically-relevant actions of an agent, i.e. what he produced, consumed or transferred to other agent.
E.g. John has 5 apples, which he gives to Marry. Then he gets a banana from Paul. (Literally. Check third page of this paper: 
Of course, we do not record these things in Bitcoin blockchain, we only record transfers of Bitcoin, but not what is sold and bought for Bitcoin.
So no, Bitcoin isn't same as memory. It is memory in same sense that money is memory: it can be used as a substitute. But we already know that Bitcoin is money, so it's nothing new, right?
On the other hand, this might give us a hint about why Bitcoin works: blockchain is effectively a memory of all Bitcoin transactions... But we don't really need economic theory to understand how it works.
I think people misunderstand these two things. Memory about Bitcoin transactions isn't memory of economic activity, and former cannot really have significant economic effects.
On the other hand, our arch-rival Ripple is actually closer to memory... But not quite there.

If average transaction fee is 0.0001, we need 250k transactions per block (416 transactions per second) to get 25 BTC per block assuming no block rewards.
At this point one block will be 62 MB large, and blockchain will grow by 3.2 TB per year.
And people already complain that transaction fees are too damn high. If Bitcoin price grows tenfold and people will want to pay same amount of dollars in transaction fees, we need ten times more transactions. (I.e. 32 TB per year.)
Worse than that, we'll need to get to 125k transaction per block (assuming 0.0001 BTC per transaction) by 2016, otherwise miners will get twice less bitcoins than they get now, and if their profit margin is less than 50%, most of them will drop out. (And I bet profit margins will go down in 3 years due to fierce competition.)
In my opinion, this is a very bleak picture... I know a lot of people think that Satoshi is basically demigod and his invention is perfect, but "block reward halving" is a very dumb idea which ignores economics of mining.
It is possible to change reward smoothly, some alt-coins do it this way (see Sunny King's inventions, for example). I'm not saying those alt-coins are good, but it's definitely doable.
So, a bad thing can happen in 2016... What can we do to prevent it?
Frankly, I don't know, but there are some steps which can help to ameliorate the problem:
1. We should embrace the fact that transactions fees are high. Bitcoin itself is NOT micropayment-friendly. You gotta pay money to get your transaction processed by huge distributed network of nodes and stored forever. Services built on top of Bitcoin can offer micropayments and things like that. You do not need full power of Bitcoin network to pay for a cup of coffee.
2. Do something at the point when block reward is halved. For example, keep fees relatively small before that point, and at the point of having increase both fees and block size. This way there won't be a shock for miners. (But there will be a shock for users.)
Why didn't this problem happen in 2012? Well, it was a coincidence that ASIC mining devices appeared right after that. But we won't have super-ASICs in 2016.

It is high-risk in the sense that if you only have Bitcoin you can lose everything.
But if you diversify your portfolio by adding Bitcoin to it, it might actually reduce your overall risk since correlation between value of Bitcoin and value of other assets is small or even negative.
E.g. suppose there is USD inflation... What happens to Bitcoin? It probably grows.
Stock market crashes... What happens to Bitcoin? I don't see why it would crash too.
Some country dumps its gold reserves? I doubt they have Bitcoin reserves to dump as well.
So, say, if you keep Bitcoin investment a small fraction of your portfolio, it, likely, decreases your risks

 You have to trust SSL certificates.
Sort of...
One needs to authenticate escrow agent (AKA _dispute mediation service_) since one needs to trust escrow agent he uses, otherwise it is pointless.
But it isn't necessary for a customer to authenticate a merchant if merchant was authenticated by escrow agent he trusts.
For example, suppose I'm buying via bitmit.net. I don't need to request any kind of certificate from user I'm buying from because bitmit.net already takes care of this.
This considerably relaxes the requirements. Escrow agents will need to buy SSL certificates, or their certificate might be bundled with client, or it might be installed into client by user.
But I don't need a certificate for each individual merchant. This means that merchants can stay reasonably anonymous, use web-of-trust or any reputation system, etc...

As people say, it buying bitcoins isn't hard... but selling fiat money is.
Credit cards and PayPal accounts get stolen all the time, but we don't hear about it very often because it is not a big deal: usually, the stolen money is returned. Banks are able to to this because they can trace and reverse payments.
Thus, a thief can't just send money to his account... that would make no sense.
Buying bitcoins with stolen money is the best option. Imagine there was a service which would let one to buy bitcoins with PayPal with no extra verification.  This would allow an attacker to write a bot which would automatically buy bitcoins using money on hacked PayPal accounts.
And so, as you can imagine, credit card and payment companies either outright forbid or impose severe restrictions on services like that.

The difference is in performance: to resolve name using namecoin you need to scan namecoin blockchain, which is potentially large.
To check name using "this idea" you just need to check merkle tree and correctness of block header, potentially it involves small amounts of information, and it is something thin clients need to do anyway.
In terms of software complexity, thin clients need to be able to check block headers and check transaction validity via merkle tree anyway, so extra complexity is rather small.
Well, one could say that working with bitcoin and namecoin blockchains is easy because most code is reused, so it's relative...
I just think it's easier to work with one blockchain.

Well, majority of miners can set up fee policy for everybody. Say, 0.1% of value being sent. Or flat fee 0.0005 BTC.
And then all transactions must include this fee, otherwise they won't get it into block.
There is no risk for majority of miners until it ceases to be majority. If somebody tries to go against this policy his mining will simply be lost in vain.
Now consider a different scenario where there is no collusion among miners. In that case there is a competition. If miners recommend paying 0.0005 BTC you can still try to send it with 0.0001 BTC fee, and some rebel miner will include it into block. So, basically, there is a tremendous competitive pressure to make fees as low as possible.
But is it a good thing? Don't forget you have as much security as you pay for. If fees are low it is simply non-profitable to maintain large mining farms.
Let's go through this again:
1. For a collective of miners, it makes sense to have some reasonable minimal fee.
2. For an individual miner, it makes sense to accept transactions even if they have very small fees because processing costs are low.
3. If one miner does that, other miners will have to, basically. (If they are rational.)
4. Fees are low in general.
5. Low fees support much less hashing power.
6. Which makes network less secure.
So without "gentlemen's agreement" network is less secure.
Also with very low fees microtransactions are viable, which means that blockchain bloat might be like 10x higher, which means that barrier to entry is higher for miners (they need to download whole blockchain, you know), which again means less secure network.
Right now we have 0.0005 BTC fee gentlemen's agreement without collusion, but right now fees are nearly irrelevant and rules are set by dev team who simply set it to avoid spam.
When fees will matter things will change, it would actually make sense to accept low fees.


We have some sort of prisoner's dilemma like thing here. Suppose all miners have high fees and one miner has low fees. He will mine a large block with lots of transactions and thus will collect more fees than other miners.
Do you think that miners will have moral integrity to maintain high fees? This is simply not rational, individually.
High fees can be maintained either due to collusion, or because of altruistic behaviour.
Basically, you consider this problem as a human, I consider it is a game-theoretic problem, mathematically.
Maybe I'm wrong and game-theoretic rationality isn't applicable here. My reasoning is based on the fact that mining is profit-driven enterprise.

Greg Maxwell, right? He's been the most vocal Ethereum opponent on Bitcoin forums.
He's not infallible. MM sidechains which he and his buddies were pushing were a huge fiasco, as [predictably]( there's no way to make them secure.
He's also likely on the losing side of proof-of-stake debate. People who are involved in academic research are quite positive about PoS.


They can make plausible arguments, indeed. To understand where they are wrong you need to go beyond those arguments and see a bigger picture.
For example, Maxwell and Poelstra describe some global conspiracy kind of a situation in which PoS fails. PoW is not going to be affected by _that_ specific scenario, but PoW can fail in scenarios which are much more likely and practically plausible.
Thus to see a weakness in Poelstra's arguments against PoS you need to go beyond what they're saying and analyze the alternatives by yourself.
Maxwell used the very same tactic when I outlined problems with mined sidechains -- he [wrote]( that Bitcoin itself is not very secure.
So what I'm saying is that listening only people who have decided to stick to Bitcoin isn't very wise, as such people won't give you the whole picture with all nuances.


I'm not a big ETH proponent, actually. There are many problems with Ethereum: developers are somewhat reckless, it's not stable and is going to go through many chances, we don't know if it's going to survive. Ethereum's model is also far from perfect: it's very hard to make dapps secure.
But I see a lot of interesting things in Ethereum. Let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater...
(Also the above implies that you do not hold Sergio Demian Lerner in high regard, LOL.)


In that case they are no longer trustless. Another major issue is that if you have a contract with a lot of people involved, you need a lot of signatures, and a lot of people being present online. It might work well in theory, but in practice it might turn out that a lot of people are offline or lost their keys or are no longer interested. Ethereum model is much more practical in this respect.
Let's consider a simple example: a lottery. Many people put money into a pool, then one of them is chosen, and he can withdraw money. In Ethereum this is no-brainer. Now try to implement it on top of Bitcoin. You'll see that it's orders of magnitude less efficient, and harder to implement -- if possible at all.
Of course, this isn't about lotteries, there is a large class of use cases which follow the same pattern -- Ponzi schemes, DAOs, insurance, savings, etc. The problem with Bitcoin model is that different UTXOs cannot have a shared state. I don't think that shared state creates and practical or conceptual problems (if it's used only for things which absolutely need it), it's just something Bitcoin lacks.
(And, BTW, as you mentioned Truthcoin, I developed a prediction market design which is simpler and better. And, guess what, it can be implemented within an Ethereum smart contract quite easily, and it follows the aforementioned pattern, so implementing it on top of Bitcoin would be a bitch, to put it lightly.)


Meh, I think Satoshi only had very rough intuitive understanding of it, and we still have that exact design, Bitcoin's fundamental model was never changed.
What this shows is that cryptocurrencies are more robust than we think. There are many theoretical attacks against Bitcoin like selfish mining and feather forks, but in practice they do not matter. 
Bitcoin mining switched to pooled mining model. It was unplanned and uncoordinated, yet Bitcoin works just fine.
With other cryptocurrencies it's kinda the same: most of the are doing quite well as long as there is some interest in them. There are ones with theoretically broken PoS schemes, but they are working well in practice. Many alt-coins went through hard forks and yet are doing fine.
I agree that cryptoeconomics is very complex and we still know very little about it, but Bitcoin isn't hard. Its success is the result of the original highly robust design, not a result of a thorough research.

It doesn't work this way: US Treasury default doesn't lead to US dollar collapse or anything like that.
US Treasury is completely separate from The Fed. US dollars are being controlled by The Fed.
What happens if Treasury is unable to pay interest on debt? Well, no one knows for sure, but it won't have direct effect on US dollar.
But we know that many things can and will happen, and that might have impact on US dollar.
That said, it is possible for US government (Congress) to destroy value of US dollar, but it isn't an easy feat. Actually, The Fed have been trying to do this for years, this is what QE is about. But it barely works.

Look, I love Bitcoin, but national currencies are more decentralized than Bitcoin.
Sure, plenty of nodes run Bitcoin code, but they run exactly same code, controlled by a small group of people.
Yes, there are independent implementations, but Mike Hearn (one of core developers) told us that using them is risky.
So BItcoin is less decentralized than you think. Compare this to 100+ countries each having its own currency and own monetary policy.
Bitcoin is nice for international settlements, but "let's all just switch to Bitcoin" is a crazy talk.
Don't forget that Bitcoin network is simply unable to process more than 7 transactions per second. (Block limit.)
If block limit will be raised, blockchain will grow much faster, which means only high-end servers will be able to verify transactions.

A concept of blockchain which has native support for colored coins is called ripplecoin. (Not same thing as Ripple at all.)
Cross-blockchain trade can be done via a contract, but it isn't 100% reliable.

To make it clear, I meant use of m-of-n mutlisignature script for escrow or dispute mediation.
What overhead are we talking about? If there is no dispute then it is just a payment with no overhead at all, no third party is involved.
If there is a dispute, we need to consider incentives different parties have. 
If it is 2-of-2 mutlisig (i.e. both sellers and buyers signatures are required to release money), buyer cannot get money back without seller's consent, so he will withhold his signature only if he wants to punish seller. We can some extra so that punishing seller won't be free for buyer. E.g.
Goods cost 10 BTC. Buyer sends 11 BTC to escrow. If all is well, he signs tx which sends 10 BTC to seller and 1 BTC back to him.
If there is a problem and seller isn't a dick, 11 BTC go back to buyer.
If there is a problem and seller is a dick, they need to talk... In worst case 11 BTC is locked there forever. But seller gets nothing out of it.
Another option is to use 2-of-3 multisig and use dispute mediation service. If there is no problem then seller and buyer unlock payment themselves.
If there is a problem they go to dispute mediator. Dispute mediator might take, say, 5% of money to consider the case, and side either with seller or with buyer. So overhead exists only if there is a problem.
Seller and buyer need to agree on use of specific mediator. Of course, mediator care a lot about their reputation so it isn't in their interest make wrong judgments. 
It doesn't apply to PayPal because PayPal is monopolist, but in this case we'll have a free market for mediation, there is no barrier to entry to shitty mediators will be quickly weeded out.

Size of Merkle branch is on scale of log2 N if N is a number of transactions in block. If there are 4000 transactions in block (that's the maximum number of normal transactions within 1 MB block size limit), you need to download about 32*12 =384 bytes to get a proof that a transaction is in a certain block.
Also you need all block headers to make sure that that block is in the main chain.

Krugman's paper I've linked above demonstrates that if yields on US bonds will increase, it will actually help to do that the Fed is trying to do: i.e. it will actually boost USA's economy. (But see above: workers might get relatively poorer.)
So USA will have a chance.
But it is very well possible that it won't use this chance, and then, yes, hyperinflation is possible.
The thing is, you'll get a warning. Hyperinflation doesn't happen overnight, it happens when economy is ruined and government is grasping at straws.
Now may I ask you, what kind of macroeconomic models are familiar with? Can you show where Krugman is wrong?

If buyer uses a credit card to pay via PayPal, he can do chargeback, and PayPal either has to suffer loss or to inflict that loss to merchant.

You can do that securely with so-called atomic coin swapping. (It works pretty much like this escrow, but is more straightforward and secure.)
The problem with two-party mixing is that it is very inefficient. You never know who is that other guy, what if he is an NSA bot and you have just made your coins more traceable instead of making them less traceable?

You got wrong impression from what happened Litecoin.
Dude who designed scrypt to be used in Tenebrix (and, later, Litecoin) didn't just want to make it GPU-hostile, he wanted to make it possible to run mining with minimum overhead, i.e. so that you can use a couple of cores for mining and the rest to do something useful.
To do that, he set scrypt memory parameter to 128 KiB: this fits into CPU's L2 cache (or even L1 cache), so that no memory bandwidth is used.
Interestingly, it is the same person who made the very first GPU miner for Bitcoin, so he knew a bit or two about GPUs, and he was confident that it is impossible to make GPU miner for this Tenebrix.
But he was wrong: somebody found a trick which made it possible to mine 128 KiB scrypt on GPU efficiently.
People got impression that GPU mining was matter of time, but in reality the problem was ArtForz's vanity: parameters he have chosen for scrypt were not conservative enough. He could not imagine somebody can find a trick he couldn't.
It's obvious that CPU-only hashing algo can be constructed. Say, scrypt which would use 512 MiB of memory. Dual core CPU will use two threads because that's how many cores it has.  GPU will use two threads because it has only 1 GB of RAM.
Or with 10 MiB buffer, it's too large for cache so both  CPU and GPU will bottleneck on memory performance.

People will be able to notice that something is fishy, but it is hard to tell what is going on exactly without special tools. (Not to mention an average miner is simply not familiar with a concept of fork, he only knows how to plug it into an USB port.)
Basically, (depending on how double-spend is organized) it is hard to determine that BTC Guild is malicious, it can as well be explained with technical problem of some sort (i.e. a bug in bitcoind caused a fork) or connectivity issues.
If attacker controls two (or more) biggest pools, he can make it more realistic by mining two chains in parallel. Lack of convergence can be explained with bad luck or connectivity issues.
To make connectivity issues more plausible (and attack easier) it makes sense to do a DDoS attack on pools and nodes not controlled by attacker.
So it can look like this:
1. Massive DDoS attack on nodes and pools.
2. Several pools (which are controlled by attack) are relatively accessible, so miners flock to them.
3. Weird things happen with blockchain, like a reorg after each block.
4. This culminates with 6-deep reorg.
5. Attack announces that he successfully pwned the Bitcoin network, demonstrates a successful double-spend against 6 confirmations.
6. Bitcoin price plummets, attackers gain a lot on financial bets they made beforehands

Well, you first need to decide how to handle trade. There are [several]( options available. And only then to decide on particular tech, i.e. use of Electrum or something else.
FYI I am the lead dev of colored coins project.... We did consider making a Electrum-based client, but for now we are going to focus on JS-based one, which would work like blockchain.info wallet.
We might reconsider this choice if there are reasons for that. For example: support from existing Electrum developers, demand from users.


It is fairly easy to implement exchange based on colored coins because they can be exchange via atomic coin swap transactions which are secure and fairly straightforward.
Trading alts would require a client which can handle two or more chains at once, and use of fairly advanced contracts... Which are currently discouraged by Bitcoin network.
As for Ripple IOUs, you'll have problems bridging them with Bitcoin network... I don't know a good way to handle this... Unless you represent IOUs in Bitcoin network, which means colored coins, again.

This is only 2^32 times less than 2^128. Margin isn't that large...
There might be some weakness in ECDSA. We might find some way to attack many keys at once. One person can get more than one attacking chips...

This is shame, now that we have Bitcoin Foundation, is it really necessary to use third-party file hosting?
It is absolutely crucial to make sure that users get genuine copies of the flagship Bitcoin software (Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind).
So it MUST be served over HTTPS directly from server controlled only by core developers team.
With modern network speeds it is no longer necessary to use multiple mirrors, CDNs, etc. A server with gigabit connection can serve hundreds of thousands of downloads per day.
If that it is not enough and there is overwhelming demand, it makes more sense to distributed it using BitTorrent protocol than to use CDN: BitTorrent verifies content integrity via hashes. So unless BitTorrent software is broken, user is guaranteed to get correct version of software.
While with CDN you have to depend on security of hundreds of servers all over the word... If one of these servers will be overtaken by attackers, it can be very damaging to Bitcoin reputation.

Oh, by the way, so you say attacker will have no problem monitoring state of the whole network. Not only learning about the split, but even finding miners and nodes on sides of the split.
But can't larger merchants and payment processors do the same? If they monitor whole network they can quickly detect abnormality and delay confirmation. Confirmation time isn't deterministic anyway, so extra delay shouldn't be a problem.
Perhaps they would outsource monitoring to a company like blockchain.info. They don't need to trust their money to that company, they only need a warning in case of a problem.
And smaller merchants probably shouldn't bother. It isn't like people will use network split to buy themselves a free cake or something like that.

But this approach has many drawbacks: SPV doesn't work (so no thin clients), no soft forks, etc.

This arbitrary data was disguised as if it was data which is necessary to verify transactions.
I'll give you a simple example. Suppose I will encode letter A as 0.00000001, letter B as 0.00000002 and so on.
I can encode any word by sending such small accounts to some address. E.g. I might send them to your address as a message to you. "A T T A C K AT D A W N".
This encoding scheme is not efficient, though. It is a better idea to encode arbitrary data in Bitcoin addresses. E.g. you're telling the network "To spend these coins, one needs to sign transaction with a private key corresponding to public key "ATTACK AT DAWN"". Normally public key looks like some random garbage, but not in this case.
Furthermore, there is a Bitcoin feature which allows one to specify multiple public keys, e,g. "one of these 10 keys can be used to sign transactions: 1) "ATTACK". 2) "AT" 3) "DAWN"...."
Here is transaction in question:

Essentially bankers can control what kind of businesses are allowed and what aren't.
It isn't about financial risks: bank are exposed to financial risks only when they need to provide credit, and it isn't the case here.
I understand that banks are afraid that regulators might retaliate if they enable Bitcoin business operation, but it's a very shitty situation if fear can stifle innovation.
Also I wonder, isn't there some kind of standard procedure where a bank can ask a government agency "Can we do business with company XYZ?" and government agency says either YES or NO. If government explicitly allowed it, it should absolve bank of the responsibility.
It seriously doubt that it is a catch-22-like situation. More likely banks use "uncertainty" as an excuse.

I guess you assume that the Bitcoin Satoshi have created was perfect, but it isn't the case: while protocol's core still works fine, there were several serious bugs and a lot of weird things which later were disabled.
E.g. transaction replacement implementation: it is relatively complex, weird, non-reliable (nodes can freely ignore it, so it is 100% honor-based) and, likely, completely unnecessary. It was disabled early on.
The initial pay-to-ip-address payment method was weird and broken, eventually it was disabled.
And so on... I think it is safe to say that Satoshi was lucky that mistakes he made had no long-term detrimental effect.
As for complexity, Bitcoin is in fact simpler than most e-cash designs... I'd say that the main invention behind Bitcoin is that something _this_ simple can work.

Many would disagree, but Bitcoin is not designed for instant transactions.
Bitcoin can be used in such cases, but they are not what it is designed for.
So do not focus much on these things. Transactions over internet is a huge thing, and for in-person purchases you can just use a credit card, perhaps a credit card refilled with Bitcoins.
You do not even need to hold fiat money, you just incur USD-denominated debt and then pay it off with Bitcoins.
Yes, credit card companies get some fees, but they are responsible for all the infrastructure, so you don't need internet to make a purchase. There is some value to this, no?
Sure, some people report successful  point-of-sale or person-to-person transactions with Bitcoin, it is cool. But it is not cool when people complain that there is a difficulty of some sort when it isn't advertised as a working feature.
Absolutely anything computer-related can get broken, and often has bugs. When you do transactions over internet you can wait or use another system. When you do it in person, you'll be wasting time and get nervous.

There are different ways to implement it.
@_date: 2013-10-27 08:47:30
Basically, if attacker has full control over your computer (and usually virus/trojan/keylogger means that potentially he has full control), he can do pretty much everything.
For example, you want to withdraw to your address, attacker will replace it with his address. You will authorize withdrawal request via 2FA, thinking that money goes to your address.
The only way to prevent this is to verify and authorize each request on a clean system.
Basically, if the question is "Do you authorize mtgox withdrawal?", then attacker can easily pwn you. (By "easily" I mean it can be done with ease, but most of attackers are too lazy to do that, this is why 2FA "works".)
If the question is "Do you authorize withdrawal of 50 BTC to address 1XYZ...?" and you actually check the address before taping  "yes", then it is as secure as device which is use for authentication.
And if you connect your phone to your infected computer, it might be infected as well...
So, all in all, it just makes more sense to get a separate netbook for Bitcoin stuff. It takes like 10 minutes to install Linux. Disable Flash, Java, JS script in browser, don't use it to browser porn... And it is better than shoddy half-assed schemes like 2FA.

1. There are companies which accept it as currency. E.g. 
2. It has many devout fans, and they're pushing hard to increase acceptance.
3. It can be used as a "back-up currency" of sorts: it is unlikely that some problem will affect Bitcoin and Litecoin at the same time, so some Bitcoin people diversify into Litecoin.
4. On tech side, 2.5 minute confirmations are nice, and also Litecoin dev team is more willing to experiment (but so far they implemented approximately nothing).

Well, to spend money you need to enter private key or seed into client. If there is malware on your computer, it will see this private key, and thus attacker will be able to spend the rest of the money.
On the other hand, if you have 10 independent paper wallets, you will never expose the whole sum (unless you need to spend the whole sum).
E.g. suppose you own 1000 BTC, and need to spend 100 BTC ASAP. If there is malware on the computer you're using, you can lose up to 1000 BTC with one paper wallet, but only 100 BTC if you have 10 of them.
You can never be sure that your computer is 100% secure, so it is better to compartmentalize the damage if possible.
Besides that, full public key is exposed to ECDSA attacks after you made a transaction...  Currently there are no feasible attacks against ECDSA (if signing software is implemented correctly), but they might appear in future, in that case addresses which were never used to _send_ transactions will be still intact.
However, we already witnesses an attack on ECDSA private key via buggy signing software: due to a bug in Android, signature didn't use random number, so attacker could get private key and steal coins.
Sure, it is a problem with buggy software. But if wallet used address only once, users won't have lost their coins.

I would not call them malicious, those are just rational miners. You know, game-theoretically-rational.


Yeah, but if everybody is rational it isn't that much risky...
If everybody is rational, the right strategy is to pay a part of that exorbitant fee as a kickback to next miner (via OP_TRUE transaction output which can be claimed by the next miner).
E.g. you get 40 BTC for yourself and send 40 BTC to OP_TRUE. (I don't remember exact number.)
Then if you're lucky to find next block, other miners will have an incentive to build on top of it and grab 40 BTC rather than built on top of previous block and

Sure. Bitcoin beats traditional investment opportunities by a very large margin, and it can be exciting.
However, I believe it's different for poor folk, because poor folk isn't yet used to a concept that their net worth can fluctuate wildly, and the fact they have a chance to get financially independent this way is as exciting as winning the lottery is.

Cashing out bitcoins is definitely NOT the point of this gift... The point is that for an average person it is hard to obtain any amount of bitcoins, so getting a gift from somebody who already owns them is the easiest way.
Perhaps this guy's presentation was wrong...
But the point is, if somebody received a paper wallet with $10 worth of bitcoins a year ago and kept it, he would have $700 worth of bitcoins now.

Maybe. Some time after attack happens. Damage is already done at that point.


You could use same kind of argument to explain why banking system is safe: bankers do not want to damage value of banks they are profiting from. But we all know how it works...
This is a very weak argument. People are not always rational, but even if they are, they still might choose decisions which are bad in the long term, if they think others might ruin it anyway. See Prisoner's dilemma...
When miners were acting independently you could assume that majority of nodes are super-rational, and so optimal super-rational decision is to follow protocol.
But when hashpower is clustered, you cannot assume this, majority might end up Byzantine (i.e. outright malicious), and so rational miner will try to maximize profit, selling hashrate to highest bidder and selling coins as soon as it gets them...
Some pools offer payoff in fiat currency, further removing barriers for a miner to be cutthroat-rational.
Thus essentially we depend on altruism. Then why exactly is Bitcoin safer than banking system?

One one Bitcoin's main functions and advantages is store of value: you can just keep Bitcoins in your wallet, without depending on anyone; and it is as secure as you make it.
And here you recommend to send Bitcoins to someone for a _promise_ to return more. How does it make any sense?
There is a reason why people offer to "invest" in Bitcoin, specifically: these ventures are incredibly risky and 100% unregulated.
People, please do not fall for it. Do not "invest" more than you're willing to lose for shits and giggles.
Even if investment isn't a scam, a lot of people get burned because they cannot do the math, particularly:
1. PMBs (perpetual mining bonds) pay good dividend now, but people are missing that difficulty is increasing so fast that total dividends they'll ever get from it are lower than PMB's price. Please check [geometric series]( if dividend is exponentially decreasing, sum is finite. (And is easy to calculate.)
2. Example: BASIC-MINING's market capitalization (i.e. current market value of all shares) is almost 10x higher than value of its assets... People believe that if manager is good, he will be able to increase hashrate as difficulty increases indefinitely.

The problem with Bitcoin:
1. When you buy Bitcoins from Coinbase, it knows your identity, as that is necessary to do an US dollar payment.
2. Then you transfer Bitcoins to your wallet.
3. And buy drugs with them.
4. If drug seller was actually a honeypot, they see your transaction, and can trace coins back to Coinbase purchase.
5. At that point they can ask Coinbase about identity of person who bought those coins, and thus find that you bought illegal substance.
You can think that Bitcoins are quite like coins which are transferred between parties, and transaction is a record of transfer from party to party. Since all transactions are publicly visible (this is necessary to avoid cheating) it is always possible to go through chain.
Zerocoin transactions work in different way. Basically there are two kind of transactions: one puts Bitcoin into a pile, and another withdraws it from a pile.
But the thing is, it is organized in such a way that
1. only a person who put something in can withdraw
2. but it is not possible to connect withdraw to any particular previous transaction
How does it work? Well, it is based on very complex cryptographic constructs very few people can understand... And we don't even know if it is secure as cyptographic constructs it uses are fairly obscure and not well tested.
So it will take a while for it to get into Bitcoin mainline, if ever...
However, there is another approach which requires no changes to Bitcoin protocol: mixing. Mixing can provide same (or similar) benefits, but relies only on well-understood crypto constructs, and doesn't require any protocol changes, so it can be implemented right now
@_date: 2013-06-26 22:12:56
People say it is enough to go from 128 KiB (used in Litecoin) to 256 KiB.
Person who first introduced scrypt mining (ArtForz) thought that 128 KiB is enough to make GPU mining not feasible. But later people found that it is possible to do it with some clever optimization. (To be honest, I didn't bother to check which exactly.) Same optimization won't work if you have 256 KiB to process.

It is possible to implement all major Ripple's features (i.e. issuance of  IOUs and private currencies) on top of Bitcoin blockchain, for example, via "colored coins".
This makes Ripple and Bitcoin direct competitors: if feature-wise they will be comparable, it's main difference is mining and lack of thereof.

Oh, actually I once made a sketch of a decentralized pegged currency based on colored coins, as a response to Mastercoin stabilization mechanism. (Old version of Mastercoin spec had a different solution based on derivatives, not on a dumb escrow fund.)

In reality, coffers of such investors are finite, so it will, likely, fail at some point.

I haven't had a chance to explore protocol in detail yet, but from what I've heard it is quite comparable to Bitcoin: it is also based on distributed consensus and rules...
The difference is in what is used for synchronization: Bitcoin uses proof-of-work, while Ripple uses consensus among well-known parties.
It is hard to say that the later is inferior: don't forget that overwhelming majority of Bitcoin hashing power belongs to top 5 mining pools.
So effectively Bitcoin network synchronization is also run by small number of well-known parties.
(You could say that "miners" who own mining hardware will switch to different mining pools if they see any nefarious behavior... But same is true for Ripple: users can switch to a different list of trusted parties. In fact in Ripple it is more democratic and more explicit, since in theory people have choice, not just dudes with ASICs.)
Other difference is that Ripple uses list of account balances instead of list of transactions.
So, yes, Ripple is a cryptocurrency.
You can say it is a somewhat shoddy one since we haven't got all the code yet.

Oh, I'd give you mine, but there is a problem with site now.
I do not recommend pyramining though. Currently breakeven (for old infrastructure) is 3 years, and it will increase as Bitcoin difficulty increases.
At the same time, they haven't started ASIC mining yet. But hopefully they are a bit more legit than other companies since they were around for a while.
The problem with pyramining is that your profit is only 10% of the deposit if you haven't invited anybody. So it makes more sense as a pyramid.
However, fixed-hashrate mining bonds seem to be a bad thing in general: difficulty increases, their value drops faster than you earn money.

* 200 BTC is a total for two projects (NGCCC and WebcoinX), each of this projects has multiple milestones (stages of implementations, sub-projects, etc.) So I can use, say, 30 BTC per milestone. This isn't enough even to hire 1 programmer for a month in US.

Mainstream economists would tell you that it makes more sense to keep generation going pretty much forever. Say, make monetary base inflation 1% per year. It is so low that it's barely noticeable, but it prevents deflation and concentration of money in hands of few.
But, of course, a limit on monetary base looks really attractive for people who want to speculate on it: cake is finite, so you want a piece of it.

I think you got it wrong.  Here's a direct quote: 






Well, you simply need some means of communication between parties who use these contracts.
Currently, to pay somebody you need to copy-paste his address (or use Bitcoin URL), this process is so easy we barely notice it.
But smart contracts usually require several steps, so we need communication channel between clients for usability reasons.
Something like IRC channel would suffice. Or, if merchant already has a web site, it makes sense to use HTTP, e.g. some simple REST API.
Of course, it is possible to use a P2P network for communications, but it isn't necessary. Particularly, I don't think it makes sense to add a messaging feature to Bitcoin network because Bitcoin network is very important: we don't want people to be able to flood it with their messages, that would be very wasteful.
So from practical perspective it is OK to use IRC or simple web messaging. But people who implement Bitcoin clients would want to use something P2P based for the sake of decentralization.
Anyway, when were implementing contracts for trading colored coins (transferable virtual property), we create a simple web service which allows 'chat' between clients. This way they can discover people who want to trade and then exchange incompletely signed transactions until they both sign a transaction which does the trade.
But it was my decision to implement it this way, pretty much everybody I talked with said that it isn't decentralized enough.

Depends on a kind of a contract. If participants have an incentive to not put garbage in, then it's not a problem.
Sometimes they just can't. A simple example is a pyramid contract: you put money in and wait. There is absolutely no way to cheat if the contract is trustless. The system doesn't accept inputs except deposits.
While gambling contracts are considered 'useless', they are closely related to derivative contract. E.g. you can make a savings contract which rewards people who withdraw as late as possible at expense of early withdrawers.
Then you can make a mining difficulty derivatives: data about mining should be available to the contract, and it cannot be faked as long as the chain is valid.
If you have a decentralized market within the system, you can make trustless derivative contracts which refer to token prices.
And so on...
It's funny how bitcoiners only consider contracts which Bitcoin can do with multi-sig.

You pick, for example, 100 nodes at random, and send transaction A to 50 of them and transaction B to other 50 of them.
What is the probability of an event that merchant will get transaction A while the miner-who-will-mine-the-next-block will get B?

I am currently working on p2p cryptocurrency exchange for Bitcoin, in context of 'colored coin' project. Colored coins are used to represent ownership of things which aren't Bitcoin, they are basically like IOUs which exist in Ripple. And then p2p exchange exists as a separate layer. Double-spending problem is solved on Bitcoin layer, so exchange can be rather primitive.
We already have a working proof-of-concept which allows people to trade with each other securely. But it relies on a centralized order book service. (Frankly, I don't see it being a big problem because anybody can run such order book service.)
I'm currently working on a web-based client.
Going back to Bitcoin+colored coins vs. Ripple comparison, in colored coin model BTC will have roughly same role as XRP: 
 * It is a currency which is normally used to pay transaction fees
 * It is a currency ownership of which carries no counter-party risks, i.e. it isn't based on IOUs
So I believe comparison is valid...
This isn't the only possible approach, though. One can also try to combine Bitcoin with off-chain transactions, using Bitcoin for settlements and whatnot.
In any case... Don't forget that OpenCoin's business plan is to make XRP valuable. So, yes, for them it is largely about currency, exchange is just the main use for that currency. This makes Ripple a Bitcoin competitor.
If people will see how Ripple's exchange and payment system works well, and XRP being a scarce resource, they will ask: Why bother with Bitcoin, mtgox and shit like that when Ripple is so much better?
People already buy XRP as an investment, don't be stupid.

Absolutely not the same. If you have currency, you can directly approach buyers. It would take considerable time until your activity will affect prices.
If you have commodity (e.g. gold), you need to convert it to currency first, and market will notice it pretty much instantly.
In other words, different amounts of liquidity is available. Currency has highest liquidity.


Somebody who isn't 12 would know that he can't get a piece of gold and go buy things.


It will. Again, this is the difference: effect isn't immediate, because it doesn't go through one market. Economy as a whole absorbs that money.
A good example is quantitative easing. Before all the bailout USA monetary base was $0.8T. Now it is $2.8T. Still inflation is barely noticeable, it doesn't exceed historic levels when no money was injected. (If you don't know how it works, The Fed bought ~$2T worth of securities on market.)
US government tries to inject money into economy for quite some time, hoping that prices will go up, but they don't.


Yes. That's why difference between commodity and currency matters: with commodity one needs to go through exchange with finite depth of market.

No, regular clients won't recognize them as normal addresses. Say, currently we use something like this:


But I hope they'll be more compact in future.
(This address still encodes public key hash, of course, but it needs to be encoded in a certain format to be recognizable by client. All in all, you can break it intentionally, but it cannot happen if you use client normally. You know just like you cannot accidentally send Bitcoins to a Litecoin address even if both Bitcoin and Litecoin use same public key hashes. This just doesn't happen.)
@_date: 2013-05-05 12:44:58
Meh.  Here's an explanation which is _much_ closer to reality, but still understandable for kids:
Kids in school decided to issue their own money. Instead of making coins or paper money which can get lost or destroyed, they simply decided to write it in a book.
For example, when Alice wants to transfer coins to Bob, she will add a record "I, Alice transfer 50 of my coins to Bob" and will sign it. She has a pen with a special ink so that anybody can see that it is indeed Alice's signature and nobody can fake it.
Anybody can calculate how much money Bob owns: they just read book from start, add what Bob receives and subtract what he pays.
There was a problem with kids paying more coins than they own, so they added a rule: transfer is only valid when somebody will put a stamp on it. Before stamping, that person would calculate whether all transactions are valid. For his work, he will receive some amount of money out of nowhere, i.e. "Carol is rewarded 50 coins for verifying". Stamp needs  to be made with a special sparkling ink which is expensive and hard to get, this prevents abuse. If you miscalculate and put your stamp on a transaction which isn't valid, people will eventually will find it out and remove this page from the book, but you already wasted that expensive glowing ink, so you better be accurate.
You can even get a bunch of kids and demonstrate how it works in practice.
A lot of people in ELI5 subreddit have problems understanding what Bitcoin actually is. Like, is it a number? I saw an otherwise well-informed poster who thought that it is like a special kind of a number which needs to be mined.
An analogy with piggy bank does not help to understand what Bitcoin physically is
@_date: 2013-06-14 14:25:23
There is no such thing as address balance on Bitcoin protocol level, it deals with 'transaction outputs', FTA:


So, well, to work with colored coins you use a special client which will keep outputs with different colors separate, and won't mix them when you send them etc.

Well, when people put money into the bank they say that they have money in a bank. But in fact bank just owes them money.
If you count together money which depositor has on account (10 BTC) and money lent out (9 BTC), that would be 19 BTC together... _This is why people say that banks create money_.
All those people who claim that banks can lend more money than they got simply do not understand it correctly: they watched certain video on youtube ("money as debt") which had some confusing explanation and got it wrong. Do not listen to them.

Well... You have read  right?


Not really. You just need to send smart property coin and payment in one transaction. Seller and buyer provide pieces of transaction, then when they see it is right they both sign it.
It is known as 'atomic coin swapping'. It can be seen as a simple form of smart contract.
But I don't know why you would call it escrow...


Well, this is promising: 
@_date: 2013-02-06 07:45:22
Same might be true for Bitcoin.
Say, somebody can use leverage on Bitcoinica to sell much more coins than he could otherwise, thus affecting spot price on MtGox. IIRC this actually happened a couple of times.
Capital markets can also increase apparent abundance of Bitcoin. E.g. suppose some investor dude was just keeping 1000 BTC in his wallet, but then he bought 1000 BTC worth of bonds of some company, and this company spent 1000 BTC on some goods it needs for development.
But if there was no financial market funds would sit idle and trade would not happen. So short-term effect is same as if additional 1000 BTC was created. 
Well, alternatively you can think that financial markets increase velocity of money, effect is the same: increasing velocity increases prices. See here: 
So, basically, you have higher demand for goods than you could have otherwise, so that pushes prices up according to supply &amp; demand theory.
So you get same effects as with fiat money, it's just that nobody collects money supply statistics. But money supply data isn't all you need to calculate inflation, the rest of factors are captured by a notion of velocity, and velocity definitely does exist for Bitcoin.

Are you saying that businesses should operate as if banks can fail at any time? This is outright ridiculous.


The fundamental problem was that country could not cover all losses incurred by banks. If everybody was a smartass and split their money among many banks... Well, they would simply lower payouts, since such rearrangement does not increase total amount of money available for payouts.
Yes, one could avoid losses by being smarter than average, but everybody cannot be smarter than average by definition, so it is not a solution to the systemic problem.


1. That company in Cyprus was more like a small company.
2. My sister works as an accountant in a mid-sized company (1000+ employees), and from what I gather they use just one bank. If anything, just because using many banks would be a PITA.
3. I've heard the same about other large companies...


USA is in an unique position: all debt is USD-denominated, and it can create as many USD as needed... However, Cyprus cannot print more Euro.
Russia actually tried covering USD-denominated debt with RUR-denominated loans, it didn't work so well and it defaulted in 1998.
Even in USA, while theory says it cannot default, in practice we see a lot of debate even if sum was relatively small...
So no, I don't think that any country can just swallow failure of large bank without consequences... Don't forget that bankers enjoy profits of bad loans, but when shits hits fan everybody suffers. This is just wrong.

I don't think SS is supposed to give you more than you put in.
It is more like an insurance scheme. If you die quickly you receive less, if you live more you get more. 
On average it is supposed to balance inflow and outflow. Say, if population will be stable SS will have neither deficit nor proficit.
So again, it is supposed to work like insurance where on average payouts are balanced with premiums. It is just that there is a huge delay between contributions and payouts, so it is impossible to balance it exactly.
And you are wrong, funds are used for something: they are used to buy bonds, so they receive  some interest.

No, that's not how Electrum works. You described brainwallet.
The difference is that Electrum directly encodes seed using mnemonic. It DOES NOT hash the list of words, but instead uses them to reconstruct bits of seed.
On the other hand, brainwallets usually hash a content of passphrase.
Practical difference is that in case with Electrum mnemonics you have 256 bits of entropy.

I understand what you're saying, but there is a reason why we prefer web wallet like blockchian.info to e-wallets which store all private keys on server in non-encrypted form, no?
Threat model is different... Basically, if private key is encrypted with a key known only to user, wallet operator can steal only funds which are in use right now.
While with a simpler e-wallet all funds can disappear in one moment.

Think about it: you published 500 bytes of data today, it is automatically replicated onto thousands Bitcoin nodes all over the world...

As most places wait 6 confirmations, transfer requires 60 minutes on average with Bitcoin, but only 15 minutes with Litecoin. That's nice, you can use money faster.


It is never a good idea to accept zero-confirmation transactions, because it is pretty much trivial to do it and it costs nothing.
E.g. suppose a modified version of wallet will send a double-spending send-to-self to a buddy miner. If your buddy miner mines that block first, he gets a kickback. In practice you'll see like 10% of purchases are free if your buddy miner has 10% of hashing power.
The only reason this doesn't happen yet is because people are altruistic, but a rational agent WILL double-spend.
I think it is a really dumb idea to rely on somebody's altruism.

I'm currently trying to work with bitcoinjs-server, which uses node.
Reliability of this thing does not please me, at all. For example, it needed a restart during testnet blockchain download, it just hanged on some block. (It was eating CPU so it wasn't a problem with the network.)
I have a couple of other components based on node.js. Basically they query data from bitcoinjs-server and populate a database, code is fairly simple... But it's simply a crapfest. It leaks memory and needs to be restarted, it crashes in weird ways.
So I have an impression that it is one of least reliable platforms I've ever worked with.
OK, maybe people who wrote these particular applications are to blame, or maybe I'm using a wrong version of node or something.
But something tells me it is not a terribly good idea to use a language without static type checking, running on a virtual machine optimized for showing LOLcats, to run anything finance-related.

Transaction with nLockTime in future cannot get into blockchain before that time.
Previously it was the case that it was stored in memory pool, but now they can't even get into mempool. And it is OK, actually.
Basically, nLockTime gives you an ability to back off after some delay, and that delay penalizes abuse or gives some time for negotiations.
For example, suppose there is a service provider and a customer. They do not trust each other very much, so they will put money into 2-signature transaction, with nLockTime'd rollback in future. If customer is satisfied with service, he will release money to service provider. If service provider agrees that he screwed it up, he will release money back to customer. However, if they disagree (e.g. service provider think he did great job but customer thinks it's shit), money can be released by nLockTime'd transaction, say, year from now. In that case customer suffers because he cannot use money for a year, but service provider doesn't get money for shitty job he have done.

It isn't up to devs to decide what can and cannot be included into blockchain.
Miner can include absolutely anything in block he mines, and as long as it can be parsed a valid block of transactions, other miners will accept it.
This is how Satoshi have designed it... Cryptographic data, by its nature, can be arbitrary, so you cannot prevent certain data from being included.
THE ONLY way around this is to have a radically different design where USERS will be responsible for keeping data related to outputs they own.

No, because you cannot distinguish coin which was lost permanently from coin which was lost temporarily.

Fee is necessary only if your transaction has output less than 0.01 BTC or is oversized (&gt;26 Kb). However, free transactions are subject to rate-limiting, i.e. if there are too many of them nodes will start ignoring some of them.
Note that output less than 0.01 might appear even if you do not want it, e.g. you're sending 0.1 BTC having a coin 0.107 BTC, 0.007 BTC will be sent as change to yourself.
In the end, isn't it easier to pay a tiny fee than to worry about this stuff?

PPCoin implements proof-of-stake approach.
Ripple.com implements distributed consensus approach.


I think you misunderstood what Laurie wrote. The idea is that if nodes are not anonymous, it is possible to use much, much less resources. Proof-of-work is _necessary_ only because we let miners to be 100% anonymous.
Basically, what we are trying to prevent is Sybil attack: we want to make it hard for an attacker to control the whole network. There are several possible approaches:
 * If participants are well-known entities which identify themselves. 1) It is highly unlikely that attacker controls all of them; 2) It is against their economic interestes to attack since they will suffer loss of reputation and won't be able to continue participating.
 * Proof-of-work: 1) Sybil attack requires lots of hardware and energy; 2) Attack makes no economic sense because of hardware and energy costs.
 * Proof-of-stake: 1) Sybil attack is hard because stake is scarce, buying enough of it requires lot of money; 2) Attack makes no economic sense because attacker will be deprived of stake which is valuable. (Or just coin he holds will be less valuable after attack.)
 * Network quorum, bandwidth and IP addresses are scarce...
Ripple is somewhat similar to what Laurie described.
Each of these approaches has shortcommings. People might say that anonymity is valuable, but in reality most of Bitcoin mining is done by pools which are not anonymously-run. So it is just bullshit.
In reality, I think, it is much easier to bootstrap PoW-based decentralized currency than it is to bootstrap a consensus-based one: former requires no trust and hence some dudes on forum can do that, while later requires participation of multiple serious companies.
But that doesn't mean that PoW is the right approach in the long run...

Bank is an institution which _borrows_ money from depositors and then lends it at higher interest rate.
Deposits are bank's liabilities, i.e. if you have $1000 in a bank account, it actually means that bank owes you $1000.
Bank's assets consist of its loan portfolio, money on various accounts, securities and so on.
Normally, amount of assets is higher than liabilities, and difference between assets and liabilities constitutes shareholder's equity.
When loans bank have given turn out to be bad, equity becomes smaller. When it goes close to zero, situation is bad: there is, essentially, no value in bank itself, and bank's ability to pay depositors becomes compromised.
There are several options at that point:
 * liquidation: assets are sold, proceedings are used to pay off liabilities. Usually it is inefficient, so depositors get only a fraction of their money back (and government has to compensate if it is mandated by law)
 * merger: other institution might find an opportunity to expand their business this way
 * recapitalization: shareholders add their own money to bank's capital
 * "bail out": government provides loans and/or becomes shareholder and injects money
What this article says is that government wants to avoid to get involved, which means that shareholders will have to take hit, and if that is not enough, depositors will.
It's worth noting that banks work differently from collective investment schemes: collective investment schemes provide no guarantees, but separate investor's capital from their own finances. I.e. it's like "Dude, give us money and we'll buy some cool securities with it... If they go bad, your problem". Collective investment schemes are supposed to provide full transparency.
Banks risk with their own capital first i.e. it's like "Dude, lend us money, we totally know how to manage it... If we fuck up, we lose our money before you do."

I've been involved in alt-coin design (particularly, anti-51%-attack measures), and I develop Bitcoin clients for living. It's very unlikely that I'm wrong.


There are no 'conflicting chains'. Attacker's goal is to create longer chain which will orphan latest N blocks in the existing chain.


Well, attacker invalidates transactions in last N blocks, potentially any transaction in these blocks can be double-spent, so he can do many double-spends in one go.
I would run me as a business: users will secretly send me their double-spend transactions, and I'll include them into my reorg-causing chain for profit.


Yes, of course it is possible to notice such reorg, but what are you going to do?


No. These things are automatizable. It is possible to run double-spend-as-a-service kind of business. (Which is likely more profitable than AnyPay.)
You aren't using security mindset... If there is a hole you should assume it will be exploited. A lot of things seem to be extremely unlikely, e.g. timing attacks. But they can be used for a successful attack.


Yes, it is much more likely that alt-coins will be attacked one at a time.


For practical purposes you should think that AnyPay and exchange is one entity.


You cannot really estimate it... We just don't have a decicated 51% attacker which is looking to maximize his profits. Loss in such attack can completely wipe fees exchange gets from trading.


Somebody needs to buy coins from miners. Miners aren't fools.


Then you aren't estimating viability properly. Litecoin could survive because Bitcoin eventually switched to ASIC. This means that Bitcoin miners cannot attack LItecoin.
If you have cryptocurrencies which use same PoW (and aren't merged-mined), then only one of them can be secure, it seems. 
Namecoin switched to merge-mining when it was threatened with 51% attack, GeistGeld, CoiledCoin and later BBQ coin were destroyed.
TerraCoin recently had serious problems with confirmations when somebody used ASIC to mine it and then abandoned (he wasn't even malicious).
So there are reasons why Litecoin survived.
In theory PPC and NVC can survive  because they are PoS-based (at least, in theory).
 Also, IIRC, there was a CPU-only coin, YAC I think. But it seems to have weak marketing team, so quite likely somebody will clone it and copycat might supersede it. (Same happened with Tenebrix and Fairbrix: Litecoin had better marketing, finite vs infinite supply.)

Well, it is 1 exaflop equivalent...
FLOP means FLOATING POINT operations per second. Bitcoin mining obviously does not involve floating point operations... However, GPU can do both integer and floating point operations, and so we can estimate how many floating point operations it could have done if it was doing them instead of mining.
But, of course, Bitcoin mining ASIC cannot do any floating point operations (AFAIU it computes hash on bit level), so there analogy breaks.

About a half of investors will lose. If you want to gamble, you'll have higher chances on Satoshi Dice.
On the other hand, if you just keep Bitcoins in your wallet you're guaranteed to win if Bitcoin gets wider adoption.
 There is already a lot of people competing for the mining market, moar participants won't help.
And "hoarding" Bitcoins is perfectly fine. People have been told that if you invest your Bitcoins they will be working, and this is somehow better for Bitcoin.
This is simply not true.
1. You give your Bitcoins to a company which manufactures ASIC miners.
2. It **sells** Bitcoins to pay for manufacturing
3. Somebody else gets your Bitcoins.
4. While you slowly get Bitcoins back from mining.
So such investments actually keep Bitcoin price down, they do not help to increase adoption.
Alternatively, your Bitcoins will end up in hands of a person which is likely wiser than you. It's probably good for that person, but doesn't really help Bitcoin that much.

This is definitely wrong. We, human beings, care about utility, and utility function is non-linear. You're supposed to maximize EV of utility.
Consider an example: You have a choice of whether to win
1. 2 trillion USD ($10^12 USD ) with probability of success being 1/10^9
2. 1000 USD with probability of success being 1
In the first case EV is 2000 USD, while in second it is only 1000 USD.
So which is better?
I'd say it doesn't really matter whether you have a chance to win 100 billions, 1 trillion or 10 trillions... At that point utility is already flat.

I don't think Bitcoins need to be ubiquitous just yet. They can have same role as PayPal and other payment systems/digital currencies: you cannot use PayPal to buy groceries, but it is useful to do purchases online.
My father uses only cash (credit cards are not so popular here in Ukraine), but when he needed to purchase something on eBay-like site, he got a debit card and paid via PayPal... It took a couple of hours to set it up and pay with it, by the way.
I don't think we need everybody to use Bitcoins. If 1% of population will start using it, it will only be a good start. And then problems we're talking about will be less and less relevant.

It is you who claim that 10 minutes is optimal, you should provide evidence for that.
You might that 10 minutes is optimal simply because Satoshi have chosen it, but it's just unjustified belief.

So it sounds like he was only concerned about space usage, not about speed of commercial transactions...

EDIT: Why do you retards downvote me? Obviously it makes sense to give cash tip + bitcoin tip to avoid looking like an asshole. It is so obvious that I didn't bother to mention it, I just described how bitcoin tip can be potentially improved ffs


Imagine you got Amazon gift card: you need to go to Amazon web site and buy something from it, you cannot simply redeem it for money.
Bitcoin tips can work in a same way. No download is necessary, you just get money in a web wallet, which you can spend only with Bitcoin-accepting merchants.
Perhaps we just need to redesign this service a bit:
 * create blockchain.info style wallet instead of redeeming it to user-provided address
 * call it a "gift card", it's way easier to understand that
 * a list of Bitcoin-accepting merchants

Somebody might discover a way to crack ECDSA, that might wreck a lot of chaos. But it's more like a mathematician discovering  a new property, not computer hacking.
Quite likely if there is a flaw in ECDSA we'll know that something is fishy long before it is practically possible to attack it, so we have time to switch to a different signature.
All in all it is extremely unlikely that somebody can hack the entire system.

However, 0.0003 BTC would be enough for a minimum relaying fee so it wil get to pools which accept lower-than-standard fee.

Price of one Bitcoin is totally arbitrary.
Say, Satoshi could choose initial reward to be 5 or 500. Then maximum monetary base will be 2.1M or 210M Bitcoins. In first case we'll achieve parity sooner, in second later. Does it matter?

Yes. It is a problem for things like user-defined assets (colored coins), smart contracts, smart property etc.
E.g. suppose a bank have created tokens represented US dollars on a blockchain, let's say 1 million dollars.
A blockchain forks, now there is a million dollars on each of two blockchains, 2 million dollars total. Blockchain states can diverge, so it's possible that Alice will own $1000 on Blockchain A and $0 on Blockchain B, while Bob owns $0 on Blockchain A and $1000 on Blockchain B.
Obviously, the bank needs to declare that only one of blockchains is real from its perspective, i.e. it will honor its obligations only on one of blockchains, let's say Blockchain A.
That's a mess banks would rather avoid.
It's even worse when there is no authority which can decide it for everyone.
E.g. suppose Alice and Bob have entered an agreement which decides a fate of a physical object. E.g. Alice wishes to sell her house to Bob, and expects Bob to pay in ETH. This contract might be tied to their real-world identities, and thus be legally enforceable.
So suppose that Bob have paid, but only on Ethereum Classic blockchain, and the state of the contract says that Bob now owns the house, and it's confirmed.
So now it's probably up to a government to decide which is the really real blockchain: the original blockchain, or one which has the majority of the hashpower?
It's a huge mess, and in practice this means that people &amp; business will avoid blockchain-based smart contracts which deal with external world property.

Meni Rosenfeld [demonstrated]( that if attack is probabilisitic (i.e. attacker has hashrate which is a fraction of network's hashrate) what matters is number of blocks. So all being equal, higher number of blocks per unit of time is better.
Of course, there are many other factors at work, such as block propagation speed, so in reality it's more complex, but definitely not "only 1/4 secure".

At that point amount of newly mined bitcoins will be tiny, however, miners potentially can get a lot from transaction fees.

Yes, you probably want some optimized client-server protocol, though.

Currently to protect users from sending colored coins to clients which cannot accept them we use a special address format.
We also can use a special wallet file format which will be incompatible with regular Bitcoin clients. You just cannot accidentally use it.
You can export your private keys and import them in a different client, but at that point I assume you know you what you're doing.
Also, it is a problem only with order-based coloring. But implementations based on satoshi-tracking or color-tagging won't have this problem.
We are exploring different implementations now, if there will be a problem will switch to a different approach.

OK, suppose an attacker can create a double-spend.
But you don't have a good argument against split detection/double-spend detection, do you?
Let's consider a concrete scenario, suppose network is split 33%/66%. Suppose vendor waits 6 confirmations.
Smaller side will get 6 block on top of split block in approximately 3 hours when larger network will produce 12 blocks.
Do you think it is hard to detect split in software in these conditions? We have plenty of time and plenty blocks from the other chain to observe.
Also, difference in difficulty isn't relevant if we are talking about ~6 blocks.
And I think that sensitive merchants (like payment processors) should wait more than 6 confirmations.
While less sensitive merchants will be fine with less confirmations. It's highly unlikely that people will utilize network split to buy Steam games from an individual merchant.

What if I give you BTC and you don't give me a valid secret key? How do I find you at all?
Colored coin trade transactions are atomic, if you pay Bitcoins you are guaranteed to receive shares. No trust is required, so you can trade with strangers, completely anonymously.
Which means that you can make an order book out of an IRC channel (for example), and it will work securely.
Other important aspect is that there is no server to seize, and everybody can operate without identifying themselves. Thus it is pretty much impossible that authorities will have any effect on trade.
I believe there is a reason why we use Bitcoin rather than centrally-cleared currency, and same reason can be applied to decentralized peer-to-peer capital markets.

Have you tried reading the article? It has all necessary information.
@_date: 2013-03-26 16:34:21
Information in you article isn't accurate. Either you weren't attentive, or it is based on older version.
Code which constructs transactions typically tries to play safe and overpay, it isn't accurate in any way, if you want accurate information about fees you need to check code which performs checks, there are two places:
`1.` `GetMinFee()` is called from  `CTxMemPool::accept()`:  
It is used to guard against dust spam. Fee is required if there is an output which is &lt;0.01 BTC or if transaction size is more than 26 KB. In this case min fee is 0.0001 BTC, it is a constant.
Also free transactions are subject to rate-limiting. "At default rate it would take over a month to fill 1GB", but it is configurable.
`2.` `CreateNewBlock()`: 
It doesn't rely on `GetMinFee()`, instead it follows its own policies, which are configurable
`CreateNewBlock()` doesn't check for "dust spam" because it is already checked by `CTxMemPool::accept()`.
The default policy is:
1. Order transactions by priority and accept them into free region, which is 27 KB by default.  Only transactions with priority higher than  COIN * 144 / 250 are eligible.
2. Once no space left in free region or there are no transactions with high enough priority, it sorts transactions by dFeePerKb, which must be at least nMinTxFee. Which is 0.0005 BTC by default.
3. There is an exception, though: if nBlockMinSize isn't reached yet, miner will accept transactions with lower fee.
So here's how it is different from your article:
1. If you have output with value &lt;0.01 BTC you need to pay 0.0001 BTC fee. Not 0.0005 BTC.
2. To get to paid part of block you need to pay 0.0005 BTC _per KB_ according to recommended policy. If transaction size is 260 bytes required fee is 0.00013 BTC, not 0.0005 BTC.

When you issue colored coins, a _color definition_ (or _asset definition_) is created. It describes how to track it and what it is. This color definition can be uploaded to a directory server, or you can share it with others on your site.
Other people will find this color definition either via directory or by other means and make their client aware of it, from now on they can recognize this color, trade it etc.
I guess I have to show the preview version we have now after all: (keep in mind that it is kinda broken and we'll make a better demo soon): 
You can see a drop down, it is list of colors it fetched from directory. If you issue your own it will add your color to this list.
If you go to Menu-&gt;Settings-&gt;Color settings, you can edit this list and add colors from different servers.
Of course, eventually there will be directories which include only established, trustworthy color definitions, rather than colors from everybody on the internet.
Also people discuss possibility to include color definition into blockchain itself, perhaps using Namecoin for it, but for now we prefer to do it externally.

From what I see, "market cap" of a cryptocurrency is related to a community which stands behind it. I.e. Litecoin got significant market cap because it has a lot of vocal supporters.

Also, this is what we have on market now, is it fickle? Depends on what you call fickle.

Compromised the hosting account...? Are you telling me that it was hosted on VPS?
It is a well-known fact that virtual private servers are not secure enough to host Bitcoin wallet, precisely because they are vulnerable to a variety of attacks which simply cannot affect a physical server.

But the fact that miners _might_ own some bitcoins doesn't mean that problems are impossible.
Particularly, suppose we have several cryptocurrencies with different properties: Bitcoin (SHA-256 PoW) and Peercoin (proof-of-stake).
If miner finds out that there is a problem with Bitcoin, they might exchange bitcoins for peercoins, while continuing Bitcoin mining as long as it is profitable.

ebay is, essentially, an auction listing service with reputation system and dispute mediation.

2. Reputation can be handled using p2p constructs like web-of-trust, or via Bitcoin "fidelity bonds".
3. Dispute mediation can be provided as a service in a secure fashion.

First, just to make it clear, BitContracts.org will never be a party to any transaction, it will merely provide software and (possibly) communication services for escrow operators.
Now, say, if escrow operator disappears, your money is blocked forever.
However, there are several ways to mitigate this problem.
One thing is that there is a strong economic incentive for an escrow operator to not disappear like this: it might collect fees for unblocking funds.
Note that in context of escrow, allowing third parties to know private key is not such a big issue, compared to having private key completely lost. So escrow operators will be encouraged to back up their private key in multiple places. Also, they can choose to send parts of private key (which can be split using Shamir's secret sharing scheme) to trusted 3rd parties (such as Bitcoin core developers), so that key can be recovered even if all backups are lost.
Another way to handle this issue is to create a "contract" transaction which will unblock user's funds after some time, or after certain conditions are met.
In the most basic way, nLockTime delay transaction for a year (for example), and this transaction with nLockTime will be handed to user.
This is only suitable for services which work with small-scale deposits and can afford losses.
A classic example is a security deposit as an anti-spam measure.
A better approach is to make transaction with nLockTime in future, but give it to some semi-trusted party instead of giving it to a user directly.
If if escrow operator disappears this semi-trusted party will release this transactions so that user can get his money back, and nLockTime prevents abuse: funds cannot be released immediately.
Please note that none of schemes is perfect, but I think some of them are quite reasonable

Mining is needed to prevent double-spends: once transaction is in blockchain, everybody agrees that it exists, and spending coins again is not possible.
Block reward is used to
 * encourage mining when transaction volume is small at start
 * make sure that coin distribution is fair, in the sense it is impartial: it is an automatic process, it isn't possible to rig it
 * make the idea more attractive: initially when Bitcoin was released people were able to mine coins for themselves, and that liked it and spread the word


Who decides who is eligible for grabbing coins? How would you prevent people from grabbing more than they should?

I guess the main difference is that core developers are looking for an elegant solution which solves everything.
I'm looking for a solution which eliminates all possible practical attack vectors.
It might be far from elegant. For example, if block is rejected (i.e. it comes from a forked chain), we can still extract transactions from it, and if we detect that they double-spend transaction to us, we'll warn merchant to not trust this transaction. Thus attacker won't get any goods.
This offers a solid protection against double-spends as long as:
1. We can get blocks from 'bad' chain
2. We can extract transactions from them
I'd say that both assumptions are realistic. But it is just not elegant to rely on this.

Well, if we consider the effect on Bitcoin price (rather than effect on society), the only demographic you need is super-wealthy.
I think so far we barely scratched the surface. When buying bitcoins will be as mainstream as buying shares of tech companies, Bitcoin "market cap" will grow quite a bit.
(It might help if one of Bitcoin companies (Coinbase, BitPay) goes public.)
As for mass adoption, in reality 0.1% of people owns 80% of world's wealth (according to [this]( wikipedia page), so it isn't important in the sense you described.
We won't run out of "significantly wealthy" people, but these people will buy more and more bitcoins when they will be confident that Bitcoin is worthy.
Of course, mass adoption can help with that, but its effect on price can be indirect.

1. No, it isn't retarded.
2. Of course, it isn't possible to check if their _servers_ are as secure as they say, but if encryption happens on the client side, I need to be sure that it is done right. I cannot check this if client is closed-sourced.
3. Of course, open source code can have backdoors too, but at least chances that backdoor will be discovered are fairly high. On the other hand, chances that backdoor in closed source software will be detected sooner rather than later are low.
4. Let's be realistic. If it is a closed-source backup software, it is very natural to insert a backdoor in it, as it is hard to tell normal activity from malicious. On the other hand, it is very hard to implement a backdoor of that kind in CPU.
5. Also we need to take into account that Intel is a huge public corporation with dozens of billions of dollars in revenues. If they make a backdoor it will totally destroy their reputation, so many billions of dollars are at risk here. On the other hand, SpiderOak is a small company. Costs of setting up a honeypot like this are small, so this is what you should be concerned with.

Now if one stops lamenting that it should have been the other way, there are probably some "macroeconomic" lessons we can get about alt-coins.
If they really add no value, how does it happen that they have significant market cap?
Well, you can notice that market cap correlates with how **passionate** people are about alt-coin. Say, initially there were three scrypt-based alt-coins: Tenebrix, Fairbrix and Litecoin. But only Litecoin survived. Why?
Because there was a community behind it. A lot of people became fans of it, and they started promoting it, possibly irrationally. But they managed to create a little economy around Litecoin, and now we can say that Litecoin has non-zero value.
For example, let's consider [Litecoin Global]( stocks and bonds listed there must pay dividends in Litecoin according to contract. Now that means there is always some demand for Litecoin (as long as these companies exist and honor contracts): these companies will buy Litecoins from market to pay dividends.
So, apparently, efforts spent by Litecoin adopters (particularly, Ethan Burnside who created Litecoin Global, and later btct.co) created some real value behind Litecoins.
This is actually quite similar to how public companies work: employees do some work and that creates value for shareholders. Thus cryptocoins can be likened to shares, and community of people who builds economy around it are like employees. (Employees are often shareholders too, btw.)
You might try to argue that companies pay dividends but cryptocoins do not. But in fact there is a plenty of companies which do not pay dividends, shareholders assume that value is linked to revenues, margins etc. If there is a disconnect between share value and company value, company can do a share buyback, thus creating extra demand.
But when cryptocurrency is successful demand for it increases, so we, basically, have same mechanism which links value to economic activity.
Of course, there are cryptocurrencies which no economy behind them, their price is pure speculation, and quite often market cap is so small that it can entirely explained by irrational speculators buying it at random... And then there are cryptocurrencies which aren't traded anywhere, we can safely assume that their value is 0.
Nobody has a complete model of "alt-coin macroeconomics", but it is fairly obvious that there is more to it than abstract ramblings about supply and demand.
One thing which is certain is that currency is always linked to people/companies/entities which use it. This is true for fiat currencies, for example, exchange rate of a national currency is linked to activity of a country which uses it. And it is true for cryptocurrencies too: their exchange rate is linked to activities of  communities which stand behind them.

I assume that some fraction of miners will stay honest to original rules. 
People who prefer original rules will only accept confirmations via non-inflationary blocks. (And, of course, money coming form coinbase of inflationary blocks won't be accepted.)
If those people are in majority, inflationary blocks will simply be ignored, so it's same as if they did not exist.
It doesn't matter whether inflation proponents own 1% or 99% of mining, the only thing which matters is what is accepted by merchants/exchanges etc.

It is hardly an improvement.  That untraceable cash they are proposed is based on very advanced and complex crypto scheme, and it is untraceable.
While Bitcoin, at least its core, is very simple. It is simply an application of a digital signature scheme, ECDSA.
The groundbreaking idea behind Bitcoin is that it relies on economic incentives rather than complex crypto constructs.
So Bitcoin is not an improvement of previous untraceable cash schemes, and quite likely it is created by a new guy with a fresh look rather than by a seasoned crypto specialist.
On the other hand, Zerocoin combines untraceability with decentralization. So Zerocoin might be seen as an improvement of both.
All in all I think a dude like Tatsuaki Okamoto would have created something like Zerocoin right away.

scrypt is supposed to be memory-hard, so that cipher-breaking on ASICs would be no more efficient than on convention hardware.
However, parameters chosen by ArtForz (and then copied by coblee) do not make it very memory-hard.

But this doesn't meant that it is "not very secure". It's just a matter of characteristics required from optimal hardware.

This isn't a new idea, I saw a plenty of similar proposals.
The main problem is that it won't be secure as you don't have same proof-of-work as Bitcoin has, and so it makes very little sense. If you want a system where everybody just trusts issuer or central server, just use Open Transactions or something similar to it. Bitcoin blockchain and mining offers no advantages in that case.
But it is a bad idea to let issuer to run trading servers... Suppose issuer defaults, and you make a claim in courts presenting evidence that you own bonds. But if issuer runs the server he will be able to fake everything, so there is no way to tell legit bondholders from fake ones.
Now while we are at it, colored coins have some advantages:
 * No maintenance required: Just buy some coins to color them, and pay fees when you transact. No need to run server. 
 * Availability: if Bitcoin itself is up and running, trade can happen.
 * Secure trade via atomic coin swapping: there is no need to trust anybody, you can trade colored coins for uncolored ones directly, is a secure manner.

It's still being developed and not completely specified yet. 
There is a whitepaper: 
But it's not how it works now... Currently it uses order-based coloring and no special format for genesis transactions.


Currently we're improving both the software (we want to add an ability to work without local bitcoin-qt, better p2ptrade and so on) and the protocol itself (more efficient coloring scheme).
If somebody wanted to issue shares right now we could prioritize protocol development and make version which isn't nice, but works properly.
But otherwise, we aim to make a fully usable release in January. (Actually I hoped it would be available early in December, but there were significant delays...)


It's not possible with ChromaWallet: red coins have one kind of an address (a special _color address_ format), green coins have another address, wallet won't allow you to confuse the two.

You do not take into account utility.
Simplified example: Suppose you need a certain medical treatment to survive, it costs 100 BTC. You only have 1 BTC. If you do not find 99 more BTC, you'll die.
In this case it is rational to gamble, because your long-term utility is zero if you have less than 100 BTC. It doesn't matter if you have 0 BTC or 1 BTC. Thus the expected value of _utility_ is positive.
In simple terms, it is not all about money.
Let's consider a different example: suppose you have enough money to have food and shelter for the rest of your life. But food and shelter isn't enough, as a human you also want some entertainment. Whether you win or lose, gambling provides entertainment, so it is actually rational if you take into account a subjective utility function.


I think you do not understand that it is impossible to apply math directly to real-world situations, it is always applied in context of some model, and choice of model is subjective.
You assume that individual always tries to maximize amount of money he has, but it is obviously broken model which doesn't match the reality.

That's my experience: moving money between LTC-GLOBAL and btc-e takes 15 minutes, but paying for something with Bitcoin often take 1 hour.


This isn't true, for most kinds of attacks number of confirmations matter.

If you're interested, I can show you the formula. But you can also find paper by Meni Rosenfeld, he came to same conclusion, although he was using simpler model. And, well, there is analysis in Sathoshi's paper.

Designing a client specifically for colored coins definitely has some advantages, particularly: 
 * it is desirable to have a sub-wallet for each asset (set of colors)
 * we can do our own state management (e.g. if we aren't sure about color of specific UTXO it shouldn't be spendable)
 * user interface can designed to handle multiple assets
This is what we're doing with NGCCC. Currently (CCoinDemo) it relies on a local bitcoind to fetch transaction information via JSON-RPC API, but uses external service to discover UTXOs.
It wasn't hard to implement: it took me two days to write coloredcoinlib (I used prototype made by another guy as a reference, though), and implemented a wallet using pycoin (by Richard Kiss) for transaction signing and blockchain.info API for UTXO discovery. It took him three days, IIRC. (BTW, Plazmotech is 12 years old... So, 12 y.o. dude implemented a colored coin wallet in 3 days.)
While it is an almost-complete proof-of-concept, as you can imagine, it is shitty as fuck.
So here's an approximate plan of further development:
1. speed up blockchain scan
2. use external service to speed up colored coin scan
3. generate private keys deterministically from a seed
4. implement 'send' correctly
5. persist color configuration in wallet
6. make sure that state management is right
7. implement command line, RPC API and GUI
8. add p2ptrade
9. etc.
None of these things are particularly hard, some are even trivial, but many of them require careful thinking.
E.g. when we got an UTXO, we need to check whether it belongs to a segment of blockchain we already scanned for colored coin transactions, otherwise we might spend colored coin as uncolored one.

No, you can do second-preimage attack on SHA-256 alone.
You don't need same key, you need key which hashes to same address.
If you can find K2 such that SHA-256(K2) = SHA-256(K1) where K1 is public key of coin being attacked. Then also you have:
    RIPEMD160(SHA256(K2)) = RIPEMD160(SHA256(K1))
So it is same address, but different key.

What I described isn't end-game, it is an intermediate "some people find Bitcoin promising" stage.
Currently Bitcoin is used mostly by enthusiasts. The next stage is, probably, an appeal to a wider audience and offer to solve some problem which bugs them.
For example, Cypriot banks showed people that storing money in banks isn't safe. People will start looking for other ways to do that, and _some_ of them will find Bitcoin viable. (You know, it is already news in some major outlets.)
When _millions_ of people will start investing _thousands_ of bucks into Bitcoin, price will get at least to $1000. I believe we'll get there by summer.
End game is something different. If some fraction of population (say, 10%) will seriously start using Bitcoin, we'll get at least to $100000. Or there will be a problem of some sort, then price might plummet, potentially to zero...


Yes, it is very likely that there will be a problem.
But I consider risk and potential valuation being different things.

Yes, first version of client had CPU mining built in, so early adopters often were mining and got considerable quantities of Bitcoins. That was Satoshi's original vision: to distribute Bitcoin among ordinary users, and let ordinary users to secure the network. (Of course, people who then got into Bitcoin development mined some too.)
He was aware of possibility GPU mining, of course, so he asked for a gentlemen agreement not to use GPUs for mining for a couple of years... Because GPU mining is more like a commercial activity, but he wanted to give random users to get a chance to mine some Bitcoins so they'll get as spread as possible instead of being concentrated in hands of few.
This was a good idea... Suppose you know that 90% of Bitcoins belong to several dudes who were mining early... And they can anything they want with exchange rate. Would you use Bitcoin in that case?

Small transactions should be done via shared wallets which won't make a proper Bitcoin transaction for each payment but will instead settle internally.
Shared wallets are not as secure as private wallets, sure. But it doesn't matter much if you have like $10 in such wallet.
Moreover, you could deposit your money via blockchain escrow, so such shared wallet provider won't be able to run away with it...
We just need clients, protocols and infrastructure to handle this.
I don't think we should reduce transaction fees just so you can buy Coke from a vending machines.
Bitcoin protocol is not supposed to be used for vending machines! It relies on proof-of-work confirmations, so secure payments cannot be fast.
It makes perfect sense to use Bitcoin for larger settlements, and use shared wallets for micropayments. Of course shared wallets will be fully backed by Bitcoin, and when merchant accumulates enough money he will be able to move away Bitcoins proper.

We were aware of MasterCoin when we were designing colored coin protocol (it's quite possible that it was an inspiration, I'm not sure), but we deliberately decided to keep it simple and implement a minimal protocol which will do the thing.
Particularly, important difference is in performance: colored coin client needs to scan history of one specific color, while MasterCoin client needs to scan _the whole blockchain_. This makes a difference for thin clients.
(But I gotta say, even colored coins are less than perfect for thin clients, it's just the best thing we could do without making a new alt-coin for it.)
Another difference is robustness: colored coin transactions are Bitcoin transactions, and they behave in exactly the same way.
But MasterCoin transactions are conceptually different, and so they are subject to all kinds of new woes.
And, finally, colored coins do not create unspendable transaction outputs... This is kinda a problem for Bitcoin blockchain because miners have to keep all unspent transaction outputs in memory, so if MasterCoin will get successful, it will increase memory requirements for all miners, creating a memory leak of sorts.

Well, to buy 100 shares for 0.1 BTC each, you send 10.00000100 to security's BUY address, which belongs to OSE server. 
OSE server will return 0.000001 BTC back, and will hold 10 BTC until somebody sells 100 shares.
It is 100% completely centralized because there can be only one server which controls the wallet. That server is responsible for holding bids/asks.
Bitcoin blockchain is used as a communication method, it doesn't make it decentralized.

Totally. We need governments to see it as a competition: They need to be afraid that if they over-regulate Bitcoin, other countries will be ahead of them.
I don't know if it's the case, but it looks like China already tries to compete. Quite likely they see Bitcoin as something which can counter USD's domination.
Now if US government/Congress will recognize it, they will be afraid of banning Bitcoin "just in case", as it might be seen as an extremely backward action if Bitcoin gets a wider adoption.
Few more iterations, and Bitcoin will become basically unstoppable: even if governments will be afraid of Bitcoin, banning it locally will only damage themselves. Only a global ban will be effective, but it is extremely unlikely as there will always be a country which can say "fuck you, we'll embrace it".

Sadly we don't have a usable version of software now, so I don't recommend doing anything with real assets/real Bitcoins.
If you just want to know how it works in theory, here's the idea:
1. In a colored coin client there is an 'issue' button. It asks you questions about number of coins you want to issue, name, etc.
2. Once you fill the form it creates a transaction with required amount of coins and creates _color definition_  which has information about transaction, name, etc. Importantly, it also has ColorID which is an unique identifier of this color.
3. Now you want to link color you create with asset. To do this you need to create a text document with a contract which mentions ColorID you got, e.g. "I, John Smith, hereby promise to exchange one unit of coins identified by ColorID &lt;ColorID&gt; for 1 US dollar under such and such conditions". Then you need to sign this document, for example with PGP key you have.
4. Now if people can verify that you signed this contract and they trust you to do exchange as promised, they might want to buy them, or accept them as payment.
So that's it: software colors coins, you write a contract which makes them valuable.
If you just want to try it in practice, here's a web client which works on testnet: 
But I should note that it is work-in-progress, so some things are not as smooth as they should be, or are broken. 
1. Grab few testnet coins from faucet, this:  or this: 
2. It should show your Bitcoin balance.
3. Click 'issue'. If you leave unit size as is (10000), each Bitcoin lets you to create 10000 units. But don't forget that you have to have some spare BTC for fees and whatnot. So enter amount and name you want.
4. If it works correctly, you can select coins you issued in dropdown and it will show balance.
5. You can only send coins to people who have your color definition installed. New wallet gets all definitions from server, but otherwise it is in Menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; Color settings.
6. Suppose you issued maraoz-coins. Person who wants to receive them needs to select maraoz-coins in the dropdown to get an address for maraoz-coins.
7. He gives this address to you, you also select maraoz-coins in dropdown, and now you can send them...
There is also p2ptrade, a peer-to-peer exchange. You can sell your coins:
1. Select them in dropdown.
2. Click 'p2ptrade'
3. Fill the box which says "Sell maraoz-coins" and click sell.
4. It will issue an order, which will be displayed below.
5. Now other person needs to buy it. He needs maraoz-coins definition installed as noted above and selected in dropdown. He also needs some testnet-Bitcoins to buy them with.
6. So he enters p2ptrade section, sees your ask, and fills buy form with same quantity and price as yours. Now when he clicks 'Buy' your clients will try to negotiate a transaction, it might take 10 seconds or so. If everything works correctly, offers will disappear and you'll see coins changing hangs: you get Bitcoins, other person gets maraoz-coins.

There is no assurance, but paying fee recommended by client probably does that in practice.
Note that "as fast as the network allows" is 10 minutes on average. (Assuming that current hashrate is close to difficulty and miners are reasonable and network isn't overloaded.)




Yes, but it is more likely that miners will consider your transaction being a spam, they have no incentive to include it into a block.


Currently second transaction's fee won't help the first transaction. However, we expect that mining software will be updated to handle this case. (I.e. take dependent transaction fees into account.)




Yes, there are several possible solutions. Basically idea is that merchant doesn't trust a random user, but he can trust some service which guarantees lack of double-spends.

Trying to find a perfect solution can be a problem. If your budget is limited, you need guarantees that you'll get what you want.

It makes more sense to hire an expert in this field who can take input from theymos and can design architecture/write specification.

Also government can forbid all encrypted traffic... I've heard it was a problem in Belarus: it was not outright forbidden, but companies which uses encryption were monitored.
If there is a ban on use of encrypted communication (incl. SSL, SSH etc), your only hope is steganography, i.e. hiding data in media streams, for example.

Wrong. Controlling more than 50% of hashpower gives you several abilities:
1. Perform successful double-spend with probability of 1.
2. Ignore blocks from other miners, so you get all the rewards.
3. Do not include transactions into your blocks, so that they won't be confirmed.
4. Replace transaction history (up to the last checkpoint).
Attacker cannot dictate what blockchain says, he cannot change how many bitcoins one has aside from two cases: double-spending and orphaning previously mined blocks.
Attacker won't be able to change any rules.


Yes, but having hashing power helps immensely.

To elaborate on race condition, it is not as bad as I thought, but security depends on timing.
Suppose that transaction back to Alice locks in 1 hour. Transaction back to Bob locks in 10 hours.
If Bob does not reveal his secret within 1 hour, Alice's transaction locks and she will get  her money back as soon as miner will include her transaction into block.
But BEFORE Alice's transaction is in the block, Bob can still get coins in Alice's chain.
As you have noted, miners can ignore standard rules and include Bob's tx in a block even if Alice's transaction is in mempool.
So suppose Alice's return transaction lingers for 9 hours for some reason. Bob can try to do spend in Alice's chain right before his return transaction locks.
In that case both his transfer in Alice's chain is eligible for inclusion (it isn't according to standard rules, but miners can simply ignore mempool), and Bob's return in Bob's chain is also eligible because it locks.
If his transactions will be mined, Bob can get his own coins back and also Alice's coins.
All he needs to do is to prevent Alice's return transaction from inclusion into block. This can be done in a number of ways:
 * network-level blockade, i.e. Bob might back Alice's router to prevent her communicating with real Bitcoin nodes
 * bribery: miners lose nothing from not including Alice's transaction, but Bob might offer some payment
 * it can be a natural glitch
So cross-chain trade is definitely not as secure as atomic coin swapping. Maybe it is secure enough, but it is a matter of opinion.
In any case, I prefer a simple and reliable solution.

So I had to check what others are saying about this, and I've found a message where Meni Rosenfeld says that it is exponential with mean 10 minutes.
I think this counter-intuitiveness comes from the fact that we're underestimating contributions of larger wait times. Say, if you wait 40 minutes in one case, you need next three cases to be instantaneous to get to an average of 10.
So this kind of "long tail" really adds up.

I think you should start by defining this proposal clearly.
What happens if buffer transaction is double-spent and reorged away?
More importantly, how do you cancel transfer?
Two-factor auth seems to be a much clearer solution. Second (or third) factor might be done by some kind of service which introduces a delay.
E.g. you send a request to BitcoinSavings, it waits 24 hours, and if there are no problems discovered, it will sign a transaction. Owner can then proceed adding his signatures and submitting tx to network.
This provides a clear way to cancel transfer. But how exactly "buffer transaction" does?

This isn't quite true. The problem is that international wire transfers are a lot like Ripple.
They do not work with real US dollars, they settle debts between themselves.
For example, suppose European bank needs to send money to a Japanese bank. Both of them have accounts in American bank, let's say JPMorgan.
So they instruct JPMorgan to transfer money from European bank's account to Japanese bank's account.
This is the simple case. Now let's say they don't have an account in JPMorgan... Now what? Chain gets longer.
For example, European bank will instruct JPMorgan to transfer money into Japanese bank's account in Citi...
This is byzantine... This is why it takes several days to do an international wire transfer.
Add to this that endpoints have to comply with various regulations, which means that they have  to inspect each transfer manually.

Length of passphrase is irrelevant. What matters is probability somebody can generate it by chance.
If this combination of words was already written somewhere or spoken, we know that somebody already generated it, and thus probability is 1: i.e. it is a very shitty passphrase.
One way to generate an unique passphrase is to use several _unrelated_ parts each of which has high entropy.
For example, "I like turtles" is in dictionary. "S-Katon" is in dictionary too.
But "I like turtles, S-Katon" isn't in dictionary (well, it wasn't in dictionary until I wrote this comment), so we know that it's less likely that attacker will be able to generate it.
Add some more elements, e.g. "I like turtless -- S-Katon, 2013-09-28", and that would be a reasonable passphrase.

When transaction is in block which is part of the best chain.
Miners always add a  block on top of most recent one. But sometimes two miners generate block at the same time. In that case one of blocks will be orphaned: it won't be part of the best chain.
This is why we wait ~6 confirmations: when there are 5 blocks on top of our block, it is very unlikely it will be orphaned.


Basically, the longest one. 


You cannot start a new chain, you can only add blocks to existing one. And, of course, adding a block is hard...
If you do not add block on top of the most recent block, your block won't make a longest chain so it will be orphaned, ignored by other clients... So this makes no sense.
Unless you own more than 50% of total hash rate. In that case you can keep on making your own blocks and eventually you can make it the longest chain.

It can be either issuers exposure (equivalent to investing into Bitcoin) if price of Bitcoin is not included into colored coin price. Or it can investor's exposure if value of a coin representing 1 USD IOU is calculated as:
     value of 1 USD + value of 0.0001 BTC
In either way, if coins are already issued, one of parties will enjoy the gain due to Bitcoin appreciation, it's hardly a bad thing.
If we are talking about issuing coins, then I believe mintxfee will decrease as Bitcoin price will go up, so issuing coins won't be more expensive. Say if one Bitcoin is $1000 then probably 1000 satoshi is enough per one unit.
If it is still high you can issue larger units. Say, bonds worth $10 or $100. One needs to find balance between overhead costs and liquidity.
Sure, theoretically it is bad as it complicates calculations. Practically people can live with it, I guess, as overhead is usually less than 1% (if you do it right). And it is not so much overhead as it is exposure.
It is not uncommon for a payment system/trading system to have a fee on scale of 1%, and surely getting Bitcoin exposure on that scale is better than permanent loss of money in fees...


Well, and 1% cost to issue suddenly makes it no-deal? Why?

Here's how it started: 
I tried to explain problems to Ron Gross, but he was playing dumb.
Of course, you can add features as you go, but it is absolutely necessary to have the spec versioned, to add new features according to a schedule.
For example, suppose version 1.0 enables only simple sends. It is in effect until block 300000.
Version 1.1 adds distributed transactions, and so on.
This way it is workable, it can be secure. Developers should have a concrete target, not something which changes all the time.
I actually spent a lot of time describing the problem, possible solutions, etc.
Ron and others completely ignored everything I was trying to explain.
If you do not want Mastercoin to be a joke, you need to be serious about it. Security should be top concern. People who do not understand this should be fired.
If you do not care about what I'm saying, you'll learn it the hard way: somebody will find a way to exploit Mastercoin's lack of consensus and will start scamming people with it
First and foremost you need to improve your process, not the spec and not software.

Pruning doesn't work the way you think it works. A new miner has to download a WHOLE BLOCKCHAIN.
So existing mining pools would want blockchain to be as large as possible so that it is hard for new pool (or solo miners) to join.
It is possible to get only unspent transaction output list instead of a whole blockchain, but then you're at mercy of a person who have prepared that UTXO list, so it kinda undermines security.

Cool story, bro, but very few applications actually use hardware RNG.
Only newest generation of Intel CPUs have a hardware RNG (Ivy Bridge).
It was not available in 2009, so it was utterly fucking impossible for a CPU vendor to influence random numbers.
But even if you have Ivy Bridge processor, it _does not mean_ that you have to rely on Intel's DRNG: it depends on what libraries and OS uses as a source of entropy.

Nobody claims that it is unconditionally superior... Superiority depends on assumptions and priorities.


Thin clients need only block headers, but they need block headers.
Satoshi assumed that commercial organizations (miners, merchants) will run full nodes, they'll buy whatever hardware is necessary.
But a chain of headers is required for SPV, so its total size should be small enough for an average Joe...
Consider a wallet implemented in browser. Currently we have about 300000 blocks, each block is 80 bytes, so whole chain of headers is 24MB long. It's feasible to download it each time from scratch, and it is feasible to keep it in RAM.
If we had 1 minute interblock interval, we'd have 240 MB of block headers by now... Now download can be slow, keeping it in RAM is undesirable.
Don't forget that in some parts of the world people have bad internet connection, 240 MB can be a big deal for them.
And if client cannot download a full chain of block headers, it won't be able to do SPV properly, it will have to trust servers... And Satoshi was definitely concerned with things like that.

Let's see. They have two Avalons, hasing at 140 GH/s total. (That's a bit low for two Avalons, but anyway.)
With 24000 shares issued, it gives you 5.8 MH/s per share.
It makes sense to compare it to price of PMBs. [TAT.VIRTUALMINE]( is traded around 0.001 BTC/MH/s.
[DMS.MINING]( is traded at 0.0005 BTC/MH/s
Which means that @ 0.016 BTC/share, Fenix is at least 3 times overpriced.
Reinvestment strategy doesn't improve anything.
Dividend is indeed high, but it is high for PMBs too. Say, TAT.VirtualMine pays 1.35% of its price daily.
But the thing is, dividend gets lower each time difficulty increases.
If difficulty increases exponentially, it can be modeled as [geometric series]( and its sum gives you total payout... There is a simple formula. Total payout is finite, and you barely break even.

If it is a problem, it is possible to make a cryptocurrency consisting of two interacting parts: one will offer exactly same security model as Bitcoin, another will be microtransaction-friendly, but offer a different kind of guarantee. If security of microtransactional part is somehow compromised, other part will be largely unaffected.

Satoshi Nakamoto have chosen to add complex [scripting]( to Bitcoin protocol, so that it would be possible to have features like [contracts](
He definitely anticipated advanced use cases and was interested in them.
But if Bitcoin blockchain can only represent ownership of Bitcoins, usefulness of contracts becomes limited. Hence there is a desire to control ownership of external things via the blockchain.
This is the idea behind [smart property](
Colored coins are simply an extension of the idea of Bitcoin-based smart property. Or you could say that it is simply a different term for it.
So I'd say it is quite in the spirit of the original Bitcoin design. (Add to this that Bitcoin-based smart property was first described by Mike Hearn, who was close with Satoshi and learned about 'contracts' from him. )

Paper considers incentive-feasible allocation of resources, i.e. the way how resources which are produced by agents are distributed among them. Such allocation should try to maximize utility function of each agent, and incentive-feasible means that agent cannot increase his utility by switching to autarky, i.e. consuming all resources he produces by himself.
Paper shows that memory is actually superior to money in the sense it can produce better allocation (i.e. one which is better at maximizing utility functions) in cases where money cannot. But money is better than no money.
I am not an economist (I am a mathematician), but this kinda makes sense... With money you have a problem with initial distribution of it, I guess.


Look, Kocherlakota has mathematically rigorous proofs... I really don't think that hand-wavy explanation of why Bitcoin works is better in any sense, we already know it does.
There is an obvious problem: volatility. We do not have equilibrium situation yet (LOL), so prices change all the time, and this messes up allocation.

I agree with most of your points, but just want to clarify some things:


I disagree.  It isn't hard to predict that wallet software and exchanges will improve over time if there is any activity around Bitcoin at all.
Remember that when investors consider buying a stock, they look at forward P/E estimates, not at current P/E.
Particularly, it takes years for oil &amp; gas companies to go from exploration to production, but they need billions  of dollars to do proper exploration, drill, etc. So investors absolutely need to look into future, as these companies have no revenue for years.
So trying to estimate what Bitcoin will be worth in future from current state is just wrong. If you're rational long-term investor, you should look at trajectory.
However, I think it's pretty obvious that Bitcoin price on market is driven by hype and exchange mechanics. Market isn't efficient and majority of investors are not rational/well-informed.
I think a rational investor will come to conclusion that there is
 * high risk (there is always a possibility that it will crash due to inherent flaw or action of governments)
 * very strong upward trend
 * very high volatility

It depends on what we're protecting it against.
First let's consider protection against double-spending. Take a look at [Analysis of hashrate-based double-spending]( by Meni Rosenfeld: as it turns out, it's possible to calculate maximum safe transaction for a given attacker's hashrate and number of confirmations: if transaction is bigger than that, attack has positive expected value.
If attacker has 30% of total hashrate, max safe transaction is 539 BTC at 6 confirmations and 1435 BTC at 10 confirmations. When block reward will drop, max safe transaction value will also drop.
Absolute total hashrate helps to make sure that attacker isn't able to recruit hashrate temporarily (say, by launching Amazon EC2 instances), and ASIC miners definitely protect against it: there is no way to rent them to do an attack, and they absolutely dwarf hashrate of general-purpose supercomputers and clouds.
But you also need to consider protection against hostile takeover.
Suppose there is a corporation with a market cap of $10 billion whose business is threatened by Bitcoin. Suppose it can raise $100M in cash (diluting existing shareholders by 1%, it's almost negligible) to buy a lot of ASIC mining hardware. (It's cheap when bought in bulk, so $100M might be enough to get 50% hashrate.)
Then: mine bitcoins, sell them on market, start attacking the network with double-spending and 51% blockade. Confidence in Bitcoin plummets, business is saved.
It is possible to "take over" Bitcoin by paying only a fraction of its market cap, so I think we aren't overpaying, we need a lot of hardware to make sure that Bitcoin stays secure.
Now let's go back to the problem: suppose you have hired a lot of mercenaries to protect your city. You pay them way above living expenses, and so they are very interested in protecting your city, city is safe.
But then, one day, you decide that you're overpaying for protection and cut their salaries in two. They no longer cover living expenses.
What happens next?
Well, perhaps some of mercenaries are frugal, honest, or are interested in protecting the city because they already bought a house in it. They will keep protecting it.
However, other mercenaries might resort to doing something nefarious at nights to make ends meet... And, perhaps, a large fraction of them will be hired by rivals to attack your city. It is no longer safe.
My point is, safety is definitely not a linear function of 'mining power', economics of it is much more complex.

You're right, what I've written above makes no sense.
To attack this, one needs to attack all three layers (RIPEMD-160, SHA-256 and ECDSA) at the same time.
On the other hand, if SHA-256 is broken, you can try to replace transaction itself. When somebody spends coins, he signs hash of transaction. Now you can make a different transaction with same hash, then it will be a valid spend too.
It is also possible to change transactions which are already in blockchain, but that will only affect new nodes.

I disagree: blockchain.info wallet (for example) is very easy to use, it is easier than PayPal and online banking.


Yes, I totally agree... Bitcoin is essentially useless if you want to use it instead of a credit card.

Bitcoins are sent to an address controlled by OSE server. This server doesn't simply interpret the blockchain, it processes all payments.
Can you just read the document again? Which part of it you failed to understand?
Essentially it is same as 'direct shares' method, except that it is automatized.

It was _relayed_ by BitMinter. That means that BitMinter got it from somebody else and relayed it to others.
This can happen if miner who created block isn't directly connected to blockchain.info.
BitMinter likely runs a well-connected node, while botnet miner doesn't.

Yes, trade-off is that one cannot choose name he wants.
[People say]( names cannot at the same time be human-meaningful, decentralized and secure.
This isn't exactly true because Namecoin solves this, but the approach taken by Namecoin would create performance problems for lightweight clients.
And a better version of Namecoin which would work well with lightweight clients (allowing fast queries) is kinda hard to implement, will require a separate mined chain etc.
So instead of this we have to sacrifice meaningfulness.
However, I think it can work fairly well because identifier can be small, like 32-bit small. This means we needs just three words if we use Electrum-style mnemonics.
If it's a problem, we can make ID-to-name mapping ambiguous. It would require four-word names, but you can choose among 1600 variants. Quite possibly one of this variants makes sense. If it doesn't, you can "roll the dice" again...
Or, maybe, three words, but less variants to choose from.
Process is fairly straightforward: to register a name, you make transaction with public key you want to use (i.e. send bitcoin to yourself), once it is included into blockchain its location in blockchain can be encoded as a number. (A scheme which uses least possible number of bits is fairly contrived, but isn't hard to implement.) Then this number is converted into words using mnemonics table. Many different word combinations correspond to a single number.
Client does the opposite thing: it gets a name, converts it to a number and then finds specific transaction in blockchain and extracts public key from it.
Alternatively, client might just receive information that proves that name corresponds to a public name (a block header and Merkle branches which link transaction containing public key to that block header), so it won't need to do any queries. (It only needs to check that block header is a part of the main chain.)

Well, I'm sure when somebody mentioned that Bitcoin market cap will be above 1 billion USD people also considered it pie in the sky and laughed, but it is a fact now.
Also I bet people laughed when somebody mentioned that Internet will be ubiquitous...
It is just hard to see how big changes are possible. But nevertheless, they happen all the time. Sure, not all predictions are true...
Anyway, is that possible that 1% of wealth hidden offshore will be converted into cryptocurrency?
I don't see why not. Wealthy people want diverse portfolios, and extreme volatility of Bitcoin shouldn't scare them off since it isn't a problem to invest 1% into a risky asset.
Don't forget that stocks are extremely risky too. Do you think it's safe to buy shares of Bear Stearns, one of largest investment banks? Those guys are very money-savvy, they will surely know how to keep safe.
But nope, shares lost 95% of their value in two days.
I would argue that this cannot happen to Bitcoin: Bitcoin is not leveraged, so its value cannot suddenly go to zero. It is traded in a decentralized way, so there is always somebody willing to buy Bitcoin.
Anyway, risk is not why people do not diversify into Bitcoin.
So what we see:
 * high risk
 * potentially high upside
 * you do not need to depend on offshore trusts, holding and shell companies to hold Bitcoins, 
However, there are problems:
 * not perceived as a serious investment yet
 * might be hard to buy in large quantities
 * market cap is way to small for uses we are talking about
 * it isn't clear whether it would be easy to spend or withdraw when needed
 * vulnerable to cyber attacks
So we see why it isn't the case yet, but situation is improving: 
 * Bitcoin exchanges start to work with regulators, more exchanges appear, etc.
 * Bitcoin ETFs and other products are created, this helps with legitimacy
 * market cap is increasing
 * we see more businesses accepting Bitcoins
 * with hardware wallets and whatnot, we'll get to secure and convenient way to store Bitcoins
So I don't see why it cannot happen.
Your counter-argument is like recursive ad hominem: "Your projects aren't credible because you aren't credible because I don't believe what you're saying and I don't think it's credible".
Do you have any serious counter-arguments?


A lot of people talking about bitcoins are newbies and amateurs. But that doesn't mean that what they say is entirely meaningless. Sometimes it is, but sometimes even a wild projection sort of makes sense.
Keep in mind that at early enthusiasts were newbies and amateurs, and they paved the way for Bitcoin to be considered more seriously.
They are part of community, and they deserve way more credit than professional traders, economists, investors and cryptographers, whose criticism did not help at all. 
And now you want to distance from people who helped to bootstrap the system.

I understand you, but it looks like the Chinese are buying bitcoins to own them. They are much sensitive to small price fluctuations, so I assume that proportion of daytraders on Chinese exchanges is much smaller.
It makes sense to cash out into USD because USD is relatively stable and has a long history, but apparently cashing out into CNY isn't a good idea. What are they going to do with it anyway, buy overpriced real estate? They already know that real estate is overpriced, but whether Bitcoin is overpriced is a question.

Well, there is still a difference: ASICs are optimal for Bitcoin mining and soon GPUs will be obsolete. But there are no Litecoin ASICs, and it's unlikely there will ever be because they don't give such a huge advantage.

Well, it's possible to implement a Bitcoin-like currency where miners will get all coins which haven't moved for some time. E.g. one will have to "refresh" his coins each 10 years, or else he loses it.
This kinda makes sense... There is less uncertainty about "ancient coins", mining is subsidized so we get better security than otherwise, people will have to pay storage fee (fee for refresh). 
Too bad goldbugs think it's absolutely their right to save coins for thousands of years without paying anything... So they won't let it happen.

I expect it will stabilize around $1000/BTC.
Let's say 1 of 100 Europeans will be concerned about safety of their bank deposits, and will convert some fraction fo their wealth into Bitcoins.

Right now we have a free market: each miner can choose his own policy. You want it to be "standardized", but who is going to standardize it?

Look, dude, I develop Bitcoin wallet software for living, I know a bit or two more about this than you do. If you do not understand something just re-read my comments until you do. Or go to Bitcoin wiki and learn how transactions actually work.


This is exactly the scenario I'm talking about, but it is called digital signature, not encryption.
ECDSA: eliptic curve digital signature algorithm.
This is the most important piece of Bitcoin crypto.


Actually, not quite... The thing is, address is a hash of a public key, and public key isn't revealed until you send a transaction. This means that even if ECDSA is broken, you're money is intact if you never made a transaction with that address.
However, somebody can find you private key as soon as he sees your spending transaction. So the only way to recover to this is to establish some encrypted channel to send transaction directly to miners. Then if miners are honest, they will include transactions into blocks without revealing them... And once transaction is in block, thief cannot double-spend it.
So, basically, a coalition of honest miners can save the day.

Ripple.com says that it is "The world's first open payment network".
Now recall that Bitcoin's value is mainly in its utility as a payment system: Bitcoin allows people to send money to anybody in the world, securely and without any bureaucracy. This is why people want to buy Bitcoins. (As a thought experiment, compare Bitcoin to its copycats: technology is exactly the same, but Bitcoin is much more valuable. Why?)
Now Ripple is also a crypto-based payment network...  With some interesting features Bitcoin doesn't have.
If Ripple actually works as advertised, there will be much smaller incentive to use Bitcoin for payments. So Bitcoin can appear in same situation as alt-chains appear now

As a mathematician I can tell you that there is no inherent value in Primecoin's proof-of-work just like there is no inherent value in Bitcoin's hashing.
Perhaps there is some vague chance that Primecoin will help to formulate and prove some number-theoretic theorem. 
But you can also say that Bitcoin helps with cryptoanalysis of SHA-256. In some way.
So there is no significant difference, and thus Primecoins doesn't have any benefits.
It is just a marketing ploy.
Perhaps you can see it as a proof-of-concept, and in future we'll have alt-coins which actually do something useful, like protein folding, I dunno. But that doesn't make prime numbers mining useful.

Private blockchains are based on different assumptions.
First, let's note that nothing is 100% "immutable". Bitcoin's transaction irreversibility might fail due to a 51% attack, a bug in the code, miners' collusion, etc.
And this already happened several times. In [2010 a transaction was reversed]( after 53 confirmations. In 2013 a transaction was reversed after ~6 confirmations.
So Bitcoin transactions are irreversible only under certain assumptions, e.g. we need to assume that miners are rational, act independently, don't have an external source of income etc. And, of course, we have to assume that code has no bugs.
So guess what, private blockchain security is based on _different_ assumptions. [E.g.](
But I don't think you should be worried about private blockchains, they generally have different goals and aren't really competing with Bitcoin.

Wrong. You can connect to many nodes at once, and send version A to a half of them, version B to other half. Then, if these transactions are similar and one of them is included into the next block, it will be A with a probability 50%.
If A was send-to-self, your double-spending will be successful with a probability of 50%.

No. You only consider one specific attack, where attacker buys hashing power to perform an attack. But there are many other ways attack can happen:
1. A bug in software. For example, bug causing network split.
2. Attack on Bitcoin network. You can try to split it, isolate specific nodes, shut down miners through network-level DoS etc.
3. Hijack servers which belong to miners or mining pools to get significant amount of hashing power.
4. Steal mining hardware or hashpower, possibly though use of violence or coercion.
5. It is always possible that somebody having much less than 50% of hashing power can perform a successful attack.
E.g. consider a scenario where Chinese government seizes ASICMINER hardware, thus getting 20% of hashing power. According to Meni Rosenfeld, this means 2% probability of 6-confirmation double-spend.
Then they can DDoS Bitcoin mining pools and, maybe, just nodes, to reduce hashrate of the rest of the network, thus increasing their chances to win.
Another way to attack:
1. Create several new mining pools, with low fees and otherwise attractive. Advertise them heavily.
2. You can get significant percentage of hashing power this way.
3. Now DDoS the shit out of other mining pools and Bitcoin nodes.
4. Miners switch to your mining pools.
5. You can perform double-spends.
If you have more than one pool it is fairly easy to disguise an attack: you can always blame it on problems with connectivity.

I don't see how is it even related. Do you call any exponential growth "Moore's law"?
Increase in difficulty isn't in any way related to technology, it is just pre-ordered mining devices being delivered.

Well, with namecoin the idea is to create a name per share. So, 1 million shares = 1 million names. It pollutes the blockchain...
On the other hand, colored coins allow you to represent 1 million shares in just one transaction output.
But while we are at it (it is unrelated to colored coins/stocks/etc), Namecoin fundamentally doesn't support thin clients. Client needs to scan full blockchain to watch new name registration, updates and transfers. It pretty much ruins the concept.
If it could support thin clients you could implement namecoin-based name resolvers in browsers, routers, thin wallets. It could become an ubiquitous... Fully decentralized replacement for SSL.
But you do not want to scan multi-gigabyte blockchain in a browser extension, do you?
Namecoin implementation is too fucking simple. It simply goes through all transactions, looking for a specific patterns in scripts and updates name database.
It is good for a proof-of-concept, but it's simply not ready for real world use.
It isn't to hard to implement a namecoin-like system which would support thin clients: one just needs to reference a name search tree from each block. Then thin clients only need to know last block, and having it they can traverse search tree and find name.

 * a secure RNG to generate passphrase with enough bits of entropy
 * trustworthy software which cannot be tampered with
 * in a secure environment

Situation in Japan, for example.


It is absolutely different thing: these countries have to borrow in foreign currency.
I have first-hand experience of hyperinflation: I've been living in Ukraine in 90s when there was hyperinflation.
And I live in Ukraine now, in a country which had serious problems with inflation in 2000s.
I know how it works. I know how government desperately tries to prop up local currency, pegging it to dollar, at the same time borrowing with an exorbitant interest rates. I know how government lies, I know their tricks.
If you live in such a country and you're interested in macroeconomics, you have _a lot_ of food for the thought. It is basically as if there was some new economic experiment each month.
Government is desperate, old tricks stop working at some point, so they have to invent new ones.
So all in all, I have first-hand experience, and you only know about it from some shitty blogs. Do not lecture me.
It matters a lot whether currency has a debt denominated in foreign currency.
This is why USA and Japan can easily sustain debt on scale of 100%-200% of GDP, while a country like Ukraine is crippled when debt is only 50% of GDP.
Investors know that USA and Japan are in control of its currency and debt, so these countries can borrow at 1%. And investors know that Ukraine isn't in control, that's why nobody wants it debt even at 10% per year, it's a gamble.

Well, let's start with the fact that you never were anonymous to begin with: because other nodes can infer who are you from transactions you submit. Sure, you relay transactions for others, but nodes can monitor not-previously-seen transactions which come from your node.
You need to inject your transaction into the network somehow, and at that point of injection people will notice you.
However, it doesn't matter much because you can inject transaction via Tor or other anonymizing network.
Now it isn't different for transaction lookups: transaction info can be stored in a DHT, so, basically, you can just fetch data from that DHT via some kind of anonymizing network.
So what we see is that looking up transactions is at least as anonymous as sending transactions.
It looks like you want tx lookups to be _more_ anonymous than tx sends. But why?
What's the value of looking whether you own money when you can't spend that money?
It really looks like you're nitpicking.

The difference is that atomic coin swapping is already implemented, while cross-chain transaction cannot be implemented now.


They are 100% different, please stop spreading this misinformation.
Namecoin works via tx output scripts of a special form: instead of defining how coins can be spent, script defines what name should be registered. When client sees this script it updates its name database.
Colored coin protocol DOES NOT add any additional information into blockchain. Colored coin transactions look exactly like Bitcoin transaction.
Colored coin client uses external color definition to track transfers of colored coins within normal Bitcoin transactions.
Basically, colored coins are not real, they are hallucinations of color-aware client.
If color definition is lost, there is no way to say whether transaction involved colored coins or not.


It is entirely different technology, built for an entirely different purpose. There is overlap in possible use cases, but it's tiny.


Well, yes, it makes sense. Namecoin blockchain has extra information which adds to the bloat, but colored coin protocol does not embed any extra information.

Eh... It often takes days to transfer "real money".
If you mean credit cards, they work so fast because banks agreed that they will register transactions now, but transfer "real money" later. You can do same with Bitcoin...
Anyway, waiting 15 minutes instead of a hour to transfer your money is kinda nice. 15 minutes is "I'll drink coffee and it would be there", but with 1 hour delay I have to switch to something different...
And I'd say 6 confirmations is too much for most applications. 2 confirmations is enough to guard against all race attacks, and it is 5 minutes vs 20 minutes.

Can you explain why miners don't yet implement replace-by-fee policy: if new transaction (with different outputs) pays higher fee, it can replace transaction which is already in the memory pool and has same inputs?
That would make zero-confirmation double-spending trivial and it increases fees which miners receive.
@_date: 2013-03-25 23:03:38
No. Bitcoin mining can be seen as a [Poisson process]( statistically, hence time between blocks random variable has [exponential distribution]( with mean 10 minutes.
Exponential distribution is memoryless, thus waiting time is also exponentially distributed with mean 10 minutes. It doesn't matter how much you have waited and how much time passed since last block, average waiting time is always 10 minutes.

Normally 1 share is represented with 1 satoshi. If one share is less valuable than 0.00000001 BTC then I guess stock is worthless and satoshi constituting shares can be recycled.
But if bitcoin becomes so valuable that 1 satoshi is a considerable sum of money, we can simply say that price 1 colored satoshi is price of 1 satoshi + price of security it represents.


You can re-issue colored coins with different parameters, then ask people to swap old ones for new ones.
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:41:03
But I think it would be nice if "ordinary people" will buy some small amounts of Bitcoins. Why?
From what I see, currently large amounts of Bitcoins are bought by wealthy individuals (pro traders, investors...). That's how we got from $13 to $130. And  this process will likely get accelerated once coinlab will start functioning as advertised.
So in the end large amount of Bitcoins will be owned by some early adopters who believe that Bitcoin is the future of money and thus refuse to "cash out"; and by wealthy guys, corporations and institutions.
This will make Bitcoin relatively fragile and not particularly attractive to ordinary users who will be late at the party.
Now suppose some "ordinary people" will buy like $100 worth of Bitcoins each, withdraw it to paper wallet stored in a secure place and won't touch it for a year or two.
Then they will notice that Bitcoins they own are now worth something, and I presume that by that time we will figure out how to store Bitcoins securely, and adoption on the business side will get wider... So these people will be able to spend their Bitcoins, stimulating Bitcoin economy.
Interestingly, if there is no intention to spend Bitcoins right away or to gamble on price, slow purchase methods might be used, like shipping a voucher or a physical coin in mail, paid with a credit card. (Transfer to a paper wallet might be a problem security-wise, though.)

$130 sounds like too much and you can't understand that you can buy less than one Bitcoin? OK, you won't be an early adopter, you don't deserve it.

CEO of OpenCoin said that Ripple is going to be "a second generation of Bitcoin". WTF.
Doesn't that mean that Bitcoin and Ripple are now at war? Essentially they are trying to supersede Bitcoin.
While we are at it, colored coins allow people to create private currencies to live inside the Bitcoin network, with capabilities more-or-less matching capabilities of Ripple, at least in theory. If colored coins will be in use, Ripple and Bitcoin will be roughly comparable both as payment networks and as currencies (native currencies -- BTC and XRP -- are free of counter-party risk, and thus are in privileged position).

"Turing complete" is an abstraction. When applied to a concrete system, what people usually mean by that is that such a system can run arbitrary computations. And this is true for Ethereum.
Your computer isn't Turing complete either in a true sense of the world, as it has finite memory. But as long as a computation fits into memory, it can run arbitrary computation, so it's said to be Turing complete.
You can run arbitrary computations on Ethereum. To do that you might need to call some function, let's say `run()` multiple times -- in multiple transactions and blocks.

It isn't a knock-off of namecoin, it works in a considerably different way.

@_date: 2013-08-15 21:59:31
Well, we know that centralized exchanges like btct.co, mtgox.com do exist.
Crypto-based tech like colored coins can work in exactly same way, except that it uses different means to represent ownership. I.e. instead of a proprietary database like one mtgox.com uses, you'll have ownership data stored in a public ledger. (I.e. bitcoin blockchain.)
While it is possible that it creates new legal problems, it is likely superior to centralized solution. Because in the worst case you can simply use a centralized exchange on top of colored coin backend, so for external observers it will look like centralized exchange.


If we compare MasterCoin to colored coins, the difference is that colored coin tech:
 * is simpler
 * and thus more robust
 * makes secure thin clients possible, while with MasterCoin thin clients have to trust server
Also colored coin client software already exists and actually works. IIRC there are four implementations.
It is just that this software isn't ready to be used on the mainnet, so we are improving it now.
But you can try WebcoinX on testnet right now. You can send and receive, issue your own coins, trade coins on market via p2ptrade.
So let's summarize: MasterCoin is a different thing; protocol it uses is in many ways inferior (it is just my opinion, of course); it has no wallet implementation, while colored coin wallet implementations already exist.

You're missing the fact that true distribution of commodity price is not known. There is simply no way to know it precisely outside of artificial settings.
Such distribution needs to be estimated, for example, using statistical methods.
E.g. suppose we have a model which predicts that commodity price at some point of time in future will have mean k. Suppose we can estimate k from some sample, and it falls into interval [0.5, 1.5] at confidence level 95%, with mean being 1.
Suppose current price of such commodity is 0.9. Investor sees positive EV and buys such commodity.
However, true EV (EV based on real price distribution, as opposed to EV based on distribution assumed by investor) might be negative, in this case investor loses money.
I think that's what coelomate meant.
Maybe we use framework and terminology different from what is typically used when comparing investment strategies. But, honestly, I'm not ashamed of that: I see that very often people who work in narrow fields just stick to some methodology and apply it blindly, never re-considering assumptions it depends on.

Let's start with the fact that we already had 50% of hashing power in one hands. This isn't what Satoshi have expected, he thought it won't exceed 10% or so.
In theory it have already failed. It is just that nobody actually bothered to attack. But can we depend on that?
You know, centralized digital currencies also work... until they don't.
If this kind of mining failed, isn't it a good idea to try something else?

Not really, Lee just copied it from Tenebrix.
Anyway, choice of hashing algorithm used for mining is a matter of preference, it's not a feature of cryptocurrency itself, so it doesn't count as an innovation.


It's not about security: it was supposed to prevent GPU mining, but it didn't because chosen parameters are too optimistic. (Dude who created it, ArtForz, prioritized low overhead of CPU mining.)

Right now price of ASIC equipment dwarfs electricity costs associated with mining, but when market will be saturated with the most efficient hardware (I think it will happen in 2014), electricity costs will be a significant fraction of the value of mined bitcoins...

Single thread can't be a problem per se, because CPU does billions of operations per second, and so it is theoretically possible to process a lot of trades using just one thread. Most likely, though, it is bottlenecked in I/O.
For example, doing one or more SQL queries for each trade would certainly slow it down. For example, when sell order arrives we do the following:
1. fetch highest bid
2. if it matches with our sell order, fill it, update db and go to 1.
3. save leftover of sell order in ask table.
I can tell it works this way because in that epic fail in summer of 2011 it was filling one sell order for a couple of hours. And people were able to submit more orders while it was being filled... (Sure, they told us they have rewritten their software since then, but something tells me new software is based on same kind of approach.)
But even if you do two SQL queries per fill you should be able to process, maybe, 100 fills per second. But that's not a rate mtgox deals with...
E.g. here:  you see what, dozen of trades per minute? And it periodically reports "mtgox engine lag" on scale of minutes.
I decided to get data directly from mtgox, using API: 
Description says it should give me 24h worth of trading data, but it gave me data for one hour only. Still if this data is correct, they have processed ~1600 trades per hour. Even if it was a slow hour, they must have a lot of headroom.

Well... What's about setting up full reserve banking as an option?
With fractional reserve banking, bank lends your money. It is good when bank shares with you.
But when it doesn't (you get 0% interest), full reserve can work as well. Government just needs to set it up in such way that full reserve accounts won't be affected when banks go under, _they should not be considered bank's assets_.
A possible downside is that full reserve will probably cost you a lot in fees... But at least you have option to be safe.

Ideas like this one are posted to bitcointalk forum pretty much each week. 
Some of them have a merit, i.e. it is technically possible to implement something like this.
But the thing is, backward-incompatible changes to Bitcoin protocol are avoided at all cost. So this just won't happen.
It is possible to implement "cheap &amp; fast microtransactions" without changes to Bitcoin protocol, under condition that some degree of centralization is acceptable. So it will be done that way.

Actually what matters is how many of coins are dumped on market and what's market's capacity to absorb them.
What's interesting, many of these ASIC miners were bought for Bitcoins, and so people will be interested in getting their Bitcoins back, not in selling them on market. Particularly, ASICminer shares: you buy them for Bitcoin, you get Bitcoins as dividends...
So, I guess, only a fraction of Bitcoins is dumped on market.
In any case, you cannot really do anything with this number if you don't know inflow/outflow of fiat money on Bitcoin exchanges, reserves etc.

I wanted to write a lengthy article about it today, but...
On a very basic level, we can model current Bitcoin price as p*X, where p is probability of 'success' and X is price of one Bitcoin in case of that success. (Yes, it should be expected value, but I said "on a very basic level".)
I believe X is _at least_ $1000. Let's assume X = 1000, it is a conservative estimate.
At price 100 USD per Bitcoin we have p=0.1.
At price 140 USD per Bitcoin we have p=0.14.
Well, this probability is arbitrary as fuck, different people have different estimates. So let's say there are people who have p=0.5.
What does it mean? We should be wondering why price didn't go to 200 or 300.
Exponential growth isn't the right model at this time. Growth measured in percentage makes little sense.
On the other hand, I think it will plateau before we get to $10000, as usage need to catch up with price to continue.

People who manufacture ASIC equipment themselves will make money.


Why do you think you need to mine?
From economic perspective, mining is similar to arbitrage: when there is a disparity between equipment cost, electricity cost, difficulty and Bitcoin price, people do more mining and opportunity vanishes. But it isn't a true arbitrage as there is a delay.
There are many other way to earn bitcoins, so I do not understand this fixation on mining.

They can be seen a distributed companies. 
And, yes, they are networks too. VISA and Mastercard each has its own network.


The fact, huh? Have you considered all possible situations?
1. Bitcoin hits block size limit, higher fees are required to get into block.
2. When block reward blocks, Bitcoin miners have to rely on fees. How many of them can survive drop from 25 BTC per block to 12.5 BTC per block when their margins will be very thin due to increasing difficulty?
3. Collusion between large Bitcoin mining pools.
In all three cases, Litecoin offers an alternative. Litecoin miners and Bitcoin miners are different groups of people (you don't need special hardware to mine Litecoins), Litecoin devs are not Bitcoin devs (yes, they do exist).


This is one-time cost, likely negligible (you just use payment processor which supports them all).
While benefits of having an alternative are permanent.

But XRP are understood to be valuable as they are necessary to transact on Ripple.com. If some guy just creates some worthless tokens for himself, they will have 0 value and he won't be able to use them.


It is fair in sense that it is automatic and impartial process. Everybody had a chance to mine them, so nobody should complain.
But this is about marketing...


Yes, we still need to reward mining. Without that Bitcoin security will be laughable and it would be relatively easy to attack it. Who needs money which are unreliable?
16 years from now mining reward will be only 1.5 BTC per block. Miners will likely have to depend on fees. But if Bitcoin catches on transaction volume will be much higher than what we have now. If it doesn't catch on, then mining reward is irrelevant.
@_date: 2013-11-04 12:11:36
You forget that there are many cryptocurrencies now, particularly there are cryptocurrencies which can be merged-mined with Bitcoin.
Merged mining allows one to make decisions about attacks independently. Suppose I'm merged-mining Bitcoin and Namecoin. I can choose to perform this attack on Bitcoin, but not on Namecoin. Or attack Namecoin, but not Bitcoin.
I believe that merged mining is a bad idea for this reason. Miners' work is meant to be dedicated to a particular chain, if it's reused then it doesn't protect chains to same extent.

I bet 0.1 BTC that there is one server you need to hijack. It might sit behind firewall, but it doesn't matter much.

Well, we can see that coins which were mined in early blocks are not spent yet.
@_date: 2013-05-06 11:53:25
Previously you could send 1 satoshi as long as you pay a fee.
Now minimal amount one can send is a fraction of min tx relay fee. WIth a default min tx relay fee it is 5430 satoshi. To lower min spend to 1 satoshi miners will have to set mintxrelayfee much lower.
This represents difference in understanding economics of mining: previously we thought that blockchain space is valuable, so fee was supposed to cover use of blockchain space.
Now we think that UTXO set size is a very important factor. But instead of penalizing UTXO set size growth, this patch effectively tries to impose a soft limit on UTXO set size.
If mintxrelayfee stays at 0.0001 BTC and there are no rebel miners, UTXO set will be limited to ~386 billion entries.
If Bitcoin gets more valuable, mintxrelayfee will be sent lower, so UTXO set size can grow.
@_date: 2013-10-08 15:17:45
Yes, but:
1. It is sort of unnecessary, as Bitcoin itself is high-risk/high-reward kind of investment, and it is likely much less risky than any of "Bitcoin securities". So it makes sense to invest only if you enjoy trading/investing, and only a small fraction.
2. Most Bitcoin investment vehicles are tied to mining, and they tend to be mispriced: Bitcoin investors routinely overestimate profitability of these securities. Thus the only way to profit on them is to play on psychology of investors.
3. Market is very inefficient and you can make decent profit on daytrading/arbitrage. One of famous traders, Deprived, routinely gets 1% per week (which is nice), but previously his profits were ridiculous, like 5-10% per week, week after week.
4. There are few investment opportunities which can be good in the long term and aren't overpriced.
5. Number of scams/failures is actually surprisingly low. Say, out of three dozens securities registered on btct.co, only one was outright scam (LABCOIN).

Well, let's see. To do BTC-&gt;fiat you need:
1. Accept bitcoins.
2. send them to mtgox
3. sell them on mtgox
4. transfer fiat to your account
Bitcoin transfer will take at least 1 hour.
Also you keep fiat in mtgox account between withdrawals, so that's exposure to counterparty risk
1. accept fiat
2. buy bitcoins on mtgox
3. send them to person
In this case, there is no exposure to exchange rate risk, but you need to hold some money in mtgox account.
However, if you're the size of WU you probably can broken a special deal where you'll hold money in a bank account and transfer them to mtgox after the fact. In this case fiat-&gt;BTC is risk free, but BTC-&gt;fiat is not.

If block size limit will be set to 10 MB, much fewer people will be able to run full node... Increase it further, and only mining pools and professional payment processors will remain.
This will result in reduced decentralization.


You're wrong: these services can be as decentralized as Bitcoin nodes.
And this will actually result in increased privacy because of mixing: If you do payment through Bitcoin network directly, this transaction will be forever a part of Bitcoin transaction history, and thus available to anybody. There is no need to tag/report you, it's already there.
However, if payment goes through aggregator, only it knows correspondence between inputs and outputs. Moreover, it is possible to combine aggregation and mixing to make payments 100% anonymous.
So again, Bitcoin is a good protocol for large-scale settlements/payments, but not for individual small payments... Off-chain systems will be ab improvement both in terms of efficiency and in terms of privacy/anonymity.

Well, retep had this concept of fidelity bond...
The idea is that some amount of coins needs to be sacrificed to create a token which represents reputation. It is tradeable. If person who owns it violates the rules, token becomes worthless, he can't sell it anymore. This creates an economic incentive to play by rules.
E.g. if 1 BTC went into creation of a token, and I can scam somebody for 0.5 BTC, it's not worth it.
If token isn't tradeable, then there is no such incentive. E.g. suppose I paid 1 BTC for access to service Foo, but I'm not interested in it anymore. It makes sense to scam Foo for 0.5 BTC because I won't lose anything of value: 1 BTC is sunk cost, I cannot get it back if token isn't tradeable.
So tradeability is a big deal.

Kinda. Suppose mtgox and bitpay switched to Bitcoin 2.0 protocol, which is slightly different from Bitcoin. You have choice:
 * stay on old protocol and transact with like-minded people
 * switch to new protocol to be able to spend your Bitcoins on goods and exchange them into USD at a favorable rate
What do you choose?
Sure, some "wise men" will stay on old protocol, but majority of users will simply follow one which has better exchange rate (=better acceptance).

FWIW I've outlined a way how to implement a secure and anonymous prediction market using colored bitcoins: 
@_date: 2013-04-24 22:47:16


The difference is that attacker will publish information about retrieving data from it. After that you will know that there is illegal information in blockchain and you will be aware of a way to retrieve it.
So then we'll need some way to prune this information out of blockchain, which isn't easy...


Let's pray it will only be a thought experiment... Something tells me that we'll see it in practice.

Volatility is not cause by HFT, it is caused by uncertainty about adoption growth.
Suppose adoption grows 10x, in theory price should grow too. But nobody can estimate how fast adoption grows, and different estimates clash together so you see a lot of volatility.
Once adoption growth rate stabilize you'll see much less volatility.
I predict that will happen within a month or two.

Your client will say that it isn't a valid address.
Well, what happens if you use Litecoin address in Bitcoin client? Bitcoin client will say that it isn't a valid address. 
But transactions are exactly the same. In theory you can get a Litecoin address, extract a public key hash from it and make a Bitcoin address, and send coins to it. Then dude can extract private key from his Litecoin client, put it into a Bitcoin client and receive coins.
Addresses are just prefixed with version numbers to avoid confusion, but under the hood they are identical.

Those things are cheap, they have 2.5G connectivity and it is possible to implement a wallet in J2ME.
Pretty much all attack vectors can be eliminated if user will abstain from installing other apps, browsing internet and so on on this device.

The problem with it is that at some point miners can make it trivial to double-spend...  Memory pool rules which prevent double-spending are not enforced in any way, it just happens that miners prefer using the reference Bitcoin node implementation, but we cannot depend on it... It's better to find a reliable solution for instantaneous transaction confirmation.

There are thousands of people who provide hashrate ("miners"). All they care about is payouts, so they direct their hashrate at dozen or so mining pools.
Mining pools cannot stop people from hashing: if mining pool will intentionally stop producing blocks, people will switch to a different pool.
(In old time there were no mining pools and miners were able to create blocks directly.)

There are different attack models. Meni's paper covers only one of them.


This is another attack model. It implies that attacker is able to get more than 50% of total haspower. In case with Bitcoin, it is just not realistic.
If attacker has enough hardware to have more than 50% of hashpower, he just owns the network. Energy is nearly irrelevant.
If attacker doesn't have enough hardware, attack is probabilistic, and then its success depends on number of number of confirmations. Energy is a secondary concern.
It is possible to describe model which takes into account both energy costs and available hardware. I did this. In the end you get a huge-ass formula.
What we get from it is that model which only takes into account amount of energy is too simple.


You assume that capital costs are trivial, but they are not. To do a 50% attack, you need to overpower the rest of the network.
You need to buy LOTS of hardware. Like, you buy $100,000,000 worth of hardware, and then spend $1000 on energy.
So, again, why do you focus on energy? It's just not realistic to assume that attacker owns all hardware in the world.


Nobody says that Litecoin is more protected, it just gives faster confirmations.
_All being equal_, faster confirmations make it more secure against attacks where attacker is unable to get more than 50% of hashpower.

The difference is that Bitcoin devs do not want this. So we will likely see it in alt-coin first.
Basically it is already possible to insert comments into Bitcoin transactions via OP_DROP thing, but it is blocked on the mainnet, and devs do not want to unblock it even though some people ask for it.
So the difference is in attitude. Alt-coin devs are more open to experiments and want cool features.
@_date: 2013-05-27 12:36:53
Yes, it is acceptable now because double-spending is hard and rare.
However, in theory miners can adopt replace-by-fee patch (nothing prevents them from doing it), and then double-spending might be pretty much trivial if it is integrated with client. So it is possible that zeroconf double-spends will be an usual thing and precautions will be necessary.
We are discussing cryptocurrency design now so I think theoretical aspects are important...

1. He can make it so only he gets fresh Bitcoins and all transaction fees. Other miners get nothing. It makes no sense to mine anymore.
2. Double-spending: Attacker can unwind any transaction, his own or on request. You  no longer can depend on transactions being final after ~6 confirmations. E.g. somebody can pay you money, you see it in your wallet for a hour... And then it disappears.
3. Blockade: Attacker won't include some transactions into blockchain. As long as blockade continues, you cannot do anything with your coins. (Unless people you pay to trust you, but that means you don't even need cryptocurrency.)
4. He can mine empty blocks. Nobody's transactions will be confirmed as this goes on.

Well, there are transaction replacement rules: 
You can rely on them ONLY if there are no miners who would implement different transaction replacement rules.
Miners can use any rules for choosing transactions for inclusion into blocks, there is no penalty for alternative rules. And, say, replace-by-fee rule would maximize miner's profit.
In other words, you can rely on transaction replacement rules only as long as miners value honoring rules described in the default client more than they value their profit.
Mike Hearn and others mentioned proposals to change block validity rules in such a way that miners who help to double-spend will be penalized. But these proposals never materialized into anything concrete.

Sorry, but this is very different from colored coins, it is more like Mastercoin.
Colored coins, by definition, must fit within this theoretic model: 
That is, it works on transaction output level (transaction outputs are colloquially called coins, hence the name: we are associating special properties with transaction outputs = coloring coins). 
If you aren't using transaction graph then your protocol has different properties. For example, it cannot be used with SPV.

What's about this:  ?
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:50:52
There are several different attack models:
1. Attacker has more than 50% of hashpower: in this case he can do whatever he wants to, number of confirmations is irrelevant.
2. Attacker temporarily acquires hashpower to do a reorganization (for example, he might rent it from cloud computing service): in this case number of blocks per unit of time is nearly irrelevant, only total amount of computations 'backing' a block is. However, this attack is nearly irrelevant in case of Bitcoin, as specialized devices are required to mine efficiently, and people don't just rent them to strangers.
3. Probablistic attack: attacker has less than 50% of hashpower, but he might be able to mine N blocks in a row by chance. In this case what matters is _number of confirmations_ (which is explained in Meni Rosenfeld's paper on double-spending), but of you take into account attacker's costs,  formula can be complex.
To summarize, all being equal, a network with higher number of blocks per unit of time is stronger against probabilistic attacks where attacker has only a small fraction of hashpower.
Thus Litecoin's parameters are beneficial in this sense. (It's worth noting that smaller time between blocks leads to higher number of orphans which weakens security against double-spends. But we see that in practice number of orphans is low enough with 2.5 minute interblock interval, but it becomes a major concern in case of 0.5 minute interblock interval.)

Also, it is anticipated that Bitcoin price will either be very high ($10,000 to $1,000,000), or will go down to zero. It might sound cult-ish, but there is a sound logic behind these estimates.
The thing is, the current "market cap" -- about $3 billion -- is too small.
It is definitely an intermediate stage, it cannot last for long: Bitcoin will either grow and fill certain niches (in that case we expect much bigger "market cap"), or some hurdle will destroy it.
When price moves up, the becomes more likely that the first scenario comes true, and people get excited about that (even if own no bitcoins, surely it is an exciting to see how ~~prophesies~~ predictions come true).

Yes, Jeff Garzik says we need to reproduce these bugs "to avoid splitting the network", but I don't see why "splitting the network" would be such a big deal.
I believe Bitcoin software should just include some sanity checks like counter of orphaned blocks. If it sees something suspicious it should just enter panic mode.

Bitcoin is fast only in comparison to intl wire transfers, which take several days to clear.
So maybe colored coins won't be fast in the sense that trades are executed in less than 1 millisecond, but fast in the sense that you don't need lengthy preparation before you start trading: you don't need to open brokerage account, etc.
Also we can liken it to intl wire transfers: I guess buying stocks in foreign country isn't easy, while crypto-based trading solutions will know no borders.


Not really: you only need a communication medium to trade. I.e. you need to be able to exchange information with other people who want to trade.
People who want faster and more predictable trades will have to use a more centralized solution. ("Off-chain transactions.")

Note that even if you're downloading client from the official site, it DOES  NOT mean you're safe: somebody could have hijacked that official site. Perhaps by hijacking developer's laptop.
So to be safe I recommend following procedure:
1. Download client, but do not install it.
2. Wait a couple of days.
3. Check forums and other news sources, do they talk about site being hijacked?
4. Download client again and check it is exactly same as before.
5. Now you can install, it is probably safe.
It doesn't guard you against malicious developers or rootkit-style attacks where nobody will know about attack for some time.
So a better procedure is to build from source. Same as before, download a snapshot and wait a couple of days before building it.

    2040: 0.1953125
    2044: 0.09765625
Currently miners get about 0.2 BTC from fees, so it's obvious that fees will have much bigger role by 2040.
Another way to look at it is how many Bitcoins are left to mine:
    2012: 10.5 M
    2016: 5.25 M
    2020: 2.625 M (
    2024: 1.31 M
    2028: 0.656 M (96% of all bitcoins are mined out)
    2032: 0.328 M
    2036: 0.164 M
    2040: 82k
    2044: 41k (99.8% of all bitcoins are already mined out)
Feds currently have ~144336 bitcoins. In 2040, that will be more than amount of bitcoins to be mined in next 100 years (ignoring fees).
What does it mean? It means that at that point you have buy the whole mining industry for 144k. Things like efficiency, Bitcoin price and so on simply do not matter: miners simply cannot make more than 82k from block rewards, so it makes  sense to stop mining and sell hardware.
In other words, Feds or a large player will be able to buy all of Bitcoin mining at that point.
Of course, assumption that fees are insignificant isn't reasonable.
The conclusion we get from it is that fees will be a major factor which affects Bitcoin security before 2040. (I believe we will see much higher fees:generation ration in 2016.) They cannot be small because small fees means that somebody owning just 1% of all bitcoins will be able to buy out the whole mining industry.
 &gt; a single bitcoin will be worth so much and there will be so many transactions that even a small fee will suffice.
You forget that block size is finite, so Bitcoin transactions compete with other Bitcoin transactions, and so price of Bitcoin is largely irrelevant. What matters is transaction volume.
Also, see above: fees affect network security.

I don't know what do you mean by "self-sustained". ~25000 Bitcoins are mined each week, that's $3M at current exchange rate... This encourages people to invest more and more into ASIC miners, and so potential cost of attack also increases.


They are rules in Bitcoin client code. Of course, it is possible to change them in code and build your own client. But if it will be incompatible with other clients it won't have any effect on the network.
Now, if you can persuade everyone to switch to your client, you can change the rules. This is known as "hard-fork".
So Bitcoin rules exist as a consensus among all Bitcoin users.

Give it some time... USD is still doing really well, it has stable value, is widely accepted etc.
It only makes sense to switch to Bitcoin in cases where USD isn't doing well (e.g. due to regulatory problems), and that alone could be a huge piece of a pie.

No. Simplest way to do that is a race: send version A to 50% of nodes, send version B to other 50% of nodes. If receiving client is connect to just one node you have successful double-spend in 50% of cases.
But it can be countered by polling multiple nodes.
However, the real problem is that nodes have an incentive to accept double-spending tx if it has higher fees. So _in theory_  some nodes might be using replace-by-fee policy, then double-spend is a trivial matter.
I'm not aware of any nodes which use it now, but eventually fees will play a bigger role, so eventually they might

While such an attack is theoretically possible `*`, it needs to be targeted, since you do not want it to be detected. And if it is targeted, you have to deliver microcode to the target...
So it is just another kind of rootkit, basically... It doesn't changes much: if somebody can execute arbitrary code on your machine, you're already pwned.
And it probably makes more sense to inject a rootkit via BIOS. In any case, we are at mercy of people who built the computer, and this microcode attack is nothing new.
`*`: I don't think it can work in practice: Instruction decoder needs to decode 6 billion instructions per second, so it isn't like they can add arbitrarily complex logic to it. I don't think they can recognize certain patterns in code, only certain instructions. And PRNG doesn't use any unique instructions.

While bruteforce attack is statistically very costly, and thus not worth it, double-spending can happen under out-of-normal conditions, such as network split
In fact during the fork of March 2013 somebody pulled out a practical double-spend.
So no, Bitcoin is not immune to double-spending attacks, they are just very rare.

You can send money from USA to Sweden via PayPal. According to PayPal web site, it costs only 0.5 USD if you pay from bank account.
No matter how you call it, Coinbase still needs to perform exchange, so bid-ask spread and price fluctuations are involved. So it is inferior to PayPal.
Now if you want to send money from USA to Ukraine... You just can't do that via PayPal.
Why is that?
Providing service like that requires compliance with local laws, cooperation with banks etc. It is complex and expensive.
Ukraine has a population of ~45M (that's ~4.5 times more than in Sweden) and large IT outsourcing sector (it was in top 5 on popular freelancing site oDesk in 2011), as well as lot of people working abroad. Surely if PayPal would figure out how to provide service in Ukraine they'd have a lot of business, but they do not provide such service, so it must be hard or even impossible.
[Here's a list of countries which PayPal supports]( as you can see, they offer different services in different countries.
So let's summarize, if you transfer between countries which have regulations and banks friendly to electronic payment systems, _there is already_ a way to do personal transfers at low cost.
PayPal is a huge company whose core business is payments. If it haven't figured out how to do it, chances that a local coinbase analog cannot exist either, because this is basically similar.
Anyway, let's say you want to send money from USA to Ukraine via Bitcoin, what are the options?
You can do it via btc-e, which actually allows one to withdraw to Ukrainian bank account, in local currency or USD. But the fee is 6%. Oh.
So let's summarize, there ain't such thing as a free lunch. Bitcoin doesn't magically solves all money transfer problems.  In fact if you think more about it, it actually solves nothing. 
Let's consider an example: Suppose there is a company Coinbase-Ukraine which works in Urkaine. Because of a large IT outsourcing sector, there will be more people who want to withdraw USD than people who want to send. Coinbase-Ukraine cannot print USD, so it needs to get them from somewhere. That is, it needs to exchange Bitcoins to USD on a bigger exchange. And it will get USD through a banking system (wire transfer), there is simply no other way for large volume transfer.
Thus, in the end, if people want to withdraw fiat money, company needs to be able to move fiat money.
So process goes approximately like that: a person in USA deposits USD into Coinbase, wants to buy Bitcoin. Coinbase doesn't have excess of Bitcoins, so it sends USD wire to MtGox and gets Bitcoins. Then Bitcoin is sent to Coinbase-Ukraine. Now we have process in reverse: Bitcoin is deposited into MtGox, exchange is made, MtGox sends USD via bank wire to Coinbase-Ukraine, which then is able to give it to person to Ukraine.
So what we see MtGox is used as an intermediary to send US dollars. Can't Coinbase-USA just send USD wire to Coinbase-Ukraine? They can save on MtGox fees.
So I'm afraid you just haven't thought it through

I can tell you that attitude is entirely different. 
Bitcoin developers are very careful and serious people. They do not add features just because they can.
IIRC only one feature was added in 5 years (P2SH) Bitcoin exists, and it was added in a backward-compatible way.
Only a handful of bugs in protocol were fixed. What Satoshi implemented was pretty damn good.
It is a stark contrast with Mastercoin which is done in a very sloppy and haphazard way. Features are bolted on, nobody gives a fuck about security, etc.
Basically, Bitcoin was done by paranoid crypto nerds; Mastercoin is done by happy-go-luck software developers who just do it for money.
I hope Mastercoin project gets a bit more serious, they need to understand that security isn't a secondary concern.

When your computer is infected (virus/trojan/keylogger), attacker has full control over it and thus can display absolutely anything he wants.
Particularly, he can impersonate anybody and anything.
Two-factor authentication isn't effective at this point, as attacker can simply replace your address with his own address when you make a withdrawal request.
The only thing which can help at this point is authorization of all actions on a clean system...
Now let's note that your Windows PC which runs a lot of 3rd party software just isn't secure. Any application or plug-in you ever launched can result in breach of security (either because it has malicious component or because it is vulnerable to some sort of attack). And Microsoft itself doesn't have a good track record.
Adobe Flash is a notoriously insecure piece of shit, but you probably want to have it to be able to watch videos and whatnot.
So this means that you shouldn't do anything Bitcoin related on your PC. Treat it as an entertainment platform which simply cannot do Bitcoin.
So what can you use?
Smartphones usually have better security model than Windows... But it depends. Say, Android also has this problem where 3rd-party software can do pretty much everything. However, for example, Symbian 9 was a really locked-down platform. (I've touched it a while ago, though.)
Another option is to buy a cheap netbook and install some kind of Linux on it. Netbook costs like $100-200, it takes 15 minutes to install Linux. So this isn't hard.
Make sure that it runs minimal amount of software, definitely no Flash and Java plugin, JS should be disabled for most sites. Use it exclusively for Bitcoin.
If you aren't able to use a secure computer for Bitcoin, it is best to withdraw almost everything to a paper wallets (which need to be generated in a secure fashion, which usually involves booting Linux LiveCD) and leave only the sum you can afford to lose in your online wallet.
I think at some point we'll have usable Bitcoin hardware wallets and exchanges will be able to interact with them to make exchange accounts secure as well.

I'm afraid people just do not get how it works... It's in fact even worse than you think...
Satoshi did not envision mining pools, he assumed that miners will act independently, and so amassing huge hashrate will be hard.
But we got hashrate decoupled from actual mining, as there is a lot of mercenaries ready to sell their hashrate. They call themselves "miners"...
So now to amass a large hashrate one just needs to offer higher payoffs...
People think that as long as nobody has 50% it is all OK. This is WRONG.
All crypto designs have a lot of headroom. For example, it is now unfeasible to go through 2^100 set, but we use 2^256 set. Why?
You should always assume that there are threats worse than you imagined, that attacker will discover flaws you do not see, that he can build hardware faster than you can buy on the market.
But now we don't have any headroom, we are scratching the bottom. Bitcoin has almost failed at this point. If we were talking about hash algorithm, this would be a time to switch to a different one ASAP.
People who claim that we can react in case shit happens are simply delusional. They know nothing about security!
It is possible that attacker will hijack several pools at once and launch a DDoS attack against other pools. In current situation it isn't hard to get 90% of hashing power.
Do you people fucking forgot about stuxnet, virus which destroyed Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges? 
This is the level of attacks governments are capable of. They can hijack secure systems not connected to internet.
Attacking a couple of mining pools hosted on computers connected to internet, hosted by some random dudes on the internet... is just easy.

Let's call this 'casual Finney':
1. Make order **for something you want to buy anyway**, e.g. a cheeseburger.
2. Pay merchant, say, 5 BTC.
3. Merchant accepts zero-conf transaction and gives you a cheeseburger.
4. Double-spend: 4 BTC to yourself, 1 BTC to miner.
5. Now there is a race: you either get nothing, or you get 4 BTC back.
Statistically it is profitable both for you and for miner. It isn't profitable for merchant :-)


Yeah, classic Finney requires a bit more effort because you purchase something _after_ mining a block, but Finney just described the simplest case. You can reverse order and win statistically rather than deterministically.
You can play it against Satoshi Dice losses, by the way, although in that case it is a bit harder to calculate profit.


Well... Perhaps merchant will notice a double spend and run after you with a stick. But that's a bit out of scope of this model.

This isn't true. If you don't pay a fee your transaction can get stuck for some time, possibly forever.

Such use will strongly rely on local Bitcoin&lt;-&gt;fiat exchanges.
 I doubt that paying fees for two such exchanges (in and out) + exchange rate fluctuations will be cheaper than existing options.

Well, it is possible to make instant payments safe, but it requires use of a trusted escrow operator.
Basically, customer needs to put his money into multi-sig escrow of one of instant pay operators. When he pays to merchant transaction needs signature both from him and from instant pay operator. (Transaction might also include a small fee to operator.)
If merchant trusts this operator to not sign these tx outputs ever again he can accept zero-conf transaction.
Yes, it requires some centralization. But instant pay operator cannot steal money.
Worst thing it can do to merchant is to double spend customer's money, but in that case he loses his reputation which would mean loss of revenue from commissions.
Worst thing it can do to customer is freezing his funds indefinitely. But if operator is an asshole he won't have business in future.
Furthermore, we can remove freeze risk for customer via nLockTime transaction which would return funds to customer after some time, but to use it safely we need to review memory pool semantics.
tl;dr: Eventually we'll have a lot of great features.

Miners do not care about inflation, they care about short-term profit, so they only need to consider what it does to exchange rate.

And those users who have significant amounts of Bitcoins want to prevent inflation, so it's not going to happen.

1. You do not need to be tech savvy to use bitcoins.
2. Securing your bitcoins against theft and data loss can be tedious, but you simply need to spend some time on research, it doesn't really require any specific knowledge.
There are many possible ways to secure bitcoins, you need to choose one:
1. use inherently secure computer
2. use centralized service which allows two-factor authentication
3. use offline-generated paper wallets
It's hard to say which is the best, but the simplest is using 3rd party service like coinbase or blockchain.info. That definitely doesn't require any in-depth knowledge.
Then there is "inherently secure computer": a Windows PC isn't inherently secure, but a Mac or a smartphone might be secure enough. But no one really knows for sure.
Finally, offline-generated paper wallets require considerable amount of work, but, if done properly, it is the most secure method. It might take a whole day to set it up.
I would recommend this method:
1. Make a CD with Ubuntu.
2. Boot from it in LiveCD mode.
3. Install Electrum.
4. Write down the seed and some addresses.
It isn't paranoid, but it is the easiest method, I think. If you're lucky, you don't need more than 30 minutes to do this.

It is still possible to see who have signed transaction: scriptSig consists of multiple independent signatures. So it doesn't help, at all.
It is possible to hide identities of parties who signed transaction if Shamir's Secret Sharing will be used instead of Bitcoin CHECKMULTISIG. While it isn't possible to see who have signed it when it is ready, you'll need a very complex protocol to administer it.
Finally, it is possible to provide anonymity via CoinJoin. Protocol is pretty complex, but we're going to need it anyway.
CoinJoin transaction is signed by multiple parties, but each input is signed by one party, so it isn't related to m-of-n multisig.

Entities you're talking about are not really miners, they are just mercenaries which provide hashrate for a fee. True miners are mining pools.
Please read Satoshi's paper. He was talking about giving incentive to nodes which help to secure the network.
But mercenaries are not nodes of the Bitcoin network! They just blindly provide hashing power, they do not even care if it is used to build Bitcoin blocks.
Yes, occasionally they might change pools... But there is an abyss of difference between such mercenaries and full mining Bitcoin nodes.

Yes, it is incomplete... Basically, just a short introduction.
Here are parts about Mastercoin:




parasistically for a secondary consensus system. Recall the two fundemental
proofs that a blockchain provides: consensus ordering/timestamping and and
proof-of-publication. A Satoshi-style blockchain can be used as an ordered
message publication service - it is not possible to completely prevent the
publication of data without whitelisting censorship ...Thus for a given block height `i` we have a set of blocks `B={b_0 ... b_i}` containing messages `M={m_0 ...
m_j}`. By applying a fixed set of rules to that set of messages multiple
parties can independently arrive at the same state of the system.




exists an agreed upon set of rules that, from the contents of the Bitcoin
blockchain, can derive a set of "Mastercoin" transactions and a final ledger
state derived from data encoded in the Bitcoin blockchain.


underlying consensus system. Though the "string bling" system may have only a
handful of users interested in it, an attacker attempting to change the state
of the consensus of what strings have what bling would need to attack the
Bitcoin blockchain directly - a signififantly harder problem. A merge-mined or
independently mined string-bling implementation would probably never be secure
against an attacker with a budget of even just a few thousands dollars, by
parasiticly using the Bitcoin blockchain the attackers required budget swells
to tens of millions.

E.g. suppose creator publishes a script which builds LiveCD from a base distribution (Debian, for example) and open source software. Anybody can run this script to produce identical LiveCD image. Then anybody can study what script does:
1. Can thing taken as a base be trusted?
2. Is there any problem with Bitcoin-related open source software used?
3. Can script be trusted?
It isn't trivial, but it can be done, and many people can work on this together.


Think about it: you can earn millions of dollars by introducing a slight security flaw in your hardware wallet. Perhaps you have integrity not to do it, but can you trust others?
All it takes is to reduce entropy in keypair generation process. Or a buffer overflow in some processing code.
If Bitcoin market cap gets bigger, say $10 billion... And hardware wallets get really popular  , so a large portion of Bitcoin users start using them, believing they are secure... There might be like $1 billion to steal.
It is incredibly lucrative, and so expect incredible sophisticated attacks.


Compared to what? Picking pockets?
Here's a business model: 
1. Suppose I have 1000+ BTC to spare. A lot of Bitcoin users have that much money.
2. I'll hire some black hat hackers to introduce vulnerability. That's, like, a day worth of work for knowledgeable people. The hard part is to make sure that they will share with you :)
3. Produce some of these hardware wallets, sell them. Win over competition through aggressive advertisement and lower prices.
4. Mine wallets, take profit when they accumulate enough money.
It's shockingly simple.


LOLwut, you imply that people who produce wallets are altruists.

I'd rather call it a trade-off. Obviously, it isn't possible to have an ideal system which is good for everything, you have to optimize for something... And Bitcoin is optimized for decentralization, security and anonymity. It isn't optimized for efficiency.


Fee depends on size of transaction, if you spend many "coins" you have have large transaction... (With min fee of 10000 satoshi it is something like 2000 satoshi per UTXO you spend.)
But miners can have any fee policy. It indeed makes sense to stimulate reduction of UTXO set size, so transactions which spend many UTXOs should be cheap. (On the other hand, transactions which make a lot of them should be expensive.)
Fee policy might be changed in future... 


It is only a significant problems for payments less than $0.05 worth of Bitcoins... Yeah right, large transactions... 
Bitcoin works for everything but tiny-tiny stuff which actually constitutes mis-use (small payments should be aggregated).

The difference is that namecoin is **much** less efficient. Effectively each share is a separate coin. While colored coins can represent any amount in one transaction output.
Basically, if you want 1000 shares you can use namecoins. It is kinda expensive in terms of blockchain bloat (and thus fees), but doable.
But you cannot issue 1,000,000,000 shares. You cannot issue 1,000,000 USD which will be divisible down to cents.
Another difference is that thin clients are possible with colored coin, but not with namecoin.

 * shares become untradeable
 * there are no accurate ownership records
 * company can easily fake everything
Moreover, company can do shoddy things without exposing itself.

Bitcoin is not great for small payments... Maximum block size is 1 MB, which means that no more than 1000000/250=4000 transactions can be done in 10 minutes.
Let's do a little calculation... Suppose each user sends 5 payments per day... That means that 115200 will clog the whole network (`115200*5 = 24*6*4000`).
So this doesn't scale to millions of internet users.
As much as I hate centralized solutions, off-chain payment services like inputs.io will definitely help here... Just do not keep more than few bucks worth of Bitcoins on these sites...
The real strength of Bitcoin isn't in an ability to send tiny payments (that will soon go away as Bitcoin adoption increases), the real strength is in freedom: you do not need any paperwork to send and receive Bitcoin transactions.

It's not so simple: If I double-spend casually, I need to make sure that merchant sees the right transaction before I publish send-to-self transaction (otherwise I won't get goods/services).
On the other hand, if I'm attacking an exchange, I can publish two versions simultaneously, as failures to deposit do not bother me.
Also, pay-off is very different: if success rate is 0.1%, it's hardly worth the effort as 0.1% discount isn't interesting. 
But if conditions are right, targeted attack can double my money with high probability.
(However, it's worth noting that majority of exchanges require at least 3 confirmations, while some street vendors accept transactions with 0 confirmations. So we are talking about different probability of success here.)

It isn't linked to your identity in any way. Particularly, it isn't linked to previous Bitcoin transactions you made.
"They" can see only quantity and destination address.


It is already implemented, just somewhat experimental and not very popular. There are three kinds of mixers:
1. Based entirely on trust: You have to believe that person who runs mixer won't leak any information. Such mixers already exist and are used. E.g. [blockchain.info shared send](
2. Based on blind signatures and trusted operator: You only need to trust that operator won't steal your money. But operator himself won't be able to link what you put into mixer with what you spend. This is relatively easy to implement, I believe some implementations already exist.
3. Based on blind signatures, non-trusted operator: operator is needed to prevent abuse, but he is neither able to steal coins, nor link "inputs" and "outputs".
4. Fully peer-to-peer mixing without operator: this is rather problematic. If people just want mixing, they will be able to do that. But if some asshole wants to disrupt the process, he will be able to do that, i.e. prevent others from mixing. This needs more research. One way to do that is to select "operator" among peers randomly, and let him to prevent abuse
One of problems with mixing is quality control, i.e. if you mix with 99 other people it won't be possible to link coins to a particular person (only to the whole group), so it is good. But if 99 other people you mix with are all FBI shills, they will be able to trace your coins by removing knows inputs/outputs. So it is important to be able to assess how many normal people are mixing together with you.


Well, one of ways to think about it is to assume that coins from zerocoin or from mixer go directly to merchant.
So they see can see that, for example, 1.23 BTC payment was sent to address XYZ, but they have no idea who sent this payment. (Well, they can make a guess if you were foolish enough to send this exact amount to mixer.)

It wasn't the first, far from it.
IIRC the first ones were Ixcoin, I0coin and Namecoin. All of them are SHA-256 based, and due to competition with Bitcoin they had to switch to merged-mining.
Litecoin wasn't the first scrypt alt-coin either: Tenebrix was the first, and there was also Fairbrix without controversial pre-mine... 
But Litecoin won in marketing, it had really devoted fan base.
Although Namecoin is mildly successful too, so we cannot even say that Litecoin was the first successful alt-coin... It's more like it's the one with biggest market cap _now_, and that's all.

You quoted highest bids, but those bids might be for small amounts, e.g. 0.1 BTC.
In the screenshot you posted, BitPay claims that it is a rate for 1 BTC. Which means that they go through the bids until they get 1 BTC.
For example, suppose that you want to sell 1 BTC, and bids are 0.1  0.2  0.7 
As a result you'll get 0.1*110+0.2*105+0.7*98 = $100.6. Which is considerably smaller than $110 you could get if you look only at highest bid.
BitPay says that they calculate it for each invoice.

When your idea can be hurt, it is a bullshit idea.
Regardless of what you think about Litecoins, there will be many cryptocurrencies, and you need to take that into account.


They do not need to be entirely new to be useful.
Particularly, if there is an 51% attack on Bitcoin or chain-forking event (which paralyze the trade), it is unlikely that Litecoin can be affected at the same time. So, in theory, you can keep a stash of Litecoins as an emergency liquidity reserve in case there is a problem with Bitcoin.
Note that people usually buy Litecoins with Bitcoins (see btc-e), so it is likely that these people understand how cryptocurrencies work.

It might seem like a sound idea at first, but if you actually inspect source code, it becomes obvious that it was created by one programmer.
1. Reference implementation is a GUI program written for MS Windows
2. Code which does crypto stuff isn't in any way separated from GUI stuff. 
3. Coding standard is rather sloppy... Basically person who wrote this only wanted it to work, but he didn't care much about how nice it looks.
4. Coding standard is inspired by MFC or something similar to MFC, so it's likely that person who have written it learned programming in late 90s or early 2000s.
Let's look at different implementations... Mike Hearn, a security engineer at Google, implemented BitcoinJ as a library for Bitcoin-related stuff. (Same thing bitcoinjs, libbitcoin...)
It just makes sense. If you work in a group, one part of a team works on a library while another part of the team will work on GUI.
If you look at RPOW implemented by Hal Finney, you will notice completely different coding style: it is written in C, specifically serious UNIX-y style.
So what we get from it:
 * Idea of a currency based on proof-of-work was known for quite some time, and there was even an implementation by Hal Finney, but it wasn't terribly successful.
 * Satoshi Nakamoto decided to make a nice, practical implementation, so he decided to code it as a Windows GUI application. So that users can install it on their system and use it. you know. LIke BitTorrent.
 * It is a huge project, and working on it alone he could not afford spending lots of time polishing code. 
As for bulletproof protocol... Bitcoin protocol is essentially based on one, rather simple idea.
it isn't like you _have_ to spend 10000 hours on review before you get an idea how to make it bulletproof. It is either bulletproof or not.
So Bitcoin turned out to be bulletproof.
But it's worth noting that Satoshi Nakamoto is likely a very smart person, and of course he spent some time designing and analyzing protocol, so it is not a happy coincidence.
However, Satoshi isn't god, and from what we see transaction replacement protocol he designed, but did not enable, is an utter crap w.r.t. security. It just cannot work.
Perhaps it could work if whole protocol was modified, but in that case it won't be simple at all, and apparently complexity of such protocol exceeds what one individual can do.
So my opinion is:
 * Satoshi is one person
 * 25-35 y. o.
 * crypto enthusiast or researcher
 * a pragmatic programmer

Well, when people think it will get _at least_ to $1000, going from $50 to $75 is a controlled flow.
Current exchange is basically nothing to people who think strategically.
Let's consider an example: suppose you know what you know now, i.e. that one can sell 1 Bitcoin for $70 in March of 2013. You time travel to 2010 and you want to buy some bitcoins. Would you care about exchange rate going from $0.05 to $0.07? I guess no, these are pennies.
Of course it affects your bottom line, but if amount of bitcoins you can buy is limited, say, to 1 million, it doesn't really matter whether you pay $50000 or $70000 for them when your profit on this is can be $70M.

@_date: 2013-04-20 15:33:01
0. Double-spending is much easier if you do not need 100% success rate. For example, you want to buy a cheeseburger in any case, and it would be cool to get a chance to get money back. Even if it works in 10% of cases, it is still a meaningful attack.
1. It is possible to perform a race attack by sending different versions of your transaction to different miners. Even if you don't know merchant's node, in 25% of cases he will get transaction which pays to him, while miner will mine a transaction which pays back to you.
2. In theory, merchant can protect against that through having connections to many mining nodes, trying to detect whether conflicting version of transaction exists. I'm not aware of any merchant software which does this, by the way.
3. Finney attack is in fact free for miner if it is done properly. (Wiki article is wrong about that, read description by Finney and Gavin on forum.) So it makes sense for a miner to offer this service for a kickback.
4. I've heard an opinion that miners won't want to perform Finney attack because that will undermine value of Bitcoin. Well, that's bullshit. Value of Bitcoin is in proof-of-work based transaction confirmations, and it is not undermined. If anything, it is in miners' interest to perform Finney so that people will pay more in transaction fees. Remember that currently Bitcoin is in experimental phase and transaction fees are insignificant, but they will be significant in 20 years, and we'll see different profit motives.
5. The right way to handle zero-confirmation payments is use of green address or multi-signature transactions and trusted payment processors.
6. Did you read that wiki article you linked to? I'll quote relevant parts:




Where have you got "very low double spend risk after just a few seconds" from? Out of your ass?
People should stop spreading misinformation about safety of accepting payments with zero confirmations. It would be a bad PR for Bitcoin if merchants will get burned by this. Totally undeserved bad PR, as Satoshi have clearly written about necessity of confirmations, it is the essence of Bitcoin, and you're shitting on it.

Well, the hardest part is understanding how Bitcoin works, i.e. anatomy of transaction, script etc. Without understanding that you won't be able to contribute to 'advanced features' directly, only to UI and supplementary parts, which people generally find boring. :)

The problem is that these affiliate programs sent many, many transactions less than $0.05 in value. Yes, sure, all this add to $10. But on Bitcoin level they exist individually, so now fee is large.

It is not.
It is possible that your transaction will be confirmed without a fee, but only under condition that you send a big sum, and do so infrequently.
Otherwise, remember that Bitcoin network is currently unable to confirm more than 7 transactions per second, so it's simply impossible to give everybody an ability to transact for free.

There seems to be some kind of disconnect between Bitcoin users and developers.
Users are happy that they have lots of money in unrealized profits, while developers are underfunded and disorganized.
That said, MtGox offers a shared wallet which is integrated with a payment solution for merchants. So if you have money in your mtgox account and you're paying to a merchant who uses MtGox as a Bitcoin payment processor, payment will be instantaneous and without a blockchain transaction.
But it's not very popular, from what I see...

Let's start over...
Consider an example: I take 1 dollar bill and put some kind of mark on it. Then I declare publicly: "When somebody returns me this marked bill, I will buy him a beer". Now this particular bill is worth not just 1 dollar, but one beer; however, people can still keep using it as 1 dollar.
But is it necessary to put a mark on this bill to do this? No. It already has a serial number, and so it is possible to identify it by serial, so I can make a contract like this: "When somebody give  me a 1 dollar bill with serial XYZ12313DEF, I will buy him a beer".
People often call Bitcoin "digital cash", and actually same kind of trick is possible with Bitcoin. While Bitcoins do not have serial numbers, it is possible to give them unique identifiers in a deterministic way, then you can do the same trick, i.e. you can associate a contract with a certain range of Bitcoin identifiers.
So this is what we do: we do not need to modify Bitcoin protocol, we can use normal Bitcoin transactions and associate additional meaning with them according to certain rules.
So yes, it is "an additional protocol layer that runs on top of it".

Each payment you receive creates a new unique "coin" which has your address written on it. (Technical term for this is "transaction output".)
Coins are not automatically fused together... There are no address balances on protocol level, there are only individual coins.
When you send a payment, you need to use coins which belong to your addresses. Wallet software will automatically select appropriate amount of coins and use them as inputs to a transaction.
Each input is an unique coin with its unique identifier, but since it is of no interest for most people, blockchain.info shows only address which is written on the coin, not its identifier. Hence the confusion.


This is called "coin control": you can pick what coins to use instead of letting wallet software to do it automatically. It might be useful in some cases, e.g. for privacy.

You're essentially asking for a collusion among miners. Do you really want that?
It makes far more sense to fix payment protocols.
Also a special API is not necessary: retailer can spend money it received in a transaction with substantial fee, and miners will include both transactions to collect the fee.
All it takes is to make transaction selection mechanism a bit smarter. That's a couple of hours of work for a good C++ coder. No need to API or anything.

LOL, what? Are you kidding?
You shouldn't compare it to supercomputers. Bitcoin network will be attacked with same ASIC mining devices which were used to protect it.
When mining will no longer be profitable, miners will start mining alt-coins and/or dump equipment on market at dirt cheap prices.
Which means that some company can obtain equipment at price which is a tiny fraction of Bitcoin's market cap, and use it to do 51% attack on Bitcoin.
Why would they do that?
1. Attack Bitcoin.
2. Pump some alt-coin, claiming that it is not vulnerable. E.g. Peercoin, PoS-based.
3. People exchange bitcoins for peercoins.
4. ???
5. Profit!
I'm not sure how it works with merged mining, though, it either fixes the problem or makes it worse... 
If you mine Bitcoin, you can attack a merged-mined currency essentially for free. Same is true the other way around: you can mine alt-coin for profit, and attack Bitcoin for free (electricity costs are already paid off) to increase value of alt-coins you mine.

Intro: Blockchain consists of blocks. Block consists of transactions. Each transaction has multiple outputs. Each output can be 'unlocked' with a certain private key.
Suppose you own 1 Bitcoin. What does it mean?
It means you have a private key which can "unlock"  unspent transaction outputs with total value of 1 Bitcoin. 
When you import a new private key client has to scan whole blockchain looking for transaction outputs it can be used on. Once it finds all such unspent tx outputs it can show you how much money you have.
Technically speaking, client could have kept a database with all unspent transactions outputs indexed by address, then it won't need a rescan. But MultiBit doesn't keep such database.

It isn't orthogonal at all: I believe it is much cheaper to do smaller transaction off-chain (where protocol can be easily changed) than to force everybody to upgrade.
As for "design their applications and interfaces accordingly": you would need arbitrary-precision decimal fractions for that, and very few programming languages and databases support that natively.
So you're asking application developers to an additional level of abstraction... It just won't happen.
People represent Bitcoin values either as double-precision floating point numbers, or as 64-bit integers. This is how it works in practice. Planning for something which is unlikely to happen is ridiculous.

People who use Bitcoin pay for the bloat they make with transaction fees.
Colored coins is effectively a kind of a [smart property]( and as far as I know nobody is against that.
Mike Hearn initially recommended using a separate chain, but I was able to convince him that it is a good thing.


1. You cannot already use it because it is not a standard transaction type, and bitcoin nodes/miners accept only standard transactions.
2. It isn't as secure as atomic coin swapping. With cross-chain trade your funds will be locked forever if other party refuses to cooperate, so cross-chain trade is DoS-attack vulnerable.
3. I'd say it is at least order of magnitude harder to implement. Do you want something now or in next century?
I'll remind you that multi-sig transactions are available for quite a while and is relatively easy to use, but we still don't have anything which end users can use.

You want to demonstrate that it is possible to freeze Bitcoin address just to create a minor annoyance for feds?
Let me tell you something, they do not really care about those Bitcoins. They already have enough money for everything they do.
However, such a demonstration will clearly prove that Bitcoin isn't as free and decentralized as people claim it is, so it will hamper adoption. Actually, if your pool will successfully perform a 51% attack people will likely flee from it. (Which is what feds want, don't they?)
Libertarians support Bitcoin for ideological reasons because they believe Bitcoin is impartial, it is governed by "math", etc. If you demonstrate that a group of people can control Bitcoin, it will undermine the whole idea.
Let me tell you something: you cannot fight violence with violence, censorship with censorship, etc. It just doesn't work.
It's better to embrace the fact that feds can spend those Bitcoins. If anything, feds selling Bitcoins for a substantial amount of money will help to show people that Bitcoins are a real deal and will help adoption.
If you truly are anti-fed, you need to think strategically: wide adoption of Bitcoin might make federal government ineffective and/or starve it. A short-term action like blocking their money doesn't really help with this goal.

Ah, so you really are financially illiterate... Per week per share number is meaningless. What matters is how much TAT earns in a year.
Suppose he owns 550 shares now and they continue paying 0.02 BTC per week for a year. Total amount of dividends is 572 BTC and TAT's cut is 28.6 BTC.
Now suppose he actually manages to acquire 5000 shares. In a year they get 5200 BTC in dividends, and TAT's cut is 260 BTC.
Let's look at it from another perspective: 550 shares are worth approximately 550*2.5 = 1375 BTC, and we expect that TAT will get 28.6 BTC in a year, so he gets 2% of current total worth of shares.
BTW at this rate he will go from 550 shares to 5000 shares in 120 years. That's a bit too incremental, isn't it? So I maintain that this explanation is utter bullshit.


Your naivety and ignorance amuses me.

Yes, but it might save one's ass in case of a temporary problem with Bitcoin.
Suppose there is a network fork or ongoing 51% attack so Bitcoin exchanges are paralyzed: they do not accept deposits, and exchange rate is in a free fall.
It's unlikely that Litecoin will fail at the same time, so if one needs liquidity immediately he might try to buy something for Litecoins or use Litecoin exchange to convert to some different currency.
If government does a 51% attack on Bitcoin using a farm of ASICs, Litecoin won't be affected at the same time. We can of course predict that if government is seriously after Bitcoin, Litecoin and other cryptocurrencies based on a same concept are doomed too. However, there is less certainty, so one might recover at least a part of his investment. (Also, Bitcoin might eventually recover by switching to a different crypto algorithm, but a decision like that takes time...)
Litecoin core devs are seriously considering implementing some sort of PoW+PoS scheme, likely PoA (proof-of-activity). If they will do that, to attack Litecoin one would need to buy stake, so Litecoin users will be able to cash out before cryptocurrency is dead.


Yeah, I was talking about alt-coins in general... It is kinda a long shot: one can buy a bit of each and wait till one of them gets something interesting.
I personally believe it is far more likely that one of alt-chains will get radical/interesting features faster than Bitcoin, as Bitcoin people are like "please don't change anything", they are very afraid of bugs and whatnot... And it is understandable: a bug might cost somebody a million dollars.
It is another question whether such features can prop up price of such alt-coin. Perhaps thing will change when we'll see universal thin and web wallets, where one can just pick a currency from a drop-down list. Network effect will be less pronounced. Some application requires FooCoins? I'll just buy FooCoins on market sending it to my universal client and then to that app. No need to mess with software or anything.
Here are features which are currently implemented in alt-chains or are being discussed:
 * faster confirmations: Litecoin, TerraCoin, Tenebrix etc. (People say it doesn't matter, but it is definitely nice when you get your coins in 15 minutes instead of one hour, I tried it myself. Recently we have seen Meni Rosenfeld's paper which confirms Satoshi's conclusions that security depends on number of confirmations but not time. I did my own analysis and got a formula which estimates attack cost depending both on time and number of blocks. The basic conclusion is that more blocks is better, especially if attacker isn't able to purchase a lot of hashing power.)
 * proof-of-stake to guard against 51% attack: PPCoin, NovaCoin, maybe Litecoin in future. (As I already mentioned, if you have better chances to cash out in case government wants to wipe your currency as government will try to purchase stake.)
 * messaging/temporary space in blocks: Sunny King, the PPCoin core dev, wants it in PPCoin. Also it was discussed for Tenebrix.
 * built-in mixing (aka laundry): supposed to be one of main features of Tenebrix
@_date: 2013-10-25 12:31:56
There is an attack which can work against thin wallet, but not against Bitcoin-Qt:
Attacker needs to create several blocks with fake transactions (i.e. money coming out of thin air) and isolate thin client from the rest of the network. (So it won't be able to see the best chain.)
Bitcoin-Qt will be able to tell that transaction is fake, but thin wallet won't.
But this attack is basically impractical, as one block costs 25 BTC to create. 6 blocks would cost 150 BTC, so it makes no sense to do this unless you get more than  150 BTC worth of goods.
Another reason is that you can do same thing with double-spending, so difference is tiny.

He basically say "Oh, no, don't worry, I won't attack because I am a good guy". Yeah,  let's just trust him.
If two pools cooperate they can easily pull off 51% attack _right now_. So in theory Bitcoin double-spend security have already failed: You need to hijack two servers to perform an arbitrary double-spend. 
It is literally less secure than centralized payment networks because servers which control those networks are heavily guarded and companies will lose a lot in case of attack. On the other hand, Bitcoin mining pools are run by amateurs which do not have resources to have their own secure facilities. Many pools were already hacked. They just need to say "Oh sorry guize, I got cracked". There are no consequences for idiot pool operators.

Except that we know that ECDSA is vulnerable to quantum computing attacks.
And it might vulnerable to other attacks too. There is no mathematical proof that ECDSA is an intractable problem.
All we know is that currently there is no way to figure out ECDSA private key from public key and signature.
I like how people who have no idea how math behind Bitcoin works talk about algebra.
FYI if ECDSA is fully broken, that would mean that as soon as you send a transaction, somebody else can forge signature and redirect funds to his account.
Even if a different signature scheme is available, it won't be possible to simply upgrade, because your funds will be stolen when you're trying to upgrade.

1. Languages with static type checking are usually seen as more reliable. Particularly JS is simply not designed for programming of complex applications.
2. There is nothing wrong with SQL, people use it for online transaction processing all the time, a lot of accounting and banking systems are based on SQL etc. SQL is supposed to guarantee consistency to some extent. Also it is supposed to provide ACID properties. I'd rather be wary of things like MongoDB which are designed for storing crap and guarantee approximately nothing.
3. However, SQL might be too slow for larger exchanges, then one either needs to optimize architecture, or switch to NoSQL. But then choice should be careful. "MongoDB, because it is web-scale!" isn't the right approach here.

I guess it's worth noting that Charlie did not come up with idea to use scrypt.
ArtForz designed it for Tenebrix, Tenebrix was supposed to be an innovative cryptocurrency, with built-in messaging and mixing pool.
However, some things made it non-attractive: premine (which was supposed to be used for mixing pool) and no cap on number of coins (block reward is 50 coins forever).
On the other hand, Litecoin was exact Bitcoin clone, but with scrypt. And without premine.
So Litecoin won at marketing and Tenebrix died.
So, indeed, Charlie's involvement in Litecoin is not impressive at all.

BFL already owes its customers since it repeatedly lied and provided wrong information. I think class action is quite justified.
Full transparency might alleviate the problem: everybody will have same information, so at least it's fair.

People call "the value of the Bitcoin monetary base in USD at current price" a Bitcoin market cap.

Well, the difference is that normally a centralized exchange (such as mtgox) facilitates exchange, works with users (and thus is has to implement AML/KYC policies), etc. If somebody uses mtgox to launder money, then mtgox can be blamed for interacting with that guy.
On the other hand, colored coins issuer only needs to back currency he created. It doesn't need to be involved in each exchange.
For example, a company Foo can issue USDcoins and sell them to companies Bar and Baz. From now on, it only needs to hold USD in its account, it doesn't need to perform exchange or anything like that. (Bar and Baz need an ability to exchange USDcoins back into USD, but it will happen only if USDcoins will be traded significantly lower than USD... So, normally, Foo does noting.)
It will be fairly hard to blame Foo for something if it does nothing.
Companies Bar and Baz can actually facilitate exchange and whatnot. They will be susceptible to takedowns, but takedown will do very little damage as value of USDcoins isn't tied to what Bar and Baz do.
If both Bar and Baz are busted, perhaps there will be another company which will perform exchange.
For end users, it might look like this: just like people buy Bitcoins via LocalBitcoins, they can buy USDcoins from local traders. But in case with USDcoins, there is no price uncertainty: if issuer is trusted, 1 USDcoin should have approximately same value  as 1 USD.
Once you bought USDcoins, you can use them to buy Bitcoins on a global decentralized market.
So, presumably it will help with price discovery: you no longer depend on what your local traders think about Bitcoin price.

"Resolve manually" = "install a version which contains a fix for that bug".


No, that's not how it works. Majority of transactions will be in BOTH chains, so no matter which one will be kept as main, majority of transactions will be fine.
It is really hard to pull of a double-spend even if you have split chain. You really need a buddy miner.
So it's very unlikely that somebody will be able to pull it off if the cause is a bug.
Also, we can plan ahead and add split detector/double spend detector into client. Making double-spend via split chain pretty much absolutely impossible.


I don't think you understand how double spends work.
Once miner have accepted a transaction into a memory pool he won't accept a double-spend. So if transaction is known to majority of miners it is hard to pull of a double spend. Essentially you need a buddy miner to have non-zero chance.
Well, suppose you've just channeled 1000 BTC through some payment processor and somehow last 6 blocks suddently disappeared. You have a chance to win 1000 BTC now. Your actions? How much time you have to prepare a double-spend txn? Whom will you submit it to?

FWIW, I think it would make much more sense to make a Bitcoin wallet out of a "feature phone" than to develop a custom hardware wallet. 
Here's why:
 * Feature phones are cheap (thanks to economies of scale). You can buy a Chinese one for like $30. (although it's probably not what you'd want to use)
 * They can run Java.
 * They have display.
 * They have internet connection.
 * Designed to fit into a pocket.
 * Battery can hold charge for 2+ weeks
 * Can be used as an emergency phone. (This eliminates complaints like "Why the fuck do I need to buy a dedicated devices just for Bitcoin?!")
 * They are secure enough (presumably. This needs further research), especially if you use no third-party apps.
So again, why do people think that dedicated Bitcoin hardware wallets are better?
I see only one reason: potentially, they are more secure... But only potentially, as a company which produces them can leave a backdoor.
What do we need to make this happen?

Bitcoin is flexible. You can use paper wallets/brainwallets for your savings.
But for buying grocery you can use a trusted payment processor...
There are several options: shared wallet, like inputs.io, completely owns money.

Basically both Emperors and Generals optimized for short-term payout, sacrificing long-term outcome in process.
Of course, nobody knows for sure whether it is the case with Bitcoin. However, you cannot say it can succeed simply because there is a lot of resources behind it: it depend on whether people will be willing to cooperate and use their resources efficiently.

It is a well-known e-cash scheme, but it isn't Bitcoin because it relies on central authority.

Schemes similar to Bitcoin started to appear in mid 2000s, but nobody was taking them seriously because they were just worthless tokens and proof-of-work protection wasn't absolute.

Model you're using is totally flawed. Bitcoin is currency, not commodity.
Thus a man with 50 BTC can buy ANYTHING.
He can buy any company, he can buy any government.
Sure, he might play a bit with FX markets too, but that's not the point.
If he has many small unspent transaction outputs he can do it slowly, acting through agents, buying world piece by piece.
If he has one 50 BTC UTXO, that kinds sucks because people will see that it have moved and thus they see this new purchasing power.
But it will totally disrupt normal trade. E.g. suppose you sell one share of a company for 0.00000001 BTC, then you learn that 50 BTC might be unleashed on markets, so it is a good idea to wait until prices adjust.
So people will just stop selling due to uncertainty.

On contrary: this kind of thing Gavin described _prevents_ it.
If you use a web wallet like MyBitcoin.com or inputs.io, you never know whether they have enough Bitcoins because balance only exists in their private, proprietary database.
But if you use off-chain transaction system like Gavin have described, you know which particular coin you own, so there no place for fractional reserve banking.
So we need this because it is better than things which already exist (web wallets).


Good question... I don't think it matters a lot because off-chain transactions are supposed to be used for small purchases, like buying a cup of coffee.
You aren't supposed to keep all your savings in their, keep them in your personal wallet.
What if government seizes pocket money like that? it is bad, but not a catastrophe... It will be more like of a PR disaster for gov't.
Besides that, it is possible to find some fix for that problem: Ultra only needs to transfer its private key to a trusted party to re-enable service, and private key can be transferred through dead man's switch...
So there is basically NO way for gov't to block it reliably, their best bet is to steal private key themselves and create chaos by allowing double-spending in this off-chain system.


"Decentralization" is a cool buzzword, but trade-offs should be made.
Multiple off-chain transaction services can exist at the same time, so some degree of decentralization is possible. It isn't as decentralization as Bitcoin itself, but it won't suffer from Bitcoin's scalability problems.
It's nice to have options.
Don't forget that high transaction rate/blockchain bloat can actually hurt Bitcoin: blockchain will be huge, blocks will be huge, only largish entities will be able to process them, so mining will be restricted to all but these large entities, who can then collude...
So, ironically, offloading tiny and unimportant transactions like buying coffee actually helps Bitcoin decentralization, in a way.

"They are so assured" that economy will suffer without flexibility of money supply. Nothing says that currency itself will suffer.

Argument that deflationary currency is harmful falls apart when we see that multiple currencies can exist at the same time. You know, we now have these alt-coins, and also we have Ripple.
Ripple XRP was created by a for-profit company, but rules were set up in such a way (XRP need to be destroyed when transactions are made) that XRP became valuable. Now I think XRP market cap is in billions USD...
Hypothetically, government can do it in same way: create GovCoins and make it so government-provided services have to be paid for in GovCoins. Also, perhaps, collect taxes in GovCoins. Now these GovCoins have floating exchange rate and government can create more if necessary.

Look, bro, I love namecoin. I'm subscribed to I was mining namecoins. I bought some namecoins on btc-e. I like the concept.
I learned about them way before I learned about colored coins.
But, colored coins
    ARE.
    ABSOLUTELY.
    UNRELATED.
It is a completely different technology, with completely different characteristics and completely different purpose.
Namecoin is for name registration, colored coins is for representing external assets.
It is possible to use colored coins on namecoin blockchain: namecoin will be used to create ticker and contract, colored coin will be used to represent quantity of shares. They can work perfectly in conjunction, as they really complement each other:
 * color definitions need to be installed manually, there is no built-in name resolution which can be confusing
 * namecoin naming protocol cannot work with quantities efficiently
Can you please stop being hostile? I acknowledge all the awesome work behind namecoin, but these things are simply unrelated, orthogonal.
Also it's worth noting that I don't know who invented colored coins, definitely not me, I read about them in article. But I don't know whether that article was original or based on something different.
I only designed protocol and implemented it.

More like $1000+. $100+ gives you a market cap of $1.1 billion, this is nothing in context of savings.
Scary shit...
Form a comment above:


Of course, we cannot expect a significant part of it moving to bitcoin anytime soon... Besides that, there is a lot of friction. Nevertheless, just 0.1% of deposits gives €1.6 Billion bump, and since only a fraction of bitcoin monetary base is available for sale, it will drive market cap much higher....
1/1000 of Spain's deposit... Is it realistic? At first glance maybe not, but then:
1. Pick 1000 of people at random. Maybe 5% of them are kinda tech savvy, 5% have strong distrust in banking system, 5% wants to change something, 5% are relatively wealthy. Quite likely from such pool of people you'll find a wealthy, tech savvy person who wants change, and thus will move significant part of his savings into Bitcoin. (This methodology is somewhat wrong because it needs to be weight by money, not by population, but you got the idea.)
2. Spain is not alone.
3. There are people with lots of $$$ who want to try something new even if it is risky.

It makes more sense to implement proper fork detection than to depend on bug-for-bug matching.
After all, bug can be platform-dependent (particularly, compiler-dependent), then even genuine vanilla bitcoind's will cause forking.
For starters, it is possible to detect 'parallel' chains of orphans... A branch of three orphans would indicate that something is fishy, so it makes sense to notify user of this.
It isn't a rocket science, really. It would just make client software a bit more defensive. Which makes way more sense than making sure that everybody runs the same version.

People use it for payments, so it is.
Volatility is temporary: Bitcoin price needs to adjust, it is simply not adequate now. Once it settles it would be easier to use it as a currency.
I estimate that if a small fraction of population will consider Bitcoin seriously, price needs to grow at least to $1000. From that on, it can grow exponentially until saturation is reached. (Current growth isn't exponential, it is essentially a rapid correction, so it looks completely random.)

Either this was tongue-in-cheek, or this is yet another libertarian nutjob detached from reality.
OK, suppose there is a kidnapping insurance. Company will pay the ransom, but then will try to hunt down the kidnappers so that it won't need to pay them next time.
That's great, right?
Well, no, the optimal strategy for such insurance/private security company is to support kidnappers covertly as it helps to rise insurance premiums.
So I'm fairly sure that kidnapping will get much more frequent (companies need to terrorize the population to stimulate them into buying insurance) while people pay hefty insurance premiums.
It is basically a form of racket.

My point is that if SHA-256 is broken, attacker will use second preimage attack to construct a transaction which has same hash, but sends coins to him.
Do you understand that if hash function is broken, digital signature which uses it can be broken too?


You do not need to find "valid input permutations": you can inject as many extra outputs as you need, and you can stuff arbitrary data in those outputs. So you can manipulate 256 bits of data, or more.
Imagine XOR was used as a hash function. If you can manipulate 256 bits of message, you can change hash however you want, as you know how to manipulate each bit.
If SHA-256 would be completely broken, we'd be able to do same thing. If you can change 256 bits in the input message, you can generate about 2^256 different hashes... One of them might be the hash you're looking for, but currently it isn't possible to find what bits to set to get target hash.
But if SHA-256 would be completely broken, we would know how to do this...


Cool. And I [represented SHA-256 in form of a boolean function]( for shits and giggles.
So I can tell you that if SHA-256 was reduced to 20 rounds it would be pretty much trivial to pull off such an attack. It's probably doable with 30 rounds. 
Best known attack is for 41 rounds, but it's impractical.
Nobody knows how to attack full SHA-256 with 64 rounds, let alone double SHA-256.
But things might change in future. You know, many hash functions already perished...

Well, on the fundamental level money is used to measure useful output of an individual. If you aren't contributing, you don't have a right to use what others have created.
This essentially forces person to be useful in some sense and contribute his labor.
But, of course, the money we have now doesn't always work this way. Say, someone can win a lot in a lottery, and from that point he no longer needs to contribute. It isn't fair.
I'm not sure that world without currency is a good thing... It will be full of people who just entertain themselves, and that doesn't sound like a noble goal.
On the other hand, I've designed a currency which is free of the bug I mentioned above: it isn't possible to accumulate it (at least, not directly). So, basically, you have access to goods and services _while_ you're contributing, or if others support you. But if this currency is the only one, it isn't possible to hoard, to win in a lottery etc.

`git blame` shows you the last commit which changed line in question, so, possibly, it went like this:

3. Did `git blame` to find commit which added that line.
4. Found that it was a patch by Satoshi

I don't think that floor is particularly important (losing 90%, 99% or 100% of your investment are all approximately equally bad), but I can answer that question: Bitcoin-denominated liabilities can provide a floor.
We already have some sort of Bitcoin stock market, and there are companies which are bound to a contract to convert their profits to Bitcoin and to pay them to shareholders this way. So there will always be a non-zero demand for Bitcoin for as long as these companies are afloat and stick to their original contract.
I think bigger stock/bond/derivative markets can help to stabilize Bitcoin price.
E.g. suppose company earned $10M in profits. The more Bitcoin price falls, more of them this company will buy, so it is a feedback aiming to 'correct' Bitcoin price.

First of all, read this: 
It's not PayPal. The Bitcoin protocol is flexible and enables whole spectrum of off-chain services: ranging from ones which have no control over user's funds to ones which have full control.
Even in the worst case (full control, like inputs.io), it still isn't PayPal. Why?
PayPal 1) needs to follow regulations; 2) needs to operate globally, in all countries. So we end up with huge-ass, monolithic, bureaucratic entity.
However, in case with Bitcoin services barrier for entry is pretty much non-existent. We do not need to rely on large services, as smaller ones can simply interoperate because all of them use same Bitcoin protocol, which doesn't have red tape attached to it.
So they won't be like PayPal. A smaller service can create a fidelity bond (which will make stealing hard) and start operating right away. It doesn't need to follow regulations, and it can use various crypto protocols to ensure that users are 100% anonymous.
So all in all, maybe you shouldn't talk about things you do not quite understand, OK?

I don't think you can reduce search tree via constraints on hash: these constraints won't propagate down to variables because a lot of mixing is involved.
Basically, to propagate these constraints you need something like 2^256 cells of memory for temporary results. If you have it, you can drastically reduce search tree.
This happens because whenever you try to expand and simplify the formula, any normal form would be random, huge and incompressible.
You can successfully expand it only if you see an opportunity to compress, and that would mean that SHA-256 design is broken.
Thus constraints can only be used for early rejection, but that might result, in, say, 5% reduction of computation time as you won't need to perform final 5% of computations. Such reduction isn't interesting.

OK, people, who wants to join colored coin dev team?
I think it's quite possible to make a usable client in two weeks(tm) if we get right people working on it.
Sure, there are a lot of competing systems (BitShares, MasterCoins, FreiMarkets and so on), but I don't think any of them had working, usable prototype back in Jan 2013.
I'm referring to ArmoryX. It sucked in many ways, but I'd say it was 90% complete.
The reason why we don't have a colored coin client yet is that I'm working on research and architecture alone. There are people who help with coding, but they can't work on complex parts on their own, so that's the bottleneck.
EDIT: Here's web client demo which runs on the testnet:

I disagree. 
New users will likely prefer one payment network to another. E.g. a user who starts using Ripple first will find out about Bitcoin later, and he'll think:


And he will keep using Ripple... If he ever interacts with BItcoin, it would be through Ripple.
Even more sophisticated users will see pros and cons: Ripple lets them to transfer exact amount of USD, it has all the goodies, is fast and convenient... BItcoin is better only for long-term storage, and maybe for some obscure cases w.r.t. anonymity and such. And then again, XRP is supposed to have some long-term value too.
(And I'll remind that you that Bitcoins will have value only if they are in active use... Otherwise TerraCoin is also good as a long term store of value. :) So people who see Ripple as a superior payment network will see Bitcoin not being a good long-term store of value.)
So this time, when we still have a plenty of people who haven't heard of cryptocurrencies, is in fact crucial: A cryptocurrency which will get more adopters will likely win. **If Ripple gets, say, 90% of new users, Bitcoin will be left a narrow niche: it will only be used by people who highly value its properties, such as cypherpunks and libertarians.** The problem is that normal businesses will see very little value in supporting Bitcoin payments directly when they already support Ripple, so Bitcoin users will _have_ to use Ripple when they need to buy something.
Thus I think Ripple poses very real risks to Bitcoin adoption. OpenCoin has resources to promote Ripple, and also Ripple is in many ways superior now, so it is likely that Ripple will be spreading faster than Bitcoin.


This is actually the worst part: ordinary users think that Bitcoins in Ripple are Bitcoins, while in fact they are BItcoin IOUs... So users think they use Bitcoins, while in fact they don't.
As I mentioned above, it is a problem for real Bitcoin users as they will have to transfer they Bitcoins into Ripple before they can use them in stores which only support Ripple.
And it might be dangerous in the sense that company which issues Bitcoin IOUs can default, so Ripple-Bitcoins will get worthless and unsuspecting users will think it is a problem with Bitcoin itself. So OpenCoin/Ripple can easily undermine credibility of Bitcoin if it gets leading position on market.


Sure, but competition is fierce now as getting adoption among new users is crucial for long-term viability.
Also Bitcoin software is under development, and it is harder to develop it for obvious reasons. So if right now Bitcoin is inferior, it might change if it will get a chance to grow, but if Ripple grabs all new users it won't.
@_date: 2013-02-24 11:47:24
It would make more sense to compare Bitcoin to M2 or M3 money supply than to monetary base: savings is definitely a major use case for a Bitcoin, and savings are accounted for in M3.
At the same time monetary base has much higher velocity than you would anticipate for Bitcoin. Say, in 2007 (before bailout and QE which totally distorted the picture) monetary base was $0.8T, while daily value of transfers via Fedwire was $2.7T.
In comparison, daily value if bitcoin transfers is estimated to be around 400K BTC, while monetary base is ~10M BTC.
Some people here compare Bitcoin market cap to GDP, it makes even less sense.
I believe we can only reasonably compare Bitcoin market cap to total value of various forms of savings and investments, as anything based on turnover or revenue will wildly depend on velocity which we cannot estimate.
Anyway, if Bitcoin grabs a large part of savings cake, we can expect that value of 1 Bitcoin would be on scale of $1M in terms of today USD.

1. Off-chain systems can't be as secure as Bitcoin itself. It is a trade-off between security and convenience. You'll probably want to keep your savings within Bitcoin blockchain itself, but trust your pocket money to off-chain system.

There are different 'coloring schemes', some of them do not consume coins, and most of them consume only tiny amounts.


I don't see how it is troublesome. But if it bothers you, it is possible to provide means of migration.
Coins are not permanently allocated for use as colored coins, you can use them while it is feasible, and later switch to something different which is more efficient, maybe.


We now see colored coins as a concept rather than as a concrete implementation, and this concept, likely, encompasses future 'native' solutions.
Basically, at some point we'll upgrade to a different version.

This is a bad idea as there is no way for user to get sure that you're using enough entropy.
They have to literally trust a black box device.
It's far easier _and_ secure to use Linux LiveCD to generate paper wallets.
E.g. make a Linux distro which boots directly into wallet-generation interface. (Or just shows paper wallet data after you boot.) No networking, no storage...
Users who already have a distrust to their computer can order such CDs from site.
Booting from a LiveCD isn't that hard even from non-techie users.
Now as for security, there are only two attack vectors:
 * deliberate vulnerability injected into LiveCD, like low amounts of entropy, call home, etc.
 * different versions shipped to different users
It is fairly easy to detect attacks:
 * checksum can be used to ensure that everybody gets same version
 * code needs to be verified just once, after that people can trust checksum
E.g. LiveCD can be derived from Debian or other reputable Linux distro, and patches can be examined by knowledgeable people.

@_date: 2013-01-06 01:43:02


How do you "produce transactions in both sides of the fork"?


To make your transaction not spendable in one of chains you need to get coins from a transaction which isn't spendable in one of chains.
This is possible only if you're the attacker, i.e. you've constructed such transaction intentionally.
Thus to avoid such problem we should pick the chain which is more strict. Then a chain which has attacker's double-spends will simply be dismissed. Additionally we can punish the attacker by banning his coins, but it is an extra.


Well, to enable split network detection they should forward bad blocks which are sufficiently recent and meet difficulty criteria. Say, since last checkpoint. I'm fairly sure those wouldn't be trivial to produce.


I don't see anything particular complex about it. Devs simply need to stop thinking that PoW is a solution to each problem and make a bit more robust system which would proactively detect double-spends and network splits.
The purpose of bitcoin client is not to show number of confirmations, it is to make sure that there is no foul play or problem of some sort.

On the other hand, I got earned 0.6 BTC in one no-risk trade.
There is [MININGCO.ETF]( fund on btct.co, basically it just owns shares of other mining companies, and periodically updates NAV/U. One day there were almost no asks, so I put one at 1.8, when NAV/U was 1.2.
Somebody comes and buys from asks... Actually it went up to 2+, that's just insane.
Then I put bid at 1.2, and few hours later it is filled. Thanks for 0.6 BTC, guys.
Sure, it is not exactly no-risk, since I have exposure to MININGCO.ETF (it's unlikely that NAV will change significantly, but its account might get hacked or something), but the point is that it's pretty easy to get money from these exchanges, no advanced strategies are required.
There is a guy who runs a trading fund, he gets something like 5% return from trading _each week_, for months now.

One important use case is currency exchange. Companies like MtGox might issue USD vouchers, which can be atomically traded for Bitcoins. It is an unique trait of this technology that Bitcoins are represented as Bitcoins, so there are no counterparty risks.

Well, two things get conflated...
First, Bitcoin as a payment system/"wallet" software. I'd say it compares fairly well to PayPal and its sketchier analogs.
Second, Bitcoin as a currency... You can learn how it works, but you cannot predict exchange rate, it's pretty much arbitrary.
So I'd say it's actually OK that it is hard for ordinary people to start using it... Risk and uncertainty is too high. 
People who cry about easy of use do not quite get it, I think.
That said, it would be cool if everybody (who can afford) it would buy like $100 worth of Bitcoins... And forget about them for some time. Just so money supply is more evenly distributed.
Centralization of Bitcoin wealth is already kinda a problem: 
But it's only a beginning... Once wealthy people will figure it out, they will try to buy as many Bitcoins as they can... And so it is possible that only few percent of Bitcoins will be in circulation.
By the way, if people buy Bitcoin as a long-term investment, they don't care about how soon they will get them... This could allow people to buy them with credit cards. Perhaps in physical form...

I don't think there is a safe way to accept an "instant" (zero confirmation) transactions. Without using a trusted party, that is.
@_date: 2013-10-10 08:22:34
Bitcoin is relevant because often setting up a payment system account is too cumbersome for potential workers:
1. there is a plenty of incompatible payment systems
2. most of them have registration process which is kinda annoying (fill these 10 fields, then send us scan of documents)
3. some payment systems are not available in some countries (e.g. I can't receive PayPal payments here in Ukraine)
4. they are not friendly to microtransactions, overhead might be large
5. people might be worried about the need to report income to tax authority
On the other hand, setting up a Bitcoin wallet takes like 15 seconds, and its fully anonymous, so one doesn't need to worry at least until he needs to cash out.
So somebody looking for work can simply set it up in matter of minutes and actually try completing these tasks/getting paid.

Colored coins enable functionality similar to Ripple on top of Bitcoin platform.
Let's have both of these technologies available and let them compete with each other. Market will decide which is the best tool for the job.
Bitcoin has certain advantages: it allows one to store or more large amounts of value with no counterparty risk. Also it is likely [more resilient to attacks from government]( what happens if OpenCoin gets cease &amp; desist?

It isn't really necessary to wait 10 minutes. Once you see that transaction was accepted by the network, double-spend is highly unlikely.
In general, decentralized exchanges do not provide same kind of guarantees and same kind of speed as centralized exchanges.
But colored coins do not rules out centralized exchanges. There is a whole spectrum of options, ranging from fully decentralized and trustless solution to a fully centralized one which is similar to existing exchanges like BTCT.co.
For example, centralized exchange might act like a eWallet (such as inputs.io): colored coins can be moved to a centralized exchange, traded there, then withdrawn to a standalone wallet, or to a different exchange.
But that's, probably, the worst case. Some options in between are more interesting: e.g. multi-sig transactions can be used to make sure that traders play by rules, but exchange won't ever hold one's coins, it will act as an arbitrator of sorts.

Well, do they really send pieces of JavaScript? Or is it just a theory?
**EDIT**: I've just checked this. They (bitZino) inject pieces of HTML into a page, and HTML can include scripts, so yes, they _can_ do this. This is _not_ how security-sensitive sites should be implemented. It is definitely possible to render all HTML on client side, so this is lame.
It is NOT a normal practice to send pieces of JavaScript.
For example, consider web wallets such as blockchain.info wallet: all JavaScript is loaded at start, and you can verify it. After that ONLY data is sent, not code.
Server can send code ONLY if client requests it, server cannot push code onto client.
So it is definitely possible to implement provably fair game in a browser. For example, all code can be wrapped into a browser extension, no code will be downloaded during the game.

I've been waiting for this features for two years, and as a developer I have been looking how to implement them too. Here are problems I've identified:
1. Developers who work on mainstream wallets (Bitcoin-Qt, Electrum, MultiBit) want to implement features which would make Bitcoin more usable first. That is, things like HD wallets, payment protocol (invoicing), and so on. Experimental features have lower priority.
2. Bitcoin protocol isn't enough to implement these advanced features: you need to design a new protocol, some means for communications and so on. It is fairly easy to implement them if you use some kind of a centralized service, but developers of mainstream wallets want to avoid this, they want some kind of decentralized solution. And it would be very hard to standardize it.
3. It is hard to find funding for these features. I've created a subreddit for this: Several developers have shown interest, but nobody wanted to sponsor them. Bitcoin Foundation funds some projects, but their grant proposal process is slow and lacks transparency.
However, this doesn't mean we'll never get these features. Quite likely they will be implemented in Armory (they already have funding and capable developer(s)), maybe in Electrum (it already relies on servers).
Also, many of these advanced features are already implemented, but implementation isn't usable: it is based on command line tools, some obscure wallets and so on.
As for me personally, I was going to try to implement escrow and contracts myself, but I've been busy with colored coins, so simply had no time.
If you're a developer and want to implement some of these advanced features and do not need a lot of money for that
1. I will provide up 10 BTC bounty (out of my own pocket) for a working demo (i.e. implementation doesn't need to be perfect, but it should be usable at least under certain conditions)
2. I can also provide an advice on how to implement them.
3. I think after demo is working, perhaps it would be possible to get funding from Bitcoin Foundation
It is possible that somebody is already in process of implementing something, so to avoided duplicated work it makes sense to look here:  and here:  first.

The thing is, you don't need to make Armory and TrueCrypt preinstalled. Here are simple instructions:
1. Create Live USB using unetbootin or something similar. There is an option to allocate space "to preserve files across reboots", use it. It will create a file with Linux partition in it.
2. Boot from that Live USB, install software you want.
3. Backup whole USB disk.
Easy, eh? It works because Live CD/USB uses union fs (IIRC aufs) to have read-write fs layer on top of read-only fs layer.
As for preinstalling, you know, I run Linux on my laptop and I do programming for living for 10+ years, but I have no idea how to do that. You just don't need that unless you want to make your own distro.
Also it is a very good idea to ask on forum before doing something. It takes 5 minutes and can save hours.
Say, I have no idea how to make that RW partition encrypted, but I'm sure there are people who understand how Live USB is initialized and they are willing to help.

Bitcoin blockchain will be like a backbone, but that doesn't mean that all payments must go through it.

Liberty Reserve wasn't closed because of Bitcoin, it was closed because it is a shoddy digital currency.
It is possible to buy and sell Bitcoins without using shoddy digital currencies:  If you're serious, you can do a wire transfer to/from mtgox. If you want a small amount, you can buy for cash locally, or use a retail outlet like BitInstant.
So no, it won't render BTC worthless.
FFS, illegal drugs are outright illegal, but people find a way to buy and sell them.
Also it's worth noting that while there is a chance that 'conduit' will be cut exactly when you use it, it is fairly small... Once you moved money to exchange you do not care about conduit anymore.
So I think the effect will be that people won't keep money in centralized digital currencies, but will transfer to Bitcoin for long term storage.

I don't think you understand how it works.
 "Collapse of financial system" means that some assets will become worthless, banks will get bankrupt etc.
However, ETF is a legally separate entity, and you own shares in it. No matter how many banks will collapse, you have shares, and after liquidation you'll have Bitcoins or their equivalent. You only need for a database which record ownership to state intact.
If you believe we'll have full scale society collapse so that we won't have internets and electricity, then I'm afraid you shouldn't invest into Bitcoins, but instead buy physical gold (for example).
You're also very wrong assuming that Bitcoin is worthless until we have "financial system collapse". People might invest into Bitcoin simply because they think it will appreciate in future. (Or, say, daytraders make money on daily fluctuations of price.)
It is possible that Bitcoin appreciate even if "financial system collapse" won't happen: it is useful on its own.

No. Finney attacks cost you nothing: you can pull them off while mining normally.
(Person who wrote about it on wiki got it totally wrong, he assumed that somehow one needs to mine specifically for double-spend. It is NOT what Finney described.)
It can be much worse then what Gavin describes: users can try to double-spend all the time by sending send-to-self transaction to a nefarious miner. It is strictly profitable both for miner and for users, and it is effortless.


Yes, but it applies only to bruteforce attacks, not to Finney.

Well, challenge-based protocol will protect against attackers who can only listen but cannot modify data.
For example, if decryption of SSL is possible, but takes time, attackers won't be able to do a real-time MitM, but they can recover password from it and use it later.
Hashing without challenge is just pretty much useless... Basically if attacker gets password hash this web site is pwned, but attacker won't be able to use password on other web sites. (Assuming that password is strong and salt is used.)

Actually the older version of Mastercoin had more interesting approach involving derivatives.
Current approach is deliberately naive... Currently (after some iterations) the idea is that there will be an issuer which loves the concept so much that he will put some of his own money into escrow.
If the value of escrow is 150% of value of issued currency, it is kinda stable.
Furthermore, there is an idea to strengthen the escrow by taking 0.1% out of each transaction and adding it to escrow. So escrow becomes more valuable.
And, finally, it might work as long as value of Mastercoin goes up.
E.g. suppose current value of 1 mastercoin is $1. People buy $1000 worth of new USD currency, and 1000 MSC go into escrow.
Next day value of mastercoin is $2, and now new currency is 200% backed by mastercoin.
The problem with all this is that absolutely nobody did any simulations, and scheme wasn't reviewed by serious economist.
As a mathematician, I believe that n certain circumstances it will fail.
E.g. suppose that initially escrow is 300% healthy and mastercoin price grows too, and people buy more and more of this mastercoin-backed USD.
But the problem is, each new dollar created dilutes escrow extra backing.
Suppose at some point it becomes super-popular and people bought $10M worth of USD coins, but now escrow value is only 125% of the value issued USDs... Which is nice, but at some point mastercoin price might drop (as it is fueled by speculation), and escrow value will drop to 99%... Now as USD coins are no longer backed, people will try to sell them, sell mastercoin and get real USD.
This creates positive feedback and eventually the whole thing collapses.
Good luck.

I'm sure some people in these companies already know about Bitcoin, but there are no reasons for them to accept it.
Basically, retailers have lowest incentive to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is simply not designed to be used by retailers. You know, payment confirmations are not instantaneous, it cannot handle large number of transactions etc.
Bitcoin is designed for payments over internet. 
It makes sense for a company like Namecheap to accept Bitcoin because they need to accept payments from people from all countries. While VISA and PayPal can do that, in some countries these payment systems are pain in the ass, so Bitcoin makes sense. Also I'm sure that Namecheap has to pay significant fees to these payment systems, and also their international customers are paying conversion fees... So Bitcoin might actually save them money.
Retailers are in a different situation because they need to service clients within a single country, so they have payment system optimized for that case.
Also it's worth noting that when small and medium companies started accepting Bitcoin, it didn't make a lot of difference. Unless they specifically cater to Bitcoin users, Bitcoin sales will be a tiny fraction of their revenue,(`*`) definitely not worth it. It is a matter of principle.
But big companies do not care about principles. If they are publicly owned, it is a _duty_ of their executives to do increase shareholder value.
I understand that you think it would be cool if Bitcoins were accepted by Walmart, but it is a bad idea, really. It's better to think what Bitcoin is good for than to think what will be good for Bitcoin. 
`*`: I don't remember exact number, but Reddit's CEO mentioned that Bitcoin constitutes only 1-2% of Reddit Gold sales, even though people campaigned for that. It's not worth extra complexities in accounting it brings.
On the other hand, 95% of revenue of [BitVPS]( comes in form of Bitcoin payments. But there is a reason for that: there are thousands hosting companies which accept VISA or PayPal, while few hosting companies accept Bitcoin, so Bitcoin users flock to it...

I have an interesting data point. Compare Litecoin stock exchange:  and Bitcoin  stock exchanges:  
LTC-GLOBAL has several 'real sector of economy' companies listed on it:
 * OPCU is a hosting and IT provider in Mexico
 * S.WIHEE is an "independent contracting and service company" in USA, particularly they do servicing of cellphone towers, among other things
 * TABITA is a tiny bakery in Mexico
 * ART is a ceramics studio in Russia
 * ESECURITY-SA (bonds) is DDoS-protected hosting provider
Now, on btct.co you see only mining, funds and Bitcoin-focused companies, with the exception of BitVPS.
On BitFunder, the only company which isn't mining/fund/financial is BitPride, a store which sells bitcoin-themed.
So, basically, only LTC-GLOBAL was able to attract companies which aren't cryptocurrency-related.
I don't know why is that, maybe just lower fees, but it's an interesting trend.

I don't think Bitcoin should be really adopted by masses as a payment system and currency, this is just unreasonable.
I think it needs is a killer app: i.e. something which isn't possible with traditional payment system/currencies.
Say, Satoshi Dice gambling is like that, but it looks like gambling alone is not enough, we need more.
Another example I can think of is financial markets. We already have some, but they are very niche. Actually I'm working in that direction, i.e. software for decentralized financial markets, perhaps that would help.
One more example: pay a tiny amount of Bitcoins to download something from torrent in a secure fashion (without a possibility you'll get caught).
But, of course, killer app is not alone, people need to be able to exchange bitcoins, keep them safely etc. So, things like vending machines, hardware wallets etc.
Personally, I don't think we should wait for use of Bitcoin in brick &amp; mortar stores: Bitcoin isn't optimized for that, and it isn't necessary.

No, they don't. Issuer can simply clone state of trading server and sell same bond twice.


Do you understand that it is possible to give different view to different people? E.g. most people will trade on your normal, but you will route some to a cloned fake server.
Yes, it is theoretically possible for people to rely on verification by third parties, but then we basically have a distributed consensus problem... It can be solved, it is in fact how Ripple works.


The idea is that some bondholders are malicious. Attacker will buy bonds once, then hijack the server and sell same bonds many times...
@_date: 2013-10-10 16:26:51
No. Consider this situation:
1. Seller doesn't even has goods, he is doing this to troll buyer.
2. Seller and buyers put 1 BTC each into a 2-of-2 multisig address.
3. Seller informs buyer that he is a troll, but buyer can get 90% of his money back if he will sign a transaction which pays 1.1 to buyer
4. Buyer thinks that 0.9 BTC is better than 0 BTC, thus he agrees to sign a transaction which pays 1.1 to seller and 0.9 BTC to buyer.
5. Both parties sign transaction, now seller gained 0.1 BTC and buyer lost 0.1 BTC.
@_date: 2013-01-14 09:04:46
Good idea with offline box (if it is connected to server perhaps it is not completely offline, just not accessible, right?), but it doesn't protect against malicious owner.


For each event we create two kinds of bonds: P-bond pays 1 BTC if event outcome is positive, N-bond pays 1 BTC if event outcome is negative. If event is negative P-bond pays 0 BTC.
Prediction market operator does not interact directly with end users, instead it allows "primary dealers" to create P-bond/N-bond pairs by depositing Bitcoins into 2-signature escrow. 1 BTC creates 1 pair. (Obviously, P-bond value + N-bond value = 1 BTC since one and only one of them will pay.)
Primary dealers sell P-bonds and N-bonds on p2p market. To avoid exposing themselves they should sell them in pairs. To profit from it they might sell pair for more than 1 BTC total.
Users then trade bonds among themselves on p2p market. Value of P-bond + value of N-bond should stay close to 1 BTC on market due to arbitrage. Selling P-bond is more-or-less equivalent to buying N-bond.
If event outcome is positive, primary dealers need P-bonds to unlock their deposit. So they will buy P-bonds at price up to 1 BTC to unlock deposit.
Likewise, if outcome is negative, primary dealers buy back N-bonds.
Probably deposit amount should me somewhat higher than amount of bonds issued to incentivize primary dealers to buy back bonds. (If you need to pay 1 BTC to pay 1 BTC it simply makes no sense.)
There are three kinds of problems possible:
1. Collusion between prediction market operator and some of primary dealers which will let them to unlock escrow without buying back bonds. It is unlikely to happen if operator and primary dealers are incentivized with fees they collect.
2. Required bonds are lost or are withheld by members of public; thus some of escrowed funds are blocked. In that case market operator can simply unlock deposit after some time on his own terms.
3. Primary dealer dies or loses his private key. It kinda sucks, I guess market operator will have to buy back bonds with his own money. This can be alleviated with more complex escrow.

I think derivative market can fix that, sort of. If you're paying supplier in USD, you can buy USD futures to compensate for possible price fluctuation.
If we'll have a decentralized derivative market, same software which is used for bitcoin transactions can be used to purchase and sell futures as needed. So it can become an integral part of merchant operations: he will just describe what behavior is desired and software will make sure it works correctly.
It will probably help to stabilize exchange rate too

Why would somebody having a lot of Bitcoins buy Litecoins?
@_date: 2013-07-31 06:49:09


Clearly you have no idea what you're talking about.
If there is a pre-image attack on SHA-256, ALL alt-coins are fucked, because they all use SHA-256 for transactions hashes.
The threat isn't vulnerability in SHA-256, the threat is centralization of mining power and attacks on network.
Bitcoin and Litecoin nodes are separate, so it's very likely they won't have a problem at the same time.
@_date: 2013-06-06 11:02:44


It doesn't work that way. Actually you take some coins (transaction outputs you have private key for) as inputs and send some of value to address Z and the rest to your address, maybe back to address Y.




Fee is value of inputs minus value of inputs.


No, difficulty makes finding next block more difficult. It is adjusted according to time which was used to generate last 2016 blocks. If it takes less than 2 weeks to create 2016 blocks difficulty goes up. If it takes more than 2 weeks it goes down.


A collection of blocks which are linked with each other via hashes.
Each block can include transactions. Miners make sure that transactions which are included into blocks are correct:
 * they include proper signatures
 * they do not 'create' money
 * they can only spend coins which existed in block chain before


Well, you need to understand what normal transactions look like. Then you'll understand that coinbase transactions are special, unlike normal transactions they create coins which did not exist before.
Normal transaction is like "take 5 coins from X and send 5 coins to Y", coinbase transaction is like "send 5 coins to Y" without previous inputs.
Anybody can create a coinbase transaction, but only one coinbase is allowed per block, and of course miner who creates that block will create coinbase which will pay to him.
Miner first creates a block body with all transaction, and then tries to find a header which would have hash in target range.


Well, why are you trying to learn it? It is complex stuff, requires some time to get used to it
@_date: 2013-06-07 10:52:09
@_date: 2013-06-01 17:55:55
I think the consensus is that majority of users can rely on simplified payment verification (SPV).
Even if you do not want to rely on confirmation from a particular server or servers, you can wait until your transaction is included into blockchain... It costs a lot of money (in opportunity costs) to insert wrong transaction into a block (as that block will be considered invalid), so after you get some confirmations you can be sure that transaction was right.
People who actually need to download blockchain are miners... But they can discard most of it right as they download it, keeping only list of unspent transaction outputs, which is much smaller than blockchain. (And it doesn't grow so fast.)
So only few nodes need to keep full blockchain, and it is in fact possible to cut it into pieces so no one needs to store the whole thing.
In theory it is possible for miners to switch to SPV too, although that would be a security compromise, but a reasonable one.

Governments cannot peg prices because they want to fund deficits with currency created by national central banks. Basically, they want free money, and it just doesn't work.
It is possible to implement peg perfectly, you just need to limit the amount of currency you have issued to how much you hold in reserve.
But that means that if your currency is backed by USD, you need to hold USD in reserve.
If you do it in any other way, it can fail.

I guess I should provide some context:
I've created a first basic prototype in September of 2012 and then proceeded to design of a more sophisticate version,  one which will be suitable for decentralized exchange.
After several months of discussion, we have settled on _order-based coloring_ and implemented ArmoryX, and, later, WebcoinX. 
However, in Spring we've found that _order-based coloring_ is less than perfect (or even outright unusable, depending on how you look at it), and many alternatives were proposed, but there was no clear winner among them.
At that point I decided that it's better to embrace the fact that multiple coloring schemes can exist, and the design of the _next generation of colored coin clients_ should take that into account. We needed some general model of what coloring scheme might be, so I've described so-called [theory of colored coins]( NGCCC was announced in June.
There are several candidates for a new and improved coloring scheme, like POBC and bitfield-based, they are already implemented in NGCCC (ChromaWallet). But we still come up with improvements, so we haven't settled on something specific.
As far as I know, there is only one other group of people also working on colored coins now, it is led by Vitalik Buterin. Actually I thought Vitalik will work together with me and we'll collaborate both on the whitepaper and on  the reference implementation, but Vitalik decided to work on the whitepaper alone. But he is aware of NGCCC's architecture and previous work (in fact we worked together on ArmoryX, the old client), so it is understood that the whitepaper he is writing will be generally compatible with NGCCC so we'll add support for it.


Almost everything can be developed in parallel.


Currently order-based coloring is used, but we do not recommend issuing mainnet colored coins right now as it is understood that OBC sucks.

Payment processor will get a fee from each transaction, and people will use it only as long as merchants trust it. So if he ever double-spends he will lose this revenue stream.

Colored coins are interesting largely because assets represented by them can be traded for Bitcoins without any need for trust whatsoever: via so-called atomic coin swap transactions.
This is what enables p2p exchange. Not just for stocks and whatnot, but currency exchange too... Don't you want to reduce dependence on centralized exchanges?
Secure cross-chain trade isn't completely impossible, but much more complex and troublesome.
If you do not care about trade for Bitcoins then you can as well use Ripple or Open Transactions.

What prevents me from sending send message even if I do not have those coins on balance?
Do florin miners check contents of messages?
With colored coins (I mean, the real ones), you only need to check transaction subgraph which goes from genesis transaction to output in question. One doesn't need to scan the whole blockchain.


I know. I receive a lot of messages, and if I would answer to each of them I  would have no time to work on colored coins.

"Coin" is just a transaction output which says who can spend it, like "to spend this coin, one needs to sign spending transaction with public key XYZ".
Normally sum of values of outputs of a transaction is less or equal to sum of values of inputs. So money is not created through regular transaction. Or rather, same value is created and destroyed at the same time.
However, if you mine a block you can include a special "coinbase" transaction which has no inputs, but has outputs, so it creates money.
So Bitcoins which are mined exist as coinbase transaction outputs which pay to miner's address.

It is a little known fact, but _colored coins_ is in fact a concept rather than a specific protocol, and colored coin protocols might differ substantially.
Bitcoin protocol allows transaction outputs with zero satoshis in them (no shit), if we're going to use that feature, zero Bitcoins will be used as colored coins.
But that won't work smoothly now because this feature is considered non-standard now (i.e. discouraged, your transactions won't get into blocks), so we use simpler approach like _order-based coloring_, which is also less controversial, I think.

No, that's not how it works... The problem is, there is always a counter-party in a trade. If you're buying something, counter-party either needs your address, or you need to meet you in person. Also, you need to buy coins somewhere.
So in the end, it depends on how good you are at cloaking you identity when you trade.
OR you can use a mixing service. Bad thing, currently you need to trust mixing service. However, you can let coins go through many mixers, and gov't needs to invade each of them to trace your coins. (Note, however, that mixers can steal your coins.)
However, people are working on p2p secure mixer. When it will be available, you can say that Bitcoins can be almost untraceable. But we aren't there yet.

He wanted Tenebrix mining to have as little overhead as possible (so that it is possible to use box for other uses alongside Tenebrix mining), so he made it so scrypt uses only 128 (or 64?) KiB, and thus fits in CPU's cache.
ArtForz is also a person who created the first GPU Bitcoin miner. So, being a competent GPU programmer, he thought it is impossible to make fast GPU miner.
He was wrong. People found a trick to do it.
So, Litecoin just copied this scrypt parameters... Pretty much everybody understood that it is risky (too low!) from the start, and we knew that it doesn't severs its original purpose since GPU miners appeared (years ago).
It isn't news at all...

For people who understand the technology, it was entirely obvious that ASIC mining is the end game for Bitcoin. CPU, GPU and FPGA mining existed only because there wasn't enough capital to develop ASICs. But it's a nature of SHA-256 function that it requires relatively few logic gates to compute.
Now for scrypt, it is less obvious... It is memory-hard, so you can't do it without using many logic gates to represent memory. So it looks like that gap between GPU and ASIC implementations won't be so large.
And Litecoin uses only 128 KiB of RAM... IF you use scrypt with different parameters, it is very well possible that ASIC won't be feasible at all

Under the hood, Bitcoin protocol doesn't have a notion of 'balance', it works on transaction output level, which work like coins of sorts.
So this isn't a problem. But you absolutely need to use colored coin client to work with colored coins. If you don't, you colored coins will likely be destroyed.
However, safeguards will be in place: colored coin clients will work only with special colored addresses, so that you won't be able to destroy your coins via negligence.

Lead developer here.
As altoz have mentioned, it is just a preview version for enthusiasts, I didn't want to get it on front page...
Anyway, while we are here, one thing which will likely be overlooked is that features other than colored coins are also planned. (Sadly, not implemented yet, it is vaporware...)
I started following Bitcoin development in 2011, and I've got really interested by non-standard and multisig transactions, but that basically requires a custom wallet, and it is not a small undertaking. (Well, now it's possible to do them via raw transaction API, but it wasn't available back then, I think.)
I tried to get back to this idea [this Spring]( but I was distracted by colored coins development...
Anyway, now I have a custom wallet which works the way I want, so now nothing stops me from adding support for these features like dispute mediation, instant payment service, escrow, mixing, etc. right into the wallet.
I see some wallets are aiming to provide these features too (e.g. DarkWallet will have built-in mixing), but I think competition is good, and my ultimate goal is to include everything which makes sense.

Mining is like a lottery: each time you produce a new hash (usually, by changing nonce field), you have a small chance to win.
Consider this example: you generate a number between 1 and 1000, and you win when your number is  less than 100. Then probability of winning in one round is 10%.
If target range is 1..50, then probability of winning is lower is only 5%.
Bitcoin mining is exactly like that, but with huge numbers, and you cannot cheat because of the way hashing is done.
So, computer generates a number between 0 and 2^256, and it wins when this number is less than 2^220. Then probability of winning in one round is 1/2^36, that's something like 0.000000001%.
So what happens when computer wins? It creates a valid block, and can publish it. Coinbase transaction creates new money and sends them to owner's wallet.
Protocol changes the target range to adjust difficulty.

Well, it's already a serious inconvenience.
For example, I want to run bitcoinjs-server on a VPS, I had to leave it over night, and it still haven't downloaded all blocks yet. (It uses leveldb, so shouldn't be very different from bitcoind 0.8, I think.) I imagine VPS provider isn't happy over high CPU and I/O utilization either, TOS usually says that you shouldn't max out resource utilization.
What I don't like is that developers do not even want to discuss how to make it more scalable, the maintain that as long as it's possible to buy hardware which can handle a full node it's OK.
I believe it's possible to reduce storage costs, or even make transaction processing distributed, but we won't get there if nobody cares.

Bitcoin is already high-risk high-reward kind of an investment, so there are NO practical reasons to play on stock market.
For an ordinary investor, it is just a gamble.
If you're a trading genius and are prepared to spend lots of time on reading all available information, then your chances are better. But still, there are no guarantees: nobody could predict what happened with BTCT.co, and it's hard to recover from that.
Otherwise, money invested in these "capital markets" is money spent on learning/entertainment, do not expect returns.
(And, currently, climate is very bad as two exchanges have just closed. On the other hand, if you can tolerate the uncertainty you can buy assets at deeply discounted prices.)

No, this is just wrong. 
Miners get Bitcoins which aren't mined yet.
They'll incur these costs even if there are no transactions. Actually this was the case in early days of Bitcoin, and it is still the case with some alt-chains.
Does that mean that cost per transaction is infinite? Fucking no. Energy is spent to obtain coins, it is 100% unrelated to number of transactions.


But we know total number of Bitcoins to be mined, so inflation is always priced in and does not affect market value of Bitcoin.


Definitely not. Do you think that transactions will be more expensive if there will be less of them?
This makes no sense. Get a clue.

Do you even understand what is this about?
Assets are still owned by people. What have changed is who manages these assets: government or private corporations.
You need to understand that the way pensions are managed is a very important matter, important to state and to politics within that state.
Suppose that you allow a private company to manage pensions. And that company manages to lose pretty much all funds, either due to mismanagement, or due to taking too much risk.
Now what? Millions of people depend on pensions, will the state simply allow elderly to suffer without money?
Do not forget that elderly can vote too, so in the end government will have to compensate for such loss.
Thus how pension money management MUST be regulated: government needs to make sure that they are managed in a safe way, because government will be ultimately liable for it.

I don't know what kind of reasoning bitcoinwatch uses, but I can try to "reverse engineer" it...
It looks like bitcoinwatch assumes that 1 bitcoin hash = 12700 floating point operations.
On the other hand, we know that one bitcoin hash = 2 SHA-256 calculations = 6500 operations (mostly integer operations) on NVIDIA GPU.
So apparently they assume that 2 floating point operations are equivalent to 1 integer operation. I don't know why. It might be an error. Or, maybe, they assume that there is hardware which has twice as many floating point execution units.as it has integer units.
As I mentioned, this equivalence only makes sense when you consider CPU or GPU mining.

Existence of such insurance does not make it safe.
Example: In Cyprus, business lost ~80% of money on its transactional account and cannot continue operating:  
Also, I live in Ukraine... Which recently had several bank failures. Gov't insurance was extensively discussed on local forums, and the conclusions is that it means approximately nothing: gov't can change terms if shit goes bad, or it can simply delay payments indefinitely. (Which already happened: some people spent years trying to get their money out of undead bank even though it was insured and everything. Gov't simply said that as bank isn't 100% dead it should somehow process claims on its own.)


Oh, and if person owns more than 100k USD fuck him, right?
With full-reserve banking (or "self-banking" in case of Bitcoin) your money is safe unless there is outright theft.
With fractional-reserve banking + insurance your money is safe only as long as risk models used to assess quality of loans are sound, and there is NO WAY to guarantee that, as any model utilizes some assumptions which might turn out to be false.


Fees. Majority of electronic payment systems have significant fees, and I'm sure they can survive without lending out deposited money.
That's why I wrote that it should be a choice: high fees, but riskless or low fees, but potentially risky. Why should it be 'one-size-fit-all'?

The thing is, cryptocurrency which is used to "host" colored coins and smart property would be the currency used to buy what is represented with them. Atomic transactions are safest and fastest way to trade these things. Cross-blockchain trade contracts are considerably inferior. And using 3rd party defeats the purpose of using a cryptocurrency in the first place...
So if we want to buy, for example, stocks using Bitcoins, then Bitcoin should be used as a host currency for stocks.


It is seen as a niche application now... 
But colored coins can be used to create decentralized capital markets, i.e. trade stocks and bonds. Potentially they might be bigger than what we see now, because only large corporations make use of traditional capital markets. But decentralized markets can be used for crowdfunding, small-scale businesses etc...
For example, Litcoin Global now lists [TABITA]( which is a small Mexican bakery. They were able to buy a new owen with help of funds they have risen on LTC-GLOBAL. How cute... But to register on LTC-GLOBAL now one needs to pay $325 fee, which might be a bit too much for tiny companies, especially taking into account that success isn't guaranteed.
Colored coins can also be used for derivative markets and currency trade. Which might be huge too as decentralized market will be open for blackmarket capital, insider trading etc.
And it will help to stabilize host currency because one will be able to buy futures to hedge FX risks. E.g. if I pay supplier in USD, but customer pays me in BTC, I can buy USD futures to cover the risk. Automatically, of course.
Smart property and smart vouchers can be used for secure trade of physical things. Smart vouchers can be used for secure and transparent re-selling, for example.
And if some FooCoin will host these things, it would allow people to use capital, derivative, FX markets and retail... As I mentioned, it would be THE currency to trade these things.
And Bitcoin will be, what, just a currency?

The difference between colored coins on top of Bitcoin and external things like Ripple is that colored coins allow you to trade things for Bitcoin directly.
I.e. with Ripple, you have to use some sort of an gateway, i.e. you first trade Bitcoins for Bitcoin-IOU from that gateway, and then trade such IOUs for whatever asset you want.
While in case with colored coins, Bitcoins are represented with Bitcoins.
Think about it: Ripple would allow people to buy stocks with Bitcoin-IOUs, USD-IOUs, XRP etc. 
While with colored coins preferred medium of exchange is actual Bitcoin.
Which do you think is better for Bitcoin?

Why are you barking at the government if there is no difference?


We are talking about pensions here... What do you expect people to do?


This is utter bullshit.
Company's owners are shielded by limited liability, and executives (who are responsible for decisions) are just not liable for losses.
I guess in your imaginary libertardian wonderland owners of a company will always be able to compensate out of their pockets (and they won't go bankrupt), and executives are liable for losses they are responsible for.
But in the reality everybody else is living in, this is just not the case. Limited liability biases payoff function towards risk-taking: if company makes profit, owners and executives will get a nice bonus. If it suffers catastrophic loss... Well, too bad: they'll switch to a different company, but their loss is limited, not as catastrophic as losses of people who they hold money for.
On the other hand, while government is not guaranteed to be efficient, it isn't biased towards risk-taking, and usually there is enough oversight. Even if it manages to fuck up, it will compensate out of budget.
I'm sure at this point you'll scream: "Theft! They take taxpayers money!"

Well, the thing is, we can launch it pretty much now. I mean, some things are lacking, but in theory people can already make use of it. If there is any problem down the road, people can migrate their coins to a different blockchain or to a different technology. (Although I doubt it will be necessary anytime soon.)
So, for me, the choice is obvious: It makes more sense to provide some basic technology ASAP and provide means of migration. Then better technology can be developed at pace it needs.


Many potential issuers are interested in colored coin technology _because_ it might help with the problems Bitcoin has now, particularly: 
 * pegged currencies like USDcoin enable decentralized currency exchange, which means that reliance on centralized exchanges is reduced
 * derivatives (futures, options...) can help to mitigate risks associated with stability, and in this way to help with stabilization
(For example, merchants might fix price  in Bitcoins if they can buy BTC-&gt;USD futures. And such fixed prices help to stabilize exchange rates.)
Doing it on a weird alt-chain will make these things hard if not impossible, so it can be self-defeating.


It might sound  strange, but I doubt that new things can be designed in collectives. You probably know what "design by committee" means... And you know that Satoshi made more-or-less complete system himself, he didn't ask anybody.
In this view, it shouldn't be a decision made by a group. If somebody feels like he knows how to do it right, he should just do it. If it has merit, others will follow.
I have some ideas, but I do not feel like I know how to make a perfect system, so I think it's better to work on something concrete. Field testing can reveal something interesting too...


That idea with foundation is really weird and got me by surprise. It is a lot like Devcoin, but Devcoin advertises it explicitly, while Freicoin did not.
But Jorge has some great idea, so I would not rule it out.
(BTW one overlooked aspect of Freicoin is that 5% of monetary base is awarded to _miners_ each year. Potentially, it is _a lot of money_ (if Freicoin somehow goes big).  So it should be really called MinerCoin :)

Actually, no. 
If pools decide to change the rules, users can tell them to fuck off.
It is hard to tell who decides. Currently developers have the most influence.
But in case of a fork and disagreement about rules, I guess side picked by big business will win. E.g. suppose there are two chains:
 * Bitcoin-A which is supported by MtGox and BitPay
 * Bitcoin-B which isn't supported by large companies
Obviously, Bitcoin-B is much less useful since exchanging them and buying something for them will be a problem. So majority of users will pick Bitcoin-A and Bitcoin-B will be worthless.

But there is a number of threats unique to Bitcoin... Blockchain might be under 51% attack, or maybe there will be a fork due to bug in software.

There are two sides to each trade: whenever someone wins, someone else loses.
In some cases everybody wins in a long term (when company produces a lot of value), but there are other cases where nobody wins. (Scam or failure.)
So I believe investment shouldn't be recommended: People who are qualified already know how to invest. People who aren't qualified are likely to lose their money, or win on pure luck.


Well I know how to do the math, I have a math degree, in fact. But a lot of people cannot do the math, so I think investing shouldn't be recommended to them.

That's not what I'm doing here.
1. We can model a specific situation as a game, in game theoretic sense.
2. Now we know that IF situation X arises, we can expect Y, and taking this into account we can make prediction about a whole system, e. g. if we assume Z, then W. (Because assumption Z means that situation X arises, so we can expect Y, and Y leads to W.)
In the second case I didn't bother to formulate the game, but if it is symmetric then equilibrium is symmetric too.
However, we know from economic experiments that it is not as simple as game theory suggests.

When you run it in VM, Windows controls all input and output, so malware can easily record keystrokes or make screen shots. (Or maybe do other nasty things too...)
In case with dual boot or livecd, Linux will control input and output, so it will be unaffected by Windows malware.
However, dual-boot system might be vulnerable to malware modifying its files or a bootloader. So it is less secure than LiveCD, although I think such kind of attack is very rare, unless somebody targets you personally.
And then there is a possibility that malware will somehow infect BIOS, but, honestly, I haven't heard about such cases.

Well, proper use of Bitcoin protocol _requires_ Internet connectivity because node needs to be able to receive block headers to confirm payment validity. So, in a way, it _is_ "internet money", by definition.
But I think by "internet money" you imply that it would be used by small scale web users... That's not the case.
Bitcoin is in fact perfect currency for large scale settlements, as it doesn't require intermediary (which might fail or be untrustworthy).
So it might be used for large scale unregulated market. I.e. we might see multiple exchanges with billions dollars worth of daily trade volume, with Bitcoin being used for transfers between exchanges, getting money in, cashing out.
In this case Bitcoin's role will be reserve currency used by free market exchanges. That's hardly "internet money".
On the other hand, use in brick &amp; mortar stores is probably least fitting case:
 * Bitcoin consensus mechanism requires some time to confirm payments, which is not acceptable for brick &amp; mortar store use
 * however, we don't need to rely on Bitcoin consensus mechanism as it is possible to rely on 3rd party payment processor
 * so we don't really need to use Bitcoin protocol. 
Basically, people will use Bitcoin-denominated debit card of sorts, but then there is a question -- why Bitcoin? If you rely on 3rd party provider, you can make it gold-denominated or anything.

Of course, it cannot be a reason in and of itself. But by the time ASIC miners appeared, Litecoin already was traded on exchanges, had non-zero value and there was a couple of services accepting it. So GPU miners got an opportunity to switch to Litecoin mining. And once more people got exposed to it, they started to ask business to accept it, open Litecoin-related services etc.
Don't forget that a huge part of appeal of cryptocurrency was that you can mine it yourself. Litecoin has appeal to 'casual' miners who have gaming rigs and do not want to buy dedicated mining hardware (ASICs).


I meant something like 51% attack. You need SHA-256 ASICs to attack Bitcoin, but that won't help you against Litecoin.


Yes, but there is no evidence that interval Satoshi has chosen is perfect.

Currently only larger companies can have their stock being traded on exchanges because becoming a public company requires a lot of paperwork and is not feasible for smaller companies.
Cryptocurrency-based stock trading might remove this barrier, and smaller companies will get access to funding from public.
More investors can participate, too:
 * crypto-based trading works worldwide, so it's possible to invest into foreign companies without much hassle
 * it can be as anonymous as Bitcoin, so people can invest in a private fashion
Now if we're talking about decentralized exchanges:
 * no middleman, small fees
 * no single point of failure
 * no way to block trading or interfere with it
We already have centralized exchanges like btct.co and bitfunder.com, but:
 * to buy stocks people have to send Bitcoins to these exchanges, which can be risky
 * when GLBSE closed a year ago, people got their funds blocked on exchange (although eventually they were released) and migration to other exchanges took several months
 * when a centralized exchange is DDoSed you cannot do anything; but with a decentralized exchange you can trade as long as you have a method of communication, e.g. it might be possible to do this over Bluetooth or NFC
 * during Labcoin IPO some people had negative amount of shares due to "locking issues", and Burnside had to unwind some trades to fix this:






In other words, trading depends on proprietary technology which people cannot examine, and exchange operator has a power to unwind trades etc.
Of course, we cannot guarantee that crypto-based trading will be 100% free of bugs, but trading software can be 100% open source, and it will independently verify correctness of trade, etc.
("Locking issues" are simply impossible, as each transaction exists on its own. Code which verifies correctness of a transactions is relatively small, so it should be possible to give it an extensive review or even do a formal proof of its correctness. )

IT would take billions of years to bruteforce that "simple private key".


Delay doesn't help. Keep in mind that attacker can do everything you can do, so if you can recover coins, he can do that too.
All such resets are just security through obscurity, you do not solve the fundamental problem.
However, don't forget that Bitcoin allows multi-signature scripts, so you can implement arbitrarily complex auth policies with help of third parties.
For example, suppose output requires two signatures: from you and from Bitcoin security provider, VaultCoin Inc. This company will sign spending transaction only under certain conditions. For example, they might call you by phone and ask secret word. Then they sign transaction only after 24h delay, allowing you to cancel transfer before it happens.
So if attacker came to your home with a gun, got your private key and forced you to auth transaction via phone. You still can cancel transaction if you manage to escape.
(Also you can establish another secret word you would use under duress: VaultCoin will say that tx is authorized, but they will instead block it and will call police.)

There is no such thing as a regular double-spend. I guess you mean a race attack 


I believe this difference is non-essential, Finney simply mentioned a simplest case which came to his mind.
The essential difference between Finney and basic race attacks is that Finney attack is miner-assisted, that is miner knows that double-spend is going on.
If you want we can call replace-by-fee a separate class of an attack.


You can make replace-by-fee attack invisible too: submitting a double-spend directly to nefarious miners.

Suppose somebody is selling large amount of physical gold. They will wait 6 confirmations and give you gold.

I think you got this completely wrong... Consider a situation where seller has no chicken eggs, he is neither able nor willing to send them.
There are two options for buyer:
1. 2 BTC goes to seller, 1 BTC goes to buyer. Buyer lost 1 BTC in this transaction.
2. 2 BTC and 1 BTC are forever blocked. Buyer lost 2 BTC.
It is clear that -1 payoff is better than -2 payoff, so optimal strategy is to release money.
Existence of this Nash equilibrium means that being a fake seller is very profitable.
Now, if you use [distributed contracts]( buyer will only have to wager 1 BTC, and in that case Nash equilibrium is no longer profitable for fake seller. However, in practice, different factors might be at plat. For example, buyer would rather pay a small fee than have his funds blocked for prolonged amount of time (e.g. he would prefer to get 0.9 BTC now to 1 BTC later), so it might still be profitable to asshole fake sellers who can afford to wait.

I think company will give you a new certificate in this case, perhaps taking some fee for the hassle. In any case, legally you're still the owner.

Strictly speaking, a successful double-spend can happen after reorganization, and they can happen naturally from time to time. Thus, partnering with some hashpower is _not_ required.
I think stochastic double-spending is often overlooked: most articles I have seen assume that attacker wishes to perform double-spend with success probability close to 1. But attack can be profitable even if success probability is very low.
Suppose you have 100 BTC which you periodically deposit to and withdraw from an exchange. If transfer fee is 0.0001 BTC, I can do that 10000 times before wasting a whole bitcoin. If attack success rate is higher than 0.01%, it's worth it.
@_date: 2013-03-01 21:09:03
Changes to Bitcoin rules can happen and will happen. For example, currently fees are optional, but it's likely that network will adopt some fee schedule.
If that fee schedule will take into account storage time, effectively we'll have coin expiration: if required fee is higher than output's value, that output can be forgotten.

You aren't relying on proof-of-work? Then fuck you.
@_date: 2013-04-08 07:13:11
Bitcoin shouldn't be used directly for point-of-sale solutions. It isn't optimized for that. Accepting transactions with zero confirmations IS NOT SAFE. It isn't convenient.
It makes much more sense to pre-fill a shared wallet within some kind of payment processor, and then use it to pay merchants who accept this payment processors. Payments won't produce transactions on blockchain, so fee on them will be unrelated to Bitcoin fees.
Bitcoin will keep you savings in safety. But filling like $10 into a shared wallet isn't a big problem.

You can easily do this with deterministic wallets: seed can be created from combination of password and data from file. So different passwords will naturally give you different seeds.

For those who haven't heard about colored coins yet, it is basically like [bitcoin stock exchange]( but information about ownership of securities is stored in Bitcoin blockchain.
Also you can buy and sell securities via so-called 'atomic coin swapping' transactions which are secure in the sense that seller cannot fool buyer and vice versa: transaction is valid only if both sign it, and they test that everything is right before signing.
ArmoryX p2ptrade implements this secure buying/selling protocol. p2ptrade GUI aims to mimic 
It uses HTTP protocol for networking, it isn't P2P at all, but it is possible to make it decentralized without changing much. Anyway, networking is the least important part, all the magic happens on client.

This is very lightly tested, but seems to work.
p2ptrade is largely just a proof of concept at this point, there are several known deficiencies.

There is nothing exotic about it, these contracts just use confusing terminology.
For example, if you buy 10 contracts  it actually means you're selling $100 USD for 0.007 BTC each.
If you sell 10 contracts  it actually means that you buy $100 USD for 0.006 BTC each.
It is easy to calculate your profit in this case: 
VM = -(0.006 - 0.007) * 100 = 0.1 BTC.

It is very unlikely that government is against Google paying to Argentinian developers. Money which enters the country is always a good thing. Chances are that lawmakers didn't actually mean to ban such activities, they are just incompetent and wanted a different thing like tighter control, curbing illegal exports etc. So absolutely nobody will be pissed off if Google finds some way.

Gavin got terminology wrong: (in context of _supply and demand_) _supply_ does not mean total amount of something, _supply_ means amount which is available on market. From wikipedia:


Alt-coins do not directly affect Bitcoin supply, for obvious reasons. They affect it indirectly, though, through complex market interactions.
Another problem with this article is that Gavin comes up as a person who is emotional about economic phenomena. I mean, existence of alt-coins is a fact. Apparently, there is some demand for them, and so people produce them in quantities because it costs very little.
We should not **hate** this phenomenon, we should **study** it. 
If you assumed that only Bitcoin will exist, your model was outright wrong. You should adapt your model, not bark at it.
There are valid reasons to dislike alt-coins, for example:
 * they waste of resources 
 * they add no value
 * they prey on misinformed people
But "they fuck up my supply&amp;demand model" is not a valid reason, sorry.

Most of all we need people who have in-depth understanding of the Bitcoin protocol. Of course, what we do goes beyond the Bitcoin protocol, but I assume that if person had no problems with the Bitcoin protocol, he won't have problems with what we do either.
Ideally developer should also understand inner workings of Bitcoin wallet software, and be good at object-oriented design. Understanding of cryptography / crypto protocols is a bonus too.
As for languages, they are Python (for NGCCC project) and JS (for WebcoinX project).
Later we'll have tasks for people without this in-depth knowledge. For example, they can implement user interface and things like that. 
But currently we're refactoring/redesigning the core of these wallets, and there are no small/easy tasks.
Here's a sample of what we're doing:
1. [The theory of colored coins]( description of concepts which go into colored coin protocol.
2. NGCCC [wallet model]( (incomplete, it doesn't work yet)
3.  order-based coloring [color kernel implementation]( (in coloredcoinlib, part of NGCCC)
4. [outdated overview of NGCCC architecture](
5. [WebcoinX p2ptrade GUI part](
6. [WebcoinX wallet 'send' implementation](

Most likely we'll know that ECDSA is weak way before there will be practical ways to crack it, so we'll have some time to upgrade. Everybody will need to send they money to a new wallet which uses different signature scheme.
However if somebody will find a way to crack ECDSA right away, it will be really bad.
Hard fork doesn't help here because you need a way to authenticate the original owner. But if ECDSA is broken, attacker will be able to make transaction as if he was  an owner.
Well, OK. If ECDSA is broken, but SHA-256 isn't, it is possible to upgrade with help of honest miners: basically, if you know that miners are on your side, you will send your transaction directly to miners in encrypted form, so others cannot see it.
But you need honest miners to be in majority, agreeing with each other to do this upgrade in proper fashion.
If SHA-256 is broken w.r.t. preimage attack, it is basically a 'game over'.

Bitcoin coin is actually an "unspent transaction output". You need to keep them. That's how it works. There is no other way around without changing everything.
The problem is that people think that they need to keep UTXOs in memory, while it is theoretically possible to keep them on disk.

1.  Script from BitAddress.org might be modified (potentially by a trojan on your PC) to use a reduced pool of entropy. 2^64 keyspace still looks random, but it is easy to scan it all if you know how it is generated.
2. Printer might store information... Also it is hard to install printer... Write things down BY HAND. Takes some time, but it's way more secure.

It is fairly straightforward:
1. Send money to exchange1 as you do normally.
2. Generate 6 blocks on the main chain, or just wait 1 hour.
3. Exchange1 unblocked your deposit, so you can exchange and withdraw a different currency.
4. Pay same coins to exchange2 on a sidechain.
5. Mine ~7 blocks of sidechain to trigger a reorg.
6. After reorg exchange2 will see your deposit and you can exchange &amp; withdraw again.


But we ARE talking about 51% attack here, no need to target "separate network fragments".
OP mentioned a scenario where miners keep their hardware off most of the time. When hardware is off, attacker can generate ~12 blocks to have a double spend.
Of course, after that miners will wake up... But damage is already done.

What's about banks, payment system, etc.? Bitcoin means lost revenue if it becomes widely used.

Bitcoin blockchain contains transactions which record transfer of ownership, this allows us to know the current owner of Bitcoin without any reliance on centralized entity.
Same can work for any securities: if certain kind of transactions records transfer of securities, they can be organized into a blockchain so it will be possible to find current owner.
It isn't exactly "a stock exchange", but if we have reliable, decentralized representation of ownership like described above, it is possible to implement  (with help of cryptography and things like that) something which will work like a stock exchange, but will be decentralized.
So this dude is right. Bitcoin is like a proof-of-concept, it implements the simplest thing, i.e transfer of fungible units of something (Bitcoin). Once you have this mechanism you can add complexity to it, i.e. add rules, differentiate between units, etc.
As you might know, Satoshi started experimenting with it by making a fairly complex Script language. Currently 95% of it is unused, but it can be used for some form of contracts... And, of course, in theory it is possible to develop even more powerful script language.
So, again, it isn't like we mis-using Bitcoin: Satoshi himself anticipated that this concept can be used for variety of things, but for the start he implemented a currency with simple transactions. I guess because it is the simplest thing, and has biggest impact.

Basically a Bitcoin client can work in one of three modes:
1. Full node with full blockchain: downloads and stores whole blockchain. Can verify transactions, can relay transactions, can be used for mining. Can help other full nodes to initialize.
2. Full node with pruning: stores only UTXO set, i.e. a list of unspent coins. This requires much less disk space, but you still need to download the whole blockchain. Can be used for everything full node can be used, but it cannot help other full nodes to initialize.
3. Client using Simplified Payment Verification: Cannot verify transactions on its own. But it can check whether transaction was included into blockchain. If it was, it can assume that transaction is valid. Obviously, it only verifies transactions which belong to its wallet and doesn't help the network in any way.
So, the first client developed by Satoshi was full node with full blockchain: when blockchain size is small it isn't a problem, and having many of such full nodes running makes network stable.
Later people implemented pruning for bitcoind/Bitcoin-Qt, so in theory it can ditch historic parts of blockchain, dramatically reducing on disk size... But IIRC removal of parts of blockchain isn't yet implemented in version 0.8.
Finally, when blockchain size started to matter, people implemented SPV clients. It was first implemented in BitcoinJ library by Mike Hearn. This library is used by MultiBit and Bitcoin Wallet for Android.
Later we got Electrum... And possibly other clients too.
Anyway, "default client" is **not** recommended for new users now. It is for power users, merchants and miners.
Normal people can should use Electrum, MultiBit or something like that.
Finally, protocol can be updated so that full nodes won't need to download whole blockchain. But it requires fairly serious modification of protocol and it might have negative security implications, so such change is debatable.

The problem I see with this reasoning is that you're trying to force things. You want everybody to use Bitcoin.
But let's be honest, right now it is not for everyone.
Why do we need to make it seem easier than it is?
It isn't like people are so stupid that they think only things they can buy groceries with are money.
Say, people understand that they cannot pay for groceries with money on their savings account or with PayPal. They need to use credit card or cash.
Likewise, they can understand that they cannot use Bitcoin to buy groceries directly, AND THAT'OK. It is still a kind of money, just like money on savings account is money.

Do not deposit all your bitcoins into one address: if your computer is compromised, attacker will be able to get all your coins.
Instead you should spread your coins over many paper wallets. Say, 0.5 BTC each.
Now, to pay  0.9 BTC you need to scan 2 paper wallets. You can keep the change (0.1 BTC) in your online wallet (e.g. Mycellium): it certainly sucks if they'll get stolen, but at least you'll know when your device will be compromised. If you do it this way, you will lose less than 0.5 BTC, which is better than losing 0.5 BTC when you scan it.
This compartmentalization is absolutely crucial, without it you have roughly same kind of security as with password-protected wallet.

1. Bitcoin proof-of-work algorithm works as long as you're connected to at least one real node (which is connected to the rest of the network). E.g. if you're connected to 7 impostors and 1 real node, chains provided by impostors will be rejected because total work of their chains will be less than total work of current best chain which real node can provide.
2. If you already had client running previously, it will remember many nodes it already connected to. It's pretty hard to take down all these nodes (without hijacking networking altogether). It also remembers best chain, so impostors will have to beat it to fool you, and that's pretty expensive.
3. Situation is different for a node who is joining the network for the first time. He has to rely on [bootstrapping](
4. Suppose somebody manages to isolate a new node which connects for the first time, and he connects to a fake node. It won't accept fake chain, though, if it isn't based on checkpoints which are periodically added to code by developers.
So let's summarize possible attacks:
1. New node: attacker needs to circumvent normal bootstrapping and force client to connect to his fake node. In this case he will be able to make client follow his fake chain based on the most recent checkpoint. However, it is computationally expensive to create such a fake chain. Attacker can trick that new node's user into accepting fake payment, but he needs to make 6 blocks to do that. It doesn't make sense unless we are talking about a large sum of money, or somehow has access to many such new clients at once. Add to this that it will take a while for an attacker to mine 6 blocks, so users might notice something fishy is going on (it takes many days to get 6 confirmations instead of one hour).
2. Node which previously connected to the network: more or less the same thing as above, but harder for an attacker, as he needs to isolate client from _all_ the nodes. And he needs to build on top of last best chain known to node, which requires more work.
Note that if user have found out that he is under attack, he just needs to connect to one real Bitcoin node. It isn't hard.
tl; dr: Network attacks are possible, for example, ISP can pull it off. But highly impractical: expensive, takes a lot of time, user can find out that something is fishy.

I think we can start with making upgrade to Lamport signatures optional: 
1. A new kind of P2SH includes Merkle tree root hash of multiple scripts rather than a single script hash. In a degenerate case it is just a hash of a script like before.
2. One who redeems can choose any script from the tree.
3. Thus you can create two scripts: one using ECDSA, another using Lamport signature and include both into P2SH.
4. If everything is OK you use ECDSA script and key.
5. If ECDSA is cracked, you redeem via Lamport keypair without revealing anything ECDSA related.
Perhaps we'll have space-efficient quantum-resistant signature schemes in future, then it will be possible to switch to it via intermediate step with Lamport signatures, without going fully Lamport.

Pretty much all Bitcoin software is sub-standard, it is has proof-of-concept kind of quality: it is possible to demonstrate that it works, but it provides no guarantees of any sort.
After you click 'send' in a typical Bitcoin wallet, it creates, signs and broadcasts a transaction... There is no attempt to make sure that it gets to the recipient , no status indication aside from confirmations.
This isn't how it should work. There is a protocol designed to fix this issue: [BIP 0070]( Please take some time to read at least 'Motivation' section: it is very easy to understand.
The real problem is with users who do not care about quality: they see that a demo works and think it's OK, they do not care if it is reliable as it there is no easy way to check that.
Also there is a problem with 'optimism': developers have warned that Bitcoin is NOT good for point-of-sale solutions, but users do not care about that: they start pushing it to merchants right after they see that demos work. Of course, everybody wants to see Bitcoin price going to the moon _right now_, and so they need adoption among merchants. So they're trying to push it despite reliability concerns. (OP, thank these assholes for your experience and monetary loss.)
Some blame lies on developers and companies which employ them: a protocol like BIP-0070 is fairly easy to implement, but it's simply not a highest priority. Developers want to work on something new and shiny, companies want something which brings users... Reliability has very low priority.
Anyway... Bitcoin **was not designed** for point-of-sale situations. It was designed for online payments which aren't critical to timing. If you use an ordinary wallet and your experience sucks, that's how it is supposed to be. If it doesn't suck, well, you were lucky. It is possible to tune it to behave better, but this takes time: at very least we need to use something like BIP-0070, but to make it perfectly smooth you need a somewhat centralized solution (\*). Meanwhile, please do not push it: it is simply not ready, it will show Bitcoin in a bad light and it hurts people.
\*: Suppose a merchant uses a Bitcoin-based payment system A, while you use B. When you make a payment  bitcoins are sent via B, and if A trusts B, payment can be instantaneous. It isn't fully centralized as you aren't forced to use certain provider, you still have a choice. A doesn't need to trust B unconditionally: they might hold money in a multi-signature output, so there is no way for B to fool A. Of course, using a 100% decentralized system to buy a coffee sounds cool, but isn't it better to have secure, reliable, instantaneous payments?

It isn't a big problem because any Bitcoin company can also use fiat money. If borrowing Bitcoins is more expensive than borrowing USD one can just borrow USD.
But if we consider only part of Bitcoin economy which prefers to use Bitcoin capital markets, I'd say some companies can already observe negative effects...
Some people borrowed Bitcoins when they were around $13 and invested into meat-world ventures. Now they cannot repay debt when Bitcoins are around $130... Unless their ROI is 10+, which is very rare for meat-world ventures.
So you see that people who used borrowed capital suffered, while people who simply held their Bitcoins benefited. Will you say that it is healthy for the economy?
Another aspect is that cost of capital is much higher in Bitcoin world... Bonds need to offer high interest rate, P/E of stocks is like 2...
Now common sense tells you that if your venture is meat-space, you should use fiat.

**THE** proper solution for feature phones is **J2ME**. It is ubiquitous (I had J2ME on a cheapo Siemens phone I bought in 2004) and it can do cryptography on device, so it can be like a proper Bitcoin wallet, not a web site which claims to be a wallet.
I'm fairly certain that you can replicate security of blockchain.info with J2ME.

Basically, two parties send their money to an "address" which will have, say, 2 BTC.
To spend coins from that address signatures of both parties are required.
So it is up to them to decide what transaction to sign. For example, parties A and B might decide that:
1. 1 BTC goes to A, 1 BTC goes to B.
2. 0.9 BTC goes to A, 1.1 BTC goes to B.
3. 0 BTC goes to A, 2 BTC goes to B.
Basically, whatever they both agree too will happen.
It is also possible that they won't ever come to an agreement, then 2 BTC will be blocked forever.

Hardware wallet makes sense only if you have end-to-end security, i.e. there is an invoice which is signed by recipient and there is a way to verify this identity.
E.g. it should be able to display "You're paying 1 BTC to alpacasocks.com" when invoice is signed with alpacasocks.com SSL cert. In this case you know that you pay to the merchant.
Without this MitM attacks are possible and feasible. Suppose your hardware wallet asks "Should we pay 1 BTC to 16UwLL9Risc3QfPqBUvKofHmBQ7wMtjvM?"
Now how do you know whether 16UwLL9Risc3QfPqBUvKofHmBQ7wMtjvM is merchant's address or attackers address?
Unless you want to memorize addresses of all merchants, you cannot know that, and so somebody can steal your payments even if you're using hardware wallet.
So what we get is that a practically useful hardware wallet needs to implement some invoicing protocol with some PKIX analog. And this is fairly complex stuff, and it will require updates from time to time.
And in any cases, transactions you're going to sign are not different from "accepting incoming data from internet".
So... It's a bit nuanced. Term you're looking for is 'attack surface'. 
If you're using a piece of hardware which is dedicated for one single purpose, attack surface is smaller and so it is easier to secure it.
But what we get from it is that it is probably possible to do that with smartphone or laptop: one just needs to dedicate it for transaction signing.
Actually I think that feature phone can make a good hardware wallet: they are cheap, locked down, can do wireless data transfer...

Mastercoin client does the same. Except that there is no certainty about specification, so one client can show that you received 10, another will show that you received 0, and both are right.

Actually it is a parameter associated with a transaction output... Transaction outputs are sometimes called coins.
They actually behave similar to coins: say, to pay $1 with coins you need to select coins with total amount higher than $1.
Likewise, to pay 1 BTC a bitcoin wallet selects txouts with total value higher than 1 BTC.

Well, check applications like blockchain.info wallet. It's really critical to be able to review all JS.


I don't think it is true. You need to send much less data over wire when you handle presentation on the client side. And JavaScript is definitely capable of concatenating some strings, performance-wise.
Did you do any benchmarking to back your claims?


This is utter bullshit. Yes, you can return a script, but if your JS code doesn't inject that script into a page and doesn't evaluate it, this script won't be executed. You know, you see code on github but it doesn't mean that your browser executes it.


It is definitely fine, but not if you need to claim that your web site if provably fair.
To make sure that it is fair I need to be able to inspect all scripts and all communications.


Yes, but as OP have noted, you can inject JS at any stage, and we cannot monitor all data you send to all users, so you can fudge the game with low probability of getting caught.
But I would agree that probability of getting caught is still there, so there is some value in "provably fair" design.
Still, you probably want to do it the way blockchain.info is doing it if you want to be more trusted. (Not that I care much...)

They need Bitcoin-&gt;local currency conversion, as they receive Bitcoins from abroad and need to give people local currency.
Exchange like MtGox has many players who trade with each other. That won't work for a local remittance operator because a local market for Bitcoin can be biased (i.e. too few people want to buy Bitcoins in that location).
So again, Bitcoin remittance works like this: local remittance office receives Bitcoins, _sell them on exchange_, get local currency and pay to local recipients.

You misunderstood what I'm saying...
ASIC mining device market was immature in 2013: small, inexperienced companies produced relatively inefficient devices (e.g. ASICMINER start with 130nm: it is a very old tech process) to cut upfront costs and get first to market.
In 2014 we'll see devices manufactured using modern process (28nm, 20nm), manufactured in large quantities. It will no longer be the case that you need to pre-order and pray that shipment isn't delayed.
Thus miners will be able to buy as many devices as they want/need. Market will be saturated.
Of course, eventually we'll see even more efficient hardware, but difference between 20nm and 14nm won't be as drastic as the difference between 130nm and 20nm.

Value of Bitcoin is accounted separately.

Cool story, bro.
But the fact is, ASICMINER's financial capital is constrained to fraction of their mining revenue.
It is important to understand that shares are already sold, and so price of these shares doesn't in any way affect the capital available to ASICMINER (unless they will choose to dilute existing shareholders).
On the other hand, financial capital available to competitors isn't constrained.
Let's do some math. Total amount of Bitcoins to be mined in 2013 (sans fees): 1.3 million. If ASICMINER has 20% of hashrate, they will get 262K BTC. If 1 Bitcoin is worth $100 USD, they get $26M USD, and invest $13M into new deployments. That's not bad.
But the thing is, competitors are not constrained in this way. If it is profitable, they might invest like $200M USD. Why not?
If you take into account that ASICMINER doesn't own any secret technology (they do same thing everybody else is doing, they were just more lucky and more organized), at that point they won't be able to keep their percentage of hashrate. (Which will basically trigger a vicious cycle: lower percentage means even less capital available.)
This is why they sell equipment: it is crucial for them to get extra capital early on, so they have better chances.
As for competitors, they cannot decide whether to have them or not, it is simply a fact.

This is a frequently asked question...
A separate blockchain has very few advantages, but considerable disadvantages. Particularly, running on top of bitcoin chain specifically allows buying shares/bonds/etc with Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-01-05 00:23:06
OK, let's clarify this.
I did a fair amount of research aiming to make my own alt-chain. Particularly, I investigated what can be done about 51% attack. Things like proof-of-stake, for example.
This might sound crackpot-ish, but you can easily check that I had multiple meaningful discussions on bitcointalk (particularly, with Mike and Jeff), so I do, in fact, have an in-depth understanding of the protocol.
However, I disagree about "splitting the network" problem. Basically, core Bitcoin team members assume that best chain must be found automatically, using certain algorithm, without human intervention. I believe that human intervention is acceptable.
We can see it as a trade-off: what kind of human intervention is acceptable?
"No intervention at all" is NOT an answer. Human must install software, human must update software, human must check that version he install is trustworthy.
So it is simply a fact that Bitcoin network's health relies on human actions.
Then why do we avoid any explicit intervention? Wouldn't it be better to embrace it?
I want to know when shit happens, automatic resolution is a bad thing in situation like that.


Well, somebody needs to update software from time to time anyway. There are bugs, there are protocol updates and so on.
"Different, non-compatible version of blockchain" are a problem only when somebody double-spends. And only if you ship goods before you detect double-spend.
But if client will be able to detect network split and double spend before it shows that transaction is confirmed, no damage is done.
Yes, if client enters panic mode you likely need to update software, but that's just the cost of doing business. There is no software which requires no updates. Maybe there will be some down time like once per year, it is not a big deal.
Don't forget that bitcoin transaction might get no confirmations for hours. People simply have to deal with delays if they use bitcoin.
So, well, if core developers will realize that splitting the network isn't such a big deal they might as well fix bugs in protocol and allow different implementations to interoperate.
So I'm proposing a fix to the current shitty situation where we have to keep compatibility with particular version of Bitcoin software, and you say it's a bad thing, LOL.


I'm definitely not cheerleading, I simply have different opinion. My involvement in alt-chain scene clearly shows that I'm not a big fan of current version of Bitcoin protocol.
So you misunderstood me from the start. You simply assumed that I'm "cheerleading" without even considering other options. Then you called me an ass for no good reason. I demand an apology.


I never said it's trivial, I just said that network split isn't _that_ bad.
Suppose miners who use software X will create a block which won't be recognized as valid by software Y. What happens?
Well, if miners who use software X are in minority, at some point they will realize their mistake. It is a loss of revenue for them, but nobody promised uninterrupted stream of revenue, right?
If miners who use software X are in majority it's a bit worse. Suppose some users have X-compatible clients and other have Y-compatible. They will see different chains.
But still transactions generally appear in both chains, so it is not a problem until someone double-spends.
It is very well possible that it will be solved peacefully: Y-miners will notice that their block get orphaned, they will investigate the problem and either X-software or Y-software will be fixed and updated. Only miners experience loss, for users there is almost no difference.
Double-spending is far from trivial: you need to be aware of split, you need a buddy among X miners, you need to know that merchant uses Y.
Your buddy will insert transaction which sends money to yourself into chain X, then you need to pay merchant. Merchant will see confirmation via chain Y and send you goods.
Later miners realize that chain Y is wrong and you end up with money and goods, while merchant gets nothing.
However, this attack works only if:
1. nobody will extract transactions from X blocks and submit them into Y
2. merchant's client software won't detect split network situation
Both things are pretty much trivial to implement. Even if client sees block as invalid, it still should go through it and extract valid transactions and resubmit them if they are new.


Or maybe I understand it better than you do.
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:17:25
Quantity matters in this case... If you need to hijack a specific miner, you can try to attack until it works... So you have a plenty of time for your shenanigans.
But if you need to hijack 10 miners, you have to attack them at the same time. And it is hard: By the time you find something which gets third miner, first will already repair the damage.
Do you understand what kind of attacks I'm talking about?
Let's take, for example, physical violence... Some thugs can beat shit out of pool operator until he gives them control. It doesn't cost that much to hire thugs.
But attacking 10 pool operators at the same time is considerably more complex.

Well, it is stored in database on blockchain.info web site.


So while it's true you aren't sending them a note like a personal email, if they do happen to look at the transaction in the blockchain they can read the attached note.

If colored coins are used to represent debt securities, normally a contract will look like this:


Where redemption procedure can be specified like this:










If you performed this redemption procedure, but issuer did not send you money, you can try to sue him (as you have a proof that you performed redemption procedure correctly).

Let me explain it in more detail:
Namecoin has this potential problem because it is effectively an independent blockchain which just reuses Bitcoin proof-of-work, and _Namecoin reorganizations can happen even in absence of Bitcoin reorganizations_. 
That is, a malicious miner can can cause a Namecoin reorganization by reusing his Bitcoin PoW without also causing Bitcoin reorganization.
It is possible to get rid of this problem if you give up independence and rely on Bitcoin block ordering instead. (EDIT: it looks like it is usually called _sidechains_.) It has same properties as _parasitic consensus systems_ and thus can be classified as such, but the difference is that its footprint in the Bitcoin blockchain is exactly the same as for merged-mined alt-chain, and, moreover, on the Bitcoin side it uses same mechanisms as merged-mining.
So it is basically a hybrid between parasitic consensus system and merged-mining:
1. consensus has same properties as consensus of a parasitic consensus system
2. footprint is same as footprint of merged-mining
However, it is a trade-off, and the price is potentially slower confirmation time. E.g. if 10% of Bitcoin miners participate in this sidechain mining, then confirmations are 10x slower than Bitcoin confirmations.

Here's a recap:
1. A month ago or so we started to have problems with Bitcoin exchanges. Particularly, MtGox disabled USD withdrawals, but also MtGox was flagged by major banks as being associated with LR and money laundering, etc.
2. People got cautious, some of them started selling their Bitcoins and withdrawing. Price went from $130 we saw in the end of may to $90 we saw on 1st of July.
3. On 4th of July MtGox announced that it got many new banking partners, and withdrawal was re-enabled. A lot of people took an opportunity to withdraw (it looks like moving to other exchanges wasn't an option for them), so price went down to $68 on 5th of July. Also I believe many was discouraged by price going down.
3. By 7th of July sell-off was complete and people started buying. We saw it going back to $75.
4. Now everybody who wanted to quit already left, others see price climbing up and started buying.
5. So now we got it going from $65 at bottom to $105 today.
6. Yes, there are positive news, of course, there are new ways to buy Bitcoin etc. But it isn't why it gained $40 in 5 days, it simply recovers from damage it got in June. I won't be surprised if it keeps gaining $5 per day or so, till we hit $130. Then it will either slow down, or we'll see another rally.

Well, I'm currently working on decentralized p2p exchange (based on colored coins). It can be adapted for auctions too.
There are many challenges, of course, but I don't see why it is necessarily worse than a centralized solution. Especially if centralized can exist as a particular form of decentralized.
The thing is, when you have trading platform separate from choice of listing service and dispute mediation, you can get better service due to competition.
Ebay is a popular platform, it has many users, so it is attractive for merchants... But it is bundled with a certain payment system, with dispute mediation and with certain ToS.
However, with decentralized platform we can have multiple companies offering listing services and dispute mediation companies.

WTF are you talking about? Did you read my comment?
IF miners were independent, it would be the case that someone needs to 
"spend a million bitcoin to engage in a 51% attack and steal 1000 bitcoin".
But with pooled mining, double spend attack might as well cost you NOTHING, and THIS is a problem, it undermines fundamental assumptions.


That's bullshit, competitors might want to ruin Bitcoin because they get bigger profits from their business.


You do not understand how it works.
Costs might be negligible, but you can make a lot of money shorting Bitcoin.
Borrow lots of Bitcoins, sell them,  perform such attack, buy back cheap Bitcoins, pocket the difference.

In your country they do. But there are other countries, bro.


Acquiring Bitcoins is easy (you can get money into btc-e account via cash terminal), and once you have Bitcoins you can use them however you want, nobody can ask you anything.
I purchase domain names with Bitcoins, for example. I have two debit cards with money on them, but it's just easier to use Bitcoins.
On the receiving side, in my country PayPal can only be used to spend money. Receiving money from a foreign country is problematic. International wire transfer is pretty much the only legal option. And if it is related to commercial activity, wire transfer needs to be backed by a 10-page contract.
So I need to waste $30 on wire transfer and two hours of my life on printing &amp; scanning contract.
Or I could use Bitcoin transfer, which is almost free and requires no paperwork.


I mentioned three in the post above.
Anything which requires both getting money from users and sending money to users is problematic with 'fiat' currencies, but is easy with bitcoins.

This was very condescending and totally uncalled for.
I'm well aware of Popper's philosophy of science, and I know a bit about math and models, being an applied mathematician, you know.
I can elaborate a bit: Currently fiscal policy is designed around
 * capabilities of monetary policy, which allows monetary base expansion as it is based on a fiat money
 * macroeconomic models which you probably identify as "Keynesian"
If it is designed this way, then it makes sense to advocate stimulus if model says it optimizes qualities we want. What's the other option, disregard model and rely on butt feeling?
Now let's consider a hypothetic situation where Bitcoin largely replaced fiat currencies. Obviously, it's not possible to continue using same fiscal policies as monetary expansion is no longer an option.
However, it is possible to take new new monetary policy capabilities (or lack of thereof) and redesign fiscal policy around it.
The thing is, it's possible to use same macroeconomic models which you call Keynesian. For example, government might borrow Bitcoins and increase government spending to prop up economy.
So, basically, you cannot rule out "Keynesian" models just because of Bitcoin.
Yes, maybe they need to be updated. Maybe they need complete overhaul, or they are totally inadequate.
But you cannot know that for sure, you cannot say that some other model is definitely better.
So what you wrote [here]( makes no sense: you assumed that government would keep its fiscal policies intact.
But, obviously, "Keynesian economics" isn't just what government is doing right now; it is a theory, first of all, and you haven't demonstrated that theory itself won't be applicable, you only criticized existing policies.

No. You got this wrong.
Currently, three parties need to be involved in trading:
1. investor
2. issuer
3. exchange/platform operator
With decentralized p2p exchanges (enabled by colored coins), we can remove the need for a 3rd party, so it will be a thing between investor and issuer. (Investors can trade with each other too. But they indirectly have to rely on soundness of an investment vehicle. They do not need to rely on issuer to facilitate trade, though.)
Of course, issuer and investor still might have problems with regulators. But now regulators won't be able to shut it all down. Investors can be anonymous, so it is hard to regulate them. Issuers can use some tricks to avoid regulatory problems, e.g. they can use an offshore company as an owner.
People already use offshore trusts to hide their wealth. You know, Mitt Romney admits to use it, and he had no problems so far.
Also huge multinational corporations use offshore structures to reduce tax burden. Particularly, public companies, which have to work with regulators and have to report to investors.
So it looks like moving ownership offshore is OK.
IANAL, etc.


No, it doesn't make transactions more trackable.
Existing exchanges keep logs, and so they associate all your trades  with your Bitcoin address and email and IP.
On the other hand, trades made via colored coins record only Bitcoin addresses, and you're free to use mixing and things like that to cloak your identity.

Hmm, I don't see how it can work... What are we going to compute?
However, it is possible to do this using zero-knowledge proofs... Basically, only person who provided an input should be allowed to submit an output, but others shouldn't be able to deduce which input was his.
I think it is even possibly to use Zerocoin protocol for it: 'mint' operation for each input, 'spend' for each output.
There is a possibility that somebody will submit an input, but won't sign the transaction. Then his input can be banned and process restarts... So eventually we'll get to the point where everybody signs the transaction, as long as there are people who are interested in mixing.
So, basically, it is possible to use Zerocoin without adding it to Bitcoin protocol. The benefit is that vulnerabilities in protocol can have only very limited impact. Particularly, it is impossible that coins will be stolen.
The drawback is that mixing is done over small time frame and so pool of coins used in mixing is relatively small.

It isn't.
There is a fundamental problem with it: Every client needs to receive all messages, since earlier messages affect later messages, and so if you miss even one message, you get to a wrong state.
This means that secure thin clients are not possible.
 * It can work only for full clients (like Bitcoin-Qt)
 * and for server-trusting clients (i.e. server you connect to can rob you, which defeats the whole point of cryptocurrency)
With ever-growing blockchain size means that running a full client will be pretty involved, so I really don't see how it can have a future.

Don't forget that there are several independent full node implementations. Maybe they are not 100% identical, but 99.9% identical.
Bitcoin is considerably different from TCP/IP. With TCP/IP, if it works, it works. With Bitcoin, you want mining nodes to be 100% identical in all critical aspects

Well, and now we have a lot of alt-coins with _exactly same properties_ except brand, infrastructure and hashpower... Don't forget that Namecoin has 90% of Bitcoin's hashpower.
So do they all have same intrinsic value?
Frankly, I think "intrinsic value" is bullshit. Krugman's article mentioned 'floor', it's easier to find it in liabilities which must be paid in bitcoins...
E.g. suppose there was a company which agreed to pay $15M in bitcoins on January 1, 2015. This means that Bitcoin price can't be lower than $1 on that day, so just one smallish payout can provide some floor.
If we had bigger stock/bond/derivative market, it would already be the case that after price moves, somebody owes somebody else bitcoins and need to buy them on market, so, quite likely, it will stabilize the price.

It is largely irrelevant for bitcoind now when people have discovered ultraprune: We can keep DB of unspent transaction outputs and nuke whole blocks. No need to erase individual transactions.
So Merkle Tree is simply used to compute hash of transactions, that's all.
Merkle Tree might be relevant again if people will implement proper SPV (simplified payment verification) which links transaction to the block.
Basically it works like this: a thin client requests info about transaction, and node replies with a block header, transaction and relevant Merkle tree nodes which link transaction to block header.
Client will then re-compute Merkle tree hashes to verify that it is the case.

OK, can you explain me how it works and how to use it?


Marginal costs of one transaction is small. If you can buy a cheeseburger for Bitcoins, buying shares shouldn't be a problem either.


I think it is a bad idea. If somebody issued and sold bonds, he owes people money... Do you want him to manage list of creditors? There is an obvious conflict of interest.
Quite often such issuers go missing or stop responding... That means it won't be possible to trade via system they manage. However, it still makes sense to trade after issuer's default: somebody can buy debt with discount and then go after issuer with a legal action. It is not feasible for a small bondholder to do that, but it is feasible for a bigger one.
Worse than that, nefarious issuer can do many nasty things. For example, through double-spending sell more bonds than were issued. Or just revert transactions of legitimate bondholders and direct funds to his accomplices.
Sure, wrongdoing will eventually be obvious. But issuer can always claim that his server was hijacked. (Which can actually happen, by the way.)
in any case, he will have more liabilities than were implied by contract, which means that each bondholder gets a smaller share of proceedings from liquidation.
So it is obvious that we should only trust issuer to follow the contract, but we shouldn't trust him to do clearing. It should be done by impartial party...
I thought that should be simple until I saw an incident on forum: piotr_n established and advertised a contract management system which just tracked who owns what with help of PGP. The problem is, when one asset issuer said something piotr_n didn't like, he just expelled him from his system...
So I believe we should strive for zero-trust trading platform.
Another factor is cost: if asset issuer manages a clearing service, it costs him money, And it might be hard to protect such centralized service against DDoS attacks.
On the other hand, do not rely on any centralized infrastructure, and carry no costs for issuer aside from price of Bitcoins which go into issuance of colored coins.

No. When you receive 100 individual payments that will create 100 individual coins. Now if you try to send all that amount it will fuse all your coins into one, but transactions which mentions 100 individual inputs is large, so you pay a large fee.

From operation system's perspective, Bitcoin-Qt is just a program which writes reads/writes files and sends data over network. A regular program, that is.
It CANNOT cripple your PC by itself. It is either an operating system bug, or a problem with hardware.
Most likely the later, e.g. a faulty hard disk corrupted both Bitcoin-Qt's files, and operating system's files too. Which "crippled your PC to safe mode".


I believe Electrum is user friendly. And if you use it, you actually own your Bitcoins.

People talk about "stead collapse" for decades, but what we see is that European states are in much, much worse state, but are doing fine. (Aside from Greece... Well, even Greece haven't fully collapsed, even as their situation is several orders of magnitude worse than situation in US.)
And if you consider third world countries (aka the rest of the world), what you would call collapse is a normal state for them. People still live normal lives, they work, they get money for their work, they buy food, computers, electronics, receive healthcare etc.
Two words come to my mind when I see posts like yours: panicky retards. 
You're ignorant, you have no idea how much economy can tolerate because you don't even want to consider foreign countries.

Quite likely because economy was previously artificially propped up by inflationary fiat money. Now it's shrinking to it's normal level, possibly with an overcorrection (i.e. falling under it's normal level).
Do you remember thay Keynesian example with government giving people money to dig holes just to stimulate the economic activities?
Well, it sort of happens now: Government gives cheap loans, invests into various ventures, pays to government employees. This allows people to run companies even if they are not profitable, so this artificially stimulates the economic activity.
When government is no longer able to give money, all this spurious activity vanishes too. Unfortunately, non-spurious activity vanished too. For example, see what happened in Greece: government can no longer borrow money, unemployment is sky-high. It isn't like there is no work for Greek people, it is just that a lot of time needs to pass for them to adjust.
In the scenario described in OP's post, Bitcoin have killed governments, so, understandably, economy shrinks...
I think it would be absurd to claim that economic growth will be -2% per year _forever_, it is just a temporary situation, until economy adjusts to the new reality.


Purchasing power _of what_? Why is it correlated?
When you write things like that, you need to explain where do they come from and why do you believe in them. They are not universally understood facts.


No, that's not how it works. Economic growth is not proportional to change in purchasing power, whatever it is.
There is a lot of difference between correlation and functional relationship like being proportional.
The difference is that correlation is a term from statistics. If we consider 10 cases, and and in 6 cases we see that there is a positive economic growth when there is increase in purchasing power, while in 4 cases you have negative growth, it is still a positive correlation, because _on average_ there is an economic growth.
But it doesn't mean that it is the case each time.
In reality, economic growth is affected by many factors, you cannot claim that just one factor controls it.


There is math more complex than `y = k * x`. It's pretty much hilarious that you're implying that economy is governed by a simple linear equation.
If this was the case it would be super simple to predict everything.
Anyway, how do you explain that US dollar monetary base has increased several times since 2008 by the Fed, but there is no proportional price inflation, in fact it is barely noticeable?

It is better than alternative: using fake addresses to embed data into transactions. That bloats UTXO set. So devs recommend using OP_RETURN instead of that.

You understand nothing about computing performance.
CPU can do billions of operations per second, which means you can easily execute millions of trades per second on single machine. Latency is measured in nanosecond, not microseconds.
However, if you use networking, no matter how fast your code is, you'll have latency on scale of microseconds or even milliseconds. It is 1000...1,000,000 times slower, that is.

Well, there are people who got suspicious of banks, they will just buy Bitcoins to have them. As an alternative to bank deposit, or maybe as a "fuck you", or to diversify. Not necessarily "to make a quick bunk".

No, this isn't true.
Aggregate hashes matter only in context of brute force attack where attacker has more than 50% of hashrate.
But there is a plenty of other models for double-spend attacks. Say, Finney attack might cost attacker nothing, and it can be circumvented by waiting for two confirmations. (Second is needed to guard against a possible race.)
In general, IF attacker cannot afford to get about 50% of the hashrate, all being equal, higher number of confirmations is better.
 &gt; In reality it can happen fairly often with 20% or 30% of the hashrate.
Let's compare...
Suppose attacker has 20% of hashrate... On Bitcoin network people wait for 3 confirmations (30 minutes on average), on Litecoin network they wait for 12 confirmations (30 minutes too).
Probability of mining 3 blocks in a row having 20% of hashrate is 0.8%.
Probability of mining 12 blocks in a row having 20% of hashrate is 0.0000004%.
This means that even if getting 20% of hashrate is million times cheaper, attacker's payoff on Litecoin network is still smaller.

I don't think you understand how Bitcoin works. Attackers do not need to change older blocks to steal your coins, all they need is to **forge your signature**.
Think about it. Read my comment above twice.
If attacker can forge a signature, there is NO WAY to differentiate between legitimate owner and attacker.
Basically, you make a transaction which sends coins to address ABC, attacker makes a transaction which sends to address DEF. Both transactions have valid signature, so it isn't possible to make sure that transaction is sent to address belonging to the original owner.
Got it?

Please note that company which produced this know private keys, and so there is no way to guarantee that Bitcoins will stay there...
Of course, company will claim that private keys were destroyed after printing, but it's just their word. Keys could have been copied by a rogue employee, for example.
So this is just a novelty item: it is shiny, and it has private key... But you have to trust the company.

It is convenient to use web wallet for relatively small sums of money. E.g.: 
For better security you can install their browser extension.
Otherwise you can use Electrum:  I haven't used it much but people say it is good.
Also if you plan to save Bitcoins for a long them, paper wallet is a good idea. But to make sure it is secure, it is better to generate paper wallet on a computer which is disconnected from internet.
Electrum can make a paper wallet, but there also some web sites: 
Basically the idea is that you print out a private key and/or password, and store that piece of paper in a secure place. (Perhaps, several places.)
But you can send money to that address at any time, you can't use it without importing private key in some wallet.
If your computer is already infected with spyware brainwallet won't help: hacker will be able to read private key from screen.
So for maximum security one should boot from LiveCD (e.g. some Linux LiveCD)  on a computer disconnected from network, load some reputable brainwallet generator (e.g. Electrum) and run it. In that case it is physically impossible to steal your bitcoins without stealing that piece of paper.

Finney attack needs to be assisted by miners, but for miners it is 100% hassle-free, they just need to use replace-by-fee patch:
And it can be automatized on clients... Say, each time you buy a cheeseburger from a zero-confirmation accepting merchant, send a replacement tx with higher fee to miners which accept them... Sometimes you will succeed. Yay, free cheeseburger.


This applies only to miners who have less than 50% of hashing power. Once you have 51% you will stop having loss, statistically...

And this is why it is not up to users to decide. Ordinary users have no idea why fees are needed at all...
1. Currently fees are needed largely to prevent spam. In particular, dust attack. Currently blockchain size is 7 GB. If minimum fee is lowered, it might grow much faster. (Hint: if government doesn't like bitcoin it will send a fuckton of transactions bloating blockhain for everyone.) There is a difference between 7 GB blockchain and 7 TB blockchain. Right now everybody can do full verification, but if blockchain size is 7 TB only professional users will.
2. In future (perhaps in 8 years) fees will affect network security. Higher fees = more hashrate = double-spend attack is costlier = it is harder for government to shut down or discredit Bitcoin.
So in both cases higher fees mean healthier network.
But fucking no, users don't give a fuck about network health if it saves them one cent.
People, please don't be fucking retards, allow developers to decide on fees, they kinda dig this shit much deeper than you do. They care about Bitcoin network, that's their job.

Bitcoin transations can have multiple inputs and outputs. In the simplest case, for an exchange transaction we have two inputs and two outputs:
    Input1: x colored BTC from A
    Input2: 1 BTC from B
    Output1: x colored BTC to B
    Output2: 1 BTC to A
A and B would create and sign this transaction together. There are certain rules which specify where the colored coin go, i.e. in this example Output1 is colored, while Output2 isn't.
So this transaction is included into a blockchain just as a normal Bitcoin transaction.
In a more general case multiple inputs and multiple outputs are used, but rules make transfer unambiguous.


There is a chain of transactions goes up from the genesis transaction, where all colored coin transfers are valid according to the rules.
Particularly, WebcoinX does a recursive scan, going backwards through a transaction history, to find color of UTXO it got and make sure that it is correct.

If you believe that PT shareholders somehow benefit from TAT collecting 5% fee you're incredibly naive and financially illiterate.

Game isn't symmetric if different parties have different utility functions or discounting.
We cannot formalize a process of "fighting", but if we illustrate this through a simple game:
1. Scammer offers buyer a choice: either he gets full sum in a week, or x percent of sum right now.
2. Now buyer can evaluate these two choices taking into account his utility function and discounting into account.
3. (Of course, scammer offers choice according to his own utility function.)
If buyer is actually interested in buying goods, getting money sooner means more utility to him despite the monetary loss, so he is likely to agree to it.

AGAIN, it is a plan which they might follow if they are good guys.
But if they are bad guys they will simply wait.
So this plan means absolutely nothing. There is no way to tell how much of hashing power they currently have. They might pretend they have 40% when they in fact have 60%.
Or one operator will control two seemingly independent pools. One will have 40%, another will have 20%.
Moreover, if you have just 40% of hashing power, you can get to 50+% if you DDoS your competitors.
Yes, I know pools are frequently DDoSed, but if you have profit motivations you can DDoS much harder.
Satoshi did not envision mining pools, he thought attacker can get at most 10% of hashing power.  When it is 40% network is no longer secure.
The fact that BTC Guild's plan starts at 40% shows that they are incompetent greedy fucks who do not care about security and simply want to make it look like they are good guys.

On the other hand, people like Peter Schiff predicted hyperinflation and other nasty stuff, which didn't happen. We just had an ordinary depression, with deflation, stock market crash etc. As expected. In the end people who were predicting doomsday-like scenarios were very wrong and they lost way more than normal investors.

I've read it multiple times. It cannot work for a number of reasons:
1. It requires non-standard script. Non-standard scripts are currently not allowed by standard Bitcoin nodes.
2. It requires transaction update semantics which is currently disabled in standard node implementation.
3. ~~Finally, cross-chain trade is not secure, it is vulnerable to race conditions.~~ (Um, thinking more about this, probably that's not the case.)
Tx2 is a transaction which sends coins back in case other party cancels transactions. It has nLockTime in future, e.g. it can be executed 100 blocks later.
"A" can try to spend coins using secret near the deadline. In that case it is possible that "A" will get his coins back and also get "B" coins in B's chain if B won't be able to create his spending transaction in a timely manner.
In other words, it isn't atomic.
I've discussed this with Mike Hearn, and I think we came to conclusion that atomic coin swapping is truly superior.
In any case, you're an asshole and you're wasting my time.

You can use 10000 satoshi per unit of your currency, say, IOU worth 1 USD. 
 * This means that amount less than 55 cents cannot be sent. 
 * Also there is a problem if there is less than 55 cents left in your wallet.
 * Issuing 1 dollar costs you 1 cent worth of Bitcoins. To issue $10000 USD worth of IOUs you need 1 Bitcoin = $100.

No, that's not how it works.
If a mining pool with 5% hashrate adopts replace-by-fee policy, that means that double-spend will be successful in ~5% of cases. This is actually OK: 1/20 of meals you buy will be free.
So, basically, if you buy a meal each day, one day each month meal will be free.
In other words, it's like a lottery one can participate in.


Well, after next block reward drop fees will be a significant part of miners' income. And they will try to maximize fees. Replace-by-fee means higher fees, so this is the policy a rational miner will adopt.

Namecoin is vulnerable to this kind of attacks because it is based on same kind of blockchain as Bitcoin: validation is done my miners, it is crucial to keep blockchain consistent.
Mastercoin uses a different approach: validation is done by clients, blockchain doesn't need to be consistent.
This means that it isn't necessary to choose the longest chain: all referenced blocks are valid. And thus it is immune to the kind of attack you've described.
Sabotage will simply increase confirmation times, but as long as somebody does it properly, transactions will be eventually confirmed.

So you reveal your Bitcoin address only to one node...

Well, currently I cannot buy groceries with Bitcoin. I need either cash or payment card to do that.
Thus I need to transfer money from exchange to my card or wallet.
So Bitcoin will provide cheap transfers ONLY when it can be used for payments directly. That's important function, not implementing WU on top of Bitcoin.
Also I think you don't get what WU does.
If I have money in my bank account, I can transfer it within country either without any fee, or for a very low fee.
So WU is, basically, for people who do not have bank accounts, it is for people who have cash and want to transfer cash, especially across borders. Their fees are high because they need to maintain hundreds of thousands locations all around the world. Having agents on ground is necessary to be able to do convenient cash-&gt;cash transfers, but it costs a lot.
So WU's business is to provide convenience to people who do not have access to other payment options.
If you would start cash-&gt;cash transfer business which would use Bitcoin, you won't be able to escape from high costs of having agents on the ground. And if it is not cash-&gt;cash, it isn't like WU at all, it only works with help of other payment systems

This can work, but there are several problems with it.
Suppose somebody  issues USD coins in such a way that $1 USDcoin = 10000 satoshi. Now USDcoin has a "metal value" of 0.0001*100 = $0.01 USD if BTC/USD is 100.
There are two options:
1. Principal and metal value are accounted separately, i.e. to buy 10 USDcoins you need to pay whatever they are worth + 100000 satoshi.
2. Price of colored coin is fixed in the currency it is denominated in, which means that issuer gets some Bitcoin exposure.
In the first case you'll have to deal with weird prices (or 1% inaccuracy). In second case issuer gets Bitcoin exposure equal to 1% of nominal value, which might be a problem if issuers profits are thin.
Another problem is with change. Sure, we can say people to never send less than $1 USDcoin.
But suppose somebody has $10 USDcoins in his wallet and needs to pay $9.50 USD. But $0.50 USDcoins is 5000 satoshi, which is less than minimum. So we have to explain user than in this case payment will be rounded up to $10 USD.
To summarize, it is still possible to implement colored coins with straightforward value accounting, but there are several annoying things.
Perhaps the biggest issue is that people now recommend alternative coloring schemes (which are order of magnitude more complex) so we cannot simply settle on something.

It isn't that hard to make it work for thin clients: you can just make a search tree and reference it from blocks. It isn't hard, I bet a sophomore CS student can do it as a year project.
The only reason it wasn't implemented like that is that namecoin is a quick hack on top of Bitcoin.


Well, the thing is, Namecoin can offer same kind of functionality as DNSSEC/SSL. But only if there is no middleman.
If there is a middleman, there is absolutely no reason to use Namecoin, you can just use a centralized database.
Namecoin is nice as a proof-of-concept, but it needs an implementation which works for end users.

Shorting increases risk for participating parties.
Suppose somebody short-sells bitcoins, but exchange rate goes up. He now needs to buy them back at higher price. What if they don't have enough money?
It means there is a counter-party risk either for exchange, or for people who lend bitcoins.
Another nasty scenario is short-squeeze situation where rising price forces short position liquidation, which pushes price even higher, which causes more liquidations and so on.
Shit like this actually happened on icbit.se, although it was just one person who tried to manipulate the market, but in the end exchange had to pay for his experiments.
So it's better to keep MtGox a straight spot market without shorts, or stop-loss for that matter.
These features increase incentives to manipulate the market. If you know that there are many people with stop-loss orders, you wait until liquidity is minimal and dump a lot of bitcoins to bring price below stop-loss. This triggers chain-reaction: stop-loss sell-off pushes price down, which starts another stop-loss. After it burned down you can buy your bitcoins back.

This, people, is why we need fully decentralized services.
It isn't even hard to implement it... Just running something on Tor, is, of course, easier, and so people focus on low-hanging fruits.
EDIT: OK, here's a sketch of possible implementation. (As people do not believe me that it is easy.)
First, we assume that Tor can hide user's IP, BitMessage allows encrypted communication between peers, and Namecoin can be used to associate name with public key, and also to discover services. These things already exist, and they aren't exactly rocket science.
So what is left is reputation/feedback system and escrow.
First of all, we can mention retep's [fidelity bond idea]( it is possible to buy a reputation token by provably throwing away Bitcoins: this creates some barrier for entry for merchants.
Then, generally, purchase can go through following process:
1. Buyer finds merchant by scanning Namecoin chain for merchants who sell goods he wants. (E.g. "John's  is name of a merchant who sells alpaca socks.) His client will display reputation and feedback for each merchant. (See below.)
2. He communicates with merchant via BitMessage or something similar.
3. When they come to an agreement, merchant creates an invoice message, which is included into Bitcoin-like blockchain. (See below.)
4. Buyer then sends payment associate with this invoice.
5. Later he can also submit feedback message. (Other clients will later discover and display this feedback, but they will ignore feedback which doesn't come from legit customers.)
OK, so how does it work?
1. [Bitcoin protocol allows one to include an arbitrary message with his transaction.]( This feature is currently disabled on most Bitcoin nodes, but it can be re-enabled if necessary, or we can create an alt-coin which allows this.
2. So it is possible to include 'invoice' message into blockchain. Then it is possible to include a payment message which both sends some Bitcoins to merchant and also references invoice. Then it is possible to include 'feedback' message which also references invoice.
3. Now any client can parse blockchain, see invoice which comes from a certain merchant, payment which goes according to rules, and thus he can identify feedback as being valid. (I.e. feedback comes from a legit customer, not from some asshole.)
I would personally use colored coins for invoice/payment/feedback association: merchant creates two kinds of colored coins for himself; sends one invoice-coin and one feedback-coin to customer; customer sends him back invoice-coin when he sends payment, and sends him back feedback-coin when he sends feedback. 
But, perhaps, somebody can offer more elegant solution; say, these things can go to side-chain.
Now as for escrow, it can be done via 2-of-3 multisig script, then same invoice/payment/feedback system can be used again.

I'm just saying that translation of informal sentence in English into a logic expression is rather non-trivial. You have to deal with complex grammar and semantic ambiguities. Quite often result is ambiguous too and you need to find correct one from context.
(As for my understanding of logic, I had an university course which covered Boolean algebra. Also pretty much any calculus theorem has a decent amount of logic. Also I work as programmer and I have to deal with stuff like De Morgan laws pretty much on day to day basis.)
Let's go back to


(To make it clear, it isn't my bet, I just found it on forum.)
I would translate it into a first-order logic formula like this:
    for all x in [Avalon, ButterflyLabs, Deepbit Reclaimer, bASIC]:
        NOT(will_deliver_an_ASIC_bitcoin_miner(x))
So 'or' was just another kind of comma, it wasn't related to operator 'or'.
If you would try to write it in such a way that 'or' appears as an operator, you'll have to change structure  of sentence. And in that case I would argue that such re-structuring wasn't legitimate: logic error appeared during your modification and did not exist in original sentence.
Thus it becomes obvious that your criticism is based on superficial understanding: yes, perhaps it could have been worded better; but De Morgan law isn't really relevant. You just saw "or" and "NOT" and thought that it was wrong, but you haven't actually tried to parse the grammar and translate sentence into a logic formula. Judging something without even parsing it makes your judgement superficial.

If there is something wrong with Bitcoin, government will go after BitPay, it won't go after all companies which accept Bitcoin via BitPay.
For example, suppose PayPal does something shoddy. (Well, it does, definitely.) Does that mean that anybody who accepts payments via PayPal can be held liable of whatever problem there might be with PayPal?

I once tried to formalize this and it didn't work so well...
Humans do not really optimize maximum expected utility, they optimize _an estimate_ of maximum expected utility, and that estimate is very crude and flawed. I'm now inclined to think that attraction to lotteries is only due to that flawed estimate.
For example, it appears that you assume that utility is non-additive and path-dependent, but it makes a really weird and likely inconsistent model.

If I understand correctly, vanity addresses are required so that one merchant who is already authenticated won't be able to pretend he is another merchant.
I don't think it will work. Suppose you registered 1lemming&lt;something&gt; and user added it to database.
Then I try it with 1leming&lt;something&gt;, or perhaps 1lemming&lt;something different&gt;.
User will see a confirmation dialog again  dialog again, it should warn him, but do you think he actually remembers what merchants he have already used? Users often have more than one device and they can forget what they confirmed on which device. They also might think that it's OK: perhaps program asks for confirmation periodically, or when something have changed.
Then two 1lemming addresses are in database, and the only thing which pretects identity is "memorable unique image", but I don't think it can work as users do not pay attention to such images.
Client software might give a warning if there is two addresses have _similar_ prefix. It is much better, but is still far from perfect: it works only if 1) user has only one wallet; 2) user does some kind of out-of-band confirmation of address, e.g. checks on WoT.
So I believe in the end short mnemonic IDs are simply better: it's easier to remember words than it is to remember image _if one does not pay attention_.

Quite likely.
If you're in USA, [JOBS act]( provides exemptions, but they only cover


But perhaps someone will provide a legal shield for issuers (i.e. act as "funding portal" for colored coins).
I know people who are optimistic about this, i.e. they want to find solutions which would allow people to sell shares of their small companies without having problems with law.
(Also I know a small bakery / coffee shop in Mexico which listed its shared on LitecoinGlobal.com, so I guess some people do not care about legality that much.)


From a technical perspective, you need to create an asset definition. Colored coin client will help you: it will have a form of some sort, you fill details like name, terms of contract, etc. Then click a button: and it creates an asset definition. It also needs some small amount of Bitcoins to create colored coins.
Then you need to send this asset definition to interested parties (possibly, publishing it on your web site).
Then you just put coins you got on sale via client, and investors buy them.
From non-technical perspective, more steps might be needed: perhaps, contract needs to be prepared in some format, signed with your GPG keys. Perhaps you will need to work with a rating agency of some sort which will oversee the process to make sure that your offer is legitimate, and in the end it will put its signature on this asset definition.
Colored coins decouple trading platform from validation process. Currently centralized platforms have their own validation process, so we don't see a lot of competition in this area. But if people will start using colored coins for IPOs, they will be able to various rating agencies to vouch for them, and I believe in the end we will end up with process which has good results in terms of filtering out scams, but won't be too cumbersome for small issuers.




Well, I believe there will be sites which will list offers. But it's also possible to do it yourself: publish asset definition on your own site.


Well, I don't know. But we can see that on existing Bitcoin stock exchanges most companies follow their contracts and pay dividends. Few of them default / turn out to be scammers.
In some cases it is about reputation, in other cases people just want to be honest.


Selling bonds to public is also illegal with proper registration, but I think it is easier to make a workaround in case with bonds.
And in case with shares, if our desire is to discourage scams, we can make a contract which will allow to convert shares to bonds under certain conditions. I.e. when company doesn't follow contract (stopped paying dividends, for example), somebody might buy majority of shares and demand payback of debt in courts.


Why do you think so? Shareholders can prove that they own shares using colored coins they own, that's pretty much the whole point.

Actually people already tried this in practice... If interblock interval is small, you're at very big disadvantage if you aren't a member of biggest mining pool.
 Basically, biggest pool has lowest orphan rate because it starts working on next block immediately.
Thus small interblock interval leads to a centralization of mining power. In practice, they usually have "The Pool".
I'm not sure that 60s is enough to prevent centralization, at that point pressure to use biggest pool is already big enough.

Here's what I would recommend:
1. Burn an image of a Linux LiveCD of your choice onto CD.
2. Boot from it. No, VM doesn't work, because in theory the host machine can steal any information within VM. In practice, it can easily record keyboard input, make screenshots, intercept network communications and files. So running something in VM doesn't make things more secure.
3. Install Electrum.
4. When you run it for the first time, it creates a wallet and shows you seed. Write it down on a piece of paper.
5. Write down addresses from this wallet.
If you're paranoid, you can do extra steps:
1. Make sure that you get genuine copy of Linux distro: verify it using checksums, signatures, etc.
2. Make sure that you get genuine copy of Electrum: again, checksums, etc.
3. Disable communications after you have installed Electrum.
4  Encrypt seed and write down encrypted seed.
5. Make sure that computer you use is secure: has no spying devices attached to it, no BIOS modifications etc.

The problem with your reasoning is that you do not take into account that strategic/long-term investors need to consider the expected value in future rather than the current situation.
E.g. suppose you estimate that Bitcoin "market cap" will be higher than $1 trillion in 2 years with probability of 0.2.
In that case one should buy as many bitcoins as his risk preferences allow as long as price is below $13000.
Current adoption rate can affect estimates, but only to a small degree. Can you make any conclusions about climate if you look out of your window and see that it currently rains?

You either didn't do the math or don't know how it works.
You need to mine 2016 blocks at the current difficulty to drop it by factor of 4. Then 2016 more blocks to drop it to 6.25% of original difficulty. Then 2016 more blocks to drop it to 1.5%.
So if attacker has 1.5% of overall hashpower, he needs to mine 6048 blocks to be able to produce 1 block in 10 minutes like normal network can.
This is equivalent to 2016 + 2016/4 + 2016/16 = 2646 block on the normal chain (if we assume constant difficulty).
That corresponds to 66150 BTC in opportunity cost.
Now, if difficulty have increased since the last checkpoint (and you're attacking a new node), opportunity cost is lower, but in realistic scenarios it is still pretty significant.

You got it wrong, it isn't really about tech-savvy/non-tech-savvy, it is about risks.
The problem I see is that some people (like in the article I mentioned) try to paint Bitcoin so nice and user-friendly, when in reality it isn't.
E.g. Core developers like Mike Hearn and Gavin Anderson agree that "Bitcoin addresses" are fundamentally shitty w.r.t. security, Bitcoin needs a secure payment protocol.
So I think people should be aware of risks.
I only mentioned distinction between tech-savvy and non-tech-savvy users just to avoid being accused of discouraging use of Bitcoin. I believe that both groups need to be aware of risks. But now people accuse me of elitism... Go figure.
The reality of it is that if you want to use non-negligible amount of Bitcoins, you need to spend some resources on security, and, obviously, tech-savvy users will find that easier to do as they don't need to seek external help.

Well, I can tell you it's simply not sustainable to flood blockchain with microtransactions, so off-chain transaction and payment aggregation are necessary.
Complexity of off-chain transaction depends on level of security you need. For small sums of money it is pretty much trivial to implement it, just use inputs.io or something like that. Maybe just do aggregation in your own db.
It is hard to do it only if it requires high-security, i.e. inability of operator to steal the money.

Well, Winklevoss twins mentioned that they own like 100,000 Bitcoins. So, yes, there are people who invest large mounts of money into Bitcoin.
Amount of risk one wants to take is highly subjective, neither high risk nor low risk is inherently 'smart'.
On the other hand, as potential reward is rather high, it isn't really necessary to invest a lot into Bitcoin to get a nice reward.
General advice here is to invest how much you aren't afraid to lose.
Say, losing $1000 kinda sucks, but it's unlikely that it will have a significant impact on your life.


I understand why it might look like that, but it isn't really a charity, you just buy your share of Bitcoins in case it will be a big thing... That quite makes sense.
JFYI if we divide 21000000 bitcoins equally between all people on Earth (7 billion), each one will get 0.003 BTC.
Or you might want to consider wealthiest 100M people on Earth, if they will divide Bitcoins equally they would get 0.21 BTC per person.
This gives you a hint that even small amount of Bitcoin isn't meaningless, it just happens so that now you can buy it for cheap. 
Back in 2009 you could buy 1000 BTC for $1, but now it is a fairly large amount of money.
So even if you invest less than $100, it doesn't mean it isn't a serious investment.

"Off-blockchain transaction" is a fancy word for keeping transaction internally in your own database.
E.g. somebody would fill their BitMonet account for 0.1 BTC and then use it to pay 0.01 BTC to 10 different pages. You simply aggregate payments and do a settlement once a week or so.
With bitcoinj you can update payment value in non-final transaction. E.g. user will create non-final transaction for 0.1 BTC, most of which goes back to user. Later as user reads articles via BitMonet he re-signs new non-final replacement transaction which pay to BitMonet, e.g. after two 0.01 BTC articles it is 0.02 BTC to BitMonet and 0.08 BTC back to user. Eventually a final transaction is signed.
So it is basically same thing with internal database as before + very complex machinery to re-sign transactions.  It only makes sense to do it if user doesn't trust 0.1 BTC to your service, but it's pretty much absurd.
Note that it would require completely customized client and server, tightly integrated with user interface. In other words, it is hard to implement and not worth it.

You need to keep only a small fraction of your money in shared wallet.
E.g. you could keep bulk of your savings in your private wallet, encrypted and protected. And small amount of pocket money in a shared account.


Bitcoin is just a protocol, it's up to people to decide how to use it.
Apparently it is great for secure store of value, large scale transactions etc. But sucks for microtransactions.
So the solution is to use a protocol _on top of Bitcoin_ to accommodate this use.
Bitcoin will still be used for settlements. So it doesn't mean we are abandoning Bitcoin, just building on top of it. In fact only Bitcoins allows us to perform such settlements with minimum overhead and without legal mumbo-jumbo.
You know, like HTTP protocol allows people to upload files directly via PUT requests, but people often prefer to edit blog posts and what not in in-browser editor. Such editor might be not as convenient as your local word processor and not as flexible as raw HTML, but for majority of people it is good enough, and so it is widely popular.

I gave you a link which describes how it works
Transaction output has scriptPubKey which (usually) has a hash of public key.
Then transaction input's scriptSig has public key and signature.
When Bitcoin software checks transaction input signature, it runs scriptPubKey script, which first checks whether public key hash matches, then check whether supplied signature is valid **against  public key supplied in this input's scriptSig**.
So attacker will simply supply **his** public key in scriptSig, and then transaction signature will be valid.

OK, I'll try to explain, although it is, probably, pointless...
It really matters who's purchasing power is increasing.
If everybody had same amount of money, and purchasing power of that currency would increase, people would be able to spend more, so you can expect increase in economic growth. (Although not proportional to increase in purchasing power.)
However, in reality different people have different amount of money. Poor people have almost zero savings, they spend almost everything they earn. While rich people have lots of savings, but they are not in a hurry to spend them, because they already have everything they want.
Usually there are more poor people than there are rich, and thus overall economic activity significantly depends on behavior of the poor.
So, well, purchasing power of Bitcoin is increasing, does that mean that poor people can spend more? No, unlikely so. Poor people have negligible amount of Bitcoins, so they won't be able to spend more. Do you think that employers will keep their wages the same? That's unlikely: if economy is in the bad shape, there is a lot of unemployment, so employer will be able to sack existing employees and hire them (or others) back for lower wages.
Wealth of rich people will increase even further, but they do not generate that much economic activity, their contribution will be small.
So economic growth will be affected by whatever other effects are there.
In real world (not hypothetical Bitcoin anti-utopia) lower exchange rate (cheaper local currency) stimulates economic activity, because labor becomes cheaper, thus cost of locally produced goods is lower, so it becomes more profitable to produce and export them.
It is very well known and well understood phenomenon, not some bullshit theory.

Have you ever heard about p2pool? It was supposed to be a perfect solution which minimizes variance while still providing pretty much complete decentralization. When it was released I thought it is the end for centralized pools.
But no, centralized pools offer somewhat better conditions and miners prefer them...


The thing is, I understand the point of Bitcoin mining. Do you? It is not for you to take profit. 
The point of mining is to make Bitcoin decentralized, that's how Satoshi have envisioned it.

Central bank creates new money to buy bonds. Colloquially it is known as "printing money". Of course, they don't print physical money, but it has same effect on monetary base.


Ehm, QE is used to prop up the economy when interest rates are close to zero. I don't think that decreasing cost of borrowing for government is the stated goal.


Don't forget about foreign investors, foreign banks, including central banks... Japanese yen is a popular currency for carry trade since it is possible to borrow it at very low interest rate and invest elsewhere. So it is moved  in huge quantities between institutions, and there is a lot of speculation volume.
I have no idea who will suffer from yen inflation, but it is definitely not as simple as "the Japanese are saving in yen". Maybe they do, but deficit is not an evidence of that.
When yen is used as a reserve currency (it is), foreign central banks will suffer the consequences.

This is why I'm not going to invest a lot into ASICMINER shares, they are risky.  In the short term it's unlikely that they'll face a lot of competition, so it is more-or-less safe. But I'm prepared to dump them as soon as share price peaks or there are bad news.

Well, it is possible that without a fee your transaction won't ever be included into a block, as there is NO incentive for a miner to include it.
Basically, free transactions are like a free promo. It won't last.
Don't be an asshole and add at least 0.0001 BTC fee to your transactions. This is how it is supposed to work: miners should be encouraged to include transactions.

Open Transactions is usable right now, but it isn't decentralized.
The lead developer of Open Transactions said that the plan is to rely on colored coins for decentralization.
You can see ~~here~~ (see below) that they have colored coins integration task. These tasks were created by Chris (FellowTraveler) himself.
If you don't really need decentralization (which means that you have to trust your Bitcoins to server operator like you trust them to btct.co site), Open Transaction is probably as good as it gets. (I've heard the client they have now sucks from ui perspective (too complex), but is otherwise usable.)
With colored coins you only need to rely on issuer, no 3rd party needs to be involved, no need to keep Bitcoins in an online wallet.
EDIT: Shitty website doesn't allow me to post links. You get there through:

2. In the menu on the left, "Review open projects"

You don't. You do not need to have 100% probability of success: if one half of your purchases are 'free' it is already good.


Well, race attacks are largely for small-scale purchases where you have no hashrate at all.
But if [replace-by-fee]( passes, there will be a way to increase chances of getting your transaction into the next block. But note that you pay only if double-spend is successful, so it always has positive effect.

BitTorrent and BitCoin are very different.
BitTorrent is decentralized to much larger extent: most swarms are completely unrelated. This means that killing one swarm has no effect on other swarm.

Yes, but if developers would insert something malicious into code, chances are that others will discover it. 


No, you don't need to trust any nodes... That's the whole point.


It is not blind at all! We are using open source software. Each change is recorded and reviews by multiple developers.
It would be very hard to sneak in some malicious code, basically that would require collusion between pretty much all developers, which is unrealistic.
Importantly, it might take weeks until code will be used, and it gives you a plenty of time for review... But in case with mining, you'll face consequences in real time, before you review them.
So this is very different.
@_date: 2013-09-09 10:12:05
Good point.
In most cases "off-chain transactions" means that "your" Bitcoins are actually held by some centralized entity. 
Which is not very different from what e-gold and LibertyReserve did with gold and USD, respectively. You know how it ended. (The only difference is that you can send a transaction from this off-chain service to normal Bitcoin address. So it is easier to escape from it than from e-gold or LR.)
However, it isn't the only possible way to implement off-chain transactions!
For example:
 * Gavin Andersen [described]( how to do it with multi-signature scripts and private key transfers
 * Another possible way to do this is non-final transactions: transaction can be marked as non-final and changed as many times as needed. Then at some point transaction becomes final and goes into blockchain.
 * Finally, just use funds locked in multi-sig script as a collateral for transactions.
In all these cases central entity cannot steal funds. It has some degree of control, but usually there is an escape route in case central entity fails.
I say, we should call "off-chain transactions" services of the first kind in some other way.
Say, MyBitcoin.com was doing pretty much exactly the same thing as inputs.io is doing, but it was called e-wallet (or something like that). It looks like `inputs.io` claims that it is 'off-chain transactions' service to get more legitimacy. But in reality it is a step back from blockchain.info wallet.

Thin client is unable to perform validation on its own, it has to use centralized servers to perform validation.
This is a fundamental limitation of the protocol.  J. R. Willett decided that keeping protocol simple is more important that, well, all other considerations.
Trustless thin client _might_ be possible through use of advanced cryptography (non-interactive proofs), otherwise it is "let's query these servers and hope they aren't lying", i.e. for thin clients it is no better than a centralized solution.
Another problem is that Mastercoin is more vulnerable to synchronization problems than Bitcoin, as it doesn't use same approach.
Bitcoin network actively avoids double-spends, so it is relatively safe to wait only 1-2 confirmations, or even no confirmations at all. 
But Mastercoin doesn't rely on this protection mechanisms, so confirmations are required, and for a certain number of confirmations it is significanty easier to pull-off a Mastercoin double-spend than Bitcoin double-spend.
@_date: 2013-09-16 14:49:12


Was it analyzed by retards like you?
You're missing the very basic thing: as Satoshi himself have noted, proof-of-work provides [Byzantine fault tolerance](


However, if one node (i.e. mining pool's server) controls the majority of hashing power, if it experiences Byzantine failure, whole network might become faulty (i.e. go into a forked state where double-spending is possible).
This is absolutely unacceptable, network health MUST NOT depend on health of a single node, but it is what happens in case with centralized pooled mining.
Please note that it doesn't matter what exactly causes this Byzantine failure, it might be:
1. server operator going rogue (possibly he just wants to watch the Bitcoin burn)
2. software or hardware problem at server (e.g. a custom Bitcoin node version which produces a fork under certain conditions)
3. server being hijacking by malicious actors, like a) competitors; b) people who want to make money on financial bets; c) government; d) for shits and giggles
4. network-level attack which allows attacker to manipulate what data server receives
You assume one particular kind of attack and conclude that "it's a pretty sure thing that nobody will bother", but in reality pretty much anything is possible...
Instead of trying to analyze motivation of potential attackers we should instead make sure that Bitcoin network stays Byzantine fault tolerant under rather broad assumptions, and one way to do this is to make sure that share of each pool is relatively small, so that Byzantine failure of that pool won't affect the network.

If mediator sides with buyer but seller has evidence that he is right, mediator will likely be out of business. Think about incentives
Also if seller doesn't trust mediators he will offer user using mediatorless setup (2-of-2). There is NO incentive for a seller to cheat in such case as he will get no money. And if he uses extortion (50%/50% split, no goods delivered), buyer can then use it to drive him out of business.

Well, ideally you should run Electrum from LiveCD with detached media. 
Then it physically won't be able to store or send any information.
The procedure you described above won't help if your Windows computer is compromised: spyware program might save screenshots and send them when you connect to internet.
Also Electrum might, in theory, hijack Windows and install a thingie which would send private key to attacker once you connect.
If you run it off LiveCD with HDD detached, it can only save data into BIOS, and that's sort of unlikely. (Also, in theory your BIOS can be compromised...) So that's what I call "very safe".
It's never "very safe" to run something which you need to trust on your regular Windows machine because you can never know that Windows (or, well, any other OS) isn't compromised.
It might sound paranoid, but it really isn't. I witnessed sys admins who had exactly this screenshot-taking spyware installed on their most guarded computers, and they thought they are tech savvy and it won't happen to them.

You can lose your money whenever you open blockchain.info wallet:
 * if there is spyware installed on your computer
 * if blockchain.info will send you malicious JS which steals wallet (in theory there is a browser extension which could check it)
 * if there is a vulnerability in browser.
If you want long-term storage for coins which is really secure, check brain wallets/paper wallets.
Basically, the idea  is to generate private key in an environment which is reallly safe. For example, boot off Linux LiveCD, run wallet generation program. Print or write down private key or password. Reboot.
Now private key exists only on piece of paper, or in your head.

OK, I'll explain. Currently a default minimal fee is 10000 satoshi (=0.00010000 BTC) per kilobyte. To spend 1 transaction output you need something like 200 bytes, so transaction outputs less than 2000 satoshi (= 0.00002000 BTC) no sense since you pay more in fees than they are worth.
So, first of all, you need to explain this to people who run affiliate programs: when they pay less than 0.00002 BTC they actually send a negative amount of money. They should stop doing that, it makes no sense. (FYI 0.00002 BTC is $0.0026, i.e. one quarter of a USD cent.)
Now let's go back to your situation. 
 * You need a client which lets you to select per-kilobyte fee.
 * It should understand that spending outputs which are less than 2000 satoshi makes no sense.
 * You might need to break it into several transaction, I vaguely remember there is a "huge-ass transaction" surcharge, so maybe you need to break it into several transactions.
In the end if my calculations are right total fee should not exceed 0.0035 BTC if you use 0.0001 BTC/KiB min fee.

0-confirmation double-spend can be 100% free, as long as you do not need high success rate.
E.g. suppose there is 5% chance of a successful double-spend. In 95% of cases you have to pay for a product, but in 5% you get it approximately for free. Isn't it nice?
Even 1-confirmation double-spend can be free, but is rare: you need a situation where there is a race between two pool and one of blocks is orphaned. But it happens, here's a list of orphaned blocks: 
As you can see there were two orphans today, so there was an opportunity to pull off a 1-confirmation double-spend.

Yes. It would be weird if two cryptocurrencies with nearly identical features with similar (up to the order of magnitude) market share.
It is as weird as having two different credit card companies each maintaining its own network. Like, VISA and Mastercard. Why do we need two? is it beneficial to merchants?
I think it was mentioned many times that many attacks against Bitcoin won't affect Litecoin, and vice versa. There is a counter-measure  to each attack, so we need some temporary back-up plan.
As for the markets, I think there is an interesting effect: 
Let's start with the fact that that there are individual/companies which own LOTS of Bitcoins. On the 100,000 BTC scale. What happens if they dump it on market? 
(Why would they do that? Many possible reasons: bitcoins can be stolen/act of terrorism/mental illness/"some men just want to watch the world burn".)
This can crash the market. At least, temporarily.
Now, suppose both Bitcoin and Litecoin has large market share. Will a dump like this crash both markets? How would they react?
Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies give disproportional influence to early adopters: some cretin could mine bitcoins on his gaming PC in early days, and now he is one of wealthiest men on Earth. It's like a random fluctuation amplified by a low difficulty at start. Is it good? Probably now. It is better when market participants are rational, but we can't assume that a random person who mined some bitcoins just because it sounded kinda cool is rational: There are many stories about people who mined thousands of bitcoins but lost them when they "re-formatted" hard drives.
Competition between 'copycat' cryptocurrencies can smooth this out, reducing importance of early adopters. Of course, early adopters won't like it, seeing it as a war.

In Bitcoin each payment you receive exists as an independent "coin" (unspent transaction output), and you can spend each such "coin" independently. This means that payments you receive are not linked (unless you use same address, LOL), so you have much better privacy.
Bitcoin is simply not optimized for space efficiency, it is optimized for anonymity. And normally you will generate a fresh address for each payment. (Basically, an address is like an invoice.)
It is possible to make a cryptocurrency which will have a notion of account, it will be more space-efficient, but it will be worse w.r.t. anonymity. Also it might be worse w.r.t. security.
Ripple is account-based, but Ripple's security is based on consensus among semi-trusted parties. 
OTOH nobody knows who Bitcoin miners are, they can be outright malicious, but system is resilient against any kind of interference because it is based on a very powerful principles: coin transfer is done using digital signature and such chains of transfer can be independently verified. Miners just do timestamping to prevent double-spend problem, they cannot alter transactions in any way. Even if there is a collusion among 99.9% of miners, it is relatively harmless.
However, in account-based system history is not preserved, so a collusion of "miners" can alter balances any way: there is no way to verify whether data they provide is correct.

I don't think that having no alternative/backup plan is healthy.
We know that Bitcoin is not perfect, for example, there was a fork due to unexpected software behavior in May. 
Sure, it lasted only for a few hours, so it wasn't a big deal... But it would be a bigger deal if everybody relied on Bitcoin.
Another reason to have an alternative is competition. If Bitcoin is the only currency, devs will be reluctant to add new features. Like, it works as it is, why bother?
However, suppose Litecoin exists too, and it has some extra features. Once those extra features will be tested in Litecoin, devs will feel the pressure to add them to Bitcoin too.
This doesn't work if alt-chains are just toys: we cannot test how features behave in real-world conditions on toys, and toys do not add an incentive to add features to Bitcoin mainline.
So healthy competition and back-up plan exist only if people actually use alt-coins and they have value.

Here's a list of Bitcoin financial companies: 
MPex/MPOE offer BTC/USD options.
Forex companies might offer leveraged (margin) trading via BTC CFDs.
For some reason Bitfinex isn't mentioned on wiki page, it offers leveraged trading. 
Difference between margin trading and futures is what price you use: current spot or futures. Spot might be more convenient, but there might be a difference in how spread, fees and settlement is organized. Particularly, you aren't paying interest when you're trading futures.
Basically, to buy $8000 worth of Bitcoins on Bitfinex you need to borrow $8000 USD, and currently interest they charge is 261.0% a year for dollars. That's because a lot of people want to buy bitcoins, obviously. So in the end it is same kind of a problem as with futures price being above spot price.

Well, in theory, in your wallet. In practice, you can't create them with Bitcoin-Qt anyway...
So you can just store a custom-made tx in a text file, and send it via API when it locks. It is up to you to submit this transaction.
(Of course, client which would fully support advanced features will keep such transactions in wallet and submit as needed.)
In Satoshi's orignal design it was stored in mempool... But it turned out that it creates problems for people who accept zero-conf transactions, so now client simply ignores transactions until they are final.
Original design was supposed to work together with transaction replacement semantics, so you can submit non-final transaction to mempool and then replace it with a final one (which pays to a different address, perhaps). But since mempool isn't synchronized via proof-of-work, it was more like an anti-feature: it makes it harder for legit users to do anything because tx replacement rules are too strict, and at the same time offers approximately zero protection. So it is good that it was removed.

Cash is regularly stolen. We even have a word for it: pickpocketing, burglary.

Same is true for Bitcoins.

Association between asset and color is in an 'asset definition' document which is outside of the blockchain.
E.g. if you're interesting in trading gold you'll need to find a reputable issuer and use an asset definition he provides. 
It doesn't need to be in the blockchain, and in fact asset definition in blockchain would be kinda useless: suppose you found one, how do you know it is from a reputable issuer?
Then, when asset is transferred, it is associated with an ordinary Bitcoin transaction output, so there is no need for extra info: you transfer the asset in the same way as you transfer bitcoins.

Green address is an address which is known to belong to a trusted party which we know won't double-spend. Payment needs to come from this green address, so this trusted party needs to be in control of user's funds. Which is called a "shared wallet".

Thinking more about this, lightweight registration checking is possible for namecoin too: one just needs to provide a "certificate" which links registration tx to the chain together with signature.

Both failsafe address and normal address are private keys, and I'd say it is reasonable to assume that if attacker can grab one, he can grab both. Or the whole chain.

He doesn't take into account that it is still possible to innovate within same blockchain+PoW model, and Bitcoin is much more reluctant to innovate than alt-chains.
A bug in Bitcoin might cost somebody millions of dollars, so devs are paranoid about adding features. They'd rather disable features than add them.
Bitcoin Script is a programming language, that's how Satoshi have envisioned it;  but it isn't used: only few fixed forms of script are allowed. It's, like, 99% of script features Satoshi have envisioned are disabled.
Recently non-final transactions got non-standard, they cannot get into mempools and cannot propagate. It is another disabled feature... (I personally think it is actually a good thing, though; but Satoshi saw it in a different way.)
It is true that currently no alt-chain offers a fundamental advantage over Bitcoin, but the thing is that they aren't so afraid to innovate. Let's take, for example, Sunny King: he changes PPCoin protocol however he wishes without even bothering to describe the changes.
So I think in the end Bitcoin will be like the Empire in Asimov's _Foundation_ series: too big to innovate, to inert to act. And thus alt-chains can win.
Of course, economist cannot know what features can be added to Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency. Even developers barely understand all the possibilities.
But it is very well possible that Bitcoin is eDonkey and some other cryptocurrency is BitTorrent.
It is hard to say why eDonkey lost... It had fully P2P search via Kad, which wasn't available for BitTorrent until recently. So in theory it was fully decentralized, fully open source... But still lost.
I believe that BitTorrent simply provided better features: better search via specialized sites, higher download speeds...
Well, eDonkey was much better for downloading obscure, long-tail stuff because it indexed all files offered for download. But it also was a problem: that long-tail stuff was always hanging in a queue, making current download slower.
So eDonkey was better for looking for something rare, while BitTorrent could download the latest moving much, much faster. (Also it was far more likely that you're downloading a movie you want, not some random porn.)
Guess which one won?
Of course majority of people use p2p downloads for latest movies and albums and do not care about rare stuff much...
Anyway, an economist cannot know all the internals of a technology

Here's what you originally wrote:


This is wrong. I simply corrected a mistake you've made, and you started spewing bullshit about IPs, NSA and the state in return...


There is a way to protect against it: accept zero-confirmation payments only from parties you trust.


This can be implement as a service: In advanced, user sends his money to a 2-of-2 multisig address where one pubkey is his and other pubkey belongs to a payment service merchant trusts. When user pays for hamburger, transaction is signed both by his wallet and by this trusted payment service.
Merchant knows that payment service won't allow double-spending (won't sign a transaction with same inputs twice), so there is no need to wait for confirmation.
We can assume that a special service is more trustworthy than a random user: quite likely, service won't be run anonymously (no need to trace IP addresses to get them); also, service has an incentive to keep being honest as it earns a tiny fee from each transaction going through it.
At the same time, service cannot steal user's funds as it isn't in control. And if for some reason service is shut down, funds can be released later by pre-signed nLocktime'd transaction (see here: 
Obviously, it isn't as decentralized as Bitcoin itself, but it is a good practical trade-off which is decentralized enough:
 * multiple such escrow services can exist, there is no barrier for entry
 * users can remain anonymous, service simply signs transactions without looking at who pays whom
 * very little amount of trust is required
What do I win?

This is utter bullshit: why something new can be potentially added to Bitcoin, it doesn't meant that it _will_ be added.
It is same reason why new business models are usually developed by startups rather than by big companies: incentive structure is different.
Startup founders know that they can fail, and they aren't afraid to experiment. Success means a big win.
However, people in large companies tend to avoid risks, and when they try something new they do it in half-assed way.
Same thing applies to cryptocurrencies. Say, Sunny King implemented proof-of-stake. It's unlikely that somebody would bother to implement something as complex like that just for a little experiment. (And Sunny King could profit from this by being an early adopter.) And you cannot test whether proof-of-stake works on testnet: you need to observe behavior of real people who believe that they work with something valuable.

It's mostly for people who need to use JSON-RPC API to accept payments or to do something advanced...
Otherwise, as a client is is fairly boring, and in many ways inferior.
However, in theory it is more robust and secure:
 * it doesn't need to rely on a handful of servers Electrum has to rely on
 * there is an attack against SPV-using clients: attacker can mine invalid block to forge an invalid transaction which will be accepted by an SPV client; this cannot happen to a full client
(But this attack is expensive, and attacker would have to make sure you connect to his server. And it is should only bother merchants, I think.)

If you want to buy shares of company Foo, you can download asset definition from its web site. This way you can be sure that it actually comes from this company, not from some impostor.
There is no need for a database of all contracts.
But I guess there will be web sites which will list contracts and asset definitions, they will roughly correspond to centralized exchanges we have now. Perhaps companies will pay to be listed (as it increases visibility) and for other services like validation (is it even a real company?), audit (are their reports correct?), ratings, etc. We can expect that investors will give preference to stock of companies which have proper reports, are audited, etc.
But this is completely out of scope of the colored coin protocol. On the protocol level, if several parties agree on genesis transaction of a certain color, they will be able to 'see' colored coins, send, trade them, etc. If they do not care about this color, it won't bother them in any way: they will simply see these coins as uncolored.

Hot wallet with 24h delay is inconvenient.


OK, so to make use of it, you're supposed to have a separate known-to-be-secure computer, which will be used daily to verify all transactions... verify against what?
How do you know whether they send coins to customers or to attacker? What if attacker hijacks legitimate withdraw transactions and changes address?
You can get withdrawal log from server, but server can be compromised.
Now, let's say, somehow you got a list of legitimate withdrawals, and you look it through on known-to-be-secure computer.
But can't you just get this list of withdrawals and sign a transaction on this known-to-be-secure computer?
As I mentioned, delay is basically security-through-obscurity: it protects you against inept attacker.
On the other hand, use of multi-signature actually makes things more secure... Say, when users deposit Bitcoin into you exchange, put their money into 2-of-2 multisig with your and user's key. Now if attacker grabs your key, he cannot get user's money.

Your theory is entirely wrong. If you talk about average time, we need to model process statistically.
And, statistically speaking, Bitcoin block mining is a [Poisson process]( So interval between two blocks has [exponential distribution](
Exponential distribution is memoryless. Waiting time is always 10 minutes, no matter how much time you have already waited and no matter when was the last block.
Sounds counter-intuitive?
Well, consider this example: suppose you're doing coin flips, you know that you have a fair coin, e.g. in 50% of cases you get heads. This time you have 5 tails in a row. Then next flip must be heads, right???
Wrong. Chances of getting heads on next flip is 50%. Coin is memoryless: it doesn't remember previous results.
Bitcoin mining is of a same nature as coin flipping: each time you compute a hash you get a chance to win a block. So it is memoryless too.
In practice, this means that waiting 20+ minutes between blocks isn't uncommon.
For example, as you can see [here]( it is even possible to have 4 blocks in two hours.

By the way, problems with Satoshi's Bitcoin client was the reason I dismissed Bitcoin initially...
I read about Bitcoin in August of 2010, read the paper and FAQ. I found concept interesting, but I thought that storing every transaction on every computer, obviously, doesn't scale, and so this experiment will fail.
But I gave it a benefit of doubt, and installed Bitcoin client (i.e. ancestor of Bitcoin-Qt). It stored block index in BDB and did fsync() after each block, I think, so even downloading empty blockchain took a lot of time.

You're obviously unaware of capital controls. They work on a country level, not on currency level.
Government sees all your transactions, it will ask for explanations if it sees something unusual.
Say, here in Ukraine whenever I receive a payment in foreign currency I have to give bank a copy of a contract which explains what it is for.
To open an account in a foreign bank I need to apply for a license, and then explain each transaction I make.
Note that this is completely orthogonal to Bitcoin: capital controls and related restrictions _already_ exist.

It is a distributed consensus. More confirmations you wait, more certain it gets. It never gets exactly 100%, but very close to that.
If we expect 1 block in 10 minutes on average, average waiting time is also 10 minutes ([Poisson process](
If you just wait until transaction is included into a block, risk of a double-spend is fairly significant because that block can be orphaned.
It is a norm to wait 6 confirmations for largish transactions, but it's pretty much an arbitrary number. We have mining pool with hashrate close to 50% now, so it might be more reasonable to wait 144 blocks. (If you transfer millions of dollars worth of Bitcoins.)
On the other end of the spectrum, if
 * you're selling something very cheap and do not care much about double-spends
 * you do not ship goods immediately
 * you know the person and can grab him by his balls if he double-spends
it isn't necessary to wait at all, and transaction can get to your client pretty much instantaneously.
So, basically, it is 0 to 144 confirmations depending on circumstances.


Of course, there is slim chance of having a isolated sub-graph of hosts in the internet. It may be created artificially and boosted with techniques like dns spoofing.
Well, you can try sending different versions of transactions to different nodes, it is fairly easy to pull off 0-confirmations double-spend this way. (I.e. node gets one version of transaction into its mempool, but another version gets into a block, in ~50% of cases.)
But 1-confirmation double-spend can happen only if block is orphaned, and it is relatively rare. 
You can find a list of orphaned blocks here: 
Deeper reorgs can happen only if miners (mining pools) happen to have very bad connectivity (which is unlikely), or in some extremely rare case where miners happen to mine blocks at exactly same time.
