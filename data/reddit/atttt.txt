I like what you said about spreading the word of bitcoin. I am new to both reddit and bitcoin and am currently out of a job, I found that having a digital currency allows me to save some capital better than holding cash. When I get back in the swing of things I'll definitely tip on other sub reddits.

Hello, new here, what does private tipping mean? You don't know if you're tipped? Thanks guys.

Do we celebrate when it goes back down past $420 too?

I still don't understand how people just comment something like "have a coffee on me" and that tips someone the amount for a coffee. Is that money really going through?

I saw what someone wrote below about a hotdog stand that accepts bitcoun payment. I seriously had that same idea last week and even began researching food codes in my area. I just need some capital to get started but I am totally going to do this. Would be great at the university in town, wish I was at MIT.

Also, other people on here are saying we shouldn't tip "pennies." Well that's what got me started saving my bitcoins someone tipped me several cents. Intrigued, I took the last several dollars on my debit card and bought btc. Now I've saved that money and even made a little bit since I bought at 340 per btc. So I dont see how exposing people to bitcoin, however small, is a bad thing.  Also, the OP's pigeon analogy was clever. Nice.

Haha the whole hotdog stand, eh? Thanks!

Too late for a little bit?

Nobody cares. Now excuse me, I'm walking to walmart to buy a chair for fifteen dollars then smash it to pieces because I can.
