Wow, that is alarmingly close. So basically, there are two possible outcomes that will take effect on March 11.
1. The SEC approves it and the price skyrockets.
2. The SEC doesn't approve it and the price continues as normal.
Am I understanding this correctly?

Why wouldn't those shareholders just buy bitcoin for themselves?

Well shit. Those are very different outcomes then. But why would it fall just because people think the SEC will approve the ETF?

May I ask why you personally chose the Nano S over other hardware wallet options?

Budget isn't really a question when it's basically your safehouse for a very valuable asset. I'd like to focus less on budget and more on security and sustainability. 
I've done some research, but it's just that I want to ask for second opinions, hopefully from people who have owned these wallets or similar hardware wallets.

Thank you, it's very helpful that you can compare the two.
If I recall correctly, Trezor once offered a limited edition stainless steel version. I really wished they had that regularly.
Did you get a Cryptosteel with your Trezor? I'd also like to hear more reviews on that.

Thank you, I'll do more research on the links you sent. Do you have plans on updating the Ledger Blue with USB C anytime soon?

Yeah I plan on getting a Cryptosteel if I end up choosing the Trezor. Did you ever have problems with the Trezor's material like what mentioned?

Okay I see, thank you for your input.
