My first Bitcoin transaction was pretty recent. Maybe April or so. I used it so I could make a purchase on Silk Road, bought some Armodafinil in preparation for Diablo III release (Yeah, that's the kind of guy I am). It all went very smoothly and felt pretty good. And if you're curious, the Armodafinil also worked very well, managed to play for 48 hours straight when the game came out.

Nope. If they get back into weapons sales they'll be keeping it separate.

This article is missing some minor information, so I thought I'd just copy and paste the announcement from the Silk Road forums.

That's pretty cool. I may have to try it out pretty soon. I'm still not sure how it works though. The BitInstant website seems terribly unhelpful in describing what actually needs to be done to use the services.
