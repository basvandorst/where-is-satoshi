The Foundation Fighting Blindness is a very worthy cause that would greatly appreciate any donation.

Hey, that Dutch guy sold his house and put it in BTC in October. I'm not even going all-in.

I'm not sure if you're stilling reading comments on this thread, but I thought I would recommend a charity that I and my family support.

Could be a cat bounce. I think the Asian markets will knock it down lower.

Also, there's a 400 btc sell wall at 13600 on GDAX. If it punches through that wall, it could stabilize above the current level. Just my opinion. Look at the long term charts with the EMA 12/26 overlays. It looks like we're not at the bottom yet.

Are you thinking of the CanaDough episode? That one was really more about micro-transactions on games, but it hits on some of the same points.

Thanks for the tip. I read up on dollar cost averaging. It's a good strategy. I'm already having a hard time with the FOMO. I've been trying to free up money since this summer so I could invest. I've already missed out on a very sizeable return due to circumstances outside of my control so I'm worried that if I don't take a nice position now, I'll be kicking myself next week. But I'm also a little worried about what's gonna happen this weekend to the price. Dollar cost averaging might be the best way to go about it. If I'm gonna HODL then there's no better time than the present to practice discipline.
