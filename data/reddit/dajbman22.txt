What does this have to do with bitcoin?

This kind of reads like something John Nash would write when he's off his meds... There was a lot of word soup at the end there.

If she is giving them away so voluntarily, sounds more like dogecoin to me.
@_date: 2014-05-23 19:22:41
At least she wasn't buying Dogecoin.
Actually if it is ever going to gain traction, *now* would be a great time to invest heavily in Doge.

I think you're begging to get yourself and the very concept of crytocurrency mocked on daytime TV.

Or he just needs supplies to make a kickass collage.

You see, if this were posted to it would be hilarious self parody. Being so up-voted here feels mean-spirited. Bit and Doge aren't in direct competition. 
Also While a ~2*0*% jump over the past week is awesome, it's not exactly an Appolo mission. 
edit: fixed missing zero

It's a hell of a lot more likely than them discussing ways to "cull the heard" using vaccines and fluoride or sending hitmen after Jesse Ventura.
Honestly, though, I feel like if it comes, it will be a pretty cursory discussion. Maybe in a few years as its market presence grows and value stabilizes, it will be a bigger concern for the powers that be, but for now it is probably just a blip they have an eye on. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 19:32:47
Exactly. I am skeptical it will ever hit much higher than its initial bubble. If we're not seeing a mini-bubble here, my guess the highest it will stabilize will be no more than $1k/BTC. I am no economist, but my expectations are muted based on the shape of the value curve. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 15:55:28
Yeah, I did.
@_date: 2014-05-23 19:56:02
Yeah, but we've got Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 18:07:14
That's a silly question to ask. The real question is when Bitcoin will hit $28Million. My guess is by lunchtime tomorrow.
@_date: 2014-05-23 19:42:28
If it is your life savings and you were buying up BTC when it was going up (read: buying high, falling into "to the moon" mentality)... I suggest pulling out. Life savings should be kept in something relatively stable, and BTC is a *very* high risk investment at this stage in its life. Maybe keep one BTC in the game once you break even, if $500 is something you can live with potentially losing, and let it ride long term.

I was taking a jab at the fact this week Bit is up and Doge is down (and taking a hell of a publicity beating for it). The second part though, shows my faith it could potentially have a future. It's less than 6 months old, way too soon to know. The silver lining is that if you're a gambling man, with Doge at an almost all time low, it's a great time to buy low. 
I am both a bitcoin user and a shibe, and want both currencies to succeed. I also accept both are very volatile still (with Doge being even more fragile). 
@_date: 2014-05-29 18:20:30
Exactly. Once they consider it enough of a serious alternative to fiat, they'll just diversify and buy up enough market share to get a slice of both pies.

What would make you think I would facetiously use hyperbole on the internet to amplify the position an original poster took? That would just be silly.
@_date: 2014-05-26 02:14:23
Wow, you are a conservative thinker. I would put it at a googolplex by Wednesday. To the moon of the second planet of Alpha Centuri!

I was set up on Coinbase in under 15 minutes. Their rate isn't terrible, nor are their bank fees. Honestly unless you're exchange large sums of cash to bitcoin, it is incredibly fast and easy.

So you finally admit you're mostly a bunch of children playing babby's first speculation game with your allowance from mommy and daddy. How big of you to come to terms with this.
