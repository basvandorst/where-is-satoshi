HODL the door :) 
He he, Congrats
@_date: 2019-06-21 18:20:23
Thanks for this link. Will check it out
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:22:04
Thanks for the info.  didn't know coinbase account can just use gdax directly.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:26:16
and soon crashing at the same rate,  hopefully
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:27:30
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:45:00
s2x fork has replay protection
Edit: I guess not.  Those greedy schmucks
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:54:31
thanks, good to know
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:25:43
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:43:39
Still waiting for that big crash lol
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:27:45
total crash,  if US govt does it
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:11:27
Doesn't china control most of the mining as well.  If they ban that, won't the cost of btc transactions shoot through the roof?  
Sorry, just trying to understand why everyone is so happy with china ban
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:50:56
is there any credible news source yet?
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:16:40
depends actually
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:04:28
lol, not likely.  every time i convert, changelly is a little cheaper compared to shapeshift.
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:13:26
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:55:29
It could drop way low if US decides to regulate it
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:01:46
It could if all these greedy wall street schmucks lobby the congress
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:58:55
what do you mean ruined his life
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:26:14
i believe ASICs will be obsolete if the 2x fork manages to become the main chain
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:52:58
And what is the big term picture?
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:03:59
true.  but at this stage, i'll just wait till the 2X fork is over to see if it crashes, a too fast raise is never going to be stable
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:59:08
really hope so

lol, someone should hang this poster in 
front of Jp morgan
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:43:00
Too good, ha ha
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:03:45
That is bound to happen sooner or latter.  I think US Govt will soon regulate this as well. The wall street scumbags are too greedy to let this go
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:02:50
I think the whole point is most people with normal PCs will be able to mine.  Hence making the ASICs obsolete.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:34:55


They communicated that they will credit all the BCC.  Around January is what i think
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:48:08
Yes it does.  You need to declare FBAR and any foreign income and pay taxes on that income
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:52:58
And what is the big term picture?
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:30:42
yeah, exactly me.  Still crying that i let it go it at 2000 and scared to enter now
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:03:21
Thanks.  Finally my dash coin conversion is cheaper :)
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:49:41
i think its more like a group of 15 countries that do this.  They each share information to each other about foreign citizens making money.  So its hard to escape tax on foreign income in US right now
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:38:37


In that case, why is the fork going through?
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:54:46
that probably just means it will crash on the fork day
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:05:23
true this
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:06:52
Does this mean the rally will cool down now? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:45:27
Wow, so more Chinese manipulation ahead. Hope they just permanently ban and be done with this
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:04:48
definitely not immune to manipulation. We only need these wall street scum to dirty the pond
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:52:14
clarify this for noobs please,  are you saying s2x can still take over bitcoin or co-exist at higher price?
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:20:24
She rocks with that message
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:57:54
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:00:27
wow, maybe do a small part.  Don't risk in case it crashes after this 2x fork
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:06:08
Can there be a price impact on actual bitcoin after this fork?  Or will it just be like the time bcash was created?
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:17:28
I read somewhere that the BTG guys are planning a pretty strong replay protection
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:26:58
If the 2x fork becomes main chain,  mining should be profitable again
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:08:57
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:41:14
well said
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:58:38
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:27:58
lol, i have 2 old phones sitting idle at home.  Should do this at work
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:53:19
i hope it falls to 2k soon
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:03:47
nice video, i'm surprised so less views
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:13:52
Not for the first purchase.
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:00:58
Hi, I'm new too but as per this thread, you will keep all your BTC intact with coinbase. If you transfer to electrum, you will have all your BTC and equal amount of BCC. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:03:59
Anyone who buys on purse? Are the charges always like this. I'm trying to buy for 45.95$. It's asking 49$ payment from my coinbase
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:12:24
Thank you. This is exactly what i wanted to know :)
@_date: 2019-05-08 14:32:15
How does taxation work if you bought btc and kept transferring it out of your account to another's account ?
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:13:05
Thank you. I will try the app.
