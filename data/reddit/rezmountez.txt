Oh.  My btc got stolen in multibit wallet.  Are u using windows? 
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:22:38
lol sorry guys. I'd tried to track up my stolen bitcoin and this is the address at the end. Just suspicious. Look at the public note.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:55:26
hmm. I don't think so. I've remote control my PC just now and doesn't detect any key logger processes in task manager. And also it have been about 2 months i didn't touch that PC (i'm away from hometown). password cracker maybe? @_@

i believe my wallet had been uploaded to hacker via malware from torrent. But why AVAST?? 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:19:39
About ten, all random. Is there any available wallet password cracker out there?
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:04:38
We are same bro. I think there is no way you could get your btc unless the hacker suddenly become a good man, then he could return back your btc.  
The btc transaction is irreversable, not like paypal, which u could make report and claim back the stolen money(for example).  Btw, may i know which wallet do u use? 
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:09:23
perhaps because of torrent downloading. *sigh

Yeah totally sucks. Just planned to buy PS4 with it. Too bad. Alt coins,  here i come!  Bitcoin too pricey. :-[ 
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:20:07
I'd tracked my stolen bitcoin and end up to this address. Not sure whether he start a new business and start buying back BTC or just stealing others.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:25:38
Hmm. Not sure. Only my 14years old brother and younger sister are right there in my house.(who usually use PC). Else my mother n father. I dont think so they know about BTC at all. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:19:39
Back to the earth!
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:30:16
no. i think he lost everything,make note. then start stealing back! just an assumption.
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:33:41
What do u mean by correction?
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:50:08
I got two identical wallet both in PC and Linux. The one got hacked is the PC one. So, how do i delete the key in future? As u said the malware still can search for deleted files
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:46:12
How about XE.com? Which bitcoin site does it refer to? 
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:27:44
should look at the note.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:47:04
I think my wallet got hacked because of virus from torrent download. I got two identical wallet in both Linux laptop and Windows PC. My mistake is that i keep storing BTC in home Windows PC(which everyone in family using it). So, maybe one of my siblings accidentally clicked virus link or download some torrent. (just my theory) Then, the malware from the torrent secretly browse for my wallet and upload it to the culprit. But how do he crack the password? its Alphanumericsymbol dude! ^$$
