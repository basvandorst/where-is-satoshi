I'm going to launch Bitcoin Spot.  It will be the true vision of Spotoshi and will in no way be confused with spot Bitcoin.

There isn't really a single definition of socialism.  The spectrum of self-defined 'socialists' goes from just wanting a 'living wage' right through to UBI, universal healthcare and education etc.
Most socialists are against corporatism though, especially in banking - and BTC is as anti-bank as you can get.

There is no problem here.
Consider the case of a borrower who is able to pay back immediately (i.e. the borrower has 30,000 btc and borrows 100,000 btc from a lender).  They immediately pay back 130,000 btc and all is well (although their finance savvy is in serious question).
In the case that the borrower does not have 30k btc lying around, we can assume that the borrower has some income (why would you lend to someone with no income?!).  Since btc is the global currency, they are paid in btc.  They pay back over time and simply pay back 30k more than they borrowed.  Where does the extra btc come from?  Well it comes from their future earnings from their employer, who got it from selling goods / service to customers, who got it from their employer...
However, since BTC is deflationary, I think we are likely to see very low and ~~no~~ *(edit, terrible idea, thanks* u/jmw74*)* interest loans, simply because a future bitcoin is often going to be worth more than a present bitcoin (in terms on spending power).

I assume that the velocity would be taken into account when the interest rate on the loan is decided.  Since bitcoin is deflationary can we assume that, over time, people will borrow less in terms of total btc?  Will this converge to something sustainable?
If defaults go up, then lenders will need to dip into their reserves to meet their own obligations, however it's not clear whether this will 'cancel out' the impact of the default on velocity.
It is interesting to me however that there is incentive to increase scarcity of circulating btc so that one's own holdings increase in purchasing power, but not so much that it renders the currency useless.
Thanks for the interesting thinking points.

I think I understand what you're saying, but it assumes that the lendor is not circulating any of their btc.
Assuming btc is circulating, the 'same' bitcoin can be used to pay 2 btc of debt.  For example, John owes me 2 btc.  He pays me 1 btc.  I pay my employee Sally 1 btc wage.  She buys a service from John for 1 btc.  John gives me 1 btc again.
In this example, john has paid a debt to me of 2 btc, but there was only ever 1 btc in circulation.
I *think* this gets around your example of having more outstanding debt than there are bitcoins, but I may have misunderstood.  This assumes that there is circulation though.  If ~~the lender is~~ (edit) all lenders are hoarding then I agree there is a problem.
(edit) I think we potentially have the same problem with fiat too though.

Perhaps what we'll see is that repayment rates decrease over time to allow for a natural slowing of velocity as btc deflates, rather than having fixed repayment amounts.
e.g. I lend John 2btc.  He repays 1btc, then 0.75, then 0.5 then 0.25 for a total repayment of 2.5btc.
I'm just guessing now though.  Good post.

ahh, good point
