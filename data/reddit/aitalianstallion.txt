We are due for a 30-50% pull back, I don't like the risk/reward here.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:58:21
Let me tell you about this thing called Ethereum....
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:15:35
Best of luck, kid
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:25:43
It will just cause more stabilization imo
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:31:36
okay cool, I am going to try. Thanks bro!
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:14:41
You need to change the view from "in a few months" to "in a few years" if you want to have any emotional stability over the next few months.

Send to me.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:13:42
Well my friend, you may be picking one of the worst times.
I would set an order for around 10K and come back within a few weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:25:01
have you used this?
@_date: 2018-05-17 05:56:50
I'd like to broadcast from the full node if I am running one.
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:35:59
Fork of XMR. they even forgot to change "XMR" in some of the code when it forked. Hilarious.
@_date: 2018-05-15 18:23:05
I suppose it may be Fungible "to a certain degree" but I am looking for true fungibility. 
Custody service is starting to roll out, combine that with developing ledger auditing software and I see a real (sad) possibility of some coins being "black-listed" due to (claimed) dirty addresses that the coin has touched in the past.
@_date: 2018-05-15 18:36:54
I disagree, while a KYC may be done, once the coins are withdrawn onto own private keys, the coin is then not traceable and thus, fungible.
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:40:24
Are you expecting Hyper Inflation?
The word "implode" is broad, saying "history" makes the statement even broader.

Am I able to print out paper cold storage directly from Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:04:55
Due to it's clear volatility, do you see it dropping back below a $600 price mark in the near future? I would hate to buy in at an all-time high and then see it drop.
Now one clearly cannot say for sure, I am simply looking for an opinion.
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:28:33
Is one able to purchase fractions of Bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:28:18
There will be ETF's related to Bitcoin? Interesting.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:26:44
It goes below 1,000 tomorrow...
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:37:34
I am going all in.
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:37:37
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:05:36
ahhh, I had a failed transfer earlier doing a conversion.
This makes sense.
@_date: 2017-03-23 18:03:06
can anyone dumb this down - I am a noob.
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:31:53
Mine just went through as well...
@_date: 2017-03-23 19:23:41
What would this due for a random holder like myself?
It sounds like this could destabilize the coin?
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:37:11
ayyyyyyyyy sub 1,000 hit

is BU literally a different version of BTC? I am confused.
@_date: 2019-03-28 15:52:37
and at this moment he knew, he fucked up
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:04:48
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:04:40
Anyway to know which coins they are going to buy? I would assume towards the top of the market cap.
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:14:07
So in theory, you feel that is bad for Bitcoin. why not just buy Litecoin?
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:26:16
Found the XRP holder ;]
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:46:33
I don't follow?
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:44:07
It will go up.
It will go down.
It will stay the same.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:46:30
Do not sell, there is no bubble.
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:04:42
Lots of value in some of the lower currencies, I would even say some in the top 3 (say XRP) would doesn't have as much future growth as a borderline 10ish like XMR.

the truth behind r/buttcoin, everyone mad they missed the boat, many getting liquidated when shorting, hodlers can be half retarded and still profit if our time preference is anything longer than "get rich quick idiot"
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:42:02
So you're at a net profit?
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:46:42
I have family in San Jose. It's incredibly overpriced and not very nice. Why would you want to live there of all places, if you are retired?
But even if so, it's still very doable. You would just need to give up a few non-essentials due to your location of choice :]
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:32:29
still trying? no...it hasn't even started...still in test net...you probably don't know what you are talking about :]
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:23:53
gotta put that to work before age 30 baby :P
 Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:05:36
lmfao you all are so delusional
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:42:46

@_date: 2017-11-06 19:14:31
I live in Los Angeles, CA....
I just don't like that people are saying "you are wrong" to someone saying they can retire off 1 million. It's quite easy if you live a reasonable life. Do some research on "4% rule" and "trinity study".
You are welcome.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:19:10
lol whatever you do, don't test Ethereum. You will get a transactions confirmed within a few seconds and for less than 1 penny.

You can live off ~$40,000 per year and never work again if invested properly.

cheers brotha
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:27:41
haha my post was a joke mostly but still holds true. There is no need to transfer value with BTC (as of now) when we have ETH.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:50:59
It's much wiser to drive 20 miles outside of the city where prices are a bit cheaper, if that's their choice.
But again, it's still very possible.

I grabbed 5700 as well

haha ayyyyy
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:41:21
I know what a black swan is, I see no resemblance to the current state of Bitcoin Is this because it dipped 1% after making 100% gains in a little over a month?

Comments like this are just concerning when we have other cryptos with great developing teams looking to the future. 
I know not all have this mentality but a "all will be good in some weird way" mind leaves a huge opportunity for failing in the coming future. 
@_date: 2017-04-24 22:24:41
Can you link me to some information regarding this? I am coming from XMR / ETH areas of learning and from the surface, BTC looks like it's dying. I really want to believe in it / invest in it due to it being the OG but want to learn more.
@_date: 2019-01-14 23:58:15
literally "big block" lol
@_date: 2017-09-11 23:05:53
What's the reason the whole price crashed? Maybe I don't have the same vision since I am new, but it seems like as long as other exchanges were stable then it should have only been a 50% retracement or something similar.
@_date: 2019-01-15 00:00:28
@_date: 2017-09-18 05:20:05
What's everyone expecting to happen in late October and November in regards to NYA and another potential split?
Hopefully we don't see another 20, 30, 40, 50%+ dip.

This is the greatest chain I have ever seen.
@_date: 2017-09-11 23:24:22

Who wins?

My only issue with that is, it is comparing to things like NVDA, Djia and Amazon..etc....which IMO, are clear bubbles currently.
Equities bubbly as fook.
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:30:19

What I don't understand is, if these fools supporting SegWit 2x have millions of dollars (which I can assume they do, at minimum)....how come they don't spin up thousands of nodes? It can't be that cheap to rent some digital servers for a month.

Well for one, not everyone can afford Gold. That's a given.
and two, I don't want "high fees", I just feel that sub penny fees like Ethereum aren't necessary.

Volatility will lower as time goes on.
Andreas M. Antonopoulos put it this way:
- Currently the market cap of Bitcoin is very small compared to traditional asset classes, we are like a small boat in a huge ocean.
- Traditional asset classes are like large boats (large market caps), so small and medium sized waves (buys and sells with large valuations) rarely effect them (volatility).
- Due to our small boat (market cap), small and medium sized waves really effect us.
- We have been rapidly getting a bigger and bigger boat, the Yacht shoulder arrive in 2018.

Aside from this one move, is there any other moves you'd like to talk about? I can name many for BTC. There is even the opinion that LTC pumped due to BTC FUD which could end soon....

@_date: 2017-07-17 22:07:27
From my limited understanding, this is what I have come to agree with. It seems like the UASF is the people standing up for the "true" idea of Bitcoin.
Why do some people have so much negative feelings towards the core devs? Because of this "censorship" you speak of?
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:44:11
Can anyone explain what this means?

Generally (and historically) speaking, my original statement stands. Although yes, you can nitpick a single point where my statement can be wrong. I tend to look at things long term which is why I mentioned stock market level returns and "many years". Looking at "Feb to July" wasn't what my post was explicitly stating.

It's cool that Litecoin has such a "warm and fuzzy" culture (which is something you should always be worried about) but let's look at the fact that Litecoin made stock market level returns over the past few years while BTC has doubled many times over.
