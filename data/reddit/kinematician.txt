When you say 2x long, do you mean doubling your holdings of a coin with borrowed fiat?

Post history is irrelevant. Question was interesting, and got a good answer.

I guess choose a better exchange with lower fees? It's disingenuous to call it mugging though. They are running a business and not a charity after all - you're paying them for access to a market of other people you can buy from / sell to, and for the infrastructure to operate the market. Seems reasonable.

Thanks for the explanation.
Just to check I've got this straight, say BTC/USD is at 1000. You deposit 1 BTC into your exchange account, then place a buy order for 1 BTC with 2x leverage. At this point you owe the exchange $1000, but have BTC worth $2000 on account.
In the worst case scenario that the price drops 50%, your BTC position is only worth the $1000 you owe the exchange, so a margin call is made and your BTC is liquidated to close the leveraged position.
Does that sound right? Have I got it right that you owe the exchange $1000 which is secured against your deposit, or do you owe them 1 BTC?

Bizarre. Thanks for the explanation. I would have thought this would be a bad thing when the mempool is backed up, but I guess it actually makes no difference. Now to read up about how the network assembles a new block...

Can't argue that that's a rip-off. Not every exchange is that extortionate though.

...and how many are Bitcoin supporters keeping tabs on what's going on with BCH?

A more benign reading of the situation (exchanges / wallets setting higher than necessary fees) would be that they don't want to scare off new or naïve users with transactions that take hours to confirm, but they overcompensate by using poor algorithms that are too insensitive to the current demands on the network. Hence the overpayment.
I would hope that we could move towards better education on the subject, and better UX around making payments. It's not so hard to understand that you have a choice as to how quickly your TX gets confirmed, and that sooner costs more, especially when it's busy. Better to inform users and offer the choice, I think.

Right, makes sense. Thanks again for the explainer!
