Will definitely consider it for the future - it took about 16 months to flesh out all the details and finally get the CFO/CEO on board with creating an account with Coinbase so I'm hesitant to throw a curveball into the mix. We are likely larger than the average BTC merchant ($50MM-60MM/yr) so there are a lot of internal approvals needed for seemingly small decisions.

Hi! We've looked at a number of options (including BIPS) for accepting BTC payments. However, our most urgent need is to be able to acquire Bitcoins in order to pay contractors. Are you strictly a payment processor or do you also delve into exchange activity?
We've kind of hit a brick wall with Coinbase; they say we can't buy BTC instantly with a PO Box address, but in our rural area, all USPS service is PO Box strictly. Hard to believe that this entire population of people cannot acquire BTC through Coinbase (instantly, at least).

Thanks - I've browsed that site, but I'm afraid that will not be an option for our company at this point. 
Our AP dept requires all purchases be completed through an exchange that they, too, have access to for auditing purposes.

Hi Robin! I just PM'd you. I did get a canned reply from support just now (pretty much the exact same answer that comes up when you google "coinbase error2").
I would appreciate anything you can do to help us resolve this so we can join the economy. Thanks!

They apparently don't allow PO Boxes for billing addresses :/
