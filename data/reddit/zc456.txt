And the chances of getting a counterfeit dollar while still believing it's genuine is just as high as Bitcoin's value crashing tomorrow. Speaking of crashing, let's not forget the political mess that lead the constant rise in inflation and economic collapse following the present rescission the US is currently in. If the dollar wasn't a risk, we (not just you and I) wouldn't be talking about it today.

Mtgox goes down, Coindesk goes up. :D

Yeeah, credit cards [aren’t any better]( What's worse is they don't use the public-private key method - **or similar**. Otherwise giving your credit card number would be like sharing your public key.

I've purchased software with Bitcoin even while the transaction was still being confirmed.
@_date: 2014-01-22 08:30:58
In some aspects, not all. But it's a positive start.
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:25:42
The dollar isn't risky?
@_date: 2014-01-21 05:03:51
It's a currency.
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:27:08
I've heard this too many times to believe it.
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:40:21
Speaking of which, last I checked terrorists groups were around before Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-14 07:21:54
Keep in mind, 1 BTC is not $1.
@_date: 2016-06-20 10:44:59
I doubt it'll happen but I'm all for the cause. X)
@_date: 2016-06-14 05:05:12
[Bitsquare]( seems to be out to address this.
@_date: 2016-06-14 06:47:02
Then who puts the clothes in each?
@_date: 2016-06-19 11:21:33
Lemme just hard code some fees that go to my wallet into the code.
@_date: 2016-06-14 20:37:35
But I never said they would.
@_date: 2012-11-15 09:45:27
How could any of that happen when it's all anonymous?
@_date: 2012-11-13 12:20:24
I don't get it. Bitcoin is open source and has no central bank. So there's nothing to restrict. Greed comes regardless of weather it's an ISO standard or not. It's still just currency in the end and that's part of the package, no matter who or what is in control.
@_date: 2012-11-16 03:47:53
Just the address. It doesn't contain any personal info about the person themselves, not to mention it's encrypted like hell.
@_date: 2012-11-13 12:30:41
@_date: 2012-11-10 22:10:41
I doubt making it a standard would do that.
@_date: 2012-11-19 12:24:21
Your constricting yourself way to much and the fact that you argue "encryption does not matter" just means this conversation is over with. I've heard of other digital currencies where there wasn't any security at all and people got hacked right away, let alone the fact they were all centralized, unlike Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-10 04:47:19
What's life without risks? Anyway, if no big company jumps in and takes it, how will it mature?
@_date: 2015-03-19 12:01:08


I'd rather take my chances with Bitcoin then expose my debt or credit card number.
@_date: 2016-07-09 22:44:44
Miners get payment in transaction fees even after all Bitcoins have been mined.
@_date: 2016-07-24 17:31:27
That might be a little bit more work. At present, open source social networks today are mainly federated but are still centralized at it's core.
@_date: 2016-07-09 22:13:19
Not all mining is profit. Although profit is the primary motive, it also doubles in verifying transactions that create the blockchain. Even after all bitcoins have been mined, payment will be made from transaction fees.
@_date: 2013-09-06 03:46:16
If true: hypocrites.
@_date: 2013-08-10 16:11:09
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:00:40


Scared me there for a moment.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:36:19
Cheers! :D

Last time eBay mentioned Bitcoin, they brought their promotional page down days later. I'll believe it when I see it.
@_date: 2013-10-20 11:55:36
It happens.
@_date: 2013-09-07 03:13:23
Stay classy, eBay.
@_date: 2013-10-18 09:59:51
Especially since the term was around before Bitcoin. So, to argue it's the only currency that used for such tactics is debatable.
@_date: 2013-03-05 07:18:12
How many people have tried this?
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:57:04
NOOOOOOOOoooooooo. Really?
@_date: 2013-09-07 03:44:11
Well, being open source, I doubt it'll leave any time soon. The thing is, it's too early to tell where the market will take it. Bitcoin (and others like it) are still very young compared to the established currencies ran by banks.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:45:44
I'm starting to like China.
@_date: 2013-08-19 23:09:54
Or both platforms.
@_date: 2013-08-20 14:02:10
Well, it's already considered a high risk currency as is for other reasons but porn may ironically help it's image.
@_date: 2013-10-18 15:54:50
Using money maundering as an example of anonymity for a currency I support is not a badge I'd be proud to honour.
@_date: 2013-03-14 05:57:26
Has anyone actually tried this?
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:32:41
Maybe in economics and currency.
@_date: 2013-10-18 09:15:10
Oh, the irony in this is too much.
@_date: 2013-10-27 01:29:19
I'd be rather bombarded by ad banners everywhere.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:36:03
It should stabilize sometime soon. $1 is now 0.95 mBTC.  That's pretty affordable.
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:23:09
Second that.
@_date: 2013-09-06 16:25:42
"We'll hunt you down and destroy you, but we'll still support you!"
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:29:39
Cheers! :D
@_date: 2013-03-14 10:03:56
Ah, okay. Sure! Will do.
@_date: 2013-04-24 06:49:14
Well, Bitcoin is now officially a part of the internet.
