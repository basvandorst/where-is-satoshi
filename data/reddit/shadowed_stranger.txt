When people simplify government regulation as something that magically stops market failure, it makes it hard to take them seriously.  Neither side is really doing anything other than pandering.
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:26:49
I wasn't addressing you with the comparison, so much as the idea that you presented (oversimplification) coupled with the other responses in this thread.  See any of the top posts merely saying "We need regulation" or "We need FDIC insurance" without ever detailing exactly what "regulation" is needed or how it helps, or why insurance can't be provided privately.  
I'd hoped my last comment would have clarified that both sides of this argument really just say what makes them feel better and make their team happy without actually trying to present a cohesive argument.  RE: "Neither side is really doing anything other than pandering."
Sorry for any confusion.

I've got a nexus 4 and htc one and use them both, get an HTC one, you won't be disappointed.  It's a   phenomenal phone.  The nexus is nice too, don't get me wrong, but it is in a different category.  It was meant to be a great phone for the price, while the htc one was never to be a flagship phone.  Everything about the phone feels premium, and the attention to detail is great.  Vanilla android is nice but most of my friends that are just switching to android all seem to prefer the htc sense ui much better as beginners.

I'll be the first to admit, I have zero hesitation for giving my card to potentially shady people or websites because I know that I can get all charges reversed and I won't have to worry about doing a  chargeback if needed.  Hell, I used my card for months on a malware infested PC.  With bitcoin I am way more diligent with how I spend my money and protect myself.

Their business model is even worse.  They take 33% of all profits, and retain admin access to the machines.  If their servers are hacked and the hackers steal the credentials to YOUR exchanges and steal your bitcoins, you're up shit creek because they won't even insure them or provide any guarantees...  Which should be what the absurd 33% payment should be going to.

The dollar will never replace bitcoin and if the only thing you have to say to those who lost all of their cash hidden in a mattress is "should have been smarter.  Next time buddy."  Average people want the protection of undamageable, unseizable, unfreezable currency.
See what I did there?  If some people want that stability and protection (with the associated cost), someone can voluntarily start an exchange to do that.  No one here is arguing against those types of institutions, even if it may sound like they are.  They are arguing against a forced use of said institutions.
Look at what we've seen recently:  There are big names backing up their deposits with insurance and publicly proving their deposits.  Security will be the next 'arms race' in the bitcoin world, just wait and see.

Lots of people have lost (real life) wallets that had lots of cash in them too.  Doesn't mean we should make it illegal to carry cash.
Others have lost lots of valuable things in house fires without insurance.  Make smart decisions, try to help others.  The greedy/lazy/incompetent/stupid will always manage to make decisions that hurt themselves regardless of how many safeguards are in place.

It's satire of the tradehill closing statement.




Due to increasing regulation TradeHill can not operate in it's current capacity without proper money transmission licensing. Combined with multiple bank account closures and Paxum's decision to close all Bitcoin business accounts, we have deemed the best course of action is to halt trading and pursue licensing while raising funds.
SEPA transfers for our Euro customers have been enabled.




It has been a pleasure working with the Bitcoin community and look forward to continuing our business in the future. More details to come soon.

Don't shoot the messenger.  I'm just explaining their logic.
Now.  The government believes they are not doing anything to try to control bitcoin.  And, really, everything they are doing is indirect.  They say 'If you are translating between any other currency and US Dollars, then you must register as X.'  They are, for the most part, leaving the 'all internal' bitcoin alone.

Wrong.  It is just a multisig transaction, it is nothing special.  The oracle has another key that it can use to sign.  That's it.
@_date: 2013-04-21 01:28:03
It will be whatever supply and demand set for each block.  This also has the added bonus of spreading transactions out to times when there are less of them too (think, lower rates for using power certain times of the day.)  Say, for example, that only 5 transactions can be included in each block.  People who need their transactions verified now have more incentive to pay a higher transaction fee so theirs will be processed first.  Those who don't need them immediately can pay a lower fee, and they will be 'queued up' to be processed when there are no higher value transactions.  Think, online orders.  If you order something that won't ship until the next morning, you don't need the payment to go through immediately.  At night when there are less transactions, the miners can 'catch up' on the lower tx fees.  It's a great way to adjust pricing based on supply and demand in real time (every block).

Another scam that has been making the rounds in Vegas, the user asks to buy bitcoin from you then asks you to take a printscreen of where yours says 'escrow funded' so that he can verify that you put the funds in escrow.  This would allow the scammer to withdraw funds from your account, as this screen has an SMS release code.  Please be vigilant when asked anything unusual!

Most people I know in the bitcoin community watch the price like hawks.  I know that if the price drops to $1 (due to a massive sell off) I'm buying tons of bitcoins.


The most powerful supercomputer in the world is 17 petaflops.  The total power of the top 500 supercomputers in the world COMBINED is 162 petaflops.  The bitcoin network is currently over 380 petaflops.  
I want to repeat that, the bitcoin network is over twice as powerful as the top 500 supercomputersin the world, PUT TOGETHER.

In the exchange, or on the ATM.


It is your bitcoin, but the information for retrieving it is stored on their servers.  If they have admin access over all of the ATMs and the ability to withdraw BTC from your exchange accounts, that makes them a very big target for hackers.  If a hacker removes my bitcoin from my accounts/ATMs because of a security vulnerability on their end, I would expect them to refund/insure the BTC at a minimum, especially since they are taking 1/3 of the profit off the top.
