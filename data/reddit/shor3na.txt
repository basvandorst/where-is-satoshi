Id like that, but I think for now bitcoin will play the "bad hacker guys money" role.

Sure, but every transaction would reach you 7000 times, wouldnt it? If we assume 80k per day thats 55 TX from each node per second or ~385k requests per second. Not sure where my mistake is, but that sounds like a lot of traffic.

Makes total sense after all the regulation and licencing they required recently.
"New York’s proposed regulations require digital currency companies operating within the state to record the identity of their customers, including their name and physical address. ..."

Yep, baseless assumption, hence the words "I doubt".
I didnt criticise bitcoin though.
I read he is using bitpay, which usually indicates -&gt; dump to fiat.

Not sure if trolling, but this will obviously not work as nodes tend to limit the number of connections. E.g. home use bitcoin core without configured firewall would not allow this.
The other problem would be to hold a connection to the ~7000 nodes.
And to top if all of, just because said node broadcasted it first via TCP/IP does not mean it is the origin of the transaction. It could have been send to the node via SMS, DVBT or any other way to transmit data that your node does not support and its barely working as a gateway for all we know.
tl;dr: You could guess, but you can never know for sure.

welcome to the club ;)

No, it was recently posted on bitcointalk.org

It should detect and use the system language. There is no way to change it from within the app, but you can try if the app "Localized Apps" can help you.

just 5k TX ;)
@_date: 2014-12-21 18:35:19
Yes and no, the original picture is a bit wrong as there are 2^96 possible privat keys for each address due to the use of RIPEMD-160. Thus the security for a bruteforce attack is only 160 bits. The private key itself is still 256 bit though.
@_date: 2014-12-21 22:19:58
Thanks, we can just split, you did the helpfull answer after all.
150 bits
@_date: 2014-12-21 22:17:10
I actually dont care that much about the price, IIRC i bought at 600$, 700$ and 400$, so I am in for the long run anyway. Id be fine with a stable price if it helps adoption. 
My point is that those *accepting* bitcoin dont actually care about bitcoin or they would hold and pay in bitcoin. If bitcoin is not accepted as a currency but just understand as "something like paypal", its no going to change anything.

reuse of R value is hardly a user error, well unless you are the kind of user that writes his own wallet.
@_date: 2014-12-21 18:43:46
I guess I have overestimated the amount of traffic 7000 nodes would produce, thus the only black spots would be *estoretical broadcasting channels* (who is currently using DVBT anyway), home use clients and torrent nodes.
Dont you have to handle each try to broadcast a TX from the 7k nodes individually?
@_date: 2014-12-21 16:26:07
Just dont keep money on your server. I have *disablewallet* in my config file and run the webserver as info page. I would assume that most people run full nodes on servers to support the network and not as a wallet.

This, but its more of a rundown than a script. Its mostly handmade. If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
@_date: 2014-12-26 14:03:07
makes total sense, time to drop the bombs.
@_date: 2014-12-21 15:22:10
Yes you will contribute even if you are not online 24/7. Every node is relaying transactions and thus helping the network. It also helps that you allow inbount connections. E.g. a new node can connect to you and request parts of the blockchain. And even all that aside you would help the network because of the rise in slim clients (like multibit) used. They need full nodes to get their data, but do not act as a "full connection". The amount download/upload is not as important though. Dont let anyone tell you different, every full node helps.
@_date: 2014-12-21 19:58:47
Yeah, well it would take some time till they reach you, but there are other TX reaching you in the mean time and so on.
I also get that youd only have to process a TX once and drop every other instance of the same TX, but 5000 nodes with 50 tx per second each 200 bytes would still result in ~47MiB/s inbound traffic, even though the majority is dropped.
On the other hand my node holds ~50 connections on average and had &lt;60KiB/s traffic in november, including blocks. 
Thanks for the answers Ill have to think about it more I guess.

I doubt he keeps the coins. As long as all those *adopting* bitcoin, keep dumping them directly on the next exchange for fiat, its not going to help bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-22 10:15:01
No, he was very nice. He used bitcoinj to analyse the network.
@_date: 2014-12-26 11:54:07
I love that guy. Not that I think his ideas should be implemented, but he just nails it - pun intended.
@_date: 2014-12-21 22:41:28
True more uses are nice and important but esp. someone like 50 cent would easily be able to hold at least a certain percentage of the btc income as btc. It would be very different message, as it would show that he personally believes in bitcoin as a currency.
Same with microsoft, their income in fiat covers their expenses anyway (full disclosure I assume), why not hold bitcoin and see if they could incorporate it further.
The big news lately is not adoption, its half hearted. Dont get me wrong, I cant wait for more places to spend bitcoin, but Id also like to see more places offering payment in bitcoin.
I am not sure what a "curmudgeon" is, even the translation to my first language (german) is not helping so Ill just ignore that.
@_date: 2014-12-21 23:48:19
He either wants to be ahead of the curve or he is hiding. The "I accept bitcoin, but instantly exchange it to what I know" way is IMHO not what he wants to be according to his own words.
I just find it odd that a person gets cheered on by the btc community for accepting bitcoin and does presumably not even own any bitcoin. 
Call me crumudgeon for that if you want, my initial comment probably come off more negative than I meant it to be.
Miesepeter is a way better translation than Knicker (pinchpenny) btw, thanks.
