Nah.  She invented credit default swaps, but not the abuse of it.  Can't really blame her for that.  That's like blaming bitcoin for silk road.
Edit.  Credit default swaps not derivatives.

Man, you should offer a discount for using btc.  Kinda pricy...  I bought one anyway.  What is the typical ship time?  Please tell me it's at least priority shipping.
@_date: 2015-06-28 15:49:19
You have had to buy one to take the survey.   So no real use for anyone who already has one.  Also people get to have one for 100 instead of 120 so people might be more inclined to get one, which is good for the bitcoin community. Are you mad? 
@_date: 2014-06-02 02:57:49
One thing is, how the hell are they going to find out?  I mean really?   Anyone buying things under $500 and not cashing out significant amounts should not be claiming anything at all.

When I bought with bitcoin before,  they kept sending me emails on what I ordered and my address and whatnot.  It seems the integration with their existing order software was not jiving.  Maybe that is it.   I got the gold coins shirt and it looks sick and the material is soft.  I recommend them especially with the price being lower than their other retail shirts

There is also a guy named subduction who claimed that he was in a meeting with top fortune 500 people that were in the pos business and asked for help in a thread about what questions to ask. He then gets all involved in the comments, then after said meeting was supposed to happen, he would update us on what they said.
He never updated the thread.

Even if you have a 51% attack, it would have to be extremely coordinated AND extremely lucky, to keep the chain moving along.  It would also be counterintuitive to do this unless you spend more than 51% of the coins just to get your money's worth on double spending.  It's extremely unlikely that even if you did have 51% hashing power AND you double spend, you would ruin btc for you and others
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:17:51

I don't get why you are butthurt about 10% markup.   It's cheaper than local bitcoins and its fast &amp; anon.  If your were to buy from coinbase or other they have a markup too, but you are giving your info and linking a bank account.  Also, its not like you can find a btc atm anywhere.  I think the mark up is reasonable considering the risk and the initial price to set these up.  
@_date: 2014-06-14 13:56:01

I would just throw it away.  Its their fault for sending out an item when you technically didn't pay for it, and now they want you to pay.  its the same as mailing someone something, then asking them to pay for it.

You can sell off market, you will probably get 50 - 70% of market value per btc if you are lucky.  You have to find a buyer to buy that much at once first.  If you are gonna sell it on the markets, you will definitely affect the price.

You can change the confirmation time by changing nonce difficulty.  You can also do what you just said.  Technically, bitcoin could be changed at the code level to change confirmation time.

Is your roulette HONESTLY Provably Fair?  10 reds in a row followed by 2 0's.  And I was betting black.  I know this has to be rigged the probability of that is ridiculous.

So you never heard of Google?  Are you really this dumb?  You should just type every question that you have into the Google search bar, so you don't waste internet space

You are an idiot if you do paypal.  99.99% are scammers

I think it will slowly rise to 250ish, then start to sell.  How far down it goes I have no idea

I wouldnt do it.  I put in 250 from Dwolla to MtGox and its held up in their system.  They rely on the actual exchange to fund their money fronting business and it seems they dont have the cash on hand to handle all the requests.  Their support is shit too.  They post on forums and on here to handle problems to keep their profile as positive as possible when so many people are bitching about they money being held up for weeks on end.  I put in my support ticket and havent heard back in about a week.  Some people almost a month.  It seems the people who run the company are not professional businessmen as they literally post on here and other forums personally.  Should trust my money with a more professional service that actually can backup what they claim.

If you are doing a presentation in front of these million dollar executives and asking people on reddit for advice you are probably way out of your element

Wow what a fast dip and buy back...
@_date: 2013-12-29 18:08:42
I think this is a scam.

What the fuck kinda response is that?  You basically admittes you rip people off, and only reimburse people who notice and complain.  Bitinstant is a shotty business and can't even keep their books in order.   I will never use you again, and I will let everyone know you guys do crappy business and to stay away!
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:42:30
You did the right thing.  Good for you.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:07:57
You guys are such full of shit.  Waiting forever to get my fucking money to MtGox.  Need to start a class action lawsuit with money for damages and lost gains/interest on the $$ that they are holding up.  You guys do bad business
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:47:38
Probably not
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:30:07
Great as in you are looking into it, or great as in I submitted another support query that will take forever to get my money back?  Don't fluff me bro

I was put on high risk, now my pending druid isn't coming thru

It's not up to them.  It's up to us.

I have been on here for a while, and I get tired of the noobs who don't even bother googling their question, let alone search reddit.   They need to be yelled at.
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:36:25
Fucking love it
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:53:54
If you tip bigger than  .01 it will come out to  an actual account of money that someone can use.  No one wants to get bit coin dust that they can't even transfer or use.
@_date: 2013-04-15 11:38:37
Its cool until you find out this guy owns bitibstant which is screwing over its customers
