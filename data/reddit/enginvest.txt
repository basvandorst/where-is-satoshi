Does everyone get these forms? I declared my crypto gains for both 2017 and 2018 including all transactions and I didn't receive any notice from the IRS.

You ain't lying. I think most altcoins will not see their previous atm any time soon as long as btc is still mostly bearish. We had a similar situation last year too until btc dominance dropped to around 35% earlier 2018 and alts had a bullish run.

lol. Some say when the etf is approved institutional money will come in and cause a bull run. Some, like the op, are saying that the price is being manipulated by the institutions. So which one is it?

Yes you're right but I didn't mean it to be put into the calculator this way; just a general info.

&amp; change = (current price - previous price / previous price) \* 100&amp; thus,
 (6,327-2,478/2,478) \*100&amp; = 155.33&amp;
