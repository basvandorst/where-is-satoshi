It's also amazing how some can remain so ignorant.

That explains the bitcoin market of the last couple months perfectly. There was the takeoff at ~$45. The first sell off was at ~$75, I remember them dropping to ~$55. The media attention, enthusiasm and greed have been obvious. People have been incredibly delusional lately. Every post I've seen has been filled with comments saying "it's only the beginning" and "they will never crash". The denial has been obvious with the "buy now!" comments. The bull trap was probably around $105-120. It could have "returned to normal" at $200. It's at $165 as I'm writing this.

I don't understand why people are encouraging Kim Dotcom's promotion of Bitcoins. He doesn't have the greatest record when it comes to promotion of ideas.

THIS. I am very tired of the constant circlejerking in this subreddit lately. As bitcoins are falling at $100 an hour, I must say, I am laughing at all of the people who have convinced each other that they are invincible.

I totally understand why people think 4chan is terrible, but it still allows you to express your opinions and be heard. The more disturbing parts of the site (which aren't as common as most people think) just keep uptight people and kids away.

I'm 14500 in the queue. I have been trying to get verified with bitfloor but they won't let me upload my ID. Anyone else have this problem?

lol I'm no investor. Unlike most of the people on this subreddit, I used bitcoins. I just happened to have ~15 of them from when they were less than $30.
@_date: 2013-06-29 22:49:04
Makes sense. I just thought something might have happened since the price hasn't dropped this low in quite a while.

Yeah, I left class early because my university's servers somehow blocks the connection to the bitcoin network, making it so I can't access my wallet.

Yeah, getting angry probably means I have some serious issues. Anger often hides anger. I will definitely get checked out for my anger problem covering up my anger problem. Thanks man.

I don't post on facebook. Also, I am human and have emotions. Seeing people complain brings out those emotions (specifically anger).

You don't need more mods. You need a better, less bias website, uncontrolled by the opinions of others.

Update: I tried it with my BTC-e account also and it is still doing the same thing. Can I just have some confirmation that this is happening to other people?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:58:28
For what?
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:11:56
I noticed this within an hour of being on the site. The vastly overused memes, circlejerking and overall lack of diversity (caused by the ridiculous karma system) was a clear giveaway. I mostly visit Reddit for Bitcoin updates. The typical user of the main subreddits is arrogant and only wants to sound smart. Honestly, I browse 4chan instead. The community is completely opposite. This post will probably get down voted to oblivion, but it's true. Just sign out of Reddit and take a look at the front page.

Anyone who blindly agreed with the praisers are part of the group I am referring to.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:41:47
I over exaggerated a bit to get my point across, but I can't help feeling somewhat satisfied.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:31:28
Yeah, I am only subscribed to a few subreddits and those alone frustrate me with the constant competition and whoring. I usually try to stay away from reddit. But I will give some credit because it keeps me updated without having to put much effort into it.

The funny thing is, when you buy Bitcoins you aren't investing a company. Bitcoins are a currency, that is meant to be spent. The more people "invest" the more worthless it becomes. Fuck all of you "investors" you have no idea what you are doing. It's offensive to the people who actually believe in Bitcoins. In the long run you're hurting the cause.
