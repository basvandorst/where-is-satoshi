A little piece of advice:- pay the tax. It is a small price for peace of mind. You can go about life with a clean conscience, knowing your taxes helped pay for some road or Medicare or school or whatever, and you will have no need to worry about someone swooping, catching you in some kind of random data trawl or data leak, and eventually hitting you with fines, penalties, criminal evasion charges and quite possibly serious jail time. The US IRS may be slow but there is a very long list of people who thought they were clever and who eventually  got caught. The US does not screw around on taxes. In the end it is cheaper to be clean.

This is not true. I have sold several businesses in my career and my banks - including one in Switzerland - all asked for evidence of where the sudden influx of wealth came from. It is standard anti-money laundering activity.
EDIT: downvoted for giving accurate information. Nice.

Using another currency as a measuring stick is one thing (although even that is a little wrong-headed; the relative values of currencies are used to assess the condition of an underlying economy that issues the currency. That is different for Bitcoin).
Seeing Bitcoin as nothing but a mechanism to deliver more units of another currency is what I find disappointing. It misses the main point of BTC, which was to create decentralized money outside that very system. Hence just using it to move all the value back into the system is counterintuitive.

This is what kills me when I hear people say it has no intrinsic value. That is wrong. It is so different to a normal currency as it includes the payment processing, security and accounting infrastructure, things which are secondary to normal cash currencies. Owning BTC is more like owning a share than a dollar.

Somebody should fork core and create another Bitcoin Cash. Biter bit.

Disagree. Spending and "cashing out" are not the same thing. One has the mentality that Bitcoin is a speculative bet that creates wealth in another, more real and spendable form. The other sees Bitcoin as a fundamental part of everyday life that has disintermediated other forms of payment.

Actually not. The interstate system was started in 1956, and the first block only completed in 1991. That investment created thousands of jobs.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:44:49
Why would you view the goal as being to "cash out"? That is almost literally equating owning BTC with gambling - you cash out your chips at the blackjack table or whatever. I'm fine with you wanting to spend it on something, but "cashing out" to another "safer" currency is another mentality entirely.

When  the internet first got going there were no hacking laws, the concept of the internet was as poorly understood as crypto today, and most of what we do today on Reddit was going on in BBSs and Usenet. I was online in the early 1980's, accessing all kinds of things via PADs.

I can understand the enthusiasm but honestly you should just ignore this kind of daily movement. 
Bitcoin is a tiny asset class today, but if demand for the currency increases as it should in the coming 5-10 years, you will be adding at least one zero to each BTC, perhaps much, much more. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:08:53
Did you switch your mains power off at the switchboard? If not then that is the issue. Your coins are probably being choked and are backing up at the main breaker. Make sure to leave it off for at least 24 hours otherwise the fuse doesn't reset and all your coins will autoconvert into Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:45:21
That's bullshit. You guys are deliberately destroying the goodwill and faith upon which Bitcoin is built, not those defending it from your clutches. A reasonable person would sit down and think about this, not force their views and financially-driven agendas on an entire ecosystem.
The Xapo statement was as stupid as saying "if a powerful minority decide they a want to take something, fuck you Jack."
Well, no. Fuck you Xapo and everyone else who thinks they can commandeer Bitcoin. Bitcoin - pure BTC, not some BS half-assed, ill-conceived and badly executed usurper - has a built-in loyalty to a set of behaviors which you are betraying by inept sleight of hand and dumb-as-donuts statements, by people who frankly should know better.
I moved every coin I owned on Xapo to a Ledger HW wallet today and as soon as I can split I will dump whatever you guys create for more pure Bitcoin. Xapo made a statement, and I made a decision. That's the market deciding, right?
You should honestly hang your head in shame. Your reputation is in tatters.

What I despise about the SegWit2X methodology is how they try to cram it down our throats by deliberately polluting the two block chains with no RP. It's not a hard fork, it's a messy, sloppy fork. If you believe in the tech, do it right: own the fork, keep it clean, let it stand on it's own feet, and try to persuade people to buy and use it. That's a fair way. That's what Ver did. OK it failed and some people lost some money, but that was a decent attempt and the market has genuinely decided. Just trying to hijack the ecosystem with BS and dirty work is wrong. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:57:13
Where is now the market is deciding?

When you consider what they will do for peanuts, the motivation to deliver an almost riskless but very significant score must be enormous.
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:25:16
If it's not a huge part of your portfolio it is an easy risk to take. It's just an asset class with a risk-adjusted expected return.

As much as BCH was dumb, Ver at least made it clean. He owned it, win or lose. This crew wants to make it as messy as possible just to create opportunity through chaos.
