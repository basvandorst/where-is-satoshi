Yes, they are bad actors and clearly big-blockers with their bcash fiasco.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:03:47
They're big blockers by NOT supporting Segwit, and their jump-scare launch of Bcash--a coin which violates nearly every aspect of their digital asset framework for adding new coins.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:14:19
Oh, they know how to. They're deliberately hobbling.

Just transferred to my CB USD wallet. Thanks for explaining this.
@_date: 2017-02-13 04:50:28
Exactly. Coinbase is insured against that. The 2FA comment was just mentioned as good practices. If someone hacked the password, that's not covered.

@_date: 2017-03-07 03:59:43
Was there an answer?
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:00:05
Don't they already own 100,000 BTC? That's a B right there.
@_date: 2017-03-23 20:23:09
This does not seem accurate at all. BTC =/= BTU.
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:53:22
ok, then go into the charts and determine the market value price on the day you received them (for yr basis), and that should be safe enough. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:04:24
I watched my shit sink from ~$800 to $250 and cashed out one coin at $575. Did I buy when it was at $250, even though I had the means? No. Do I regret it every day? YUP.
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:02:27
1) Hodl; wait for the crash and buy moar.
2) Hodl; wait for the rise and hodl on like Eddie Money.
3) Sell and regret selling in a year or less.
@_date: 2017-03-31 13:02:36
You sure?
@_date: 2017-03-11 23:21:39
I'm gonna wager the answer is no. This is why you should have set up Google Authenticator (more secure) or Authy, because neither of those require connectivity.
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:56:48
respect due for you filing proper taxes, by the way!

Not my problem. I was one of those 802.
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:55:43
You need to find out what your friend's cost basis was on the date of the gift. That's the average cost he paid of the *total* coins they held at that particular day. From there, you also record the cost the day you sell and enter all of that in your taxes in 2018. 
    
@_date: 2017-03-23 17:02:13
Plus you can sell your BTU to some ignoramus.
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:13:55
They're not wrong.
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:18:55
There is no BTU. Therefore, it's not on Poloniex.

@_date: 2017-03-20 00:30:09
BTU does not exist. That's futures trading.
@_date: 2017-03-11 07:59:06
The coin won't show up into your account for a week, but your bank account will be debited either way. Then, it'll take another 7 days for the money to get you out of the red to credit back into your account--provided you sell.
Additionally, if you sell, you're going to pay short gains tax on your 2.3 BTC sale come tax time 2018. (Unless you have old coin you can use to mitigate that.)

Good luck in life.

And for the record, the ETH purchases do not do this on CB.. only BTC right now.

This guy has videos about chemtrails on his page. That's all you really need to know.
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:36:14

@_date: 2017-03-15 16:29:27
what anarchists!
@_date: 2019-03-02 05:15:59
Probably because coins can't be tracked as easily. I never considered this before, but was originally very upset by the "WHY NOT CHANGE TO BTC?" angle.
@_date: 2017-03-31 00:27:59
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:37:23
What does this mean, however? If you hold BTC on Coinbase and there is indeed a hard fork creating a BTU altcoin, are you never able to access it? 
Can you move said BTC to another exchange and BTU will....magically appear?
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:39:09
that's the way she goes, rick.
@_date: 2019-03-05 18:00:03

The word you're looking for is "peek" as in, "Brock grabbed the lotion and peeked into the boy's locker room."

The coins are always on the blockchain. Hardware wallets are essentially secure keys that are inaccessible to the internet (and hackers).

Jihan Fucking Wu.

Yes, but if you recorded your private key and kept it safe, your coin is accessible with another wallet.

That man proposing in that video was in fact Rene himself. And the video is being used to promote his ~2 month-old "$0/donations suggested" photo scanning/archiving startup.

$200 profit is laughable when you consider short-term gains. 
Providing you pay taxes.

Interesting choice by using Swedish House Mafia, who literally fooled a whole hell of a lot of people into thinking they were actually physically DJing, when instead they were playing pre-mixed CDs. They made hundreds of millions. But once their ruse was figured out -- *POOF!!*  Retirement  :)

If you're worried about losing less than $50 dollars in a day, whether from stocks, bitcoin or a casino, may I suggest that you should reconsider investments or risky endeavors at all.

LOL. Get help.
