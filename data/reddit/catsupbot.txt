Of course not.  Because donations to charities are the way to cash out crypto tax free

Who cares about how lame something is, when that something is making you a shit-ton of money?
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:46:18
Depends on who controls the addresses that receive the donations. If they have a relationship with the person donated it is easily argued that the donator isn't losing a dime.

This is like an example from a high school ethics class. And a bad one at that, for reasons someone else already spelled out. So childish.

What about mimicking subs like r/fantasyfootball where when you click an up or downvote a little graphic expands out from the arrow

"Rule one is don't lose money." Is also investment advice.

He didn't say how much he bought. Just that he bought in at 450.
@_date: 2016-12-24 01:45:41
Are you able to buy in at all right now? Obviously not 7 coins worth. But something?

Don't waste your energy on this guy. Everyone thinks they're a genius investor in a bull market. The fact that he still works a salaried job should tell you he's not the buffet of crypto that he sees in the mirror. Kids like this are a dime a dozen.

Ya know, the next time this is reposted, it'd be nice to see the up/downvotes replaced with green and red candles instead.  At least then it'd make sense.

It's hilarious that you're negging someone about not having the balls to risk a cent while you're bragging about making thousands. THOUSANDS? Hahahaha. How shit do you have to be to have invested in btc for "almost a decade" and only have thousands to show for it?  Keep telling yourself you're a badass investor. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:49:34
No shit.  I've been investing for much longer than you and unlike you I have been exposed to bear markets as well as sideways markets. I cut added tools to my toolbox over the course of time, learning the basics of fundamental analysis, moved on to TA, and honed my skills in both areas of valuation. I still am. And you know what? I didn't and don't mouth off to people who clearly knew more than I did and who understood risk management when they tried to educate me like the guy you were replying to was attempting. 
You may feel like you've got your big boy pants on now,  because we've been in a bull market. The entire global economy has for over 6 years. Your fucking arrogance is based on a false sense of security and ego that you didn't earn by way of skill and risk management, but by chance. You have a long way to go. That's why you're still working a job and have a boss. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 23:29:13
Historically, recessions don’t come every 8-10 years. A correction, sure. And the US economy has been bullish for 8 years now without a large correction rather than the typical 3-4, although an argument can be made that we had a correction in January. 
A recession is much larger than the typical corrective periods following the average 3-4 year bull runs seem historically in the market.
