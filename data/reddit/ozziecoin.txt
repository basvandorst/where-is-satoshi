Example 3
76. A taxpayer owned shares in a public company with a market value of $100,000. The taxpayer's shareholding had been built-up over a period of 5 years and acquired at a cost of $40,000. In acquiring the shares the taxpayer hoped to build up a nest egg for her retirement. The taxpayer sold the shares to her 4 children for $80,000 and used the proceeds in purchasing a unit in a retirement home.
77. The profit made is not income. The transaction was not business or commercial in character. The sale of the shares below their market price and the fact that the purchasers are family of the taxpayer indicate that the transaction was essentially a family dealing.
Example 4
78. Mr Goldfinger purchased a number of gold bars for $100,000 and, following a sharp rise in the price of gold, sold the gold bars one week later for $110,000. Goldfinger did not carry on a business and had no previous dealings in gold.
79. The profit of $10,000 is income and assessable under subsection 25(1). It can be inferred from the objective circumstances (especially the quick sale following a rise in price and the fact that the asset had no immediate use other than as an object of trade) that profit-making was a significant purpose of Goldfinger in acquiring the gold bars. Furthermore, the substantial amounts of money involved and the nature of the asset traded lead to the conclusion that the transaction was commercial in nature.

The Fed buys securities from banks. They do not give money to banks. The banking system creates money out of thin air, on the spot, when loans are made.

@_date: 2014-08-25 04:42:15
I was informed by the ATO as to how this would have a bearing on how Btc will be treated for "investment" versus "personal use" reasons. 
There are a lot of things to clear up. The interesting example is Mr Goldfinger. If you buy lots of Btc, speculate on a price rise then sell them - the ATO is saying that this was an investment purpose. 
The position where you buy Btcs, spend some on living expenses and the Btc value rose and in the future you spend more Btcs on living expenses is very unclear at present. I would argue that is a "personal use" reason more than an "investment reason". 
You should write to the ATO to clarify these things before finalising your tax return (assuming you intend to declare your Btc gains).

The fact is fiat was backed by gold up to 1971. It was not fiat that produced growth, it was peace and technological progress.

I half believed Hearn up to that point. I was so disappointed when he mentioned MT Gox and tx malleability. It was like - this guy has zero cred left. The tx malleability issue is more like an exploit, which people are now aware of. 
If someone had no idea what tx malleability actually is, I think they would walk away worried about bitcoin after reading the article. So, from that perspective, yeah, I call FUD. It was a pretty sneaky FUD move from Hearn. Not sure, what his agenda is but it doesn't feel good.

Well, if they paid out some profits (or even all of it in Btc) then there would be no need to instantly convert Btc to USD. 
It's a win-win. Overstock wins because it does not need to convert to fiat. Shareholders win because they get a chance to diversify their portfolios into Btc.

Wow, re: banks. Do you realise they speculate with deposit funds? That is the whole point of the Volcker rule: to separate risky activities from savings banks.  Moreover, we are talking about PROFITS in the case of bitcoin companies. Existing banks are using the money of DEPOSITORS to make active bets. See JP Morgan. Companies should be free to do whatever they want with their profits. It's called capitalism.
Economists are a cancer to society. These know it all prescribe debt levels that enslave people and worsen inequality. Who put those clowns in charge? I don't see the US reaching escape velocity - ever. Greenspan was an idiot. So was Bernanke. Yellen is continuing the tradition. 
The point is - human beings cannot be trusted. They will inflate the money supply. The US dollar is a prime example of the banking system creating excess money that is pumped into properties via FRB. It's an inherently inequitable system. Economist are those financial high priests that enable banks to issue high debt loads to ordinary people. Enough with economists.

Unfortunately no. Reason being that Btc block reward must be split. Difficult to get consensus on that from miners and especially pools, as stratum must be modified. Also, how much in Btc is required to set a masternode, no consensus on that. But mostly because Gavin is opposed to anonymity. So is Hearn, who favours stealth addresses and limited privacy.

Capitalism isn't about the rich getting wealthier. Capitalism before the 80's worked just fine. Creditism is killing capitalism today.

Their assets increase of their own accord.

This is not about unemployment per se, but also inequality. 
NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Over the past 40 years, those at the top of the money food chain have seen their wealth grow at a rate far outpacing everyone else, according to a new analysis released by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group.
In the early 1960s, the top 1 percent of households in terms of net worth held 125 times the median wealth in the United States. Today, that gap has grown to 190 times.
The top 20 percent of wealth-holding households, meanwhile, held 15 times the overall median wealth in the early 1960s. By 2004, that gap had grown to 23 times.
"In 21st century America, wealth begets wealth, and those without wealth find it farther out of reach," the report's authors write.

The point being that not all supply inputs are denominated in fiat. Overstock understands that it can pay employee bonuses in Btc, which it does. Other companies can adopt the same stance. Also, companies can choose to retain Btc to distribute profits in Btc amounts. There is no fiat cost to paying out profits in Btc.

The part of the BitLicense draft that has the Bitcoin community up in arms can be found in section 200.2n5. That section of the document states, “Virtual Currency Business Activity means the conduct of…controlling, administering, or issuing a Virtual Currency.” The real question is whether or not creating a decentralized cryptocurrency can really be called “issuing” a virtual currency. After all, the reality of the situation is that there is no one issuer of bitcoins on the Bitcoin network. If you had to narrow down the entity that was actually issuing new bitcoins, you could really only point at the Bitcoin source code. Having said that, Satoshi did, in fact, release the source code to the general public back in 2009. The Merriam-Webster definition of issue is “the act of officially making something available or giving something to people to be used.” Under this definition, it would seem that Satoshi would be breaking the law if he did not apply for a BitLicense within the next 45 days. I’ve reached out to Ben Lawsky and the NYDFS to clarify this point, and I am awaiting their response. I am hoping for the sake of the NYDFS’s sanity that they don’t actually think creators of open source software should have to apply for a license.

Other comments on TR92/3:
The Ruling indicates that the following factors are key to making a determination on the 
revenue/ capital point: 
• the nature of the entity undertaking the operation or transaction; 
• the nature and scale of other activities undertaken by the taxpayer; 
• the amount of money involved in the operation or transaction and the magnitude of the 
profit sought or obtained; 
• the nature, scale and complexity of the operation or transaction; 
• the manner in which the operation or transaction was entered into or carried out; 
• the nature of any connection between the relevant taxpayer and any other party to the 
operation or transaction; 
• if the transaction involves the acquisition and disposal of property, the nature of that 
property; and 
• the timing of the transaction or the various steps in the transaction.

"The regulator also said 13 individuals will leave the bank as part of the settlement, including chief operating officer Georges Chodron de Courcel.

In the US: 
The proceeds of most bank loans are not, however, in the form of currency (central bank money). In the United States, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago has stated:
Of course, they [commercial banks] do not really make loans out of the money they receive as deposits. If they did this, they would be acting just like financial intermediaries and no additional money would be created. What they do when they make loans is to accept promissory notes in exchange for credits they make to the borrowers' deposit accounts. Loans (assets) and deposits (liabilities) both rise....
The American Bankers Association has also stated that most bank loans are made not by doling out paper currency and coin, but instead by creating or increasing deposit liabilities owed by the bank:
Typically, bank loans are made to existing customers, or the proceeds of a loan are used to open an account; thus, most bank loans increase total deposits. In the typical credit situation, two balance sheet items --loans and deposits -- are simultaneously increased.

The trust sector is not just any "trust". It's the second largest finance sector in China (behind only the banks) hiding an unimaginably large amount of bad debts.

These entities funded the empty malls and huge swathes of ghost cities that you see in China today.

I think China has already been expanding its money supply. They cannot offload their USD because these USDs have Chinese liabilities on the other side. I.e. exporters earn USD and swap back and forth into RMB. Those reserves are effectively the savings of export companies. 
They don't need to sell USD to bailout their banks, they can print up fresh RMB, which they have actually been doing, and give it to their banks.
Shadow banking over past few years was about half of total social financing. It didn't exist in 2007. The Chinese has lent out a lot of money over the past few years:

Banks create money out of thin air via FRB, which is injected into the housing market. If this process stops, the banking system stops creating new money, which spells recession and deflation.  Deflation then becomes a negative feedback loop, because house prices would fall, less people will take on new mortgages etc... Until the system ends up with only base money left, what economists call M0, which is what the central banks printed up as notes and coins in the first place. 
If we did not have the FRB layer at all, deflationary money would be excellent. We would not have to continually create new money via credit issuances. Ordinary people's lives would improve because all productive and technological advances would be expressed as an increase in the value of money. Lending and borrowing could still continue but on a full reserve basis and not a fractional reserve basis. 
Therefore, deflation is only bad in a FRB credit money model.

Argentina is like the killer use case for converting to bitcoins right? I mean, people can't move pesos or USD out of the country so bitcoins would be ideal. Btc would surely easily beat inflation on the pesos. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 02:43:43
No worries. I think the USD are "spoken for" and can't be sold. They belong to the export companies, that earned them in the first place.  I suppose the Chinese government can always override these companies but in most cases these companies belong to Government. 
The reasons for not selling are several:
1. Foreign investments into China add up to quite a lot of the USD reserve amounts. If they pull out, China can pay them out. 
2. Selling USDs will flood the market with USDs, devaluing the dollar and their own asset. In effect, China can buy less iron ore and energy with a devalued USD. 
3. There is no need to sell off USDs to rescue the banking sector because all internal loans are denominated in RMB. They can just print more of the stuff up. 
The reasons why China might want to sell the USD in future is if oil and iron ore contracts can be paid for in another currency. Maybe some combination of Euros, Roubles and RMB.  China prefers the latter of course. So, the world is slowly de-dollarising.  As the process accelerates, there could be a "first out the door" effect. Who knows, maybe Btc might be in the mix somewhere in some small minor way. But if that process starts, it could accelerate.

GDP growth does not help everyone. The US is a good example of GDP growth making asset holders wealthier at the expense of the middle class and the very poor.  Japan did go into debt but that public debt helped private households clear their own debts. The so called lost decade is not the catastrophe that people think it is. People had jobs, food, shelter and they got out of debt. Japan was forced to create non bank debt based money. If anything, they didn't create enough of it. That's it. The US will soon be crossing that bridge also. The debt based system is coming to an end. Check this video out when you have time:

Brilliant explanation of what money actually is. It is simply a ledger system to keep track of debts. Value is derived from how many people use that ledger. Of course this implies that early adopters of the bitcoin ledger stand to profit greatly if the world transitions to using bitcoin over the next few years. Perhaps, this is an important reason why people should invest a tiny portion of their portfolio into bitcoin, on the off chance that bitcoin does become THE global ledger.

Shrem did not sell bitcoins to Btcking. He sold Btc vouchers to this guy who then sold it on to others who then went to Mt Gox to redeem those vouchers for Btc. Some of that Btc may or may not have been used for buying drugs. They got Shrem on failing to submit transaction reports, which the banks are also guilty of when they laundered money for Mexican drug lords, which most people would agree is a problem that is several magnitudes larger than kids buying weed online.

Yeah, I think some of the big Chinese players might have been very aggressive with borrowing trust monies and funnelling it into highly speculative investments like Btc.

42. For example, if a taxpayer acquires an asset with the intention of using it for personal enjoyment but later decides to venture or commit the asset either:
 as the capital of a business; or
 into a profit-making undertaking or scheme with the characteristics of a business operation or commercial transaction,
the activity of the taxpayer constitutes the carrying on of a business or a business operation or commercial transaction carrying out a profit-making scheme, as the case may be. The profit from the activity is income although the taxpayer did not have the purpose of profit-making at the time of acquiring the asset.

On internet retailing: M-Pesa can work fine with bitcoin. 
Tax free retirement: I'm well advised on this in Australia. 
Asset diversification: price volatility is smoothed out by using 5 to 7 year investment horizons. Also, measure bitcoin price once a year. 
Argentinians: You do realise that Argentina is not the only country in this situation? Moreover, the economy of Argentina is huge relative to the market cap of bitcoin. 
Instantly send money: Now that I CAN send money instantly why would I want to go back to something slower and not 24 hours. It's illogical. It would be like me using Encyclopaedias when the Internet and Wikipedia exists. 
More people are joining: Of course they are. This time last year the attitude of Russia and China was unclear. Now, it has been established that bitcoin is legal. Even in Thailand, the Govt is accepting of bitcoin. A new Thai exchange was recently created. 
Bitcoin is getting closer to mainstream: Older people will struggle no doubt. But their children will find bitcoin easy to use. You are trying to measure adoption over a period of months. Once I looked at bitcoin from a 3 to 5 year perspective, I can't see people going back once they have tried bitcoin.

Totally agree with you that this is a human problem. But the effect is pretty much the same:
Counterfeiting real paper dollars is illegal. However, the banking system creates "counterfeit" dollars via debt everyday - a kind of offchain transaction if you will. When someone takes a loan: debt increases and money is created out of thin air. 
When someone buys Btc in an offchain transaction, money is received and Btc is effectively created out of thin air.  Real Btc does not need to be delivered until that person tries to move their Btc from the exchange to their own wallet.

You are right: Should read the cost of the bitcoins, with an "s". Makes no difference in the end. As under either interpretation, CGT does NOT apply for personal consumption. 
Edit: If you want to be cheeky, you can try to spend $200,000 in bitcoins having a cost of say $20,000 and try to argue that each bitcoin was less than $10,000.  Don't think you'd get very far though. :)

Here is the US version: 
And the Fed has said the same thing. For example, a 1960s Chicago Federal Reserve Bank booklet entitled “Modern Money Mechanics” said:
[Banks] do not really pay out loans from the money they receive as deposits. If they did this, no additional money would be created. What they do when they make loans is to accept promissory notes in exchange for credits to the borrowers’ transaction accounts.
William C. Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech in July 2009:
Based on how monetary policy has been conducted for several decades, banks have always had the ability to expand credit whenever they like. They don’t need a pile of “dry tinder” in the form of excess reserves to do so. That is because the Federal Reserve has committed itself to supply sufficient reserves to keep the fed funds rate at its target. If banks want to expand credit and that drives up the demand for reserves, the Fed automatically meets that demand in its conduct of monetary policy. In terms of the ability to expand credit rapidly, it makes no difference.

Three barriers to bitcoin adoption of decentralised coinjoin:
1. The dev team is heading away from anonymity, not towards it.

Looks like there is a distinction between investment and personal use reasons: 
18. This Draft Tax Determination is not intended to define the circumstances in which Bitcoin would be a personal use asset. Bitcoin is not kept or used for personal enjoyment. Bitcoin that is kept or used mainly for the purpose of profit-making or investment, or to facilitate purchases or sales in the course of carrying on business is not used or kept mainly for personal use. Bitcoin that is kept or used mainly to make purchases of items for personal use or consumption ordinarily will be kept or used mainly for personal use. Other categories of use conceivably could exist; taxpayers in these cases should seek private rulings.

Well, one is legal the other is illegal. If you intend to migrate, bitcoin is better. Also, if you are talking about larger sums like over $50,000; bitcoin is better. To get bitcoins, check localbitcoins in your area. To secure them, use a trezor device or blockchain.info. Write down your passwords on a piece of paper and store it in a bank safe deposit box away from your trezor. Relative to the peso, bitcoin is an absolute safe investment with potentially very large upsides.

Foreign owned companies can always withdraw at the prevailing rate. There is no official "right" per se. However, if the CNY was dropping versus the USD, that would accelerate flight of foreign investment from China. This actually happened last year when US banks started pulling out of China. Soothing words were said and foreign investment did not pull out, AFAIK. 
Point 1 above, was the reason why Asian countries experienced meltdowns in the Asian Financial Crisis and more recently when capital flight was triggered by Bernanke announcing taper last year. Each country needs sufficient reserves in case foreign investment tries to pull out. 
If China sold USD, they would get RMB, which is just as worthless. China is buying USD to maintain FX and will continue to do so while oil and iron ore are denominated in USD. 
Btc is far too small now but if just one sovereignty experimented with it, it will blast off and become big enough almost immediately. Not saying it's going to happen soon but all the mechanics are in place and Btc is definitely better than SDR notes. 
The Chinese "banking" crash has already started. Not in the official sector but in the Ponzi shadow banking sector. They do not have sufficient growth to maintain the Ponzi. Even if the Chinese government guaranteed all the bad trust loans, that sector can't grow anymore because return on investments in China is near zero. 
Yes, agree with you on China turning into Japan. US and Europe also. There is no other way.  US efforts to reach escape velocity has failed after three rounds of QE. Flak on Fed Reserve too much now. This is probably the end of asset price growth anywhere in the world. Maybe with the exception of Africa. We shall see.

If a country adopted bitcoin as a national currency first, they would have first mover advantage. They would have gotten bitcoins cheaper than other nations. The only thing they then need to do is to encourage adoption around the world. The first country would then become wealthy.

Just attended his talk tonight. So much misleading info.
1. Claimed that bitcoin requires 10 minutes to verify a restaurant transaction.
2. Claimed that bitcoin is uncorrelated to other assets which makes it risky and that it represented "pure risk" in a portfolio.
3. Claimed that bitcoin daily volatility is increasing over time. 
4. Claimed that a deflationary currency like bitcoin was not suitable for the economy.
Overall, presented a very one sided, unbalanced view of bitcoin under the guise of academia. It was an extremely one sided lecture. I would say almost worthless other than the fact that it highlighted to me that these guys are worried about the growth of bitcoin around the world. Don't expect a fair presentation from David.
