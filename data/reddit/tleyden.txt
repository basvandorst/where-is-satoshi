Ok, that's what I was looking to understand!  A fraudster would *never* take that gamble if the chances are so low.
@_date: 2016-04-27 21:38:40
I dunno, I've never tried that!  Do I get to keep the Rolex? :-D  Seems like there must be some "catch", like my CC rating will go down or something .. sounds too good to be true.
@_date: 2016-04-28 02:50:22
Yeah, not only *that* picture, but *all* my pictures!  And all my bitcoins too!  People holding guns to people's heads seriously suck.
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:12:41
Good point, but someone can always fake their personal details.  It's not hard to get a fake ID.  So if I hand over my art piece and end up with 0 BTC and a fake ID, I have absolutely no recourse.
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:16:14
Ah, ok that makes sense, thanks!  Still curious about why don't think checking  has any value though?
According to Andreas Antonopoulos "It would take a deliberate double-spend by the sender to reverse it and that would only work if there was a fork event"

Well I searched for "ios app bitcoin lightning network" on Google and "bitcoin lightning" on the iOS App Store and nothing has jumped out at me.  Do you know any mobile apps that support it today?
@_date: 2016-04-28 02:40:28
Good point!  Does Coinbase have any sort of transaction limit on BTC transfers?  I guess as a vendor, I could just have all sorts of wallets like Coinbase, Circle, etc, and offer "lightning speed" transactions by just having them send to the fastest wallet address.
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:36:59
Right, makes sense.  Which kinda makes me think that some sort of lightweight "credit rating" system would make sense.  Like an app where I could take a photo of their ID and/or credit card, and it would spit back a countdown timer how long they'll have to sit their and twiddle their thumbs before they can walk out the door with my art piece.  
Does something like that already exist?
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:02:58
Great comments, but I'm still not clear on how a double-spender could game the system of there was a confirmation .. or would they have to get "lucky" for their double-spend to actually work?  What are their chances of pulling this off?
@_date: 2016-04-28 02:43:29
Also, as far as being assured that a transaction will be included in the next block, if I'm understanding  correctly, then it seems like as long as I include a high enough transaction fee (say 151 Satoshis/byte), my transaction *should* get included in the next block.
@_date: 2016-04-27 19:43:17
I agree and disagree.  I think I could walk into Tiffany's and after pointing to a Rolex and saying "I want that", I could probably hand them my credit card and walk out the door in less than 10 minutes.  
I think the holdup with buying the car is more about the paperwork.
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:03:29
"No not really" &lt;-- can you elaborate on that?
@_date: 2016-04-28 02:45:12
I feel like there must be *a lot* more than just "customers being honest" that's holding people back from buying something, getting the credit card transaction reversed, and just keeping the item.
@_date: 2016-04-27 23:03:13
Yeah, I think that's a pragmatic approach.  Still kinda confused on how long 1 confirmation takes "on average" though.  Although another person suggested bumping the transaction fee higher to speed it up.  Just wondering if I could "reliably" get that under 10 minutes.  
@_date: 2016-04-28 02:38:05
But if there is one confirm, even if it's on a fork that ends up losing, it seems like it's *extremely* difficult and unlikely for a fraudster to successfully mount a "double spend" attack and get the painting for free.  (see jani8x's comments about "Chances are close to zero")
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:09:22
"But confirmations don't come every ten minutes" &lt;-- actually, can you elaborate on that too? 
I thought that my transaction was guaranteed to be in the next block,  but I take it you are saying that it might be a few blocks before my transaction gets included in a block?  
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:51:31
Ok, maybe it's not useful for the sake of validating transactions, but for curiosity's sake .. how does it work?  If I wanted to create my own method for detecting double-spends and not rely on blockchain.info, how would I do it?
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:31:26
Interesting!  Can that double-spend information be gotten directly from the blockchain?  Or from a more reliable provider?
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:01:34
Regarding credit cards and checks, if a customer tries to reverse the charges then I will start a legal dispute with the credit card or bank.  Basically, I will have legal recourse.
Regarding taking their name and address, if someone was intentionally try to defraud me they might just give me fake information.  
Or, they might abort the transaction, which would be a good thing,   and so that's probably a good way to mitigate risk in an in-store BTC transaction: I could take a picture of their drivers license and credit card, which might give me some legal recourse .. albeit a bit more work required to track them down, especially if they were a tourist from another country.
@_date: 2016-04-27 23:14:04
Wow, that's awesome!  So could I sum it up as ..
1) if I throw in a "hefty" transaction fee of 151 Satoshis/byte, I'm basically guaranteed to get my transaction into the next block?  
2) that block will happen in 10-20 minutes approximately 80% of the time?  
@_date: 2016-04-27 16:54:08
Yeah, not a bad point actually!  And then I could offer them a glass of wine (or two!) and start selling them more art.
@_date: 2016-04-27 19:47:13
I've heard good things about the Lightning network!  But, won't that mean that my customer will have to have a "Lightning network enabled app"?  (if those even exist yet?)
@_date: 2016-04-27 19:46:09
Yeah I wouldn't count on zero confirmation, I was thinking more about waiting for a single confirmation.  I had thought that would happen within 10 minutes .. but according to other posters it can be up to 3 hours!  
Are there any reliable statistics anywhere about how long transactions take to get confirmations?
@_date: 2016-04-27 21:47:02
Ok that's really good to know.  Do you have any numbers to clarify what "in no time" means?  I mean, I'm assuming the "normal" transaction fee is on the order of a fraction of a penny right? (sorry to use USD currency, too lazy to think about things in terms of microbits).  So if I offered a transaction fee of 10 cents, is there a 99% chance my transaction would get confirmed within 10 minutes?  Or more like 75%?  Or is it too random to predict?
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:03:44
It's broken because the publisher pulled it.  I was wondering if anyone knew why.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:02:33
A friend just sent me this article, which has since been pulled so I didn't get a chance to read it.  It apparently detailed a way for the coins from the "value overflow incident" (  to be revived / re-instated in an attack against the blockchain.   
This seems difficult / impossible without rewinding back to block 74691, so is there really anything to it?  Or was the article pulled due to being nonsense?
@_date: 2016-06-08 18:47:14
I think you might be coming at it from the perspective of someone who wants to remain anonymous, but what about the opposite scenario where someone wants to be as transparent as possible?  
For example a non-profit organization who wants to show that they spent all their money buying toilet paper on Overstock.com as opposed to using it on a gambling website?
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:36:24
It would be great if it supported some of the more popular altcoins too
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:33:17
Baseline worked for me, although I think the app could use some improvements.
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:28:25
Agree 100%.  I edited my original post with a link to that.
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:27:42
Ugh, **facepalm**.  Yes, I meant "victim".  Thanks, I just updated my comment!

I mean, one could argue there is a benefit to him personally for getting as much media coverage as he did today, but when I read the quote in the Wired article where he says “Maybe he wants things to be really weird and unclear, which would be bad for me.”, it's pretty clear that he feels being wrong would about this would outweigh any positive benefits of media coverage he got. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:02:24
Yeah, I gotta agree .. I think Gavin was the victim of a ridiculously elaborate scam!  I added some edits to that effect.
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:00:36
Yeah, you're totally right!  I realized that after reading the wired article and added some edits to my original post.  Gavin seems like he may have had good intentions, but ended up getting completely scammed.  I feel bad for him!
