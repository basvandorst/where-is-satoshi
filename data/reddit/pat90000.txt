I've found that swing trading works best for me. I think day trading is good but only if you have a lot of capital. If you can scalp 1% with 1 mil in a day, then you're set.
I haven't done as much research as you claim but I do know that bitcoin and Blockchain, specifically Blockchain, is the future. The 10 yr stretch of Bitcoin is undeniably important.
I would say the best way to invest now is to create uses for Bitcoin and crypto to push decentralization. We are hitting this 9 to 10k barrier because there are not enough practical uses for crypto.
If we invest our time into creating payment processors that allow us to pay in bitcoin and things of that nature, it will increase our crypto investments and even business ventures 10 fold.

24 here. I did something similar to this fall 2018 when I was 23. I basically sold everything and lived on my money for a year and tried to daytrade after reading Rich Dad, Poor Dad.
Made 2k in 5 minutes in virginia beach while watching the ocean. 
Lost 2k next day lmao but dude it was the BEST year of my life in terms of freedom. Lot of stress and I'm working my way up from broke now because all my business ideas and day trading flopped. 
I'm gearing up to do it again. Good luck, its gonna be a hell of a fun ride.

The problem with crypto is you cant use it and explaining it to your grandma is impossible. 
It will take many more years for this to begin to reach its potential.

I agree, sweet monies lol. 
If you're smart, you'll lead the viewers onto something you own like a website or email list. 
The problem is they are working for YouTube. They are building youtube up and unbeknownst to the content creator, they are inadvertently an employee of youtube. 
Aaaaaand youtube can fire you at anytime!

Assuming I get the truck instantly, the Cybertruck.
I would drive the truck around for memes for a few weeks.
Then, I would sell the Cybertruck for 1million dollars because they arent even going to be released for 1 to 2 more years. 
I'd invest 100k in AMD. 100k in Msft. 100k in Bitcoin. 100k in an REIT.
Immediately buy 2 50,000 onlike businesses that need some work and fix them up.
I take 100k of that money and pay myself a salary for 1 year, leaving 400k.
I pull out 100k in cash and slap it in a safe in my house made of titanium.
I'd take the remaining 300k and set it aside for insurance for my businesses until they get off the ground.
