Your ISP assigns you your ip address based on the MAC address of the device that connects to your modem. If you want to change your IP to something else than just change your MAC address in your router settings (assuming you have cable internet and a router that allows you to change your MAC address).

Agreed. It costs them more for electricity. They should just donate money.

Regardless, the US dollar is backed by the government -- BTC on the other hand, not so much.

Not BTCs if someone rips you off you lose money. Most money transfered in us is reversible and accountable for. Look at all the Btc services that stole money from people: mtgox got hacked, mybitcoin, bitconia ..etc

I am going against the hive here but here is my view on where BTC is going to go. Bitcoin will not grow much because economic growth in BTC causes deflation --- there is no regulation to match the usage of currency to the value-- this leads to mass hoarding and heavy price fluctuations. Bitcoin will not become nothing more than a niche currency for speculators and illegal money trade. 
A large basis behind my reasoning is that BTC requires trust --- and when charge backs are not possible and the currency is unregulated you cannot have trust -- there is just not that security -- anything in BTC that becomes succesful becomes corrupt or has security issues or both. Good luck there being a solution to this.

Canadian banks are actually fairly stable
unlike American ones. What are you referring to in particular?

So you paid some whores off, big deal. Anyone with a few hundred dollars can do that.

Do these Butterfly Labs exist? I have yet to see anybody review it anywhere. Seems like a scam to me.

Care to provide a link, I looked a bit -- found nothing.

Uh, you have to go through at least that many steps to acquire bitcoins in the first place. Something more fair would be to say that I already have a registered paypal account. I enter my username/password, select the amount to donate, click submit, click confirm and I'm done.
Your example isn't a very good one.

Ya but this is the opposite situation. Due to inflation -- we are encouraged to spend to avoid losing value. A currency that deflates promotes the opposite -- hoarding.
@_date: 2013-02-13 21:11:47
As great as having the currency raise in value might sounds... its actually terrible.
A good currency remains stable along with inflation. Why sell bitcoins when they will be worth more tommorrow? Why lend money in bitcoins if bitcoins will be worth more significantly more tommorrow.

There is no added value -- except for being prepackaged and hence saving a few hours.

I could do it in 20 minutes, but someone else with little to no linux experience will likely have trouble getting it to work.

Thank you for putting into worlds what I have been thinking about Bitcoin. If only everyone in the world would get a coin for themselves. The severely uneven distribution of the currency is what puts me away from it.
@_date: 2013-02-19 23:01:52
Not really. A bitcoin2 could replace it.
