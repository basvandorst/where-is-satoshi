I see. Skimmed the research paper but didn't find anything regarding usage of ZKP. It's quite possible I skimmed badly. Mind pointing me in the right direction? I must admit the possibility of using a ZKP intrigues me.

This sums up the at first seemingly easy solutions well, and their significant downsides. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 16:30:07
No, your proposal has a serious flaw: It would be trivial to buy votes. 
Electronic voting systems are well researched, and their difficulties are many enough to make existing implementations horrible and, at present, a terrible idea. 
Three of the criteria a voting system needs to fulfill (in the context of a modern democracy) that make things extremely difficult:
 - Anonymity
 - Votes should be verifiable, but only by the voter, not by a third party (prevents vote trading)
 - Vote counting must be done in a secure manner (this is where most modern implementations of E-voting fails)
These are just some of the more well defined criteria written about in the literature. For more info about the most ambitious (but still horribly flawed) attempts at implementing E-filing so far: look up the systems in Estonia and Switzerland. 
I urge you not to dismiss this as easy.

In democracies, having verifiable/provable votes is something you can't have as it makes vote buying easy.
Votes should only be verifiable by the voter, the voter should not be able to prove to a third party what he/she voted for. This is why votes are put in ballot boxes on public display, and why the votes are counted in public at each polling station.

I doubt it, there are no reasonably good features to train a model on that I can come up with.

I'd say that's the case for any secure blockchain ledger, not only Bitcoin. Still on the fence about calling it [*intrinsic*]( as there are [different meanings of the word](

Within most of the EU direct debit transfers are free (not only domestic).
@_date: 2016-05-21 16:31:36
And how long does those transfers take? 
Card purchases are not free from fees either, it's just that it's the receiver that pays and not the customer. It should be added that the fees are pretty nasty and often (always?) include a fraction of the total amount on top of a fixed fee.

This bus could always be full if it was free regardless of size (or cheap relative to size) due to malevolent actors. Charging people according to what the market thinks a transaction is worth is necessary, regardless of block size.
@_date: 2016-05-21 16:30:00


I'm not saying anyone is, I'm merely explaining that we need to pay something and charging people more is the solution to fit more non-malevolent transactions on the blockchain when the price is too low. I'm not arguing the transaction fee should be higher than it is either, only pointing out that the original "Such logic" statement is a failed attempt at irony since in practice more non-malevolent transactions would fit in each block if the price was increased to the point where malevolent transactions could no longer be created en masse.
Not sure how anything I said has anything to do with central planning.

Actually Israel was created by the British. 


So, Brits got control of the area. 


Brits granted mandate by the League of Nations (precursor to what is today the UN).

I'm not sure what weird country you're in if it works the way you claim. In the country I live in (Sweden) I can confidently say that cheating the system is non-trivial and the method you describe wouldn't work (voters are identified and there are checks that make it impossible to vote twice, even at different booths). I could explain to you more in depth how the protection works, but I doubt it would matter much to this discussion. If you have doubts or are otherwise legitimately interested, let me know.
Both the buying and selling of votes is illegal (for good reason). In order to effectively be able to buy votes at the booths the buyer would have to physically be there and verify that the vote is indeed cast for the option the buyer is paying for (making the method of buying votes at the booths impossible to scale and therefore impractical). 
If a vote could be verified publicly (without disclosing your identity) then that would make the existing system break down since the buyer could effectively pay someone in whatever untraceable method they wish once verified.
I apparently am not making a convincing argument. I'll just end with the fact that you should take seriously the research that is going into solving this problem (solutions exist that offer compromises, but nothing fit for use in critical applications such as elections in democracies) as well as the research that analyzes the weaknesses of existing e-voting systems. From having analyzed the literature thoroughly roughly a year ago I can summarize the current status for you: We don't know how to do it as good as the current low-tech system that is in place in most mature democracies.

From what I've heard from my friend who likes number theory a lot more than I do: It is believed that he had a proof, but it is ~~likely~~ *almost certain* to have been wrong.  
Will see if I can find a reference.
Edit: It's possible he had a proof that was wrong. [But we just don't know.](

It's just a mantra repeated by a lot of people who don't have much understanding for what would actually make a *good* application of blockchain tech. It is a hard problem, as someone has stated before: Ethereum is a solution in search of a problem ("killer apps" if you will) 
Blockchains *can* be used for a lot of things, but that doesn't mean that it *should* be unless it improves upon current solutions. I don't doubt people will find good applications, it's just that very few have proven themselves to be better than alternative solutions so far. 
Basically, saying it has a lot of applications might be factually true (there is potential) but good ones are still few and far in between. We'll have to wait and see which applications survive and which perish.   
@_date: 2016-07-01 06:23:01
I know very well how blockchain tech works. What I have doubts about is how you plan to make a verifiable voting system without the critical flaws of virtually all other electronic voting systems. See my other comments in the thread for a brief summary of the flaws mentioned.
Edit: and please stop linking your startup in your other comments around reddit as if it was someone else's. No need to hide the fact, and definitely no need to do it poorly. (At least we share a love for Ocarina of Time &lt;3)

I have not made any proposal to define some transactions as malevolent. What I describe is how Bitcoin currently works. The fee market is there, it's how transactions compete for inclusion in a block. I think we are saying the same thing with different words, perhaps I have been unclear.


I have never said they shouldn't be included if they can pay the tx fee. When I say malevolent transactions I refer to transactions in a [flood attack]( Transaction fees effectively make such attacks a waste of resources (unless there is some extremely profitable reason to disrupt the chain temporarily that I'm not seeing), nothing else is needed.


Again, I haven't argued for any intervention at all and I've never claimed there is something wrong with Bitcoin when it comes to this issue. I'm really not sure what we disagree about.
All I've argued for is the need for transaction fees that aren't cheap enough to make flood attacks profitable somehow.
On a related note: Increasing the block size (suddenly) is a significant intervention precisely because it would in effect temporarily reduce transaction fees until demand for transactions has caught up. Changing the block size might still be prudent, but at current tx costs I don't see why.
