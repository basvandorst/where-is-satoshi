Boycott bitpay, it's a bch shill
They can also choose to include or exclude transactions by making you pay to these weird addresses.
Allowing them to set the mining fee to whatever they want to make using bch seems better

By USD millionaires does it mean people who live in the US?
I find it hard to belive that 1 in a 100 people are millionaires in the US

Anyone planning to travel to Russia for the world cup most likely has already booked a flight flight and hotel online that is paid for 
If they haven't I doubt there will be any free rooms

Ya on a whim during the profit times of January, I was researching cars and decided that if I were to get a car it would be a model s or the new roadster

I think he is pretty funny, I think this segmet was boring because 
1. Blockchain isnt that funny
2. We are literate on this subject so the jokes about it being confusing were not relevent
3. We all already knew about stuff like Bitconnect, FUD, hodl (I guess 3 is like 2)

Probably related to sites such as coinbase adopting batching

Just because he didn't include coins in your bag doesnt mean this isn't a cool idea
You have my upvote

See that's how people should get into bitcoin, as a use cause. It wasn't until early 2017 did I even consider holding bitcoin as an investment
Do I sometimes look back at every multi bitcoin transaction I sent and wonder what if, sure, but I thank my lucky stars that I was involved that early

But according to xe.com 1 usd is worth 361 Zimbabwean dollars

We will never hit 21 million bitcoin
It is mathematically impossible

I know I sound like a record player but store the coins yourself whether on your computer or better yet a hardware wallet, as for a private exchange any decentralized exchange should work but they lack liquidity sometimes

Have you read digital gold by Nathaniel poppers?
If so are the books similar?
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:54:24
And the other 73% would choose altcoins

I invested in bitcoin when I was 12
But yes I see your point 
@_date: 2018-04-03 06:38:42
Well I was buying social media followers and servers

In this utopian world how are these kids with no credit cards or bank accounts getting their crypto?
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:10:26
Simple, I wanted to buy things online and that's all people accepted
In fact after searching the term bitcoin in my email showed me that I would message people on Ebay if they would like to buy my clash of clans accounts for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-23 21:16:46
Didn't this just come out?
@_date: 2018-04-26 07:14:50
The 21st millionth bitcoin will mathematically never be mined

What type of graph is that, it goes from 10 to 600 then to 10k
