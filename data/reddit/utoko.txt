also not on the trade. If a short goes your way and you take out way more than you initial leverage let a bit in and it gets liquidated. It was still highly successful trade. Even if at the end it says you got liquidated.

Crypto market is way too entangled . You want to diverse your portfolio to limit your exposure of any type of asset.
Since every single altcoin drops together with bitcoin the argument doesn't hold up.
If you want to diversify put some in bitcoin, some in stocks, some real estate.
The same way you don't put money in audi, VW and BMW and say it is because it is important to have a diverse portfolio it just doesn't make sense.

You are thinking small if you know the future go in 50x short from 20k to 4k. If you reinvest your gains on the way down again with 50x. He could easy get to 1000x in the time.
but out of principal he choose to not make 1000 bitcoins out of his 1 bitcoin even tho he knew the future.
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:15:28
liquidated just means that your leverage isn't enough. 
Many traders take in a successful trade enough out to break even and let the rest ride a bit longer.
There are also people who short to hedge their long position. These also come out pretty much even. 
Just 2 examples out of many how you can easy gain overall at the same time you get liquidated.

What you mean with "facts"? You can look up people on trading platforms and look at what trades they did if they have public profile. 
You can find very successful people in 2018 bear market. 
If it was luck or "skill" is debatable ofc. The same way you can't proof that you making money in a bull market is not just luck.  
You can make points all day why bitcoin is likely to go up but there is no single fact that bitcoin will go up 100%.
@_date: 2019-07-28 09:36:55
If you don't have the majority in the network which agrees with the changes it doesn't matter what the devs do.
At best they can do a hard fork but without support you have a new worthless version of bitcoin than. 
The important point is that not a small number of people can just make changes and control it.
There are at least 40 forks of bitcoin. How many can you name?

there are no shorters or longers. There are daytraders who short when the trend is bearish and long when the trend is bullish.

@_date: 2019-07-01 15:04:07
I made a point that you still lose value even if you don't sell. It matters that the asset you hold has a future. 
It doesn't matter that bitcoin or whatever goes down or up. You need to evaluate the asset from the present. When nothing fundamental changes you don't sell bitcoin or whatever. 
If something important changes you sell and don't be stupid and say the"HODL you can't lose anything when you don't sell" meme.
It is only true in this case because nothing changed for bitcoin everything that pushes bitcoin to all time highs is still in place and gets improved.

ever thought why diversity is good? 
Because you want to reduce risk. So you want to invest in OTHER markets. 
If you think solar energy is the future you also only invest in the best(fundamental analyses) solar company and then diversify into other markets. You think buying stocks from other worse solar companies would reduce your risk a lot?  
You can gamble on small alts with like 1% of your portfolio if you want but that has nothing to do with diversity.

In case of china the stock market is not that close to the whole market as in the US.

5% of GDP is peanuts for the circulating amount. 
The US doubled the circulating amount after 2008 in \~ 5 years. 
also it is only one factor which increases inflation slowly(when everything else is fine). 
If you check out bitcoin you will see that the circulating amount still increases every year quite a bit. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 11:56:18
Depends on how you define best. It is certainly easier to be right with bitcoin and still get very high gains in a bullrun. 
quite a few people have had a much better payday, for example with Ethereum but with alts the HODL strategy is certainly not advisable.  
higher gains come with higher risk simple.
@_date: 2018-09-18 08:59:23

I think it is unlikely there seem to be big buying support around 6k. We got many times to that point now and every time we got big buying support there even when there was strong selling. 
In my opinion there seem to be enough big players who accumulate bitcoins around that price range. Big whales are not interested in the quick buck they are also not interested in pushing the price. They are happy to buy every time the price comes down. So they can get the maximum profit when the next bull runs comes where people FOMO in again.  
TLDR: To answer your question is it possible ? Sure the future isn't set in stone. Is it likely? no
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:23:54
well it only works as long as there are enough sheep to move after you every cycle so you can make profit. and if there are still so much of these people then we will need more time until they are out of the market.

As long as we stay in the bear market for sure. If we get bullish again altcoins will rise again because humans are greedy and with small altcoins are more gains possible not because the altcoins are valuable just because you need less fresh money for high gains.

ye daytraders are trading often in ranges for small profits but daytraders can't hold bitcoin back when real demand is coming in.

the average guy also did never buy any stock shares. You will hear every year people talk about how they could be rich if they invested just a little bit in Apple, Amazon, Bitcoin ... Whatever. But many of these people never try in their life and just give their money to the bank for 3&amp; RoE/yearly . If you start with 18 to manage just putting 20$ away every month to invest. Your chances are good that you will get rich even if BTC doesn't go to 100000$. Just diversify and don't get too greedy.  compound interest is your friend!

I didn't really try to say any trading is gambling. : \)

If you don't have cross margin activated in bitmex each position used only as much margin as the position requires. doesn't matter how much capital is in your account.


I didn't say he was pushing the price \(10 mill is nothing in BTC\) .


What signs? You have no way to know that. I often have 2 positions open on 2 accounts and you get pretty much on \+\- 0&amp; at  liquidation point because you gained in the move the same amount on your other position.

people really don't understand that a whale can't just move in and out of market like a normal guy.
Bill gates has a networt from 91.5 Billion but guess what 95&amp; is in other stocks and the same way he can't just buy 91 billion worth of Bitcoin he can't just sell all his share in other companies in a day.
On every exchange is only so much available at any given time.
So before he even goes into crypto he would crash the other stocks were he has big &amp; in. If he wants to leave very quickly.
after he has done that he pushes BTC like crazy everyone who wants to sell that day can. Not sure how that is "messing with BTC" . That is investing in BTC and pushing the price I can think of worse things.

It depends how he defines people. 
If all People(big investors, miners, institutions... all run by people)  believed it happens exactly that way it would exactly happen that way. Because as soon as you get out of the range people would sell/buy to get it back in since they expect it to go there. 
That the more people thinking something happens makes it less likely to happen makes no sense. Since they are at the end the people who make it happen. 
That being said when a bunch of redditors all think something happens doesn't mean it will happen because they have most likely little to no influence at all.

Just reach the top of the pennant again. With "here" I did mean here in this move. You usually work yourself to the edges and then when you break the pennant you get the strong move\(compared to the moves in the pennant\).

ye these TA people who bring out 10 updates every day are not useful for you if you want to scalp on technicalities. On an 5 minute chart. You have to learn to do it yourself because you hang behind on every trade anyway. If you are in a trade and something happens and there are no updates? Lets just panicsell because I don't know what to do...
Tradingview is quite nice to evaluate people because you can't delete ideas once they are published. So you can check out the complete history and get a picture of what content they produce and how often the calls are close/right.  \(They could ofc create a new account after a while but ye if someone has only a 1\-2 month history then you should be aware of that.\) No one can predict the future with TA. There are points which are hard to call and other points where you can call a move with 80&amp; certainty. 100&amp; is just not in the cards.
You had a high probability to see a trend reversal when btc came down to 15k because we created a lower low with a strong high volume move. At that point you had a high chance that BTC goes down further. There are never guarantees so sometimes you will have the situation where you have to reenter with \~10&amp; missed gains. That is risk management.
Trade the most likely scenario and be prepared for every scenario

sure he could "mess" with it. but unlike many people think for whatever reason you can only short as much as  available to short. and every single short comes back in the market as some point. These massive pricejumps up in 3 minutes are only happening because of that effect.

Real demand is when people buy Bitcoin to use it. 
Even hodl'er are just doing longterm speculation on the BTC price.

Another likely possibility is that all that matters for them are views. and if Bitcoin jumps up FOMO people don't turn in to hear good investment advise to be careful(and stuff like that). They would turn off and find another source which supports them in their emotion driven trading process.
They don't get a % cut when you make money so that has for sure no priority for them .

hindsight 20/20 . If you expect something to crush and burn in the future you don't join it for shortterm gains and if they decide to go with a small amount into something it is more around a billion with the investing company. 
why didn't you buy Bitcoin with everything you had in 2015? even called the bottom gj .  I would buy 2009, sell at 2013, buy 2015 and then sell at dec 2017 again sounds good? 
I think if you handle 500 Billion he can live with missing out on some more million but I guess you wouldn't say no to it.
Most stocks Berkshire invest in they sit for 20 \+ years. 
He also missed out on every tech company google, apple\(ye last year he bought apple when the biggest gains are gone\), amazon, facebook whatever. They are still outperforming the market but Warren Buffets best years are before the year 2000. He gained 40&amp; yearly over 25 years\(I don't make the math for you but if you manage to do that you just need 500$ to be rich when you old\). The consistency was insane and that made him to the richest person on earth for a while.

The good thing is there are always some predictions which still fit in your personal bias. All predictions which fail are easy to forget. If you use google you can already find tons of predictions for the first quarter of the year which failed.
but it is easy to predict something 2\-5 years into the future because you have a long time where it still can be possible.
I am bullish on BTC but all this hard pinpoint numbers are ALL bullshit sry. In the end 2\-3 of these people will be close but let me tell you about broken clocks...

up and downtrend cycles are often about the same time span.   Sure that it is  exactly one month right now is a bit unusual but can be just coincidance.
There are also a lot of people trading with pattern. If people saw that the turning point was 2 month in the row on the 6. it gives them already a decent signal for the 3. month and so on. In a 24/7 worldwide market like BTC many patterns are a lot cleaner. Funny how people always say TA in BTC doesn't work. I always find TA in BTC overall a lot more accurate.
\(TA does help you to identify possible turning points, entry point and good profit targets. TA can't tell you 100&amp; which direction it goes. People often confuse these\)

Sometimes there are not endless other options left. and if he can't buy back in later maybe that will also have reasons.
"Hey buddy remember later that I told you so. You wasted your BTC to buy food and stuff. HODL!! "
and yes you should normally only invest what you can afford to lose but he clearly wrote here that he needs the money.
@_date: 2018-05-04 15:38:54
when you can only have one opinion possible then ye.
Not to mention that the quote isn't even in the article.
There is no reputation the CEO can lose here. It is just a free comment.
a.\) it becomes true it reflex positive on you
b.\) it doesn't become true everyone forgets and moves on to the next prediction.
and in both scenarios he still pushes BTC a bit in the shortterm which is good for him also.
So why is a "100&amp; of the time bullish" comment more worth then a random comment which can be 50&amp; up or 50&amp; down?
only because it sounds better for all us hodlers here.

studies of markets have shown again and again that that the breakpoint 100, 1000, 10000 and co are significant in any market.
logical between 9923 and 10023 is just a small difference  but for your your subconscious makes quite a difference \(at least for the average person if you feel special\) .
You can measure  that by higher tradingvolume,  harder to break and When it breaks\(not just spikes higher\) you often have a 20&amp; \+ rally ...  \(ye BTC is a market on steroids\)
BTC overall broke it quite easy but the trading volume still was higher\(more profit taking around 10k\) and we had a strong rally after.
Even in your supermarket it makes still a difference between 9.99$ and 10.00$. Everyone knows about this "selling trick" but the odd thing is it is works. This got tested again and again.
TLDR: bigger number = scary for our subconscious
@_date: 2018-05-26 10:23:18
ye right 50/50. You know there are more options like a rally to 8k and then down again?

Big market movements have signal effects. So the impact of well placed orders from one entity has more impact . There is always a huge number of people following the price.

ye and we have a steady growth in &amp; of the money supply and a steady inflation.  The amounts get bigger since  \+50&amp; from 10000 is different from \+50&amp; from 100000. The inflation rate was under control the last 90 years. 
Sure a system collapse happens in some point in the future which can be in 2 years or in 100 years. I guess you were prepared for the crash 1950.

Ye maybe 9.5k I mean you can't always tell where the dip ends or if it is dip anyway. and ye If you were able to recognise crash pattern you would have sit out quite a bit of the downmove.

ye it is called testing levels. On strong levels  trader take profit . So it is hard to break on the first try. Just normal marketmoves. 
Sure when you are in a really strong bullrun you can burst though this levels because you will have way more buy than sell pressure. but we just had a 70&amp; crash.  So every strong level should be a slow grind. \(I mean it is only slow grind for crypto market\) . People should relax more. As long as we don't make a new lower local low which would be below 9k nothing really changed. Too many people watching 15 min charts.

Sry I didn't buy the book if it is somewhere mentioned in the book.

If you had invested in the DJI Industrial Average at the worst time in 1929, you would have gained around 7000&amp; So 70 times return. \(on average you gain about 7&amp; .  If you bought at a normal time bit earlier or later it would be 140 x return.  
The S&amp;P500 is performing slightly better but is only around since 1980
Inflation last 100 years is about 2500&amp; 5000&amp; . So the indexfunds still outpacing inflation and gold by quite a bit.
It is possible that the whole system will collapse, but if you want to prepare for it. You should stack weapons and food and maybe some gold in small pieces. 
In the last years we are again quite a bit over the average. Since 2008 there is no real downswing. On average we have a downtrend about every 10\-15 years.  So maybe not the best time to invest big now.
Just some facts. How you want to invest depends on your future outlook and the situation.

1 month slow uptrend already starting to fail. "ye will will grow pretty much 5&amp; each weak" who cares what happened before that. I just draw a line at this uptrend what can go wrong :P
The first big jump up was only as big as it was because shorts where on an all time high so it forced a chainreaction. Where 100x millions had to be stopped out or liquidated.   The moves after that had way less volume then the downmoves. Volume and how it is generated does tell you a lot. It don't know where we go next but we are not at the start of a bull run. Because in a bull run up you have increasing volume on pretty much every move up.

I think you follow the wrong people or checking the frontpage with the first colorful TA maybe. 
Ye the guys "bailed" but more around 16k not 6k. and ye every single one of them suggested to take your profits out\(that is what you call bailing\). and ye every single one of them also reentered already. Even if it is mixed if his is just a local uptrend but guess what you can just "bail" again in profit when you know what you do. Where you enter a market is often way more important then when you exit because as long as you enter at a turning point you preserve your capital. Everyone who entered BTC above 10k was just greedy and stupid. Some still made good profit but only because more and more greedy people fomoed in. I have a uncle which ask me to help buy BTC at 15k. Thankfully I could talk him out of it.

It is knows as a normal market cycle.  
consolidation \-\&gt; slow growing \-\&gt;bull run \- \&gt;crash \-\&gt; repeat . 
The only difference is that BTC makes all moves stronger and faster.  In the normal stock market such a cycle can take 10\-30 years.  In BTC it is closer to 3 years.
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:13:32
Just different triggers for the market/and the people to react.    only the big old companies get somewhat close traded to their economic factual data. 
All the new IT companies or Tesla... are all traded based on future speculation what the companies could become in the future.   
and even for the big companies the economic data are just triggers. You get nearly always an massive overreation if the numbers are slithery off.   2008 the stock market crashed about 50&amp; down but the gdp only about 6&amp; Fact based trading?
BTC has no numbers to grab on but the point is that you still don't go from a crash right into the next bullrun. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 12:39:35
keep in mind they can also break down. They are just break out more often to the top.  Trading is a game of probability. yes we broke the strong downtrend channel with the last push up and yes this is a pennant which is usually a bullish sign. but when someone tells you


you know he is full of shit.
As a trader you trade the most likely outcome and you have to be prepared for EVERY outcome because no one can tell the future. Else there would not be some poor CEO from amazon the richest person on earth.

right "hyperinflation is imminent". Inflation is happening since 1930 but there are no signs for a hyperinflation happening anytime soon. Hyperinflation happens, when the people and other countries stop giving the dollar value.  Which could happen or not but it has nothing to do with the dept clock.

TA still works it is all just probability. 
In no market you can predict a events to 100&amp; In normal markets you have repeating pattern, which are 70\-80&amp; reliable. In Cypto you have more like 60&amp; . Which is totally fine as long as you have good entry/exit points.   
In crypto you can setup trades a lot. Because getting stopped out even 5 times with a 1&amp; loss. Doesn't matter as long as you catch the 10&amp; jump.  
So you have higher uncertainty in the market but you can have a high risk to reward ratio in crypto. Which makes up for it.

Enough things happened in 2011 and 2015 but nothing which really impacted the market in a big way that the S&amp;P 500 or the DJI dropped significantly. and we always came back to the median in the last 100 years over time. That might not happen in 5 or 10 years but it will happen. Acting smug, insulting and 0 information in the comment classic. Markets have cycles I prefer to buy in the downcycles of the market and sell when crash pattern occur. That is called risk management.

It does but only when we fail the breakout here. We are in a pig pennant and inside that pennant formed a smaller pennant right now. If we fail here we will test the other end of the big pennant. somewhere around 7200\-7400$.
I am still hopeful we can break out to the top here but it is more like 55\-60&amp; since volume in the last moves was still low compared to the volume in the downmoves when we crashed.

The point is it has nothing to do with the history. Bitcoin or any other asset doesn't give a f if you bought in 50% higher.
You have to evaluate your position based on the current situation and not about what your asset was worth in the past.
So this "advice" doesn't tell you absolute nothing.
Should you sell because the price drops ? No. but should you hold just because the price drops? also NO
It should not factor into your decision. Your decisions are tainted by the emotional investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.

That way private banks operate pretty much everywhere in the world. 
They get 1000$ from the FED and they are able to loan 100000 $ with the 1000$ . So only 1\-2&amp; of the money is actually from the EZB and FED and co. all other money comes out of thin air from the private banks.  
and all the gains are going into their pockets and if they fuck up they get the next bail out. 
Not to mention that they get the initial money since several years for \~0&amp; .

that is pretty flawed logic. Inflation and deflation have both many effects. Low deflation is certainly not the death of a economy like Japan shows. Both have a lot of effects on the economy.

BTC has no key numbers where you can base you price on. 
People last december didn't value btc 4 times higher. Their feeling told them it would go higher So they bought. Atm more people think it is going lower so they sell. 
After a crash people take profits on every local high. Which makes the run up the 2. time always slower and harder. If we get someday over the all time high. People will FoMo in again. It is all pretty simple. Because people are pretty simple.

Guns usually don't prevent these kind of break ins. Normal people don't have the gun open on the table. You don't get 30 sec heads up that something like that happens.

at best it is a hidden wealth tax (a lot of other countries have also a normal wealth tax)
but I guess you are also one of the people who say that tax is overall theft.
and let me guess you won't have a problem to get free money from deflation without any risk?
deflation and inflation is always redistribution from some people to other people. Like I said there is no black and white and it is not possible to keep 0&amp; deflation/ inflation.
Also contrary to common believe a country can't just control the inflation/deflation rate. The amount of money adds  over a period of time to the inflation rate but the money amount is not equal to the inflation rate. 
but if you read up on Japan and the fight against deflation you will learn that it isn't an easy process without killing your economy or your currency.

What has that to do with anything. Big miners selling pretty regularly. If you are a big miner that is your main business. You don't hold the BTC for the next 5 years until the next big bubble comes around.
ofc they are not driving the price down alone because they always sell. but ye China is a thing and Bitmex for example said that 2/3 of their volume is from the asia region. The western world still lives in their bubble but China doesn't play catch up anymore. China has a pretty big upper class which matters in markets a lot.
@_date: 2018-06-30 03:14:46
where you get the 2&amp; from? 
There is a point when you get above 7&amp; deflation pretty risk free where many investments are not worth it anymore. Why do I risk my money in a company when I barely get the same amount with way higher risk.
ofc the whole discussion is pointless for quite a while since the uncontrollable BTC will have bubbles and volatility  for a long long time. (imho)

Everyone knows how BTC performed in the past. Still doesn't tell you the future.

mining difficulty increases when more people are mining. That happens because of 2 factors decreasing cost of mining or higher price of bitcoin. 
I mean it is a very important metric for miner so you can find out if you can be profitable. 
for everything else it isn't that important you are right.
Last year mining difficulty went down about 30 % since the price went down a lot and miners stopped in countries were electricity isn't extremely cheap.

I would say for 90&amp; of the people the money is saver in a normal bank. (we might get there in the future but we are not there yet for the avg user.)

There will be enough Satoshis. It doesn't matter when over time a couple million bitcoins get lost in the nirvana.
and people won't start to purposely destroy their bitcoins. Even if there would be some big movement (can't imagine why) destroying all their bitcoins. It would just push the price up for the rest of them.
So there is not really a problem here. Since the amount of bitcoin doesn't really matter.
1000 bitcoins = 100000000000 Satoshis.

well just some points you should also consider. 
1. You still don't suspect the weak woman to have a gun in their house even if there are liberal gun laws. It might get ugly in the robbery but won't prevent it. 
2. 18 year old wannabe also are getting suddenly more dangerous and feel more confident to pull of a robbery with a weapon they can just buy anywhere. 
Sure you might say you can get weapons in every country illegal if you search long enough but they are quite some steps to get there.
3. The big big amount of robberies are planned around empty homes. Most encounters with homeowners are on accident. If they have weapons in the home or not again doesn't change anything. (and again you don't know if they have weapons at home anyway.)

He isn't FUDing and he isn't promoting gold. He just explained to you how WB usually invest and why Bitcoin isn't something WB would invest in. The same goes for corn, milk, silver, gold and bitcoin.
The Bitcoin price is determined by supply and demand. Is this difficult to understand? There is nothing wrong with that and with the limited supply that Bitcoin has by default, there is a very high chance that the price will rise as long as demand at least rises a little.

He wrote it in response to the price being down. The rate bitcoins get mined doesn't change. It was the same when the price was at 1400, 19000 and now at 6300.
until 2015-07-29 it was about 1,312,500 each year.

It is not about paying off all debt in the world but when you want to keep the current system running the big countries have to stabilise  the debt to keep the trust in the system longer. If the US doubles the debt they have ever all 10 years and finance that with their own "money from the fed"(that is the problem here). Then there is no way around a hyperinflation in the next 15 years. 
but if the US would show reason and just grow it a small amount every year. The "Bad End" would take many more years until it happens.

That service would you give the data when you use your bitcoin(giving them the address from your spending wallet or whatever). Why would you want that. Just make it weekly and if you buy something big make it manual. It isn't that complicated.

Why have you doubts about decentralised solution of a company? In the case the servers wouldn't be decentralised most likely but your cryptocurrency will be staying on your pc until you make the trade. (Which is the most important point).  and ofc the development is centralised in that case.   
you don't need to have decentralisation for the sake of decentralisation. You need to think about what the benefit is.  
guess what even wikipedia is centralised.

It means he risk 600$ in the trade. If the price goes in the wrong (in this case down) direction for more than 2% you get liquidated and your money is gone. 
2%\*50 = 100% 
Pretty stupid to go 50x in crypto because you leave no room for small swings before the big move. So even if you are right you might get liquidated right before the money move happens. 
but ofc it is exiting to gamble on 50x. I did it also quite a bit with play money after all it also feels amazing to make 
\+200% in some minutes. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 20:36:44
ofc it is possible.
Germany went down from 81% to 62% in a couple of years with just not doing more and more tax cuts.
The US makes every couple of years tax cuts which mostly benefit the rich and cooperations. So ofc the dept increases.  There are even things like wealth tax in other countries like Switzerland, Norway.. that would fill the treasuries in no time. Ofc a tax like that will never happen in the US. So it has nothing to do with the ability to keep it down because that isn't the goal.
The rich and cooperations rather have the $ fail at some point in the future than to pay a bigger cut. If you are rich you have a way bigger % of your net worth in assets anyway. So you are impacted far less from high inflation rates.

Didn't say it will. We agree on that. I was just under the impression that they wanted to keep the system running as long as possible. Which would include increasing the debt only slowly but lately since 2008 it seems they want to crush the trust and the system as soon as possible. Many other countries also jumped in debt in 2008 but after worked on reducing or at least keeping the debt stable. The US doesn't even try to slow it down and the problem comes with higher and higher amount of debt to your own Fed. If other countries/companies want to give you very cheap money you can go ahead.

It is true that there is more dept in $ in the world than real $ in circulation but that doesn't prevent the US nation from paying back their debt.
Other banks are creating 10$ via loans from every $ from the Fed. So there is plenty of $ going around. That the total amount doesn't add up at the end doesn't really matter to keep the system running.
It is a trust base system and always was. If everyone wants their money back and nobody gives out new loans the system fails.
That is what nearly happened 2008 banks didn't want to give other banks loans anymore.

It is always a chain reaction because people have sell orders placed on the exchanges. You just need to sell until you reach the point were many people have the sell orders placed to get this big jumps.
\+bots also react on big price movements and try to get orders in as soon as the price starts to drop.
\+liquidated longs who trigger
and it is not like a whale can just do it. There can be other hidden big whales orders who trigger when you sell.
So it isn't as simple as look at the exchanges and see you need to sell 500 bitcoins or whatever to do it and that dude who says 10k bitcoins doesn't know how markets work. With 10k bitcoin 50x leveraged you would risk 2 billion on the move lol.

double would only be 100% increase and you can find many different metrics. Whatever you take you can't possible find that your money is only worth 1/3 of that 10 years ago.  Gold was 900$ in 2008 and is now 1200$ that is 30% not (if not even outright doubled). Not to mention  taking gold as inflation measurement for the US when it is a global trading good is pretty useless don't you think? 
We have enough inflation already no need to be delusional that we are already in the hyperinflation state. (which ofc can happen in the future)

it went up massive all year 2018 until late october. Now ask yourself it is a good indicator ?
Miners react to the market not the other way around. It is not a leading indicator it is a delayed indicator up to a year. That is what the chart tells you and that is also what the fundamentals tell you. 
The exception is only the halvening because without any market changes the rewards get cut in halve and less new bitcoins floating into the market. but that is not the steady difficult changes.

The big miners are selling pretty regularly. Their main business model is mining Bitcoin not speculating on future prices. They are fine and they will keep selling like they always do.

You clearly wrote as if this number would mean something to you and I just tried to help you understand why it doesn't. I can only go of what you wrote and a huge number of people here invested never in their life before bitcoin. 


Also here was not my intent to say you don't know what a chart is but people in in general are very defensive any time they see a chart. Which is strange because a chart can show you a lot of information very detailed . (to use the information right is another story) . 


Fair point but usually people don't speak to much about their investment strategies at parties and I usually can tell when it is a joke.

It is all confidence intervals. If you don't understand statistics and read stupid clickbait messages who tell you "it will go 100% now this direction  " it is your fault. There is never 100% in any stock or any other market.

If it takes 15 years until we reach that point ye maybe maybe not. 
Not to mention that even if you don't convert it back you are still INVESTING into the future of BTC. You only do that because you think it has more valuable in the future. If you don't think it has value in the future you would not convert your valuable money into it.

before the btc bubbles were also because of hype and money people wanted to make. Bubbles in pretty much any market are good in the long run. Without all the media hype and all the capital which went into btc 2013 and now we would have still a world where maybe 0.5&amp; of the western world even heard the word bitcoin. 
We are now in a world where the average person knows the word bitcoin. That is a big step forward would you agree? 
It makes it people also more open to learn and speak about it. 
Without any bubble and hype we would be lucky to have 50 $/btc by now.
Always try to see the downsides and the upsides.

I have only a small amount in BTC right now since I took profit at 13.5k in december.
and just buying slowly some back. I know risk management but I also see the potential.


Seems to me you are the bind one when you can't see the potential. and not to fall in love with a trade is not even a rule you need to have when you have a plan.

While technically the example is true. coinmarketcap doesn't add coins which are not even traded a reasonable amount. If many people trade a coin with 10m in circulation for 10$ than they seem to value it about that price. 
There is also not that much incentive to manipulate the metric. Except for pump and dump reasons but after a short time they return to a reasonable valuation. 


You need first define what you mean by that. 
The marketcap dominance is at 45% not more not less. That it might not be the best measurement is another discussion.

if btc was forever 10 cent widespread adoption and using it as a currency never happened. You need to keep some amount of BTC to pay with it or send it somewhere.
That is called demand and if you have increased demand on a limited asset. It goes up in value.
So sure it would function in theory but when noone is using it how can it carry out its purpose?
You might want to switch to tether they are solved your problem with the limited supply.

yes that is a plus point. On the other hand not a lot of money on other markets came in in the uptrend of the last days. It is mostly just came from the alts. Which means we still need to wait and see if big money of other markets comes back into crypto(bitcoin) to get a strong uptrend.

No investor picks out a random date when he analyses a asset. You work with medians over several years. At least as long as you plan to invest. 
Like I said the 183&amp; is just a random number in the range of possible annualized returns.

only on paper for a very short time. As soon as you try to sell your coins the price drops if there is no demand. 
So you still have to create a ecosystem with demand for your coin if you don't want to be a billionaire   for 5 minutes on paper.
btw. Ripple managed exactly that they controlled about 60% at the start and still have estimated about 55 % .

ye early investors always make the biggest gain. If it is a company or BTC or whatever else.

He is talking out of his ass. Binance was never hacked. stupid users activating API trading and losing their keys in fishing sites. 
and they reacted very good to it. Withdraw was closed automatically in seconds when the irregular trading happened. 
and this is just completely fud. They had maintenance so they closed withdraw and trading at the time. With is logical when it is a bigger upguard and not all functions are working.  
not sure what he even means with "get back stabbed"
Binance growth was pretty insane and they are handling it very good imho.

There is no best investment. Different sectors have different risk and are affected from different parameters. That is why you diversify.

other situation. after a crash people take profits at every new local high. These extreme % jumps are possible after 20k again when people have no past, no measurement so they can again just fomo in.
but until then sellers will slow down the progress.
e:As pretty as jump looks the last days people should keep in mind that a big part right now is people going from alts back into bitcoin which is good but we need a strong uptrend the money out of other markets need to come in.

@_date: 2018-07-03 21:53:35
It gets lower with increased volume. It is a slow transition. No currency has close to 0 Even the $ has a annualized volatility of about 7&amp; 
Ofc BTC is FAR away from it but as you maybe noticed BTC can grow for quite a while as asset and from there it can slowly grow as currency.   
There is no other way since there is no one controlling the BTC price. So unless you change BTC and rename it to Tether 2.0 we have to live with high volatility for quite a while.

Ye looks like we overall agree. In my view other cryptocurrencies are good for BTC in the long run because they try out other technologies and therefore push innovation faster. 99&amp; won't survive and people get burned and learn. 
I myself did ride some hypetrains for altcoins.  Fully knowing that the technology behind it isn't worth it. I think as long as you are aware of it and see it as a very high risk investment/gamble than there is nothing wrong with it. 
(when you drag other people into it it is another story.)


I would just like to add that they learn more, see the value in decentralization and that it can't be controlled by a small group. After that they stay for the technology  AND the money. 
Which is a important nuance and there is nothing wrong with look out for yourself.

this. I am very bullish on BTC and the OP doesn't understand when you short or what it is.
You don't open a short position and leave it open until 0$. BTC was a VERY good shorting opportunity. Dropping 70&amp; in 3 month. If you are hodl'er fine but making stupid comments about things you don't understand.. and it still gets upvoted. hodl'er  at its best again.

the whole move from 6800 is pretty weak in volume compared to the downmoves still. 
It just jumped so hard because shorts where on all time high. So some big buyers forced a chain reaction which closed 50%  of the shorts on bitmex in an hour(there where several 10million liquidations on shorts). This needs a lot more buy support following just the price tells you not much.
@_date: 2018-07-19 09:34:12

shorting is just making money when the market is going down.
If you short 1000 $ with 10x . 
You have a 10000 position open. 
When the market goes down 10% and you close your short you gained 1000 $. 
If they market goes up 10% you don't have enough money to cover your position. So your position gets liquidated and your 1000$ are gone.


What he means is that many positions get liquidated.

To be fair in the history deflation always was very bad for the economy. 
Just think about it why would you loan anyone money, invest in a company or whatever if you had a main currency with 10% deflation.

The last rally was from 600 to 20k . My point is that every rally to this point was about the same strength. Ofc it will slow down at some point. 
but isn't it fair to assume that it is at least a possibly that the next 2\-3 rallies together could have the same strength then the last rally that happened? I mined a bit when it was 54$ and sold them and forgot about btc for years.  It is hard for the human mind to think logarithmic and not in linear scale but that is what you have to do when you evaluate assets. 


also your 5 cent number is stupid why not say 0 then and BTC had infinite  growth.  When it hit real exchanges \(MTgox, bitfinex \)it started to sell around 50 $. before that it was just traded hand to hand for very random amounts or gifted.
on your scale every company in history started at 0.01$.

I would say most people never traded before BTC here and even less experienced crash pattern. Since there where not many assets crashing last 10 years. 
I mean if you trade on 30 min timeframe you have trouble I guess.  (or when you want to catch the complete bottom or top) 
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:10:11
but your phone company also sells less. So you won't get a added 10% "deflation return" .  That is my point that the economy will suffer a lot. 
In the Great Depression we had deflation. The masses didn't get rich in that time. 
Since then pretty much all countries try to have a steady inflation rate. 
Deflations hits the poor the hardest. Since a big % of their income are things they have to buy no matter what.
 
It also disincentivize investors from investing, People from buying homes , people from creating companies... 
@_date: 2018-04-30 17:37:27
your chart is linear. The standard used by traders is logarithmic since a jump from 10 to 1000 is more significant than from 1000 to 1990.
If you trade the &amp; changes count for your assets and that is what the logarithmic scale shows you.
\(It has more impact on the price since most traders use it. It has more impact on the price. linear still get used a bit but less. So usually the resistance lines are weaker. \) After all the traders form the price.
\(if you are in a short timeframe both are very close anyway.\)
and just a tip you should try to have a open mind to things you don't understand right away and not dismiss them as "wrong" from the get go. Even if you don't mean it that way it sounds dismissive and narrow minded.

I guess you learned. 


is the classic fomo which went insane from 10 to 19k. There were still dips but compared so small and so short lived. 
one of the best methods without a lot  analyzing is just dollar cost average on the way down after every big drop. 
imho everyone how bought above 10k in December was a bigger fool. You try to buy in low even if you bought in a local high.
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:49:18


So will BTC someday. It is just some data on a blockchain. The people give it value. (that someday might be 10000 years in the future or 20 years time will tell)
The difference is that a small group can't decide if deflation or inflation happens. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:53:40
well don't be an idiot then. Now it is too late to sell ofc. 
I agree that if you never traded in your life and don't understand risk management or don't even know what Dollar cost averaging is better hodl but claiming that hodling is the best thing you can do when BTC goes down 70% is a joke. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 18:17:20
well ye it all depends on the timeframe you trade on. 
The hodl'ers here should just watch the monthly chart every 3 month. That would save them a lot of time :) 
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:54:33
watch any chart including the history of btc when a 70% crash happens it goes sideways where people slowly acquire are a low price after the initial crash.
I don't say the next bull run won't come but this was no dip where we jump back to 20k in a month. 
So when his was the bottom (which is not yet clear) we will gain slowly for a while. 
Trusting the price direction is a slow process until you reach the point where people fomo in again.

You realise that it would be about the same as the jump from 600 to 20k and we did that in one year. 
and the jump to 1200 was even stronger and before that the jump to 10\+ .. 
I don't make a prediction when that happen or even if that happens but that you can't even see that it could happen in the "ever" timeframe seems strange too me.
ofc gold will still be around and do well. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 18:03:05
I don't think you know how covering a short works. 
If you want to get out of your short you have to buy which is pushing the price up. 
Also after the big jump up the shorts are increasing again not decreasing. Longs are decreasing. You didn't check and stats and just made wild guesses..
This is not a prediction where the price goes just facts. Trading based on running long and short positions is the worst thing you can do anyway.
@_date: 2018-07-16 13:25:46

wtf are you talking about. Your muscles still build. They will just be covered by a fat layer.
Don't paint stupid black and white bullshit you need both a healthy diet AND you need to build the muscles.
If you just go on a calorie deficit you look like a anorexic girl.
If you only train and eat like shit you still get strong but look like every other fat person.
If you train and go on a calorie deficit and some point your abs will show eventually.
If you do nothing and eat like shit you look like every other fat lazy person.


Never read such a bullshit without exercise nothing happens. Just because you don't need to put in a lot of time to build muscle doesn't mean they magical build up on their own when you don't stimulate them.

it is pretty easy to call that the $, Euro and whatever will fail at some point in the future but it could take 5 years, 15 years or 40 years. 
People say every year it looks so bad and debt is as high as never before but that is true every year. As long as the general public has trust in the $ it will continue to work even if the dept is 5 times as high. 
Sure it could also fail fast with strong economical prices. Point is no one knows no matter how much statistics you see how bad it is right now. 
The way bitcoin works it won't go away but it is certainly no save way to get rich fast. It is a hedge against the fiat system long term.

China never banned bitcoin. They banned exchanges. I was in Shenzhen last year and they are completely legal bitcoins meets every week. and people trade there bitcoin without any fear of being arrested because again it is and was legal. 
Closing down the exchanges is still a big deal but it would be nice to stay with the facts.

you neglect the context. He is talking about the end stage of the hyperinflation when he put away billion RM bills.
He went from using 1000 RM bills to 1.000.000.000 RM bills in the same year. If you bought anything at all you got the context. When you heat up your house with old money.
Everyone gets it at that point that is why hyperinflation happens in the first place because everyone from kids to old people lost trust in the money.
I am German and knew people who were alive at the time(now they are dead) I can tell you that everyone tried to spend the money they got as fast as possible or change it in anything including bricks to trade them later.
It is not that people don't get that gold and silver coins are better in a time like that. It is the fact that you can't get them because literally everyone wants them. We didn't had a hyperinflation like that in any big country in the last 50 years.
and no venezuela isn't even close to that yet (29000% inflation in a month in 1923)

bit retarded comment don't you think? some month ago when you could sell bitcoin for 7000 or more ofc people would love to buy for 3400. Be a millionaire in a day.

Everyone because 0 bitcoins get sold and 0 bitcoins get bought. No company would except bitcoin anymore. So everyone with bitcoin has useless wallets with useless coins.
ofc what follows is that people lower the price again until someone buys and we are back to 3k$/bitcoin.

If you visit shenzhen there are local bitcoin meetings every week and yes you can buy sell bitcoin with the people there.

"back to the bear market" 
You have to leave the bear market before you can go back into it. Just because you have a small pump doesn't change the whole market. 
Last year when we dipped from 7 to 6k , 11 to 9 k, 16 to 13 we never left the bull market same concept now.
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:04:43
and in reality doesn't help at all. Because there is no "everyone is saying that". At every point there are tons of people for every direction.
Even last december on the biggest FOMO wave ever. People were totally split between "you lose all your money if you don't get out now" and the "we totally go to $200k you will miss out so hard if you don't buy now" at the christmas party with totally random people.
If you read this sub now still 90% believes to get rich with btc here. So it must be right to sell if you follow the logic right?

he was living in a time with hyperinflation. He went from getting 100 rm to getting 1.000.000.000 rm for the same stuff. You don't need to understand economics if you life though that. There is literally no one who does buy stuff in the grocery shop who doesn't understand that. People did burn money to heat.  Literally no one thought in that time that the money will get worth more. Pretty much every month you could throw away your old money because it was only worth 1/100 of the value of the old money.
It says 10 Billion on that one Note come on...
The value of one gold mark went in 1923 from 10.000 to 1.000.000.000.000
I am German and my dead grandma was alive in that time and they burned and played with the money.
It is more likely that he forgot the money for a month in the hiding place and didn't bother to throw it away after.
and you need to be about as smart as a little kid to understand that. comparing the understanding of the situation with "building a house" good joke.

Many people in China still have a lot of bitcoin.
People with money in china have also assets in $. If you just have Yuan on a chinese bank the only somewhat legal way is to convert it locally person to person.
but I was more referring to trading other cryptocurrencies and on bitfinex daytrading.
but it is hard at the moment to convert very big amounts from Yuan to Bitcoin atm. (like I already said)

"useless" is a bit much. Gold is the safe bet where you can be sure it won't lose all the value in the next crises. but there are enough companies which sell stuff which people will buy in crises or not. 
It is like saying everything but bitcoin is useless because it has 20x and higher in just one year. Higher potential gains are coming usually with higher risk. 
Gold has low risk but the gains are also moderate in the short term.

@_date: 2019-05-24 11:52:41
ye true. for a next block transaction you would need to pay around $2 but if you have 1/2 day you can still send very cheap.If you look at the mempool usually everything above 2 Satoshis/byte goes though.
So a realistic range for one transaction atm is 0.03$ to 3$ can we agree on that?

you don't think very highly of your grandpa than. Back in the day way more people did hide money somewhere  which they could access fast. 
If you live through the hyperinflation and people running around with wheelbarrow full of money to buy some bread. You don't think "One day it will all to back to normal and I will be the only one who was smart enough to keep the money".

Not really people care about money and things they care about. 
There is right now not that much reason I could convince my mother or my uncle to learn about bitcoin when they are not even tech savvy people. 
Even here no one is talking more about using bitcoin it is only about "hodling". I myself used bitcoin only 4 years ago to try it out a couple of times. Worked fine was cool but it doesn't give me much what I don't have right now.   
Bitcoin is here to stay and everyone has already the option to use it which is the important part. If it is needed because of high inflation or whatever it will be used more. Bitcoin plays the long game even if it doesn't look that way with years like in 2017.

A meme about the price? :thinking:
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:51:23
god that has nothing to do with the fees since you also don't wait 10 minutes for every customer for confirmations.
That is something where you need lightning network or other solution.
In reality if your kids make a lemonade stand you will just see if they did the transaction. Most people are not going to double spend the btc to fuck you over for 1$ because guess what to double spend you need to make a transaction with a higher fee.
So you think people try to spend 3-5$ to not give you the 1$ for the lemonade?
I already wrote the available range but spending more does nothing for your great lemonade stand story sorry.
also not to mention that you need to set it up your "double spend" wallet with the right amount of funds beforehand (which also cost fees to transfer your funds there)
TLDR: confirmations are for big amounts were it is worth to fuck you over not for lemonades or coffees.
@_date: 2019-05-29 19:32:00
Don't think there is a hard cap. Person to person is allowed overall and more people do it now since the exchanges are closed( ofc with VPN many people still trade on other exchanges) just a bit harder to change Chinese Yuan  into Bitcoin. 
20000 Yuan or something like that is definitely not uncommon to trade locally. 
I think China cares more about the big fishes who could too easy convert a fortune into bitcoin and get it out of china(speculation on my part).

ofc this is one tiny step but every single step counts. Adoption is not a on or off switch it is a long process unless some rich country gets in the hyperinflation state.
On top of that being aware of bitcoin is a big step away from actually buying bitcoin AND using it. Which are at best 10% of these people.

The thing is you just bought the loaf of bread from the fancy bakery for 20 $ just to resell it for 1$ to someone else since nobody wants to pay more for it.
You had 20 $ in the morning now you have 1$. 
ofc in a single trade in a vacuum both agree to the trade but there are still bad trades.
