Sold? These neck beards won’t be told.

I bought in at $16k

I’ve been raped by bitcoin!

Half the weight though

Crazy how they’ve gone up. I had a 1999 Elise in 2005. I paid £8,200 for it, approx $11,000.

Transfer fee was 1.95% they lost the rest in currency conversion which you will lose on transferwise too and even bitcoin once you put it into local currency

Its a close second to naming it - Hack my bitcoins

So 1/3 dont then, where as 100% has access to cash

I had a butt plug like that, had to throw it once it got soiled 
@_date: 2018-06-27 11:26:27
So the people who are living not with cash, what are they living off?
What is there medium for exchange? 1 chicken = 1 haircut. 1 cow = 6 chickens. 1 blow job = 2 chickens. I guess it works.
@_date: 2018-06-26 15:30:15
Yes because everybody in the developing world has a smart phone

Cash out at $2k for those zero losses!

You dont need to work another day but you held? Solds like you sold dude.

I started my business off my student loan, 15 years ago. Still going strong.
I moved home to my parents for the second year, but still took the full loan of £6,000 and sowed the seeds to start my own business. I did the same for the third year. Interest free loan in the UK
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:16:13
Very positive, I am about to buy back in. I came in at $1,000 and always intended to cash out if it ever got to $10,000 but where it kept rising i really didn’t know what to do, every day I considered cashing out. Finally I cashed out at $17,000. 
I’m now looking to come back in but hoping for bit more of a drop and then strapping in for another ride. But I’m only re-investing 10-15% of my gains.
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:07:26
About $1 is a fair price

Sure, you can quote me by name.

Always carry a bit of cash in case you lose your card or it stops working. I took just my card abroad once and it was immediately blocked as I used it in a foreign country. Took hours to resolve
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:45:06
Ever bought them where they go down and never come back? I have.
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:40:09
Yep, my brother is a builder and he has 4 months of work doing a house extension for a guy who cashed out $80,000 worth of bitcoin.

The advantage of companies accepting Bitcoin is that people can cash out large chunks of bitcoin without the IRS ever knowing about it. My buddy bought a bad ass gaming PC and paid his builder in bitcoin. He says he won’t be telling the IRS about those coins.
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:15:19
Not for a small business.  Medium and large, yes.
@_date: 2018-03-23 04:39:39
Not at all. I was just sharing an anecdote of using a student loan not for its purpose.

That’s like saying when Picasso painted a masterpiece it only had value when someone bought it/ paid money for it. A Picasso painting had huge value before he even started it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:41:10
That’s impossible

How can a company knock 20% off, do you think companies are avoiding taxes ?
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:45:39
I said the same to my dad at $4k, he was not happy at $18k
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:20:16
Yes, if he cashed out he would only spend it on hookers and blow.
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:10:38
Which is? Tell us! I want in
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:50:02
Sell when the amount changes your life, 3 coins was $50-$60k last month. If you are a poor student who wants to travel the world for a couple of years or a relatively poor dad who wants to fund college for his kids etc etc, then sell! If you are already a millionaire and $50k ain’t changing a thing then hodl to if/when it does

London has quite a few places accepting it, Londoners love there tax evasion. I paid a hooker I’m Soho using bit coin, blew my mind then my load over her stomach (mind first as you have to pay hookers in advance kids)

Pretty ironic, talking about deprecating assets when Bitcoin went from $19k to $7k...
@_date: 2018-04-15 01:45:31
Who knows how the price of bitcoin will go... but I stand by my original point - its pretty funny seeing someone talk about cashing out of bitcoin and buying a depreciating asset when Bitcoin over the last 5 months lost 2/3’s of it value until the recent little gain.
@_date: 2018-04-15 01:21:59
To fit my narrative? So 19k to 7k is much different to 19k to 8k?
The car is worth at its peak value say $40k. After a year its probably worth $30k. Now what was bitcoins peak value and what is it worth today? Which depreciated more?
