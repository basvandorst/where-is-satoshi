Exactly this. People were getting butthurt because they were trying to withdraw $10,000+ through the online portal. To be fair, though, they probably don’t know that the SAR form is required.

If you withdraw more than $10,000, Coinbase won’t process the transaction without regulatory approval (as required by US securities law to prevent money laundering, money parking, etc). So some Redditors got butthurt and thought that Coinbase was stealing their Bitcoin since they’re money didn’t immediately hit their bank account.
EDIT: IANAL, but I think it’s $10,000 or more per every 30 days. I’m not entirely sure about the length of time required by the SEC.

IIRC, it was his first ever TV interview in his life. I would have probably done some of the same things if I was in a similar situation.

Honestly, I can see LTC becoming the new dominant crypto if BTC continues to have infighting like BCH.
Get your shit together Bitcoin.

Byteball is the big one. I thought there was a second drop scheduled for a lesser known coin, but I could be mistaken.

There's also a couple of airdrops in the next few days that need BTC, so it's still a good idea to have all your BTC in one wallet for the time being.

Is Electrum considered safe? My only annoyance is that it uses multiple addresses for "privacy".
