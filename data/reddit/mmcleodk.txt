Thats a LOT of chicken lol

I'll buy a lot if it gets down to $500! That's one hell of a flash sale ;)
@_date: 2017-01-05 20:05:35
Sell low buy high?

I'm starting my open season now, but will double efforts if we get another dead cat bounce

The manifest destiny, duh! ;)

Honestly I'm always leery to buy when something has just jumped in price because market corrections are pretty common. That being said as a longer term investment I think the odds of it suddenly crashing to 0 are quite low.
That being said government/bank intervention could either decrease the value or possibly cause the price to explode upwards, it's hard to say at this point. 
I have/will continue to invest a portion of my investment money into btc and xmr because I see that there is a lot of upward potential. (My other main investments are stock of growing companies I like and precious metals, but only when my research leads me to feel they are undervalued).

Always remember that you only really take a loss if you sell low. Otherwise you're just stuck holding it until it rallys.
Also if it drops then consider it as being on sale ;) good chance to pick up more (assuming there hasn't been a large change that makes it unlikely to ever recover).

Technically true :p though your descendants will likely sell it to make splitting your assets easier.
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:02:34
True! I generally try to sell when it's been spiking upwards and buy during dips/crashes. Trickier if you do business in the currency though

Too soon...

I would still suggest a bit of diversification but certainly assets like gold/silver bullion (not numismatics), bitcoin, monero, or specific well researched stocks are all better bets than dollars. You're guaranteed a roughly 4% per year decline on dollars due to regular inflation with almost no chance of a gain.
Personally I prefer more cash flow type investments (reit, dividend stocks, real estate, etc) over buy and gold type assets whenever possible but they tend to be a bit more expensive to obtain and take more savvy than a buy and hold strategy.

True, but 780 that saves you from losing your house now might seem better at the time that 4.8 million in ten years. That's all I was getting at, relative value.

Oh some days it still does ;)

Sucker, I'm in alberta now, there are no jobs lol

Have you ever hung out with us? That's certainly not how most describe Canucks lol
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:34:18
True! Or be cashing out early because of financial hardship

I'm listening to that song right now :p I get off work in an hour and have a joint rolled waiting for me lol

Depends how broke you are :p

So long as it doesn't come back down the only thing lost is potential gains. I sold most at 2000 and put some into smaller cryptos as prospecting money while I wait for what I feel is the next time to hop on.

Just a fun idea ;) I used to do a bit of guerrilla marketing for my fitness company back when I was a personal trainer so I like coming up with ideas like that.

Probably monitoring it and gathering intel hoping to trace some big orders or find info on other markets etc.
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:18:56
Oh no, it just means go big or go home ;) I think we need a "btc superhero" suit with a mask that way anybody can pick up the mantle.

I spat out my drink, well done 
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:21:35
Right? How is excitedly buying dips a bad thing? It's what recovers the market from dips :p
Agreed panic sellers are the worst :p though they do create opportunities!
@_date: 2017-07-14 00:48:33
I was thinking something 60's space age like a gold Mylar onesie and a round gold painted helmet/goggles complete with a cape. The btc logo on the hemet and cape, maybe a giant gold btc necklace. Really make a spectacle of it, the whole point is to draw attention ;)

Second option is sell 50% to cover original costs and keep the remaining 50 in to see what happens ;)
