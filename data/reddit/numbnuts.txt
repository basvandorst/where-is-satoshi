... I compared Bitcoin (for currency) with Napster (for music) for my friends &amp; family 6 or so months ago to make it understanble to them .... now I have a real source making the analogy for me to share with them ... its a close enough analogy I think they will get it .... Plus it makes me look like Nostradamus in their eyes ... I think Ill buy a cigar and red velvet robe to wear around at our next social gathering

Thats why mBTC (mBits) as a descriptive unit of bitcoins needs to catch on ! .... its much easier to buy units of mBits.

... I remember the whole "people will never bank online" groans back then 90's .... now everyone does it ... Bitcoin now reminds me of the way people (that were online anyway) though about buying stuff in general online back in 1993-1994 ... Amazon in 1994 &amp; Ebay in 1995 help dramatically.

.... Php is as good as any other language that might be used .... I'll take a look at it in the morning

... these "lost" coins will eventually be a problem (as people with coins in unspent wallets die off etc.) ... given 20-30 years will only a fraction be in circulation ? ... Litecoin has a much larger pool of potential coins ... might be wise to remember Litecoin for the much longer term (20-30 years) or virtual currencies.
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:43:55
... US printing the dollar like its freaking confetti is killing the dollar ! ... we have had a bunch of clowns controlling our monetary policy for the past 50 or more years !

@_date: 2013-12-12 15:41:35
Oh great ... leave it to the US government to mess up a Bitcoin operation .... as if they haven't messed  up the dollar quite enough
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:13:15
.... Fuck China .... wait until India merchants embrace Bitcoin ... China will follow suite eventually just like they do everything else .... I hope they sell all of their bitcoins for that matter ! ... cheaper ones for me to buy ! ... Hell, Ive been buying all morning and got a bunch under .99 mBTC

I recommend  Kracken .... been incredible so far ... anyone having issues with them ? .... never used BTC-E
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:10:48
.... or to be even more nit picky ....  digital currencies, virtual currencies, OR cryptocurrencies would all be appropriate ... take your pick
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:50:50
.... I did I did I did ! .... but there is a slight dip each morning between 5:00 &amp; 8:00 am US central time so I was looking for it and got lucky this time !
