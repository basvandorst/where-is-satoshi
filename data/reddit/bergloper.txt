Smart to drive around with your Bitcoin vanity license plate 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:27:58
Don't worry, just HODL 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:29:52
Thank you for your kind gift and hard work 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:46:25
Wife finally understands... This happens 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:26:10
Need to HODL, just eat spaghetti 
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:59:50
I will never reach 1 BTC..... ��
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:49:11
Yup, that's what I mean... At this rate I won't even reach 1 Bitcoin

These isn't the fiat he's looking for, move on 
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:43:14
Agree with you 100% - this sub (and the other) are like a kindergarden. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:25:45
Could you please explain a bit more 
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:26:33

I always thought Amish drove horse and carriage... 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:06:34
Yes, if you bought high you have to wait... Maybe now is your time to buy more (wait a bit though). If you are in it for the long run, just HODL 
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:40:57
Check for yourself 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:19:42
