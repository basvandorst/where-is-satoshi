Coinbase wont accept the cent values that it charged my card to verify as valid. The result is that it keeps locking my account for 24hrs. This is the second time and now my account is locked again. It also won't let me exit out of verifying that card and add another. At this point, I think my account is permanently trashed and I don't know what to do.

And of course, they're backed up as hell. Maybe I'll have to try that tho. thanks.

Well I don't have either protection tbh because I'm still on the fence if I need it. Id def need it if I was going to start messing with bitcoin.

So I just got a coin base account but I'm seeing Gemini recommended over it. Which has lower trade fees? I read Gemini's trading fees page and got pretty confused by it. 
Thanks.

So I suppose making up a fake SSN to make a gemini account would be a bad thing yeah? Would they just deny the account?
Because after searching and reading a lot of threads in the forum, I don't think I feel comfortable giving out my SSN even with the whole KYC/AML stuff that companies have to follow. I don't mind IDing and bank info but yeah, SSN is too far. And the alternatives that people mention aren't great so I think I might just not do bitcoin after all which is too bad.

Not really interested in gdax if they need my whole social which I think they do. Plus aren't they owned by coinbase too?

GDax also needs my social so no thanks.

Well since there's no way for me to buy crypto without paying about 20$+ in fees per transaction, I think I'm done.
