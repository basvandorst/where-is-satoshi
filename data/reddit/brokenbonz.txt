I'm convinced that the article is fake. Not maliciously fake, but mischievously fake. I think the real article will be entitled "Why Satoshi Nakamoto Is Hiding", and will be published in the coming days.
The house is a set up. They are going to record and document what happens, who turns up, does anyone break in etc. Then they will come clean and report their findings.
That's my gut feeling right now. I have spent a lot of time analysing text, and this article reads like a conspiracy theory/truther article. I'm sure it's bait.
