Because you're a moron for putting literally 100% of your income into a volatile currency.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:01:25
I think shorting only applies to futures trading, and the average joe doesn't "short" bitcoin.
The term I use instead is "day trading", or even "swing trading" if you try to buy at daily/weekly minima and sell at daily/weekly maxima rather than trading multiple times per day
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:53:03
Yup, you should only use Coinbase if you have zero funds in your account and you desperately want to make a purchase using a debit/credit card rather than waiting for a deposit to go through to GDAX. You have to pay hefty fees on Coinbase, so stick with GDAX if possible.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:16:08
That's the thing. GDAX says deposits take 2-4 business days. I've been waiting since Friday for a $50.00 deposit, so I should get that money tomorrow. I've had deposits take more than 4 business days, though.
Your only option for immediate purchasing, as far as I know of, is Coinbase. You just make a purchase using debit, credit, or anything else. Coinbase charges a 1% to ~5% free depending on how much you buy, with the fee decreasing as you purchase more.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:21:51
Oh, okay thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:01:07
What if Reddit somehow started an international holiday focused on decentralized wealth and welfare for those in need, preferably with an emphasis on Bitcoin... Damn, one can only dream.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:07:52
Coinbase takes a fee on buying and selling, but GDAX takes no fee as long as you use Limit orders. Learn about limit orders.
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:52:50
Gemini also lets you purchase coins immediately, but you have to wait a long time for them to verify your account.
You can purchase coins on Coinbase at market price with your bank account. You'll get your coins locked in at the price, so you basically get your BTC immediately. Only problem is the massive fees.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:06:16
Login to GDAX once you've signed up, and there's a button near the top-left that says "Deposit". You can choose "Bank Account" and deposit directly from your checking account. That's the easiest option, and credit/debit is not an option here.

Use the iOS app caller Coin Stats for instantaneous notifications, similar to Coinbase but faster.

Serious question: what happens if you lose your iPhone?
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:16:18
Isn't that technically bad advice, since savings is naturally "safe" and investments are naturally "risky"?
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:52:56
Jokes on you, all of my sales are losses so they owe *me* money.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:39:06
You just need coinbase, but after you make you learn about GDAX, you should really start using that as it has no transaction fees. Coinbase owns and operates the GDAX exchange. Message me if you've got questions, I was a newbie 2 weeks ago and now I'm day trading like it's no big deal :)
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:29:27
Oh.... Whoosh.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:14:48
Because by the time we see a $6,000 dip, that might bring us back down to $12,000 but no where near the previous $6,000 dip. Waiting for a dip seems more and more irresponsible as the hours pass.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:06:02
May I ask why?
I'm the proud owner of 1% of 1 Bitcoin :D
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:42:09
Be richer than the asshole who's causing the price manipulation.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:59:27
No there has not. They're just paranoid that another Mt. Gox incident will happen and millions of bitcoins will disappear.
I have all of my BTC on Coinbase. *Sue me.*
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:59:46
But then again, this 1,200₿ wall fell down in under about 20 minutes after the price matched $17250 for a few solid minutes. So maybe selling 10,000₿ wouldn't be too big of a deal?
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:56:18
Same, friend. Same.
(I'm also an iOS dev)

OP: "Fuck money."
OP: "Money saved my life and cured my anxiety!"
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:50:57
What... why would you do that?
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:47:33
To build off of this question, are tiny currencies like ReeCoin just memes or are they actual cryptocurrencies that have complex technology behind them? Do people use these currencies for anything?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:15:44
I would if you were valuable enough to HODL.

I LOVE these logos! People are saying it's impossible to tell it's a B, but even if it's subtle that's good enough. Perhaps you can make the B slightly more prominent by adding a rounded curve on top like the bottom, but I don't know if it's necessary or if that takes away from the design.
The color choices are fantastic.
I want that logo printed on a shirt so I can wear it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:04:30
I only had a little bit of money in my bank account but I went ahead and invested a couple hundred. I feel like that's enough where if the money quadruples and I get a $800 ROI, I'll be pretty happy, and if I happen to lose all $200, I'll be fine with that as well. It's a win-win kind of deal. If I invest any more, then I'll start panicking.
I think the trick is to invest *as much as possible* up to the point where you feel it would be financially crippling to invest any more. If it's chump change for you, invest $1,000. If $1,000 would set you back months in savings, then invest a 10th that.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:47:19
So should I be buying BTC on bitfinex and then sending the BTC to GDAX for selling?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:54:57
Good point. I wonder what it would take to cause a scare where more than 1% of all BTC to be sold at once. I don't understand Bitcoin well enough to say whether I would sell out or keep hodling, but I hope there would be some chance of recovery after such an event.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:28:23
Where did it drop below 13k today? I know it didn't on GDAX, because I have a limit buy set at exactly $13,001.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:16:30
Can someone ELIF what this lightning network is? Are we getting a new coin called Bitcoin Lightning or is this a new exchange or crazy advanced technology or something?
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:15:00
I'm an actual programmer; should I be helping lightning in some way?
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:44:06
I want to switch to Gemini but it seems like it's lacking all of the useful features on GDAX.
For example, how do you view candlesticks, auto set a limit order by clicking on how much USD you currently have or how much you want the BTC to sell for?
And how do you live without a native iOS or Android app? I find it useful sometimes.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:49:26
I have better luck with GDAX for up to date information, since Coinbase goes down all the time. GDAX usually goes down at the same time, but it's slightly more stable at least.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:19:45
Isn't the best course of action to continue having kids on an annual basis to average the cost over a much longer period of time?
EDIT: Don't forget to sell the kids also!
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:31:17
So, did OP send you 1BTC for $1? :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:36:52
But I need muh Bitcoin price updated every second. :(
Just kidding, cheers. That's all really helpful information.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:21:55
Do your Coinbase notifications come in right away or are they unreliable, like mine are?
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:24:32
I have to admit, I'm a programmer and I don't even know where this code goes. Is there a manual scripts section on Better Touch Tool? I need to re-download this app.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:54:13
No one knows whether the price will go up or down, but it's likely that futures will cause the price to either rise or fall thousands of dollars in a matter of minutes or hours strictly due to the increase in trading volume. I suspect the price will go down immediately, but then back up over the next few days, but no one knows...
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:48:55
What's wrong with Coinbase, besides the negative press over supporting Bcash?
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:25:55
Oh, so telling people a super precise number is dangerous, but it's probably fine to tell someone you own roughly 0.0000001 bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:29:50
I sure hope you and I are right about this prediction. I feel precisely the same way. I can't imagine this "dip" is over before the end of 2017.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:17:33
I think you mean green is for hodl and red is for bitcoin sales.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:03:55
How do you calculate one deviation from the mean? I know what standard deviation is, but what is the mean you are referring to? The average cost of bitcoin across all the different exchanges?
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:23:16
Leave it on GDAX (Coinbase Exchange) until you have more than a few hundred $ worth of BTC, since it costs money to withdraw to a hardware wallet. You have to have enough BTC to withdraw for it to be worth the cost.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:49:40
Ah okay, interesting.
To me it looks like Apple tried to take the pseudo-english SQL language and made it even more annoying to use.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:29:14
The site is not sketchy, just cover the webcam if you are paranoid but other than that GDAX is considered safe and the best option for serious trading.
@_date: 2018-09-08 06:56:07
Do you think there will be elective courses in universities that go over the structure of a meme? Like a poem class, but with more memes.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:12:30
I mean, "storing" bitcoin in a safety deposit box at a bank is not the same as using the bank to store money. They can't actually use your money or trade with it, or lose it on accident, or whatever. I think people hate banks because they profit off of your money when you're not using it. Personally I don't give a shit.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:40:53
I'm sorry, but what? Moore's law is a theoretical doubling of the number of transistors every 1.5 years according to Gordon Moore (creator of Intel Corp), which has nothing to do with Bitcoin and is no longer relevant to computer science either, as of a few years ago.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:31:32
Thanks man, super cool!
Is there a limit to API calls or is GDAX free forever?

Probably just a string of 24 words.

Why does it say All Time High if the price was over $8,000 just days ago?
@_date: 2019-10-09 20:10:35
Can someone ELIF what kind of change he might have made? I know what a pull request is.
Why does Bitcoin need to be updated? Did OP rewrite one of the algorithms, or update some code syntax, or just add a comment since the code is already done?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:04:03
I was waiting for the dip but I figured I'd buy in at $10,000 just in case the dip is a lie.
Although if it does dip, I can still invest even more and ride the rocket from there.
@_date: 2018-03-03 00:07:03
Hey let me know if you still need help with this. I've got a pretty robust AppleScript for my Bitcoin ticker.
