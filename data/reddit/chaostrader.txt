Here's a short list of places/companies that accept Bitcoin:
@_date: 2019-07-13 01:07:54
Buy .28 Bitcoin and when the last Bitcoin is mined, it is entirely within the realm of possibility that you will be in the top 1% of all Bitcoin owners.
@_date: 2019-07-20 22:52:23
I pulled out of Binance as well. I also trade on Bittrex and Kucoin and have had good experiences with both. Bittrex has a lot of pairings,  but at this time has no mobile app. So mobile trading can be clunky. I like Kucoin because they have some of the less known Alt coins that aren't on major exchanges yet.
@_date: 2019-07-20 22:55:03
The common opinion is that miners will turn to transaction fees for their income and that will keep the network going.

I've used several mobile wallets including: Enjin, Jaxx, Ethos, O3, and Trust Wallet. I finally settled on Infinito Wallet because it offers multi-chain support. I like all my currencies in one place. Infinito supports, BTC, ETH, NEO, EOS, CARDANO, and many ERC20 tokens. I love not having to download and manage multiple wallet apps for each currency. I hold Cardano, NEO, BTC, ETH, EOS, and ETC. Because these were all separate chains I had to have four different wallet apps to store them on my mobile. A huuuge pain in the ass. Now they all live in one place and I only have to worry about protecting one set of keys. Hope this helps. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 11:27:23
Bittrex and Binance. Both have never been hacked, have high liquidity, and hundreds of coins/tokens. 
@_date: 2019-08-18 09:25:02
Coinbase. I do it all the time never had a problem. Instant as long as you stay within your withdrawal limit. Limits depend on KYC level. I know there are some who will disagree, but Coinbase is a bout as secure as you can get when it comes to centralized exchanges.

During the 1970's there was a fad called "The Pet Rock." The marketing  genius behind it all became a millionaire selling rocks in boxes as "Pets." In that case 1 Rock = it's portion of the millions he sold to idiots like me. So, you might say 1 Rock = 1 Rock, unless of course, people  declare it valuable and will pay money for it. It is the same with gold.

Have you considered using something like Bitpay or Crypto.com cards? They do require KYC and if you are looking to avoid that then probably not good options. But if not, it's basically like using a credit card except your line of credit is linked to your Bitcoin deposits.

Thank you Sir for taking the time to share your knowledge! I'll definitely be moving to an RBF wallet!
@_date: 2019-06-01 13:37:43
I've used Coinbase since I entered the space a year ago. It is one of the most secure "hot wallets" (meaning your crypto is not stored offline in "cold storage" and you do not own your own keys) out there. While "cold storage' is ideal (using a hardware wallet like Nano X or Trezor) because you control your own keys and your funds are not on an exchange, Coinbase is probably one of the most secure (they've never been hacked) exchanges out there. They also insure the funds in their hot wallet against loss due to security breaches and technical issues. However, the absolutely most safest route is to never leave your funds on an exchange. You want to withdraw them to a wallet to which you own the private keys. But if you are going to leave them on an exchange, Coinbase is probably the safest place to do so. As for your plan to buy a set amount each week? I think that is smart. The majority of people lose when trying to time the market.

I have used just about every mobile wallet there is and I have settled on Infinito Wallet. It is a true universal wallet in that it supports not only Bitcoin but multiple other chains such as NEO, EOS, Cardano, and ETH to name a few. They also have an outstanding air drop program.
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:56:19
Thank you! I will check it out!
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:08:41
Got to pay to play! What's your risk tolerance? Even the most conservative of investors place a small portion of their portfolio in high risk/high return investments. Maybe consider 25-50% instead of the whole thing? You can always buy in later if things look good. In my humble and amateur opinion any buy in under $20k is a good risk. But then I am just a regular guy like you. Research some more (Reddit is not research) so you will feel confident in whatever decision you make. Best of luck! May the crypto gods smile upon you!
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:14:17
Ah I wish I had an RBF wallet. I do now! Thanks!

How you get the Bitcoin doesn't matter. It's the value it has and retains that does. Bitcoin is entirely capable of retaining value in and of itself. There will come a day when it's value is not derived from the value of fiat. That is my opinion.

Even though it's in the billions, Bitcoin and Crypto's market cap as a whole are relatively small compared to traditional capital markets. This makes it far easier for one, or a group of Bitcoin holders with a substantial amount of funds to push the market around. Artificial buy/sell orders can be made on retail exchanges (by artificial I mean the makers have no intent of fulfilling them) and cancelled, but not before a certain hysteria starts to develop among the members of the exchange. A buying or selling frenzy then ensues,  and you have your artificial bull/bear run. This is a vastly oversimplified answer to your question and there may be others who can flesh out more detail or correct any errors I have made. I'm just a regular guy like you who has seen it happen several times. It's the best sense I've been able to make of it.

It was the next major price resistance level according to many trading chart analysts. People took profits on the run at that point.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:16:11
If you are interested in Alt Coins you might want to consider looking at the following: Enjin (BTC, LTC, ETH and ETH tokens), Infinito (BTC, LTC, ETH, EOS, NEO, CARDANO), Jaxx (BTC, LTC, DASH,VL ICX, ETH, et Al.). I've used all if them and really loved Infinito due to its cross chain comparability, however it was a little slow and buggy. Jaxx is about the smoothest UI and most user friendly. Enjin is the one I currently use. I like it's security features, and stability. Anyway, some for you to check out. All available from Play Store.

You make an excellent point. My side hustle is selling on Amazon and eBay. The growth there is crazy and it isn't predicted to slow down anytime soon. I'd love to see one or both of them start to accept Bitcoin,  but for now I am not holding my breath. If I had to guess who will first I'd have to say eBay.

Yeah... Ive tried to pretend I'm some big time trader and "time the market." I lose every time. If you believe BTC will be worth more than it is now in 1,2,5,10 years time, then your buys are very smart. It's an important psychological difference.

Been in this space for two years AND I made money today, so no worries about being poor. If you could pull your ignorant melon out of your pompous ass long enough, you might have realized this post was a sardonic commentary on the brighter side of higher fees and slower transactions. Both being indicative of the type of volume we were seeing in December of 2017. But you'd rather spew nonsense out of you stinking, gaping piehole. Get a life.

Institutional investors buy over-the-counter. Retail prices will not increase until retail investors start buying again. Hopefully institutional investment will create enough awareness to stimulate the retail market and trigger another bull run.

Enjin for me. Not open source but then I am not a programmer so what would that mean to me anyway? I'd have to trust that the people coding for the open source wallet knew what they were doing and were being held accountable. It would make no sense for Enjin to insert malicious code into their wallet and screw over their users. It would be like Webroot or McAfee Security intentionally inserting malicious code into their security programs. Why would they do that? 
That being said, I use Enjin because a Nano Ledger is costing $150 to $300 on Amazon. The affordable versions are on back order for months. With Enjin I posess my private keys. The wallet supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, et al, as well as any ECR 20 token. With exception of NEO, I am able to keep all my coins in one place. Before, I had three or four wallets to handle them all.  Maybe I'm a sucker but Enjin does the trick for me and I sleep well at night.

The woman from the Fed said there was no insurance for crypto funds. HORSESHIT! Not on many exchanges but t hgt ere are wallets such as Coinbase, Nexo, and Celsius, to name a few that are insured.
