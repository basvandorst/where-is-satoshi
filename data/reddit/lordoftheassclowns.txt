You know that's a **lot** harder than just abandoning the bail money right?
@_date: 2018-05-29 00:00:21
Actually they did.  Unfortunately then 10x more people got introduced to cryptocurrencies, so we went back to 90% of the market not understanding this.

Might as well call me a nazi while you're at it.

No, we should be worried about **this:**


Stupid fucking fucks.

It's called being realistic.
And yes, reality is the shit.

**DON'T (try to) INSTALL THE APK (which is blacklisted anyways)**
Bitpay announcement that the version linked above, released on 13-November, was among the first that were backdoored:
Thief dumped the coins and is now fiat-rich.
The three weird, sudden, downward price spikes probably correspond to his malware harvesting some poor schmuck's 10kBTC-key.  Or maybe just him waking up and harvesting a hundred 100BTC keys.  The malware was cleverly programmed to ignore anybody with less than 100BTC.

@_date: 2018-11-27 05:40:35
Well at least we know where the bitcoin plunge came from now.  Hacker has dumped the stolen coins and is fiat-rich.
@_date: 2018-11-27 07:37:25
It never was fine.
@_date: 2018-11-27 08:35:25
[Now we know why the price crashed on November 14th (look at release date)](
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:12:26
Irresistible, high value target for backdoorings.
The damn things are designed for only one purpose: to hold valuable shit.  How stupid can you be?
@_date: 2018-11-27 08:26:19
Actually you said I was "making this shit up"
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:19:38


The thief believes otherwise.  Do you think he'd code it to target only wallets with more than 100BTC if he didn't believe there were a lot of them?
Rich people do stupid stuff.  Not always involving lambos and John McAffee.
@_date: 2018-11-27 07:24:44


So did copay.  Here's where they committed a file containing the hashes of malware-laden upstream packages:
Stuff like Cargo.lock doesn't address the problem.  Standard operating procedure is to blindly pull in the latest version of 1400 packages, run your regression tests, use it a while, sign it and call it a day.
The symptom is 1400 dependencies.
The problem is a **failure to value simplicity**.
Hashes can't fix that problem.
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:13:20
Yeah they actually GPG-signed a backdoored release.  The malware has their signature on it, quite literally.
@_date: 2018-11-27 08:16:30
No, I'm not.  Here, wade through all the [proof](
Edit: even [MOAR](
Seriously, bitpay itself only figured out what happened ten hours ago.  Anybody who got robbed, and whoever or whatever authority they might have reported it to, was still trying to figure out WTF happened until today.  The last thing they would do is plaster it all over reddit.
The hack reports will start being made public this week.  Be patient.

And now we know why the price collapsed out of nowhere on November 14th: [ELI5](
@_date: 2018-11-27 07:38:35


Actually only since -- at the very earliest -- October 26th.  But unless you built your own package from github you wouldn't have recieved it until November 8th (version 5.0.2) or November 13th (version 5.0.8).
And bitcoin crashed on November 14th because (tautologically) somebody dumped a bunch of coins.
Gee, I wonder.
Edit: fix dates.
Edit: reading some of the user's comments it looks like version 5.0.2 had a bug that prevented it from starting up completely.  So really version 5.0.8 on November 13th really was the first time the malware was shipped in a form that could have been used.  And the next day somebody dumps a ton of coins in a hurry.
Edit: Google Play Store irritatingly displays absolutely bupkus about old versions of apps.  For the release timeline see [this](

It ~~can~~ frequently does happen to banks too if their e-banking web-client is compromised.
What yonder post upthread is *really* complaining about is that bitcoin doesn't come with a bailout mechanism.  That's a feature, not a bug.
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:17:29


Well [duh](  That's the news story.  Actually it links to a page that links to a page that links to malware.  Like a lot of posts do.
I tried to find this release (with a verified date) on the Google Play Store but they don't have any history except the latest version.  Shame on them.
In any case, the APK has already been blacklisted by Google's malware signature database.  Nobody's gonna install it because I linked to the only release history I could find.
@_date: 2018-11-27 08:30:31
Bitpay has just [announced that they are investigating]( reports of the exploit's use.

Good.  Your grandmother should never adopt wallets written in javascript.  Nobody should adopt wallets written in javascript.  Except maybe John McAffee.

Code review is nice, but it doesn't fix the *failure to value simplicity* either.
