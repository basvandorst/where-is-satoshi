I'm having the same issue did you ever find the solution to this error??

I emailed them and they just really told me what I already know. Its really frustrating since btc is almost at record breaking prices. I replied back with a screenshot of all my address variations in hopes that they come to a solution.






**EDIT** OMG I got it to work! I tried so many variations of my physical address and post office box number so I just tried "POB3" and it went through! Hope this helps anyone with the issue, good luck!

I'm instant verified and i just bought some like 15 minutes ago except they didn't show up in my account. Now coinbase is down and the price of bitcoin is spiraling down......

yeah you gotta try a lot of variations of your address and if you have post office box try POB then the number immediately after without a space.

I wish I read this before I just tried verifying for the 10000th time. Hopefully this will fix my issue!
