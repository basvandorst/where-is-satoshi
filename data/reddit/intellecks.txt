I wonder too. In a technologically innovative environment where middle men are removed and costs of services/goods decrease dramatically,  the subsequent taxable gross revenues also decrease. 
I ask why because.. why gov't? In some techno-utopia, any thing that a local community would need could be voted upon/crowdfunded in real time, at a fair rate, and transparently. The politicians , who are currently middle-men between public need and procurement of services to fulfill the need, would no longer be needed in most cases.

Imagine a world where every community or business has an exchangeable digital asset/blockchain-based token. You play world of warcraft and receive a little WoWcoin, you might drive for uberCoin, you might work for your CompanyCoin. Each of those coins have utility value for their own networks and are freely tradeable digital assets - A service like shapeshift could be the centerpiece in a situation where you want to buy food: convert WoWgold -&gt; BTC -&gt; vendor -&gt; food. Or on vendor side: WoWgold -&gt;Vendor -&gt; convert to currency of choice. Like an automatic google translate for currency, where vendor can receive in whatever they want and the system converts any incoming payment type to their preference in real time.They wouldn't even care at all what their original currency is..  Not a novel thought I admit, but shapeshift-like solution are one step closer to this.

Ok, I understand. I'm going to do some more research on my own too. One other idea is that they truly want to secure the future of bitcoin by distributing on a mass scale. Obviously, Billions of miners are much hard to shut down that 10,000. Having a myriad of other services based on BTC means that they are truly incentivized to ensure its success on a fundamental level.

Do you have plans for a decentralized wallet? How is your web wallet protected from censorship/ attacks based on its centralized nature? Already features are unavailable / censored (can't buy XCP from US for example). 
How will you be able to compete if a similar, decentralized solution arises? 
Do you see this as your strength or weakness.
This message from your web wallet is no bueno and leads one to seek alternatives:
"It appears that you are located in a country in which we are legally unable to provide this service. If legal to do so in your country, you can purchase XCP from one of the centralized exchanges listed here."

This crash will force alt coiners to trade back into BTC as alts follow BTCs lead psychologically, up and down. They will learn their lesson and convert back to long BTC HODLrs due to their emotional investment in crypto. The smartest and most valuable of these will understand that focused effort on BTC is the only way and begin drinking the Nakamoto kool aid again. Many of them will actually start to create some value for BTC community. Those who are currently truly vested in BTC's success - not traders or miners IMO - the developers, inventors, marketers will work harder than ever to to build adoption mechanisms,  because trading/mining doesn't mean shit to adoption and adoption is the end game. Bitcoin proves itself to be antifragile yet again after this wave and adoption boons with further outside investment and incentivized mechanisms for widespread adoption arises. Nothing can stop an IDEA whose time has come.

The one project I have been organizing out of my brain and onto paper is a streaming music protocol that has juke-box/prepay feature .. entities , whether they be end users or other apps that run on it and resell/redistribute,  can prepay for play time and get x amount of seconds of playtime per unit of payment. cost per playtime will be dynamic based on storage and streaming costs.
95% of payments go directly to artists, who are assigned a btc address that is tied to their contributions. Can even pre-populate big artists and have their money in reserve for when they claim it. Artists get paid in real time, so if someone listens to 5 seconds of their song, they'll get paid out when that listening session is over.  
Can build consensus system for authorizing artists based on community voting/approval.
Two payment modes: 
One is standard where credits sit in account if unused and can be manually refunded/transferred out. Another mode is auto-refund, where user puts in say $1 of value, but if they do not use it up in a session. After listening session ends and some time goes by, the credits are refunded back to original address.
Remaining 5% goes to dev team. Trying to make the value proposition VERY artist friendly and not be greedy there. Artists are sick of losing large % of their revenue to itunes cuts, distro cuts, label cuts.. Disintermediate these.
Client app : maybe zeroNet with angularjs
Storage: probably use a platform like Storj.io
Goal is to be 100% DAC, 100% crypto

We were even thinking of buying higher powered wifi repeaters like [ubiquity]( and putting some on rooftops of buildings in urban areas. However your crowd approach is much better.  For the identity/liability  part, you can always show that someone with a BTC adress of XYZ was accessing the hotspot at a given time if any nefarious things were going on.

If no runup happens this time, I have a hunch that the last runup of BTC price during the previous Greek situation was either uncorrelated or it was manufactured a la Willy bot or other manipulator at the time per some theories I've looked into.

 Ah I gotcha I misread / misunderstood until you provided example.
Yea that's a tough one. 
With appropriate publicly available data, an incentivised userbase + app algos can monitor for fraudulent trends and flag users for investigation in real time... i.e. same two people involved in multiple claims, frequent claims by one person... basically scan for outliers for some type of review. 
I don't think it's as productive to try to remove all fraud: probably want to think of it more in terms of a set of mitigation tactics to keep costs manageable.
At some point its still just two people, in the real world, making a deal...The experienced owner will be able to reduce his perception of risk through requiring whatever info he or she needs to make the judgement call, or adjust his costs accordingly to accommodate risk. 
The platform should just facilitate the transaction better than what's currently available. I think when you go down the rabbit hole of edge cases it can distract from vision.

No. Totally wrong. For adoption we need to create services and products with experiences that blow everything else out of the water, and make BTC the only payment mechanism  AVERAGE JOE can operate it with. IMO that's the only way you get people to demand to utilize the currency.

The benefit of the vaccine is that you don't get the disease.. if you don't take the vaccine, you get the disease. Think of it this way: let's LET idiots get sick and die if they don't want to take the vaccine (assuming they all work). That would fit right along with abortion stance as well. How could one be FOR a mothers medical right to choose to abort and AGAINST a mother's right to vaccinate herself or not?

I think the arbitration/ confirmation would be better done on a larger scale than just "hey you two guys come arbitrate our claim issue here". I imagine hundreds of participants voting on the claim to find consensus on the issue. 
Any claim would want to provide as much evidence as possible: images, records, communications(all blockchain verified of course) . Then the true jury of peers would vote on the evidence to reach a judgement on whether to release insurance funds and in what amount. Kind of like blockchain consensus.
Fraud could be caught by the peers and trigger punitive measures in the form of blocking participation on the network for a period of time or something similar.

Like, the app should do the BEST job possible into exposing risks to both parties up front before an agreement, and still allow for their individual judgement and risk tolerance.

I'm going to assume the primary incentive is to enable their hardware technology to have advanced features enabled by blockchain tech which wouldn't be possible otherwise. They incur the cost of the btc/whatever-chain transfers as a 'loss leader' to acheive higher order value to customers and their network of devices.

Well from now until the next halving, supply is fixed at a constant inflation of approx. 3,600 BTC/day.  If you believe deflation is a reduction in money supply, then a deflation event only occurs at halvings. And true deflation of BTC only occurs when all bitcoins are mine.

Don't forget, amazon affiliate program pays out 4%+ on gross revenue from purchases made through affiliate links. Higher volume gets higher % commission.
EDIT: [LINK Amazon Affiliate Program]( They can get up to 10% with high volume. If they give you 3% cash back or whatever, they keep the spread and make 7% on whatever you purchase on amazon. If you buy a $1000 TV, they get $100 and give you $30, netting them $70. Similar to many online affiliate/rev-share models a lot of the cash back/rewards programs offer.

Insurance could be built into a decentralized solution.. maybe a part of participation requires hosts to pay network insurance fee and the risk is shared among all hosts. Or, like credit scores, the renter may pay a premium for low reputation &amp; that dynamic premium could be added to the network insurance fund in r/t. But who is then the arbiter to determine if your stolen/broken goods claim is legit? The platform might have to develop a crowdsourced/incentived claims review system on top of it where independent claims reviewers could 'confirm' claims for reward..OR , the hosts would be the arbiters and consensus among hosts on a claim would release insurance to the owner.

Whats cool is that you could have a receive address that's not on your phone/not on your person which you can watch the transaction go to. This way you can see that someone made a payment without actually having the bitcoin with you. No opportunity to rob you in person.

I believe nation states rely upon taxed, inefficient, captured markets to exist. They can not change laws fast enough to adapt and retain tax revenue streams in the state of flux that things like Uber are causing.
Cheaper services = less revenue to apply taxation upon
Distributed services =  harder to apply taxation laws (too many people doing it, not enough audit resources to go after smaller, distributed money base) = less revenue to apply taxation upon
Direct services = remove middleman inefficiencies and middleman's revenue = less revenue to apply taxation upon
Technological advances &amp; automation= less waste, more efficiency, less energy use both in terms of human resources &amp; fuel &amp; materials = less revenue to apply taxation upon
These are compounding factors that the next generation of distributed p2p direct service platforms like Uber, airBNB, and bitcoin are applying or will start applying across all economies. Every single piece of how traditional economies work is going to be flipped on it's head.
IMO Uber is the absolute key for general public to understand the value proposition of these platforms - it shows them in a visceral way how pseudonymous, p2p, crowdsourced, distributed, reputation-based concepts benefit themselves, the given market,  and their fellow man (the uber driver).  Cheaper, faster, better experience, better feels. Absolute paradigm shift.
I'm no expert: how do nation states deal with finding ways of new tax revenue in an environment of such rapid movement? I don't know how they will. 
If private services become this much cheaper, the tech should slowly trickle into gov'ts, which then could reduce the cost of gov't services (and hopefully require less tax revenue for funding)
This is going to be interesting to watch. The people are voting with their money, and by that I mean they are directly participating in decreasing the financial power of nation states by choosing to use better, more efficient services.   I dare say this is the most interesting time in history. So complex, so ripe for change.
This is stuff that revolutions are made of.. I hope it is Velvet.

Concern-trolling. You have taught me a new word and today and I also learned from you that somewhere, someone thinks the word "deserve" means "to demand". Fascinating stuff. Thanks for your thoughtful insights. I appreciate you educating me. Thank you, I can now leave the conversation!

I think it is a possibility that a single purchase tax would work. While the gov't may have a hard time controlling its individual citizens due to sheer mass, it can more easily control taxation at point-of-sale where there are fewer endpoints. An additional side effect might be that with more disposable income, reliance on consumer credit would be reduced.
EDIT: But think about throwing 3D printing and food replication into the mix - something I think will more common in 15-20 years - you'll make all of your goods in the home so you're really only ever purchasing bulk amounts of elements and getting your goods more efficiently. That takes a huge chunk of cost out of this taxable revenue from purchases of goods. 
So if gov't can't grow revenue from taxation on services, and they can't get more revenue on purchase of goods, what's does a gov't do? 
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:00:41
But you agree that demanding something is more powerful than claiming you deserve it? That is the context in which my statement was made, not whether it should be done or not.

@_date: 2015-02-01 02:05:19
That is a valid point. My perception is that as the tax revenue declines, the beast starves more quickly than it can find food, and they will be forced to find efficiencies. They simply won't be able to grab enough money from the populace.
Potential options for by gov'ts :
* They print money to match the loss in revenue to pay for their projects and devalue their currency out of existence.
* They ban the software(s) from use.
* They adopt the tech and save the monies
* Increase the rate of taxation
* Build new, high-tech tax system to accommodate
I believe they will print, as that is the quickest /most effective way for them to combat, that won't cause waves of discontent amongst the populace because, frankly, 99% of people don't know or care about the printing. That's one of the reasons I don't see as bright a future for state currencies as we know them.
 
EDIT: After reading [THIS RESOLUTION]( , I believe they won't print. They are planning on stealing.
