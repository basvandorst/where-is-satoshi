If I wanted to work that hard for 300 bucks, I'd have an honest profession.

What are these non-judicial methods I can pursue to get my money? The way I see it, his personal assets would be forfeit if my private strike team can take out his guards and make off with them/him.

Because, being a top result in google, it was getting in the way of their scamming.

But then you have to pay for the prison that the scammer is in, and that's like being robbed a second time. Best just to hire your own PMC and have him capped.

You lost me there. Please answer these two questions so I can understand where you're coming from:
In a proper (ideal) free market...
1. Why would he not be able to use the money he took from MtGox to hire a security firm? 
2. Why would this security firm be blacklisted by insurance companies for protecting an unpopular person that people want to kill? This is what security firms that handle VIPs do, after all.
As for your final point, you could certainly try to bribe guards to have access to Mark. What others have mentioned and I'm still not clear on is how hiring or running your own spy agency/PMC to get your money back is a superior alternative to the system currently in place.

You're a little misinformed. Using a non-airgapped WinXP computer in an enterprise or home setting is a security vulnerability, and it's only a matter of time before something bad happens. I think it's just good business sense to avoid the problem by upgrading. However, most ATMs actually use Embedded XP, which will still receive updates for another year or two.

As CVLT said, they don't have a valid case. None of those lawsuits would survive a motion to dismiss. It won't get terribly expensive, and if the lawsuit is deemed frivolous the plaintiff may have to cover his legal fees.

So once the guy takes my bitcoins I can have him and/or his family murdered to get it back? Where do I sign up for this libertarian paradise?
