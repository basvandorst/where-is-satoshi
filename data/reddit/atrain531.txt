What's the easiest place I can buy bitcoin at? I like coinbase because I can link my bank account hahaha. My long term view is that bitcoin will rule the world, so I intend to hold until I am filthy rich. I wonder if I can convince my employer to start paying me in bitcoin...

Hmm I was thinking this as well. Currently, my IRA is invested in bitcoin but I was thinking in terms of trade fees and capital gains taxes. I don't think the exchanges are required to report ur gains to the IRS like the brokerages are. Also, the trade fees for a broker could be 5 dollars no matter the size of the trade, whereas coinbase will charge you a % which could amount to a lot more than 5 dollars. I do not care about liquidity as this is for investment purposes. I am a CPA and this would be for a regular brokerage account, not a tax advantaged account

Hmm ok. I guess the bigger coinbase fee would be justified due to the lower price I would be able to get

What does this mean? Ur saying my custodian like Charles Schwab could lose my gbtc shares? I don't think this is the case. Would coinbase be able to protect my shares? All my bitcoin is on coinbase or on my IRA account with scottrade, aka GBTC shares
