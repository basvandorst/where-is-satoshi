I would also suggest signing a message using the [sign message functionality of Electron Cash]( using the address you enclosed in the disclosure. That would convince all the doubters for sure.

Be careful with swap contracts like the one you used on BCH, they can be used to steal funds during the swap. My understanding is that lightning network has a contract-enforced secret size, but your BCH contract does not. That's a big problem -- the LN coin owner can steal from the BCH coin owner, if the LN owner is the one who picks the secret!
Details here: 
Another bit of self promo on atomic swaps... tell your swap software provider to do the BCH side in a payment channel! You can conceal the swap and also you don't end up freely giving someone a big free option that lasts until expiry time.

That site is completely broken. Note that it says the total size of unconfirmed transactions is 4 GB.
Use this site instead: 
Or this one:

In the end, this is precisely what is happening on ZCash. [
So, it's fair to say that bitcoin with extension blocks can achieve equivalent functionality to ZCash.

Atomic swaps leave a quite obvious trace on the blockchain -- the hash lock, which is unique to the swap (and appears on both chains).

Hmm, that is unfortunate, I didn't realize the negative scores were having an effect like this. I do find your posts to have more of a nagging 'told you so' tone than is really necessary, but it's not trolling and I don't think you should be ratelimited.

Sweeping UTXOs is by definition batching -- many inputs, one output.
When he says "It takes 147 bytes to spend" he's referring to the bytes per (signature (70 bytes) + pubkey (33 bytes) + prevtxid (32 bytes) + misc) when included in a batched transaction.

You're asking the equivalent of moving all the money on the kitchen table to always be stored under the mattress.

Adoption may have only fallen by ~20% to cause the fees to fall so drastically. 
Underfull blocks = basically free transactions
Full blocks = arbitrarily expensive transactions
In other words, we might have just been 10% over the capacity to cause such a spike, and now that we're 10% under capacity then everything is smooth.
It should be just another two months before adoption rises again to the threshold of spiking fees, judging from the past:

With that site ( it's best to always include the raw, unsmoothed "value per block" by clicking on it. Then you would have seen that it was just a temporary spike to 60% that happened for the blocks around block 511280. It'll now return to around 20-25%.

If you want to get a picture of what's going on, take a look at these sites:
* 
* 
*  (click on 'Outputs' tab)
* 
Also try to pick out at random some of those transactions ( has a nice chart you can click on) to get a micro picture.

Yes, lightning is a great way to avoid chain analysis right now since AFAIK nodes to not log the money that is being transmitted through them nor do they perform KYC/AML checks.

Came here to say this, lol. Those pizzagate guys go frothing at the mouth over anything with pizza and two hearts / two triangles / two whatevers (two scoops?).

FWIW I considered public signature aggregation but I consider it to be too complex to do safely right now, and there's nothing wrong with waiting until later -- my reasoning here: [
And, all it wins is some block space. I have a feeling that it's not worth the bother...
(Maybe some time savings in validation too, but it's not immediately obvious to me how MuSig derivation squares up against just doing batch verification.)
