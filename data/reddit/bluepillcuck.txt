You really don't know this to be true. It is very possible the peak was reached and it will never fully recover. Not being a jerk, just saying that you may be holding on to the Titanic. That's cool if you're fine with that, I hold crypto, but you are deluding yourself and others if you think this statement is a given. It's really not. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:38:03
I really can't tell if you are serious or not. Regardless, this is a terrible idea.

Source? Like what? Do you mean actual blockchain?

1) That's a pretty big difference with real world implications. 
2) It's not the only difference. Prior to mid-2017, the majority of people in crypto were techies/hardcore libertarians/hacker/etc types. Last year, your dad bought some bitcoin to play with in his portfolio. 
3) Prior to late-2017/now, the majority of people in crypto and bitcoin specifically had not lost much of their original investment, and certainly not hundreds and thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars. The exception being people that bought at the height of the run to 1000... those people lost money, I bet many never came back. This time around, there may be no one else willing to come back. There might be, I could see one more run up, but it is certainly not guaranteed.

1 USD is still worth 1USD. What's your point?

Do you get the coins instantly if you use a debit/cc? I've been waiting a week this whole time for nothing? What is the charge, 3%? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:40:27
3% on top of what they already take is far from negligible, but it is still good to know. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:46:01
Do you really believe this? 
Just look at this sub. People are clearly buying out of speculation. I hold cryptos--it is entirely speculative beyond its use on darknet markets. It also has a use as a curb against inflation, but even that depends on its speculative value. This is the truth of the vast majority of people buying, even most of those pretending that it is for the revolution. Maybe you aren't one of those people.... 99% of people are. 
You are deluding yourself if you think the price isn't based on speculation and people hoping to just sell it for higher.

Dude, I really don't care that much. Feel free to believe what you want. 
Bottom line for me: PoW uses a ridiculous amount of electricity. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:54:05


Actually, sorry, yes this is wrong. I was misremembering it as .8% global (before the peaks even) and rounding up because it has gone up since, but that is actually of US consumption. My mistake. 
It's actually a little over .2% of global consumption.  This is still and insanely high number and is more electricity that smaller European countries like Ireland use. 
So yes I misspoke, but the sentiment is the same. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:12:12
Dude, come on. Apples and oranges. Banks are doing a lot more work than what bitcoin is doing. A single person with a $200 laptop and a copy of MS Excel can do what Bitcoin does, I can barely program and I could probably write a program to automate what Bitcoin does, minus all of the infrastructure needed to keep it decentralized. PoW does not scale, are you really going to argue that it is more energy and dollar efficient than a spreadsheet? You don't even believe this. 
I am following crypto less and less, but last i checked PoS hasn't been proven yet. Or has it? 
Not saying there aren't other options. 
Idk, I just think it is farfetched to think that the world is going to run on crypto, but we can agree to disagree. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:22:28
I don't read people ranting and screaming at me and acting like a petulant child because someone disagrees with them. I was a little sarcastic, and openly said that in the original post to let you know it was goodnatured. You then shouted me down with points that 1) weren't even about things I said 2) were literally sometimes comments from other people? and 3) made you sound like pompous condescending loon. 
You don't own the internet. Go fuck off. The beauty of life is that I don't have to associate with people like you. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:10:11
I’m really not. Fucking google it. There was a study done that showed the methods and it was widely reported in Politico, the guardian, the Atlantic, and elsewhere. I’m not going to take the 10 seconds it would take some troll to do the same. So don’t take me seriously. I really don’t care. If you can’t take 10 seconds to use google you clearly just want to believe what you want to believe. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:22:55
It's not "random" just because you haven't verified it personally. But be my guest, verify it yourself, that would be great. This is the study and explains the methodology. I re-found it rather quickly, but I also knew what I was looking for. Anyway, here you go.
This was widely reported on by many major news outlets. As much as the internet likes to shit on "the MSM," places like the NYTs fact-check the fuck out of stuff. (I have worked in the industry, this is true. Places like the NYT and the Guardian are so thorough in their fact checking that smaller, but still highly respected, publications will accept them as primary fact-checking sources.) No, i have not run the numbers myself, this isn't something I know a lot about. If they are wrong, I would love to know so, but there's no reason for me not to trust them and I haven't seen anyone else debunk them.

Bitcoin uses more electricity than countries the size of Ireland, according to accepted reports. I am not going to sit here and write up a business plan to compare them. Clearly fueling Ireland costs more than hiring a team of people at a bank.

Hey, act like a shit head, people will treat you like one. Everything I wrote was friendly until you started namecalling. 
You're a shit stain. Be better and people will treat you better. 
Blocking you now. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:42:48
Good god, you are delusional. Bitcoin is not more of a sure thing than the US dollar/economy and the global market. That you really think this is so ridiculous that I cannot even waste time responding in depth. What you are trying to insinuate with this post makes it clear you do not understand economics. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:56:04
Well, to be fair a lot of people did only get in within the last few months. So while you may not be "lucky," you're also  simply in a very different position to ride this wave down if you are still way up on what you put in. It's a lot easier psychologically for working class retail investors to lose paper gains than to lose their initial investment... you, in this instance, wouldn't know that as someone who hasn't lost money you actually worked for. So pretty easy to be smug, I guess.
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:35:01
No, you really didn't. I'm not crying, dude. I am fucking laughing at you. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:25:00
Why are you being an idiot about it? 
Let me ask, do you apply this same logic to fiat, which so regularly gets talked down here, as being untrustworthy because it too can lose value? 
Bitcoin is either a currency or an asset. If it falls in price, either way, it is worth less in real terms, whether you want to trade if for dollars or goods/services. Your shitty obfuscation of that point is why people are down voting you. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:36:51


This is sort of true, but it also doesn't have all the consumer protections that people want, regarding theft and fraud. People are always going to be afraid to put all their net worth into something they can lose the password to and never get it back, have it easily stolen by a keylogger, etc. There are work arounds here, but they are going to involve centralization and trusting third parties. (Which we already do anyway with exchanges/conversion programs, etc) 
And also, just because it is trust-less doesn't make it good currency or asset. In a sense, the stock market is also trust-less. Why aren't you raving about that? Yes, it can be manipulated, but so can crypto markets (and far more so, I would say). 


This is verifiably false. What's your source/analysis? Last I checked, Bitcoin alone was using the same energy as 3 million US households. Or around 1% of global electricity production. This is HUGE, and was with less than 1% of global adoption. Find me a financial firm that uses 1% of global energy just to process transactions. 
If crypto is to work it must move away from Proof of Work. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:41:42
You do realize that 92% of the world's currency is already digital, right? And rising? And that says nothing of held assets and stocks and things, just actual cash. 
The money printers of the world are not spend 1% of global electricity production on printing dollar bills
The shit you people spout without doing basic internet research. why post misinformation? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:35:26
I suspect it's a thing you are used to in life. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:53:03
Yes, yes, tell me more about how a ten-year old computer program meant to serve as digital cash that charged as much as $40 per transaction fee and rising and used more electricity than many small developed countries to authenticate transactions before going on to become a speculative asset in a "financial sector" plagued by theft and scams is more of a sure bet than investing in the bonds/stocks/currency of a global civilization that has been growing for thousands of years. Go ahead. I would love to hear more. 
I'm being a little sarcastic, and I don't mean to be a prick, really... but nothing I said there is untrue or a distortion really. 
Look, I own crypto. I made money in it. I lost money in it. I've probably sold at times with my weak hands when I could have made more/stopped losses. But come on, man, this is clearly a geeky computer thing that people are exploiting, both through pure speculation, and maybe some pump and dumps too. Bitcoin is not a new world order. I wish it were. I even just wish crytpo could be stable and free of all this speculation so we could just hold it and use it. Right now it is not and this runup is dangerous and there are going to be a lot of bagholders. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:51:12
I never said that. But that they went through ups and downs before is irrelevant to now. If you bought in early, you are currently safe from real losses on this dip... and you also probably got in with a much lower initial investment in real terms than people that bought in at higher prices in the last few months. And i sure af believe that people who went through a dip back in the day that wiped out real money felt very very worried at the time. But, again, that is irrelevant to their position in this dip. 
And, off topic, but you really are just wrong if you think that because every previous dip recovered, this one will too. The type of people running up the price this time are very different than in 2013. This time was also different in that it exposed Bitcoin's scaling issues. Say what you want, but 99% of the money currently in crypto is speculation hoping to make money off the next "greater fool." There will not always be another fool. We may have reached saturation. You can act like that is impossible, but you'd just be wrong about that as a certainty right now, whether it does eventually recover or not.

It must be super cool to be so much smarter (and vulgar) (and rude) than everyone else. Do you find that it makes people listen to your points? 
As a bit of data for you, I read abut 10% of what you wrote and then wrote you off. 


I'll respond to this one point though. This is fucking delusional if you believe it, though my guess is you don't. 99.9% of people in crypto are here to make a quick buck. Period. You're fucking lying or delusional to think otherwise. Adjust (or not) your prognosis based on that fact, but it is a fact.
