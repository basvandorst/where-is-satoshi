No balance, only keys, thanks, that explains it. So then multiple hardware wallets can access a blockchain address?
I update the software through ledger manager, which hardly works.

Happy HErmin LIkes Beth. Big Chuck Norris Often Fights NEked. NAts MG ALl SIlver Pigment, SLowly CLaws ARound. It worked for the periodic table back in '92 and I still remember it. But yeah I have the words written and securely stored. My indecypherable handwriting is an additional security step.

My seed list is 24 words. I noticed some wallets are 12. Am I correct in assuming that any wallet that accepts a 24 word list can be used to access my btc?

I am sure I could memorize a 12 word list. 24 would be more than twice as hard, but still doable.
 I already have a mycelium and a jaxx wallet. They have 12 word seeds. What would electrum do better?

It's a point of reference. Sometimes when I look at the national debt, I divide it by the population. Its not what I personally owe, but it is a perspective. I've seen alot of posts way more pointless than this. It might inspire an interesting conversation.
