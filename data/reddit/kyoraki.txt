I would suppose the difference with Bitcoin is that all exchanges are available publicly on the blockchain, and due to the magic of the internet, we can know nearly instantly when the sell offs begin. Insider trading isn't a huge secret when anybody with access to a tracker is in on it too.

To be honest? Not really expecting much. This post is purely lethargic, just something I needed to get out of my system.

Yup, username checks out.

Not vanished, stolen. Mark Karpeles can't run forever (especially with his ego), and I doubt it'd be to long before people with stolen funds send the police on him.

That isn't accurate at all. The bitcoin is still in the respective wallets, the rightful owners just don't have access to them anymore. You see, the funds that were stolen were in wallets that were located on Mt.GOX's servers. When the server was taken offline, the wallets didn't disappear. They're still stored on the offline server, effectively stolen.

**If** they start processing again. I can't see them ever opining up again properly, not when their rate is one fifth of the other exchanges, and dropping. It'll bankrupt them within a day.

Ah, the old "I have no idea how any of this technology works, so I'll cry autism and claim I was being metaphorical when people set me right" argument. Classy.

If you opened the page in a desktop, you'll see why. Mobile devices still don't have the grunt to process sites that use parallax effects, which is why it appears glitchy. I'll rework it so the effect is disabled on mobile devices.
