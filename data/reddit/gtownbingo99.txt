Speeding is illegal, I get away with it every day.

DO not pay taxes on it. Don't tell anyone you have it.

Excuses are like assholes...

"but currently its primary use is for anonymous transactions." Just like cash.

You realize you are killing your company with this bullshit right? From now on "MtGox" will be a curse word only uttered in hatred. Nice work!
@_date: 2014-03-11 11:38:40
You could say that about nearly anything. Pointless post.
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:35:07
Eh, its America. Doesnt really hurt anybody. So yeah, like, whatever, carry on.

Way to take a complicated topic and describe it like a no nothing 5th grader.

Youre assuming that the IRS even understands bitcoin. Which is a HUGE assumption. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 16:00:49
Youre joking right? Why don't you go to your nearest federal reserve bank and give them a blank check from your checking account. If youre smart, which it seems you arent (because youre trying to make the government steal money from you) you wouldnt pay a dime in taxes on BTC.

Nice try IRS.

Nice try IRS. You cant catch us all. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:07:42
Your comment has completely changed my view. I have never, and will never, try to hide money which is rightfully mine from the IRS. AHAHAHAAAAA
@_date: 2014-04-16 17:39:40
But they will still reprint you another check.
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:27:02
Only if you get caught. Dont get caught. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:11:07
Yeahhhhh..... I'm just not going to pay it. Its a bullshit law.
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:55:21
Yeah because wanting your hard earned bitcoin makes you a moron right? You are the moron from the looks of it. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 20:43:05
Longest. Sentence. Ever. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 17:37:52
Whats a bitcoin? *wink*
@_date: 2014-04-12 16:05:06
It wont work? You honestly think the IRS has the  manpower to track down everyone not paying their made up bitcoin tax? Youre living in a fantasy land.

Why would i give away my precious'?

Same thing is going on with me kind of at Coinbase! Ordered 2 coins end of july. Was told I would receive them August 6th. Go to check account and the entire transaction disappeared from "transactions," and "buy/sell" section. Yet to no surprise, my bank account was billed the 1st of August. I also have not received an email saying my order was cancelled. In fact I received an email 10 hours ago saying "your 2 bitcoins are now in your wallet." Check just now, and they are still not there! Getting so frustrated, this is a lot of money to me and im freaking out! Am I good? Thank for your help guys! (And this is my 2nd transaction on Coinbase, 1st was a month ago for $150)
