As a person with 1 dollar of BTC in coinbase, this storm is just funny to watch. Ring me up when it falls below 500 then I'll invest. This whole bitcoin thing is inevitably going to rise with time.

How do I transfer funds from
Mycelium to my bank account?
Edit: without coinbase*

If the numbers you say are true and the BTC market is that low now, wouldn't that signal a need for change, that change being from your words "the planned block size limit increase"?

How often is it rewarded? Hourly? Daily? Monthly?

What is the benefit of a hard fork over a soft fork? From what I'm seeing, if what we have right now works with the exception of the Blockchain size limit, wouldn't it be easier on the community to do something backwards compatible?

Is 12.5 btc a number you made up or is that the actual thing, because that's over 10k USD if I'm not mistaken correct? How hard is it to win, and why should I /shouldn't do this?

How effective is just one of those miners?

So I sell bitcoins like they are stocks? If so, how long do I have to wait for someone to buy, or is it an instant exchange?

Why is that, is it really rare to "win"? How much do you think bitcoin is going to increase in value regarding BTC/USD?

I'm just curious what it is.

Bitcoin has dropped about $300 from yesterday/earlier today. I'd invest as I believe the bubble isn't done growing yet
Edit: isn't*
