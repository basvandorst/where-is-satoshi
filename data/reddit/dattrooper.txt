If this is such a big thing, how can be ensured that pools never get there without people having to relocate their miners manually?

You mean..... To the moon?

Absolutely, centralization might still be an issue but the network can work without big exchanges and works without governments.

Im saying that exchanges are not needed if you don't need to exchange for fiat, so there are no corporations to control the flow.
Furthermore, there is more than one digital currency, each with different philosophies.

Personally I hope, once we're done here, we won't ever need to exchange Bitcoin  for fiat.

Thats just a free market. A lot of exchanges have very low fees because they currently can, but the miners dont make money. Then Miners will drop out and exchanges will raise fees to keep their miners on board.

How is Overstock using those bitcoins? Are there any possibilities for retailer-to-retailer sales?
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:27:54
It already was constructed that way, Bitcoin started like that. 
If you set banks and exchanges equal than the difference is clear. There is no government that can regulate and the system works without exchanges because they aren't needed for the code and the network.

I wanted to say that those large entities can't control the system because they are not essential for it and not supported by a government.

Yeah sure, give it an 'anomaly' prompt, but dont permit it, let people send out their transactions with high fees if they like.

How secure is my PC with everything packed behind truecrypt while watching out for internet connection via two firewalls?

Except that coinbase only seems to work with US-based user I think this is really nice!
