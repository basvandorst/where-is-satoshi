I’d be highly impressed if he’s that flexible at his age.

Having a hard time with it. It's been stuck on "refreshing" for my wallets for days, and despite multiple attempts, it won't pull GDAX data in. It may be a victim of its own success.
I opened a ticket and haven't heard back. That site will only be as useful as its ability to perform during tax season.

That might be a known issue. I see a note at the bottom of this issue that matches what you are seeing:

I have this working. The bitcoin app itself needs an update to work with Electrum. It was probably returning the wrong values when queried.
Make sure you have FW 1.3.1 (check) and Bitcoin 1.1.10, then use derivation path m/49'/0'/0' . I was on Bitcoin 1.1.5 and would get that error. Uninstalled the Bitcoin app and reinstalled 1.1.10, and now I have segwit addresses through Electrum 3.0.

That one is in the code. I think we're looking at something else. It's the m/49 that's failing. I'll see what happens when I define LEDGER_NATIVE_SEGWIT
Edit: Nope. m/44 gets me the old addresses and m/49 fails, regardless of that environment variable.
    try:
                 if (os.getenv("LEDGER_NATIVE_SEGWIT") is not None) and self.supports_native_segwit():
    -                xtype = 'segwit'
    +                xtype = 'p2wpkh'
                 elif bip32_path.startswith("m/49'/"):
                     if not self.supports_segwit():
                         raise Exception("Firmware version too old for Segwit support. Please update at

Nope. I can't even send funds into it. I tried sending funds from legacy Nano S to segwit Nano S using Electrum. Electrum had me sign the transaction on the Nano, then it just sat there "not responding".
Work in Progress, I think.
