You can't. The sendtoroute command can be used to balance two existing channels you own.

Yes there was a vote and the consensus is small blocks, we don't vote whenever someone new shows up. The consensus is Bitcoin itself.  
Bitcoin is all inclusive, anyone can use it, but that is the nature of money. You do not deserve money just because you exist. You either have them or you don't Bitcoin its not going to give it to you.  
Some people think they deserve good things for free, those people can wait till they win the lottery or learn how to use money wisely.

A crypto enthusiast would've done his homework and not expect someone else to do it for him.  
Every day theres someone like you wanting his "ideas" to be confronted by professionals because he read something on the internet. Its like going to a group of math professionals and expecting them to teach you basic algebra because if they know it why not?  
It took you 12 years of study to learn math and you don't know it that well, you're not going to understand Bitcoin reading a few articles or watch vids and no one can compress that knowledge for you. You either put in hard work or you're at the mercy of other people that have no incentive to give you good advice because everyone is after your money.

Developers are not 'in charge' the community can always switch to an alternative implementation.  
Your concerns are due to an expected mass adoption but that is not going to happen because that is THE LAST stage of adoption, we are nowhere near that. It is only the get rich quick crowd that thinks mass adoption is right around the corner, we have 10-20 years till that happens.

There is no ideal block size, the discussion has been going on for years and while the Bitcoin community is not against a block size increase it is considered that it is not needed at this time as we're pursuing other venues of scaling. This discussions took place between academic professionals, people with a long track record of developing real world applications that proved their merits through work and not loud words. This is not a debate for uneducated users on a forum to have, nor it is desired that a solution comes from people with no experience in this kind of applications.  
There are plenty of people **claiming** to have solved the scalability problem, yet no proof so far.
