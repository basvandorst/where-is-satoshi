Hey PineappleFund,
Much respect for your kindness. 
Requesting that you assist the South African Family Relief Project. SAFRP help families in desperate poverty who receive no government assistance. In many cases, these people are prevented from working due to government race laws. 
The major beneficiary of the SAFRP's help is a needy community founded on a literal garbage dump.
Their website can be found here: 
I've been involved with this project and vouch for their authenticity and effectiveness. I can certainly help them to accept any Bitcoin donations. I'm also willing to document how any donations are used.

A contentious hardfork will make the coin highly unprofitable for everyone. Why are miners incentivized to support that?

Achieving a deep technical understanding of Bitcoin will always be like mounting Everest. It's possible for anyone in good (mental) shape, if they're determined enough. Most people just don't have the time or inclination.
Ideological principles are a lot more accessible and easy to communicate. There was a lot of crowing about the early idealists making way for commercial applications, etc. Those ideals need to be brought back in a big way. 
If everyone's onboard with decentralization, openness, anonymity, security, fungibility, etc. then the impact of code changes can be more properly assessed. Eg. a non-critical hardfork is bad if it puts some lower-tier "nice thing" above Security.

Disrespectful, dramatic and stupid post. Naturally it gets 20 upvotes on Reddit.
@_date: 2016-01-19 22:56:08
Looks viable, even brilliant. 
Most users are in Bitcoin for the decentralisation. This would cut at the heart of mining centralisation with a chainsaw, ensuring all savvy users stick with Core. Plus, anyone who missed the early days of Bitcoin mining might get a second shot... 
But all this happens only if miners foolishly support further centralisation and demobcrazy in the form of Asslic.
If miners stick with Core, they get to keep their valuable monopoly. But if they push for Asslic, they permanently hitch their wagon to that dubious project. If Asslic fails, they fail, no takesy backsies. 
Asslic's future plans, ie. selectively copying the Core devs' homework for as long as they can get away with it, would likely fall apart with this change too.

The goal is to prove a wallet balance without having to send all funds to a single address or sign with each address. Perhaps this is already possible but I haven't seen it as an in-wallet option.

@_date: 2016-01-21 06:43:40
Nice ad hominem. What will you for an encore?
Instead of getting hysterical, how about you specifically take the time out of your day to understand this: 
In the event of a hardfork, there will be a great deal of chaos and nastiness. Each side can be expected to attack the other. If 75% of mining power truly rests with Classic, it's a matter of time until it's turned against the Core chain in a 51% attack.
To avoid destruction, at the time of the fork Core has no option but to change its algo to protect against this. Anything less would be wildly irresponsible. 
As a secondary effect, this locks out treasonous miners permanently. If/when their Classic fork fails, they're punished economically. When positive incentives fail, negative consequeneces prevent bad behaviour.
(btw: the sun *is* going to run out of fuel)
@_date: 2016-01-20 21:33:39
If the majority of hashpower is put behind Classic then Core has no choice but to switch algos, as a defensive measure. 
So, it's up to the miners. They either place all their trust in these Toomim squirts or wait until April for Core to scale safely and intelligently.
Still, I don't get why it's ok for Classic to put everyone's investment into Bitcoin in jeopardy by forcing this stupid, unnecessary, Hearn-manufactured fork... but God forbid Core should respond to this attack! We should just let these guys seize control because the Bitcoin banks and some clowns on Reddit say so, or what?
Actions have consequences.

One does not simply switch back to Core once the algo's changed. You realise it would no longer be compatible with their ASICs, yes?
Or will the XT/Unlimited/Classic/++ hordes start *another* goddamn hardfork campaign to get Core to revert to SHA256, so as to accomodate treasonous monopoly miners? You really think that idea stands a snowball's chance in hell?

That's great, I'm sure it'll be well-received. It's good to see devs upping their communication game. The right sort of coverage, which makes it accessible to those without a lot of time or background knowledge, will help even more. I've been thinking how best I can contribute to that effort.

I like the icon. Here's my suggestion for a name change.
[The cleansing of the temple,] ( when the moneychanging scammers got their tables flipped, has always seemed appropriate to Bitcoin.  
"And making a whip of cords, he [Jesus] drove them all out of the temple." 
Bitcoin Cords? It's snappy, close to Core, good for design. The concept of chucking out monetary scammers has wide appeal. There's also a lot of great art available which depicts the incident. 
Unsure which features are in your current version so can't help there. Testing out different PoW algos would be very interesting though, if that's possible.

@_date: 2016-01-26 19:59:01
Fully agree. For the second time (1st was XT hardfork risk), I'm seriously considering unholding and golding. 
While the price of gold can be manipulated in paper markets, the substance itself can't be altered at a fundamental level without great effort (smelting).
Bitcoin should reflect this property. Changing Bitcoin in any backwards-incompatible way should *always* be an extremely energy-intensive process, except in an emergency situation (eg. SHA256 is broken).
The intended high difficulty of a hardfork ensures such changes are never made for trivial reasons, or against the wishes of stakeholders and experts.
That the Toomins set a threshold of 75% is a big red flag, especially considering how centralised mining is. They might know enough code to change a parameter but they're clueless about the principles which make Bitcoin, Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-25 08:56:24
Not sure what's more insulting to the intelligence; telling Core developers about flubbergusts in fish talk world or proposing that Bitcoin be designed by Internet committee.

I'll be [referencing]( the list of businesses who supported this idiocy when selecting where to spend or trade my coins in future. As for those users and devs who supported it, their opinion is worth appreciably less to me.
@_date: 2016-01-23 07:55:07
Forcing someone to commit to their choice isn't manipulative, it's simply testing their resolve. One little pull request, devoid of explicit threat, revealed the weakness of Classic's support. That so many supported a project which could be undone by mere "trolling..." Well, back to the drawing board for those looking to divide and conquer Bitcoin, I guess.
@_date: 2016-01-27 09:05:47
u/evoorhees I applaud your efforts to reconcile the community. I agree that Core's efforts at improved communication are welcome.
That said, Move 1) from Core should be met with a corresponding Move 1) from XT/Classic/Unlimited, agreeing not to push hardforks with less than 95% miner approval. I don't think I'm alone in perceiving low-threshold hardforks as hostile.
Move 2) from Core should be met with a corresponding Move 2) from XT/Classic/Unlimited, in which apologies are made for social spam attacks, particularly personal attacks against developers. A self-moderation policy should be agreed to by members of those communities. A simple pledge to "post on other Bitcoin channels as you'd have them post on yours" should cover it.
Compromise involves both sides.
@_date: 2016-01-23 09:57:08
Strategic suggestions are best grounded in realism. Bitcoin will remain under attack for as long as financial incumbents retain control. Divide and conquer social attacks appear to be their current weapon of choice. Seeking consensus with attackers is self-destructive; better to expose their motives and harmful objectives. Bitcoin is the resistance and needs to strategise accordingly.
Internal strife will remain a hardfork risk until social consensus forms around certain foundational principles: decentralisation, openness, security, privacy, fungibility. 
Oppose code changes and business practices which run counter to these principles. Support technical and market solutions which adhere to them. For as long as Core developers remain committed to these principles, they are indeed developing Bitcoin.
Those who whip up the mob by appealling to base emotions like greed (rapid adoption!), fear (full blocks!) and pride (we're the mighty majority!) should be rejected. They're malicious malcontents who only serve the enemy.
By instilling sound principles in the community, it can be hoped some will differentiate into rational individuals, immune to demagogues. Accepting Bitcoin's principles ensures support of that which makes it unique, valuable and revolutionary.
There's some urgency to achieving principled consensus. Who knows what attacks R3 are plotting, guided by the vengeful veterans of several failed coup attempts?
@_date: 2016-03-30 19:13:07
It seems we agree that Lightning is the most promising scaling solution.  
As for any slogan, I believe its purpose should be to attract newcomers to Bitcoin. Keep in mind that newcomers won't have knowledge of on/off-chain scaling proposals, so "unchained" won't resonate with them. Newcomers will likely have heard of Bitcoin though, so "Bitcoin on steroids"-type slogans should prove more effective. 
LN could also be promoted on its advantages over competing payment systems (speed, tiny fees, microtransactional capability, anonymity, reliability etc.) without mention of or reference to Bitcoin. Some kind of "sci-fi money" angle works there, I think.

@_date: 2016-03-30 16:59:49
Yeah. I've often seen LN described as an "offchain" solution by its detractors, I just don't think it's a good angle to highlight. It's also technically incorrect. Like u/jabetizo says: "A channel still needs 2 on-chain transactions."
I like supercharging / superconductivity themes. They fit with the lightning / electricity name and emphasize the fact that LN is an enhancement to Bitcoin, rather than suggesting separation from Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-21 10:07:19
Yes: if the contentious hardfork occurs, the centralised mining cartel becomes a credible threat to the integrity of the Core chain. Core thus has no choice but to alter its PoW or face 51% attacks and other fuckery. Whatever quibbles you may have made, this is the inevitable outcome.
Miners who vote for Classic are thus locking themselves into it, trusting the value of their hardware investment to the inexperienced leadership of the Noobin bros., the magic graphs of that jester Rizun and the demonstrably flawed judgement of Gavin, who supported that Judas, Hearn, for "benevolent dictator" and went Chicken Little for 20 mb blocks.

@_date: 2016-01-21 12:04:12
They'll keep mining ~~Bitcoin~~ Classic, certainly. However, Classic's value will be some fraction of the pre-hardfork price. The messier the hardfork, the lower the price. And believe me, with the majority of coding talent and many wealthy early adopters being sternly opposed to the hardfork, it will get plenty messy... 
Below a certain price threshold, miners start going bust. In the time it takes them to develop new ASICs (if that's even possible) for the Core chain, most miners will probably go under, resulting in an increasingly centralised chain which repels users. Meanwhile, Core can likely maintain a decentralised and secure mining network with home equipment (as Satoshi originally envisaged). 
Both sides will of course suffer tremendous financial losses... Now ask yourself, is the risk worth the reward for miners? Sure, the coup is worth it to the Classic team and Coinbase et al. but miners have the final say - but this was all explained with more clarity and less rhetoric in the original article. I urge you to read it again and stop quibbling over the details.
@_date: 2016-01-26 21:42:08

If we assume that's Bitcoin's only purpose is to be a payment network and further assume that blocksize increases are the only way to scale that network, then perhaps. This highly-flawed assumptive case seems to be Classic's rationale.

Right, probably. Data on privately-owned vs. externally-contributed mining hardware of the various major pools would reveal the true situation. 
If miners could be continually incentivized to switch to smaller pools or P2Pool, which works in a decentralized way, then Bitcoin mining would be freed from the control of a handful of pool operators. Obviously the current situation is undesirable and risky.
I believe that miners would have reason to join P2Pool / smaller pools if users awarded *only those pools* bonus transaction fees. There must be a threshold where higher total fees on a block become more valuable than lower variance. And as more miners move to such pools for the bonus fees, variance decreases.
I think the idea is at least worth investigating further, as hardforking to Keccak (or whatever) only acts as a temporary reset on mining centralisation.
Wumpus suggested an implementation which would *almost* achieve this effect: "add an extra output to your transaction to a N-out-of-M P2SH address controlled by those 'designated miners'." 
I don't understand that method in technical depth, but I take his word that it will work. The only problem, as he explained it, is that the selected pools get a bonus fees no matter which pool mines the transcation. What makes more sense is for P2Pool / selected small pools to get the bonus fee only if *they* mine the relevant transaction. Otherwise big miners have no incentive to switch.
Anyone got an idea how to refine this? As fees become a bigger share of mining revenues, this method becomes a better incentive. It essentially gives users a way to vote for mining decentralisation with their wallets.

Honestly, I think it's too soon to be bashing LN. Let's see how it works in practice before judging it. Predicting the behaviour of complex new systems is just asking to be proven wrong in the fullness of time. Really smart people dismissed Bitcoin for years.
1/4 fees is an individual advantage. I don't expect it to lead to overnight adoption but it's a good incentive to fast uptake, as are the other benefits of SegWit.

Learnt something new from a comment there by babkjl:
"I have a Trezor Bitcoin hardware wallet. It's a small plastic device that connects to a computer with a USB cable and has a tiny screen. It contains the private keys and signs transactions internally, not inside your computer that may be compromised. The tiny screen shows a scrambled matrix of numbers to confirm your password so that key loggers and other thieves cannot grab your password. It does rely on a copy of the blockchain being held somewhere on an internet connected server. I was quite surprised to learn that the server it currently uses is owned by Blythe Masters. It doesn't have to use her server as the makers of the Trezor could easily arrange to point it to a different server. She just happens to have the best deal at this time to provide the service: free. It was a nuisance to hold the blockchain inside my computer and I'm very happy with the Trezor. I am rather conflicted about having this connection to her, but I know that my bitcoins are as safe as gold in my hands and it's very easy to anonomize my transactions."

Simplifying Bitcoin is hard work. I know because I've been writing introductory guides for the past few weeks.

I agree with tmornini. Suggest to them a good wallet, probably Mycelium as others suggested, and walk them through receiving payment securely. The 0 conf risk is a good point.
Then ask providers to give a special rate to clients who teach them, in-person, how to use other wallet features and the basics of Bitcoin. Providers will then be ready to accept their first payment and put it towards Backpage or whatever. 
This gets the ball rolling on both sides. It seems to me Bitcoin is a major advantage to providers - no more risk from banks or keeping large amounts of cash. On the client side, anonymising Bitcoin transactions (I recommend going through Monero on the site) is more hassle than paying with cash, so specials are approriate. 
I believe "special" is a better way to broach the subject than "discount," which some providers take mild offence at.

Reads like hype. History tends to make fools of those who proclaim the death of monetary forms. Gold was dismissed as a relic of barbarism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries - but look at its price today (spiking as China devalues the Yuan once again). 
What does seem to be on the way out is the credibility of fiat currency. Fiat's inflationary and centrally-planned nature will be its undoing.
Wealth will flow into trustless currencies like precious metals and cryptocurrencies, though I doubt fiat will ever entirely disappear. PM is as trustless as it gets and the safest option for long-term wealth storage. Cryptocurrency is superior for all other tradtional monetary functions, plus it allows new functions. 
This process will take time however, it's premature to say that decentralised money has replaced other forms or redefined money as "an image."

That said, anyone who really believes Bitcoin has no future should just short it and save their breath for their porridge.
