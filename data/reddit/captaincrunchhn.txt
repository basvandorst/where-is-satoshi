We are required to keep such information on file for 7 years. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:18:07
Just use [Vault of Satoshi]( - at least if you deposit before you realize you cannot use the site, you can always withdraw them... mistakes happen.

No, we have strong ties with our banks. The latest "BMO" thing only affected the exchange that reported the issue. Everyone else is eating popcorn watching the drama.
@_date: 2014-02-21 12:41:46
we're looking at ways to improve the site, we know the verification process has a lot of room for improvement. If you still are in the dark, give us a ring and we can get you through it.

TL;DR: Selfies are no longer required, and I’d also like to apologize for my behaviour in handling this situation.
In the past 24 hours, we’ve had a lot of negative attention with regard to our policy on “selfies”.  A recent change to our verification policy has been the requirement for users to upload a selfie in order to allow us to match a photo ID to a person. This was put in place as a knee-jerk reaction to the influx of fraud that came with instant online Interac deposits.  We felt the selfie was a clever and reasonable way of tying a person's photo ID to their actual person without being able to see them in the real world.  We didn't realize at the time that it would cause such an uproar about privacy, but we can understand where the community is coming from.  Effective immediately, we will no longer be requiring the use of "selfies" for verification purposes.
We apologize to any users that we might have offended or lost as a result of this policy, and we will try to be more in tune with our users' perspective before implementing any new policies.
Sincerely, Mike
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:26:43
Adding selfies initially stopped the fraud. But since we've been adding methods of determining fraud before it happened. All of the things we've done are working well, and are comfortable with removing the "selfies".
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:53:05
We do for Fiat, but for Crypto, we've not found anyone able to insure us. We're constantly looking however.
@_date: 2014-06-24 21:06:51
We feel that we can provide a lot more than the other cloud mining contracts out there... etc: Butterfly labs - $108 for 10 GH/s?
In the press release there was an error made, it should have said minimum of "9 months return" however it was to late when it went out. 
In our beta we were selling 1GH/s for about $7.00 for 1 year. Its now $5.00 for as long as it will run profitable.
Nothing is perfect the first time, you can expect improvements to come as we figure everything out. Besides, this is one of the better ones, if not the best I've seen for mining contracts. You can actually get out of it provided others will take your coins.
As for allowing the sale of the coins before we issued them: we allowed pre-orders to get a feeling of demand.
If there is anything else I can help you with, please reply with concerns/questions.

It's backed by our Server farm at VOS. There is no block chain, and yes the coin cannot be transferred else where. Its like a mining contract, only buyable/sellable only on VoS.

I am aware of the AML &amp; KYC, but I wasn't aware that Bitcoin was considered a currency in Canada for those laws to be relevant.
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:43:49
To be completely honest, this was just a knee jerk reaction to an influx of fraud. There was no other reason for it other than that. We should have handled it a lot differently. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:19:12
It's called self-regulation. They should perhaps disable their inbound addresses if they do not intend to return coin to the less informed.

We usually plan things pretty well, unfortunately, the servers bitcoin database got corrupt. Its nearly completed.
@_date: 2014-06-04 20:33:12
We have a confirmation screen AFTER you try to place the order. It pretty much catches mistakes to a point.

@_date: 2014-07-17 22:52:40


Yes, we'll be discarding any selfies we have (even the funny ones)
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:53:23
We're implementing a system now to expose our Cold and Hot balances. We're also looking into a external security company. We just started dealing with Equifax Canada, so we have to have all this in place anyhow.. great timing for us.
I think the only way for exchanges to gain trust back, is to be transparent. Faces to Exchanges, thus having to answer for their actions. Keep following us, we're going to have a lot more transparency shortly.
@_date: 2014-07-17 01:35:56
We care about our relationships with banks is why, as well as interac chargebacks.. For every fake ID there is a scammer sitting behind the ID defrauding us through Interac.
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:30:56
We're always 3 steps ahead of any current situation.

@_date: 2014-03-09 19:15:54
So you are saying Bitcoin is officially a currency in Canada now? 
Addition: Also, if they were serious about protecting themselves, they would simply not allow deposits from unknown users.

No, you can always withdraw from Vault of Satoshi. You just cannot always deposit. The exact way it should be.
@_date: 2014-02-21 05:41:09

This reason is dead on, however you don't require a selfie to withdraw your funds. We've had a lot of stolen identity lately with the new online interac option. Unlike banks, we don't have a face-to-face meetings when our clients come on board - we feel this is the next best thing. 
If there is a better solution out there, we are all ears.
@_date: 2014-06-03 21:14:42
Independent exchanges, supply and demand. Looks like we're a lot closer to the Bitstamp price (converted to CDN of course).
Either way, enjoy the spread, so much opportunity for arbitrage!

Nope, VoS is 1.0%, CaVirtex is 1.5%. Vault of Satoshi is still cheaper. Not to mention, CaVirtex claim to be the first in Canada to offer LTC, which - they're either pretty "out of it", or are lying to their users.
QuadrigaCX was first for LTC-&gt;CAD, and VoS was second...

The selfie would have been you holding up your drivers license in one hand, with a hand written note. 
The ID is encrypted and then stored in a highly secure file system off-site. The only reason to keep the information is to provide Fintrac and other financial institutions back-up information if we're ever asked for it. If any copies are ever used with these financial institutions, they are discarded securely with Iron Mountain (which all Canadian Banks use).
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:01:15




Cash deposits may be a possibility at the location, however we really don't want to hold a lot of cash here, if any at all.

You have to be level 2 to withdraw money. Or buy coin and withdraw it.
@_date: 2014-01-10 13:25:37
Mike from VoS here... It's totally optional, eventually we MAY restrict new things that require it, but for now... totally optional.
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:31:52

@_date: 2014-07-17 16:59:51
We were never required to do selfies, they were just an additional method of catching fraud. With the fraud detection methods we've developed since adding Interac, the selfies were pointless.
We've had a number of complaints about the selfies long before this post, so I have no regrets removing them once and for all. 
When I was locked out of my account at Bitstamp (lost my phone/two-factor device) it took me a few selfies to get my account back, I was thoroughly annoyed with selfies as well.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:18:13
We would face the same outcome doing that. It will cost over $7 million dollars for us to operate in the states, living there, or here.
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:06:04
Mike from VOS here. A lot of people send us CAD funds even though we don't technically trade in them, thus releasing this first takes responsibility of us doing the currency exchange and putting it on the customer who did it. We do have Canadian deposits opening this week to make it easier to get money in, and in the next couple weeks we will be accepting bill payments.
Furthermore, we have CAD trading coming within ~30 days. So, we're just releasing as we complete things. 
30 days from now we will have CAD/USD and Coin-to-coin trading (BTC-&gt;LTC, etc). We'll also be releasing a ton of new coins to the exchange shortly after that. (Yes, BTC-e is in our cross hairs next)
@_date: 2014-07-17 17:00:11
Yes, it required hand written notes with a date.
@_date: 2014-05-21 02:20:34
Today, Bitstamp, QuadrigaCX and Vault of Satoshi were all in the same price range... (within ~$5.00) CaVirtex was about $20.00 cheaper than everyone else. Unsure why... but good deal for someone.

It's heaven compared to the US. We only have to Register with Fintrac (which we have done, and been notified of the acceptance), as well as register with one province "Quebec".
In the US, it is much different... we'd have to be registered with Fincen (which we did) - the hard part is having to register with 48 of 50 States (we love you South Carolina and Nevada!).

Currently there is only one place that is insured by Llyods (they are a cold storage wallet service - I forget the name). Other than them, everyone dealing with exchanges has the same risk, with the exception of our Fiat. Unsure how Mt Gox managed to go through their fiat?

Hey Guys, this is Mike from Vault of Satoshi. Everything is fine here. You may notice that the poster of this thread's account is less than 30 days old and just trying to get everyone excited. 
We are seeing an issue with an old wallet server technically nobody should be on (only about 5% of our user base). Best thing to do is generate a new wallet. The old server should be up and running very soon.
As for staff, Adam is no longer with us but we still have the same amazing support team as always and are always around to help.
You can always audit us with our proof of solvency.
The support page is unfortunately out of our hands and is a Zend desk issue. We changed to an EV2 certificate and they have not bothered to update it yet.
Anyhow, we're still here doing awesome stuff. 
@_date: 2014-05-28 03:21:51
(we at) Vault of Satoshi use proof of Solvency:  
I'd love Bitstamp follow suit.

Mike Curry here from Vault of Satoshi. Just wanted to let everyone know someone sold a large amount (a market order) and went through every order on the site, even getting down to the penny buys.
I'd like to remind everyone, if you're going to put a &lt; market limit on sells, and the order is big enough... you will get through the walls and eventually sell for less than you want to.
We did extensive testing today, and everything seems to be fine, we're still looking into it.

This is only for anything Fiat, once we have coin to coin trades, you'll be able to trade at 0.5%. Unfortunately, its the heavily regulated Fiat thing that makes it expensive.

TL;DR: Selfies are no longer required, and I’d also like to apologize for my behaviour in handling this situation.
In the past 24 hours, we’ve had a lot of negative attention with regard to our policy on “selfies”.  A recent change to our verification policy has been the requirement for users to upload a selfie in order to allow us to match a photo ID to a person. This was put in place as a knee-jerk reaction to the influx of fraud that came with instant online Interac deposits.  We felt the selfie was a clever and reasonable way of tying a person's photo ID to their actual person without being able to see them in the real world.  We didn't realize at the time that it would cause such an uproar about privacy, but we can understand where the community is coming from.  Effective immediately, we will no longer be requiring the use of "selfies" for verification purposes.
We apologize to any users that we might have offended or lost as a result of this policy, and we will try to be more in tune with our users' perspective before implementing any new policies.
Sincerely, Mike

Our fees for Fiat are higher, however when we activate coin-to-coin (sans fiat regulations) we'll be allowing 0.5% trade.

I am also sorry.
@_date: 2014-06-26 19:40:15
It is possible a buy order could be mistaken for a sell order with the ability to swap payment currency or the order currency.
i.e: put a buy order in for DIV using BTC, and click the &lt;- -&gt; swap arrows.
The estimated time was more 8-9 months but the press release was already our before we caught it. Most competitors are charging more than $5.00, and usually for the period of a year.

There is no point keeping them.
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:31:01
The fees affected are Fiat only, once coin-2-coin arrives we'll be doing the 0.5% fees. Most of it comes out of all the work behind the scenes for meeting regulations.
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:13:59
I totally agree, posting an address is just inviting them to take coin, and keep it.
@_date: 2014-06-20 20:42:43
Yes, in fact, when we add more hardware, we'll add the hardware a few days before issuing the coin allowing users to get a small bonus.

Mike from Vault of Satoshi here: We do not have this problem, nor have we ever. Although the main issue in the post above is developers who don't know how to the fundamentals of  locking/transactions, the fact is our minimum orders for any currency are 0.01 or greater and have been since we've launched. 
If you ever find an exchange like this, I'd say the exchange deserves a greater amount of attention, as they do not deserve to be holding peoples money. If there is a basic locking issue there, I am sure there are many other amateur mistakes elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:33:10
AND DONE. You can now see QR codes from the deposits screen.

You should familiarize yourself with the standards that AWS has put in place: 
@_date: 2014-06-15 15:37:50
Mike from Vault of Satoshi here:
First thing I suggest is that if you are going to do a new deposit, generate a new bitcoin address. We have an older bitcoin server that very few use, and we're reindexing the database as it got corrupt. 
Anyone having this issue has likely been using the same wallet address since inception.
Anyhow, to smooth things over, please send me an email to mike and we'll figure something out for the LONG delay.
Apologies guys/gals

I am in 100% agreement with their move to AWS. We've been there from DAY  and let me tell you - AWS has world class security experts specialized in software, hardware, and physical assets. Not only that, but the layered levels of security practises they have, are far greater than anyone else out there renting servers for as low as $9.99 a month.
We had many concerns about starting something so risky in a place seeming "open" however, once you attend the security talks, speak to AWS personnel first hand at the AWS Conference, and interact with support, and experiment on the platform by posting database passwords on the front page your your beta test website (Yes, we actually did that, as well as gave out root passwords to the servers on the front page) - you'd never know how much research they've done.
If that is not enough, why not see what other type of companies use AWS? Like (Banks)[ Not satisfied? How about watching some of the testimonies from other companies that use it like NASDAQ, or how about FINRA? 
How many Assurance programs does YOUR hosting company have? One? None? AWS has many: PCI DSS Level 1, SOC 1/ ISAE 3402, SOC 2, SOC 3, ISO 9001, IRAP (Australia), FIPS 140-2, CJIS, CSA, HIPAA, FedRAMP (SM), DoD CSM Levels 1-2, 3-5, DIACAP and FISMA, ISO 27001, MTCS Tier 3 Certification, ITAR, MPAA, and G-Cloud. Here is the source: 
I'd suggest anyone wondering about the security of AWS is like, to browse their comprehensive security document here: 
Take all of that, get a group of people who know what they're doing, you get a rock solid secure exchange. However, it doesn't all just fall together because of the place you are putting your software, it also has to be paired with equivalent skill in computer security for the software/exchange side.

Nope, someone went through all the sell orders with a huge sell off (and a limitless order)
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:23:30
Well, it started by sending a wire through RBC which got declined for a reason I wasn't allowed to be told (I'm sure it wasn't because of the AK-47 that was in my hand, or the fact I was dressed like a freedom fighter... perhaps Mt. Gox is in North Korea, not Japan?!) 
So I drove over to Scotia Bank, and they wired the money.  Once it reached Mt. Gox and the other reached CAVirtex in the storm of the mass sell off, I transferred it all over to BTC-e (Mother Russia) and quickly bought up all the LTC I could before transferring it out to my paper wallet...

@_date: 2013-04-18 17:03:42
Talked over it with my business partner, in addition to the bitcoin, I'm giving out an additional $500.00 in increments of $20.00 for exploits/hacks/bugs based on the severity.
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:44:53
We'll issue prizes in a couple weeks, but the offer is open for 30 days from this date.  We could always allow you to do this on our test servers when we are live.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:51:12
Sounds bad for email! We have a pile of stuff being looked over, so I guess it won't be surprising if this gets scratched.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:22:02
This is the basic system:
Apache, PHP w/APC all on AWS. Our stack is inside an Amazon VPC over two subnets - 1 public which you're looking at, and a private subnet that is connected via Hardware VPN to our colo at 151 Front St. in Toronto Ontario (
Our production stack, which you don't see uses Amazons scaling abilities which we have configured to grow the stack as resources are needed - mostly scripted in Puppet. There is a second failover system setup on Rackspace in case there is an Amazon outage. The production Environment also utilizes CloudFlare.
Our Database servers sitting in a cage a stone throw from Toronto Stock Exchange servers, Royal Bank and TD Servers. Our secondary datacenter is north of the City.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:07:23
Thanks, I apologize. I will do so thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:40:39
What was the password?  Hopefully you can post it here as it shoudln't have been used anywhere else - or just email it to hello
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:35:49
API is being stress tested, and we'll be announcing more about the rest soon.
@_date: 2013-10-18 19:42:37
We were just contemplating Comic!!
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:45:17
GRAMMAR NAZI! We have a support ticket in with them.. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:37:01
Reddit is deciding... it has a spinny... a spinny...
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:06:43
We could make an exception, if you guys can fire through some verification info within a month. Email us at hello
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:35:14
We're investigating this... will have more info soon.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:06:02
How about you come test out the exchange we just announced today!!  We're operating on TestNET currently:
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:11:46
We don't mess around!!
@_date: 2013-11-29 01:33:02
I am a redditor, It's all good. It is a crazy time! We're learning and improving the service every day, and after this crazy burst of deposits, we're making even more improvements.
PS- Nobody wants to get the money deposited faster than me, we just hired 4 new girls to start Monday - and if we don't have the deposits in our system trading - we don't make a cent! :)
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:02:54
Critical +20 - 1 Gold to the face!
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:15:44
1) We have a few different methods we are looking into, until they are cleared by our council we won't use them.
2) We've registered with Fintrac twice, they insist we do not require such magic. However our lawyers are working this stuff out.
@_date: 2013-10-28 00:36:32
We disabled things until it was worked out. Everything is running smoothly now. Sorry for the inconvenience - better safe than sorry! :)
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:08:54
PM Me a link to your Linkedin ;)
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:42:23
You can send your account more BTC from here: 
**For the concerned:** We'll be replenishing the faucet with everything we're left with to help other developers - please don't drain the faucet! 
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:35:47
We support cheques and wires currently... more coming.
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:52:13
Take the coin now- we have a few very creative exploits so far which we're working on that have been pretty insane.  But, hey- this is the exchange speaking!!  
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:59:04
We're going to be bringing lower fees, bitcoin, litecoin, PPcoin and a few others to mention.  We'll also be giving you an alternative to Mt. Gox.  There are a few other differentiators, but they will be announced soon.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:48:11
Another one inbound, and testing on TestNET as of Today:
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:47:24
About a minute.
@_date: 2013-04-19 11:21:55
We'll be getting back to emails within 2 weeks.
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:28:27
*cough* PPC... few days... 
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:34:16
It will, it's a crazy time for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:35:33
We'll be adding CAD as a currency within a couple weeks :) You'll have the ability change the currency in which the order books are displayed.
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:49:09
You didn't just say that...
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:40:38
Start here: 
Copy and paste that stuff in a text box, hit submit - look for smoke and fire!
@_date: 2013-04-19 05:09:01
I'll have the developers put something together.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:09:39
We're holding back for the press release, until then, just use fake info for the exchange ;)
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:00:49
That's just a nice round number for testing... we'll be upping it to 25% once we are live ;)
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:43:14
Just keep it quiet and move on.
@_date: 2013-10-28 14:57:05
Thanks for the input, we're looking over a few options.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:37:56
Reproduced, thanks - we're looking at this now.
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:06:59
No, we have investors.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:54:47
haha, yea it keeps me sane! 
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:27:17
That info is coming!  Lawyers are working as fast as they can with the corp papers etc, once things are set... we'll let you know.
In the meantime, assume the worst... assume we're the NSA/CSIS stealing all your data!
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:21:26
We figured it was the most used API and thus set some sort of standard. If you look carefully, ours differs n many ways... and will start to differ more as time goes on.
@_date: 2013-10-23 13:47:50
We did miss some payouts (my personal bad) I did attempt to apologize for this in our big gold thread the other day. We are looking at several bounty systems with some companies to make this process a lot easier.
I do however specifically remember this email, just pulled it up - seems I fixed the issue back in May - however I did not send a reward - **looks like I didn't even reply to it**, sorry about that. Did someone else contact you because I don't recall saying it didn't deserve a reward.
Either way, please send an email to hello from and I'll look into it personally.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:55:05
Mike from VOS Here, glad everyone is liking it so far, we had a lot of verifications and deposits today. Things are getting a lot more routine and we're starting to automate everything we can, system by system. You can expect automated withdraws, and some other really cool things shortly. CAD balances as well as Direct Deposit/EFT are coming in a couple weeks as well as a new billing feature we're going to announce soon - I am sure will be very popular.
Question  You can securley upload them, send them via PGP or even with 70's fax technology! ;)
Question  Cash deposits are pretty much done before you get home, but can sometimes can take 2-3 hours depending on a few different situations. We support Wire Transfer, Cash Deposit, Check and have bill payments coming shortly as well.
Question  We process and mail them same day, wires are also same day.
@_date: 2013-11-01 14:43:57
Cash deposits hit your account after you've notified us of it, and we have verified it came in. Wires are ~2 days.
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:09:24
We're looking at doing Google Auth currently, we'll look into Yubikey now. Thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:57:48
@_date: 2013-10-28 16:09:27
It does read super wrong, ah well, perhaps I can revisit this post April 1st, 2014!! :)
@_date: 2013-02-05 17:53:40
Your server is in no means secure.  The PCI-DSS scan as well as some other tests have failed miserably.  You need to hire yourself a security expert before doing anything on that server with money!!!!
I'm not trying to piss you off, but that is exactly why think I will have a chance.
@_date: 2013-07-10 13:17:26
We are formally the "Toronto Bitcoin Exchange" (which has been in testing since April). We'll be opening soon with our new site name and wanted to let the Bitcoin community of Reddit come help us choose our logo!  (We're opening with Litecoin and Bitcoin)
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:19:17
Everyone in Bitcoin expects bank issues, we're working on it though... or our council is rather.
Two factor?! Hmm... yes.
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:45:08
YOU BROKE IT AMERICAN!  Kidding, if you could send reproducible steps to hello that would be wonderful, and we can get to the bottom of it.
@_date: 2013-11-01 15:31:51
The volume gets better everyday. I can say there is a lot of USD sitting here waiting for orders. Wednesday we did a 24 hour volume of 130 BTC (which is near 25% of some of our CDN counterparts daily volume). 
Hope to see you soon :)
@_date: 2013-12-16 13:18:24
Some wires come through the same day, others take a ridiculously long time. We want your money to be available as fast as possible so that we can start making money - we don't make money until you are trading. Depending on where it comes from, sometimes it just gets held - we see it often. If it is not being held, and sitting in our account - it likely doesn't have your name on the beneficiary line - some banks have sent us wires with nothing but an amount and a value date. Other times, the amount is way off missing a name - because tellers think we deal in Canadian funds and try to convert it for you.
All your bank can do is confirm that they've released the funds - easy to check - but doesn't mean a whole lot. There is a beneficiary that can hold it, and after that there is our bank which can also hold it. If you are worried about your money, initiate a "trace" with your bank.
For future notes, wires "can" be fast, but sometimes get slowed down by any of the three banks that your money hits. It's often a lot faster and cheaper to get a certified cheque and overnight it - you'd be trading in 24 hours.
Send me an email with the scan of the wire to mike and I will look into it, chances are - it is being held, or sitting on our beneficiaries desk waiting in line to be released.
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:32:06
Where are the stats for this kind of thing?
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:57:38
We can do cash, anyone getting a reward can request cash.
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:41:41
Bill payments coming soon... 
@_date: 2013-10-18 19:47:33
And I wish you the best of GOLD.
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:10:09
...so you are saying there is a chance of me cracking it?!
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:15:58
If it moved from Queued -&gt; processing you'll make me sh*t my pants!  We're debating on whether to allow queued transactions that cannot possibly be done - welcoming input!
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:29:23
Not yet, wires and cheques will have to do until SEPA.
@_date: 2013-02-06 15:38:19
Since Bitcoin addresses are basically random numbers, it is possible, although extremely unlikely, for two people to independently generate the same address. This is called a collision. If this happens, then both the original owner of the address and the colliding owner could spend money sent to that address. It would not be possible for the colliding person to spend the original owner's entire wallet (or vice versa). If you were to intentionally try to make a collision, it would currently take 2^107 times longer to generate a colliding Bitcoin address than to generate a block. As long as the signing and hashing algorithms remain cryptographically strong, it will likely always be more profitable to collect generations and transaction fees than to try to create collisions.

Finally he admits it... 
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:25:38
- Yes we like Americans. The money gets wired to a US Account
- To get money to you its a few days tops. To get money from you its 3-5 business days unless you same day us a certified cheque.
- We have partnerships with 3 banks, it was previously 4.
- We already have a market maker, the money is being wired as we speak...
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:13:02
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:33:29
We'll have lower rate ;)
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:59:19
That would be perfect.
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:44:42
1. If you're not sure what PGP is you could google it, I will add info on it however to our site. You can do secure uploads from inside your account now - should be a lot easier.
2. Email is not secure unless using some encryption method (such as PGP) again - you could upload your docs deom inside your account.
3. We're going to be starting a campaign next week - keep your eyes open! ;)
@_date: 2013-04-19 04:51:58
We'll be adding more crypto's - you can see the different balances for them in the GUI currently.

I am the founder of Vault of Satoshi. Glad you like it! We're going to be adding some information to the site (like an ABOUT page) within the next week. But to put your concerns to rest, I can dump some stuff about the site and myself here:
Vault of Satoshi is a reputable Canadian owned and operated peer-to-peer virtual currency trading platform serving a Global market. We allow you to trade fiat currency (such as Canadian or US Dollars) for crypto-currencies like Bitcoin or Litecoin with other members of the Exchange safely and reliably.  Because you are trading with other users we don’t interfere in the transaction. The price you buy or sell currencies is entirely up to you. 
**Our Philosophy**
We are a fun spirited team of seasoned technology entrepreneurs who get excited about the possibility that brews in big ideas that have the potential to change the world we live in. One thing we all have in common is that we all care deeply about creating positive change in this world. We know what doesn’t work in our society and are eager to support new ideas that evolve us as a collective. Great things happen when courageous people come together and pave the way for new thinking. We think crypto currency presents an opportunity for us all to shift our thinking and create a more sustainable economy where we the people are the governing body. 
Our team is comprised of senior developers, lawyers, designers, marketers, financial experts, and technology advisors. We are currently expanding our team.
My name is Mike

We are implementing automated withdraws, EFT/Direct deposit and will be available soon. For the time being we process every withdraw as they come in same day.
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:52:03
Nope, we're up! :) When in doubt check our service status:  status.vaultofsatoshi.com
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:15:20
There is another 160 coming now... :D
For now, we want to keep it simple with BTC &amp; LTC (the gold and silver of the currencies.) However if we see something else shine and perhaps fit into a Bronze type coin, we'd consider it.
To get money out of our exchange is pretty quick. A wire or a cheque to us will fund the account in a few days. More ways coming shortly... but for now............. GOLD.
@_date: 2013-10-18 19:21:47

I'll take a look at some of those points. Some we have addressed already.
- Bank of Satoshi in header mails was fixed (branding change before launch due to legal reasons)
- We don't use OTP, that is a has for activation - it only verifies your email address.
- We cancelled our service with GAuthify last week, they were having two many issues.
- in the process of moving off of godaddy.

We're working hard on getting deposits through, and keeping them fast. I've just hired another 4 people to help out... unfortunately they won't start until December 1st. So its just the four of us here doing verifications and deposits.
So basically, we're working on deposits overtime, doing whatever it takes to get them done.
**EDIT:** We hired a couple people for weekends as well! :)

2) Sorry, that is misleading, all funds are US Dollars. We will be adding a few more FIAT currencies to the exchange in the next couple months.
These fixes will be up in the next few days. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:46:16
Send an email to me mike - with your sign-up email, I'll let yo know what is going on.
@_date: 2013-11-11 12:42:08
No, just make sure your info is filled out, as well as upload the two items we require (photo ID and proof of residency)
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:55:40
That is an OCD feature that we haven't yet fixed... enjoy it while it lasts! :D

They'll be converted to USD... the money of our southern Neighbours... 
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:52:30
We do support Wires and certified cheques. More options are coming shortly!
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:58:37
Hmm.. that is a good point... pm me your CC# and we can work it out.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:31:52
In fact, if there is any other way to deposit Euro - perhaos we could look into it... North American wires are about 24 hours, Cash deposits are in a couple hours usually, so how do we fix Euro deposits?
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:16:49
I'll read up on this one for sure!
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:16:10
Email me at mike - I'll work it out for you. We're receiving about 1 deposit every two minutes right now.
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:01:00
We're touchy feely people! :D
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:18:45
Not sure... but I'll up that time later on tonight when I come back with more gold!!
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:56:03
You cannot not have gold.
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:46:21
It's not bitcoin... so it's not really a big deal. Wait until we have a tip-a-thon.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:36:45

Noted, and getting fixed! :)
@_date: 2013-10-18 19:34:04
Well, this isn't the place to talk about it... but have you ever tried to buy LTC with money? 
@_date: 2013-02-07 15:11:21
Looks like a client issue.  
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:27:04
Only been open for a week, wires are flying around like mad though.
@_date: 2013-11-01 16:20:13
We just had this same request via support. Our incoming wire fee's are $14.00 - we don't charge anything unless the bank charges us on all of the other methods. 
We've updated code to show all deposit methods, however they won't go live probably until Monday.
We're always adding new methods, and we only pass through bank charges. We'll definitely make this a lot more easier to find. Thanks for the input.
Withdrawing can be done in several ways (cheque, wire, cert. cheque, money order, Email Interac, etc), again the cost is just passed on to you. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:17:38
Looking into all this, thanks!  As for the bitcoin wallets, they'd have to be TestNET currently - try sending and receiving here: 
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:30:13
Its just a bad cname thing.. being updated as we speak!
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:14:31
We did, we only require one photo ID and proof of residency now.
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:13:54
Sorry, yes - currently we only operate in USD-  we are implementing CAD just as we did with PPC over a weekend. We just need to do a lot of testing and make sure our test coverage is where I want it. All identification documents are in cold storage, thus the reason they are unavailable after upload.
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:38:06
Thanks we tried to make it something we'd want to use ourselves... 
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:20:11
We have more authentication options coming also!! ;)
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:33:53
Yep, we're going to undercut most exchanges out there as one of our many goals.  We're also adding a few other crypto currencies soon.
@_date: 2013-10-08 16:26:21
Certified Check, Bank Wire - more coming shortly.
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:22:03
We wanted to make verifications a priority.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:34:56
We're going to enable all safe options, there are a couple options we want to offer that are listed, however - they may be gone before launch.
@_date: 2013-11-12 23:15:27
4KB Accounts still cost nothing at VoS.

haha, I'm downtown all the time - let us know what you find!
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:30:49
Can't wait! Looking forward...
@_date: 2013-12-16 13:11:39
Some wires come through the same day, others take a ridiculously long time. We want your money to be available as fast as possible so that we can start making money - we don't make money until you are trading. Depending on where it comes from, sometimes it just gets held - we see it often. **If it is not being held, and sitting in our account - it likely doesn't have your name on the beneficiary line - some banks have sent us wires with nothing but an amount and a value date.** Other times, the amount is way off missing a name - because tellers think we deal in Canadian funds and try to convert it for you.
All your bank can do is confirm that they've released the funds - easy to check - but doesn't mean a whole lot. There is a beneficiary that can hold it, and after that there is our bank which can also hold it. If you are worried about your money, initiate a "trace" with your bank. 
For future notes, wires "can" be fast, but sometimes get slowed down by any of the three banks that your money hits. It's often a lot faster and cheaper to get a certified cheque and overnight it - you'd be trading in 24 hours.
Send me an email with the scan of the wire to mike and I will look into it, chances are - it is being held, or sitting on our beneficiaries desk waiting in line to be released.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:18:56
We are implementing Cloudflare on our production nodes now, we'll see how it goes.  We also have a scalable system, its currently capped on this production cluster.  We'll be planning a DDOS test next week.
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:12:38
Done: message is here: 
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:52:01
I am satisfied now.
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:38:34
So much going on, this is by far the busiest venture I've taken on. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:18:20
This will be given to my council... for now GOLD. Honestly I let them figure this stuff out... I just write code and look ahead to see what is next.
@_date: 2013-10-18 19:11:58
God dammit... I am being laughed at... that means gold.
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:24:46
Gold... just because I can!
@_date: 2013-06-10 19:25:30
You can expect fee's to be as good or better than liberty bit, as for deposit and withdraw, pretty much anything not able to be reversed - more to come.
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:45:51
No screen shots for you!
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:52:11
btcto.com is also using cloudflare! :D
@_date: 2013-10-23 13:37:28
Send an email to hello and I'll look into it personally.

Gold for the [Grammar NAZI](
(I will fix this)
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:15:39
Thats pretty crazy. If you're patient, you could send a Tellers check/bank draft - we usually receive them in 4-5 business days and there is never a hold. ~$15 shipping with tracking and no fees here.
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:41:18
It gets converted by the bank, so just their fees - we don't add anything. We pass on any wire fees, etc.
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:15:11
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:31:17
It's not that we cannot do it, we're just waiting for our 3 banks to allow us to do wires without leaving our office building. Currently myself and my business partner are the only ones who can wire. Up until now, we've been taking turns going to the bank and has been sufficient. We're now automating the process and will be one less thing to worry about. We went from doing 3-4 outgoing wires a week, to over 20 a day. Getting bank drafts (which have NO hold time) sent out same/next day is working for most of our clients. Its only temporary and we should have this fixed shortly.
Edit: shortly as in days, not weeks. We can already initiate automated CAD wires, just waiting for the OK on USD wires.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:56:22
Vault of Satoshi is a good option ;)

API is coming, just being pre-tested.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:46:06
Sorry bout the mystery, we were curious to see how close people would get it!  We're going to be doing a bigger test this weekend on production hardware, so listen for it! :D
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:47:13
BTC can be transfered in and out, although currently - you need to ensure you are using TestNet wallet addresses.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:46:06
Fixed the CDN/CAD/USD issues, also removed the 2 week notice.  We just weren't sure if a hold would be put on a wire if it were over 2 weeks - we'll have this worked out tomorrow when they open to see if its true.
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:23:44
Just replied, send me your BTC or LTC address and we'll fix this for you! :)
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:46:29
I SAID GOLD, GOLD FOR YOU RIGGGGHHHHHTTTTTTTTT MEOWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:50:34
Well you're getting gold... and maybe I will Bitcoin tip you later once I am a bit more relaxed!

We added an email, as well as modified that sentence to what was actually meant: * All proof of residence must have been issued in the last 180 days, ID will be valid depending on the expiry date shown.

What was the previous record?

Checked, fixed and tested on 
Can you re-verify?  Please send your details to hello - we'll likely fire you something over in the next two weeks.

hello - give it one last try, and then send the screen shots.
Thanks for the help.
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:32:44
I'll speak to my business partner today and see what I can do.  This crossed my mind more than once, but I can only hope that  people would do this for the good of the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:23:38
You nailed it!
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:28:05

We're adding CAD shortly - just a couple things to work out. We opened with USD as it's the most used currency in the world, we are in Toronto - but are a Global exchange.
Withdrawing hasn't been an issue: cheque/money order/wire, more coming to satisfy everyone.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:37:14
Ok cool, things look ok form our side.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:22:23
Verifications are same day generally. We've just finished moved into our office today and phones are going in now. It's pretty hectic - we're a tad behind but catching up as things clear up around the office.
If it has been more than 12 hours, please email support, I've hired a ton of them to make this a lot better for 
@_date: 2013-11-02 22:55:03
So far it's been bringing the USD in loads, just need to coins to complete the cycle!
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:20:44

We'll get the spelling fixed, we're looking into the underlying system "knee jerk" reacting to weird characters... will update you soon! :)

From the original thread: 
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:36:45
If you're after trading, you should use someone else for now, currently it's open to the people who are willing to try and break/hack/test the system out and share the results with us - they're making our world better for your future! ;)

@_date: 2013-11-28 22:30:57
This is Mike from Vault of Satoshi, we are in fact taking cash deposits. We're a little behind as you can imagine. The fact is, we are still quicker than any exchange right now for bringing money in (as far as I've heard) and we're aiming to have everything done in 12 hours or less - which is about 4.5 days quicker than other exchanges I've dealt with personally.
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:54:34
We are adding these over the next couple weeks - as well as yubi key.

Great concern, we're still looking at several options currently. 
@_date: 2013-02-05 02:10:15
Currency exchange, with options such as BTC to Cash, Gift Card, PrePaid Master Cards, etc.
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:03:40
Thanks for the input! :)  I'll have those looked after... like a boss!

Good job - we're using Apache, PHP w/APC all on AWS.  Our stack is inside an Amazon VPC over two subnets - 1 public which you're looking at, and a private subnet that is connected via Hardware VPN to our colo at 151 Front St. in Toronto Ontario ( 
Our production stack, which you don't see uses Amazons scaling abilities which we have configured to grow the stack as resources are needed - mostly scripted in Puppet. There is a second failover system setup on Rackspace in case there is an Amazon outage.  The production Environment also utilizes CloudFlare.
Our Database servers sitting in a cage a stone throw from Toronto Stock Exchange servers, Royal Bank and TD Servers. Our secondary datacenter is north of the City.
There is a pile more interesting stuff going on here, but there is also a lot of work to do.  I hope this setup meets your expectations.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:25:45

Thanks, well hopefully good will come of it, and I don't get  kidnapped by DR_McBUTTFUCK at Timmies... 
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:29:00
Planning, what is this planning business? Seriously, we're able to do business with US customers - nothing tricky here except the verifications.
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:00:44
You're TOTALLY RIGHT!!  THAT IS MADNESS... have some gold.
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:45:55
You sending it to hello We use Zendesk and so far have responded to all emails. If for some reason we did miss it - sorry, we'll look through, best to send it again.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:35:40
Looking into this
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:35:41
You can send and receive TestNet bitcoin from the withdrawl/deposit screens.  Every account is given $1000.00 to play with.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:54:27
We want a global market, and BTC Toronto didn't fit that. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:27:46
Touch this dirty gold!
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:37:05
If they want to list us... they will. Don't want to chase anyone down, been doing that for the last month.
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:46:42
What? No! Of course not... this is not a ploy move on take your gold.
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:47:08
Yea, it will be a few days I think until the big wires clear.
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:24:17
Funny enough, we still get cash deposits- just depends on it the teller reads the notes or not on the account.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:51:34
Not at all, thanks for the input!  
@_date: 2013-10-18 19:26:42
This is taking too long... can't a man just give the gold out?
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:36:49
It shouldn't be too hard to see the stack, I challenge you to find out!! :D  The production environment (which is currently offline) is very scalable.  The test environment you see here is scalable but capped.
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:32:39
Sorry I may have just ruined it for you...
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:12:40
Come and hammer out some frustration with us: 
@_date: 2013-07-31 12:41:16
Going live in September.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:59:32
I hear you, do you know what black magic I had to do to buy LTC last week?
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:28:03
Its strange, I heard a couple branches were doing this, but when I was on our branch they never heard of it. I think it must be at a branch level. Basically, you can create a deposit request, it will give an amount - see if you can deposit that exact amount. Doing that and sending a photo of the receipt (or at least the details) should get your deposit in within an hour or two at the most.
@_date: 2013-10-18 19:24:12
I am not LOL'ing... but let this gold stamp help us bring something better! :D
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:24:49
My mail box is a write off here on reddit, sorry we missed you!
@_date: 2013-04-19 11:17:37
That's not a TestNet account - that's a real address, which we are not supporting until testing is over.
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:17:12
Wires &amp; Checks (spelled Cheques where I am from). More ways to come eventually.
@_date: 2013-11-01 15:30:12
Health cards are fine. I'll have a look at Birth Certificate... its definitely not a valid photo ID :)
@_date: 2013-10-18 19:29:23
This one should be inserted from the back.
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:45:59
Litecoin is in testing, and the others are in development! ;)
@_date: 2013-02-05 18:08:58
Yea there were a couple with them too.  Best of luck, and if you need any scans I'd be happy to test for you any time! 
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:49:53
Twilio seems to be having some issues, try the email 2FA in the mean time - going to add a backup for SMS today.
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:50:47
We can, it just takes us 20 minutes a wire in the branch. We're waiting for the automated software from our Bank so we can do this without living at the Branch. This is a temporary growth problem. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:17:43
You're talking nonsense now... 
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:01:33
I just went through these, we're pretty new to Zen Desk. 
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:25:02
Our site works on Mobile perfectly.. as for an app... maybe some day.
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:26:42
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:51:30
We're likely going to be integrating with QuickBT for another deposit method.
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:11:14
haha, I was about to one-up you on this and realized I am a business guy after today...
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:14:11
Depends on where you live, if in Canada free cash deposits via BMO. Cheques are free also. Wires only cost our bank fee of $14.00 on our end.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:17:02
Thanks!  We're looking into it, have an answer shortly...
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:22:56
Wire or Cheque... we just received a wire from a US customer and took only 48 hours. More options will be added soon.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:19:38
I have a guy doing integrations, I'll add this to his pile!! :D


@_date: 2013-04-18 16:54:48
We got the email, thanks for the heads up- square you up once the challenge is completed, in the mean time, have some GOLD!
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:02:33
We have a lot of Americans on our exchange, we handle deposits and withdraws fairly quickly. A few customers wires come in same day - not sure how, but they do.
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:56:12
Depending on the quality of the exploits we may issue more prizes.
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:57:13
haha best comment ever!
@_date: 2013-02-07 02:43:17
Update: I'm doing it.  If you see anything you don't like, let me know.  I'm meeting with lawyers this week, I have the basics up now.
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:48:52
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:19:00
Don't use us... just take the gold!
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:57:28
hello - I think it's been reported, but send nonetheless... 
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:07:16
Thanks, we do too! :)
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:24:39
Rob is too busy smoking crack!
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:11:03
well, its 0.5% on your transaction - plus the others 0.5%
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:52:35
It's USD ;)
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:03:16
I'd like to say, we're promoting to the future generations... but I think that would fail miserably!  I'll have that fixed.
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:03:56
Yes! (more details to come when I have them)
@_date: 2013-10-07 22:04:39
We'll get something setup for PGP this week.
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:37:56
The secondary coins will be online, we're going to introduce one at a time to be sure they get all the attention they deserve.  
The automated withdrawal systems are being considered, I'll check out the ticket system and see what stage its at.
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:49:16
Not true, we send out cheques for any amount. If you want a wire however, there is a minimum.
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:16:08
This is no time for questions!
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:54:21
Can you submit a bug to hello link the email address also.
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:40:40
Is steam taking BTC yet?!?!
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:29:34
I think so, its jus starting to get the attention finally. Hopefully it will stop fluctuating on Mt. Gox's news... Happy Cake day... have a gold!
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:23:30
Thanks for the feedback, we're going to have some meetings and see what and where we can move to as far as offer something different. We have been able to quickly add features and other things, so perhaps you'll see a post announcing some very great things soon! 
Again thanks for the input! 
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:12:54
Virtex is right on with what they say about Canadian banks. We've already had to move Banks (before we went live!!). We're always looking for alternative routes though like anyone else.
We're lawyered up with smart council, so we've been taking our time with decisions and not planning to get gutsy.
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:34:43
2 weeks for the prizes, although we're keeping the hackathon going from 
30 days from today 
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:30:16
- We're taking down the barrier in the next few days.
- You found an API bug! We're fixing it! :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:23:24
We've always charged $15.00 for incoming wires. It's our banks way of saying they love us. Free options are cheque/check.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:31:23
We'd certainly look at doing this, but with caution! ;)
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:51:28
I'll take a look at that Fancy icon later... 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:51:36
A developer traded his life for that GOLD comment - lol!  I personally fixed that bug for you! :D
@_date: 2013-10-18 19:22:05
Lets get this shit front page!
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:59:39
We'll take a look - we usually get back to any questions within the hour. You can also email me directly if it takes longer at mike
@_date: 2013-10-18 19:17:44
BOOOOM GOLD TO THE NARDZ
@_date: 2013-05-06 15:26:25
I'll take a look
@_date: 2013-11-10 17:03:44
We have secure upload available on the site, you don't have to use PGP to send us your data.
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:51:40
We're adding CDN currency in about two weeks time.
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:54:13
PARTY THAT PNG UP! :D
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:17:03
Hacker hacks the site, only to lock himself out- HAVE SOME GOLD!
@_date: 2013-11-01 14:28:56
Hate to hi-jack this thread, so I will make this quick. If you are with BMO you are able to do cash deposits with Vault of Satoshi (vaultofsatoshi.com) verifications are pretty quick.
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:40:44
We'd consider a Pre-Loaded Card as payment! But we're not much into payment reversals :/
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:40:39
Removed mod-security to make it more fun... try it again!
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:51:20
LET US EXPOSE GOLD FOR THE GLORY OF REDDIT!
@_date: 2013-11-13 03:44:27
Its much less, but databases usually reserve more than they need for the record :/
@_date: 2013-11-01 17:17:01
We have an invite however, we're looking for some tight integration (Vault of Satoshi) Please have someone email us: hello
@_date: 2013-10-31 04:24:54
Vault of Satoshi has a comprehensive API - be nice to see it added here.
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:17:15
We'll be doing a bitcoin tip-fest soon...
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:12:45
We only charge a 0.0005 network fee.
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:31:51
Someone said that We have the Gold of coin (BTC), the silver of coin (LTC)... we could be missing the Bronze... not for long though! ;)
@_date: 2013-10-18 23:16:28
Tonight a developer dies... I'll fix that.
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:40:13
Try again, Removed mod-security to make it more fun...
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:09:54
We have Goldagra.
@_date: 2013-11-03 13:08:55
You're correct, we are adding Market orders in the next couple weeks, and shortly after that short trades and margins.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:39:17
We're releasing this info soon! :)
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:16:34
Hooray to exchange competition ~~in Canada!~~ on planet earth.
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:13:44
One can only sit back and laugh as their exchange is "taking it".  The comments are coming from a guy watching the inactivity in the Cloudflare control panel :O
@_date: 2013-10-18 19:43:59
haha now that is funny!
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:16:17
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:00:43
Thanks, I'll give this a whirl!
