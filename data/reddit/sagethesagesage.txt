That doesn't preclude him from saying something wrong. But I don't think I'd mind the exposure.

I think his point hinges on the fact that (according to my very rough estimates) 1% is "only" something like $65 million. Not a lot of companies can swing that kind of manipulation, but some absolutely exist, especially those that already have tons of bitcoin laying around instead of dollars, etc.

Or get lucky.
@_date: 2014-02-16 20:26:24
Fair enough.

You may not be wrong, but the point you make is totally irrelevant. I use it as my main OS, but I'll admit that the reason it's never the target for viruses is because few people use it. It may be more secure, but it's never dealt with the onslaught of hackers that Windows has.

True. My "never" was a bit hyperbolic.

Compared to the aforementioned alternative? Yes. By a wide margin.
It's shitty, unfair, etc. Sure. And I'd much rather it didn't work out like this, but it's better than some of the alternatives.

To be fair, a good number of people in this thread do not appear to be looking at it as anything less than permanent.

That's pretty broad though. Can a minor make cash deposits (like through walmart, 7-11, etc.)?

What's a scare tactic? I understand the term and the definition you've linked to, but what has someone said that fits the description? 
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:53:53
Less than 1% of stores accept bitcoin, so I guess we should just disregard crypto altogether. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:27:13
No, I understand the term, I'm asking what specific thing he's referring to that is a scare tactic. What has he seen that fits that description? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:59:08
Hey, what's the exact origin of this HODL thing? I get the misspelling, but is it from a specific post?
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:20:24
respek tho
@_date: 2013-03-11 17:27:29
Who do you guys ship through?
@_date: 2013-03-11 20:05:13
Yes, I meant the anon package. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-10-04 00:00:38
Awww, shit
@_date: 2013-03-19 16:05:07
Oh I don't have anything against SRotD, and I can' t imagine those effects are intentional by any means. Not trying to blame you guys. Keep up the great work.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:37:39
I'm glad you feel comforting.

Its funny how some subreddits get positively trounced on by subreddit of the day and people who don't get it (specifics will go unmentioned for that very reason) while bitcoin here will benefit greatly. Just thought it was interesting.
