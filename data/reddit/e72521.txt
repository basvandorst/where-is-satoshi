When might the BlockParty Block Explorer be ready?

I'd look at what Swarm are doing. They are utilizing the Counterparty Protocol for crowdfunding. They regularly pay out tokens proportionally to how much of some other token a user holds. They do this for voting and such. In your case it would be tipping. Many of the Bitcoin 2.0 protocols have a dividend feature.
I think you just need to more clearly and concisely define what you are trying to do and research all the tools that the various protocols have available. You'll come up with a complete solution for your application in now time.

When might we see Trezor support (or other hardware wallet) for Counterwallet?

You can update it now. Source:

A fee to the entire network. The fee will be destroyed/burned so everyone's XCP holdings will be worth a little bit more.
@_date: 2014-11-28 21:07:09
There are two tiers of Asset Name - Human Readable (alphabetic) and Human Un-readable (numeric). The Numeric Assets are free to issue. The Alphabetic Assets still have the 0.5 XCP spam prevention fee. This will deter squatting as usual.
Best of both worlds.
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:57:54
The Counterparty Protocol may not always be based on the Bitcoin Blockchain. XCP can be migrated successfully to other Blockchains if required. Having the supply fixed facilitates this flexible migration potential.
Bitcoin's supply will stop too at some point in time. Counterparty just fast forwarded to the future by making it's token generation period shorter.

You can now use BTC exclusively to issue assets on Counterparty, for the price of the usual Bitcoin transaction fee.
One can then trade said assets on the Counterparty Distributed Exchange, again for the price of the usual Bitcoin transaction fee per trade order.

Is there any possibility that the Counterparty team could fork Bitcoin Core to create something like Bitparty, a more neutral progressive implementation of Bitcoin that allows for improved integration of Counterparty itself?
@_date: 2014-12-04 18:15:34
For the purposes of asset issuance the Counterparty Protocol is tolerant of blockchain re-orgs. And that is the premise of this "comparison" no?
If you own the private key you can spend the Counterparty asset. Just like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-28 19:51:14
Sidechains have been described as "alt-chains without the alt-coins". In a sense Counterparty is the opposite - "alt-coins (assets) with out the alt-chains (all Counterparty data is embedded in the Bitcoin Blockchain)".
Because one can issue assets on the Counterparty Protocol (secured by the Bitcoin Blockchain without having to manage/secure a new alt-chain) lots of applications can spring up:
Issue an in-game currency
Issue a commodity currency or local currency
Issue loyalty points
Issue shares in a project
All of these types of token can immediately be traded on the embedded Distributed Exchange against any other token (including BTC and XCP).

Any chance of a CounterParty data torrent set up by one of the founders? See here for a corresponding reliable Bitcoin data torrent -  - set up by Jeff Garzik.
@_date: 2014-11-17 20:44:25
Great, thanks. I'll see what I can do wrt hosting the torrent. I still think it would be better coming from one of you three well known/respected CP founders.
No problem. Just to expand for anyone else who is interested - One application of that Serpent Checksum / Checkpoint idea is potentially a way for people to download the CP data only without running a full Bitcoin/Counterparty node and still being able to trust that the data is legit.
Edit: I'm wondering is this something like what Factom are doing? 
@_date: 2014-12-04 17:48:02
This is inappropriate advice.
[1] One should never discard a private key. It is bad practice.
[2] One cannot simply delete a private key. See "Data Remanence".
[3] One cannot provably discard a private key.
Basically you cannot "delete your private key", nor should you.
TL;DR You CANNOT provably lock issuance of an asset with this implementation of Colored Coins. I.e. You CANNOT enforce scarcity with this implementation.
@_date: 2014-11-28 19:20:46
Not a minor update actually. And very relevant to Bitcoin - now users can take advantage of asset issuance and the decentralized exchange using BTC exclusively.
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:37:04
Now that we have Serpent integrated with the Counterparty Protocol, might some native Counterparty functions be removed and essentially replaced by their corresponding Serpent code to make the Protocol even more streamlined and manageable?
@_date: 2014-11-28 20:15:50
The top-level link might be more apt - 
@_date: 2014-11-17 22:19:38
Kraken would be ideal. Their CEO mentions Counterparty here - 
@_date: 2014-11-28 21:44:11
There is no additional security requirement for Counterparty to achieve consensus. It inherits all of Bitcoin's security by being embedded in the Blockchain.
Counterparty does add value to the Bitcoin Blockchain. See above. Bitcoin users can use most of Counterparty's core functionality frictionlessly.

There appear to be some major misunderstandings by all sides in this particular "comparison". I would encourage everyone to perform their own due diligence and not to pay too much attention to a report prepared by any one project.
@_date: 2014-11-17 22:03:36
The bit that you are missing is that the fess aren't actually given directly to XCP holders, they are burned/destroyed. So it's more like all XCP holders' (big and small) value goes up because there are less XCP in circulation.
@_date: 2014-11-17 23:43:36
Both! They are one and the same.
"The simplest and most robust way to make this payment will be just to destroy the fees, and to thereby reduce the money supply, as this is equivalent to paying the fee out to all holders of XCP in proportion to the size of their holdings."

The current level of Counterwallet and Bitcoin Armory interaction has been invaluable - 
Is a "Counterparty Armory" or Counterparty plugin for Bitcoin Armory on the horizon?
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:21:45
How can we trust this if you don't provide hashes of the archive and something like a PGP signature to know that it came from you. Surely a torrent would be better than relying on S3. I would do it myself but it would only really make sense coming from one of the founders.
If would be great if with the Serpent language a checksum was done periodically of the current state of all Counterparty Data. This would help ensure that the torrent is legit.
@_date: 2014-11-28 21:15:48
You need to start thinking about Bitcoin in terms of layers. Specifically, the protocol layer and the application layer. The job of the protocol layer is to provide simple cohesive rules that the application layer can interface with to achieve the kinds of functionality that you are looking for.
The exact example you gave is outlined by Andreas here -  He talks about using multi-sig technology to ensure that items get delivered before payment is made.
