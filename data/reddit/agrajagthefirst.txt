For using sites, yes I think generally so. I could access circle before the international roll out, but obviously it needed a US bank account so couldn't do anything. And then for any physical items they are locked to the country so there's no international shipping options. 
The thing is when you see awesome news like "Microsoft accepts Bitcoin" but it doesn't apply to 96% of the world population.

All I want is to not have less money than I started with. My average buy in is around $450 and I can't face spending that below that value.
I still use bitcoin for stuff, but I'll buy it and spend it in short time, and leave those first coins for a better day.

I think the next major change will come when we hear about companies paying each other with bitcoin. 
When Microsoft pay the Chinese xbox manufacture pant in bitcoin that they received in sales, or $supermarket pays for their Time magazine deliveries in bitcoin that they took in sales.
It'll reduce the amount of insta-fiat conversions that are going on, save these companies money and stop the market flooding.

I think you might mean 'faucet', which is an American word for '[tap]( It's called that because it literally drips bitcoin and newcomers can get some free. Usually done by people wanting to entice new users for philanthropy or profit.
The blockchain wallet has had a bit of security warnings recently so might not be the best one to stick with. Also, Coinbase acts more like a bank: They are holding on to your coins for you. If you want to spend/send your bitcoin then you ask them to do it and they do.
If you want to hold on to your coins directly, personally I'd recommend the [mycelium]( android app but there are loads of other options.

You're just spamming them trying to get people to care about your memecoin. They're not against the "crypto revolution" when they're even using the blockchain to pick a winner and telling people to donate in bitcoin or doge.
Also, I'm not sure that you're really up on the "Crypto revolution" when I see you writing things like:

You could set up a dead man's switch for your email, so that if you don't log in for 6 months (or whatever time you choose) it will email a contact or number of contacts with the private keys or multisig parts, and instructions.
@_date: 2015-01-01 11:30:08
I think the next 'bubble' won't be half as big as the last times though because the infrastructure now in place will stop the artificial holds. 
I think the price will seriously start to rise when companies which accept bitcoin realise that they deal with others, and if they stop converting directly to fiat they can deal with each other cheaper.
More companies will want in on the bitcoin game, and it will reduce the leaking market from straight-to-fiat purchace conversions.

I guess I'm a bag holder then (never heard that term before). I bought at ~$500 on the way up, then again on the way down.

Here is where the argument about 'red caviar' not actually being caviar goes. 
Champagne is only champagne if it's from the champagne region, otherwise it's just sparkling wine. 
Caviar is only caviar if it's from one particular sturgeon species, otherwise it's just fish eggs.

I had a similar situation. But I accept that it would have been a waste of time to train every staff member on the system.
When I said I wanted to do my transaction (I was selling a second hadn phone to them) with bitcoin they had to go get "the bitcoin guy" who had been trained, and he brought the manual with him. It worked ok, but I had to read out my address while they typed it in. No camera or NFC... I was only the second person to try, and they'd been accepting it for about a month.
I don't think it's really their fault if not all the staff are educated *right now* as it's still a minor revenue stream for them. As more customers want to use it then they will be forced to train more staff.
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:30:05
Also, saying he was "let go" because "cryptocurrency is not a part of reddit's near-term plans." sounds a lot better on a CV that being fired and that would be bad for the guy and go against reddit's friendly corporation look.
They probably said "you're going, but we'll let you can go with some dignity".
@_date: 2015-07-28 23:08:34
Hey, if you're in the UK it's really easy at the ATMs, and most don't need any verification or anything. Also, quite a few CeX shops have them in now, which is pretty legitimate.
I used the one in Cardiff a while ago and it was simply £20 in the slot, and bitcoin straight to my wallet. Easily the easiest way, but you pay a few % for the service.
The coindesk site is out of date for my area at least. I've always found  to be better, so check out that too.

What's this fee? I haven't seen that. What am I missing? 
@_date: 2015-04-08 15:31:37
Two issues I don't think people have covered in the comments is medication supply. 
Firstly, who is to say that what you purchase is legit and not contaminated/cut with other stuff. With illicit substances people take that risk but if you're already sick then taking unknown concentrations of potentially mixed substances could really harm you.
My second thought is one of markets. While some of the most common meds are readily available, it's not like a Doctor has access to a wide range, and a third person acting as a supplier would need to have access to a large catalogue which isn't likely or profitable. This would probably lead to loads of people selling the easily obtained stuff, but no-one would market the rare cancer drug that only gets one or two buyers a year because of stockage issues. That is assuming that they're running a 'legit' operation and not just robbing a pharmacy whenever they get an order.
It's a nice idea, but I wonder if the complexities would pan out.

I think that a better model than expecting tipping is a micro payment system.
Imagine that viewing a stream costs 1cent per minute (bitcoin equivalent). To a user that means nothing really, but if a streamer has a hundred people watching, then $1USD per minute is pretty good.
A user is required to load an app wallet with $1USD (of bitcoin) before being allowed to view any paid streams, but people can stream free if they want to (that would help get their profile reputation up, with average view numbers and people writing reviews after seeing them in action). The payment system would avoid dustspam because it would package all viewers' payments into one transaction.
Long term goals could include streamer-defined rates, adding videos for later viewing for a fixed price, comment threads and shit.
My brain example is MKBHD doing a live CES stream. He gets huge youtube numbers for his videos (2.3 million subscribers!), but people want the news immediately, and I imagine a large number wouldn't question 1cent per minute.
An alternative example which would most likely arise is camgirls which would probably be a lucrative business, but I would recommend keeping separate from the main app.
I've just realised how awesome my idea is, so if anyone makes this, I demand 20% of the company.
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:57:02
Is this international or USA only?
@_date: 2015-04-15 14:39:49
Yeah, periscope was released just after I had this idea. I imagine that if they jumped in with two feet, they could really easily add "premium streams" and bitcoin would be infinitely better for this than any other method.
Also it's instantly money-tisable (sp?), and there would be no need for adverts as they could take a % of the micropayments.
Plus, the headline "Twitter's Periscope integrates Hourglass for micropayment of premium streams " sounds awesome.

You're still getting 20% off. It's not like if you buy 20z credit you're never going to buy any more ever again. That credit will last you 20% longer before having to top up again, therefore you save 20%. 
If we were buying one-off purchases then your argument would stand, but in this case it doesn't.

It's a bit hard in the UK because you usually have to wait for SEPA transfers (several days). I've never had circle accept my card after months of waiting. 
My favourite is localbitcoins (kind of like ebay for bitcoin, watch out for dodgy people like you would with ebay) or an atm (London, Cardiff, Bristol, Cambridge, edinborough...). 
Personally, if there's an atm near you, you can buy £5, see how it works, then buy more when you feel confident.

I think some people are missing the sweet spot of this. It's not to replace your main email, it's a secondary one which acts as a filter, which you can use for signing up to stuff where you don't want to get spammed.

Gox, or Gox by another name was always going to happen. As bitcoin got more popular there would inevitably be one site that became the hub of transactions and as with any gold rush, people would see quick money opportunities and jump on the band waggon.
Also inevitable is this opportunistic site being under developed and poorly managed purely due to being created in the amateur days, and never expecting to be under this strain. This caused both technical problems, and not surprisingly with no oversight, human 'error'.
With massive loss, and no alternative avenue the adoption and price would crash down to pre-bottleneck values, but with the new hype and publicity it would have garnered new support from more appropriate and secure parties who are looking to the future.
And thus the first Seldon crisis was weathered as it would always have been, laying the groundwork for new investment in the future.
