Hey guys, just so you know....just because someone has money doesn't fucking mean they know ANYTHING you don't. 
This "Bitcoin Rich and Famous" bullshit has to stop.
...but it won't because OMG RICH PEOPLE KNOW EVERYTHING AND I WANNA BE JUST LIKE THEM.

You are one of those scumbags?

Yay, another anti Trump comment.
Oh, no...surely you've never said anything misogynist, because you have no friends to say it to.
Trump hate is getting so old. Get another dead horse to beat already.

The hamsters that they are breeding wear condoms during practice breeding.
Or something.
Yeah, that makes total sense.
@_date: 2018-12-13 11:39:25
...and you are in the camp of virtue signaling douches that think saying anything positive about Trump at ALL makes you a bigoted Nazi.
Here is a piece of advice for you: Delete Twitter and Facebook...because the need to fit in is fucking with your personality.

And I'm not calling you an asshole. I'm saying your mom's asshole is delicious....like cheesecake.

Amazing series, btw.

You are already in over your head.
Worrying which wallet to use is the LAST thing a Bitcoin ATM operator cares about.

He's actually right.
I can tell you've never managed hundreds of millions of dollars in customer funds....bc you're busy here LOLing at something you have no clue about.

I'm not native either.

No, it wasn't. 
Just because you read it on CoinTelegraph or some equally retarded place, doesn't make it true. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 12:21:41
 did I say this?
Putting words in my mouth to fit your narrative.
But hey, why not? EVERYONE IS A VICTIM.

Lol, you have a "room".
My god I am old.
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:44:12
I remember people like you back in January of 2015.
"IT'S GOING TO $50!" they said
"IT'S GOING TO $0!" they said
...it bounced off of $160 and hasn't looked back.
I swear I feel like I'm living in 2015 all over again. 
New newbs. Same old shit predictions. I fucking love it.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:08:49
Bc it is the truth.
They are stealing land from whitey...bc whitey is to blame for ALL their problems.
KILL WHITEY, AMIRITE?
White farmers should emigrate elsewhere and let those people starve to death.
...and 50 years later, the ones that survive will STILL blame whitey.
Victim mentality losers.
@_date: 2018-12-04 18:45:42
The only person that buys the bottom is newbs...in their mind only with imaginary money. The rest of us average into a position over time because we actually understand timing the market is literally not possible.
Draper bought $30MM in BTC @ $500 a coin and watched it drop to $160/coin 6 months later.
BUT OH NO, **LOL** BECAUSE HE DIDN'T BUY THE BOTTOM. WHAT A FUCKING IDIOT, RIGHT?
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:34:35
Piece of advice: Don't use the word "butthurt"...it makes you sound 14.
Are you 14?

I would like this if the artist wasn't just adding crypto buzzwords to it so he can sell it to all those sucker bitcoin-rich idiots.
A bit like Urban Outfitters selling $100 pre-worn looking jeans to rich kids because that's where the money is.
Remove the crypto buzzwords, and I'd actually buy this.

Stop reading Techcrunch for your technical info, newb.

My Blockfolio has MM's after it.
Yours doesn't. 
So, uhh...stop talking, plz?

I checked. The smallest they have are used for hamster breeding....and that is WAY too big for me.

But I ate them all at once already.
Why god whyyyyyyyyy????
@_date: 2018-12-01 11:28:20
Monero is not a contender for this.
Monero is only useful as a way to wash coins and then go back to BTC. Nobody is holding/using it for anything other than speculation. People use BTC for storing value and actual commerce. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:20:55
They already did, and stock markets haven't majorly sold off yet.
This begs the question, wtf will happen to BTC when the stock market REALLY panics?
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:29:49


Motherfucking exactly.
I love newbs. We need them. They buy me stuff.
@_date: 2018-12-09 22:57:08
Citation needed?
Ok, you're right...the economy is fine. NOTHING TO SEE HERE.
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:00:31
They said EXACTLY this about Trump.
Never underestimate stupidity.
@_date: 2018-12-10 18:55:58


Uhhh, so I guess you're not watching US stock markets?
They are 100% correlated now. When US stocks sell off, so does crypto.
Pay attention.
@_date: 2018-12-14 08:34:45


No, they don't...and they won't. Tone Vays is a retard. 
You are never going to change the fact that what draws most* people to crypto is getting rich quick. They will always chase some shitcoin, somewhere...or whatever the next evolution of these sorts of scam.
Auroracoin circa 2014 -&gt; Paycoin -&gt; ICOs -&gt; ??? What is next?
Shitcoins will ALWAYS exist.

THE BEARTROLL ARMY IS MOUNTING UP AGAIN!
Are you gonna fall for their FUD troll tactics, AGAIN?
@_date: 2018-12-13 09:25:14


You are a newb liar.
Why do people like you pretend you were there when Bitcoin was cheaper? THEN you get the facts wrong...and anybody that was actually there knows you are full of shit.
There was no bubble to $1800....the only thing resembling that was the $1163 Bitstamp bubble in late 2013...not $1800...and it didn't crash to $800...it dropped to $160 in January 2015.
I was there...you weren't. Stop making shit up trying to sound cool...poser.

Fucking South Africa, I swear.
But it's whiteys fault, right?

No, I am just working on my 3rd language now. People like you that go through life never taking any risks of any embarassment...staying in that neat, safe, little cubby hole that is your mom's basement....you're just weak as fuck inside.

Nick is bigoted?
Why, because he is a white male?
OHHHHH NOOOO ALL WHITE MEN ARE RAPISTS AND RACIST HOMOPHOBES.
Now go cry in a corner because daddy wasn't there for you. Go on, get it all out. You'll feel better after.
...but seriously, Nick may be one of the only consistently respectable people in crypto.

Lol, nah...I just have diarrhea today and I only Reddit while I shit.
This is the only reason I would ever talk to you. 
And if you aren't a millionaire in BTC yet...it means you're a newb.
@_date: 2018-12-11 11:06:10
Yes, because rich people are SO MUCH DIFFERENT than everyone else.
With their nonstop tuxedo wearing, lounging on the beach in said tuxedo, with 2 high end prostitutes on each arm, drinking fresh baby blood and plotting how to ruin humanity!
Truth is, rich people are like any other people: **We all want more...and when we get it...MORE.**

Will we fall for it again??
@_date: 2018-12-14 06:45:18
If your only response is "look..a typo", well then your priorities on what is important and what isn't are fucked. Nitpicking over the spelling of "have" makes you look petty, bored....and well, boring.

Asperger's much? Live in an English speaking country bubble, much?
How many languages you speak?
I hear that the internet has a lot of people on it from places that don't speak English as a first language. I also hear that sometimes these people make a best faith effort to communicate in a language not their own...and make mistakes. But that's okay...because at least they have the confidence to try something that puts them out of their comfort zone...and will inevitably make them grow as a person as a result.
But you...well, you know English.
You English speaker, you.

I am learning to fly planes. Getting private pilot license.
I was TERRIFIED of flying when I started. Like, shaking and shit kinda freaked out. Forced myself to continue anyway.
Know what I've learned? Planes are safe as fuck. The more I learn about them, the safer I felt/feel in flight.
My point? Whenever flying freaks you out, just remember you are WAY safer than you may feel. That taxi ride to the airport was a LOT more dangerous than the flight you are on...and even the statistics match this assessment.
Go to Vegas. Fuck it. We all die...and probably sooner than we'd like. It won't be the plane that kills you.

The people in Tijuana right now claiming they are asylum seekers are neither political refugees nor seeking anything other than to make money as paid trolls in order to help their handlers achieve their goal: To disrupt trade routes and fuck with the US Govt
Military vets? Yay...who isn't? Who cares..
Wife a govt lawyer determining claims of refugees? Yeah bruh, cool story. Keep saying it and it'll become true.
If you don't see the fact that this caravan is being funded by some entity solely to fuck with trade routes into the US, well then you are a fucking moron.
I live in Asia. Know what I've learned about the Chinese? They are clever fucks. This caravan thing could 100% be funded by China to specifically cause a knee-jerk reaction by the Trump administration, and thus disrupt normal trade routes to the US from Mexico and Latin America.
Why? Because $50MM to fund an operation like this? WORTH IT. Peanuts for a country like China.
If it's on the news, it's there not to inform you....it is there to MANIPULATE your petty emotions into believing a narrative. Good job buying it, newb. 
Go post your "feelings" on social media somewhere. That way you'll get some FEEEEL GOOOOD Likes and upvotes...which is all losers like you care about anyway: Feeling good when some other moron Likes your virtue signaling bullshit "opinion". 
Fucking loser...get a self esteem. Men don't virtue signal for upvotes. You are fucking lame.
