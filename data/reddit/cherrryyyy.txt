it does - but is there a viable alternative? cashapp makes up for like 1% of diff - might as well find a debit with lowest fees

Great news - as really one way to conveniently convert/use my crypto automatically as if it was cash is a card - 
 
**Debit cards tied to cryptocurrency wallets provide an opportunity to spend your digital coins almost anywhere fiat money is accepted. It’s a working solution, at least until wider adoption comes around. That’s why they’ve become so popular in the crypto community. Challenges of different sorts have negatively affected some of the earlier offerings, but it’s good to see products that have survived and new ones that are gaining traction or are about to enter the market.**
**During the past year, crypto winter forced businesses to downsize and adjust to unfavorable market and regulatory conditions. Many are still trying to adapt and some are already seeking opportunities elsewhere. For example, the company that issued Shift, arguably the first bitcoin debit card in the U.S. which allowed holders to spend from their Coinbase wallet, is not offering it anymore. It’s now operating under a new brand name, Apto Payments. And in Europe, many card providers suffered a hard blow when Visa terminated Wavecrest’s membership – some have recovered, others are yet to return.**
**Not everything is so bleak, however. Trastra is a crypto debit card that’s been available in europe since relatively recently but according to its website, the following is already global. They enable users of the Trastra wallet to spend their digital assets in brick and mortar stores as well as with online merchants through conversion to fiat. You can also withdraw funds in local currency from ATMs in just about any country. The card can be ordered from the platform’s wallet which supports a number of coins including bitcoin core, ethereum, litecoin, dash**
**A growing number of card issuers now support bitcoin cash in their products, with the above-mentioned Bitpay being the most notable example. Other platforms added the cryptocurrency more recently. Crypto.com’s MCO Visa card has allowed you to spend BCH since the end of May, when the Hong Kong-based payment processor announced it had introduced the coin to its wallet and card app. The company started shipping its debit cards to customers in Singapore last October and promised to take them to the U.S. through a partnership between its Florida-registered affiliate Foris Inc. and the Metropolitan Commercial Bank in New York. Its wallet is currently available in 36 states but there’s been no update on the plans for the card itself.**
