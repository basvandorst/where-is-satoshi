the browswer looks great!  is there a method to transfer favorites (from firefox) yet?
Also, can pages be compiled under one app, similar to how windows groups similar items?  I am concerned that I will want to save multiple pages from the same site, and things will get disorganized/cluttered.  please let me know if i am missing something!  I realize that this is very early in the development phase.

I can't tell how serious you are about this claim but would love to hear the rational (not saying you are wrong, just curious) and specifics that brought this conclusion.

Can't tell if purposeful trolling or actual BTC noob...

What about btc-dealer ( They utilize LiqPay for credit/debit transactions.  Anyone tried them?

Yes, It is oddly sporadic... every time I log into blockchain I get an immediate sms verification.  One would think this should be a simple procedure.

First off, I have heard of accounts being hacked that have 2fa...but secondly, I wouldn't store any large amount of bitcoin online anyways.  I am more concerned about the bank account connection because that is where there is potential for alot of USD to be stolen.  I know that bitcoin is still in its infancy but how can more people get into bitcoin if there is such fear of theft?

he's practicing now so in a few years it will be second nature.

This map is awesome.  
Suggestion: It would be great for the developers to make a time lapse view to watch bitcoin taking over the world.

‟But, once one bank stands up and says they’re going to be the Bitcoin bank, everyone else will follow suit. … This may happen within the next year or so.”   EDIT: ideally, "once a bank stands up and says they will exchange bitcoins for you..."

Nope.. and nothing in the spam folder.

the btc atm gave me the idea for the apparently-already-existing-idea for the vending machine.
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:25:38
definately agree.  just looking for a simple response to this typical argument made by those opposing bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:11:58
I see what you did there

I see.  So coinbase has an inadvertent security feature!...shouldn't this feature be advertised somewhere by coinbase?!  Or at least developed so that even with a level 2 account, you can set up as an option?  Am I the only one who thinks this option is a deal-breaker of some sort?
