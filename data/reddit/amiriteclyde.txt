Look at PIGS (portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain) as a case study to what happens to other currencies. That's why I point out the fact it's imperative to have it backed in some manner.

Here is why people were happy it corrected... They made a fortune on it's downturn.

Currencies should be backed by a commodity so in case public opinion changes on the currency, it still has value. The dollar used to be backed by gold, for example. It's not backed by oil but oil is traded in the dollar which gives it merit.

Can you explain what makes Bitcoin have value other than people getting together and agreeing it's valuable? I know the dollar isn't backed by anything but it's still the currency for trading oil (giving it a tremendous amount of weight). What substance does bitcoin have other than being an "alternative" currency?

I have a pretty good rebuttal...


The reason for desire is pertinent. It boils down to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. People value things that keep them alive and allow them to perform basic functions. That's why things like crude oil are based in the dollar. It gives it value even if people agree its worthless because it's imperative to daily life function. Only way the dollar truly fails is if oil truly fails. Ain't happening. The dollar is far more than a promisory note from your US government. It's the backbone of the wold economy.

It's because they really don't understand it. It's why Flint, MI still has contaminated water. Apathy and negligence on behalf of the people.

oh, that's just people confirming their fears to enter the market. My dad for example. Went on and on about tulips and bubbles and didn't want to mess with bitcoin. That guy smelled his own farts with a smile on his face when it tanked 30%
