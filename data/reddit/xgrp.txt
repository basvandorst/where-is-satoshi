So basically it's still mixing, no complete anonymity guaranteed. Not to mention that your scenario require timing works from a big group of people which is very inconvenient. Even BTC-E can help you launder your coins easier than sidechain, just deposit then withdraw across multiple addresses !
@_date: 2015-06-17 17:04:41


So those near-full blocks isn't considered as 'real usage' ?


Seems like you know nothing, you need to get most of people to upgrade their software in a timing act. Even if we could get concensus about block increase by now, it would take us to March of 2016 for real implementation.


oh please, Bitcoin is meant to serve users, not miners. You are thinking miners as everything about Bitcoin ecosystem. Chinese miners are already rewarded naturally by cheap electricity, you shouldn't give them too many advantages in order to help them control Bitcoin even more, that's the centralization we all want to avoid. Are you a Chinese miner any chance ?

darkwallet uses CoinJoin to mix the transactions. Confidental transactions hide the amount only. Personally i think non of these options offer enough privacy.

Even if we could reach consensus right now, it still take roughly 1 yeah to see increased blocksize limit.

Increasing block size limit is not changing the protocol.

In the scenario that only "important transactions" should be done in mainchain, current 1MB limite with 3-7 tps is still not enough. Personally i think we need both approach.

There was already a stress test on the network, i bet you missed it.


OMG increasing blocksize is not an overnight process, you'll never react on time when the transactions start to be clogged.




Nobody say that increasing blocksize is the only solution, it's a part of solution to scale, but the most urgent one. The shiny 'lightning network' won't arrive on time when blocks are full.


Most of businesses will rely on third party services, they don't run their own nodes, no matter what blocksize is.

They didn't receive anything because that announcement might be sent to banks instead to the exchanges. The rumor is about PBC ordered the banks to stay away from Bitcoin exchanges, so that make sense, right ?
@_date: 2014-04-04 17:16:25
I think there will be a solution. For example the change of algorithm will be announced a long time before actual implementation, that'll make ASIC manufacturers and miners to prepare for the change. With current rising rate of difficulty, ASIC machines always obsolete pretty fast, miners will buy a new one if they want to keep up with competition.

No one will bother converting bitcoin/fiat to a random altcoin just to purchase one item at your store ? So you think your customer will: 1) Install another wallet in his computer and take one hell of time to download its blockchain 2) Open an account at a random exchange. 3) Transfer bitcoin/fiat to them. 4) Fill a buy order for a random altcoin. 5) Transfer those altcoins back to their his wallet. 6) Send it to you.
Do you think your customers will going thru all of those steps just for one purchase ? You will lose sales by doing that.
Furthermore, no altcoin has a great payment services built on top of them as Bitcoin. Bitpay/Coinbase did a great job to simplify the process of accepting payment for Bitcoin.

There are quite many people in Bitcoin community disagree with increasing blocksize limit. Increased limit means network can fit more transaction to 1 block, transaction fee would be cheaper and some miners don't like it. Another downside is blockchain size will be MUCH bigger. Blockchain is growing incredibly fast, almost doubled it's size in past year. With future block size limit, it will grow even much faster.


It's not easy as you saying, we need a hard fork to increase this limit. There's always risks in performing a hard fork because Bitcoin is too big now. Worst case scenario can lead to a collapse.
@_date: 2015-07-09 17:11:09


Raising blocksize has nothing to do with preventing these kind of attack. Raising limit = much cheaper fee = more spam tx. I do support bigger block, but what we need here is better spam filter.

Again another 'Email vs Bitcoin' comparison, keep in mind that not all technology become successful, many of them has failed to achieve mass adoption.
Email protocol is now successful technology just because we have centralized but convenient email services like Gmail built on top of that, nobody care about centralization in email services. Bitcoin is another story, centralization is serious problem because it would kill the purpose of its existence. Those easy-to-use centralized services like Coinbase undermine the trustlessness and decentralization, which are the most important characteristics of Bitcoin. Self-management of wallets and private keys is beyond technology acknowledgement of most people.

Some exchanges had to close deposit and withdrawal via bank transfer due to regulation, but we really don't know how are they doing now. We need Chinese here to let us know.

Buying coins with fake fiat wouldn't solve his insolvency, Mark know that and probably he wouldn't do that in first place.
I don't know why you still refuse to believe that Willy triggered 2013 bubble. [One of the analysis]( clearly showed that the bot had huge impact to the market.

If a guy with deep pocket believe in Bitcoin, he probabbly would be in already no matter how difficult it is to acquire coins. People is not lazy if they believe there will be a lot of money to make.

Doubling is not enough, because BRK.A has increased roughly 20% in last 12 months.

Wrong, there are people seeking to bid at lower than market price so they can sell later to make some profits.

No offense but i won't download a random file posted by a random account which was created 18 minutes ago.

Is v2 compatible with wallets and seed words generated by earlier versions ?

I have dumb questions: What's the meaning of this image ? And who is this "Dave" ?

There is a rumor that Okcoin might be go wrong, Chief Technology Officer suddenly left the company. Traders buy to get out and cause a pump on Okcoin. It's just a theory people are discussing at BitcoinMarkets.

Willy bought 250k coins in only 2 months, so it's not like slow motion buying as you think. 250k in **BUY ONLY** direction obviously has serious impact. For the comparison, that amount is nearly twice of the amount that Silbert's SecondMarket has been accumulating **in 2 years** since 2013 till now (roughly 130k). Hourly Willy volume compared to Mtgox volume is [here](

According to what's happening you'll probably wrong next week.

Of course i know Willy was active more than 2 months. But those 250k coins was bought in only 2 months from September to November, equivalently it's like 4200 BTC per day in average. Now explain to me how buying 4200 coins a day in 2 months straight woundn't move the market ? It doesn't matter how many penny or dollar was moved after each sale, those buy orders simply destroyed selling pressure and this is the important thing.
BTCchina was just following MtGox, China only started leading the rally from 700 or so. Prior to that, Gox was the pumper. Every trader watching market closely during that time frame know that.
Now you said you discovered Willy, could you provide me a link or any evidence about your "study" about Willy with the date prior to May 2014 when the first detailed Willy report was released ?

If he lost (or sold) customer's coins when price was low then he would want to buy them back at even lower price. Why would he pump the price to the moon to buy back ? That doesn't solve his problem: insolvency.

Don't you read the articles ? The wallet is Electrum, will be pre-installed in Tails, why would you compare it with a web wallet ?

Obviously there are very few people use Bitcoin as a payment system. Wordpress probably thinks that there is no need to maintain this payment option while they get so few sales.
