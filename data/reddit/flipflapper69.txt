I couldn't roll my eyes harder if I tried. I would have thought this sub bright enough to see through all the propaganda leveled at Wikipedia by US security institutions and Western media. If anyone is 'compromised', it's them

Venezuelan crisis is because of US neoliberal economic imperialism, not socialism.

Yeah this is more just a once off thing but thank you.
Do you know the fastest &amp; cheapest way to liquidate BTC into fiat? Is it possible to do within a day, without using a BTC atm (the only one accessible to me has a 6% fee)?

Does the update apply to android

Are you referring to, for example, the negative externality cost of BTC mining (which generates capital for holders, for no cost to them) on the environment?

Is only BTC held before the private fork to be credited with BTG? Or is it for all BTC held before it goes live to the public?

I'm a major n00b so ignore me, but CoinTree is slightly cheaper (Australian exchange) than Coinbase, by 1% in buying fees if I'm not mistaken, although I believe even CoinTree is relatively high.
If you're not in Australia, I still reckon you could do better for your style. Read around. But as I said, also ignore me. I really have no idea what I'm talking about

I see. Interesting. Thanks

How do u reconcile this method with buy fees
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:37:14
I know I'm just bitter I didn't do the same thing
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:32:18
Seems excessive, surely there's a cheaper exchange?

Hong Kong's taxes don't fund China's colonialism in Xinjiang and Tibet (and Hong Kong)?

What are bitcoin atm fees like? And do you pay the regular miner transaction fee?
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:21:52

I see. Well you gotta do what you gotta do. Hope it pays off for you!
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:33:29
Dem transaction fees tho
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:08:59
Does that mean it's too late to move coins into a wallet that will pay out BTG?

Will it be known by 21mil how many have been lost?
