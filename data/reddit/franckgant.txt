The articles and cover are not giving an accurate description or analysis of crypto in argentina almost nobody is using them they are some investors that hold but nobody is using them to buy things.For adoption would be needed support from the big Banks in the country opening saving and checking account in crypto could happen in a few years when the rest of the world does it.
The crypto market isn,t mainstream at all overthere everybody is saving and investing in dollars nobody trust the pesos and the economic policies of the country but the trend could change and more people could invest in cryptocurrencies.maybe the real estate market or the art market could accept payments in crypto then more will follow

eth has much better products ready to be used and go mainstream like the toshi wallet and plenty dapps already working like dex decentralised Exchange cryptokitties cryptopunks.At the moment rootstock doesn,t bring nothing new is their product working?eth has first mover avantage rootstock was all based on hype rather than what is really implemented

great idea but binance has to do some serious upscaling more customers service the binance website has a lot of bugs the sms authi often isn,t working properly more investment in customers service would be great it,s a good exchange

yes the next g20 in argentina is going to be very bullish for bitcoin people will talk regulation to let the tech develop and reserve currency adoption by all countries.germany and france are very in favor of bitcoin.there is a lot of inflation in this región and their money is not worth much everybody is using the us dollars maybe they should start to use bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:02:41
great idea but since the hack the binance website isn,t working properly the sms authi is often not functioning binance needs to do some mejor upscaling work to become a top Exchange maybe more customers service support?any thoughts?
