Next week? Last I checked, it's still in the process.

Good business? Keeps its finances in cryptocurrencies? Pick one.

It's getting to the point where I've seen prebuilts cheaper than the GPUs they contain.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:43:19
I find all the people who are still calling this a minor correction hilarious. It was 20k a month and a half ago, and now it's about 7k. That is not a "minor correction" to anyone who isn't in denial. Sure, it may recover someday, but there nothing minor about that.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:46:49
...oh. huh. Serves me right for not checking the date. I guess hindsight is 20/20.
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:48:44
No, I have actually had a correction that hostile. The guy who made it deleted the post within a minute, though, so I guess they recognized how they were acting.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:45:29
And I saw that about 10k a little before that. And 15k, and... well, pretty much every number below 20k. I wonder what makes him feel this time is different?

Just wait until it goes into the negatives, and then get money to take bitcoin off of people's hands.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:36:17
Yeah, just sitting here waiting for people to stop obsessing over crypto mining so GPUs can go back to normal prices. If it takes the death of crypto for that to happen, so be it. I care a whole lot more about being able to build a half-decent computer than I do about crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:49:53
Sure, but a whole lot more people dealt with the 19K to 6K than with the 2011 one. Bitcoin was basically unknown back then, but now everyone's watching it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:45:03
It was 20k a month and a half ago, and now it's 7k. I assume these people are looking at the overall trend, not the weekly chart.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:40:42
Personally, I just check in every now and then to gauge the denial levels. They've been pretty strong over the past month, but I think the realization that this isn't a "minor correction" and "nothing to worry about" is starting to set in.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:42:18
You'd only double what you started it if it went back up after buying in. You could also just lose that money instead. Maybe if you bought bitcoin and then somehow took the bitcoin back in time it'd double.

GPUs aren't just used for gaming, y'know. Also, RIP Xbox.
I take it you haven't actually played any games, if that's your interpretation of gaming?
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:10:51
Of course they're spouting that off, they have a lot riding on it not failing. It's funny the mental gymnastics people will go through to "predict" the outcome that will benefit them most.
Price rising? Buy bitcoin, it's totally gonna keep rising. Price dropping? That means it's a good opportunity to buy bitcoin at a lower price, and that it'll help it keep rising. Price staying the same? Just indicates that it'll start to rise a bunch. There is no possible situation in which these people will admit that there's a chance it'll keep dropping.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:33:39
That's what bubbles tend to do.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:49:56
Haven't really bought any since it was 10k or so, so not too bad. Been too busy.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:36:23
That's called an ASIC, and it's basically the standard method of mining bitcoin these days. So, yeah, you're completely right, and that's what people did. GPUs are still used for a lot of altcoins, though.

It turns out Far Cry is not actually a dictionary.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:35:12
It could go up from there, sure, but it could also go to $1, so I wouldn't count on it.

Sure, blockchains as a technology might rise in value, but it seems unlikely that bitcoin as a currency will, in the long run. The smart thing to do if you think blockchains are a revolutionary thing that will change the world would be to invest in companies which are making good use of them, not buying a token with no inherent value. In the event that you're right, and bitcoin (not cryptocurrency, bitcoin) does end up becoming the new standard currency, I still don't see any actual reason to buy and hold it right now, based on a few things.
- The currency which ends up being most popular may not even be bitcoin. It'd be pretty weird in any technology if the very first adopter of it wound up being the final, most popular one.
- Even if it stabilizes someday (and it will have to stabilize before it has even the slightest chance of being taken seriously as a currency by the general public), there is no guarantee that it'll stabilize at such a ridiculously high value. Even if it does, the tendency of most currencies is to lose value over time, not to gain value (which is good, because a currency that constantly gains value is an awful currency).
Even if bitcoin is, long-term, going to become an actual currency which is used by people (and I don't mean "blockchain technology", I mean bitcoin specifically), there's no question that the current price spikes are speculative bubbles, and they offer zero guarantee of what the eventual price will be when (and if) it settles down.
Even if it's magically adopted as an official currency by every country tomorrow, that's not a guarantee of a long-term upward trend. If anything, most currencies inflate over time. Even discounting that, a few speculative bubbles don't mean a whole lot in terms of the price it'll eventually stabilize at.
Maybe that argument would have worked back when it was really cheap and unknown to all. Well, people know about it now.
My "mental gymnastics" comment was mostly directed towards the people who constantly insist that it's going to start rising in the immediate future. I know you've seen them here. The type that immediately started posting charts as soon as bitcoin started dropping from 20k saying "Here's a cherry-picked point in bitcoin's previous history where it did something vaguely similar and then exploded upwards, obviously the same thing is happening here".
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:50:18
Well, that currently seems to be what everybody believes. It's definitely way too unstable at the moment to be used as currency in any meaningful way.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:46:16
The question is, is it also where the strong hands and their money get separated?
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:50:45
I'd believe it more if I hadn't seen similar predictions saying it was going to start rising again after it dropped to 15k, or 10k, or 8k.
