I am 17 still in school and I bought 4.49 bitcoins for a bit over two weeks ago, but have been following this sub and the bitcoin from april. Probably one of the youngest on here.

Haven't done the donating thing yet :), but I have a little amount on my phone so I can get friends into bitcoin. I usually send them enough to buy the humble bundle and after that a couple of them have bought bitcoins themselves.

Don't know if its the Norwegian market being easy to profit from or what, but in the last 3 days i have made about 200$ worth in bitcoins on daytrading. I have yet to lose any cash on it, but the day will come!
