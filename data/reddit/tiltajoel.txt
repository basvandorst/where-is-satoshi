A few thoughts... 
I think that biodiversity is valuable in that it represents billions of years of accumulated evolutionary innovations. This includes useful plants and fungi that can be used as medicines, ecosystem services like water filtration and disease absorption, etc... Not to mention the natural beauty of life's variety. To the degree we are destroying biodiversity through habitat destruction, environmental pollutions, etc..., we're losing an incredibly valuable natural resource. Many scientists describe what is currently occurring as the sixth major mass extinction in the last 542 million years. I'd like to be on a path that avoids causing further mass extinction. 
I think that climate stability is another valuable service that is provided through a complex interplay of physical and biological processes on the surface of the earth. A stable climate is valuable for food production, reliable water availability, and for creating liveable environments. While there are certain advantages to an atmosphere with higher concentrations of greenhouse gases (like plant fertilization), these are probably outweighed by the disadvantages such as jet-stream destabilization, increased storm strength, increased drought frequency (and increased wildfire frequency), and ecosystem collapse.

I think of the earth as more than a ball of rock.

I agree that humans are powerless with regard to killing a ball of rock. What we're destroying is the things on its surface.

While it's true that the internet incubates minor hate-filled websites that incite vile, sometime nationalistic behavior, by and large the nature of internet technology is distributive. Most importantly, the technology is extremely young in world historical terms, and distributed currencies are even younger.

What about structuring the core software to treat the entire mining network as a pool, so that mining awards are continuous based on hashing power contributed. In other words, you're not receiving a flat fee for solving a block, but a percentage of the total proportional to your hashing power. Isn't this basically how it works now within mining pools? 
@_date: 2014-06-26 05:12:16
I would like these things to be true and I see how they *could* become true. That is, that bitcoin facilitates a new era of financial transparency. 
However, I think it's just as plausible that bitcoin goes hand in hand with globalization and hyper-financialization, two trends that are not exactly the friend of the working man — at least as they are currently practiced. 
Perhaps in a bitcoin world economy where literally every person is an investor, we will see shareholders rein in the worst abuses of global corporations, and perhaps in a world where bitcoin elucidates the inner financial workings of states, taxpayers will begin to regain control of public spending. On the other hand, bitcoin might make it possible for corporations and states to fully obscure their finances (even more than they already have), and usher in a new age of immoral profit-seeking and corruption. In my mind, both paths are possible, and much depends on the development of the technology and the regulatory framework within which it resides.

Report: This title gearing up to accept the word "to"
@_date: 2014-06-11 04:59:40
The problem with this line of thinking is that it challenges you to think of bitcoin from a moral perspective. 
I think a more apt paradigm is natural selection. Does Bitcoin have an enhanced "fitness" compared to fiat currency? The answer seems to be up for grabs. On the one hand, since the decentralized network adds resiliency, decreases monetary friction, and offers innovation advantages as compared to central bank fiat currency, it has competitive advantages. At the same time, there are potential flaws: an inelastic monetary supply can be a blessing and a curse, irreversible transactions are tricky in a careless, but ubiquitously interconnected world, and the viability/veracity of the software and the network hinge upon the good will of individual actors. 
Now, if you accept that bitcoin has the competitive advantage (which I believe it does), then its future ubiquity becomes a foregone conclusion, and the discussion shifts to questions like, "How do you map inequality in the blockchain?" (Simple, by making histograms and probability plots of transaction size. Note that this kind of transparency was never possible with bank transactions.). "How do you control inequality?" (A global wealth tax is a political discussion, and there's no reason it couldn't occur under the bitcoin protocol. Whether such a tax is a good idea is a separate question.) 
The bottom line is that Bitcoin might be the best tool we've ever had for understanding and mapping income inequality. One of the key results of Piketty is that inequality is extremely hard to measure around the world, and this lack of information and transparency is itself a driver of inequality. If people don't know, they can't stand up and demand a change. 
With Bitcoin, inequality becomes glaring. I'm sitting here watching the block chain, and there are $40,000 transactions occurring side by side with transactions for $3.50. I've literally never seen this kind of information about how money is moving before, and to be frank, it's not a great feeling to know that individuals are shuffling around $10,000's of dollars, while others are starving on the streets. 
If anything, Bitcoin is the catalyst for the type of world in which a global wealth tax becomes politically palatable, because, for once, people can see with their very own eyes just how uneven the world financial landscape really is.

Because it has a lot of time for trial and error. Natural selection is an incredibly powerful process for producing useful innovations. 


These are questions that each person needs to answer individually, hopefully with the benefit of the full extent of available information. I personally find a mushroom that glows in the dark more beautiful than a steel tower. Another person might have a different opinion. 


Instability does lead to rapid evolution. The global inferno that annihilated the dinosaurs opened the door for the age of the mammal. There are big losers and big winners. It's not clear that humanity would be a big winner in the case of ecosystem collapse and rapid climate change.

* Mining.... I think of mining as essentially replacing the banking sector. Mining isn't a particularly great way of getting coins, given how competitive and expensive it is. On the other hand, mining does provide a great financial service, at relatively low cost compared with traditional banking. 
Early adopters... It's hard to imagine a new technology that doesn't have early adopters who benefit massively. It might be the nature of innovation and new technology that there's an early adopter effect. 
* Bitcoin actually makes it easier for poor people to horde/hold/speculate (myself included). There's no minimum for exchanges and it's much easier to buy a fraction of bitcoin than say, a lump of gold or a share of stock. I think it theoretically allows a broader base of participation in the financial system. 
* This remains to be seen; bitcoin is in its early regulatory stages. 
* I think this is the most interesting argument, but I'm not sure I fully understand your point. My perception is that currently, capitalist-driven exploitation of human beings and the environment is close to an all-time high, with huge amounts of capital rapidly flowing around the world seeking to extract as much profit as possible. Why exactly do you think Bitcoin makes this worse? I think, if anything, Bitcoin helps to remove the hugely exploitative financial sector by offering better and cheaper financial services to both wealthy capitalists and poor individuals. There's also no reason Bitcoin can't co-exist with strong regulations on labor and the environment; why are these mutually exclusive?

As bitcoin runs into problems it never imagined new currencies will be invented that solve those problems.

I believe we are seeing the beginning stages of direct competition between the new wave of decentralized cryptocurrencies and established economic powers. Bitcoin is facing up to world government, established corporations, and global banks.
