Come to Ontario and enjoy the wait!

cept with the fact that BTC is pretty much outlawed by our banks, refugee problems run rampant and we are overly taxed in Ontario. Not considering the 9+ hr waits at local hospitals, Canada is pretty awesome.

Make sure to put a note on all your EMTs stating BTC purchase. Report back in a couple months.

Someone ran this on the weekend 
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:39:58
I run a full node and I simply run out of BW before month end and incur costs to continue running it. I have 500 gb available of BW usuage. Last month i had $40 in overage charges, thats tacked onto the $91 I currently pay towards the net. I generally have between 25-55 people connected.

The way in which he obtained my URLs was very simple. The guy submitted documents stating he was the rightful owner and that I was a developer and stole it from him. Godaddy released the domain. When I received the notification of pending domain transfer I called Godaddy to stop it, they stated it had to go up the chain of command and no one could help till monday. Within 4 hours the domain was moved to a new registrar and godaddy simply said SORRY, ITS GONE. 4 months of my life fighting for it back while this guy reworked the site / domain with a new blog, had pictures of my son and wife. In the end, we worked with NJ Parole Board, baited the guy, captured IPs, residence etc until they was arrested on Megans Law and some other items in the US (im a canuck). Currently Chris is still in jail. 
Good luck on on your battle. Ive been following the GAW debacle, they are a trainwreck.

If we start blacklisting coins then BTC is tainted and cash will again just be a better solution. I do not need governments and or police locking down any transactions because they feel like it. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:40:52
Bitcoin is right where we want it!

There is simply no reason to reinvent. There are countless of very successful websites / forums out there that run php based forums which are supported by communities of developers and paid staff.
100k a month is a whole lot of something. Simply buy your off the shelf license and 100k / year to a dedicated dev and create tools and applications that benefit the user base. 1.2m / year ...welll, what a waste. 
Outside of all that, speaking from experience I prefer vB and XenForo. Heck, you could simply hire devs on Odesk for $20 / hr and build some amazing one off unique tools for the users. 
edit: spelling

As someone who has owned 50+ forums, many of which were bigboards and consulted for one of the largest forum companies in the world, I think it is amazing that there is a alleged 100k being invested per month into this guys forum. I would love to hear more about what 100k / month gets you.

Godaddy released a domain of mine to a convicted sex offender who was hunting my son. It was a war. Took 4 months to get the domain back with little to nothing expressed by them other than Legal was handling it and tough luck. I moved to namecheap. F godaddy.

Tyson. The guy is legit. Good for him. I hope he has tons of success with this.

Honestly, the Skyhook is junk. I invested in both Lamas and Skyhook and while there is some functionality which is there for Skyhook which is not present for lama, the machines are at best entry level. Save your money, buy a used Trofa or Douro.  Support for Skyhook does not exist either. 
Best part is when BC goes offline, so does your machine. Its like the best of 2 worlds.
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:29:33
The only thing better than buying a skyhook is going through the hassles of selling it. Its not easy to convince someone that a piece of crap is actually something they may want. Good luck.

obviously that MUST be a lie..lol

bitcoin. disorganized and embarrassing at times. the future.
@_date: 2015-04-09 15:23:07
Sorry, I believe paying 300k a month in dev costs is a misuse.  My guess is he is just laundering the funds and living off of them. That garbage forum software he is using now could simply be dumped in favor of something with a good community and dev support behind it. 
Reinventing the wheel is pretty cool though, especially when you arent doing it.
Having people abide by rules / regulations and laws is not a dangerous precedent. BTC community cant have it both ways which is why BTC will continue to become more centralized and regulated. This is to attempt and stop the bad stuff from happening. Taking 'donations' when you legally cannot and then not using them is a scam and no different than what other thieves have been doing here. If you took donations, show us a ledger of how the money is being spent, the donators deserve that.
My suspicion is you will never know really how the money is being spent. The Josh Garza spin..... soon the new forum is coming, just let me spend my donations
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:51:37
Porn is highly regulated now and for good reason. BTC will be highly regulated and for good reason.
BTC / block chain etc really is only related to Theymos by way of user generated content, thats it. If the site disapears tomorrow, a new one will pop up, it should have little to no impact on the protocol itself. 
What theymos is doing / did is not cutting edge, we are not at the dawn of a new age for forum surfing. If theymos took peoples money under the guise of making the site better, hes a scammer. And if the 300k a month in dev work is to be believed, its crazy, outragious spending.
There will NEVER be a decentralized site, ever. The value is in your posts, your ips, your emails and your thoughts there. Decentralizing it will instantly kill its financial value. Should theymos care? No, he has bitcoins. 
What theymos should be doing is handing off the site to people who are capable and have what they believe is the best interest in mind for the BTC movement.
I suggest theymos can start by:
- wiping peoples IPs from registration and post tables. easy to create a plugin to do this and will align the most popular forum with the protocol itself.
-wipe peoples emails or create a system where those emails are salted and forward through a third party company. Rendering the emails to user name to IP proof gone.
- create tools users can use. 
Anyhow, in the end if he asked for money and people gifted it, fine. Its his to use as he wishes. If he took money to improve the site, improve it. The forum currently sucks to use.
Now in his defense, when he does try to improve it people will complain, but really, as it stands its really crappy.
Realistically, BTC will be regulated and controlled out the yin yang. As a holder who wants to see adoption, I believe this is the way it has to go.
@_date: 2015-04-09 01:08:13
Sorry, was more replying to the various comments about how 'donations' were never used when in fact they were donated to improve the site. 
Generally a company needs to be registered to receive donations. You can check if his company is, if so, you may be able to request a viewing of his books. I suspect the site / he is not and he may be liable to taxation by which ever agency (CRA / IRS etc).
I am of the opinion that if the donations were never used, or there is some sort of $300k / month in development to launder it, that is a mismanagement of funds. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 01:08:59
Dogecoin will never have any real traction compared to BTC. Hard enough to get people to buy in on the concept of crypto currency, let alone some coin with a cat on it.
@_date: 2015-04-20 18:23:51
Wasnt theymos making like 3k / month off all the BFL ads at the time?
Would have been nice if the guy coded in the ability for users to dump their PMs / IPs from the DB via their personal control panels. 
Maybe he should hire another 300k a month developer to do some good. :/
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:32:39
Removing Theymos is highly unlikely and I suspect he will never step down. Power.
Best way to impact someone who no longer may be the best for the community is to move on and start something different. ie: forums.
Find the top posters, team up with them and take a stab at it. Myself personally am willing to offer up for free vb4 / xF licenses to those willing to take a shot at it.
As for mismanaged donations. Check his state bylaws for what is required to receive donations. I suspect the IRS looks at it as an income.

I cant see how spending all of those bitcoins on rewriting forum software will do anything for anyone. Guy should be building tools and making his shitty forum more functional. Instead you have to wait a week to reply to someone because, well, 300k a month developer hasnt built a tool to handle spam bots or something.
@_date: 2015-04-04 18:16:27
I would rewrite some forum software. Pay devs 300k a week.
@_date: 2015-04-09 01:09:42
If theymos can receive donations, there is a chance we can all see his books. If that's the case lets look.

With Rogers cable, 500gig max data xfer before extra fees. My node gets about 35-70 users often, less since blocking the sybil attack ips. I try to run the node every day but sometimes I have to shut it down due to bw usage. Its down about 4 days out of the month.
@_date: 2015-03-20 18:16:15
Or you can hire someone from Odesk for about 1 btc or less and quality of work can be excellent.

Is there any sites using change tip yet?  I know with the availability of Advanced User Tagging (Lite) for vB4 it may be easier. 
I would love to see this available so forum owners can rewards users with post, or even adding Thumbs Up to auto generate a change tip of X value.
@_date: 2015-03-19 17:30:59
I contacted change tip about implementation for vB4 and XF. They did give some good feedback

Until the moderators / members realize that the site is neglected and there is no need for features to be removed, the outtages will continue. Speak of your discontent by spinning off a copy cat site or move to another.

I hate paypal now (14-15'), there was a time when I used it to bring in 100k a year on subscriptions etc. I never had my account hacked or froze, ever. But PP just sucks now.
The process to cancel was not smooth but this morning after reading the article I did cancel. It took 30 minutes. And when they asked why I said my sole interest is in Bitcoin and that I didnt like the politics surrounding PP dropping payments to Mega (which I dont even use). I am certain they gave 0 craps anyhow.
