Well the idea has a good way of dealing with this, I think. So have the separate wallets when the pool is just beginning. Some might want to buy bfl because you might get it sooner, or the majority might buy KnC. It's up to them, the option is there. And would you turn down a group of, lets say 10, people that all want to add to our mining pool, but they think KnC hasn't proved anything while BFL has so they want their money to go towards BFL, would you say no, our pool doesn't want your money?
It would completely allow the customer to decide. And then from there a vote of the shareholders could take place to decide where the money earned from mining goes for reinvestment, BFL, Avalon, or KnC. I don't see the downside to having a bigger, more inclusive group.

Hopefully he supported the bitcoin economy and bought some good pot from me, that way he could forget again and then find it when it's up to $1000...

As I said above:
Just an idea, but there's an opportunity for a great mining pool here. There have been threads about it on here and some people are really trying to create one.
If they could get a bunch of BFL customers on reddit to sell their chips for shares and get someone to put it together that'd be pretty awesome.
What do you think?

Do you mind pointing me towards some of those threads? I'd love to check it out. What has made you change your mind, specifically?
The chips is a part that I'm not that interested in. But why not start one big mining pool incorporating all different companies? What would the downside be? By splitting the wallet addresses into the different companies the people of the pool would choose what their preferred device would be, but there would be the safety of having the diversity of a number of mining rigs. Power in numbers as well. You have a larger overall amount of people that would be willing to invest. 
What do you think?

No, they would get their computers seized and have their business looked into. You couldn't hide the amount of btc they would mine. 
My point is this; you're thinking too short term. If they stay legitimate when the next round of asic technology comes out in lets say a year they'll make more, then another the next round and another the next round and more and more and more. So why would you ruin your business when everything is just beginning, if you believe people on here.
@_date: 2013-06-13 04:30:36
Yeah, but they were going to have them in like 2 weeks. It was safe to assume it wouldn't go up *that* much in 2 weeks. 
@_date: 2013-06-16 00:24:12
You're thinking short term. Difficulty is going to increase a ton here after they ship out the rest so we'll say by the end of the year. Now they made a lot of money but people would sue the shit out of them and they would lose a lot from lawsuits. They might go to jail, even. So there's that. But, also, after the difficulty goes up they get a new way to mine shit and they could make way more selling that plus the profits of before than just mining from this round of products. BTC could be around for a long time over which they could make way more money than one quick ponzi scheme.

No problem. And nobody ever knows. If you would have asked me three weeks ago I would have said the same thing and that everyone should stay away but it looks like they're getting their shit together. 
@_date: 2013-06-18 06:22:32
What??? no.... *whistle*
@_date: 2013-06-13 04:30:59
Yes, hundreds of 5ghs have been received. 
@_date: 2013-07-19 08:16:44
Already on there.

This is a pointless argument because nobody knows but to allow the disagreement to split one, big, successful mining group into two unsuccessful mining groups would be a really bad idea. 
So, here's what I propose. Get some of both. It'd be the safest way to go about it. Spread the risk. If BFL turns out to blow you have KnC, if KnC turn out to be a ripoff you have BFL. And some people are talking about avalon chips. There's no reason that the mining pool has to be a BFL mining pool or a KnC mining pool. Lets make it a reddit mining pool where we utilize ALL of our options. 
I also had one idea. Everybody is selling their BFL chips that the customer appreciation program put out for less than their cost. This would be a great opportunity for the reddit ppol if we could get someone to put them together. I really hope you guys can put this together.

Yeah, we are. People love us. We're normal people too :)

It's a joke. 
I'd say August is a safe bet. If production is going like they say it is maybe a few weeks, though. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 15:44:21
and I love you wesderf.

You're also not taking into account other altcoins. What about setting up a GPU miner to mine until the BTC difficulty gets to high and then jumping over to litecoin, converting it to btc as you get the LTC and then it's almost the same thing. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 15:13:00
So your solution is just to not mine? Well a lot of "clever" people have the same plan to all buy asics, so should I not do that? 
It's just a way to keep mining. I like the idea and this is a way to do it. If you have a solid gpu set up you can still get a semi decent hash rate on BTC and get a damn good hash rate on LTC. So right now I don't see why not. I could be wrong, you could be wrong, none of us know. And if LTC is too hard go to feathercoin, and trade that for BTC. There's still options with GPU miners.

No way!!!! For reals? Awesome!!! I'm going to go give you my money now. Can't wait.

I posted this to the OP as well. We should really try and get this to work and division won't do it.

If they go ponzi I'm suspecting it to be after all the 5ghs have shipped. Open up a second round/product on the small scale, maybe 7ghs, and then take preorders on that and bail.
But, The amount of money to be made from asic miners right now just make a ponzi semi-unlikely. If you can produce some the profit margin is so high you could make more by being legitimate than you could by ripping people off. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 15:54:37
yes he did.

About two weeks.
