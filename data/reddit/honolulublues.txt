I read about Bitcoin Days Destroyed... but is that number factored in?

Correct me if I'm wrong (and I very much could be). I'm a passive bitcoin owner and lurker, but don't these transactions include people just moving bitcoin around amongst their own wallets?

Captured a lot of my thoughts with that post. I'm no expert or crypto guy, and for me changetip definitely adds to the "cool factor" of bitcoin. Here is my first tip $1.

Nice that this exists, would be nice though to link an average joe pizza hut's site when they ask what the hell to do with the dollar that they just got changetipped.

something about having dominos protect my CC info is worrisome.

I'm planning on keeping it going for awhile. Seems like there is real interest.

Just wanted to comment saying that I bought my first Tuft &amp; Needle bed about two months ago and will never go back to a "traditional mattress". They are firm but have some give and I have never woken up with back pains because I "slept wrong". Can't wait to buy my next one (probably in like 10 years) with BTC!

Why would you buy at 900 when it looks like you may be able to get in at 600? My guess is that potential buyers are carefully waiting to find the bottom.
