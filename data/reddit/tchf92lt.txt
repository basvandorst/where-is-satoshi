I lost out on about 1 million... im living paycheck to paycheck and I don't talk about it when it's brought up. Kinda sucks but life goes on. Im hoping ether will  take off.

I've been interested in ether since the hardfork. The use applications are mostly hypothetical but the appeal came with bitcoin proving blockchain poc

I love it, but there are too many groups like this that nothing is unified and ultimately the general public doesn't get informed. It's probably because they dont give a shit about some digital currency that they have only heard about in the news as being used for silk road. 
I think the only real way that we could teach the general public about Bitcoin is by peaking their interest. I had an idea a while back about this and if people were to make flyers that had just the bitcoin logo, a qr code to a website like yours and a short intriguing title like "Join the movement" or "The future" (im sure someone could come up with something better) but if we could get people to just print them and post them to wherever millenials are (colleges, coffee shops, libraries,  etc.) we might be able to get more people involved. 
Id be happy to help get somthing started contact me if you want.

Regardless of your opinion, the fact that China is allowing bitcoin in their country shows that they don't have control and we know that they are afraid of it. I'm all for bitcoin, but your plain naive if you don't believe that China will be a force to recon with in the global financial arena.
