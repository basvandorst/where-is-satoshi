Here's my node. Ubuntu 14.04 Server running on an old MacBook Pro. Pushing an average of 500GB per month on a 200/200 fibre connection. The machine has been restarted recently to install updates, but it was holding around 150 connections as well as running a tor relay/bitcoin hidden service 'bridge' (bridging the TOR segment of the bitcoin network with the clearnet segment). Here's some pictures. 
BONUS: The budget WiFi bridge getting connection out to the node. 2x Ubiquiti nanobeam ACs, bridge mode.

I got started with Bitcoin at 16 as I was becoming interested in our economic situation and what could be done to improve it. Being pretty keen on technology I saw the concept, read the whitepaper and made an over the counter deposit to a local exchange (April 2013) to purchase my first ~0.4BTC for $50.
One thing I really like about Bitcoin is the fact that you can get into things like trading without having to deal with financial institutions and other middlemen. Getting set up is a lot less complicated that way. One of the perks of an open financial system. I didn't make a lot of money trading but it taught me heaps about how the markets work.
I mined occasionally in May using 2x7950 cards and guiminer on an AV machine at school when I was working on lighting design. It taught me about the proof-of-work system and helped me understand more of the underlying technology behind the network. I currently manage two X11 rigs (4x r9 280x cards per machine)
I don't think of holding as a priority and spend my coins where I can. If a shop doesn't take Bitcoin I ask. A local Café owner is interested in accepting them when there is cheaper protection from volatility available here in NZ (bitpay have a high minimum payout here)
Should you get involved? Definitely! Speaking from my experience being involved has helped me understand crypto and has given me a new hobby. Get some coins and enjoy the ride, this is only the beginning.
I know this has been a bit of a ramble, but I thought I'd share my experience, as someone else who got started as a teenager. Here's a 5 mBTC to have a play with. See you on the moon!
TL;DR: Go for it!

I'm tossing up posting a note on the Blockchain address with a small transaction explaining the situation. Worthwhile? Or just watch them.
@_date: 2014-06-09 05:24:57
This is for people who don't have their own ASICs and want to help spread hashing power. What makes you think GHash would give you benefits if they wanted to abuse power? I'm genuinely curious.

There's quite a bit more payout variance because of the low pool hashrate but you will notice the amount of payouts will average out to the same if not slightly higher than a conventional pool due to donations. Best way is to try it out for a week and see if you like it. 
What kind of hashrate are you running?
@_date: 2014-07-01 11:32:57
No transactions have been made by myself or the client. I called him to ask and he's confused and has no idea where they've gone having made no transactions.
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:48:21
In the first couple of days of mining he wanted to be able to check the balance from the rig. I advised against using the wallet for this and suggested he use Blockchain. The keys were removed after this when the rig was reimaged.
@_date: 2014-07-01 11:47:59
It was on his PC. It was turned off for several days before the transaction. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 04:09:41
Thanks for the tip! I'll make sure to [spend it wisely]( :)

100%. Guy who owns the address is in hospital and hasn't made any transactions. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 12:07:55
It really depends on how lucky the pool is, the amount of Bitcoin you're paying per terahash and how that lines up with profitability estimates.  I've managed to keep it pretty neutral by renting rigs that don't cost a lot more than the estimated return per TH. Pool luck being on your side helps too but that's down to chance. 
I'll get onto that picture tutorial tomorrow morning for you, so stay tuned :)

Not the ALS charity, but one of the people involved with bitcoin from the start is suffering from ALS and his wife as his full time carer could probably do with the donations. Hal Finney developed a lot of bitcoin's POW tech in the early days, was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction and wrote the elliptic curve system used to (propagate?) transactions more quickly. I'm on mobile at the moment but I'll update this post with his donation address on my break

Which would cause Bitcoin's value to tank

The guy who owns the addresses is in hospital and hasn't made any transactions. I've checked it out and change has always gone back to 1HE6 in the past.

The key was generated when he got his first rig, the day of the first transaction in the address. It was the wallet generated by multibit on startup. I tried to get round to his place to get his coins on paper wallets (offline generated, dice for entropy) a few weeks ago, but flooding prevented me from driving over his way. 
@_date: 2014-09-06 00:08:33
This is misleading. Many people use deterministic wallets like Armory, which generate new addresses for the change of each transaction. This also doesn't take into account the number of addresses used by exchanges and other companies who are moving coins around automatically for example.
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:04:09
Cheers for the mention!
I've been mining with an average of 1-2 TH on p2pool since I posted the tutorial 2 days ago. With today's lucky streak on p2pool I got a positive return of about 65% which I have put back into rig rental. I plan to keep putting more hashpower online with each payout and I encourage you guys to do the same :)
Mine on!

Thanks. I'll grab all the logs from the machine that had the key and look for any attempts to access it. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 21:52:55
* I found the transaction while taking a screenshot of the blockchain.info page to show the client, Showing him the difference between Blockchain and Multibit, which he was familiar with and Armory, where I planned to move his coins to cold wallets after he's out of hospital
* I haven't been able to get physical access to the machine, but he called his mother to check and she confirmed that the account balance read $11. 
* Windows 7, The wallet was generated on the 21st of February, the day of the first transaction
* The keys were on one of the mining rigs briefly which I had access to, but were securely when the rig was reimaged. 
* The wallet currently has 0.00470461 BTC remaining, leading me to assume that the transaction was generated by a human who rounded the total sent to 1.56 (as opposed to a bot)
* The wallet was shared to one mining rig but was removed ~2 days later at my request for security reasons. He used a USB drive, but I assume formatted it afterward.
I'll ask him to check the other addresses in the wallet when he's back at home with access to his PC. Thanks for the help.

You should be sweet as, they tend to find a few shares a day so your (per block) payouts should be reasonably stable. Give it a try for a week and see if it's your thing, have another node setup as a failover pool for backup though. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 08:00:33
Thanks for the clarification :)
 I'm looking for something I can run locally to relay transactions (Lack of nodes in NZ). I have a few bitcoind nodes on offshore VPS boxes I had lying around I aim to supplement the lack of blockchain storage on the RPi with those boxes.

On NiceHash it's mostly comprised of people who own ASICs pointing their hashing power at a 'pool' which automatically leases power to other people at whatever the current rate is. It works well for sellers because they don't need to be checking profitability all the time, the payouts go with the market. It's good for buyers because they can buy large amounts of hashrate at a slight premium on demand. 
Betarigs is similar but you are renting actual hardware instead of hashing power from multiple people. You rent a rig of a certain specification and select where you want it to mine. 
CEX.io gigahashes can only be pointed at ghash.io afaik, I've never seen them sold on Betarigs.

Thanks for answering, would you be able to clarify how I would use PP as a node?

The coins that were stolen belong to a friend, I keep the majority of mine in an armory wallet and on paper. I manage mining rigs for a friend who kept the stolen coins in a Multibit wallet. I was going to put them on paper (dice wallets, offline generated) 2 weeks ago but couldn't get on the road due to flooding. [see previous thread](
@_date: 2014-07-01 12:11:29
No cloud backup, computer is in a locked room. Only people in there could have been his parents. I've checked both mining rigs, neither of which had the keys on them.

Good one!
How's your mining been going? I've had just under a TH/s pointed there for a few days. I think I'll get ubuntu server 14.04 installed on a spare laptop and get my node back up in the morning (OSX wasn't cutting it)

I was actually pretty surprised with the amount of interest it got. I got a few teachers and students set up with wallets (Mycelium/blockchain) and sold them some coins. I also had several other people express interest in getting some from an exchange.
One of my brother's mates paid with BTC too.
