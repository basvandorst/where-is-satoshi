I'll have you know that I know how REAL COMMUNISM works. I mean, who wouldn't 50k a year guys SERIOUSLY! The rich people OWE it to us, after all it was handed to them so WHY NOT US! Actually, it's more of less compensation for us storming the streets to LIBERATE Berkley of the Nazi overlords! I literally lost Facebook friends on those streets and I don't even get thanked for my SERVICE. Hasn't anybody read Marx!! I mean they literally thought that freedom of speech extended to  the Jew Nazi Ben Sharpio on our OWN SOIL. Put your mothers' dish towls on boys/girls/queers/bi/trans/it and let's get to the streets to show these people that REAL COMMUNISM WORKS!!  
PS: I refuse to get a job until workers get their rights and will continue to be oppressed by the rich who refuse to pay me just because I don't work.

Yep, because communists, socialists, and fascists all eat their currency and use it to create clothing and homes. They ride their currency around as transportation while laughing at all the capitalists with their paper money with assumed value.

Their next comment really made me question, though I do believe they are in fact being serious.

Ohio state university is 5k a semester 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:52:09
Last I checked, average university students weren't getting masters degrees

He said average, like state schools not "liberal arts" disasters

If you don't mind me asking, how did you lose it all? Were you forced to sell at dirt prices to pay the bills?

What does eth lack that any other coin can compensate for?

To address some of your points, POS will initially be integrated to only 1 out of every 150 blocks so it's not like if it does not work the system will fail. Next, you say that developers are not using the ethereum blockchain just the same "base code".  If that is true, then where is the network to support the base code backed up with thousands of people mining to log transactions. Ethereum is just a developable blockchain solution exactly like you called for bitcoin to become. You do understand that for bitcoin to become even practical (not $11 transaction fees lol) there will be multiple forks to achieve the desired outcome. You shit on ether for having forks but atleast it's usable as a currency (more transactions than visa per second and $ .60 transaction fee)  
So tell me why there would be a need to create yet another developable blockchain with massive amounts of transactions/s and small fees when ethereum already satisfies. It seems like you have a solution looking for a problem.

I'm not an eth fanboy I'm just making discussion, don't be a bitch

10.5k /yr = 5.25k per semester. I simplified to 5k but it's closer to 5.5k after fees. I live off campus and if your home is within a certain distance from campus you don't have to stay in dorms freshman or sophomore yr. The cost is 5.25-5k per semester. This includes free access to city busses and a membership to one of the best fitness complexes in the world. 
Edit: forgot to add that it also includes access to a team of lawyers (student legal services)  I believe the fee is $30 or so and they will go to court for you as well as offer legal advice.

Just out of personal curiosity, do you have hundreds of those suckers piled up just waiting to be sold? I always imagine early investors as ppl who decided to throw a couple hundred dollars at some long shot technology when it was sub $1 and are just waiting to become millionaires lol

Unfortunately,  its not as easy as you might think. Getting a money transmitters license is provably the hardest part. Next would be getting bonded

Actually, yes I did. He posted it an hour before you commented. The time stamp you looked at was when he last edited it. Maybe you should read before you post.

With a market cap of 4.7 billion I'm guessing you would have to have a pretty substantial amount to alter the market. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 17:07:59
Time will tell..
@_date: 2014-10-16 02:41:04
How can they do that with the legit domain?
@_date: 2014-10-03 20:03:37
Your right! Because the market always repeats, just like history. And history starts with an H. You know what else starts with an H? Half! The BTC mining reward is due to half sometime this year. This year.. 2014! And the price will hit $480.. 2014/$480 ~ .23 ... 23, Lebron's rookie jersey number.. Lebron returned to the cavs this year!! You are one smart fucker..fucker..fucker...

Just a shitty troll

Definitely alot of jackasses commenting here. I am a fellow Trump supporter and I have been experimenting with and utilizing Bitcoin since the $10 mark in 2012 when I was a junior in highschool. I believe that Trumps ideals align with those of Bitcoin due to the fact that he is a proponent of free market economics.
On another note I'm sick to see what is going on around the country with the "tolerant left". Only a coward would assault a woman while wearing a mask then run, and it seems like the libs are doing it almost daily. Sue the shit out of Berkely. 
I don't have any questions but I just wanted to let you know that I respect what you are doing and appreciate fellow Patriots standing up to the bullshit. There's others like us and we have your back!

This is something I wish that more people who actually live under oppressive religious governments would speak up about. It's not right to rule unfairly in the name of an ancient prophet. I want Iranians and the rest of the world to have the same rights as US citizens without having to immigrate across the globe. As somebody who lives in that environment, what can be done?
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:56:47
Oh, you mean I don't understand a deflationary algorithm based on proof of work?  Please explain

I believe that. This dude is talking about having 3,000 bitcoin "leftover"  unless he's talking about silk road 1 he's lying lol

Just don't send that coin anywhere, otherwise you'll be left with 2 euro worth 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:44:38
It can as long as new money keeps flowing in, not saying it will. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:51:03
It's what creates value/incentive for the miners to confirm the p2p transactions and create a permanent universal ledger. Granted, it is quite wasteful energy wise 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:53:54
You are entitled to your opinion as am I. I've been in this game a long time and the bubble tale has been passed around for years. The real whales are in deep cold storage. You talk as if it's an all or nothing game. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:23:56
"Left over from darknet transactions "  right lol 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:00:27
Just because people buy into something hoping for profits does not mean that there is a bubble. You have to think, it's not like the entry level keeps going up and up. You can still throw 10 bucks at the technology meaning that anybody in the world can invest in the eco system. Think of it more along the lines of how much wealth are people  willing to keep in coins instead of fiat. As adopting and implementation increases, it makes perfect sense to keep money in crypto because you can still utilize it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:21:53
Bitcoin has no true value. You can't have a bubble on something with no actual value
