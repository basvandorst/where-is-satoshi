But won't they run into the same problems once they get to the size of Bitcoins?

I have a question unrelated to this thread. If other people charge a small fee to exchange bitcoin, why wouldn't everyone just use this bot? Or am I mistaken about something?

It's still there for me.

Does anyone know why it happens?
@_date: 2014-07-30 14:58:32
Because everyone else is doing it and I want to be cool.

If only there was some kind of cloud solution that allows you to scale with increases in traffic...
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:43:25
You don't need to.  I promise you there will be some event in the next 3 months where traffic spikes just as much as it did yesterday. They should plan for it.
