Bitcoin can never be a mainstream  currency due to how extremely volatile it is

So I’m assuming you didn’t read the governance structure of libra

It will never be generally used, it’s too volatile

Because Facebook and Zuck won’t own libra 
They’ll own Calibra a wallet

Bitcoin wouldn’t work. It’s extremely volatile and transactions take forever. 
Plus it doesn’t scale.
Libra isn’t owned and won’t be managed by Facebook.

Except merchants won’t, no firm will. 
For them to do so bitcoin needs to solve the following.
Bitcoins is extremely volatile.
It’s slow as fuck, relative to fiat 
Swaps to fiat take forever

Lol you actually think this?
Bitcoin will never replace fiat for four reasons.
1: it’s extremely volatile. For it to replace fiat it’s value must never change or if it does it’s an extremely small change. Of course it can change relative to other currencies changing in value.
2: it’s suuuuuper slow
3: it can’t be swapped for another currency in less than a second 
4: people who are utterly tech illiterate need to be able to easily use it.

Libra won’t yield profit for Facebook. It’s not owned by Facebook nor will it be managed by Facebook. Facebook is just one of many voting members.
