There was and is no public backlash about TR using any services, it wasn't an issue until paypal came out and banned him. Paypal is a business they don't need to get getting involved with politics, the only reason they've banned him is because its good PR for them, they wouldnt have lost any money by letting him keep using it. 
What other business should ban TR from using their services because of his views? His phone company? tv company, internet company? maybe his car insurance? or maybe his electricity supplier? 
I fucking hate scum like you, you support bitcoin so your obviously not a fan of corporations and big banks, yet when they make a move against someone who has different views than you, you cheer with delight, pull down your pants and stick your ass in the air ready to get rammed. 
It's all well and good until they ban someone you do like then its boycott boycott boycott. 
Why haven't they banned convicted child killers? or rapists? or Islamic terrorists? are Tommy Robinson views worse than Rape, Murder and terrorism? I don't agree with the guy to any degree nor do I know much about him but I also don't agree with huge, easy to use companies which are effectively monopolies banning people for their political views. Nothing but a PR stunt plain and simple, and you're being a good little boot licker and showing them how it works. 
absolutely pathetic.

stop stopping people from stopping people making predictions they can’t be sure about.
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:06:27


Yeah, as they should be, but I haven't seen paypal stop them or ones who have come out of prison from using their service. 
If you can show me some articles of that actually happening I'll happily change my view but I haven't seen anything.
My point is that it's a PR move against someone whos well known, they don't ban people like criminals and shit because they don't get any brownie points from the public for it. 
I dunno, for me personally normalizing companies banning from their service because of their political views leaves a bad taste in my mouth - yeah he might not have the best opinions but it sets a bad precedent.
Lets say power and mobile phone companies take the same route, you'll have thousands of people if not hundreds of thousands who can't get Electricity, water services mobile phone services, who cant buy and insure cars etc etc. 
I think not having a problem with that, purely because you don't agree with people is really fucked up.

I'm Irish and well I don't know a whole lot about him other than he was talking publicly about the "Asian" grooming gangs and that he's english what makes him a "grade-A bellend"

It's just too messy, best advice is to tell them to look into it on their own terms and make the decision themselves, your money your choice.

I wonder how many Verified facebook, twitter and youtube accounts have commited rape or murder?
Scare mongering BS.

So like Twitter except instead of Communists they have Nazis, well, I don't seem the problem I support Gab and so do thousands of others, pissing and moaning about it on reddit will do you no good :) 
buutt buut muh notziiis!!11

I would be very wary of getting too excited about a $700 increase in the price, given that we have seen BTC fall much more than that in a day.

What an angry man child.


I don't even use Gab, Gab was made in response to twitters Liberal use of their ban hammer, it just so happens that most people who are banned by left leaning silicon valley companies are right wingers.


Well, some people see Nazis everywhere, even their own pillows, so it doesn't surprise me that this sentiment is out there.

Gab is for Neo-Nazis, Russian hackers, pedophiles, Islamic terrorists, fraudsters, rapist murderers, drunk drivers and people who love guns. /s
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:47:51
Wait until you're down 84% and then cash out. a few minutes later when you see the price go back up by $400 it's a sign of an obvious bullrun, time to take out yet another loan and go all in.

I went through most of my short life so far not really knowing how shady those fuckers are, I bought BTC to make money but whole HODLING I have learned exactly how scummy they are, how they are even allowed to operate the way they do is beyond me.

You're not being downvoted for condemning nazis (virtue signal) you're being downvoted for terrible logic. 
Nazis use Gab therefore Gab = Nazis

But you already have free speech, I mean sure, Facebook, youtube and twitter, and google can remove your content and comments if they don't like them but hey they are private companies. 
You can always set up your own alternative, and sure Stripe and Paypal and mastercard can deny you service, but hey they are private companies.
You can always set up your own alternative, and sure international banks can sanction you, but hey they are private companies, you can always set up your own alternative. 
Plus its only Neo-Nazis getting banned who cares. 
Hey, its only Alt-Lite commentators being banned, who cares? 
Hey its only center right guys like sargon of akkkad being banned, who cares?

How inspiring and truthful do you think Nazi propaganda is that if left to their own devices they will suddenly turn the world Nazi?


Oh boohoo "I'm so persecuted for my beliefs poor me"
That's not whats happening here, you are deliberately mis-characterising things. 
Oh gee all im saying is racism is bad and im getting hate :'((( You're so brave fighting injustice on reddit. 
What you're ACTUALLY saying, is to deny people use of a service or to discontinue a service because its used by Nazis, as I already told you, thats what I have a problem with, there is nothing controversial about having the same opinion as the media, Corporate HR policies and 99% of reddit stop playing the victim. 
You're trying to make out that Gab is somehow a bad thing because there are a lot of far righters on it, but thats not the problem the problem is that Gab is needed in the first place - If these people are so wrong and backwards as you seem to think, then surely their ideas will be ridiculed and mocked on places like twitter, but no, you are so insecure in your beliefs you want big daddy government and mr.Friendly goodguy corporations to silence them for you, and to dictate what people can or cannot say, you want Gab done away with because people there are expressing views you don't agree with. 
How Ironic that you want to use authoritarian methods to silence people you think are so obviously stupid and wrong, but not so stupid and wrong that your confident the public will reject their views. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:38:15


I hate to break it to you but there are probably Nazis on reddit, there are definitely some living in your country, Nazis also buy fast food and watch netflix, there are even some on youtube.
Nazis use paypal, and amazon and ebay, they also drive cars, Some I imagine have cars and insurance on those cars and have a cell phone plan, they also pay for electricity and the internet. 
I'm failing to see how your point that Nazis use Gab is relevant in any way shape or form, or why it should discourage people from using it.
Should Nazis be banned from doing the things I've listed above?


Congratulations, you believe in all of the correct things and are a very good and nice person, why not screen cap this brave defense of your morals and post it to facebook for extra brownie points.
What about people who are flat earthers?
Islamic extremists who don't use violence?
9/11 Truthers? 
believers in Big foot?
those who are ok with people under the age of 18 having reassignment surgeries?
Trans-abled people?
UFO enthusiasts? 
Anti-Copy right advocates?
What opinions are ok to be spoken allowed according to you?

So should they be banned from owning pens and paper? or making flyers? holding public or private meetings? Because thats how they originally came to power. 


What about people advocating class warfare is that ok? Because it seems to me that theres a bit of a disconnect there in your logic. 
Encouraging violence against White/Hispanic/Asian people = Bad
Encouraging violence against poor/rich people = fine by you?

When you have no other argument other than pointing to how old a reddit account is, you know you're wrong.
Tell me, how old should a reddit account be before one can be sure its not a troll/Russian hacker?
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:29:25
When Nazis doesn't work, the next thing will be Russian hackers lol

So you are also happy with Gab enforcing theirs :) Good to see we have finally come to an agreement. 


Bitter aren't we.
lol I wonder how long until deletes absolutely shit for brained comments.
