How so?

Fair point. Midway in the second article is where I  start explaining the blockchain.   
In my opinion it's good to give a little bit of a backstory as to why things will change before you talk about the thing that is changing. Everything starts with a history.   
I recently finished reading a book called The Bitcoin Standard and the first 6 chapters where about everything but bitcoin. It wasn't till the end that all the pieces fell into place. I figured a few hundred words for an intro wouldn't be to much for most readers.

"Research good companies and try to look at it with a long term perspective. What market could they dominate, do they have a working product, who’s in their team, etc. " 
1. Not only talking about bitcoin but crypto's in general
2. Those people working on for example the lightning network must be wasting their time if it has already hit its peak
3. It's not even about a peak. Nobody knows where it is. What I do know is that it's about the intergration of a new disruptive technology which takes time. It took about 35 years for the global adoption of sending emails. So give it some time.
4. But if you do care about the peaks and bottoms: The amount of money invested into the total market cap of all crypto's at its peak was less than  1% of the total amount of money in circulation. 
Again....patience.

Very relatable! I guess it's just a big part of human nature, which is why some people will never get it.

Hahah! According to your future self bitcoin is going to reach 10 million and he slapped you? We should definitely listen to him!

Thank you for the kind words.   
You're not the first and I can guarantee you that you won't be the last that doesn't understand it. It took me a couple of years of on and off research before I finally understood why it was valuable. I'm trying to create a miniseries on my blog where I try to explain it as simple as I can possibly think of with examples you can easily understand.  The first post starts here: [  
I hope you get it a little bit better after reading it and if you have any feedback or questions feel free to comment below.

While writing that first comment I contemplated putting big companies that went downhill as well. I really appreciate you for being sceptical and pointing those out as well. The reason I only put companies that increased in value is because I'm optimistic about the future of the blockchain while hoping that they increase in value because they are valuable and useful. 
I can understand the confusion but it was really just a picture I found while cleaning up. It's just to point out that over these last couple of years those people were wrong. There's a possibility that they might be right in the future, but they were wrong in the past.

That's a very broad question and the simple answer is nothing. That's like going back to the first couple of years of Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon and asking the same question.
**One** of the ways I determine value is to see if there are people actively working on a project to improve it all the time. If the masses agree with the improvement than it's likely the asset will increase in price. (This is beside the point if the price even matters for bitcoin/altcoins since, for me, it's **also** about the technology and supporting the community)
I (and I can and will only speak for myself) base my future predictions on past performances. I deep dived into the technology and I assume that it will only get better over time because, as I type this, I know there are a lot of people actively working to make it better.
Hopefully that answered your question.

Hahah sounds about right!

So you're making a claim that its going down? If that's you're claim than I guess you have some sort of absolute-certainty-knowledge about the future.  
All I'm trying to get across is that we can't be absolutely certain about anything. What we do have to do and what we've always done is use a likelihood that something will or will not happen. Based on my understanding of the underlying technology, to me, it's likely that mass adoption will happen over time.
