A lot of my friends use Chase and they haven't had any problems
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:06:23
I would say a hardware wallet is the best way. More likely to take it serious and less likely to lose it
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:58:55
 No offense but that looks horrible (looks wise)
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:13:07
it certainly is important.

If not bitcoin, have her move the cash from chase to barclay. Their savings account is far superior
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:37:38
Yes. Don't wait. I waited when it was $200. Then when it was 800, same at 1200/2200/4000/6000/7000. Finally bit at 7800 and am very happy

Use square cash app instead . Instant buys, super simple
@_date: 2018-04-16 05:01:27
I'm still hodling Kanyecoin
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:30:08
I'd like to see more date ranges. April 1st to may 9th is strange.
How about last month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year?
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:31:29
Use the Cash APP. It's instant
@_date: 2018-12-13 02:54:01
I'm sorry this happened to you but this is anecdotal. There's three sides to every story as well. Yours, theres, and the truth. Additionally, I am involved with 100+ store fronts that all use Square Cash and have no problem . Clover is great as well but they don't offer btc as far as I know
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:34:27
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:36:09
Use Square Cash app on your iOS or Android device. easiest method. optionally you can also use the circle app
