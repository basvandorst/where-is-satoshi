That depends on whether you guess right or guess wrong. That is a bit like asking should i put money on black when i think the roulette will land on black and put money on red when i think it will land on red?

Gold doesn't really go up. What you can buy with gold is approximately the same as you could buy with it 100s of years. Or so I am led to believe.
So owning gold isn't really a way to increase you're wealth. But it's a great (the best ever found) insurance against losing your wealth. When you goes up, you really meant the dollar loses value consistently over long periods of time.
Bitcoin is a speculative asset, which could make you massive gains and become a millionaire and transform your wealth. But it is a highly speculative asset. Saying it is a store of wealth is like saying a dealer at a roulette table is a store of value whilst the roulette is spinning.
To me, saying Its a store of value is wrong. Although that is what it was designed to do, but it is certainly not acting as a store just now.
Also unfair to compare it to blockbuster. It is open source, evolving. And more like the internet of money. I say this even though I hate the term. The term makes it sound like it's the next big thing. Unfortunately I think bitcoin has no real value, unlike the internet.
To argue your last point. You  have silver and other precious metals. But you're right that they don't just decide to make a new precious metal every month. Competition of currencies is no bad thing (I'm unsure if forks or altcoins will actually impact the big picture of crypto currency, you'd need a better understanding of economics than me. It is inflation in a sense, but in a very unique sense.)

@_date: 2017-08-16 07:33:28
it depends why you are buying. I'm in the minority that really believes bitcoin is a bubble and some good points are made by peter schiff
but like he says, there is still the possibility of making money if you buy it at a lower price than you sell it. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:26:09
No but it incetivizes saving over spending in probably an even more damaging way. Bitcoin is deflationary. In a purely hypothetical world where everyone uses bitcoin then people would be much less likely to make businesses or innovate because there is a bigger risk and smaller reward.
@_date: 2017-08-17 07:29:46
well because it could also depreciate 100% next month. 
If everyone holds it, or enough people hold it, then it isn't currency and will never realize the potential you talk about. In that case, the people spending it now will make the massive profits. If it does realize the potential then it is the people who hold it who make the (even more) massive profit. 
Personally, i don't think it will reach the potential you talk about so my advice is to spend it, or more realistically sell it. Very easy for me to say that, having no bitcoins. It's you who hold them and it's you who needs to make the decision of which way it's going to go.
People probably won't like this analogy but you can make a limited analogy to gambling. If you put money in earlier you have made many times the investment and you can either pull it out now or wait and see if you can make many times more than what you currently hold. I say limited analogy because i did think it was a really great idea back in 2012 and i'd say it's not a very good idea in 2017 but a very large experiment like this is incredibly hard to predict. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:11:36
well that is obviously true. That bitcoins will be lost each and every year. 
Whether that means it will be Bitcoin's doom is another thing. Certainly having a currency that kept increasing (even if it was slightly) would, at the least be unprecedented. I think that is a reason why it wouldn't be used as a major currency. But that's just my opinion. 
obviously the counter argument is that the number of bitcoins lost would be very predictable every year 
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:52:11
if you are saying peter schiff is a gold shill then you must be a bitcoin shill right? If not, what's the difference? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:33:39
I always hear (but dont actually know) the mining is not profitable to do individually (to the vast majority of people). Have you looked at how much you've made from it?
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:26:16
it's a potential hazard possibly if the price dips. For example, when you have oil it often becomes unprofitable to extract it. Generally oil becomes harder and harder to extract but the price goes up and up so then it continues to be extracted. Even if it becomes unprofitable, it is still extracted if it is likely to be profitable again. If we use alternatives then obviously the demand for oil dries up and people stop paying to extract it.
I think people who are buying bitcoin at such high prices are generally thinking that it will go on forever (or at least akin to oil e.g. longer than our lifetimes). 
I'm a skeptic and as it's not really a currency nor a safe haven i think bitcoin now has a relatively short lifespan but it depends on what your thoughts are.
But i don't think it's a problem the average person can't mine it. We can't mine gold or oil, but that doesn't stop us from using it.
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:22:50
i don't own any bitcoins so it's fair to assume i think the best idea would be to sell them. Saying that, if you believe bitcoin has more potential (which is an entirely reasonable position to take) then your plan seems pretty good to me.
another piece of advice i'd give is if the value of the bitcoin continues growing in value consider increasing that sell order slightly as you go. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:32:05
just says that bitcoin could be money, not that it is. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:25:46
Well not yet anyway. I believe bitcoin is a fundamentally solid idea. But a lot of people owning them do not have much savings otherwise. When the next financial crisis occurs will be a big test. Do people see it as a safe haven to store wealth (although gold is the safer option) or do people start to sell off for security. Yes, the dollar might drop in value 10% as they turn up the printing machines but bitcoin could potentially collapse. If you have a lot of money in bitcoin then you may be willing to accept a decrease of value as long as you perceive it to be safe. Or sell it and get your money in gold. 
I love the idea of bitcoin but I'd be putting the majority of my savings in gold to be safe. I think bitcoin could still survive a collapse solely on how strong the concept is but it'd be of small comfort if you lost a fortune.

sure and Peter Schiff also invests in other things, a minority of his money into gold. Just like you shit on other digital currencies in your last few posts. Not everyone has to be invest in everything not to be a shill right? Nor would i say it's obsessive, he seems to talk about fiat currencies and gold/ precious metals and politics a lot more than he talks about bitcoin. 
nor is it nonsense, the arguments that bitcoin is not used as a currency are pretty intelligent. Sure, if bitcoin is one day used as a currency then the potential is massive and then the opinion is about how likely that is.

you're betting less than a penny. So it takes you many losses before you can begin making any kind of money at all. So in reality it is the exact same as doing the same bet on a roulette table except nowhere allows you to put a fraction of a penny on black.

to address your second point, i'd say i really don't know. I have read a lot of opinions like that, but i never underestimate people to come up with solutions or work arounds to technical problems. 
could a cryptocurrency be used as a currency? Probably i think. I'd agree with the statement that bitcoin does seem revolutionary. Is there one out there right now? I only really know about bitcoin tbh. And i think that bitcoin has fundamental flaws that mean it won't ever really be used as a currency. And will probably crash and burn at some point since the majority of people buying it are solely buying it to hold and make a lot of money. You only need to look at this subreddit to see people calling it a magic internet money train etc and being sincere about it. You see people thinking a bitcoin will be used as worldwide universal currency and a single bitcoin will be worth millions of dollars in their lifetimes. All that leads to people thinking 4k is worth, 8k is worth it, 20k is worth it. As they say, the best time to buy bitcoin was yesterday, the second best time to buy is now. All this leads to it being way over valued and being a big bubble ready to burst. But that's my opinion of course, we will wait and see. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:16:31
That sounds an entirely reasonable plan. Although i would add placing a stop less order at the price you bought it at is a relatively arbitrary number. Think of having what your asset is valued at today and then think of how much of that you would be comfortable losing in the hope of getting even more return. 
Excuse me for the gambling analogy but being in a casino after having won money and saying you will leave when you lose all of your gains is a reasonable plan but if there's significant money involved i think you owe it more serious consideration. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:15:27
obviously i don't know, but you probably have a larger % of your savings tied up in bitcoin than he does in gold. I don't really know his business, but it seems to be investment advice. 
There's nothing stopping Peter Schiff from investing a lot of money in bitcoin and becoming extremely wealthy if he did believe actually believe in it. 
Not to say that Peter Schiff is right because he's this flawless person, but what you are doing is what you were talking about what certain media does. Is where you make it personal rather than the arguments. He clearly doesn't believe that bitcoin is a sound investment. The points Schiff made were very reasonable points, especially that bitcoin is not used as a currency.

so that's 9 bitcoins over 3 months. Around $35,000 worth in today's value. 
If you look at the volatility over the last 3 months (and obviously it's possible to be even more volatile) then the average could work out at $1000 bitcoin value ($9,000) and say $10000 value ($90,000). No one is going to really agree to sell something for between $9,000 and $90,000. I say those values as extremes, but in reality it could be anything, just very likely to be within those extremes. 
You would be as likely to give someone x amount of scratchards and saying with this x amount of scratchards the most likely outcome is around $35,000 (but it could be anything). It'd only be accepted if that guy wanted to buy $35000 worth of scratchards which is pretty rare (i know that to win $35,000 on average you would need to spend more than $35,000 on average so not a great example, but the point is it's a big gamble).

Yes. But your 80% -90% is underestimating way too much. Also a large number of people who hold these bitcoin don't hold much else in terms of assets so when a financial crisis occurs there's going to be a lot of people trying to shift their bitcoin into a currency they can actually pay bills with.

other reasons why bitcoin isn't a currency but this isn't really one of them. 
Bitcoin is going up in value not because it's deflationary but because there is more competition to buy the bitcoins. Simple price and demand. And since more and more bitcoin are being created that is still an inflating currency. It only really becomes deflationary (which is still a massive problem) when all the bitcoins are mined due to some being lost over time. But that deflation would theoretically be very predictable. 


If that was the case, then she'd be equally crazy to buy with 80 quid as she could easily just buy 80 quid worth of bitcoin which could be worth 160, 240 or even 320 next year. It's like saying what's the point of going shopping today? I may as well take that money to the casino and who knows what i'll have tomorrow? Twice as much? Three times as much?

sure, same thing really. 
Of course someone is going to accept payment in something if they think the price of that thing is going to go up. If someone thinks the price of stamps is going to go up then they would probably accept payment in stamps. So the trade would go through if one person thought it was going to down and the other up as you said. However, that doesn't seem like a functioning currency to me. 
If you thought the dollar was going down, and you had to find sellers who thought the price of the dollar was going up then it'd make buying stuff pretty difficult. 
I think you're right about the uses. But then is the effort involved in setting up bitcoin and learning about it and how to use it worth the transaction costs of paypal? (and bitcoin can have significant transaction costs as well). So sometimes bitcoin has a use like that. 
And people are speculating on it. You see people on here saying things like "I feel like this is the bottom" or "i can't imagine it going below $3000" or "i think it'll go down to $2000 but up to $8500 by the start of the year". To me that's lunacy, what are any of these projections or feelings based on? The past price, that is all. Or some people think that it'll be the universal currency of the future, which is practically impossible if you ask me so if you believe that then any price of bitcoin below $10 million is a bargain (look at the person below). These tend to be the young folk and libertarians. Completely over valuing the currency.

I don't know the answer to that question. But I think not knowing just emphasises my point. Most people wouldn't even think to check. Because their main reason isn't to buy it as an investment. The main thing people compare a house with when considering to buy one is other houses. And they aren't really comparing the trend of house prices in areas. They're comparing how nice the houses are in their opinion.
But a lot (by far the majority) of the folk buying bitcoin are it buying it as investment. They are checking the returns compared to the stock market. If it were less, they would not purchase. The only people who would are the people who like the ideology behind it (I include myself there although I don't own any).
That is the difference. The majority of people buying a house are buying a place they want to live, and for security whilst the majority buying bitcoin are buying an investment to make more money.
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:11:54
That is not America. That is everywhere in the world. Generally the people who buy a house in their 20's are better off than people who don't so i think you could certainly make the argument it is the smart thing to do. What is not smart is borrowing the money and speculating with it.
You can view it as a 30 year loan sure. But if you didn't have that loan (a rate that is very predictable) then you are stuck paying rent that is not as predictable and over the course of your life end up paying more than buying a house in your 20's with noting to your name for the trouble of it.

you think Bitcoin is undervalued? I know this bank that went bust for billions of dollars. Just one bank. Let it sink in. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:48:49
not really. Most people buy a house because they feel the value of the house at the time is worth what they are paying at the moment. People don't tend to buy houses they think are over valued in the hope they will be worth more in 30 years. Obviously, most people do hope the value of the house is worth more in 30 years but most people do not buy it as an investment. They buy it as security that they will own the place they live in when they retire and do not need to worry about affording shelter in their old age. 
If someone invests a mortgage in a house they want then they will always own something that is vital for their life and a house they liked. If someone invests a mortgage on bitcoin they don't really have anything if that bitcoin loses it's value.
