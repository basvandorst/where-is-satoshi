That's logical and I agree it's most likely what happened
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:06:09
This is what it spit out 
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:33:01
But all of the withdraws are so similar, I find that hard to believe someone spent them randomly 
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:05:17
Okay this is what is spit out
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:18:18
Bitcoin core
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:54:38
I was mining. I set up the wallet once, kept it offline, and mined with a pool that deposited to that wallet. And no I never checked it as I said, it was set and forget
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:56:49
good point
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:09:58
1BwNnfCCrCN3dWDhjC2dDYYQfoMEiyKmP4.   That is my wallet
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:44:22
I have a record of the creation of the wallet
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:58:21
My point exactly 
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:48:16
So how else can we prove that?
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:33:37
But I could be totally wrong
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:45:15
and I have the original backup of the wallet 
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:56:07
Thats what I am looking for
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:35:57
There has to be something, you have all these other stories of hiring people to track this stuff down
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:11:48
The VM where the wallet was created was shut down and deleted and the wallet was stopped in off line storage. Could the into vm have been compromised? Possible, idk. Could the wallet backup of been comprised during transit, idk either, maybe
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:13:59
I setup a bunch of miners years ago, and went to into a set it and forget it mode.  I want to just set it all up, let the miners run until they died and then come back years later to a bunch of coins, except when I  came back, all of the coins where stolen out of the wallet. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 02:13:49
it doesnt seem to be, nor ones in the chain I can find
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:04:56
As sure as I can be, yes
@_date: 2017-09-06 02:13:23
I would say there is a bunch of information now
@_date: 2017-09-08 03:56:40
Sadly there has been no path forward
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:51:34
But I have the private key for that wallet
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:27:35
Yeah, and thats why I thought it was programmatic, but I never had the wallet online, it was offline the entire time. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:23:18
That seems unrelated to this doesn't it?
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:12:57
It was not encrypted, and I know the issues with that. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:11:52
That is the wallet it was stolen from and show when everything was stolen. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:34:12
Yes I see that now, okay I have Bitcoin core up, I will see how to do this
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:19:47
Why would it happen over time at a specific rate, seems odd
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:32:44
I find it odd that all of a sudden someone would be watching this thread and would react, without years of activity, seems more like a program, that watched the wallet and after a deposit removes a random amount

@_date: 2017-09-06 01:56:20
Someone to track it down that is
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:06:31
But the account is still being skimmed as per the recent test
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:36:47
 
So sad
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:05:48
I believe a good portion of context is now present 
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:55:14
the wallet was created in a vm then shut down until now
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:24:13
The miners I had setup were part of this pool, which is of course gone now  
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:13:53
Yeah I didn't know about that either, it's actually a very simple thing to do
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:43:39
For those still following, check this again.  A test was made to see if skimming is still happening  
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:33:27
Oh sorry, read that incorrectly, so yes I have Bitcoin core up, I will look at it to see how to sign a message for proof
