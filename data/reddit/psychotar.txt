Exactly. Basically all I did was raise my cost basis :(

I only had a BTC loss. I still made dollar gains.

Ehhh I thought I was gonna be clever and have my cake and eat it too once. I tried to sell out on the downward swing, and while I did miss the bottom, I also waited too long to pull the trigger on the way back up. After the full cycle of trades I ended up with 0.06 BTC less than I started with and a tax bill for capital gains for my trouble.

Then I would assume you know what liquidated means right? They either closed it themselves or it was auto-liquidated because it was on margin. So yeah. He already got rekt.

Bitcoin has a market cap above $250B. This type of manipulation is no more likely than it is for a company like Wal-Mart of GE and maybe even less so since the bitcoin market trades something like $8B dollars a day and regularly has 20-30% swings anyway. The amount of money you would have to commit to actually move the price of bitcoin and get it to stay there while ALSO having an offsetting short position (even when leveraged) is beyond the scope of all but the very largest institutions in the world. Then you have to take into account that the crypto market doesn’t behave like any other rational market in existence and there is no way for anyone to really predict exactly what would happen if they tried to pull this off. The level of risk would be astronomical and the institutions with enough firepower to pull it off are not the kind of gamblers to try something like that.
Over time a futures market could ultimately have an affect on the price of BTC and crypto in general by influencing market sentiment and bringing in more traditional investors, but the likelihood of anyone coming in and hoodwinking a half trillion dollar market is pretty slim.

That by trying to time the market I ended up worse off than if I had just held through it.

Bitcoin is treated like an investment by the IRS (not a currency) income from bitcoin follows the same rules as stock gains. When you buy the price that you pay is your cast basis. You will not owe any taxes for holding an asset but selling it does trigger a “taxable event”. Once you sell the difference between you cost basis and your sales price is your taxable income. Assuming it is positive it will be subject to capital gains tax.  If you held your position for less than 12 months it is considered a short term capital gain and is taxed like normal income at whatever your marginal rate is. If you held it for more than 12 months then it is a long term capital gain, which has its own set of brackets similar to income tax (0%, 15%, and 20%). I cant tell you what your rate would be without knowing your filling status and AGI, but long term capital gains tax is essentially always lower than income tax rate.

I sold a third of my XRP at $0.77 for BCH after the Coinbase announcement. It was the only coin I had on an exchange with BCH, and I thought it was going to pop so I didn’t want to wait for a wire or a transfer.  Talk about a double plus ungood.

That’s not 100% accurate. You are also liable for capital gains if you spend bitcoin as well (the IRS classifies crytocurrencies as an asset not a currency). So if you spend them on something you need to subtract your cost basis for the value of your purchase and then the difference is a capital gain.

Mt Gox (the largest bitcoin exchange at the time) disappeared in the middle of the night. BTC crashed like 90%.
