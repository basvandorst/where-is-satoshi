Surprised this wasn’t in the OP - the mainnet tweet linked says ‘soon’ though.

I don't think the point of dogecoin is to hoard and to hope it appreciates in value.
It's for tipping and spending and having fun with

Fair point

Screenshot it, then get a QR app that'll work from saved photos?

You could say the same about electronic fiat, which also works on a ledger (a centralised one, owned by your bank). You don’t ‘own’ it, it’s all virtual anyway. you have credentials to go and access it. (And yes you can withdraw in physical form but that’s not relevant here)
Crypto trading in the eyes of the IRS will be the same as if you were trading foreign currency, electronically: capital gains when you exchange between cryptos.
If you don’t like it, find a different country that has more favourable tax laws

Companies don’t ‘exist’. They are a social construct for human cooperation with records of incorporation held somewhere (usually, Delaware). Stocks don’t ‘exist’ either. They are a notional thing recorded in a ledger on some computer.
I don’t see how an electronic ledger of stocks or any other notional asset is that different from crypto

The equivalent thing here would be selling some AMZN for NFLX. That’s a taxable event

You don’t own the blockchain. You own a digital asset enabled by one

Christ no, don’t advise this. What if bitcoin tanks for another year or two, or some other crypto gets massive real-world adoption (not just speculation) and overtakes it?
If your parents are older, they should be more risk-averse. Could they afford to lose it?

Googling him may also shed more light.
His fringe party, UKIP, are quite widely supported among the xenophobic daily-mail-reading lower and middle classes here.
I'll be getting downvotes because I'm insulting the guy and his followers in this subreddit as part of my argument, and I'm not sourcing anything, which is fair. The man is still a twat. hates fiat and the euro, so any criticism of the video here or Mr Farage himself gets downvoted.

Erlang, Go, Clojure, etc etc
Combined with a good non blocking http server like nginx, you can start to scale quite high on modest hardware

I know it was, and I expected the downvotes here.
The guy is generally and widely ridiculed, he uses his MEP (member of european parliament) status as a soapbox for his anti-EU vitriol and he's basically trolling for tabloid soundbytes. No publicity is bad publicity, and his self-imposed mission is to make a mockery of the very thing he's a part of, without being constructive.
I'm probably preaching to the wrong crowd here, is fairly libertarian and are against large government and likely the EU as a concept.

Everything priced in BTC online instead of USD? *Really*?
Bitcoin is a nice experiment, and may even work a niche currency when the volatility goes down, but it's way too fiddly / techie for joe public

The guy is a crackpot FYI

It is up to you as a developer how you code your classes. You don't *have* to write code that is hard to gc and / or maintains a lot of state.
If your jvm is doing stop-the-world-gc all the time then you've either set your max heap size too low for your problem, or you're storing too much state and the incremental/concurrent-mark-and-sweep can't maintain your heap at a reasonable level.

Yeah I get why my argument wasn't good, but couldn't bring myself to spend the time to properly research and source an argument to post it here. Thanks anyway
