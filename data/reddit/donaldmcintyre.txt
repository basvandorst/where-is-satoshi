From that perspective it may be a case similar to "immutability" where  the term makes sense because of the extremely low probability of change, so it could be generalized as immutable, even if that is impossible.
However, I think the term "trust minimized" is more accurate because blockchains depend on a reduced group of miners so, although the internal protocol provides for a statistically insignificant risk, the social layer (mining business owners, developers,thought leaders, etc.) is subject to a much larger risk.

I think there is a bubble, but not because of it's nominal value as to historic prices. My impression is that with interest rates at 0%, investors have flocked to variable income assets like stocks, startups, and real estate (again). They have also bid up high risk debt like junk bonds.
Fed policy has exacerbated "[moral hazard]( and distorted  risk perception by investors IMHO.

Yes, it responded to sun and moon cycles and marked summer solstice, this is confirmed with the actual position with respect to the time of the year, etc.
Without denying these facts I see that the effort to move stones hundreds if miles and to locate them in central places may also respond to economic incentives. People could spend and even risk their lives in this endeavor.
Like the Yapese did with stones and public consensus to create a monetary system, and the Christians, Muslims, Jews and others with their temples in terms of storage, trade, money exchange, and lending centers, I think that the Stonehenge boulders and rocks (and many other Neolithic stone places and menhirs in Ireland and Europe) may have been used as money centers also.
The stones had to be huge and heavy so "hackers" couldn't steal them or at least it should take an extraordinary amount of "power" to do so, and they were all in the same place so there could be "consensus" in the form of a common oral history of the transactions.
So I think they are religious, related to the sun and  moon, they marked a place for trade, and they were the money too!

Of course the public needs to be alerted about material security or insolvency issues at a deposit service, but this is not the case, Peter Todd says above "This particular issue isn't really a big deal...". So it seems it is a biased action he took, rather than a contribution.
A whistle blower can do it for noble reasons or to affect the reputation of someone. The conflict of interest is still the overriding issue IMHO.
@_date: 2014-12-21 21:43:05
The issue of Peter Todd's conflict of interest is the overriding real problem here. 
Having a core dev and advisor to competitors openly accuse one of the main BTC services of being insecure, knowledgeable, not trustworthy, and even calling the previous lead dev as no good, is very troubling.
personal interests and comments are secondary to what Peter did in terms of Coinbase reputation combined with his own conflicts of interest.
A private email or call to Coinbase would have sufficed, but for him it seems to give him much more utility to denounce them publicly.

In the future the mining cartel that controls the blockchain will sell "protection" to the community by charging ever higher fees (a la Western Union) to just keep the blockchain up and running.

I am sure many people have at least thought of the stones as some tally or counting system and then they said "what a silly idea", especially because it was so much effort to cut, move and install the stones.
But now that we have the blockchain and how Satoshi instituted such a "heavy" load for attackers to hack the blockchain it makes sense that in the physical ancient world such a system could be instituted with very heavy boulders.
Also, the consensus mechanism of everybody meeting once a year to make sure the history of ownership is only one, just like the Yap.
I hope somebody checks the specifics!

A tip of $0.08 (like I see below someone tipped someone else) means that to make a median US annual income of $54,000 you need 675,000 tips. This is a huge amount of traffic and tips that very few people will be able to achieve. Only extremely popular and charismatic influencers.
I think micropayments should be used for "metered services" rather than tipping (unless tips are higher).
@_date: 2014-10-26 19:47:56
Yes, they are side chains because they are connected to the Bitcoin block chain as a "parent chain". 
For example you can park 1 BTC on the BTC block chain and connect it to the side chain and issue an asset on that other chain, but only if the first BTC is blocked for those purposes. It can be converted back to Bitcoin also.
Its like a convertibility in traditional central banking models where a currency of one nation is pegged to reserves in another currency of another nation.
Alt-chains like Ethereum or Namecoin, etc., are independent and are not subject or pegged to any Bitcoin so they try to "steal" liquidity from Bitcoin by creating the need for new miners, users, developers, etc.
@_date: 2014-12-14 07:45:42
When I read about the analogy of Rai stones in Yap and the Bitcoin blockchain that was a starting point, then I went directly to look for theories about Stonehenge as money and I saw the theories ranged from spiritual to aliens, but no monetary theories. 
I searched more and watching a documentary I learned  about the builders, the method, the location of the original stones (more than 200 miles way) and I connected the dots:
Money - incentives - need for consensus in a central place - heavy blocks for security - meetings on summer solstices - oral history of ownership - contract signing with religious strength.
Of course it helped nobody knows what was the Stonehenge for anyway!

Peter, you have an explicit conflict of interest as a BTC core dev and as a paid advisor to Coinkite (and you say above you are entitled to stock).
To openly criticize Coinbase in this forum and Twitter and even mention above that you wouldn't trust them with your Bitcoin as if they were so insecure is troublesome.
Wallet hosting services are very sensitive to public perceptions of security, here you are saying you don't even trust them and they don't know about Bitcoin and they shouldn't do what they are doing and that Gavin is no good.

Thank you Peter, this is all a very interesting issue because I have never experienced such a truly globalized (meaning non-silicon valley centered) tech project like Bitcoin that is truly decentralized as a service with no central authority or owner. 
This is interesting because apps and private services are being built on top in different jurisdictions and there is no regulation or public system that enforces a rule of law in it.
It seems the only balancing power is "the community" so it is an experiment also in free speech and self determination.

I am glad about this because every time I defended legality I only got bashed by many members (here, on CoinDesk, and Cryptocoinnews)
My observation, now corrected by these comments, is that SOME Bitcoiners were very adamant defending Silk Road and Ross Ulbricht with the principle that any private person must be free to buy drugs, thus Ulbricht was perfectly justified in creating a market for that, that he was not actually dealing, and people in general should have the right to consume or produce and sell any drugs.

I think that when you view the blockchain as a network system for untrusted parties to connect without the need for reputation or previous knowledge, it seems a contradiction that a organization would want to build another network for the same purposes, but controlled and restricted by the corporation.
It's like saying the "white horse is black".
On the other hand the whole idea of consensus blockchains is to have all participants have a say in the network by building and hashing blocks openly and federating the computing power to protect the database collectively.
But there are some industries that are semi-open and could benefit by semi-private blockchains.
For example a central processor for international banking could be replaced by an interbank blockchain with a special banking currency.
Also, in order to have state control of the currency, nations could develop national blockchains where the central banks control and regulate the protocol and the private banks mine and keep the ledger.
If you see the blockchain in its separate parts (peer-to-peer process, consensus process, the distributed database, public-private key system, the underlying asset, etc.) there could be some isolated applications that private or semi-private organizations could use IMO.

Bitcoin is the base money, if it is used in a fractional reserve operation is up to the customers and the service provider and is unrelated to the underlying ledger IMO.
Mt. Gox was operating like this and we have no way of confirming Bitstamp, Kraken, BTC China, or Coinbase do the same.
When a service hosts your BTC they can start a fractional reserve and use your BTC. It's a private agreement external to the blockchain I think.
Fractional reserve is not flawed, that I am sure.
Fractional or not that is a business decision and an evaluation of risk/return.

I think the above pain points are mainly troublesome if the general objective is to position BTC as a mass market payments system. I think this approach is wrong or at least early.
I think the best killer app is investment and speculation and the whole ecosystem should be formatted to inform and promote BTC as an investment asset rather than as a currency.
The above strategy would bring more liquidity, make information flow better and provide the basis for other applications like payments, smart contracts, etc. for the future.

CoinX and other startups, if the banking issue was the culprit, really lost millions in value because of the opportunity cost for not being able to open and manage bank accounts here.
I think the government must have had a lot to do also, not directly, but being ambivalent and making the banks feel insecure about Bitcoin.

The only thing the Bitstamp move to AWS shows is that there is a general tendency in blockchain networks to concentrate computing power, very much like oligopolies in traditional economies, into the hands of those who can afford such data-centers.
It happens because it is costly to run a mining operation and because it is costly to keep security at high levels (the latter being the case of Bitstamp).
EDIT: bellow is right, this Bitstamp move has nothing to do with "general tendency in blockchain networks to concentrate computing power" it's up to Bitstamp to manage their own databases with private key information and where to host and not related in any way to the blockchain technology since it is done off-chain.

IMHO common sense is not always the norm in financial markets, in my experience human biases and irrationality sometimes become the norm (Warren Buffett lives of that!).
The community needs to understand that Bitcoin is the product of deep human behavior study, economics, and computer science is only the tool  to implement it.
In Bitcoin or any human organization (families, clans, communities, nations, etc.) you need 3 layers to keep it stable:
1. The base is security: a space that is secured by nature (e.g. rivers, oceans, mountains, etc.), force (police, military, etc.) or, in the case of Bitcoin, a protocol.
2.  Property, titles, and agreements (or contracts): with a base of security then property is secure and thus becomes valuable, titles are valid and transferable, and agreements may be reliable thus creating certainty.
3. Productive activity (economy, manufacturing, finance, free markets, etc.)
A fork (if AVC means by that a non-consensus new version of Bitcoin a la Bitcoin XT) that prioritizes 3. productive activity e.g. scalability for the sake of scalability, but that undermines 1. security, will be a fork that would prove that Bitcoin, as an experiment, has failed.
True rational behavior would be to preserve security in the network as the prime goal and to solve the scalability problem in a consensuated (non-fork) gradual, conservative way.
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:06:26
I agree with you, Bitstamp runs a full reserve (or now maybe fractional after the hack) system off-blockchain, but the link I make is that to protect their hot wallet they decided to move to AWS. The hot wallet security issue is related to how Bitcoin works in my opinion (at least when it comes to the public-private key management).
Mining is different issue, but I mention it because it is too a high cost enterprise now and more and more only big players can participate, but it is a separate issue to the Bitstamp thing.

This doesn't mean anything for Bitcoin (or Coinbase).
Law firms dedicated to pursue stock market and finance class action suits have been doing that forever. For securities firms it's a daily chore to deal with these lawyers who sometimes have something, but many times it's just hot air.
If Coinbase explicitly stated that they were licensed in NY and California that is bad and they may end up coughing up some cash just to settle (sometimes reputation is more practical than the truth), but this is just the beginning, because the life of a financial institution is about dealing with these cases.
Wall Street firms have annual budgets designated to this and actually end up charging their clients for these lawsuits in the form of higher fees and commissions.
Just business as usual.
EDIT: The lawsuit should be dismissed, this is Coinbase laguage:


It is clear they didn'tlie, IMHO.

I agree with the concept that drug use, production, and supply should be free because it doesn't make sense that alcohol is free, but not drugs. But in a context where it was clearly illegal it was not justified to start and run Silk Road.
I am sure in the trial it is going to be debated the fact the the marketplace is NOT the drug dealer itself, but in general it is considered an enabler and part of the scheme (very much like money laundering).
I believe in civil disobedience and revolutions if justified, in this case I don't think there was justification.

I felt rather silly at that time in this video asking and re-asking about their licensing, what was the process, and what I could trade with them as a regular user. I was so impressed by their progress compared to the rest!

Since I discovered Bitcoin and realized what a world changing technology it was I have observed that total decentralization was not possible since I saw two groups that could gain power with time and potentially become market dominant industries imposing their terms: miners and core developers.
I saw before how unjustifiably publicly [bashed]( for some other security issue at Coinbase, and now I see do the same with Circle.
I think both Coinbase and Circle are examples of responsible, well managed, high quality VC backed startups, that includes security, and I think public shaming is not the way core dev's should approach this at this point.

I share Erik's u/evoorhees concern, I think Core has been mismanaging communication which is key for the social layer of Bitcoin (development and secure miner/node consensus).
Additionally, I think 3 out of 5 Core devs being co-founders/employees in one $80mm Bitcoin infrastructure company is a breach of security in the network.
It's great for private enterprise and volunteers to support devs, but the team must respond to a diversity of patrons IMO.

About the mismatch between TX flow and block discovery:


I think the above mismatch implies then that 1MG blocks cannot be counted as 100% fixed capacity. There should be a margin of safety relative to the variation of blocks per hour standard deviation.
E.g. if sometimes there are 8 blocks per hour discovered if  miners are "lucky" and then only 4 are discovered when miners are "unlucky" then there is an average of 6 and a normal deviation of 2.
2 / 6 = 33% therefore a margin of safety of 33% should be considered as a "real" block size.
If the current block size is 1MG then in reality the network can count on a real 1MG - 33% = 0.66MG block.
This would mean that the current usage of block capacity is not 30-40% full as stated in the post, **it's 45-61% full.**

Agreed. Nevertheless, the "social consensus protocol" that will emerge will be a critical part of the future of Bitcoin's security.

This is not a "provider - customer" situation where the product must be adjusted to customer preferences with no regard whatsoever to design.
The "product" in Bitcoin is security, users are not technically savvy to understand that yet.
If users only want scale just for the sake of scale by destroying the basic value of Bitcoin then they will realize that that was a bad decision, but it will be too late.
The Core debate about scaling is not a conversation with customers, it's an internal debate (which is part of Bitcoin's security design) of how to provide scale while preserving the highest standards of security.
In any case customers would want (if they had the technical skill to understand it) scale and security.
If users were circumventing Bitcoin it wouldn't be worth ~$6 billion and trading volumes wouldn't be increasing.

The CTO of R3 writes:


Satoshi meant for Bitcoin to be more than electronic cash, the above phrase was written by him because that was just the first, simple and direct application he foresaw at the time of that writing.
In an [email to Wei Dai]( Nakamoto also wrote (before publishing the final version of the paper):


The above shows that the vision was bigger than what Gendal observes and his narrow comparison to cash:


In abstraction, what Nakamoto created is a secure space for people to store and transfer ownership. This is because for the other higher level applications (digital cash,  smart contracts, smart property, escrow, etc.) the base Bitcoin network (a distributed ledger with accounts and transferable balances) was necessary first.
As the first network and because Satoshi, like any other human, can't predict and pre-design everything to perfection, Bitcoin served as the first vision of electronic cash, but he didn't design correctly the programmability part so that network, by itself, has little chance to support the other applications he envisioned. 
The above is why sidechains and Ehereum exist. Maybe Bitcoin itself could be evolved and redesigned to support programmability, but it seems very risky at this point considering that its asset BTC is worth $6 billion.
The above is why I think Bitcoin should be a global high value transfer of wealth system, but not a Visa competitor.
Because the innovation of Bitcoin is not cash (that was invented thousands of years ago) but the secure space for storage and transfer of ownership (which happens to be useful as cash as well), is why the **comparisons between "permissionless" vs "permissioned" networks is false**. That dichotomy does not exist. The only option for real security is decentralized networks without trusted parties.
By the way, the elimination of the trusted third party is just a security condition necessary to the secure network, but not an end in itself.

Your "account" with Circle is not a traditional "account number" type like in banks or other institutions.
In the case of Bitcoin cloud services like Circle, Bitreserve, or Coinbase you are identified by your email or user id, but unlimited Bitcoin addresses may be assigned to your profile. The sum of all balances of these addresses are your final balance in BTC.
There is a theory in Bitcoin that addresses should be used only to receive and send only once and then change because of security issues since your private key may be compromised or recalculated as you send from a BTC address.
This is the explanation on [Bitcoin Wiki](

Ideally everybody should be equally subject to the rule of law, and that is correct.

Nick provides key principles and direction to the ecosystem IMHO. 
This is my summary:
1. Apply computer science to minimize the need for trust between strangers.
2. Strict enforcement of property and contracts by protocol eliminating enforcement by violence like FBI, cops, army, etc.
3. When a system creates trusted 3rd parties (stranger) to manage it they become security holes (hackers, identity, privacy, etc.)
4. In a world with mass markets and billions of participants trust minimized protocols to enable interaction between strangers are the best solution rather than central trusted entities.
5. The philosophy is trust minimization to reduce risk, cost and make systems global (cross borders)
6. Bitcoin protocol is the solution, but is basic, Ethereum is the solution to smart contracts.
7. Bitcoin best applications are for global payments and as a reserve currency.

Thx for your response.
Because I am not a computer scientist I can't comment about how VB uses the term "Trust" in that context, but I understand, as an observer, that trust is eliminated completely in Bitcoin so there can be permission-less full participation in the network and all members may interact with all members because everybody is bound by the rules of the protocol. This eliminates the need for reputation or trust and thus reduces cost of transacting to near zero levels (marginal cost of TXs).
But I would understand people building other protocols that use what they call subjectivity (as opposed to the objectivity of Bitcoin) to achieve desired levels of security while eliminating some inefficiencies like mining and the time needed to confirm TXs (+- 10 minutes in Bitcoin).
On the issue of presenting opinions as facts i don't agree VB does that, but also I think it is the same with Bitcoin when the last 6 years of its history are presented as definitive proof that it is a success.
I think Bitcoin is in the experimental stage, with the 2009 white paper being the hypotheses, and finding that its utility I not that obvious and wide in its current form, especially with its memory and scripting language limitations. It is not even possible to implement smart contracts and property on that blockchain.
I think Sidechains will solve a lot of those problem, but isn't that a cloud of farts just like Ethereum?
Ethereum not even in its experimentation stage, its a hypotheses yet to be even tested I agree,but I don't think the people in that project are presenting it as proven technology.
I think the people that gave them the 31,000 BTC are aware of the risks and the pre-experimental state of Ethereum, the ICO was transparent and everybody informed about its real risks.
If there were some investors that bought Ether impulsively I don't think that is Ethereum's responsibility.
I support the proliferation of alt-blockchains because Bitcoin didn't deliver in the smart contract/property "promise", in fact the alt's exist because of those deficiencies, and I think that natural selection and the struggle for survival will determine which protocols will be used massively for finance, IoT, EoT, etc.

The same way Bitcoin is not good or bad because of cases of fraud or corruption, the banking system is not good or bad because of cases of fraud or corruption.
The banking system was the best monetary solution for 500 years because the blockchain didn't exist.
Let's try to stick to Satoshi's issues he was trying to solve:
- High cost because of trust needed.
- Delays because of old centralized systems.
The bad reputation is because of lack of information and adoption, these convictions actually help to solve the reputational problem IMO.
@_date: 2015-02-05 03:07:33
I mean that Bitcoin has a bad reputation because of an image that it is a tool for the object of enabling drug trafficking, money laundering, and other illegal activities.
I think that this high profile case may give the general public the impression that Bitcoin is not the problem, but bad guys who break the law, like in any other case involving dollars, bitcoin, or any other form of payment. 
As Bitcoin separates its image as a means for illegal activities I think more main stream users will feel comfortable using it and that is good for adoption.

I used the term "brute force" because it is the term I learned when taking the cryptography course, it means just going through all the possibilities in the search space just by using computing power to speed it up: The more computing power the faster the calculations, thus, the faster you can break the encryption or decrypt.
