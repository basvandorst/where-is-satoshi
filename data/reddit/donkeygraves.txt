You guys are fucking awesome! Please tip your driver!
@_date: 2014-06-18 21:00:58
How so? I appreciate your thoughtful criticism, care to expand on the topic?
@_date: 2014-01-08 07:36:26
Sorry, I didn't list a story because it wasn't quite done. I hit up a bitcoin friend of mine on skype that happened to be around and got it to him. 
It's last call here int town in 30 minutes so I picked the path of least resistance. All is well that ends well. I'll report back when I have a couple ciders in my stomach and am maudlin about the wonders of cryptocurrency. 
I love you all.
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:55:24
I would send you 0.04 first and 0.02 after you give me proof of purchase. Would that work for you?
@_date: 2014-01-08 07:01:18
I'll bump it up. I'll send 0.04 and then 0.03 after confirmation of purchase.

He does and you should pay attention. Taxes are real and math is a huge part of it. If you wanna fight that, that's fine, but it is very unlikely you'll ever avoid it. 
This site's idea isn't funny or clever. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 05:55:41
I was not rude at all, I know the gals that run the place. I've spent a lot of money with them and encouraged them with their new website to add bitpay. They are awesome! No bullying involved.
@_date: 2014-10-21 19:31:51
You can! I pay my power bill with them and they have systems for paying taxes as well. Jack over at SnapCard has helped me pay even odd bills with weird web forms. They have amazing support!
@_date: 2014-07-26 23:15:01
I didn't make it. Sorry you had a bad experience. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 01:15:38
I assume accidental clicks, assholes, or people who don't like beer or cigarettes but haven't figured out a good way to hate gas stations.
@_date: 2014-07-26 00:46:59
Currently they aren't set up for tipping via bitcoin. Please tip your driver in cash. They are some great gals running a small business and they need your support! If you're local, buy something from them!
@_date: 2014-01-08 07:45:27
I blasted you some change for being cool. Thanks for your help!
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:47:30
Yes. I don't have my wallet. I'd pay you in BTC for you to make the order because I don't have my goddamned cards.
@_date: 2014-07-26 05:56:34
They are opening a a second store south of the river soon. If you wanna spend some BTC call them and tell them!
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:48:38
The owners know me. This is not an abnormal order for my address. They can confirm if you call them that it's not a kid trying to score some smokes. I don't know a kid that would want to drink a dry english cider or pay $10 for spirits anyway.

This subreddit is a whacky mix. Sometimes it's juvenile and stupid and other times it's thoughtful and informative. I have a suspicion that the more vitriolic the post, the less likely that person is to own any bitcoin.
I kind of like the multiple personalities though. It's definitely not a normalized boring repost fest. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 22:59:12
To be fair the article did kind of read like alarmist BS. Thanks for posting a better link to the facts.
@_date: 2014-05-01 20:31:17
I have never had a browser extension, even useful ones, not be a poorly programmed resource hog.
This sounds like some bad planning on the part of the developer. I would not trust this product.
@_date: 2014-01-14 01:54:23
To be clear, I'm of age and was carded by both the vendor and the guys at SnapCard.
@_date: 2014-01-08 07:17:34
I got this resolved y'all. Bitcoin is amazing. Fuck banks.
@_date: 2014-01-08 07:33:44
I am genuinely sorry for using another bitcoiner friend to get it done... I've only got 20 minutes till last call and I picked a horse. 
I did however get your address and I'll send you some coin just for your time. Thanks mate. I appreciate your willingness to do a thing. On top of the BTC, if you need a favor that you think a stranger could help with. Please hit me up. I will do my best to comply.
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:28:48
It's a terrible joke.
Minors can't be in bars.
@_date: 2014-05-01 14:30:45
Why is this a chrome extension? The browser seems like a horrible place to put something you're trying to keep secure.
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:28:34
I didn't.
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:02:19
You just put an invoice with the address you'd like the money sent to. They'll get BTC from your coinbase account or you can pay an invoice to a BTC address. Then they put cash in your google wallet.
Their online support chat is around most of the time if you have specific questions.
@_date: 2014-11-18 02:45:14
Can I see more pics of the setup, please?
@_date: 2014-11-18 00:01:04
Aren't most laser setups shielded? What about your eyes? The paint can make this look sketchy but the work product is really nice.
Are you a wizard?
@_date: 2014-07-26 05:43:05
Heh. I think I'm their best customer in general. I'm sort of a shut in. I was their first BTC purchase!
@_date: 2014-01-10 09:39:40
I was willing to take the risk. On the plus side, the person who I got to buy it mentioned Bitcoin to the owners and they want me to talk to them about accepting BTC in general. It all turned out good. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:13:22
This right here. I know it's popular to bash Gox. Doom saying is easy. It'll suck for a lot of people if they are insolvent. There isn't any concrete evidence that they are insolvent and this issue did not only effect their exchange. 
I have money on GOX. It'll suck if it's gone, but that's my deal. I just don't know why people have to be so vicious when nothing is proven yet. I mean personal attacks on this man about his weight and appearance. 
I really feel like the middle school level of discourse doesn't do anyone any good. If Gox isn't insolvent and they get their shit together, the people spraying the vitriol will never apologize and if they are in fact screwed the countless posts calling people who got fucked idiots and calling the people who have worked on this exchange all sorts of names will never see an end.
Call a spade a spade maybe, but wait for the flop. 
EDIT: To be clear, I do plan on moving my BTC away if I get the chance. I'm happy with the press releases and disclosure they've done. I don't think it's appropriate to attack people on a personal level for a business issue before the details have been made available.
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:17:24
They had never used the two websites I ordered from. The second had trouble with their "bookmarklet" but they walked me through it and got the order done. I think they'll do their best anywhere. I don't know why Europe would be any different. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 03:00:26
Give it to me, I'll burn it for you. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 21:02:18
Why not? What does the size of the box have to do with it?
@_date: 2014-07-26 17:39:18
There wen't any really, it was just timing. They were redoing their website and I was like "remember how I told you I want to pay you in bitcoin?" So they asked their web devs and they added bitpay. I'd ordered from them a handful of times with Snapcard too so that started the conversation like eight months ago.
@_date: 2014-09-22 18:15:16
[kinda like this](
@_date: 2014-01-10 09:37:09
Who gives a shit. I had a weird request. I sent you some cash for indulging me. You're a nice guy. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:37:47
With tip I can do .06. Maybe half up front half on confirmation of purchase?
