Hasn't every coin that has even been lost technically destroyed as well? I personally lost like .5 btc like 6 years ago. I'm sure many others have as well.

Well, if you understand the reference, you'll know he isn't throwing a molotov in the original.  [The character is from a piece of famous Banski street art, where the message is basically "wage peace".](
But yes, out of context.

I've seen the documentary and I've seen this particular piece posted online numerous times.
Banski is pretty well know, I don't know about the reach of this particular piece. 
I do agree that it's a reference that people probably won't get.

Yeah, and lets say that 1000 glass marbles are worth the same as 0.00153 gold marbles.  Do think somebody that knows nothing about marbles would rather play around with 1000 glass marbles, or 0.00153 gold marbles?  I mean they're worth the same amount right?  Shouldn't make a difference, right?
Someone that knows nothing about crypto currencies and is just looking to mess around with some currency doesn't care what the value is.  They just want to play around with it and learn how it works.


I don't really follow you here.  I'm being neither anti-intellectual or insecure.  But please, feel free to disregard my point and just hurl insults.  I don't care, I'm going to the moon.

Absloutely.  If the BitCoin community is going to be this stuffy about DogeCoin, then DogeCoin is going to quickly become the face of crypto currencies IMO.  Someone just starting out on crypto currencies would probably much rather play around with 1000 DOGE than 0.00153 BTC.
I mean really, the BitCoin tips I've seen on this thread are being tipped in USD.  I don't even think you can do that with the doge tip bot.  1 DOGE = 1 DOGE, and right now that is all that the DogeCoin community cares about.

Not to mention the currency soft caps at 100 billion, with an additional 5 billion a year after that. So it would take like what, 180 years after the 100 billionth coin to even have 1 trillion  coins in existence. That is also assuming no coins are ever lost.
Also, you can use commas for large numbers to make them easier to read. You can only really use scientific notation for small numbers, and its not as intuitive.

I've received a mooncoin tip on so I guess they still work at least.  I hadn't heard of mooncoin until I received that tip.  I accepted it, but I don't intend to download the wallet.  If mooncoin becomes relevant to me I'll re-tip them sometime.

Dogecoin isn't trying to battle Bitcoin, it's going to the moon.  It isn't trying to be a serious endeavor, it's trying to be a fun lighthearted way to tip people and buy things on the internet.  Dogecoin isn't trying to be an investment, it's trying to be a currency.

Again, you entirely miss the point.  I'm not talking about investing, or buying and trading, I'm talking about taking someone who has never heard of crypto currencies and getting them interested enough to download a wallet and play around with it.
And just so you're aware, I've taken zero risk with DOGE.  Every DOGE I have I mined myself with my computer while I'm away from home.  I'm not looking to invest.  I'm looking to play around with it, tip it, have fun, and maybe one day be able to buy donuts with it.
Insisting people be serious and embrace fractions isn't going to work as well with the general public as simply giving them 1000 DOGE and telling them to go to the moon.
And before you tell me to go die again or tell me I shouldn't be handling money, I'll let you know that I have nothing against BitCoin which you seem so insistent on defending.  All I'm saying is that if I was gonna teach my Grandma how crypto currency worked, I'd rather give her $1 of DOGE than $1 of BTC.
At least that way when she has questions and finds her way to a subreddit god forbid, she won't be told to go die.

Wow really?  :-/  I've long been a supporter of Bitcoin, but I never really got into it because I never understood how it worked, and at the time I didn't have the hardware to mine them effectively.  I was mining bitcoin back when it was $5 a bitcoin. I mined on and off for a week and I got to about half a bitcoin which was nothing at the time.  Eventually I forgot about it and formatted my hard drive losing the .5 BTC.
That being said, DogeCoin made it really easy to get into.  I mined for 45 minutes off a 50kh/s laptop and had 400 coins to play around with.  After that I was hooked, and I now have about 28k DOGE.  I've been able to send myself coins and mess around with stuff and now I fully understand how crypto currencies work.
The fact that is being super bitchy about DogeCoin is really childish.  It benefits all crypto currencies to bring new people into the fold and teach them how it works.
@_date: 2014-02-04 07:19:55
Just so you're aware.  That fact that people like you hate it so much is exactly the reason so many people like it.  DogeCoin takes something super duper serious like money and makes it very friendly and lighthearted.  If I could practically do all of my transactions in my everyday life in DogeCoin, I would.  Someday...
@_date: 2014-02-05 06:54:09


Money can't be serious, cold, or indifferent, those are human expressions, and money is not a person.  You are seriously personifying money to try and make a point.  Money doesn't do anything.  People like you are cold, serious, and indifferent towards others about money.  Not everybody is like you.
Some people are friendly, helpful, and generous towards others with money.  Ya know, like the good people over at &gt;money isn't something that you want to play around with
Why do you think kids get an allowance?  It's not so they can invest in stocks or start an IRA.  It's so they can play around with a small amount of money and learn how it works and what it can do for them.
 Anyone starting out in crypto should get a small amount of coins, and learn how to work a wallet, how to add addresses, how to send and receive payments, and how to encrypt and back up their wallet.  After they know what they're doing, then they can start being serious and invest some real capital.


We're not talking about me buddy, so stop confusing the issue.  We're talking about your average person.  Right now there isn't a single fiat currency out there that deals in fractions larger than hundredths for purchases.  If you're expecting people to take the transition from dealing in hundredths of a unit to billionths of a unit in stride, you've got another thing coming.  
Doing everything in satoshis would be a great solution, but as long as the wallet is tracking things in BTC, you're going to confuse people.  There would honestly have to be a change making the satoshi the only unit of measure.  It'd make big transactions harder, but if it ever gets used as a currency, there would be far more small transactions than large transactions anyway.


Hunh?  What lies am I spreading?  People don't like dealing with tiny fractions.  That is a fact.  Just because people don't like tiny fractions doesn't mean they shouldn't be allowed to use money, and the fact that you seem to think so is mind boggling.  
People like you are the reason that DOGE is going to succeed.  You drive people interested in learning about crypto currencies away from BTC to DOGE where they're welcomed with open arms.  So keep up the good work I guess.

Not everyone is vulnerable. There are just lots of people who have poor money management skills and refuse to live within their means.

I've just been buying .1 coins every month for almost a year now. That got a lot more expensive recently, but I'm going to keep doing it until my Bitcoin and my IRA are the same value, then I'll put the same amount of USD into both each month and see which does better by the time I retire. Sould be interesting.

I knew about Bitcoin back when it was like $5 a coin, but I was living with my parents, and didn't have a computer to mine coins.  I kinda forgot about it for a long time, and eventually it because a bigger deal, but I still didn't really understand how it worked, and how the wallets worked.  It wasn't until Dogecoin came along, that I was able to mine some coins and mess around with them and learn how the wallets worked.  After buying a few hundred dollars of Dogecoin just for messing around with, donating, tipping, and making novelty purchases, I finally decided to buy some Bitcoin.  I think I started with 2 Bitcoin, which at the time was $700.  This was pretty recently.  Immediately after I bought that, the price crashed down to below $250, so I bought 4 more.  :-P
So, to answer the question, from when I first heard about it until I bought my first coins.  Probably 5 years?

Think of it like you're running full speed, like as fast as you can, and you jump down a big flight of stairs. Can you land it? Maybe. Is it much easier to roll out of it. Yes.

It's not about any single issue.  It's about people on Reddit not doing any of their own research and not thinking for themselves.
Don't let other people do your thinking for you.  Form your own opinions.
