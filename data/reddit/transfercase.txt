I know Russia had invested in a mining compound fed by solar power. Don't forget wind power though.  [ 
The caveat to solar is that the best places in the world for it with the most consistent sunlight are equatorial (read HOT) and cooling becomes an issue. Wind may be more transformative for the industry as you can get excellent wind power production in cool climates.

All this says to me is that it is becoming more efficient to mine bitcoin, likely due to ASICs. 
Another factor would be the migration of mining centers to cheaper and cheaper locations. 
Also, countries/energy producers are realizing that their excess electricity generation can be sold to mining companies instead of being offloaded at a loss in order to protect their grids. That means deeper discounts on electricity contracts for miners to consume a set amount of energy for X number of years. This also means power producers can go full production knowing they have a contractually obligated end user for their electricity, increasing competition and driving discounts deeper: if you have the infrastructure built already, you're going to try to use it at the rate most efficient for producing energy, even if that means selling electricity for peanuts to prolong your equipment life. 
Electricity contracts may also explain why it took the hash rate so long to fall after the price peaked. Miners were forced to continue operations at a loss until contracts ended.
Interesting little article with some power production economics explained in a real world example:

Since nobody took the time to actually explain why they're being dicks, I'll try to explain why your comment is unrelated:
The upper bounds of bitcoin is a set number, 21M, and cannot be changed.  
If a person owns 1 bitcoin, they own 1/21M, equivalent to 100M sats 
If bitcoin is broken down to smaller units and the standard becomes milliSat, or whatever you want, you're adding 0s to that persons balance but their share of the limit does not change. They still own 1/21M Bitcoin or 100M sats or 100B millisats.

Yeah, he was extrapolating it to the top 5 cryptos using the volume-weighted market cap.. a creative approach. Bitcoin wasn't Pareto dominant, but close. 
I think the main takeaway is that we need to consider factor sparsity when we look at market dominance.
I could make a shitcoin with a trillion units, all pre-mined, and then sell one to myself for $1 and shoot to the top of the chart because liquidity and volume aren't considered. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 15:42:39
It is still interesting though that more miners will be coming online. That in itself is quite a positive sign.

Good question.. I was reading recently about  ECDSA P-256 security and how long it would be before a computer could tackle that. Qubit (quantum computer calculation unit of measure) growth projections suggested commercial quantum computers could have the capabilities in as little as 5 years. If that somehow becomes mainstream and a shift to quantum mining occurs (truthfully I know very little about quantum computers or their applications), we'll see a leap instead of a flattening, though more widespread commercialization would likely have to happen first.

EVERYTHING experiences bad press. Cell phones. Amazon. Even the internet was criticized, and yet here we are. The big thing is that you ask questions, do your own research and come to your own conclusion. The fact that you're here posting likely means that you have some belief in bitcoin. Don't let the news tell you what to believe.

Listed prices are limit orders from other peers on the exchange. If you make a market order, you're buying at the lowest listed limit order in the order book, and buying it at 'market price'. If you set a limit buy order, you're then listed with everyone in the order book in numerical order, and your order could become filled if someone does a market sell order that is large enough to fill all orders higher than your order as well as your order

Well look at the price of True USD and you'll see where some of those tether holders have gone. I think that someone unwilling to hold Bitcoin or others will not suddenly decide to HODL just because the tether has come undone. They'll only be in bitcoin briefly before transferring and selling back to cash on a fiat exchange or buying a different USD-pegged coin. I'd love for this to set off the bull run. Something as stupid as removing the Korean exchanges from CMC caused the start of the bear market, so I suppose anything IS possible
@_date: 2018-10-15 18:20:56
Do we know the details of how the transactions will come back to the blockchain? I'm afraid that it'll end up being another exchange where everything is done in the back end (or side chain?) and the trade volume of bitcoin is subdued due to the fact that few transactions are actually made on the main chain. I can only assume that Bakkt will be out there shouting their volume from the rooftops to prove their success, but without that volume translating properly to bitcoin charts and resources, it'll still appear that nobody is using BTC for purchasing. It would be nice to convince a few people that crypto is used for things other than being a criminal

@_date: 2018-10-16 15:34:07
I suppose there's some truth in that, but once people start seeing an increase in purchasing using BTC, the actual value carried by the coin starts to increase; the more purchases made, the greater the intrinsic value. At that point, the average person on the street will start to believe in it. If it becomes accepted by merchants but there are no (visible) transactions occurring, that belief won't come to fruition

There are other budgetary/accounting ways around it, but it would certainly become more difficult. That's my greatest hope for crypto and bitcoin, to provide real accountability and transparency in corporations and government 
Edit: if the government needed to bail businesses out, they might have to work harder to reclaim ill-gotten gains from the perpetrators of the incident to fund the bailouts, which would be a big win for the little guys
@_date: 2018-11-10 17:19:11
From an accounting standpoint, wouldn't it make sense to depreciate your stuff as quickly as possible? That would essentially give you more cash-in-hand after tax filing, which could be dumped right back into more equipment (to be depreciated again that tax year and protect profits again).
The faster you get moving in the mining world, the greater the rewards, especially from a speculative standpoint assuming mass adoption of bitcoin (you aren't starting a mining company if you don't speculate this to be the case, imo). If tax law allows you to depreciate the crap out of your equipment and claim a loss, the revenue generated by the extra cash-in-hand will likely outperform the tax sheltering lost in later years by a spread out depreciation model
Of course, I'm not accountant and don't know the rules surrounding depreciation of mining equipment, but if I found a loophole to depreciate all of it early on, I think I would

@_date: 2019-01-25 19:10:49
Disagree for two reasons:
1 - you're referencing back to 1500s, while BTC will be fully mined in 130 years. Yeah, it can be seen as inflationary in that time period, but you're obviously thinking bigger than that
2 - during the growth/development phase, people are likely losing BTC faster than it's being mined. The supply shrinks constantly as coins are sent to obscurity and these can't be accurately accounted for. I've seen mention of reclaiming lost coins, but how can it be proven that they don't belong to someone else who has no interest in moving them? I don't see a scenario where this could happen... 
Bonus point 3 - it's such a difficult market to quantify that nobody could ever account for that inflation anyway when it's still up for grabs whether the asset will act as a currency, store of value, contract settlement tool, etc. 
At a fundamentals level, sure, it's maybe inflationary, but in reality, I can't agree

@_date: 2019-01-25 21:01:37
Yeah, there are certainly plenty of ways that you can do it, but when it's potentially someone's fortune that they've put away for a rainy day, it seems unethical. I don't see many people jumping into a coin knowing that this is a condition in its protocol. I know I wouldn't. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 18:53:57
I think there's more of an implication that as bitcoin expands it would have to result in a system where you borrow it to make large purchases like you currently do with fiat. 
The point he is ignoring is that when all of those people lost their homes with subprime mortgages, the bankers and everyone on wall street involved were bailed out or received no recompense for their actions, thus widening the poverty gap. The fed printed money to cover the whole fiasco and the US debt levels increased, thus causing consumers to further foot the bill as their money became less valuable.
The question is, why would this stop if BTC is used? Well.. there's a visible money trail which is helpful and will be scrutinized by the public to hold parties accountable. When regulators step in, I think corporations and government will need to make themselves highly visible on chain for accountability, while private citizens should not be required to do so. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 16:16:13
Okay, but why wouldn't this be a scenario:
In a market phase like the last few days with little volume and sideways trading, you accumulate as much as possible. Everyone is on the sidelines waiting for price movement. You buy futures to short the price, then unleash all of the accumulated coins at once to break down the resistance you're sitting at ($3500) and create a spiral to the next resistance where you take profit on your short futures
Edit: this isn't a strategy for the average trader, obviously. This is the yahoo chatroom of wall street d-bags coordinating massive manipulation

But that's because they spent profits to grow the business to avoid taxation. If they just reaped profit without doing such, they'd lose revenues to taxation and would not be growing their value and share price. Many companies could show much more green on the books if it made sense to do so, but taxes may as well be the devil

I think his argument is more that the market price is partially determined by traders who tend to use those traditional metrics. So if they're using them, regardless of whether the market has a different timeline, that's what they'll be seeing and reacting to, and the market will continue to respond to those signals as any traditional market would.
