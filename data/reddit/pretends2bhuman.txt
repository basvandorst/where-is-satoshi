Much different? How so?

They haven't realized yet that their party has been co-opted by a bigger party. The libertarian circlejerk just turns me off of bitcoin.

Actually no they are not, If you really think about it. Unlike a business, democratic and republican governments are not operated for a profit. 
Most politicians are Lawyers which do a fair share of professional speaking, yes.

Hi, I'm Adolf, I accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-13 14:37:43
That is a rather narrow view for someone whom purports admiration of open-mindedness. Also, politicians need to know how to govern and lead, not necessarily be great business people. The government is not a business and bushiness's are not people. 
To base ones judgment and support solely on weather or not a candidate accepts bitcoin is quite silly and immature.

Direct trade for resources/services would be the main currency in this scenario.

Coinbase accepts savings accounts. Just have your parents help you open a savings account. Tell them that you want to learn banking and one day save enough to buy them a new house. They will think thats sweet. In 10 years when you come through on that promise you will make them poop themselves.

The porn industry have always been early adopters of technology. I would say its a matter of time.

I am one too but please don't tell them. 
Seriously though, the btc turns me on (a lot) though the politic, not so much. I wish this movement was more apolitical.

The industry that my company is in is not the most tech savvy due to the typically older clientele. The industry is changing though and a newer demographic is starting to get interested in it. My hope is to be the first to offer this as an option in effort to educate and support the alternative currency movement.  I agree that it probably wouldn't have a significant effect on our bottom line but it should help open a dialog. Plus people like options so it's win-win. 
You hit the nail on the head on my motivation to use a service like Coinbase. The only way I will be able to convince my partners is if I can assure them that we will have some safeguards against that volatility. Thanks for your thoughts.

You just said something right there and even though I already knew the info, I didn't exactly realize each 1 BTC inherent rarity until just now. It finally hit me. Thanks.

I was serious about that one and I agree. It would be a nice homage.  Not the second one so much. Haha. I was just getting goofy.
I'm going to bcoin a new phrase so get prepared.

Coinbase is based in San Francisco isn't it?

I just received a call from a woman whom sounded about my mothers age. She went on and on about how proud she was that she remembered the number. I stopped her to ask who she was and whom she was looking for. It was a wrong number.  She was a nice enough old gal, and told her it wasn't a problem. As I write this she has called twice more, bless her heart. She is so apologetic and sweet.  Its been a hundred and thirty some years people still seem to have issues using the technology. 
Btc at its easiest method of entry still seems to have a high barrier of entry. It should only get easier with enough resourses and time.  
Technology is taking less and less time in becoming umbiquitous. If successful, mothers will be using btc with the same regard to securtity that they currently do with credit cards within 15 years. 
My questions:
If we should ever reach singularity, will we even need a currency?  Would we choose to use btc for more than a simple extange of property ownership when physical ownership is meaningless? Will knowledge continue to be power?
@_date: 2013-05-10 03:06:13
Haha. Ah they aren't so bad man. They just need to quit circle jerking long enough to realize that BTC is bigger and more important than their somewhat extremist ideology. Look, call me pinko, a bleeding heart liberal or socialist. It's all good with me as long as their team and my team are striving for the same goals. Hell, bring the far right and those damn fence sitters to the party too and lets all get bloody rich together.  I will however continue to support my social philosophy and programs with my profits though taxation, volunteerism and donation.
Because fuck banks.

Brilliant! 
Three Questions
1) Can I work for you? Seriously, I ooze experience and professionalism.
2) May I telecommute? I would be willing to take monthly flights to attend meetings.
3) Can I get a portion of my salary in btc?
