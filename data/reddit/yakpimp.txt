But I was told it was going to the moon. 😊

That's pretty harsh. I'm not trying to sell you litecoin. It's one of the chip options, that's all. Everyone has a coin they like for some it's a hobby, for others it's a business.The cost of entry for altcoins is pretty low and sometimes have a pretty cool community aspect.Sorry you aren't interested, have a nice day.

Awesome, thanks for the feedback.

Individualized is very expensive, I'm thinking of trying to make one with an inlay that a qr sticker can be put into.
@_date: 2014-12-15 19:19:15
Haha, thanks. I like this thing.
@_date: 2014-07-19 00:15:28
Thanks! 3USD, with free shipping, which is about a dollar.

I think I missed the joke here... I'm a bit slow I guess.
@_date: 2014-07-08 17:20:33
Sorry only have doge, lite, vert, and bit currently.
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:52:11
K. Not sure what you are so mad about. Thanks for your opinion though. :)
@_date: 2014-07-19 03:07:38
Awesome. Brb. Lol

I'm still on the fence a bit. The $20 thing hurt a lot, but I'm holding a small amount hoping to recoup some costs some day... Pipe dream I guess.
@_date: 2015-03-16 00:13:51
Dude don't even try. You know you stole my site and are using it to scam people.
@_date: 2015-03-15 13:06:52
Hey... It still has a lot of people holding it. :)

Hi guys I run cryptochips.net and wanted to chime in here.Many of you seem concerned about the paycoin chips and stickers. f1shbone is right. I make chips in whatever style people ask for. If there is enough of a demand, I'll make it. The same could be said about a few of the other coins that haven't done so well (tacocoin) but the paycoin chips are actually one of the most popular. I think people want to get something for their paycoin because they doubt it will ever rise in price.If anyone has questions please follow me in twitter  or catch me on IRC freenode  yakpimp. I've been doing this for a while and can show you lots of happy customers if you need.Thanks for getting this thread going.

I'm sorry, but it's one of the best selling items I have.
@_date: 2015-03-15 05:17:07
Scam site. 
@_date: 2015-03-29 14:15:19
No thanks. 
I can do QR codes on chips though. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 17:11:10
I appreciate the open communication.I get what you are saying, but there are many crypto that have died. It isn't about promoting or killing a coin. It's about providing an item for those who still follow it.It's kinda like saying not to sell Seahawks related stuff because they lost the Superbowl. There are still fans.

Can you PM me? I have a question about your address. I also emailed you.
@_date: 2015-03-15 16:57:23
I don't see the problem. I make a product with a logo on it. People buy it. It's not scamming them.They have paycoin and want a physical token for their pain. It's not like my chips are driving the price.Like I said earlier. Selling something with a somewhat dead altcoin logo on it does not make it a scam. Out of my designs there are only a handful that nobody would call a failure or scam.It doesn't change the fact that the chips are real, and pretty awesome though.Sorry that you disagree.

So for 150 I could do 75 chips. If you want QR then it would probably be more like 30 since I laser etch those and they take quite a bit of time to prepare. You could throw a hologram sticker over the QR I guess. I've typically done public keys though.
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:00:59
I can laser etch a private jet onto the chips. It just takes extra time.

This was to help with search engines, not sure if it makes a difference or not.
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:00:08
Thanks for the order... Maybe I'll throw in an extra.
