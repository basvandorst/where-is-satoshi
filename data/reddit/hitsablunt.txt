Way more than half of the people are below average IQ, Think about it. IQ can go up to 200+ as in some people actually have IQs that high, But it rarely goes below 40, im not even sure its possible tbh.
So considering the real average is around 103, and the bulk of people are 95 to 105, id wager like 60% to 65% are below average.

Yeah but no, A court ordered that President Trump can't block people on this "private platform" because his account is a source for public information. Twitter and Facebook have been flirting with whether or not they are a public service for a long time now.

Pareto distribution is the natural outcome of diversity in a group.
you then claim that the distribution is not fair... what?
We can debate this all day but whats your solution to these natural inequities?
@_date: 2018-12-18 19:00:08
Thats a false equivalency 
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:16:08
The pareto distribution is an attempt to model objective reality, an attempt to explain the facts.
In soviet russia when the Communists gained power they redistributed the farms because the highly skilled and capable farmers had acquired the most land over the years. To the uninformed it would appear to be unfair and that they had more than they deserved. So the farms were broken up into equal plots and distributed to the all the farmers, so then all the farmers had the same amount of land to work with. The resulting famine killed an estimated range of 10 to 100 million people.
The State can not solve social inequities and every time through out human history this has been attempted millions have died.
I would prefer a society in which the best singers are the singer, the best basketball players are in the NBA, the best actors are in movie leads, the best engineers design the products, the best money managers run the banks, the smartest among us are the scientist..... you get the point. If you took the best singer and put them in the middle of a NFL Game they would most likely get hurt and ruin the football game. 
You are just fixating on the fact the there are people that are super wealthy as if that is a bad thing. Most poor people that become super wealthy in some chance event like the lottery usually end up overdosing on drugs. There are certain skills, talents and self discipline needed to be come extremely rich, Most people dont have those. Ok some people inherited their money and haven't earned it, that is true but more often than not these people lose all of the inherited wealth because they dont have the skills needed to maintain it. Being wealthy is a skill just like playing Basketball, some people just dont have that skill.

@_date: 2018-12-18 21:25:01
So whats your solution?
I am saying its better to accept that these inequities exist and focus on things you can control, seems like you are claiming that the best course of action is to complain.

you could just not buy apple products... (I hate apple)
But that said the people who do use apple products feel that those products better their lives, wheres the harm i that? Apple is for the most part continuing to innovate and produce new technologies. Apple and the other big tech companies are bad examples becuase they have incestrious relations witht he US and Chinese governments allowing them to rig the game.
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:38:29
The most important aspect is discipline followed by raw intelligence. One can become more disciplined but so far we haven't found a way to make a low IQ person into a high IQ person, you can say that is unfair and it is. But its not a result of systemic oppression. It is a result of Genes.

ahh i see, you are applying your utopian ideals to nature.... and that's a fallacy. Have you ever been in a dangerous situation? I think you would change tunes rather quick.
Unfortunately in this reality humans are still animals and need resources to survive.


well that's only a benefit to evolution if what you love doing is becoming the fittest to survive...  If your true passion is making bracelets while im hunting and gathering food, you're going to die while i have food to eat this winter.... Sometime the brutality of life is going to force you to do things you dont want to do, and if you dont do them you die.

A Free market IS a healthy decentralized, natural system and they ALWAYS result in some form of unequal distribution because the underlying individuals that make up the system are unequal.
To attempt to solve these inequities would require a centralized system..... 
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:53:03


but are they capable of becoming productive members of society? Private charities work well at helping the poor because they can be discriminatory towards who they help, and only help those that want to change. When the state does it they have to help everyone one, and believe it or not most people are extremely lazy and will do the bare minimum to get along, regardless of what they want.... Hence the pareto distribution.


Lol duh, ugly people would rather be beautiful, short people would rather be tall. but life is unfair..
I thought you said you work in the financial industry? 


that's only possible because the state is there to supplement their incomes. simple supply and demand at work.


that means that 68% of households that receive food stamps have 0 wage earners...


did you know that raising the minimum wage is one of the drivers for inflation, like you said its money vs resources. if the state forces a company to raise its minimum wage that company is now paying more for the same amount of resources...
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:04:18
you dont think people that are 6'4 exist?
@_date: 2018-12-18 19:32:36
If you believe that society is built to keep you down and oppressed, you are not going to try to be your best self, you will ALWAYS have an excuse. But if you accept that life is unequal and unfair, and that we for the most part live in a Meritocracy especially in the US, you are much more likely to become your best self, via hard work and effort.

No really, there are a ton of references in Maps of Meaning that are references to other works that peterson has done.
but you are correct, he politically aligns with the left. Hes is also involved with the UN before he rose to fame.
@_date: 2018-12-18 06:36:58
so the entire point of what i just said flew right over your head lol
Their place is not the result of systemic racism or oppression, its the result of ability. One can become more capable regardless of race. Understanding the implications of the pareto distribution is actually empowering. That said there is some worth in a 5ft tall man accepting the fact he'll never be an NBA center.
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:35:59
Why is that a problem? do you not like Cellphones? Satellites? the internet? The wealthy dont waste their wealth, they leverage their wealth to create more wealth. This results in innovation and new technologies... How can you turn 1 million into 2 million? you have to create something that people want, could be new technology or it could be home loans, either way its a positive for society. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:00:08
so should I just be bitter and blame society for the fact that some men get more attention from women than I do because they are 6'4 and Im only 6ft? Or should i accept that im 6ft tall and get the fuck on with my life?
"God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,

You are the one being obtuse here bud. my analogy was not a non sequitur but a valid use case of the pareto distribution. 
"God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, And wisdom to know the difference."
that about sums up the benefit of understanding the pareto distribution.....
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:34:32
That's essentially the exact point i'm trying to make about the pareto distribution... people need to spend less time dwelling on the natural inequities of life and focus on themselves.
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:42:01
so does peterson believe in God? 
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:41:08
Ok so what are your solutions that wont get everyone killed? Just FYI every time in human history that these "societal inequities" were attempted to be fixed by force, millions of people died...

Understanding reality is alway better than lack of understanding. 
People blame NATURAL INEQUITIES for social injustice, when in reality they are the result of natural inequities of individuals, if one understand this they will know that the only thing holding them back is themselves which they have COMPLETE control over. 
Belief in system racism and oppression = no self control / no self responsibility.
understanding that social inequities are natural = self control / self responsibility.
pretty simple concept really
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:18:07
So whos gonna pay for that?
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:33:02

Read about the pareto distribution, it occurs everywhere in nature, from height distribution, wealth, size of trees in forest and even to the to the distribution of Peas on a pea plant. 
you are focusing on the wealth of the rich rather than the means the rich used to accumulate it.


Tell that to any animal that exists in an area with harsh winters, if you dont hoard you dont survive winter.
@_date: 2018-12-18 22:28:23


that's actually an impressive feat tho, as we advance it becomes more and more difficult to innovate so if we are still innovating at the same pace that we were 10 years ago, that's a good thing.
So as Apple provides more and mores services to people and becomes more and more integrated with our society, its important that they have enough money to stay afloat incase the market turns or some of their investments dont pan out. their pile of cash is a safety net incase things fail, and if things fail and apple use that cash everyone dependant on apples services will be thankful. If they operated on razor thin margins and something bad happened apple would just vanish, maybe another government bailout? But either way all of there services would cease to function and that would have a very negative ripple effect on society.

That is a nonsense idealistic immature view of nature. When living organisms are free they will kill and/or eat everything that is in their way..... Appeals to nature is a logical fallacy for a reason.
When a Lion takes over a pack he will kill and eat the previous lions kids.

Rich donate more to charity than the poor, who almost never donate money to charity. We actually need to tax the rich less so they can use their money to the benefit of society. An individual will always make better use of money than the government. When the State tries to steal from the rich the rich just protect their wealth and become "criminals" even tho it is the state pointing a gun at them demanding their money. In America the Rich already pay for everything.
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:55:24
we are talking about general statistics, there are no hard rules that apply to every one just trends. there are some short people in the NBA and some stupid people get rich.....  but that is abnormal.

Really? you are going to steer the conversation away from the pareto distribution than point the finger at me, I'm starting to think you are an idiot.

you tried to apply the definition of a corporation to the State and i am pointing out why that is a bad comparison....
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:57:10
it would help ALL social issues that are based in inequities, like rich people having more money than you, or really beautiful women getting all the attention...
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:42:24
A corporation is a group of people that have a shared interest and goals, in this context an individual and a company are the same thing.

So you are suggesting the State perform leg reduction surgeries on all the NBA players and giver their leg bones to short people?
we should surgically make Beautiful people uglier?
The whole point is the "societal inequities" are not fixable, there are an immutable manifestation of human diversity. Humans are not all equal. The sooner people accept that the sooner they can become their best selves.
@_date: 2018-12-28 18:51:09
Good one bucko! lol of course I can, I have listened to dozens of multi hour lectures from jordan peterson.
@_date: 2018-12-18 06:25:39
Kinda, The Pareto Distribution exists everywhere so naturally there will be this sort of distribution in society, it is inevitable. Understanding that it is an inevitable natural outcome of diversity explains the social inequalities in all categories without blaming systemic racism. If one is told that their groups lack of success is due to systemic racism and oppression, they are much less likely to succeed or even try to succeed. The truth is that the top end of these distributions are literally just better at it. The NBA has the best basketball players just like the "1%" are the best money "players". Simply put, Elon musk could do more with a million than you could with a billion.
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:53:39
No not at all, a government is a group of people with a monopolization of force. A government has the ability to FORCE people to do things. A corporation can not force people to do things, the corporation is subject to market forces while the Government is immune to them.
A corporation makes a huge public mistake, public loses faith and stops supporting said corporation and they go out of business.
A government makes a huge public mistake, and nothing happens....
