Yes, he has shared the first one, and various snippets of the others.  I found a few places where Mike has quoted a few lines of some of the e-mails.  Never in their entirety, though.

I don't know the whole history, but there was a Ripple project on sourceforge back in 2006 (I believe?).  It was a lot different than the modern Ripple, and had somewhat similar goals as bitcoin (although it still required some level of trust).  It failed to reach 'critical mass', and never took off like bitcoin.

I've had these e-mails for a few weeks now.  I analyzed each sentence closely before sharing.  I couldn't find anything that conclusively points in one person's direction, although that's not to say there isn't something there.

I understand some skepticism about all things Satoshi-related, but faking something like this would be a whole lot of work for no real gain.  I'm not another one of the many people out there who heard about bitcoin last week, and after 30 minutes with google, suddenly 'knows' who Satoshi is - those are claims that would require real proof.  I'm just sharing something I came in possession of that I found interesting.  How would you like me to prove it?

What's wrong with Mike Hearn?
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:00:58
That's fair.  Leaving in a more low-key way would have been better.  He was probably just trying to point out what he saw as critical issues with bitcoin though, in the hopes that they can be resolved.  To be fair, him quitting was his loss, and had no real long-term effect on bitcoin (the sign of a good open-source project).  Plus, he got what he deserved for quitting and selling his coins - just look how much the price has risen since then! :)

Not sure why this is marked as fake.  I will gladly forward the e-mails to anyone for more 'proof'.  That's the best I can do, unless Mike Hearn decides to comment.

Sure, I've seen that.  But no developer is allowed to quit a project they contributed so much to?  I don't understand why the bitcoin community is so divisive.  It's sad that Mike lost faith in bitcoin, but the beauty of bitcoin being an open source project is that there are others willing to take his place.  Should we hate Satoshi for quitting in 2010?
