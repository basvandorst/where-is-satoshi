Great idea. Keep in mind the legal hurdles that Comcast, etc. has paid our politicians to put in place are not small.

Agreed one is a security the other is a currency. The comparison makes little sense.

Well don't be absolute in your statement. You can launder money through the bitcoin system. Example you have $X you can't put in a bank account becuase it is tied to illicit activity Y, so you convert it to bitcoin, put it through a couple of washing machines, then deposited it in the bank account of your choosing. The point of laundering money is to hide the source of funds or hide the chain of custody bit coin can effectively do booth.

Hack the block chain? How is that possible unless you have majority of the mining power. The article is confusing.

It is true that Bitcoin will not be the most widely used cryptocurrency. 
The majority of the people using a blockchain as a currency will likely be using either: a centralized blockchain estabilished/sanctioned by their government, bank, or business, OR a decentralized blockchain designed with more appropriate currency controls and containing more business and law functions. Or a combination of both.  Any of these possible chains will be adopted more quickly than Bitcoin due to the support of the large stakeholders in the economy and the narrow value difference between the 1 unit of currency and the service or product being paid for. 
Bitcoin is more likely to be used as a type of bearer bonds. Exchanged for luxury items or other cryptocurrencys not for everyday services and products.

It says he was selling hash oil using Bitcoin to launder the money. 
Choose a better defendant.

Wait. If you have little Bitcoin the fees are going to be astronomical compared to the sum you are transferring.

Explain more.

There are legitimate reason to use Coinbase. For example they insure your Bitcoin against their negligence or employee theft. What other wallet offers insurance? It is also the largest exchange in the US and convient to use. 
They do have moderate fees. You are paying for extra protection.  Which is a problem for some users. 
They also hold your keys and require account verification.  Which is another problem for some users.
However, for the casual Bitcoin user Coinbase is a legitimate option. Especially if you don't plan on spending it.

Banning Bitcoin and banning ICO's are two very different things! News organizations are recklessly equating them as the same.

I don't know I have not checked in long while. But last time it was around it was more than $5. Coinbase fees are not calculate d the same as exchanges I think they shoot high to ensure transactions are processed.

If the Bitcoin you hold with them is a lot. Maybe write a nice email saying you are preparing complaints to the FTC, SEC, etc. They might pay attention with threats like that.

The insurance covers both Coinbase being hacked and employee theft. So what insurance do other wallets offer against being hacked? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:31:26
What "ban"??????
Please reference the ban you are referring to. My sources tell me of a policy change regarding ICO not Bitcoin and the possible regulation of exchanges.
As of today Bitcoin is NOT banned is China!

This s interesting the size of trades and the time stamps suggest they systematically bought and moved a bunch of BTC in large quantities. This is evidence of a institutional trader. But who? My bet would be someone already in the game but it could be JP.

Coinbase insurance against their systems being hacked. Here, it sounds like your login, which is your responsibility, was hacked. Sorry dude. You should cover your ass better.

Your would set a time table. It is essentially dollar cost averaging to make sure you get the best overall value while still having an income stream.
