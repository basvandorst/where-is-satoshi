This probably also falls under the caveat "if your bank doesn't suck". My credit union, for example, doesn't charge any fees to open an account. I just have to keep $5 in there and will get it back when the account is closed.

Just wanna say that I love sparkfun like I love bacon scented puppies.
Still, I would try to find a pick and place station to mount these. If a hobbyist is going to risk some cash getting these, maybe a good thing to do is check with the local makerspaces and see if one of the members has access to one.

Like you, I am wary about throwing around my bank account information. My solution was to to open a separate bank account for dealing with these, what I consider, more risky operations. I keep just enough cash in that account to cover my transactions and transfer money to it when I need to. If your bank doesn't suck, moving funds within the same bank should be a costless transaction. 
Since this account isn't tied to my "real" one, the risk of my important information getting loose is reduced.

IANAEE, but from the picture it looks like they are using ball grid array packaging. Nice if you have professional equipment but those are next to impossible solder by hand. I'd also like to see a datasheet...

Sounds a lot like the idea of [Social Credit]( It's an interesting idea that never really took hold. Possibly because the guy that came up with it was an antisemitic nutjob and nobody wanted to be associated with any of his crazy conspiracy theories.

Being a Slashdot reader for many, many years, I can say that while the commenters there mostly have technical backgrounds, few express opinions encumbered by facts or logic. Generally it's a bad idea to even try to engage them.
To quote Neal Stephenson, one of Slashdot's elder gods:
*"Arguing with anonymous strangers on the Internet is a sucker's game because they almost always turn out to be -- or to be indistinguishable from -- self-righteous sixteen-year-olds possessing infinite amounts of free time."*
