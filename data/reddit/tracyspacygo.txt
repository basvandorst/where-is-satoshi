could you please provide link?

and how it was? :)

yep, they are different and solve different problems and created for specific tasks, so in this case I there is no reason to choose the best one. The point is to describe each approach shortly so everyone can quickly understand how they work and what the difference.

I highly appreciate your scrupulousness (reg. Oxford Dictionary definition :) ).
If Total energy consumption = minimum energy needed to calculate hash/verify transactions etc(that allows network with some size normally operates) + energy consumption caused by increased machines power because of greed. So the 2nd term in my opinion is a wasteful computation. Ethereum also tries to decrease this energy consumption by using PoW but with greatly reduced block reward. And they also plan to use BFT mechanics additionally for safety reasons (&gt;2/3 of modes should verify block etc.). I'm not a fan of PoS at all, I'm just answering your question :)

as you know to create a block in Bitcoin case you should find nonce so that needed hash value &lt; difficulty (using brute force approach). as you remember, at the beginning mining was possible on cpu. But difficulty is growing in proportion to power of machines which mine :)   In other words, you make exact the same work(create blocks, validate transactions etc), but now should use for it more powerful machines because of growing difficulty. So this is so called wasteful computation. PoW is good approach, it work for trustless networks and encourage competition, but fact that its requires huge power consumption, that's it.

ok, there are lots of posts already written about this topic. As for my personal opinion, pow as the algorithm for bitcoin became kinda industrial standard and most of the algorithms compare themselves with it. In General to create a block in PoW you should have enough powerful machine in comparison with network difficulty and became the first who calculate needed hash. In PoS to create a block you should have bigger stake (amount of coins or coinage), but PoS is heterogeneous. So in general PoWs pros: security and cons: huge energy consumption for  wasteful computation - as a result it requaires good reward for miners. PoS is created to solve PoWs cons. Its pros: energy consumption is significant lower. Cons: still hight barriers to became a block creator (NEO for ex. requires 1000 GAS=38,000$ to became a validator), and bigger risk of forging ("Nothing at stack" problem). And one other point some PoS algorithms use complicated scheme how to choose block creator from eligible nodes to randomize blocks creators.

its really interesting, which countries are missing. What about Germany for example? 
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:34:37
Agree, but its part of important infrastructure

Just checked source -coin atms radar, according to it now its 591 atm in Canada

This chart is not prepared by me, its Statista. Maybe, if it will be a lot  of insights about different countries, i will prepare later updated chart myself 
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:50:50
It is statista chart, I suppose it based mostly on data from coinatmradar
