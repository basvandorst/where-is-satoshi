Regardless of how many people sign up is leading by example. Most people are non-technical. Technology needs to become basic education. Crypto currencies need to be included, if our societies are ever going to throw off slavery
We need more educators of crypto currencies and less traders who rely on KYC/AMA FX exchanges

The community should put more effort into pumping out use cases which clearly incentives bitcoins over other payment methods.
I love the idea behind purse.io Better returns than trading!
I love that CC costs businesses 2.9%+. At this point, Bitcoins is essentially free. Only if we could convince business owners that ~0% is better than paying 2.9%+. Elementary math shockingly not a strong point for many.
Need more of this!!

View prediction markets as just one use case. We need more use cases should be a common belief amongst bitcoiners
There are simple use cases out there which need more effort than coding skill

message can be condensed to
"The fact is there is zero reason [Ed "for avg folk"] to own or use bitcoin"
This is an inconvenient truism. Yet the bitcoin community continues to promote, "if only we could setup the shops around town to use bitcoin". Well how is that working out?! 
* bars, restaurants, and cafes don't matter. We are trying to setup other businesses instead of using the properties of bitcoin to our advantage.
* Only bitcoiners are security and tech savvy. A bitcoiner can't graft their knowledge onto a merchant. These people are for the most part incapable (bunch of backwards knuckle draggers). They can't learn and adapt quick enough. So the bitcoiner needs to be the interface with bitcoin savvy businesses.
* A merchant who wants to motivate bitcoiners HAS to provide that bitcoiner with an incentive. That incentive should be around the minimal amount the bitcoiner would expect to gleam from one trade (on an exchange). For me that is ~2.5%. Little secret, bitcoin savvy merchants care more about increasing sales volume than maintaining a meaty profit margin.
Bitcoiners are ur willing sales army. Incentivize 'em!! Factor in some flexibility, so the bitcoiner can up the product/services price at their discretion
Pat the bitcoiners on the ass, blow 'em a kiss for good luck, and send the army on their way. Before that deprogram them from thinking, "if only we could setup the shops around town to use bitcoin". Think that model is hurting us

look forward to reading the `electrum.server` code (again). Maybe more control over spreading out the traffic would mitigate the IP over time-span limitation

I see someone challenging a free network. There is something to be said for a member only network. \*\*In cryptocurrencies, there are transaction fees for a reason.\*\*
  
The attacker is merely reminding us why that is.  
Probably done by the folks selling load balancing hardware/services ;-)  
Cloudflare is that u?

I'm using \`custom code\` to connect to Electrum servers. Or i should say i'm using the Electrum API which connects to Electrum servers.  
As i'm currently testing code out, tend to run the same requests over and over again. Maybe 4-10 requests per minute while i'm coding.  
Hope any IP address based limitation doesn't cause Electrum API to become anymore unusable  
Also i'd like to micro manage the \`network\` to spread out the load. Electrum API is naive about this.

My experience serving as a remittance service.
A bitcoin savvy bar owner in Osaka, Japan had a tax bill to pay. US Gov't was going to start charging him 18% interest / day! He wanted to avoid the bank for some reason, Chinese water torture, pulling finger nails out, i can't recall the exact reason. We've all been there. The bar owner has a coinbase account and a fist full of freshly printed yen. 
Had bought at 27500 yen / btc ~ JPY / USD. The market was quite stable and was bouncing around 27500 yen / btc. Think by the time the transaction occurred the Japan market price was 27100 yen or 27400 yen. Basically i was out of the money. Charged 2.5% above my buy price. Now if the japan market price had gone above my breakeven i'd still just want the 2.5% above my buy price. Cuz 2.5% is good enough margin. So the sell price was 28188 yen / btc. Sold 440000 yen worth. Profit ~10000 yen (~USD$80).
Took a few days before could meet up. Had a scheduled Kansai Bitcoiners meetup at the Osaka bar so was going there anyways.
While the japan market price fluctuated. I could have sold and earned higher margin, but any first time experience is precious. And the US, at 18% interest, seems to be really hard up for cash.

Getting paid in btc is the way forward. Then a markup when using btc isn't as necessary
Only when selling btc on a local (Japan) exchange do i get hit with a 0.5% fee. If the trade fee is low then don't need a big discount when buying items / services

Here in Japan with the weakening yen, foreign people are willing to hold onto (ALOT of) btc. But they are a tiny minority. Vast majority of people in Japan, enjoy Starbucks, smartphones, and live with their parents.

The price will be set by what people are willing to pay for it. In the future 1btc will, mostly likely, be worth a LOT more. So what cost 1btc today might cost 0.0001btc someday in the future. So what. This won't impair the viability of bitcoin.
Think infinite divisible "but what if" topic has been beaten to death. Think we are past "What is bitcoins". We can move on

Believe the general rule of thumb (from the bitcoin 101 handbook) is that early adopters will be wealthier. We are still in the early phases.
In Japan, btc exchanges are trending as businesses that investors want to get a piece of. They never miss an opportunity to post to reddit, so we'll all be in the know.
Bitcoin can be infinitely divisible, so the finite number of bitcoins isn't an issue (worth discussing).
If profitability was everyones only concern than explain why there is even one bitcoin miner?
