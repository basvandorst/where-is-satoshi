@_date: 2018-01-25 17:48:16
That's awesome, good call... I'm part of the last November/December heard but I'm also slowly buying small amounts almost weekly.  Looking forward to a few months to now after this terrible dip...
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:47:43
Well good on you.  I'm part of that new blood that joined over the holidays.  In looking at projects that could be the next ETH or better/different which is why I'm heavy into platform coins and betting big on Nuls, my somewhat risky long term position.

Lots of YouTube influencers recommending moving half or most of your BTC to ETH so expect this to be the case for many folks now
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:59:43
The thing is though, are you buying BTC right now with fiat?  As of now, it does not have much practical use when ETH is way easier and cheaper to use to buy Alts.  I'm just getting in and don't think BTC is going to die anytime soon if ever but today, it does not make sense for me to buy BTC with fiat when I can go ETH to Binance to Alt, profit, diversify with bare minimum fees.

Ill have to look into more closely but how are you buying directly into Gdax exactly?  Right now I'm buying coinbase and will transfer to gdax.

I don't anyone would argue that the pros outweigh the cons with the US healthcare system.  The US can do sooo much better.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:08:54
Deposit a set amount every week so you have liquid to buy coin when the orice is right.

I'm verified with Gdax and just made a small deposit. Thank you for the guidance.

@_date: 2017-12-04 19:13:27
Congrats on the milestone!  Curious, what was your investment strategy exactly?  I see several purchases for a couple hundred and then several around $1-2k.  Did you just buy in when you could with what you could comfortably invest?
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:43:19
Shhh, maybe the IRS won't notice!  In all honestly, not having to deal with all the tax bullshit is a major reason why I am just buying and not selling at all.

Move your funds out of that shit hole asap.  It is your money bottom line.

You do not want to be living with your parents and not paying rent as an adult unless you have a clear short term timeline for you to save and move out.  Living with your parents can be a terribly destructive trap.  Destructive in that is saps your motivation to excel in life and be independent.

I will consider cashing some out in several years time but right now this cash money that I am investing is going to be locked up for better or worse for at least several years.  I'm not really into this for any short term gains in other words. Bitcoin is just another financial vehicle for me like my 401k's.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:48:24
Thanks for the info, I'm planning on setting up my gdax account tomorrow.  Do you prefer gdax over Gemini or do you interchangeably use them?
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:35:11
A fool puts 1k into BTC at 15k when they can invest into altcoin and multiply that in several weeks.  This is not agumentive but cold facts.  Bitcoin is important, but lagging because its not functioning as intended or at all at the moment.

Lol, man I love my parents but they are way, way too easy and still have a daughter at home, partially because they provide no positive pressure to move out.

You are the exact opposite of the type of person that has a calm, productive political conversation.  Just tone it down a bit man, this subs about BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:07:27
Which is exactly why BTC is not a viable currency at the moment.  No hate just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:33:42
It really truly does not matter what it's called or where it came from.  Let's just be adults and fix the fucking problem.  I really hate politics and all the bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:11:09
Not a chance as they will both coexist.  Altcoins provide much needed diversity and utility, they are only going up as well.
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:56:59
Yea of course, and I'm not knocking ya or anything either.  Those increased profits come at increased risk of course.  I just take comfort in having the bulk of my investments diversified in higher risk but relatively safe 401k and the like.  I'm just now starting to add 5-10% into crypto over the next year. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:45:27
This is exactly why I'm dumping into altcoins.  Bitcoin has a great promise but it is most definitely failing to deliver anything at this point while other better tech swallows up the market.  BTC may have some long term value but I'm not sure it will function in any other space than a store of wealth.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:58:16

Really, you absolutely must be unemotional to make any sort of rationale decision about all the crazy shit going on in the US.  Clearly, they weren't and I've been guilty as well.  There should be way more middle ground than the taints worth that most people have in this country.  Regardless, massive change is on the horizon.  The vast majority of people are sick and fucking tired of the torrent of bullshit that's currently being fed to them.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:42:01
Very nice.  Whats your buying strategy, credit card to buy on coinbase and then trade in gdax or something similar then pull off increments to cold storage?

All I can think of is [this when I hear old fucks talk about new technology.](
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:01:23
Curious, how often do you deposit bitcoin from gdax to your Ledger?  I was thinking of doing once a month, moving just a few $100 worth at a time.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:46:47
Actually I just checked and I'm at 22% for the year for my 401k  at my new job.  Lol obviously I haven't checked in several months and I'm actually quite surprised.

Yea I'm not trying to totally take away from their success at all.  However, do you think an average Joe from a middle to lower middle class would have the same odds of success that the twins had based on mental horsepower alone?  The benefits coming from their rather unique position dramatically increased the likelihood of them succeeding is all in suggesting.

Infinitely easier for them to have these chances coming from the top 1% and being surrounded by money, influence, power, and Ivy League education.  Still, to their credit they kept at it and they clearly are fairly competent business men (tip my hat).

"is the only thing that make me not want to move to the US"
You also really do not want to get sick or end up in the hospital, even with insurance.  The healthcare system is a complete train wreck and will put you in the same or much, much worse debt than student loans ever could.

Makes you think how much you've contributed to your 401k, or how poorly handled (by another company) that 401k is maybe?  I typically see about 8% growth year over year in my 401k.
Edit: Actually both my 401k accounts are up 17% and 22% respectively.  Pleasantly surprised by the growth this year as the last two have been about half those numbers or thereabouts.
@_date: 2018-09-21 10:53:58

With the majority of money flowing into Bitcoin coming from Tether, does that also mean that a big part of the Bitcoin being bought is not in fact backed by the dollar?

Noob here, but what are the most popular ways to sell off your bitcoin?  Do you sell your coins back for cash, gold, other cryptocurrencies?  
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:56:43
The fud from tether would torpedo faith in the entire market and I bet you many people would also exit their Bitcoin position as well until the dust settles.

Don't listen to any one person.  Due your research before buying a significant amount of Bitcoin.  Know one knows for sure where this is going but its exciting at the moment. One thing is for certain, your real world bills and needs will be waiting for you tomorrow so do not risk what you cannot lose.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:18:17
Just a gut feeling or is there some rationale?  
@_date: 2019-02-15 12:47:42
Competition is great, your attitude on the other hand is part of what's wrong with this space currently.

I don't think you need to read a single comment to come to this conclusion.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:47:18
Most people lost money in the stock markets in the early to mid 2000s.  Stock market has only slowing started growing past the last recession so they are far from the only ones.

Nobody knows the answer but discussing where the resistance is and support are informative.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:41:16
You bought more than you could afford if you can't pay rent.  Buy risky investment things like Bitcoin AFTER you pay for your needs like rent, food, medicine ect.
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:23:55
Absolutely, people gravitate towards and almost need that level of convenience these days.  If any crypto is going to be adopted to the general public it needs to be to easy to understand and use.
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:49:16
The lack of a mainstream, easy to use, all in one hardware wallet has been a hindrance for newcomers and a pain for "veterans" in this space.  This a great step in the right direction.
