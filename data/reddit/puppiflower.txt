What other explanation is there? did you see what happened during the Greek financial crisis? mt, Gox was offering three month waiting times just to get an account with them when that happened! Also there might be a low average wage in India but when you consider how many rich criminals there also are in billion or more populated nation then it's completely feasible that it's the result of the Indian currency crisis.

You mean, like there not being any paper money of any substantial denomination being available?

That's a huge chunk of the earth's population and despite the poverty, they are virtually all connected to the internet which means easy access to the BTC.
My feeling is the Indian government is covering up a huge financial collapse by stealth with a ruse of law and order enforcement, (wouldn't have been seen before anywhere else on Earth!) and they're hoping the Indian currency will diametrically shift to this digital currency instead of admitting to the crisis. 
That's what I was referring to in the original question.

Personally, I bought at 1 at @ $23.00 back then. The next week they were at $70.00 and three weeks later hit $123.00. 
I noted they'd fallen back once before in a small spike to around $12.00 so had little faith in them and spared my $60k the eventual losses sustained when Mt. Gox did it's 'exit scam'. Quite fortunate really. When the Greeks limited bank withdrawals there was a month long waiting list for a mt. Gox account. The BTC spiked at $1000.00 USD that week. Luckily Karpeles skimming bots didn't get me! And, honestly, he, Mark Karpeles, that is,  'definitely' had 'nothing to do at all, ever' with any of the financial aspects of the original (patsied) Ross Ulbricht created Silk Road experiment. Why would he?  
I guess none of which is news here... 
but hey, what do I know?
I'm just the window cleaner.

Not even all of the multi-millionaire drug dealers and etc. feverishly exchanging their fortunes for as yet untraceable monero cleansed anonymity?

BTC has also steadily risen to nearly $1000.00 USD for the first time in quite a while and it's been speculated that the blockchain is threatening to slow unconfirmed transactions down to 72 hours for the first time, ever, given the sudden increase in trading that's being experienced this month. This I attribute to the Indian economic situation, but like I said...
