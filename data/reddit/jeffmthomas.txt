"Indeed, it has been banned in two different countries—Thailand and China—and South Korea stated that it will not recognize Bitcoin as a legitimate currency."
Yeah.... We should definitely be following those countries' example....

I bought 14 GoxBTC off of someone for .69 BTC. I have now managed to trade that up to 50 GoxBTC. Really hoping I'm going to be able to withdrawal.

Yeah I'm not going to promote any sites on here. I'm sure some can be found through a search.

I'm currently working on a service that will allow you to do this. We are hosting the blockchain for each coin we support in our own local database. I will update this thread in a week or two when I do my initial beta release.

Haha sorry... Missed that. I paid for a sushi lunch with BTC yesterday and immediately regretted letting those bitcoins go.

As you can now see... My gamble doesn't look like it's going to pay off. Lol. Oh well.

This will have been an expensive game when Bitcoin hits $10,000.

I feel bad for them too. But I am also taking the risk that I will never be able to access those BTC. Worth the risk I think.

The exponential growth has to stop at some point. The question is when that is going to happen.

Oh I'm not sweating it. I knew it was a risk when I bought GoxBTC. Never bet what you can't afford to lose, right? I do really feel bad though for the people that had all of their bitcoin trapped in Gox before all of this started going down.
