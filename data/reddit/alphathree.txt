at least it says that people in china wants to buy BTC, in an exchange or through a less convenient LB. We do need a decentralized exchange tho, its true LB can also be cracked down. the thing is once you know a few traders on LB you dont have to transact anywhere.

cool man, thx for your answer. ill be thinking a bit and get back to you.
@_date: 2017-02-10 12:12:14
what platforms?
@_date: 2017-02-24 14:38:49
the economy is not infinite either.
@_date: 2017-02-21 03:37:45
ok cool will send you a msg soon!
@_date: 2017-02-21 13:14:30
thx for your answer, what do you from the stack?
@_date: 2017-03-01 11:26:36
well thats just your story. I bought gold at $800 some years ago, and sold at 1200, to materialize it in my house. Before bitcoin existed. Same happens with a few trillion people over the centuries. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 11:30:35
bitcoiners that dont like gold are such a contradiction. I was buying gold years before btc existed and will continue doing so. I dobuy BTC regularly aa well. But gold doesnt fork or shake much really.

it was a pseudo-joke. Blockstream is funded by AXA. One of the most powerful banks in the world. This is public knowledge, you can certainly ignore it. 
AXA's CEO attends Bilderberg Meetings. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 03:13:34
thx for your replay man. what is your focus on dev? what part of the stack?
@_date: 2017-02-28 08:51:58
or sell outside.. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 18:02:00
a lot of us are bilderberg employees in some form.
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:09:00
the Bilderberg employee won?
I think a lot of people agree Bitcoin is lagging behind and slow. Would be easier if Bilderberg Johnny and his friends pushed a 2mb update and move on with their master plan that will never happen. just for the sake of making sense to the non 1% that want to use btc as a currency.
I bought an ice cream with btc yesterday, 50min confirmation. Makes no senae if Bitcoin is a P2P CASH SYSTEM.
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:50:44
I personally think instant confirmations without any extra work is the only thing that makes sense. this lag makes no sense. I stand on the side where avoiding delays is PRIORITY.  Thats technololgies edge, the obvious factor everyone focuses on when creating a system. and competing with other systems.
Core is clearly not willing to innovate. Being the biggest Dev team in the world dedicated to one coin.  2mb block is not a big deal, it shouldnt even be an issue at this point in time. The Bitcoin blockchain should have space for all sorts of applications and uses. And 1mb is not going to cut it, and is not a very risky change either. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:52:41
they just dont want to open the gates man. crypto is booming world wide. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 18:19:55
their model is doomed, of course they have the money to adapt and change. Thats why they invest and get involved in companies like Blockstream. Deep pockets always find a way. 
This new freedom hopefully is really inevitable. As it changes everything. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 11:28:20
the use in electronics, cables etc is intrinsic. Likely jewelry as well. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:18:48
Im not from the US anymore, dont have major dear of the IRS, used it a couple of times while living there.  what do you think is the biggest concern if not the id+logs.
funny thing im sure 90% of users were harmless nerds. US has become stupid compared to other countries.
@_date: 2017-01-17 11:40:04
yes, people like to hype things. There is more people aware in Argentina, some amount of users I guess. 99% of peeps anyways have no idea what it is. So clearly not booming. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 16:49:09
already have part of my stash out. who is "us" ? bitcoin community is pathetic. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 13:36:40
i like the sentiment, and vision. 
You should learn the value of getting there first as next lesson.
@_date: 2016-12-28 15:24:57
would be nice to just hold value, less like a bank account, more like cash or gold. i guess :)
@_date: 2017-01-15 18:06:19
would say the opposite, these shows ask for common knowledge and educate people on these basic things they dont know. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:33:02
not if you bough bitcoin yesterday. he just lost a lot of money for that stupid digital transaction. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:01:06
serious answer, to me they suck. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:37:27
i was saying that if you buy one whole BTC. its almost 100usd of fee. nice business model
@_date: 2016-11-24 14:04:45
its shame other coins are way faster, scalable, and all that. today. And we are waiting for some master scheme. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 23:06:12
then you probably dont understand it.
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:30:26
yeah, nothing new in bitcoin land. there is risk, and they have to cover their asses. but the botomline in that scenario is not great. You can buy a full meal with that fee just that sole electronic transaction.
@_date: 2016-12-28 15:23:34
its not anonimity per se, there will always be a last input thay says when that money got in. right?
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:25:05
its still a lot on fees, we all understand the magic of bitcoin, but thats expensive. in todays values 12% is almost 100usd. this is supposed to support cheaper schemes.
@_date: 2016-12-24 11:26:48
are you 12?
@_date: 2016-12-11 11:33:54
this guys ATM doesnt help bitcoin really.. its scary 
@_date: 2016-12-30 09:51:59
agree, the problem is not bitcoin, is greed. And bitcoin is flooded with it. even tho some people say it will "help" the poor, most people wouldnt give a satoshi to other person.
@_date: 2016-12-25 18:11:31
I personally think there is speculation, and my mind wonders in that space and buys more BTC just for the future vision. 
Good thing is use cases are real. Im from Argentina, and starting to have an option to transact makes perfect sense. The local currency devalues 40% a year, and banking is a hassle. 
India is also a huge market starting to awake. The remmitance volume in this country is huge, basically smartest indians move to the US and send money back. These guys will rock the boat IMHO. Indians are not stupid and will value the freedom. 
I obviously accept bitcoin for my freelance work, not a lot of companies or people pay with it though.
I pay when makes sense with it. At least in my opinion credit cards are a pain. All my US cards get locked for security reasons when i buy software, or travel. And have to call customer service, or fill forms (Verified by Visa), and who knows if it will go through because of so many rules and security checkpoints. 
Massive speculation is real, massive upside is also real IMO.
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:34:58
not everyone buys to hold, and not everyone should buy to hold. you might need to send money abroad, and those fees are competing with crazy western union. 
@_date: 2016-09-17 13:52:36
R&amp;D with no dates? Thats not my experience and worked in major tech companies. 
@_date: 2016-09-04 06:39:41
good for them, im talking to the speculative majority. 
@_date: 2016-09-18 08:44:50
there is something of that, but usually when there are a ton of competing products gaining traction, then or you innovate further, or you stop R&amp;D. The point is to innovate. At this point BTC is not innovating any more. What are they researching? They can look for features on 10 different products around them.
