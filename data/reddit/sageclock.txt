Better to sell it now and have the money for the house then hold on and risk watching the price crater and get to the point where you can't wait anymore and you end up selling a lot more of your stack than you're comfortable with.
Our house hunting had almost perfect timing and I cashed out a good chunk of my Ethereum gains just a few days before it started to crater (I think I sold at ~$1300) back in 2017.
I had the money in hand for the downpayment and I didn't have to sweat bullets by waiting a few days and watch it take a tumble. In retrospect I got pretty damn lucky, as I was counting on being able to use that.
Although I was a bit unlucky in that I should have just sold everything I had at that point, instead of just most of it, especially since Ethereum hasn't been invited to the bull run party anywhere near as much as Bitcoin has.

You could say you lost your key, or didn't properly back things up and the computer it was on failed, or got hacked, etc, and turn it into a lesson to them on how to properly secure whatever they have as well.

Did you have no access to any money? You could have bought as little as $100 worth of bitcoin then then and had ~$73,000 now, assuming you held for 6 years. I know back then it didn't seem like it'd ever go up this high (I was following it back then myself), but you could have dipped your toe into it instead of just not bothering at all.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:49:26
I buy $20 worth a week, on an autobuy, so it happens the same time every week. I'm buying a ridiculously low fraction now, but it's better than nothing, and it used to be a lot higher fraction. Do it for long enough, and it can add up over time. Although $20 a week is starting to feel kinda low now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:24:41
Then I'll be getting more bitcoin the weeks that it's down. I don't see a problem with that :).
The $20 a week is money I can easily afford to lose.

This may be too small of a blip on the radar, but hopefully you'll consider it.
There's an organization in the Midwest US called the Shiba Inu Rescue Association (or SIRA) that has seen an huge influx of Shibas this year, especially ones with medical problems, and they've been hurting for money. My girlfriend and I have given them money several times this year, but we only have so much to give.
There's a more personal reason as well. Earlier this year our Shiba puppy slipped his harness and was lost for a full week, and volunteers from SIRA helped us find him. We've been extremely grateful for all the help and assistance they provided us, so if this can help them out further, it's worth it. If not, I understand.
Here's their [website]( but their [Facebook]( seems to be more active.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:43:04
Yep, that's happened a lot. Most recently I had a friend tell me in June this year to sell my bitcoin because "it's totally in a bubble and it's going to crash soon", when it was making new all time highs at around $2500 a coin back then. Even if he were right, I still would have held and rode it out.
My father used to laugh at how low bitcoin's price had gotten during the time it was in $200 purgatory forever and how it was backed by nothing and would be worth zero someday. He finally started buying bitcoin when it hit $2000 a coin, which thankfully still ended up being a good time to buy.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:18:47
Yep, I take that into account when trying to determine what the price could get to. It's an essential part of the equation.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:33:11
Again, as long as you hold (and it can be hard to hold when it drops that much, but it's possible), you lost nothing. It's just an imaginary number at that point. You still have the same amount of the asset you had the entire time, it's just that you're going to have to wait a bit longer to find someone willing to pay what you want them to. It's not too much different than the people holding on to bitcoin now waiting for it to get up to $50k, $100k or whatever number they have in their head. If someone seriously offered me $50k a coin to sell what I've got right now I'd be happy to, but they're not, so I'm going to keep waiting until that time (or if it looks like bitcoin might not be the future anymore).
I held some during the time it was in the $200s. I just stopped checking the price for a little while. I still believed in the value of the technology so I saw it more as a something to endure, and was confident it'd eventually go back up to at least $1000 again, maybe $2000 if I was lucky.
The only time I sold during that time was when I was broke and needed a little extra to float my bills for a bit longer, and sold a little over 1 btc when it was around $500 at the time. Which yeah, it'd be nice to have still have that now, but I would have rather not been in a situation where I was broke then instead, because if I was fully employed at that time I probably would have put accumulated 5-10 btc while it was around $200-250 a coin.
So yeah, honestly I'm more mad that I was struggling with my finances back then so I could have been buying it the whole time.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:53:24
So because no forks are currently planned, there won't ever be another one?
I think he's suggesting that some people won't be content with bitcoin not generating any more coins once it reaches 21 million, and might push for something crazy to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:20:37
They lost nothing if they didn't sell. It was still a little depressing though, just because you want to see bitcoin keep having success after success, but to have to sit and wait as it stumbled (especially that two year long stumble).

I bought ETH at $11 myself, but only about $100 worth ("what I could afford at the time"). In retrospect, I should have shifted a good chunk of my other coins into ETH, as I was pretty certain it'd go up (I was thinking at least 10x over the course of the next year, not 40x over two months). If I had, I would be debt free right now. Not complaining, but still, regret.
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:55:07
I'm also interested in how you built that. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:23:48
This is what I do. Do this for a year and (depending how fast it shoots up) you could probably end up with at least half a coin by next year.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:02:36

He's saying that people tend to report ATH's on a daily basis, but if you take it on a smaller basis (let's say, seconds, not days), every time bitcoin reaches an ATH and goes up even a penny more a second later, it just made another ATH, and so on, until it finally drops and stays below the previous high.
I.e. lets say bitcoin reaches an ATH of $20000. Ten seconds later, it goes up to $20001. That's another ATH. Two seconds later, it goes up to $20002. That's another ATH. Near the end of the day, the price goes up to $20046. If measured on a dollar basis, it probably hit 46 or more ATH's that day, but the media will just report it as "Today, bitcoin reached a (single) ATH of $20046!" but really, technically, it hit a whole bunch of ATHs.

Well they called the dot-com bubble a bubble, and it didn't go down to 0 and stay there once it burst. Same with the real estate bubble that burst in 2008. There are several people that think we're in a student loan bubble, and that the stock market in general is a bubble on the verge of bursting again, but none of those will retrace 100%.
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:45:01
Not this year. This year has been pretty flat. And it's possible the stock market is about to enter a bear market also. I still keep putting money in my 401k regardless though. I don't need to touch it for a long time. Same with crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:03:48
Yep, there was a time when that was what we speculated bitcoin could get to. There might have been a couple of people on forums saying $10k, but those seemed really out there. Even $1000 seemed like wishful thinking back then.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:06:02
The day ETH was added to Coinbase (at $11 a coin) was a no brainer to me (I figured making it that easy to buy would get a bunch of new people into it). I got as much as I could afford extra from my current paycheck, but in retrospect I should have shifted other money around and went in even harder. I could have been up $80k or more if I had shifted investments. I only thought it was going to go up to $30-40 a coin in the next year, though, not $400. I bought a bit more at $45 a coin, and again at $93 a coin, based on the news I was seeing at the time, and since then I've just been DCA'ing it, getting a little every month.
So yeah, if you are super confident it's about to shoot up, drop a good chunk into it right away. But if you're not, and I have no idea where Ethereum will end up at this point (I don't think it will drop too much more long term, but that's really all I feel confident on), DCA makes more sense.
Also in order to drop a good chunk into anything at this point I'd have to liquidate other investments I'm wanting to go long on, which I'd rather not do, and haven't been in them for a year so I'd get hit with a higher tax rate if I shifted those around anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:36:26
You could have both. My girlfriend and I have individual accounts, but also have a joint account we put some money into every month, that we use to save for bigger things (downpayments, vacations, etc).

That's what I'm doing. A $20 auto buy every week. The equivalent of going out to a sit-down restaurant for lunch once. I probably would have spent it on just that otherwise. I won't miss it if I lose it all. All this drop means is the next autobuy I get a bit more bitcoin.

* The $30 meals are the days I go get steak or sushi. Usually only once a month.

Why this argument of theirs is specious at best. This is no different than the stock market, other than as a whole, the stock market is less volatile. But individual companies can still have huge swings in price (the company I work for this year's stock dropped 36% the day they released their most recent quarterly report and is still down, and they're a Fortune 500 company, for example).
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:39:42
Pre-November 2011 bitcoin holders exist on this Reddit, and most likely have his exact mindset because they've gone through this many times already. Those people probably mined coins on their computer, though, because it was actually possible to do so back then, and it was a lot, lot harder to buy.
You didn't have exchanges back then, just LocalBitcoins or random strangers on forums you had to trust, because the transactions were irreversible. I never could get over the trust aspect, but if I had just thrown $20 to get like 1000 bitcoins back then, I'd be set for life today.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:39:44
Don't feel too bad about for only investing what you feel comfortable. I've had to sit and watch as it's rose from $200 up to $2000 while going through financial problems and not having any money to invest. I wish my situation was different then, but it wasn't, so I don't feel too bad about it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:18:53
50% for two months ain't shit. I bought some bitcoin at $800 (that was on its way down, I was trying to 'buy the dip') and watched the price topple to $200 and stay there for two years. Still held. Could have taken a loss at some point, but instead I just stopped watching the ticker for awhile and now, even after losing 50% recently, the price is currently 10x more than what I put in.

And quite a few people hand their life savings to conmen, waste it in casinos, to start a business without a clue and ignore all advice or warnings about their chosen product or market and don't get any traction (I've worked for a company that had one of those people as a client, and over a year and a half watched him waste $5 million of his money on his delusions of grandeur... we did try to make the best product we could for him, he just sabotaged it every step of the way), all sorts of dumb reasons. We can't protect all fools finding some way to give away all their money. Even if bitcoin didn't exist, they'd find something else.

I probably bought at least thirty 10,000 bitcoin pizzas (I mean, I bought thirty pizzas, not using bitcoin) that year. Thanks for putting that into perspective.
Back then I didn't feel comfortable giving money to faceless strangers for bitcoin, which was the only way to get it besides mining. Didn't really feel like I could trust them enough. Although I should have risked at least $20 worth once and gotten a pizza's worth, in hindsight.

I do this. $20 * 52 weeks out of the year = $1,040 put in, or 0.2 BTC at the current rate. It's not amazing, but it's better than just waiting and waiting and waiting forever.

I did say before Nov 2011. I wasn't thinking about it too much, but I was probably thinking more around 2010 when I said no exchanges. Also Mt. Gox was sketchy as hell even before the hack, and you had people warning everyone not to use it (and people using it anyway). I debated using it to buy some and decided against it. Ended up being a wise decision, as I probably would have lost it all, as they disabled withdrawals from their system a bit before it all came toppling down.
I guess you did say 'just for fun', but the tone of your post made it sound like you didn't believe anyone from back then would be on Reddit, let alone believe this stuff, so you needed to see physical proof in order to give any weight to the points this guy was making. I was just saying, I know there are people from that far back, and projecting a bit from my own experience, they most likely would have similar opinions, even if they aren't the actual OP, because they've been through this shit multiple times already.
This subreddit and what's getting screamed about here are almost exactly the same in the tone and debates about "this time it's different!" as the last 6+ times this has happened. In fact it might actually be less serious, surprisingly. There was suicide watch posts pinned to the top of the subreddit previous times, for one. I'm surprised we don't already see that this time.
History is basically repeating itself, once again, just the numbers are different this time. Is that a guarantee that history will repeat itself completely and we'll see a big boom eventually? No, of course not. But it's looking damn similar right now.
For people who have only been here a few months, they might not realize this. They see all this negativity for the first time and think "Fuck, the jig is up. Better get out now!", but for long-term people, it's just "Here we go again."

The hodl was rough. I literally stopped looking at the bitcoin charts for almost a year during that time. I felt confident the price would increase eventually, but it was too depressing to see no significant change one way or another for two straight years.
I do wish I wasn't going through financial problems at that point and had bought more than I did, though. If only I had $3000 to invest back then...

Not just tech bros anymore. Stock market bros are starting to get in on it. For example, I talked to my mortgage lender about it, and he said "I had clients talking about Bitcoin for years and it just went right over my head.

Depending on where he buys the crypto from, he could get eaten alive by fees this way. Like if he went through Coinbase, for instance. Better to do fewer transactions. 2-4 a month is still probably fine, but every day wouldn't be. If he's doing it through an exchange, sure, but he'd have to remember to do it every day. Coinbase you can schedule recurring buys so it happens without you even having to think about it.

Threads about the price have pretty much always dominated this Subreddit when the price moves dramatically (up or down).

I paid for a downpayment on my house by selling some Ethereum back in January. Two days later the bear market started. I should have sold everything I had in retrospect, but at least I got lucky and sold that much when I did. It's not a luxury hotel in the Pacific Islands, but I'm very thankful we decided to buy a home when we did and didn't wait to do until later. I actually felt bad about selling it and debated waiting a few days because I thought it was going to keep going higher, but thankfully I didn't.
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:17:11
It needs to stabilize a bit before that's reasonable. If I buy bitcoin (with the intent to use to pay goods), and a day later it goes down another 10%, then I paid that much in tax just to say I paid for goods and services in bitcoin. If it's converted at point of sale that's a little different, granted, but the store will just immediately convert it to USD anyway so there's little gained there except for a stat for that one company that someone paid for it in bitcoin. If things stabilize (or start going up again) then maybe it would be worth doing, but the volatility is just too crazy and all going in one direction right now.
@_date: 2017-06-12 00:07:58
Just set up a recurring purchase for ~$20 a week at Coinbase. I did that and slowly accumulated a decent amount over time. Also look into altcoins for other possible opportunities. Those are much bigger gambles but you can still make a lot if any of them hit their stride for a small investment.
Just not that right now Conbase's fees are high because mining network fees are way up, but that should hopefully drop back down with Segwit.
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:38:22
Okay I guess I need to know more about Coinbase Pro. When I buy from there I see $2.99 fees for as little as $20 purchased, which is a lot higher than 0.3%. What does Coinbase Pro entail, just linking up your bank account? I thought I had already done that.
Edit: Just actually checked and it's a lot cheaper now than the last time I checked, at $1.49 for $20. But that's still 7.5%, not 0.3%. I guess I don't have Coinbase Pro. I don't see any mention of Coinbase Pro on my account, though, like even where I'd sign up for it.
