And N. Korea may be in cahoots with China on bitcoin mining. 
And China is setting up border camps getting ready for the N. Korean regime to collapse. 
And South Korea holds an emergency Bitcoin-tax- anti-money laundering - meeting. 
So is China getting ready to seize the N. Korean bitcoin mines? Will that bring down N. Korea? Will S. Korea have reunification with N. Korea? Will they want some of that bitcoin to pay for rebuilding?

Unfortunately a lot of biology behind tribal behavior, humans are wired that way. 
I heard someone say that if you look at primate species, you'll find mothers cuddling infants, adolescent males having at it, adult males hunting, etc. across all species, including humans. 
The difference is that, if you say to a monkey, "Give me a banana now, and when you die, you'll have unlimited bananas," that won't drive any gears with the monkey. But many humans are totally ok with this. So human primates have imagination -- and so, like unlimited bananas,  political borders are an imaginary story that humans agree on. (Sometimes.)
So that's what fascinates me about bitcoin. That humans are all agreeing that it's a store of value. (Or currency.) That to me is amazing. Beyond tribalism.

Ok, and I'm not an advocate of the "NSA is Satoshi" theory, but the rationale is that fiat-backed money will be obsolete anyway, so may as well get in front of the inevitable replacement. So they made the code to be acceptable to anarchists (decentralized and no personal identity attestation), so it would be adopted and not screwed with. Because the devil you know is better than the devil you don't. Or something like that.
I'd feel better if this could be totally negated, even if Satoshi's identity is not known definitively.

They (big banks) can't even figure out who all the counterparties are to make a "living will" per Dodd Frank. So he's right, they made such a mess out of things , they have no idea what's going on, and the counterparties in "affiliates" are likely to collapse the system every few years. (Sry for using the banking jargon.) Warren Buffet called these "weapons of financial mass destruction" or some such.
(Basically, the resulting banking law Dodd-Frank is supposed to prevent the need for taxpayer bailouts, by requiring banks have either a bankruptcy plan, or a "living will" for winding down derivatives. And they are so messed up they can't figure it out. )
They are counting on taxpayer bailouts, and think elected officials are dolts if they don't so pay the ransom for holding the economy hostage. 
And, now, just get rid of Dodd Frank because it's too hard, they say in a whiney voice.

OK, have to dust off my GS hate, haven't used this since the 2000s. If I were a vampire squid, I'd:
1. Own as much mining as I could. (My theory: Iceland.)
2. Own as much of exchanges as I could, or start my own. 
3. Using 1 and 2, front run as a matter of business strategy. Crypto eliminates the need for colocation HFT. 
4. Profit.

Question if you know: doesn't the lightning network for BTC make Litecoin redundant? (Except as a separate kind of crypto, with its own ecosystem.) 
You said something like the lightning network would basically make having a BTC "checking account" with low transaction cost easy peasy. I thought that was one reason for Litecoin, that Bitcoin was too slow/expensive to use, so Litecoin was to make a currency that's easy to use.

It is definitely "buyer beware" as in an unregulated market.
 Presumably the transparency prevents fraud (e.g. fake prices ). 
If you think that the block chain itself is founded on fraud, then that is a pretty good reason not to participate.

Ha. Just googled that. You can't make this stuff up. (Don't know why this story strikes me.)
Why would the state-owned pool be empty? Because the Ukranian government is too broke to have a public pool? Because the politicians looted the money?
 And then sought to protect their ill-gotten gains in cryptocurrency? And so used the empty pool to mine more, instead of having a nice public pool for people to swim in. (I'm guessing about all this.)
I'd like to see a photo of the Bitcoin mining in the empty swimming pool.

He conflates the entities that are centralized, with having a choice whether or not to use those entities. (And, different cryptos are different, so this generalization is kind of invalid anyway.)
I really don't get the Gini comment. So if the amount in different wallet (addresses) are bimodal, in that there are lots of addresses with a little bitcoin, and lots with a whole bunch of bitcoin, this doesn't reflect the same Gini coefficient in individual net worth. It reflects things like the FBI has a bunch in an address that it confiscated from Silk Road, or that exchanges hold a bunch in addresses. And then individuals have single digit or fractions thereof in other addresses. So there really is no need for addresses with middle-of-the-road amounts. (I'm talking mainly about Bitcoin here.
It's like saying the US economy is very unequal because banks hold lots of money, and individuals hold very little. Like comparing apples to Thursdays. The true comparison is banks to banks, and individuals to individuals, apples to apples.(And the GINI is increasing in the US.)
Maybe the mining is centralized, but that's market forces, like cost-of-electricity type of thing. 
Maybe he's in love with North Korea, I hear love is in the air with those folks.

Disclose you have crypto, but don't put it under their management. (Assuming you don't want to liquidate.)
Wealth/Financial Advisors charge about .5-1% of assets under management (on top of any fees charged by the underlying asset, such as a mutual fund fees). So if you  put your crypto accounts into being managed, that will add to the fees charged. 
I  told my Financial Advisors about my crypto and about the returns, but have my account separately. I just call them every once in a while and tell them that the return for this year in crypto is 1000% or so, and what have they done for me lately? :)

Shorts need to buy the asset to cover, if the price goes up when the contract expires.
For shorting stock, if there aren't enough shares, I've had brokerages contact me to pay me to "rent" my shares to cover shorts made by others. (Declined.) If there aren't enough shares to cover, that can be a "short squeeze" and the stock can go up.
Will BTC shorts need to cover if the price goes up before contract expiration, and what if there aren't enough BTC for sale to cover their short? 
My guess is that miners would also be short sellers, as a hedge, which is good. They wouldn't have to put so much of their own capital at risk then, which would encourage more mining. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:35:05
It's tricky because bitcoin is treated as a commodity, so a futures contract is the right to purchase, say, pork bellies, at a set price in the future. So it's settled in cash. LIke a stock option. The right to buy $10,000 bitcoin for a strike price of $8000.
For a put, it's the right to sell at a set price in the future. Like the right to sell pork bellies at $10 when the price at that date is $8, so you're $2 ahead. Settled in cash.
For short selling, usually you need to "borrow" the stock, but you can have naked shorts. 
Have to read up on "married puts" ! Maybe they can live together first. :D
So I'm getting confused treating bitcoin like a commodity (futures contracts, right to buy at a set price in the future) versus treating it like a stock, where there has to be enough shares to cover.

Hi u/SteveBozell,
OK, not an expert or anything.  
Why the huge ratio here -- 32 to 1? 
This isn't to speculate on why tech is so male-centric generally. (As far as historical, I just meant that tech has had issues attracting and retaining women. This has been chronicled elsewhere, e.g.,  Pao v. KPCB.  And all the discussions thereafter.)
The question at issue is why the current ratio is roughly 32 men to 1 female as far as bitcoin ownership.
I'm in the SF Bay area, and go to tech meetings, lately dealing with finance/distributed ledger/blockchain/crypto. I see lots of younger men from diverse backgrounds, and perhaps first generation immigrants. (Who are extremely inclusive to everyone that I've seen.)
If a person has sophisticated scientific/tech education, and their home country currency isn't very stable, home country tech jobs don't pay that much, US jobs have discrimination, then hey, why not set up mining operations?
Also there may be some Silk Road residual business, which was predominantly male, as I understand it. (No data on that.)
But, why mostly men? Perhaps cultural reasons in the home country? (Sorry, don't mean to offend, just a guess.) Although, there about equal numbers of international women in STEM grad schools, I think. 
Again, this is tricky to discuss, and apologies if I come off like an asshole. Blanket apologies, and I'm just reaching for a reason why it's 32 men for every 1 woman. 
**TL; DR: Total WAG why it's 32:1 is that more early adopter male miners in low electricity rate countries.**

Totally anecdotal, n&lt;10:  Not much widespread knowledge. 
Asked my Google engineer neighbors, and some software engineering friends who work/have worked at Amazon, FB, Zynga and a coupla other tech-related companies, as well as some UC Berkeley CS grad students. While they are interested in block chain/distributed ledger, they haven't followed Bitcoin in any detail. 
I think they get specialized and so don't get up for air to look at other areas. 
I was told there were CS classes at Berkeley in 2009-10-11 that had students buy Bitcoin. One student sold, in 2013, 7 of her Bitcoin she mined herself in class, and bought a very nice pair of shoes, (Yep, 7 x $4500 = $31,500, I think she sold for $20 or so. We don't talk about those shoes too much.) 
Also asked some PE/Finance industry folks, who similarly are interested, but don't have any position papers or anything they could show me.
So, being the old lady in the crowd, there are no young'uns to explain this stuff to me. 
Good for nothing slacker millennials. Get off my lawn.
Edit:  I got interested after getting a free ticket to a conference in SF in 2014, where the Sr. and Jr. Drapers spoke, and apparently they won the Mt. Gox auction for some bitcoin, and the founder of Coinbase was also on the panel. So it sort of was an SV thing, but I was there as a casual observer.

For court cases under a governmental jurisdiction, there may be a "standing" issue if no one is particularly injured (so there is no case in controversy, strictly speaking). 
But, for ICANN, I think a class of people, who can swear they mistakenly thought bitcoin.com and bitcoin cash was Bitcoin itself, that may justify removing the domain from the owner. 
For twitter,FB, telegram, and other private social media, that would depend on their own terms of service, but I would think this is sufficiently misleading that the relevant usernames/accounts could be suspended.
The name "bitcoin" may itself be generic, but it does refer to a specific thing -- the data that constitutes a "bitcoin" unit of value. 
This is analogous to a geographic designation -- like Roquefort, or Champagne or Sonoma (a wine area). Product producers from those areas can stop others from applying the name as being "geographically misdescriptive." A consumer would be confused that the product is from the designated area, with those qualities. Particularly, an unsophisticated consumer who is targeted is likely to be confused. 
Designating a cryptocurrency with the designation of a confusingly similar well known cryptocurrency is similar to being "geographically misdescriptive." It is **"cryptographically misdescriptive."** 
The end result is the same:  Consumer confusion as to source. In this market, with sophisticated producers in an unregulated market, for a technically dense and new product, it is particularly egregious to target unsophisticated buyers, and there can be no doubt that it is with the intent to confuse.
Therefore, your honor, I'm shocked and outraged at this blatant attempt at **cryptographic misdescription** designed specifically to set a trap for unwary unsophisticated consumers. 
Just like labeling some delicious sparkling California wine as "Champagne," no matter how delicious the wine, it is not from the Champagne region of France, and this is geographically misdescriptive. Some may say the California sparkling wine is attempting to free ride off the reputation of the sparkling beverages from the Champagne region of France. To label sparkling wine from California as "Champagne" would be **geographically misdescriptive.**
Just like the California sparkling wines can stand alone, and may even be better than Champagnes, so it is with Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash may be valuable. It may have advantages. But it is not Bitcoin. Some may say that Bitcoin Cash is free riding off of the reputation of Bitcoin. And to label it "Bitcoin" is **cryptographically misdescriptive.**
And the proof is real. These plaintiffs have all come forward with declarations under oath that they have been so confused. All intended to purchase "bitcoin." All knew the risks involved with cryptocurrency value. They were not confused that they were purchasing a conservative store of value -- they knew cryptocurrency is a risky thing, and that they wanted the risk to be that of Bitcoin. That is the risk they were willing to take.
The risk they were unwilling to take is that they would be three-hand-montyed into purchasing something totally different -- bitcoin cash. They were confused that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, that BCH is BTC, that what is promoted on "bitcoin.com" is bitcoin. They were duped into purchasing bitcoin cash by intentionally confusing promotion. 
This is not to say that bitcoin cash is not equivalent to "champagne" or that it has no value. The true value of bitcoin cash is irrevelant. The only relevant point is that the purchasers did not get their bitcoin, they got something else.

The point is there are a number of tactics to defeat "brandjacking." 
Filing a domain squatting administrative action, seeking Twitter and other online identity terms of service enforcement, and whatever else is available. 
This could be "brandjacking" of the worst kind because it capitalizes on existing consumer confusion so that most younger, less financially savy folks spend their hard earned money investing in something that is possibly of substantially lower value than what they thought.

Tl;Dr: domain squatting and lack of consumer protection laws are an issue, plus I'm old and no one in  traditional financial management is available to help me navigate arouns the scams.
For the short term, two things:
(1) domain squatting, have ICANN at least consider if "Bitcoin.com" is free riding off the reputation of "Bitcoin" where the site is focused on Bitcoin cash; and,
(2) Regulate coins via consumer fraud laws.
 Have a "nutrition list" type requirement for all coins shown on regulated exchanges. Like orange soda -- it's orange in color only, maybe 1% orange juice and no vitamin c.
For coins, show how much "Bitcoin" is in them (sorry I'm not technical.) Or show how many forks away from some original block chain. 
And the number, the number mined, the half-ening dates, etc.
The point is that most consumers are going to go to a regulated exchange, at least for the short term. Have all coins traded, and derivatives, required to have this "nutrition label" . 
The regulatory agency could be the California state department that regulates consumer fraud. Or the Federal Trade Commission.
This is different from financial regulators, like the OCC, CFTC, SEC, etc. Those agencies want to know about *buyers.* The know your customer regulations are the thing. Who has money and where is it going.
This is a know-your-seller *customer protection*.  The idea is to get consumers protected.  Protect ordinary consumers from fraud. 
A complaint: I'm  older and female and am having a hard time navigating this.
 I have financial managers and estate planners, and a large social group, and no one takes this seriously.
 I've tried to find help to get more involved with crypto. I've been told that the wealth managers aren't allowed to recommend crypto as a fiduciary, and for estate planning it's just another asset and could be taxed or not. So even though I'd like to do some financial management with crypto, I don't have the confidence to know what's what. 
My adult child's significant other is a crypto trader, but this person seems focussed on Iota one week, and Vechain the next, because of the technology, not as a value proposition. 
So having this Bitcoin cash and other scamm-ish nonsense is a real barrier to entry, at least for me. 
If I go to Coinbase or Gdax, and see the crypto for sale, I'd like to see a disclosure of the coin/token/derivative sold, in an easy to read, standardized way. Like reading a nutrition label.
Ok kids off my lawn.

They were probably written last December.
