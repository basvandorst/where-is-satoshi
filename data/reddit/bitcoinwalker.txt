Why is it hard to comprehend that the value of Bitcoin is crashing? It's not about how to understand the random walks of its value, which can be a long discussion topic? Idiots often try to sound they are not idiotic.

The numbers speak for themselves. I report and you decide. Why do you advise me to quit?

I don't work for them so I cant elaborate more on this. But every merchant will surely keep a record on every single customer they deal with. This record works like a credit history score. Usually they will immediately impose some restrictions on your account if a negative thing happens. And then they will evaluate your account from time to time to see if they should lift those restrictions off depending on you and their policies.

My reddit account was shadowbanned by reporting that the value of Bitcoin is now $750 on BTC-E! :d

It seems people don't like to see the red down arrow next to the daily change number. Now on BTC-E it's just $850.

I just created some calculators that can convert Bitcoin to various currencies, including USD, EUR, and many others. Data feeds come from Coinbase, MtGox, Bitstamp, BTC-E, and BTCChina. With data from BTC-E, you can also use these calculators to convert Litecoin to BTC and USD. For Coinbase users I hope that they will find them handy as all fees are included in the final buy/sell amounts, and the calculators dynamically update themselves without you having to refresh your browser often! BitcoinWalker works best on desktops with latest Chrome. However, it's mobile friendly. Any comments/bug reports are welcome. Thank you!

Don't make a buy order unless you have enough funds to cover it in your account. If the ACH request of your order is bounced they will blacklist your account which will make it harder for your to do business with them in the future. Don't forget to check how much you would have to spend with

Why is it so hard to comprehend that the value just 'fluctuates a bit' buy dropping $-172.55 over just 10 hours?

My user page does not exist. Any comments will take a while to appear (maybe they get delayed for sometime by the censoring machine.

Having authentication code for making orders (buy/sell/send) will definitely add a new security layer for customers.

The Coinbase spot price on BitcoinWalker is $1024 now, an increase of nearly $200 in less than 10 hours.
