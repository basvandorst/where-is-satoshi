If he had real trading ability he'd be trading forex with freely available massive leverage and far more predictably. Crypto attracts people who don't have the ability to do that successfully.

Get out of the market for the time being, this downtrend shows no sign of stopping soon(from daily down to 2 hour charts/MACD), and Tether hasn't played out yet ...
