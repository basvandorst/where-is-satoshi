i garuntee you that the earliest purchase made with bitcoin was something done pretty secretively, and while the transaction might be on the blockchain we will never know which one it is. People used to just exchange bitcoin for money and things between eachother with no exchanges or marketplaces or anything. Thats probably when the first real purchase took place.
@_date: 2019-07-14 02:07:01
that wouldnt be a purchase tho

Also they cant easily seize bitcoin wallets. If your using an exchange sure, but theyd never be able to control bitcoin like you propose.

Don’t buy every 2 weeks you’ll kill yourself in exchange fees save the money up over time then when bitcoin dips buy big all at once as low as you can and keep it in 
@_date: 2018-06-11 10:10:28
Omg 15 free crypto currency how could I possibly resist 
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:12:50
That looks like he initiated the transfer via Coinbase then cancelled it before sending the funds to try and trick you I have no idea why it is the future lol
@_date: 2018-06-02 05:49:09
Ok well I’d still check the blockchain if it shows the funds arrived you know it’s on the receiving wallets end of it doesn’t you know it’s on the senders end 
@_date: 2018-06-01 07:33:04
Look on the block chain it probs just hasn’t processed yet 
@_date: 2019-02-05 12:09:51
i think its much more likely that the 2nd in command guy decided when the other dude died to just be like "oh no i dont know the password" and just take all the bitcoin for himself lmao
@_date: 2019-02-06 08:52:58
even if it is already in a wallet put it in another that they made themselves so only they could possibly know the private keys and store it somewhere off the internet

" Inflation is built into the code " can you read?
@_date: 2019-02-26 11:36:07
each block gives out rewards to miners in the form of new bitcoin only 21 million will ever exist but not all of it exists yet every 210,000 blocks as he said the block reward is halved since this is the supply of bitcoin increasing it is inflation as that is what inflation is.

dont sell until it goes back up you havent really lost money til you sell 
@_date: 2019-04-20 22:39:08
just for future reference dont tell people how much bitcoin you have dont tell them you have bitcoin phrasing this questions as "What are ways that Bitcoin can be secured?" gets the same answer without making you a possible target.
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:18:15
they only lost the money if they didnt sell when it hit 20k like a sane person and buy back in once it dropped lmao
@_date: 2019-01-05 07:43:55
you do what bitbilly on twitter says :p ok but did u see what that other guy said about percentage selling? thats the safest way to do it probably sell some at 10k some at 15 some at 20 everytime it might crash sell a bit right before then do the same thing in reverse going down 
@_date: 2019-01-02 14:15:37
they already dumped it lmao
@_date: 2019-01-04 12:17:11
he said before that its pgp encrypted he probably just copies the encrypted message and unencrypts it then deletes it once he is done
@_date: 2018-11-29 04:27:51
there are so many huge bitcoin adoptions happening in early 2019 anyone not buying rn is making a mistake

ya i usually do the same if i had a ton to play with id do more trading but i dont really have play money in large enough amounts for it to be worth doing as fuck ups on my part and fees would mean i barely made anything on a good day 
@_date: 2019-01-05 03:54:00
im not talking about doing the exact top and bottom just whenever it goes up a fuck ton really fast itll 90% of the time drop again and so you just sell and wait til its lower you dont have to buy the exact bottom to make a profit and trying to do so youll fuck yourself up
@_date: 2019-01-11 18:44:40
recurrent payments arent something you can do outside the wallet anyway. It'd require you to add that feature to a wallet and use that specific wallet you cant just have a website suck funds out of a normal bitcoin wallet, and recurrent payments through a website that creates its own in-built wallet (like exchanges) are going to be giving control to another entity to send your bitcoin not the best idea imo. As for one click content tiers. I dont really see the need for a centralized website here. Just have the tiers tied to your address. If its paid content you are logging in just include your wallets address in your account info on that persons site. once youve linked the wallet to your account you send the payment normally and they confirm you did it and upgrade your account into that tier. The way i see it this site would just be another trusted third party that takes control over your bitcoin away from you. I really dont understand the desire to centralize bitcoin usage when the whole point to begin with was to be decentralized. People are too eager to give up control for a little convenience.
@_date: 2019-01-11 18:26:01
thats the great thing about bitcoin we dont need a website to send it to each other you just post a receiving address like 1Fo13PTwJHHK8u2mFmqkP81b6t2Usw9ccL and boom people can send you bitcoin so if im a famous person all i gotta do is post my address and tell people "donate bitcoin here if u want"  and they can. Try it out. you can use the address i posted just now which is totally not mine and "test" this cool feature. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 12:18:28
i dont agree if he did it of his own free will its fine the issue is when other people force you to do it
@_date: 2019-01-05 07:38:20
well the balls part wasnt about the price its just about sticking to your guns and not screwing yourself on a trade and there are definitely ways to predict a market like when it went to almost 20k in a few weeks you know its gonna crash because thats a MASSIVE incentive for people to sell
@_date: 2019-01-11 14:17:40
this is actually a good thing for anyone who has usable bitcoin it means your coins are more valuable as the actual amount of total coins goes down  
@_date: 2019-01-07 15:50:01
ok but like the title is silly its been 2019 for 7 days so of course its the first fucking time in 2019 
@_date: 2019-01-05 03:28:57
its more about having balls of steel you have to be able to sell when its higher than its ever been and then not buy back in as it keeps going up wait until it falls and buy back in while its plummeting in the end you will have more bitcoin but itll be a wild ride to get there and most people chicken out and lose money 
@_date: 2019-01-05 09:59:31
thats why you dont sell everything on a whim you gotta hedge your bets 
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:57:42
its just 31 sataoshis 
@_date: 2019-05-10 05:59:26
Not to mention banning it wont even stop it. The only thing it would stop is the centralized exchanges local bitcoin fiat transactions could still happen easily to buy/sell and storing is even easier to do secretly. You can even bring it across borders with impunity. No amount of regulation can hold bitcoin down because its so versatile and powerful that aslong as people want to use it it will survive.
@_date: 2018-12-24 16:03:12
also id like to add the "extremely useful or important" bit is just the demand aspect of things so if something is extremely useful or important demand is high if there isnt supply to meet that demand it becomes very valuable because people are all wanting it and there isnt a lot to go around but if there is a metric fuck ton of it everywhere its not gonna matter how high demand is because supply will meet it
Edit: think about it this way if you had 1 lbs of gold today its valuable but if tomorrow we discovered we could imagine gold into existence you couldnt give that gold away if you tried 
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:20:52
nah he means a negative matter lambo its invisible you cant touch it and it repels you constantly

i think its stock market money since the markets are down rn
@_date: 2018-12-24 15:48:36
and golds use of being a store of value wouldn't be possible if it weren't worth lots of money in small quantities 
@_date: 2018-12-18 03:57:59
i agree with the post but careful about saying youve got so much bitcoin unless its air-gapped 
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:21:16
air gapped is when a device isnt networked in literally anyway yes this includes any connections to another device that is connected to the internet the best way to do it is to sign transactions with a wallet while offline and create and send those transactions with a watching wallet that isnt air gapped 
@_date: 2018-12-24 16:11:15
read the other thing i said the 2 definitions are both effected by supply 
@_date: 2018-12-24 15:59:10
yes as i explained having value and being valuable are not one and the same something has to have value to be valuable but something doesnt have to be valuable to have value items with a higher value are valuable and items which are more numerous have less value hence if gold were as common as dirt it wouldnt be valuable but it would still have some value as it could be used in computer parts and other tools or accessories

its all orders of magnitude going from earths energy to the suns energy is a gigantic leap as well but yes once a civilization has control over galactic levels of energy it would be insanely powerful to the point where the members of that civilization would be god-like from our perspective. A civilization like that could vaporize the earth in the blink of an eye with about as much difficulty as you or i might flick a light switch.

@_date: 2018-12-24 15:36:38
worth a great deal of money.
"a valuable antique"
Edit to elaborate: While the word value is the root word of Valuable it doesn't take its entire meaning from that word an item is Value-able because its something you can use to store large amounts of value gold works for this now because you can have a small amount of gold to store a large value hence it's valuable if gold were worth less and you had to store large amounts of it to store that same value it would no longer be considered valuable because it doesn't fulfill that purpose even tho it does still have some value.

ya as i said in the first reply number 2 was right you seemed to think the sun and solar system were 2 separate things but if you can control all of the energy from the sun you already control 99% of all energy in the solar system

Encrypt your seed phrase and write it to a CD (a flashdrive holds data for 20ish years while a CD holds it for 200) then hide the CD somewhere where itll be safe but hidden. Theyre so thin that you can stick them just about anywhere. Its also a good idea to have a few of these hidden in family members homes aswell or atleast in another building so a house fire cant destroy it. As long as you remember where it is; your private keys are safe and saved for the next 200 years.

" Gold is valuable because it doesnt change, make something from gold and that thing will last forever (at least a humans version of forever.) This is why we value gold, it does not tarnish, does not react, does not change. " Actually that is one thing that  makes gold useful the reason is valuable is because its so finite the same is true for bitcoin if there was a ton of gold everywhere it wouldnt be very valuable and if there were 1.2trillion bitcoin theyd be worth very little

Please sir tell me how you sign transactions with a pen and paper id love to know pen and paper ia fine for a private key it is not a functioning wallet
