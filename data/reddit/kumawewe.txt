This thought had crossed my mind, but surely the Auditors will point out just how much of this shite and been pushed in to BTC and will force them to pull it, hence causing the price to collapse.  I also think that Holders (as in most cases) won't even know whats happening until it does
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:48:15
So what you are saying is that they will take Real money to back up the fake money?  one of the main reasons Bitcoin was created was so that we could get away from this kind of activity. They need to let the Auditors in and accept the outcome

yes valid point

Can't really comment on your question but i can highly recommend the Ledger Blue. Great bit of kit!!

This was Bloomberg News, to be honest if you are using Bitstamp for example, you have to provide all your information anyway

Bravo!! Proper car!

There is of course the auction in Australia thats going to cause some jumping

Investing big money means you need a hardware wallet, secure your Private key!!!!!! Ledger have some great solutions, I use the Blue.

Is that for a single coffee??????

Wirex is pretty simple I looked at crypto.com and their fees are too much. Also as for Libra,??? They go against everything crypto related. BTC was created to take back the power to yourself, people have willing given all their photos and information to a splinter spy agency that now wants to control your Money???  No chance...
@_date: 2019-06-30 07:17:21
Let me just grab my Wirex card....

Steering wheel is on the wrong side
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:59:59
:-( I would have been too if I hadn't done something stupid like Panic during a sell off
@_date: 2017-04-29 05:19:18
Sounds very clear headed!!!! I sold all my BTC when I saw the Algo trading start earlier this year. If anyone things that the current movements are sustainable, they are delusional. There are bigger powers moving this now and when you see Buy Orders for $1 million you know it's over. The coin this was meant to represent is over. Greed has kicked in
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:32:07
My thoughts are that this is carefully orcastrated by some big institution's. Fidelity for one have been mining it... SIX Swiss Exchange goes live with their ETF / ETP tomorrow, BAKKT etc... Greedy bastards pushing the price down and using big Media to seek the idea of hashing warms and ICO's liquidating their cash to pay fines to the SEC. China were doing the same crap last year

Hats off to you Elon, Hats off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

First legal one ha ha
@_date: 2019-01-27 12:12:33
I know the people that built one for Stellar. I think the main issue is escrow, you need to have the BTC and The Cash on either side of the transactions
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:27:17
I thought Carney said Bitcoin had no value and you couldn't buy anything with it??
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:55:34
that opens a can of worms ha ha.  so Money that doesn't exist is being used to create something that doesn't have any backing so that you can buy Bitcoin which was designed to stop all this from every happening. hmmmm
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:26:14
Haaaaa haaaaaa!!
@_date: 2017-05-29 06:50:16
Correct, it takes your Private key and encrypts it in the device which is disconnected from the internet. I then watch value of BTC by importing the public key in to Mycelium phone wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:27:33
Ledger Blue Hardware wallet allows you do hold many coins on the one device. I have stored XRP, BTC, ETH, Litecoin, DASH. Fantastic device. Highly recommend

What an absolute stupid C**t
@_date: 2018-12-18 06:44:59
Great Post..

1st of July, bitcoin is adopted as a currency in Australia
