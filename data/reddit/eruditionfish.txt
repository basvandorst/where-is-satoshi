The author doesn't understand how bitcoin works. Simple as that.

Few, if any, advertising agencies are involved with selling the product they're advertising. OP's parody ad is still an ad for bitcoin.

It may be complicated, but so are all taxes.
In that particular example, you'd have "sold" bitcoin worth $180 to buy the AsicMiner, then earned an income of whatever the value of those 0.9BTC were at the time, and if you kept those bitcoin rather than cashing out immediately, you'd owe capital gains tax on the profit whenever you did cash out.
And if that's the total extent of your investment, you probably wouldn't meet the minimum thresholds at which tax would be payable.
@_date: 2014-06-18 08:32:04
All this is correct, except I think you mean "tax *evasion*". Tax avoidance (aka tax mitigation) is  the use of **legal** methods to reduce the amount of tax payable.

In most jurisdictions worldwide, the concept of legal tender only applies when you're settling a debt. If you're buying something from a store, you don't technically owe the store any money at the time you're trying to make a purchase, so in most jurisdictions, they are free to refuse any method of payment they want.
There will for example be lots of smaller stores that don't accept $100 bills (in Europe, €100, €200 and especially €500 bills are tricky to actually use), as the store may not carry enough change.

Ouch. He'll regret that.

My pleasure. And thanks for the tip (my first one).

Effectively yes. But if banks or other financial institutions were to adopt bitcoin as a way to transfer funds between themselves, as an alternative to current inter-bank systems, then that's in many ways what a USD bank account would be.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:24:41
Well, if the store prices their goods in both bitcoin and USD, then the "sale price" of your bitcoin would be equal to the USD price of the shirt, so that helps. If they don't, then the price can be sourced from an exchange.
@_date: 2015-01-18 18:11:13


But before 2014, the price was consistently higher at the end of the year than at the start, despite significant periods of decline. If the price should boost upwards again now, that pattern would be continuing (just not corresponding very well with the calendar year).
I'm not saying it's a great way to represent the data. But it's also one that is used elsewhere: I've often seen (and even published) historical interest rates represented as a year-on-year average.
@_date: 2015-09-27 08:14:08
I think that reaction was pretty accurate.
@_date: 2015-10-27 16:23:36
Slow but stable growth would be good. That keeps more people interested, which promotes adoption, but without the "it's a bubble" hype.
@_date: 2015-03-20 22:28:10


Isn't that exactly what OP is saying?
@_date: 2015-03-28 04:25:09
If they wanted to do that, wouldn't they just have replaced the packaging too, to avoid the broken seal?

While an image of a paper wallet might be easier to steal for someone accessing your files in person, wouldn't it be less likely to be found by malware or bot hacking looking for wallet data?
@_date: 2013-03-24 19:56:15
Thank you. That's pretty much exactly what I was saying. If I could go to an ATM and exchange bitcoin for cash, and then go to a post office or bank to pay my bills, then we'd only be a step away from me going to the post office and paying the bills directly in bitcoin.

I'm at 0.358. Originally had about 1, but I cashed some out on delicious chocolate after the April crash. The change is still worth more than what I had then :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:11:01
What I mean is that, at least back when GPU mining was viable, a lot of people were happy to spend more on their electricity bills than they made in mining, because they were expecting the value of bitcoin to rise. In those cases, they would have been better off spending that electricity bill money directly on bitcoin.
I don't know if that's still an issue with ASIC miners, though...
@_date: 2013-03-23 11:42:56
While easier access to Bitcoin certainly wouldn't be a bad thing, I think the real barrier to widespread adoption is a continuing lack of things you can do with them. Yes, there are a number of merchants, particularly online, that accept BTC, but if the average layman is unable to easily buy groceries and pay household bills with them, I find it unlikely that they would use Bitcoin for anything more than speculative investment.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:13:25
For any kind of transaction that is currently done electronically (card payments, direct debits, wire transfers, etc.) bitcoin could easily be used instead. 
The main difficulty would be in replacing cash as an instantaneous *offline* transfer of value. It would be possible to hand over a paper wallet (i.e. a piece of paper containing the private key to a bitcoin address) containing  an agreed-upon amount, but it would be difficult to verify the amount in that address without some sort of network connectivity.
There would likely still be a place for banks, as well. Online wallet services like BlockChain could take the place of card payment providers, or allow people who don't wish to go to the trouble of setting up a bitcoin client on their own computer. 
Mortgage, loan and investment brokers would also still be able to operate, but fractional reserve banking would become difficult, if not impossible.
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:41:11
Just keep in mind that if you end up mining at a loss now, while you might earn your money back as the price goes up, you would have been better off spending you money directly on buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:49:58
It really depends on how much he bought at each step. If each transaction was for a single bitcoin, then he spent $1150, and effectively added in another $100 (on top of the $850 he got back for selling it) to buy back at $950, for a total of $1250 spent on that bitcoin.
If the second purchase was made at the new price ($950), but with the same dollar amount he got back when selling, this changes the math. In this case, his original $1150 is all the dollars he ever spent, but he only has 0.895 BTC to show for it (for an overall $1285/BTC).

The QR code is a computer-readable version of the address private key. If you input that, or the actual private key into a wallet software or bitcoin client, you will have full access to the address again.
@_date: 2013-03-24 19:47:36
I never said that bitcoin is worthless, or a bad investment. All I said is that I don't see bitcoin becoming widely adopted as a form of payment unless it becomes easier to buy everyday goods with it. Just like gold is not a common method of payment.

I completely agree with you. Using bitcoin is essentially very similar to using Euro while living in the UK, or owning GBP while living in the US. 
On the other hand, that's part of the problem. If I have a large amount of money in a Euro bank account, or a large stack of US banknotes under the bed, that's not particularly useful for paying rent or utilities in the UK. Having more shops accept bitcoin directly, or more local or automated bitcoin exchanges would help a lot towards widespread adoption, though.

What if "it was an impulse buy" is followed up with "and now four months later, I was able to buy both a new TV and a takeaway pizza to celebrate it"?

You can either sell bitcoin directly to other people (for example at LocalBitCoins) or to other people via an exchange. Alternatively, you can spend it as currency for goods or services, or hold onto it as an investment.

I never quite understood why gold enthusiasts believe that gold has so much "intrinsic value" that fiat currency doesn't. If it wasn't for the fact that gold is shiny and we like shiny things, it would have a similar value to tungsten, copper, etc. Until electricity was discovered, it had basically zero value as a commodity apart from us liking it.
@_date: 2013-03-24 20:09:04
That's exactly what I was thinking when I saw it: You could use Bridgewalker to pass money between it and a regular bitcoin wallet in order to take advantage of fluctuation in the exchange rate all by yourself, and without having to deal with the regular fees related to fiat transactions.

regardless of your definition of "few", "Few grand every few days" does imply approximately $1000 per day. Math :-)

On the other hand, if you start on a given day and save the money you would have used to buy until you have saved a week's worth and buy on day 7, you lose compared to spreading it out.
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:10:21
If the weekly buy is 7x the daily buy *in dollars*, and the price keeps going up, then BalconySitter is correct.
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:09:18
You're right. I forgot to take the long term into account.
I guess in the end, the best strategy (assuming the price rises fairly steadily) is to buy when you can (weekly if you get paid weekly, monthly if you get paid monthly).
 ^(No need for the profanity, though.)
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:13:14
The concept of [green addresses]( was invented to try to address that exact issue. In essence, it allows recipients to assume that transfers from trusted addresses are good, and to treat them as confirmed instantaneously, without waiting for confirmation from the blockchain. MtGox, for example, has a green address that its customers can transfer money through.
In the case of day-to-day purchases, you can also (with some good-will) rely on good old-fashioned trust. If you can show that you have enough bitcoin to cover the sandwich (for example with your smartphone), and I see you put the transfer through, it seems fair to assume that the transfer is good.

I haven't gotten rich, but the tiny amount I invested in bitcoin became two boxes of fancy chocolates earlier this year, and the change left over is now worth about $100. I'm pretty happy.
