So the SEC would allow investors to be at the mercy of unqualified individuals, when even experts in the field cant be sure of what decisions to make.

Experts dont agree as to what will happen after a hardfork, or what will be the "real" bitcoin if both sides survive (they have different interpretations and views, even if satoshi was around today some would even disagree with him). 


Ill try and define qualified, I mean recognized professional developers within the bitcoin community. They may be professionals, but without consensus others may disagree with them,  so their opinions are of limited usefulness and value until such time that agreements can be reached among all or basically all of them (the community will likely follow if there is unanimous agreement).


Yes they would not allow stupid rules that make no sense and put investors assets in peril. Common sense...


Allowing the twins to make final decisions, in an event where they can really screw it up and choose the wrong chain for example, since it may remain unclear which side will eventually take over, or maybe both will continue, yet if they only keep coins from one side of the fork, or allow deposits from one side of the fork and then mix everything together, it can get messy, in the event that the chain they select goes bust, or loses all its value. 
Professional developers within the bitcoin community should have this role, and even they might get it wrong. to allow some random plebs such discretion makes no sense.


You cant hard fork gold or oil. this is a new concept. even professional developers cant agree on what will or should happen, so you can be sure that no one can predict the future in this regard. Therefore this issue is completely uncertain. 
The SEC has an obligation to acknowledge this uncertainty and rule that they should wait until after a future hard fork that will hopefully remove these issues, at which point they may reconsider an ETF.

I am not convinced that this will be enough, eg if it was 25% vs 75%, if both sides have enough firepower to keep going, the 25% might actually win longer term if people like their product. 
Developer majority is only really clear if it was like 99% vs 1% where you can claim that the 1% is just a few fanatics, they have no support, wont have enough miners and their devs wont be able to keep up with maintaining the software/code. 
In bitcoin the Devs are like leaders, however the community has to be convinced to actually follow them. The minimum is enough users to support paying the miners and enough Devs to maintain the code. once a community has that threshold , it may actually win long term, despite initially less users.
The only surefire way not to go wrong, is to wait and see. predicting the future is actually impossible in regards to this new technology, which is actually an experiment after all.

probably standard procedures, but why ruin your moment.
As far as I can see the SEC gives no shits about these kind of details. If they allow or decline an ETF it has nothing to do with electronic trading firms.

dude take a look at eth and ethc, now try and imagine regulators scratching their heads and trying to figure out wtf to do. FFS even coinbase suffered from replay attacks. 
They dont want to be responsible for risky shit. They would rather wait until after whatever scaling and hard fork occurs and then reconsider an ETF that will be relatively stable.


again go study eth and ethc. its way more complicated. also what if its 50% value in each fork. then what?
@_date: 2017-02-09 05:07:06
The bitcoin hard fork clause is highly controversial. Dont expect to SEC to make decisions on this subject when even top developers within the bitcoin industry cant come to consensus. 
I think the SEC has no choice but to wait and see what happens with bitcoin and scaling/hard forking before they can approve any ETF. Otherwise its setting investors up to lose their money in the case of a split.

That is a terrible idea. Yes it will lead to a decision, but it might be a stupid one that eventually will make every investor lose everything, if what was thought to be the losing end, continues and eventually wins. Or if both forks have 50/50 value/hash, a week after their decision to drop one side of the fork, and sell what they thought was the losing side, well below value. 
The thing is, there is no measure, to predict at this point, what will win long term. we have to simply wait and see.
@_date: 2017-02-09 11:03:32


I dont think there is an alternative, we have to simply wait and see. Nobody knows the future due to the experimental nature of bitcoin. It could hard fork 20x and all 20 might survive. sounds weird, but it could happen, meanwhile the winklevoss ETF will have one random chain, that their rules told them to hold. 


great, well no one else is qualified to comment, as mentioned even the devs are only useful if basically 100% of them agree on things.


Well I have to disagree, we can be certain that the community is **currently** divided and have opposing views of what will happen in the future. Due to the experimental nature of bitcoin we dont have any precedent to go off for what may happen, therefore right now we have a very unique "wait and see" event. In the future this may all be solved and cleared away, at which point it will be easier to define what may happen (based on this precedant) and to plan appropriately.   
@_date: 2017-02-09 01:08:24

it would be super ironic if eth actually ends up becoming the minority chain and ethc takes over. 
Also it took time for the market to try and price in ethc, so if they dumped their "ethc" too soon they wouldnt get a fair price for it. 
Lastly it might be a 50/50 scenario. they choose one and their investors lose 50% of their assets. great. The SEC should totally be down with that.
A major issue is the discretion involved. do you think the winklevoss twins are qualified to make such decisions when professional developers and miners cant agree on these things? Makes no sense.

I was not thinking of the delay. more that at decision time, they had better make sure to consult actual bitcoin developers and professional witnesses/consultants. 
The thing is if they do proper research they will receive opposite and conflicting opinions, of which there is no clear wrong or right answer. So they will be forced to take a third option of "wait and see" what happens after a future hard fork.

Keep bitcoins in an address that has never yet spent any coins (no outgoing transactions) and the bitcoins will be quantum computer proof. 
One day if quantum computers ever come out, they will just issue a patch to allow you to spend your coins without exposing them to quantum computers. Or better yet, if we ever catch wind that any progress in quantum research is afoot, steps will be taken well in advance, to keep the bitcoin network well adapted to progressive technological breakthroughs.

he borrowed someone elses bitcoins and then sold them at $1080 , now he was forced to buy back at $1200 in order to return the borrowed bitcoins. 
So they lost $120 per coin x 8400 coins = $1,000,000 loss if they used 10x leverage, 500K loss if they used 20x leverage and had sold at $1140. If they used less leverage, then the losses were much much greater.

A bunch of people leveraged their houses to buy bitcoins thus pumping the price too quickly. Once they were done the price corrected. Many of these people were margin called due to the high leverage they were using, thus pushing the price  further than it should have gone. Also since many newbies had bought in, they also panic sold at the bottom. 
Now that they are done selling, the price will now recover and slowly go back up, unless more guys turn up, and buy the price up too quickly again by leveraging their houses, in which case the cycle will repeat.

Great explanation, however this is the only part that is incorrect.
 It was a position worth $10 million dollars, however the losses were much less than that. 
If the position was bought on 20x leverage then the loss was 5% (basically to open on 20x you only need to have 5% of the position size in your balance on the exchange) of that so the loss would be $500k.
If they used 10x leverage then the loss was 10% so $1 million. If they used less leverage, then the losses were even greater (to lose $10 million for this position of 8300 BTC they would have needed to short at $.01 which was impossible).
The maximum they could have possibly lost, would be if they shorted when quarterly opened at ~$850, so 8300 BTC x $350 loss per coin is ~$3 million dollars.

It is not freely traded. The rates are set each day and China uses their foreign currency reserves to push the price to wherever they like during trading hours as well.
Chinese people arent stupid enough to fall for these petty tricks. They know that over time the foreign currency reserves will run out , and so either the Chinese government will voluntarily devalue the currency slowly over time, or it will completely crash when the reserves run out (much worse case scenario). 
Any Chinese people hoarding Yuan in their savings accounts will lose much of their wealth if they dont act soon.

No do not ever spend even once. You can deposit, but do not spend at all, and the coins will be quantum proof, since quantum computers dont have a significant advantage for decrypting unspent bitcoin addresses (while the actual public key is still unknown). This is because the public address is not your actual public key. So until you spend your bitcoins, the public key is actually still unknown.
One day if quantum computers ever come out, they will just issue a patch to allow you to spend your coins without exposing them to quantum computer attacks. Or better yet, if we ever catch wind that any progress in quantum research is afoot, steps will be taken well in advance, to keep the bitcoin network well adapted to progressive technological breakthroughs.

Too many people were over-leveraged and it only took a small amount of dumping to cause cascading margin calls. 
The price then over-corrected to the downside. Now it is recovering. Hopefully this time with less heavily leveraged traders so that we wont get a repeat. 
A "Buy the dip" strategy would have been the perfect play for the recent market movement. Meanwhile newbies panicked and market sold/shorted the bottom.

If you take some cash and buy bitcoins then there is nothing to know about or find. There is no record of those coins , so its as if they dont exist. Therefore they wont question you or even know that there is something to seize.


This is something else, sounds like you are claiming that even if you have anonymous coins, you wont be able to spend them?

You keep referencing that they will look at your accounts etc. but they **will not** find anything in their audits because **the blockchain balance is not listed anywhere**, not in your bank account, employment history or current income. So this is a non issue. 
Let them audit you 100x, **they wont find jack shit**. You have to understand that **bitcoin is not part of the legacy system**, it is completely separate, so all their checks wont find anything at all. Bitcoin is like burying a gold bar you found, in a secret place, they can check in their computers all they like but it wont have any record of this...


This does sound worrying if your claim is true. I guess you wont be able to spend your bitcoin on big ticket things.


Completely false. Bitcoin is like cash, just swap it for cash and there wont be any record of your purchases if you dont choose to ever hand over your information. Or spend it in a store that accepts bitcoin, you will buy stuff without presenting your ID, so no one knows anything.
You seem to be saying that you cant buy things online without having some sort of record since there is a delivery address. Well if this is an issue then only buy things in person using your bitcoin and without providing your ID.


I agree that using the current system they have your full fucking life on their computers. However bitcoin might soon become more anonymous (fungible) than it currently is, which will finally be able to get the IRS to fuck off once and for all. For now what you can do is only purchase bitcoins with cash and no ID and you should be fine.

get a hardware wallet. You should read up about that. also you can use multiple hardware wallets to create a multisig address. then store the multiple hardware wallets in different locations.


Official companies will honor their warranties regardless of the payment method. They dont want to screw you and then have the internet blow up about it thus ruining their entire business reputation. If you are genuinely worried about this then use a freaking credit card. Bitcoin has a niche use, and that is as wealth storage. If you want the ability to chargeback and such then obviously bitcoin isnt for you.

they cracked down on capital outflows, so their yuan has no sell pressure to push it down. All outflows are now putting pressure on bitcoin instead, so the price is rising.
Meanwhile the price on western exchanges has heavy sell pressure since the chinese are selling the bitcoins they bought with CNY for USD. So western exchanges are lagging behind by $100-$160 per BTC.

@_date: 2017-01-05 00:36:34


well that is 1 consideration, usually you just pay interest so you can basically borrow indefintiely. 
The Key is actually the max loss you can take before the exchange takes control and forcibly closes your position (ie buys back the bitcoins you had sold and then returns the coins to the lender). This is called a "margin call". Once your losses get close to your balance the exchange closes your position, and this is what occurred in this case.

Interesting marketing idea.




Whereas from ¥6 to ¥8 is a lot more acceptable. 
If they actually do it, I would think that people will want more of these little pieces, rather than having ridiculous amounts of bitcoin displayed in decimal points, they will have a sense of achievement (it will fuck with peoples minds and make them buy/want more). Also people wont mind paying more, after all $1 for a mBTC doesnt seem like much at all, hell $2 isnt much either, if it hits $10, it will be less mind blowing to accept that price than $10,000 per full bitcoin.

Basically those other coins just cloned the bitcoin code whilst adding no significant improvement. 
People are like "wow so cheap" so they buy and pump it, but it has no real use since everyone knows that bitcoin was the original coin. Also bitcoin has the most users, developers and acceptance for trading/bartering/purchasing. The others are just pump n dumps.

Low liquidity.
 Buyers have to space their buys out over time, or the price rises too quickly and the slippage becomes too great.
To avoid these issues, a decent strategy for buyers is to use bitcoin futures exchanges to hedge large buy positions , then slowly deleverage as they purchase real bitcoins on regular exchanges. The futures hedged buy will counteract slippage as the price rises on regular exchanges.

409 BTC x 8100-CNY = 3,312,900 CNY

Bitcoin exchanges dont usually allow your account have a negative balance. They usually liquidate the position and if they dont manage to do so, they spread the losses onto all other users with winning positions.

Yes they are quantum proof now.
Once the coins were sent from Address A to address B and there were multiple confirmations on the blockchain, then that is set in stone. Address A becomes irrelevant as the Coins now belong entirely to address B.

Government regulation is the only current realistic way to prevent active exchanges from suffering a repeat of MT-Gox. 
This is terrific news. Bitcoin will become more mainstream and less "wild west". 
Increasing the amount of fully regulated exchanges and the Bitcoin ETF getting approved, will do wonders for adoption. 2017 will become the greatest year of mainstream growth to date. 
For those on the fringes who dont like regulation, well you guys can feel free to use BTC-e or shapeshift.
@_date: 2017-01-04 09:48:23
for now the main use case for bitcoin is as Digital Gold, for countries where the governments are persecuting their citizens and hyper-inflating their local currencies. 
In time as technology gets better bitcoin will become more efficient for micro-tipping as well.

thanks, although we want to use an SSD (looks like the SSD will cost more than everything else combined :D). Do you think that a celeron processor is enough longterm? might it be worth buying an i3 or i5? 
Also we want to run ubuntu and bitcore. maybe that is heavier than what you did?

just buy from trustworthy companies. You can complain to various legal entities if they fail to deliver the services/goods, or you can post the evidence online and warn others. Legitimate and regulated companies wont ruin their businesses for some small transaction.
Or just use a respected escrow service.

some people have corrupt governments raiding their homes and stealing their shit. They would rather hold an asset that is volatile than **for sure lose** whatever they held previously.
@_date: 2016-12-31 15:46:07
Homes in India are getting raided and gold is being seized. Not everyone has connections overseas, nor can many easily smuggle their wealth outside the countries borders. Not to mention the excessive costs that overseas asset storage will cost. 
Bitcoin is an alternative option, its easy, secure and requires no upkeep, so many regular folk are trying it out.
This is an experiment, but the world is so crazy at the moment (as in unstable and in turmoil) it just might work.
