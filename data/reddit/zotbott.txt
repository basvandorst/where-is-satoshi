And maybe because Mt Gox owes the users the value of their Btc at time of the  theft or bankruptcy.

Coinbase may still work in WA.  A lot of Credit card companies will deny the charge initially, so you have to call and have them on the line when making  the  purchase.  Libertx is good if you have cash in Seattle, only 4%fee

Bitpay has a debit card and app to manage Balances.  Send Btc to your bitpay address, card is loaded with usd almost instantly.

Yes, when you are long 300mil in Btc futures.��

Rough crowd.  I am curious about the future of these btc owned by satoshi.  I personally believe most of these BTC will be given away to raise awareness and increase adoption.

 At least they are diversified into SPANK coin!

You should, Sell your $150 of Btc 
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:25:25
No taxable event if you did not sell
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:52:45
Send it back to address you received it from.   It's not yours.  Basically you found $20,000, you know who it belongs too and are choosing to keep it.  It could be some newbie just like you who fucked up and made a mistake.  Why not do the right thing and give them their money back.

Think how many Btc will have been lost forever in 100 years.  I bet 40%. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 00:30:32
