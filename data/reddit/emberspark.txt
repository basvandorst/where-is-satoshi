You're going to lose your sister if you cheat her like you're trying to do. You promised her $375,000 and now you want her to settle for not only going into debt, but receiving $300k less than she originally would have because *you* took it upon yourself to invest *her* money before talking to *her* about it, and then *lied to her* about profitability. It would be one thing if she told you to invest her half of the money before you did it - then it would be an equal mistake. But you invested her money without her knowledge, only telling her about it after the fact, and now you're trying to turn it around so you still get half of the remaining money. It's bullshit, and if my brother tried to cheat me out of money he owed me, I wouldn't talk to him anymore. Be a man, own up to your mistakes, and give her whatever money is left over.

For the record, do not invest any more money into it, and if you only end with the $280,000 left, give it to your sister. You gambled away your half and a good chunk of hers - you don't deserve any of the money that's left over.

You invested *before* she agreed to it. She didn't have a choice but to agree with you. She also probably didn't know just how much you invested, because any idiot with a brain would tell you that putting almost all of your inheritance into an unstable market like Bitcoin is an idiotic idea, and if she's going into a STEM field then I don't think she's that stupid. She deserves 100% of any money left over, and you don't deserve a thing.
