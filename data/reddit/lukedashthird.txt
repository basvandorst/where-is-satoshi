lol, you're an awful person
@_date: 2015-09-29 17:13:54
Actually that's the current market equilibrium value. There's no reason to assume it'll go down.
@_date: 2015-09-17 20:04:25
Bitcoin, racism and historical ignorance, truly a match made in heaven.

I can't wait until Qualcomm finds out this is all 21inc can deliver :D
@_date: 2015-09-14 12:28:01


Lol, that's probably like 2 times the order book depth on all the exchanges together.
@_date: 2015-09-24 13:22:17
god bles

I'll get back to you when it happens.

Lol, looks like is degenerating into a mutual support group for feckless libertarians again.
@_date: 2015-09-20 11:49:19
Lol if you think most mixing services haven't been compromised already. IRS probably has all their logs.

Bitcoin is entirely unsuitable for micropayments, so their marketplace will be 100% centralized.
@_date: 2015-09-29 17:09:42
And faster, and more effective. Patent nonsense does not deserve a serious rebuttal.
@_date: 2015-09-12 22:16:12
And by "we" you mean "somebody else", right?
@_date: 2015-09-13 19:30:36
That's nothing, I've walked across countless borders with thousands of coins in my bank account, did not even require a briefcase.
@_date: 2015-09-30 20:01:28
No, it's people who say meaningless things like "Properly secured bitcoin cannot be lost" who suck. "Oh, you lost all your bitcoin? I guess you didn't secure it ~properly~ by following my easy 217-item checklist!"
@_date: 2015-09-30 19:39:20
Is there some reason to assume there will be more competition? Bitcoin ATMs in Ukraine are a tiny economical niche, perhaps a 18% spread is the best anybody can do.
@_date: 2015-09-22 10:52:49
in which case the shitty mining functionality makes even less sense.
@_date: 2015-09-30 19:57:23
If you knew history you'd find that anarchism has since its beginning been a left-wing ideology, close to the socialist and communist movements in the 1800s.
Murray Rothbard was the one who thought his particular brand of petty selfish liberalism needed rebranding, and coined the term "anarcho-capitalism" around 1950.

Gains don't exist until you've sold. You have sold, haven't you? If you haven't, you should.
@_date: 2015-11-01 19:19:31
I think you take this stuff too seriously.

the greatest sin
@_date: 2015-10-25 19:40:20


Lol, clearly neither you nor your "friend" know anything about economics.
@_date: 2015-10-07 21:11:20
Well that's okay then, no big deal.
@_date: 2015-10-06 22:32:46
A one-to-one association between a transaction ID and the transaction itself? Inconceivable!
@_date: 2015-10-25 19:53:34
You must be on a meshnet.
@_date: 2015-10-25 20:12:31
And all those people will lose their money.
@_date: 2015-10-18 14:01:11
This is what any reasonable non-charity business would do. They will only lower their prices if they have to, in order to meet competitors' prices. Since their semi-centralized distributed database does not require mining, they will be able to undercut bitcoin's fees if they really want to.

Bbbbut Andreas Antonopoulos told me that unlike bitcoin water has no intrinsic value!

Also unable to buy anything except drugs and fake hits.

As if any reputable zoo would allow you to abuse their animals just to advertise bit-coins.

Less than a year.

Hey, that's not an economist, it's just a crudely constructed straw dummy!

If you have to pay a fee to withdraw cash from an ATM you are doing something terribly wrong.
@_date: 2015-10-29 00:03:17
Blockchain is simply the buzzword of the day, it does not mean anything here. The banks are applying conventional distributed databases with cryptographic signatures to niche use cases like trading private securities.
@_date: 2015-10-23 20:55:10
Penguins and monkeys cannot be found in reputable petting zoos because they are undomesticated animals with very specific diets. So yeah, having a bitcoin-operated banana dispenser for monkeys would be animal abuse.

Which don't exist yet, but that's just a minor detail. It's all in the wiki, that is what matters.

Cool! What's your favourite drug recipe in the Anarchist Cookbook, jenkem or bananadine?
@_date: 2015-10-26 14:05:52
None of this will happen. There will be no "wealth transfer tsunami", that's just a get-rich-quick fantasy endemic among bitcoiners. It's fairly likely that *you* are one of those laymen who will lose their money.

I thought you lived in St. Kitts?
@_date: 2015-10-31 11:27:13
I don't deal in illegal stuff or try to scam people, so this has never been an issue.
@_date: 2015-10-23 23:28:44
A cure for weak hands.
@_date: 2015-10-22 13:09:01


No, no it would not.

Economist writers are not what you'd normally call nontechnical people.
@_date: 2015-10-31 12:42:12
I know this can be a hard concept for some, but a lot of people manage to live their lives without dealing drugs or participating in credit card fraud.
