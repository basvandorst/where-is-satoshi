that would be a great idea for a youtube video/compilation of making fun of people doubting bitcoin in the past at all prices that it was before

i'll bet all my bitcoins that the price will go below what it is currently, some time in the future

How do you route transactions through the node? Does that make transactions free?

whatever's on coinbase

And just until a couple of days ago, Bitcoin was around the popularity of Clash of Clans 
But if we compare bitcoins search volume to a term like Canada, Bitcoin still looks small

A really fascinating comparison is Bitcoin vs Pokémon GO search volume, since they are close in search popularity:

Do you recognize this is an echo chamber?

Why hasn't anyone been able to reverse engineer the key generation process to generate a private key address that they know has a balance? I just can't believe that Bitcoin is open source but was able to make the key generation process irreversible &amp; fully functional offline!

Well what are the numbers? What are the chances of generating an existing wallet that contains more than 0 bitcoins? And how many bitcoin addresses can a quantum computer the size of a solar system generate per second?

How does Bitcoin prevent someone modifying the address generation code to pick a specific address to generate a private key for?

If wallets can be generated offline, how does Bitcoin make it impossible to generate a custom address that already exists? I am fascinated with the fact that it's open source, can generate addresses that automatically work offline, but was able to make it impossible to steal existing custom addresses!
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:06:20
How is the system able to prevent picking a specific one then (like an address that you know already contains a balance)?
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:05:13
How is it able to make the key generation process irreversible? How is backwards generating private keys for targeted addresses prevented?

What if miners spent as much energy generating addresses and private keys as they do mining coins? My Macbook can generate like 100,000 Bitcoin addresses &amp; keys a second, but the chances of getting a dup are far too low, and the chances of the dup wallet being empty are extremely high. Perhaps creating an ASIC just for creating addresses, and then have a script constantly checking the balances of any generated addresses &amp; empty it out if it's more than 0?
