No dispersants were sprayed, the most we got were nets around the bay.

The spill barely touched this part of the gulf coast. The only thing that spill did was make BP payout a very nice chunk of money to the tourist dependent business and oystermen in that area. (Though, they didn't need it, and now those who got money are now getting into some deep shit.)

Well, as a local to that area, you have him and Kid Rock who live in the plantation. I think a few other notable celebrities visit once and a while. Helps that there's a private airport in the plantation..

I can't drink (legally), But I'll be happy to have some cigars and talk cryptocurrency if we are there at the same time (Away at college at the moment.)

Its cool :) I'm just getting into bitcoin actually.
My sister normally buys alcohol for me. Honestly the fact that I'm doing something illegal makes my angry orchard taste just a little bit better.

Lol. I don't live in the plantation, I used to fix the air conditioners in the plantation.

Key notes about the area. (I find this cool because this is in the last place I would expect to see bitcoins being used.)
Plantation is a very VERY nice gated community, 
St George is one of the most secluded beaches, so less douchebags and screaming kids. 
Great food, BJ's for pizza, Blue Parrot for tiki bar, Harry A's for live entertainment, Owl Cafe, and Caroline's (Both on the mainland) for fancy food, and Boss Oyster and Papa Joe's for seafood and oysters.
Little traffic: This area is about 2 hours from the nearest city.
Great fishing and hunting: (can't hunt on the island, but you can on the mainland)
The only downsides are..
Rednecks, lots of rednecks in that area, some are the nicest people, some are complete pricks
Water quality. DO NOT DRINK TAP WATER OR HOSE WATER FROM THE ISLAND! you're better off drinking the water from Mexico.
Humidity: Not that its bad, but it comes with the territory.
SGI is a barrier island, so when hurricanes come, and they do come, it is evacuated and the bridge is closed, and it is hit hard (luckily most of the buildings are up to code..... most.)
Poor education system: take it from someone who was raised here, the school sucks, one of the worst in the state. (Like you are going to be using the house as anything but a vacation home anyway...)
Bugs: Again, they come with the territory, bounce sheets will solve the problem though and are only a problem in the med to late summer.
