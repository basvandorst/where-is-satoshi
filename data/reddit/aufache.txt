I heard there are btc machines that take cash. Maybe you can google one near you?? But i think if youre using an exchange for altcoins and such thats where it gets tricky.

I agree with the consensus since its a fact there are more men than women currently in crypto. However there is a general gender inequality in crypto and blockchain with a bias towards men. I as a millenial woman didnt even think of such an issue till i experienced the inequality issue at a crypto conference with other mainly millennial men. I wasnt treated the same and there was only one female speaker amongst the many male speakers. Many of the men in the audience immediately didnt take her seriously and the mood changed since she was a woman. I was also kicked out of the conference i was given permission in advance to photograph with no explanation as to why i was kicked out(professional photographer). Lots of women are standing up about similar experiences though "the blockchain bros."
So to understand why there might be a focus on the inequality of investors in crypto is understandable. But the facts are that right now there are more men invested than women. That doesnt make it unjust. At the same time we must realize that many women aren't being treated fairly in this kind of sphere and that is what i consider unjust.

True its foolish. Im kinda a hypocrite though.. I'm tempted to wear crypto apparel and do OOTDs and post it online, but it's not worth my safety on and offline. God the last thing I want is someone kidnapping me, stealing me money, or putting me in a life threatening position everyday of my life.....  i don't even want to write a blog about investing in cryptocurrency.. probably ever... welp. You can never go back once you advertise yourself ��.

Yup this has been a common thread. With fingerprints and stuff from amazon. I decided to buy directly from ledger and wait a few weeks/months till they restocked their wallet. It avoids the trouble. Can't trust most anyone except the source ��. I guess you choose your risk... time waiting for a ledger from the source and having coins stolen on an exchange while you wait OR buying a tempered with ledger and losing all your money.
Like others mention.. there might be a reset option on the ledger. Im not sure.
