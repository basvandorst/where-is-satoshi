Well, what's happening is, we are seeing Bitcoin now adding more liquidity to the market. Future's contacts are trading in the 100s of millions of dollars. This was only a hope back in 2013 when I entered this space. It became almost a reality in 2015 with the Winklvoss  Bros. filing for ETF. But, quickly dimmed by Lawsky drawing up the bit-license. For those just getting started I know how you feel. And. I know the power of HODL. It smells green. My advice. HODL. BTC, BTH, ETH, LTC, IOTA, XRP and Monero.

BTC is proven to be resilient. It has weathered the storm and is now being traded on the futures market. Who thinks it's going to suddenly go backwards? I think it's going to continue doing what it does. Make believers outta people. In 2018 Bitcoin will surpass 500 billion market cap by itself. Putting each coin over double what it is today.

I don't look at that anyways. I post what I like. I share what I like. I like it! And to me that's what matters. Also, 1.2 million didn't see my post. Just a fraction of that seen it. Trust! Peace to you. Worship One God, do good deeds, and avoid the bad deeds as much as you can. You will have a happy successful life in this life and in the next two lives i.e. life of the grave and life of Judgement Day. Best advice.

I know what Bitcoin is. I know what it's for, who it benefits, a person is their own banker when they use Bitcoin. My heading is fine. It's just a play on words. I only have an entire corporation in this space. And are launching an incredible product utilizing the Ethereum blockchain soon!

I don't like when people take time out to say ohhh your post is crap. I post positive stuff, nothing on my profile is negative except for these occasional dudes who are just so negative it's disgusting. Just, move on if you don't like someones post. It's a post about Bitcoin. I liked it. So, I shared it on Reddit, I mean my God, wth! Are you guys even human???
@_date: 2019-11-02 22:05:10
You're a speckle. I posted it. It'll benefit who it benefits and my post will apparently cause others like you to have an extremely bad day. Sorry your life is such. You could find something else pleasant to do.

That makes my analogy correct then because the Taxi service offered meager service. They controlled the market, so they oftentimes didn't care if they were late or on time for customer pick up and drop off. Taxi hate Uber and Lyft because they do for the people better and more efficient, securely than what they did. Notice, Taxi don't support Uber or Lyft for those reasons alone.
Now, we compare that with Bitcoin. Now that Bitcoin is on the horizon it allows for all the things we as customers needed that banks took for granted. As access to our money 24/7, the ability to travel anywhere in the world without getting funds frozen for pretty reasons as with cashier checks, Bitcoin is International like the internet, so we can transact with someone in the backwoods of Venezuela or Kenya, any time of the day without fear of being censored, or stopped. Must I go on?
So Bitcoin is to banks what Uber and Lyft are to Taxi.
A Better Version Than They...

I know plus let's talk about all those roaches on the floor.... Point of this article is if such a large amount of money can be moved with low fees of 0.10 cents then fees will be low for mass adoption. There's a bigger picture. Those who experienced high fees earlier this year see the relevance in this post. This is the kind of news that will cause prices to go up again because people can use bitcoin for what it was created for. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 22:35:49
Yes, and I dislike the fact that miners can pick which transactions they want from the Bitcoin memepool to the end that many in there get delayed awhile. It should be fair that first come first serve. I promise you this issue will be fixed but for now we see devs are running day and night trying to fix Bitcoin slow speeds and high fees issues. It's close to being resolved.

When you say HODL, what does that mean. Does it mean just watch it go up forever, then pass away with it up. Or, I mean, everyone has a number at which they'll either cashout or began to spend from it. 
HODL lost its meaning in these new crypto enthusiasts.

Yes, because IRS executes whatever they can to get tax money. I don't like it. But, guess they don't care that by doing this it makes Bitcoin a legit money. They helped in way more than anything. We have to pay taxes, but not as a property gains tax. Anyway..

Wait... Selling, price goes down. Buying, price goes up. 
I like you're statement about value not being a zero sum game. Value of life is subjective to each individual person. 
Value of coin is subjective to the actions of many persons. For example, if people stop believing a currency is worth a certain amount it drops in value. That's exactly what people are saying in way when they cash out of Bitcoin. They believe they'll get more value going the other way, the way of cash, than with that cryptocurrency. 
But, life will go on with a bunch value in it. Lol

Very very very very very very very very very VERY Good Point. Thanks. I literally never thought about that. Wow!

This is true in many cases. The cashing out by retailers that accept Bitcoin has to stop as well. This is why the price is steady low, many retailers see it a good idea to accept cryptocurrency but they cash it right in via Bitpay or another payment processor. They don't really believe in the tech of cryptocurrency yet. Retailers need wholesalers to accept cryptocurrency as well. Otherwise, they don't have a way to recoup inventory. This is why there needs to be a cryptocurrency ecosystem where the money stays in, never goes out, so it is passed from one person to another and company up another and circulates through continuously. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 02:40:40
Yes. Mooning... 
@_date: 2018-10-17 21:33:22
I see. But, Single Euro Payments is not the same as Blockchain, where payments are on a decentralized, secure, time stamped, consensus proof of work ledger. SEPA is old tech. Bitcoin transactions on the Blockchain used to be ridiculously high earlier this year so it's a big deal fees are this low to transfer such a large amount of money. Means fees will be low for everyday transactions from mass adoption. Which is the aim.

"The IRS has recently partnered with Chainalysis, a startup that offers a powerful toolset that provides the agency with the ability to track, visualize, and analyze Bitcoin transactions in an attempt to unmask Bitcoin investors and dip their fingers into the proverbial crypto pie."
This article was released a while ago. I remember a cautionary advice sent out by many of the cryptocurrency influencers like Andreas Antonopoulos, Charlie Lee, Erik Voorhees, etc., on Twitter to remove Bitcoin off exchanges. Yes, IRS is fully tracking our cryptocurrency transactions now.

Also if a node goes down while working o  a transaction alternatively another miner will pick it up. And this is rare that a node will do that. Once a transaction is created it never expires until it completes even if it takes a year, but this doesn't happen. Lol
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:43:14
Yes, I agree and thank you for your comment. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 00:54:01
Cryptocurrency transactions are on the open ledger so IRS have tools to find anyone and make them pay taxes. The people who cashout lose the most because they have to pay taxes on a high amount of money right. Where as a person who only use cryptocurrency as it is to make purchases don't have to pay that high of taxes. So a person who cashes out of Bitcoin $100K is put into a higher tax bracket and has to pay a ton in taxes. But, someone who spends from that $100k to buy something for a few grand here or there will in the end pay a lot less. Because those smaller transactions never put them into a high tax bracket. So, it's just more of a reason among many others to just not cash out of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general. I mean unless there's fear of losing, yes cashout ig. But, Bitcoin is safe that it's not, like you're not going to lose by HODLing Bitcoin. I believe. And I can back that with proofs but it'll take too long here...

Your guess is as good as mine. When I tapped it, nothing happened. What they are going to say? We don't want public to hear our Global Coin is really just another fiat currency. Facebook is I'm sure well aware what they are doing. They know it's not a cryptocurrency but they are creating their own money which will rival the American Dollar.

Yesssss! That, my friend it's a great point. I never thought about that. You're exactly right. How funny Zuckerberg woll fail, will lose if he thinks he can do with GlobalCoin with what he stole from the Winklevoss twins. And if Zuckerberg thinks he can create better than Bitcoin by engineering some more fiat currency ������
@_date: 2019-06-12 13:36:09
Yes, they are. Which is ironic seeing how they got their start. I think Facebook is very hypocritical in how they shade Bitcoin but promoted borderless information for themselves in the beginning. Now, they are wanting to appear as though they are creating borderless money but it's just a sham. Watch...

Bitcoin can be used to buy products and services just like any other currency even though it's not owned by a bank. I think that's coolest part. Lol��.
As far as stocks is concerned Bitcoin out performed all stocks and got the people's attention. It's got the pure potential to out perform then all again and go even higher soon again.
