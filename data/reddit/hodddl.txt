It's nearly impossible to create software without any bugs. Number of bugs is only going to increase with the increasing number of lines in source code. So we have in hand the impossible task: How to create a software without bugs.
Sure it is possible to for example use double the resources to review the code, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the number of bugs is reduced by 50 %, but it slows down the development.
I don't know the specifics of this latest issue, so I'm not sure was this bug in some BIP definition itself or in it's implementation. However I think it would be good to use good amount of time studying the BIPs before implementing them, and implementing BIPs to different wallets from their description rather than copying them from bitcoin core source code or from any other implementation with all the bugs.
Developing and using more wallet softwares to secure the network slows down the development but also increases number of people studying the BIPs and number of their implementations. I think it would be good that any wallet implementation in use would have no more than 33 % of network impact reducing impact of bugs found in individual wallet implementations.

Good idea, but too insecure and centralized.
Bitcoin addresses are more secure from typing mistakes plus this adds another centralized layer that is prone to cracker attacks.
This attack vector costs about $10:
No alias:
Attacker needs exponentially more processing power for each character:

Okey so compared to PayPal. PayPal uses regular money that is made by banks and lend to people for interest. Bitcoin is completely digital money that is made by people for people.

Grocery store adoption is the key. According to coinmap only two grocery stores accepting bitcoin in the area where I live, but both are still too far to use. Hoping more stores will join when lightning is stable enough.

Bitcoin is mined with specific hardware devices ASICs and to be profitable atm  requires really low electricity price.
Other cryptocurrencies can be mined with GPU.

What has changed since ATH with the technology?
If your answer is: it broke, cannot be used anymore, then be the bear.
If your answer is: It has only improved because of continuous development, be bullish.
Irrational price swings should not affect in long term investors behaviour. When looking at bitcoin price it looks like bunch of childs playing around. Let them play. I keep watching.

This is why the bubble burst. People were just expecting every transaction would fit in 1 MB? I dont get it... 
One must be in real hurry to pay such tx fee :D. Ok I must admit, I might have paid $ 10 for some not necessary tx between my own wallets. Shouldnt do that.

Why the government keeps printing money? Doesn't it just speed up the hyper inflation? And why not just burn bags of money and print just a few new notes worth those bags with couple of more zeros on them?
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:05:24
Yes it is. But it comes in form of LN rather than on chain transactions. Theres no other killer app for bitcoin than payments. Thats why we have ethereum for.

Actually bitcoin addresses have a checksum similar to what bank account numbers have. If you mistype one character the transaction is invalid. Also it is possible to make some kind of easy-to-read addresses or naming system. For example DNS works like this. Nobody wants to remember the IP address of reddit.

It depends. Cryptography is really strong. Sure i would like to insure my hardware wallet for design flaws and $ 5 wrench attack :)
@_date: 2018-06-30 11:18:15
You can, but it costs more in electricity than just buying directly from exchange and you will make really low amounts of crypto.
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:52:45
They are completely different payment methods and currencies. One cannot replace the other. He can provide bitcoin paymeny option if he is interested in experimenting. Good is that bitcoin can be accepted without intermediaries (=fees).
Edit: Accepting LN in an online shop could bring new customers. Even customers who just want to try it out for some real purchases.

That's incorrect. Best way to protect your coins is to keep your private key safe. How many times someone has lost their coins because of running SPV node?

Probably big stores accept any amount of purchases, but that doesn’t make it profitable. They just want to keep customers because of competition. Its also possible that big stores can make better deals with companies like Visa because of their sales volume.

Next to grocery shop with 0,1 &amp; fees. I could actually use it.
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:41:56
Its a good user experience, but same experience can be implemented with bitcoin as a free open source platform. It uses fiat. I prefer to use currency which does not loose value when central bank wants to print more money. Central bank controlled money does not provide anything that is not doable with bitcoin, but it takes a lot away.
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:45:33
We are very close! We just need a few improvements and applications for LN and merchants accepting it. And of course stability, but it comes with real use cases. Speculation drives volatility.
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:29:48
Nobody prevents you giving your private key to bank which then holds and insures your bitcoins ;)

Do your research on some of the big and reputable exchanges or try new decentralized exchanges like bisq. Try to avoid any exchanges that have been hacked. 
Trezor is one of the best solutions to store bitcoin. Do not keep funds on exchanges. Prefer open source offline wallet solutions. Keep your private key secure and backes up.
I would be paranoid when running software hot wallet. I would setup a clean linux system for the purpose and use it for nothing else. Your daily use Windows PC with software bitcoin wallet is risky.
Bitcoin.org should be a good start. It is home page of the first bitcoin wallet ever existed. Bitcoin.com however is a scam site which promotes altcoin called Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

Good point.
If we register ownerships of all the things in blockchain, then there is not so much pressure for deflation of bitcoin price. I could just do atomic swap to trade land for house and get remainder in bitcoin etc. Things needs to be registered in blockchain in order for trading of things to be as easy as trading of bitcoin. Without paperwork.
However there is still one big issue. A house is something in real world and it can get destroyed, while purely digital money cannot. Also liquidity of houses is bad. But then again, there are also real world things that do not get destroyed so easily and that has better liquidity.
Still I think if we imagine a world where bitcoin is global mainstream currency, people has realized that it is not automatically deflatonary, when wealth can be stored in blockchain in other forms of things as well.
Maybe even information could be tradeable in blockchain and having money like properties, still being digital and so, indestructible. Though information has two properties that make it bad for holding. First, it can be duplicated when given to anyone, which means that it keeps good value only once. Second, same piece of information can be discovered even if one holds the information forever.
People realize that deflationary money does not create wealth and because of that people will not expect it to be always deflanationary. Bitcoin is a good start for something to come: resource based economy in blockchain. And money is just one resource. It's a resource with good liquidity and transferability. Token market will not go anywhere. It's part of this resource based economy to come.

I guess you mean websites claiming to accept USD but unly accepting Master Card.
Bitpay does not provide standard bitcoin address for payment.

Taxation is not going to end, and if its going to end it would take decades. Companies report how much income they pay for the employees and products have VAT. These are taxes that are not affected by bitcoin. Only capital gain taxes are affected. However I was thinking if maybe most of taxation could be done as VAT. VAT in basic food supplies could be minimal, because everyone needs them, while VAT in premium products that rich mostly buy could be way more.
Economy needs some kind of balancing, pure capitalism is worse than the current system for most of people.

I would be very cautious when using this with the default 3rd party lndhub. It would be very easy for this 3rd party to just collect enough users and disappear with all the money, as it's just some software on some random server without any regulation. Please wait for wallet apps where you control your own funds or host your own lndhub. Unfortunately this is only worth down voting, as promoting such insecure unregulated 3rd party solution is unethical.
