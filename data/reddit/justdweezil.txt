Are you new to Reddit? It alters where his post will show up when sorted by "hot"/"best"/"top", which are the default sorts. It means when people come into a thread to read the first few comments (which is most people most of the time) his comment will be lower than it ought to be, given the relevance of the commentary, due to some people downvoting with their emotions. This means less people will see it than ought to have.
Downvoting stupidly - violating basic Reddiquette - ruins the diversity and quality of discussion in the subreddit. It promotes circle-jerking, which this subreddit suffers badly from.
Does that make sense?

I'm not sure you understand - if I buy a jet, it should be able to fly the intended distance. When I buy servers as a software engineers (not Bitcoin miners... I'm not a miner) I run them 24/7 at near full capacity all day. If they can't do that, they aren't performing their intended use.
It's like buying a dump truck and then saying burdening it with a heavy load is unreasonable. No. It's built to do that, sorry mate.

Eventually mining difficulty will increase to the point that the entire rig will make less Bitcoin than the cost of the electrical bill. Mining rigs have an extremely limited lifespan. This is how the "cloud hashing" companies rip people off - great revenue the first few months of the contract, and near zero at the end.
The way you continue to profit is by immediately reinvesting the returns of the first few months (which ought to pay off the rig) into new rigs, and then disposing of the old rigs.

A new cryptocurrency that has a better incentive structure than Bitcoin could come around next week and overtake Bitcoin in months if a few things go well and a few exchanges and institutions adopt it (which is not as technically difficult as setting things up the first time).

How is it possible there is no reasonable option below $500 for the question "what do you think one bitcoins worth will be in one year from now"? There is one option below $500 - "Nothing". But there are FOUR other choices above $500, when the price is barely above $570 today?

Actually, that other weird Thai Baht symbol you seem to think is the official Bitcoin symbol is just something picked up at random. It's popular now because it was the first one... but I can put Ƀ pretty easily into this text box, no issues. It's also unambiguous.

Even at $400 per BTC, the ~3600BTC mined every day requires $1,440,000 daily investment just to maintain the price if miners sell off all their coin. That doesn't sound like "barely".
@_date: 2014-03-26 23:38:26
Great pitch with extremely valid points. Note, however, that he said this about "crypto currency" in general - not Bitcoin. That is the biggest issue with these astronomical Bitcoin valuations. Other coins can be created out of thin air, and only a few institutional connections or technological improvements are required to make Bitcoin nearly worthless as a transactional medium (when compared with an alternative coin).
@_date: 2014-03-30 22:35:10
3% cash back? I get 1.5% cash back from a credit card, and if I buy BTC off Coinbase I have to pay 1% + bank fee + hope the price doesn't change too much before I buy.
So it ends up being POSSIBLY 0.5% savings if I don't get bitten by volatility.
(Let's put aside the fact that if the merchant rips me off, my credit card company will help me out and make sure I don't lose my money.)
Bitcoin still sucks for buying things.

Mind-blowingly funny that the libertarians in here may finally be realizing that a market, depending on its inherent incentive structure, can completely fuck its own participants. Miners have to avoid variance intrinsic to mining, so they prefer to concentrate.
They have no individual incentive to "take the hit" and go to a smaller pool. Tragedy of the commons at its best.

All great technologies are difficult to use at first, and become easier with time as the kinks in the process are smoothed out. Just like the internet was inaccessible 10 - 20 years ago, but today can be used by an extremely broad audience. You are coming at Bitcoin in its infancy. Of course there are issues - and you are surprised?
When dealing with a relatively new technology, surely you understand that being an early adopter (in the grand sense of the word) comes with a big fat "caveat emptor"?
@_date: 2014-04-28 18:10:07
Shouldn't we all be a bit distressed that the first recommendation to all users is that they put their coins in immediate cold storage, rather than spend them and expand the Bitcoin economy? If users cannot feel safe having coins immediately available, then that suggests something is broken.
I have money available for spending immediately and without fear from my bank, without having to deal with the inconvenience and risks of cold storage.
@_date: 2014-04-19 20:15:03

Yeah, I actually did speak with him a few years ago. I was part of a group of students with a shared interest in philosophy and economics that decided to call in and ask a few prepared questions. He was generally evasive, always bringing back discussions to a peculiar kind of Utopian vision without really seeming to grasp the issues we were highlighting. He never quite seemed to understand nuanced questions or references, and I now believe this has to do with both his thin background and lack of meaningful interaction with giants in the field.
It's part of what makes him captivating to newer people - he seems to be promising so much, but when it comes to substance, he comes up short and ultimately deceptive. At the end of the day there are reasons why he has little influence and appeal outside of his circle of fan boys.

$ remaining unconfused with other currencies is because they often prefix it with another indicator, like $AUS or C$. From the Canadian dollar Wiki:

I watched Molyneux for a while years ago, but upon further investigation, he's a total quack. He's always reliably towed the anarcho-cap line, which makes him dependable, and he's always trying dress up this school of thought with "philosophy", which it badly needs - the problem is that he doesn't actually use the rigor and thought patterns that make philosophy so useful.
He's more of a modern Ayn Rand than a philosopher, which is why it's very easy to find so many non-philosophers calling him "one of the greatest philosophers".

I prefer not to over simplify to the point of absurdity and believe sometimes government solutions have legitimately superior incentive structures, and sometimes they don't.
The specific features of the goods and services in question are ultimately more determinative of the proper solution than generalizations like "government or not".
The libertarians here, and all over the internet, generally believe that "no government interference" is most of the way to setting up a good market, and as our Proof of Stake issue demonstrates, we're more than capable of making a hell of a mess without any government intervention at all.

I sure as hell don't prefer a "market" solution where big players like ghash fix it for us, or we "trust" them despite their profit motive.
I prefer we go to the most sensible level available to us: reengineer the platform that creates the "market". Reconsider Proof of Work. I don't think that's actually a "market" solution, since it's kind of like we're creating a new market (or fundamentally altering an existing market) altogether.
That's part of what makes Bitcoin so interesting. We have a whole other "level" available to us that isn't governmental and isn't market-based. We can create the system that "regulates" or "manages" the market (which is usually a government) with software. Very cool.

1. International - sure. Among friends? I can use Dwolla/Paypal for free or near free. As a consumer buying from a merchant? I can protect myself with a credit card, and make the transaction more quickly and easily to boot.
2. Pre-paid Visa cards/Vanilla cards, etc. are just as good if not better. They're reloadable instantly online with zero effort.
3. Believe it or not, oppressed countries still prefer USD cash and will have great difficulty using Bitcoin which is still significantly less fungible.
4. Not yet, really. More detail?
5. Bitcoin is not even remotely a store of value yet. Meeting this condition requires meeting a variety of other conditions that haven't been established.
6. It depends - internationally, yes, which I happily grant is an advantage Bitcoin currently holds. Domestically, there are a variety of ways to transmit cash instantly for free or near free.
7. Privacy, sure - but this is essentially the same as the dark market / illicit (even if not immoral) money transfer point.
So, Bitcoin's strengths are still limited to:
1. Private, remote money transfer - dark markets, etc. (Which, I should add, still suffer badly from scammers, hackers, and other significant points of failure.)
2. International money transfer.
I'm not saying the rest is not feasible in the future, just that we have not arrived at that point. There's a big difference between telling people that Bitcoin has huge advantages now, and telling them that it has a few small advantages now in certain limited cases but could potentially offer large advantages later assuming a variety of technologies and institutions are realized.

You've almost got it. There's two last issues:


You aren't most people. This is very hard to understand for young people, but it isn't the case. Most people only read the first few top level comments and some of the comments further down. Sure, if you're in a very small thread, that increases the likelihood that someone who takes the trouble to go into the comments might read them all, but generally speaking, downvoting comments you disagree with is still bad policy (see Reddiquette).
The other issue is more subtle, so I expect you won't understand: a few interesting studies have shown that the score of a comment subtly affects how people perceive the quality of the comment. This is part of the motivation for [score hidden] in certain subreddits lately. Surely you recognize that if the score didn't matter, hiding the score would be pointless? See for occasional interesting discussion on this topic.
I hope that answers your questions.
@_date: 2015-01-20 05:23:37
Using a credit card properly is, given the current infrastructure, for all intents and purposes, free. The merchant fees and transaction costs are already built-in. Given the two options - paying an extra few percent (minimum) with Bitcoin and accepting liability vs. a percentage discount and limiting liability - credit cards are free.
Regarding identity theft, you're just conflating the aggregate cost of all kinds of identity theft with credit card fraud, specifically.
In my time using Bitcoin, I know of over $50,000 worth of coin *first hand* that stolen or defrauded in a variety of ways. The victims of Bitcoin theft have, with one exception I can think of, were left in the dirt. (Ironically, the one person who I know got his money bank was reimbursed by his bank, even though it wasn't entirely their responsibility.)
Many here like to argue that Bitcoin allows you to do your own banking, which somehow increases security. The truth is it offloads all the technical responsibilities to the consumer. For very few of us, this is a genuine improvement. In general, it means people stand to lose much more with no recourse. With credit card fraud, you get your money back.
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:57:23

You can notify them you'll be traveling (via website), or request they lift travel restrictions over the phone. I've never had a problem with this. Usually takes 2 minutes.
What's not liberating is when traveling recently, a rental car company tried to scam me and insisted on charging me despite declining their terms and walking out without the car.
I called my credit card company and the issue was resolved without my spending a dime. Took 5 minutes on the phone.
With Bitcoin, I'd be screwed and would likely need to involve the police or courts to retrieve my funds.
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:02:40
Agree. Your receiving down votes is evidence of the group-think permeating the sub.
When I buy something with my credit card, I'm protected from any fraud perpetrated by the merchant. I also get a 2% discount due to "cash back". With Bitcoin, the most common best case scenario is I pay 1% extra (buying coin with Coinbase) - and, barring any sudden market shifts - I buy at regular price.
Why pay 3% more *and* subject myself to the risk of vendor fraud if I don't have to?

Since I only use cash in-person, it's not really comparable, is it? As other responses to my comment suggest, Bitcoin is generally for internet transactions where the possibility of absconding with the money is easier and more prevalent.

Lol it's not backpedaling. The advance reservation was performed online. As agreed, online you have two options: Bitcoin or credit card. If I had done my advance reservation with Bitcoin, I'd be screwed. With credit card, I got my money back. Very simple.
When I arrived at the car rental place, it's a different story. I never completed the transaction since they altered the terms of the deal.
Regarding your other point, rental businesses should be able to charge a deposit. The whole point, from the business's perspective, is that *they have control over your deposit funds* since they have already taken on the trouble of ensuring the rented item is available (possibly taking on an opportunity cost).
You're imagining a very simple kind of transaction.
Making a deposit with a credit card is like a free, totally secure escrow.

I've never had a rejected payment, once I learned I could notify them of travel.


You're not liable if there are future transactions performed without your permission. Also, this is why Bitcoin can't really do recurring payments yet.


Bitcoin has a middle-man built-in, since you need to acquire the coin from your fiat, or get fiat from your coin. Any counter-arguments that envision a world without fiat are silliness, of course.
The only case I can see Bitcoin coming out on top is in the black market, which I grant is Bitcoin's undisputed "killer app".

If someone fraudulently uses your *debit* card, your description is correct. None of that is necessary with a credit card. There's no affidavit to sign or return. You call, you file a dispute, and that's that.
With Bitcoin, if you entered into a transaction with a fraudulent merchant, you're done. You need to go through some kind of escrow with every transaction, which is not always possible - or even preferable.

Markets are a form of incentive structure. In certain situations, depending on the goods and services transacted, it works. In others, it eats itself.
This is the same. We have created a market for mining by creating a specific incentive structure, and it is beginning to eat itself.

I believe it will be in a range between $200 - $2000 at most, erring on the low end between $200 - $500. I could expand on this at length but I'm not sure the community would be receptive.

I trade Bitcoin on LocalBitcoins often, and I have zero interest in aiding or abetting a crime. If I even have a suspicion they may be doing something illegal with the coin, let alone mentioning it explicitly, I terminate contact. Simple.

Quote is fake. This article is fake. The fact that this got so high on is a big, big red flag for this whole sub.

Is there another source? This seems like fake news.

If you're gonna pay with Bitcoin, and then rebuy, why bother spending the Bitcoin?
I think you just undid your point entirely.
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:21:29
I understood that "Bitcoin is dead. Game over." was meant to be a sarcastic remark, ribbing people who have said that in the past.
It's also a distracting shit post and nobody cares.

This is a classic user experience design problem. If people are REPEATEDLY using your appliance/technology/system incorrectly, that means *the technology/system is not well designed*.
When something is a bitch to use correctly, it needs a redesign.
EDIT: To be clear, my point is that if "you dumb fuckers need to stop making it so easy for people to steal your Bitcoin" is a pervasive and common problem (which it is), then the problem is in the design of Bitcoin. We need to improve the ease and friendliness of using Bitcoin securely. It should be more difficult to use Bitcoin incorrectly, and natural to use correctly, like other well-designed things.
EDIT2: Thanks for the gold! It sounds like some people feel very strongly about this.

I'm not sure if you're serious, but if you were really that dedicated to piling up Bitcoin, it'd be far better to just spend 70% of your salary buying Bitcoin and the keep the other 30% in USD.
And for the record, this seems like a terrible idea.
