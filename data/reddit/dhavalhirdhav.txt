After playing game for almost 3 hours got 0.0001 BTC consecutively 2 times in span of 5 minutes of playing :D
and now game is sending bunch of payment in single transaction. I guess because of this payment system was down for sometime.

Donated 0.005 to The Water Project. Because lack of clean water introduces most of the viruses, germs, diseases that we have.
