1x BFL Jalapeno. I don't have much to spend on ASICS, but it is what it is.

190 right now, actually. [
Edit: 156 now. 
Edit 2: 190's again
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:04:07
yeah. They definitely opened.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:01:52
I wouldn't be supprised. Some last minute/down the the wire testing before the thing goes live. Again, not terribly uncommon. They can always postpone opening if they find something wrong(right now I'm seeing 60+ seconds of lag, so either they opened, or they found something)

From [here]( it will be at most 300W for a 60 GH/s setup, but it sounds like from [here]( that they could possibly manage to bring it down to 100W-120W per 30 GH/s setup, but that has yet to be seen. The upper bound from what it sounds like is 300W for 60 GH/s at the moment. 
Another variable is what the other wafers have in store. IC/ASIC production is a tricky thing, as there's a lot of variance in the chips themselves. All we know about is the two wafers/two different data points. Those samples could be either both low for the whole average, or both high. We really don't know, so it's tricky to say exactly what they'll be pulling at this point.

You're welcome. Generally the format to see Google's cache for a given page is to search cache:url . It's definitely a handy trick to know.

I'd say go for it. There's been corrections/drops nearly every week, generally midweek, and this seems to have sorted itself out by now. It's your money though, do what you want with it. Nobody ever went broke taking a profit however.

That's been pretty much my experience with them, yeah. I had ordered an E3 a couple of years back, but didn't get it for about 4 months. I had forgotten that I even had ordered it by then, so I was really confused when I got what seemed like a random laser in the mail.

Hopefully they'll revamp their trading engine's architecture to cope with the growth of the market. As they were initially designing their system, scalability probably wasn't a concern then(too small of a market, not enough people trading on the platform, etc), but it definitely should be now.

I don't have nearly that much(I'm holding onto .58 BTC right now, still have yet to sell any coin in this run up), but I've looked into this sort of thing.
[You need to report all single transactions over 10,000 USD to the IRS](
So, how I would do something like that is, either a) take it out in one big transaction, and report it anyway to the IRS, or b) take it out in 6x&lt;10k transactions and not have to fill the report, but still likely have to pay Capital Gains Taxes on it.
As far as how the banks will react, I am not quite sure what they would do. I would suspect it depends on the bank. I definitely could see them reporting the transaction if over 10k, but I wouldn't be surprised if they had some sort of system to detect fraud that may trigger from a sudden influx of 50k to your account.

Sorry man, I feel your pain. I'm in a few classes that use them quite a bit...

Ah, OK. That explains why they haven't refunded my order yet(emailed them a week ago). I'd suspect the backlog is happening due to people getting out from the power issues. Not my reason for hopping out of the queue, but I think that's what the majority is doing.

I think they're running tests right now, seeing how it handles under some artificial loads. I used to do the same thing with a web server that I was working on. I would artificially slam it with requests to see how it handled the load(it wasn't production, but a local copy of the server, of course).

When you draw [Bode plots]( from transfer functions, you do actually draw straight lines on a log chart.

I've only been here for a few weeks, and I'm shocked by your generosity. [Have some hugs]( hopefully it helps a bit.
@_date: 2013-03-10 03:09:19
Yeah, same. However, with the way the price per BTC has been going, we'll see(I paid in fiat, not bitcoins :P )
