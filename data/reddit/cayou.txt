Hey stop being such a dick, dude. Not cool.

It's way, way too silly to be taken seriously by even the laziest intern at a local newspaper. I mean come on:


And then they go on to mention the CO2 emissions of the great firewall of China.

Doesn't make immediate sense to me, though. Wouldn't a capped supply eventually lead to deflation?

You jest, but that's kind of what OP is getting at. If an old person asks you how the internet works, they're probably not wondering about servers and protocols and the 7-layer OSI model. They just want to know how to get that YouTube thing their grandchildren keep talking about.
I've seen countless explanations of how bitcoin and mining *works*, I kind of get it and it's pretty clever, but I still have no idea how to go about buying bitcoins, storing them or sending them to someone. Which, AFAIC, confirms what OP is saying.

Ooops, replied to the wrong comment, maybe you got a non-sequitur in your inbox.
I don't necessarily think unlimited expansion is impossible, you can improve how a given (limited) amount of resources is used. Value is not tied to physical resources. And even if humankind's growth does stop or collapse in the future, this is unlikely to happen before the last bitcoin is mined. Once that last bitcoin is mined, people will have a huge incentive not to spend their bitcoins, since the total amount of wealth on the planet will be growing while the total amount of currency will not.
