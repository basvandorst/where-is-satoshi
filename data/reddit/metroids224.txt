The issue is - with legal medical marijuana dispensaries - is they aren't federally legal.

Not too sure, actually. This guy isn't recognizable, though.

Yeah, them having all of that information kind of defeats one of the purposes of Bitcoin.

Hey, professional student here. I'd like to think I'm qualified to answer this since I've gone to school the majority of my life. You most definitely get more than something like: "50/50 Great Job!". Most teachers write quite a bit on your paper, ESPECIALLY negative commentary. I've had teachers reject papers and lecture me on how plagiarism is bad, and I could get in trouble for it, give me a '0' on the assignment, and say that the telling thing that my paper wasn't of my own writing was because the grammar and word choice was one of an older adult. Things like this aren't unbelievable, and they happen quite a bit.

Oh, I blame myself as well, it'd be silly not to.

I don't think it's a silver spoon situation though, they spent ~$5,000 building the apartment over the detached garage, and he'll spend ~250,000 on a house.

See, I understand that to a degree. A family member of mine who is in his early twenties lives at home with his mom and dad, but they built an apartment on top of their garage for him to live in. The only reason he lives at home, is because he doesn't want move out only to take out a loan, or rent a house. He wants to buy one straight up with cash, and he's actually close to reaching that goal, surprisingly.

The least likely thing in the world will be that we all get along. There will always be conflict, it's the fault of the human race.

I think it's just a family looking out, who knows it's much smarter to buy a house in cash rather than rent, or take a loan out. Different beliefs from you I suppose.

You realize it's not 10%, it's just a flat 50 cent fee. This is the same as using my bank card. I love Bitcoin as much as the next guy, but please don't spread lies about Fiverr.

Going down 2% isn't crashing. Crashing would be like it went down 75%.

Well it'd be covered by the fact that people lived next door, as the garage has the same hook-ups. I don't know about you, my parents spent just about 5k on renovations for my comfort, whether that was paint, new carpet, a new bed/mattress, etc. They didn't spend 5k for his comfort, they spent 5k so he didn't have to spend 1.5k a month on housing, and after he moved out they could rent it out ~1k a month, and make back their money no problem.

You really have a great username.

18 in the US is pretty much when you're on your own.

Well his father is a contractor, so it really was no problem. It's better to save, and buy a house, than to rent or take out a loan. He never comes in their house, it would be the same as buying a house next door. "Mommy and daddy" aren't paying his way into his twenties, he's lived alone in that apartment since he was 18 I believe. Not sure why you're so angry, I highly doubt you had almost $250,000 to buy a house with when you were 24-26, all of that money that YOU worked for, not given to you by anybody else.

Most kids are smarter than teachers ;)
