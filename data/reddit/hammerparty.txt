No, the luck was that my bank lender just approved the Bitcoin I have to be counted as liquidity for a higher construction loan amount. This is the only way I have found where Bitcoin can be used without incurring capital gains tax. The bank does not require I convert the Bitcoin to fiat, only that I set the Bitcoin aside and that it cannot be used during construction. This insures the bank that if anything crazy happens during construction, I have an investment set aside that can be sold to cover any additional cost above the loan amount. I also would not be able to qualify for the loan amount needed if not for the amount of  BTC I have and it's gains! The lesson from this......HODL people!! HODL!!

If I wait till March 15%. At that point every coin I own will fall under long-term capital gains tax.

No, I decide to play it safe and see where things go. I'm just going to hodl with what I have for the next 5 to 10 years. Within that timeframe if trends continue I should still do pretty well.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:29:23
Nope... Played it safe and dumb...

The Binance exchange and it can only be bought with BTC or Ethereum.

My wife and I ended up just deciding to HODL since we view Bitcoin as more of a long term investment. I did however take $20k worth of my free Bitcoin Cash and trade it for IOTA. Now if IOTA can reach the value of Ethereum we will be sitting pretty!

I did not but I'm at a good place with what I have. Now the big issue is capital gains tax. It's idiotic that not only are you taxed for your gains but also that your gains additionally increase your annual taxed income thereby possibly pushing you into a higher tax bracket!

Doesn't matter if it moved to Mars. When this kind of movement from one source happens, the speculation of such a large transaction is enough to affect the market.

Well you have your opinion and have mine, the only difference is I'm not on a forum for something I do not support wasting my time...

Bitcoin is still in its infancy but on its way to global acceptance as place of storage for wealth. The more BTC is dispersed the more the volatility will decrease. I can't name a stock or piece of property that I own that has been more lucrative than the gains I have made from owning bitcoin since 2015. With that being said, I can live with the volatility! You sound like my bitter friends who are upset they didn't get in early but be reassured it's still not too late. One thing to remember, last year at this time Bitcoin was $1700!! Even with the current drops it's still performed better than anything in existence. Now stop trolling and go do some research.

The amount was not added to any of their known addresses.

Mt. Gox just sold off 8,200 BTC. Everytime they move this amount of coin this is going to happen.

Bitcoin has a long way to go before it ever becomes a currency, so until then it will be a speculative investment. You also seem like quite the hypocrite since the only points you've made lean towards trying to discourage people from investing in BTC, yet you say you want to see it become a currency. It will never become a currency if people listen to you and take the stance you have taken. Bitcoin needs support and early adoption from financial institution and private individuals before it can ever stand a chance of becoming a currency. I certainly hope this day comes but until then I won't be telling people to ignore the financial gains that can be had investing in it wisely now. What I will continue to stress is that I am not a financial advisor and that when you invest in Bitcoin you should do so with caution like with any other investment. Bitcoin can be treated as a form of digital gold now and that's not speculation! Also, just like with any stock if the price of an asset goes up of course people will sell but this won't lead to some mass Exodus that puts Bitcoins existence in jeopardy. You can already see an example of what happens as the price goes up by looking back at the history of BTC. The more it goes up, yes people sell but this is offset by the amount of attention and new adopters gained by each increase.

High value is not what I think gives Bitcoin value but it has changed my life. If you were smart enough to realize a good thing early then you'd be in the same boat. I won't sit here and list off all of the things BTC has the potential to do or become. You can use Google or YouTube for that. I also won't sit here and try to win you over  when you've clearly made up your mind that Bitcoin is a poor investment. My early investment in Bitcoin has given me the freedom to live my life as I see fit. No mortgage payment, no school loans, no car note payment, no debt and I've already cashed out the amount I put into Bitcoin and am still holding enough to retire if I choose, in one of the largest cities on the West Coast. If you've achieved something similar I'm sure you'd be of similar opinion but your not. Your someone trolling the forum of something you don't believe with clearly no purpose other than to troll. I'm here because I've had success with bitcoin and want others to know my story and have similar success. Obviously the majority here are going to be in favor of Bitcoin. If you want to find people of like mind you are in the wrong place. As for anyone else who may be reading this rant, Bitcoin has changed my life because I realized it's risk and reward and invested with caution. Only spend what you can afford to lose has become an old adage in this community but it's still the best advice anyone can give. Good luck to all and for those who have invested, hodl!

I wish I could say yes but my wife told me to stop being greedy and that was the end of it....

Probably nothing, there are going to be plenty of big fish to fry before the IRS can even begin tackle small unreported gains. Keep in mind this is not financial or legal advice and I am no expert in the matter.

Didn't tell him not to pay taxes. I do on my crypto gains. Just telling him how I see it and if you had $5 dollars in gains from buying a stick of gum back in 2013, you most likely have very little to worry about. Of course what's a small amount to the OP may not be a small amount to the IRS but I'm not going to ignore that it's going to be a nightmare for the IRS to get everyone, especially if you owe a very small amount? In the end not paying taxes is stupid if you value your time, money and freedom no matter how much you owe. Sound advice Chob but if I had less than $1000 dollars in gains back in 2013 I personally wouldn't lose any sleep over not having paid the taxes on it. Very few people knew how or even that they needed to track their cryptocurrency gains till the government figured out how to classify it recently. I'm not going to all of a sudden start trying to scare everyone into worrying over every cent of gains they have incurred but I will tell them to use common sense and to know that anytime you choose to not pay taxes you choose to take a risk.

I bought as much as I could before BTC hit 2k. Now I am holding.
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:20:09
It's money I've been saving for the past 10 years for the construction of my first home. It should be noted this amount will only cover about 30% of the cost.
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:13:26
You've been offering really sound advice and have given me a lot to chew on. I really appreciate your input!
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:24:26
Indeed but next year I'll be saying I should have bought it now.... Also, I have been buying BTC since 2013 but I live in LA so even the couple hundred thousand I've already made buying Bitcoin won't be enough.
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:45:39
I'm with you and really what's the chance of it not continuing the same rate if growth by the end of next year? This is like Apple stock before the iPod but we can actually see it coming!! Am I just crazy??
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:42:15
Thanks for the advice and the forewarning. I've examined what I could lose and heres how I look at it. 300k at the moment is not life changing for me and it's just sitting in my bank doing nothing. Meanwhile the smaller amount of money I've been investing in bitcoin over the past 5 years has made me several hundred grand. I've been conservative when investing in BTC but over the years I've been questioning why I haven't been investing more! If I wouldn't have played it safe in the past (even last year), I wouldn't be asking you for advice, I'd be decorating my new house. At this point, looking back at bitcoins track record is there any reason to think it won't hit 10k per coin in the near future? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:25:27
I'd be SOL if I lost both.
