This is another example of Bitcoin failing as a currency.  If we cannot come up with solutions to simple questions like this than bitcoin is reduced to a protocol not a currency.

This is why bitcoin will never become mainstream as a currency.  People trust banks to hold and store their money.  They feel comfortable logging into it online.  And if your credit card is stollen they re-imburse you for the charges.  These are features that everyday common people value which Bitcoin does not currently provide.

I'd try buying some instead of by some.

Comments like this are why some people don't take Bitcoin seriously.  Choices like this should be made with your head not your heart.

You still don't address the point.  When did you buy that $20/BTC? a year a go?  So what about stores that sell products do they change the value of their products on an hourly basis to keep up with the volitile change in bitcoin?  What about the employees that earn hourly wages? Do their wages change throughout the day?  Do you go to work earning 0.03BTC/hr and leave earning 0.01BTC/hr? How do you plan paying your bills?  How do you plan buying groceries?
That is what Krugman ment by "stable store of value" and what the Forbes article did not address.

I'm not a huge fan of Paul Krugman, and I can't believe I'm about to defend him, but the Forbes article doesn't address Krugman's point:


As Krugman explains: 


Yes Krugman is a liberal, Yes Krugman likes to hop from one economic bubble to the next, Yes Krugman believes stimulus should be the next bubble, Yes Krugman used the term "Evil" in his title to get attention but Forbes did not address Krugman's main point: right now Bitcoin is too unstable to be a currency.

I think Bitcoin as a currency has failed.  Bitcoin as a protocol has exceeded greatly.
