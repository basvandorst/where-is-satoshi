Yes, I understand in theory capitalism has great aspects, but in practice it causes alot of global problems because humans are greedy and power corrupts. Alot of other systems are great in theory too. I didn't chose this system, I was born into it and I wanna see it change and evolve into something where so many people didnt have to suffer all the time. Why should money = freedom? Just being ALIVE should equal freedom. 
Yes. I am a hippy.
And a woman. *GASPS FROM THE PEANUT GALLERY*

I said globally.

I'd say right now, capitalism causes more suffering globally than communism.

Pretty sure the internet wasn't created because of capitalism.

I live in Vancouver Canada. The chance of me ever being able to afford a house or business in the place I was born is slim to nil due to capitalism. Yes, I realize that many countries under the communist rule are suffering as well, but think about all the people(and kids) in those countries that work in the clothing and plastic factories, the coffee and cocoa plantations for dollars a day. Every luxury and cheap item we get to enjoy here in the western world comes of the skin of someone else's back in some other country due too capitalism. Capitalism has brainwashed everyone into thinking we need all this crap so now there's a demand and we go to other countries to produce it. Think of all the global pollution and garbage that the consumption of crap has caused due to capitalism. Think of all the people that capitalize off of selling drugs, selling children, selling guns for unnecessary oil wars. Sure communism has killed alot of people too and I'm not saying its better, but capitalism is destroying the planet.

It took 400 years for people to get used to paper money. Then it took 40 years for people to get used to credit cards. Maybe it will only take 10 years for people to get used to the idea of digital currency. Alot of people in China already use their phones to pay for many different things. Maybe its not as far off as we think!

Well back in my day a whole Bitcoin use ta be $0.05!
and in those days, Bitcoin had pictures of bumblebees on ‘em. “Give me five bees for a quarter,” you’d say. Now where were we? Oh yeah – the important thing was I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn’t have white onions because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones…
- Me, to my future grandchildren.
