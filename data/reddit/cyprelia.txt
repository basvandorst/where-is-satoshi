Hodl! Haven’t lost until you sell out. It’s all money you can afford to lose anyway, right? Start of the year has been a slump last 3 years in a row. Wait it out ��

I doubt it. Probs a scam

Try transfer but it will takes ages with no fee

Yeah that’s the thing. The coin cannot go to zero it will always retain some value as long as someone mines it
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:37:46
I guess I never really paid much attention. Just sold as I mined until it no longer was profitable.

Jeez wow

How is bank faster? Takes 3-4 days. CC is instant
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:44:49
7k as of now!!
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:32:26
Had it ever been this much a change though?
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:12:21
100% serious problems. But crazy market manipulation

Has there ever been a crash that big in btc? What reason was it for? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:41:25
The sheer anxiety would kill me 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:05:17
Below 5k? Isn’t the point of a currency like this to not be effected by events like this?
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:07:11
Is that even possible?
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:08:51
Not worth it unless it’s for the meme
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:57:40
Really? Wow. No malice towards bcc but shouldn’t this switch if it was going to happen happen back at the fork? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:06:41
That’s true, seen many threads on people complaining about verification that want to buy in. Why wouldn’t they just buy bcc though?
