But Bitcoin is my religion and I'm a fundamentalist and all my money is in BTC, so all the other coins must be worthless. They just have to be.  Please Jesus, make them worthless.
@_date: 2016-08-14 22:29:49
There are no cheap coins now  $560 is extremely expensive.

"This is Good for Bitcoin!"
If the industry is regulated, then people will trust them more and more people will buy BTC.  Then it will go the moon and I can quit my crappy job that I have because I'm dumb.
@_date: 2017-02-18 21:28:09
Awesome. You may get 2 sales per year and certainly worth what you invested in infrastructure.
@_date: 2017-03-01 03:55:21
You can buy about as much with gold as you can with Bitcoin.   Actually, you could most likely trade gold, via Craiglist for more than you could with Bitcoin.
And of course you can sell gold for cash, much easier than you can sell Bitcoin for cash.

They have been everywhere.  Try to pay attention next time.  Why would I go back and look for some to prove the obvious to you.
@_date: 2016-06-04 03:14:53
Awesome.  I remember articles like this in 2013 and it never happened, but maybe this time is different.
@_date: 2016-06-12 20:48:02
Plenty bought at $800+, but most of those are long gone. They got burned by their bad trading and never came back.
@_date: 2016-06-07 07:51:16
Sorry but I don't work for free.
@_date: 2016-06-12 20:31:45
Average purchase price means nothing.  What matters is when you buy and when you sell each BTC and fraction thereof.
@_date: 2016-06-12 00:59:12
Halfway there to a lot of the bagholders around here being back to even after a three year wait.
@_date: 2016-06-01 12:48:29
Excellent.  Maybe there will be 12 new Bitcoin users that come out of this.
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:28:26
You held from $495 to $175, and a bunch from $1050 to $175.  I don't know if I would call that good trading or investing, when that drop was over such a long period of time.   
You certainly don't need my approval but just saying every buy and sell, and every moment when you decide to not buy or sell is a decision, and is a good or bad decision.  And that is not necessarily decided by where the price goes eventually.  Sometimes you get lucky...good luck or bad luck.
But anyway good call with buying at $240 for sure.
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:18:15
Yes of course...buy and hold is their religion.
@_date: 2016-06-19 02:54:05
The chart of global LBC volume shows it as being flat for the last 18 months.  That is not good.
But the USA volume is still increasing steadily and got to think it a big chunk of it, of course.
@_date: 2016-06-02 03:19:26
Bitcoin is so much better than gold, although the risk of gold dropping 80% in a few months is not nearly as high as with Bitcoin.  But the advantages make up for that, for the most part.
@_date: 2016-06-07 06:47:04
you what's even more cool...2000% return in three months.
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:00:50
So buying BTC and holding it has been no better than an S&amp;P Index fund ...not much to brag about.   Not that you are bragging but talking about others who live in their own little Bitcoin bubble.
@_date: 2016-06-12 01:59:48
Why would it not jump overnight where you are?   It is pumped when the pumpers feel like doing the pumping.
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:59:59
At this rate of growth, there will be 100 Bitcoin ATMs in the United States by 2025 !!!!

She's probably a dummy who blew some guys to get some notoriety but she got to the level where true talent and skill is needed and she forgot her kneepads and failed.

"If it breaks $500 there will be plenty of attention on it. Until then, it's just another small rally."
said two weeks ago. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 03:06:14
No I didn't read that long post.   I went straight to the charts and graphs, which don't have a spin to them.  But I'm sure there is a LBC chart of volume in USD, so lets see a link to that.
@_date: 2016-06-07 13:56:48
8 seconds or 8 weeks or 8 years...doesn't matter. Sorry but being on here a long time doesn't make you wiser.  But ad hominem attack is just lame.
@_date: 2016-06-12 22:14:43
Well i might have agreed with you in late 2013 but that was before BTC dropped from 1100 to 172.  However, I guess you can only lose 100% and can make many multiples of 100% if it keeps going up.
@_date: 2016-12-07 00:32:30
And there are zero altcoins in the real world that reflect your hypothetical fantasy example.
@_date: 2016-12-14 03:29:44
And no one cares, but us.  That's the truly sad part about it.
@_date: 2016-11-27 10:08:52
Why would you give an "obviously" fake name and address?   Just to fuck with them or make some kind of point that no one cares about?
Just make the donation as John Smith, 10 Oak Street and no one is going to care and of course they are going to use the donation.  Or be more creative with it if you want.  
@_date: 2016-12-06 22:52:04
Rising over the last few months
Falling over the last few years
@_date: 2016-11-27 11:06:12
Apparently, the more options they give to donate, the more it "confuses" people and the less donations they actually receive.  I read this somewhere and sounds goofy and suspect, but people are stupid so perhaps that's true.  So I doubt it is a slight against Bitcoin and they are just trying to maximize the money they receive.
@_date: 2016-12-14 05:46:44
I doubt they will do it in the USA anytime soon because USD is world's reserve currency and a move like that would put many foreign holders of $100 notes in a bad position and also hurt the demand for USD and that would cause their value to drop.
But likely the US gov't will at some point limit the amount of cash that can be used in business transactions.  That is being done in Europe already in some places.
@_date: 2016-12-16 18:03:38
What else are you going to do when Bitcoin is failing in so many ways.  You have to distort the news to make it look better than it is.
@_date: 2016-12-14 16:12:11
Ok good.  To have "Bitcoin" on there would have been wrong.  That's like having "Picasso painting" on the list, instead of collectibles.
Bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency, but it is only one of many and may not even be the dominant one in 5 or 10 years..
Of course anyone can edit Wikipedia (until the lock the page for editing).  I'm sure someone will remove cryptocurrency, but I'll add it back if I see that happen.  I encourage others to do the same.
@_date: 2016-12-06 23:38:58
That's not how markets work.  The market price is the last trade.  So when the next person pays $0.00000000001 for your altcoin, then that is the price and the market cap isn't shit.
@_date: 2016-11-27 10:32:44


No of course you don't have to give your name and address.  You have to supply a name and address.  it obviously doesn't have to be yours.
@_date: 2016-12-14 04:49:14
No it's not good news if you hold bitcoin.  Increasingly draconian, fascist states are not good news, just because the value of your BTC goes up a few USD.
@_date: 2016-12-14 15:57:53
Some are celebrating (foolishly), but most here are finding these increasingly draconian gov'ts to be unsettling and scary.   
And nothing wrong with pointing out that when things go to shit more and more, it's wise to have some of your funds in BTC.
@_date: 2016-11-28 17:03:43
It wouldn't do anything but shave a few hundred $ off the Bitcoin market price.  But we don't care of course because "you can't kill Bitcoin".
@_date: 2016-12-07 00:44:31
Apparently the guys at CoinMarket.com made a horrible mistake and didn't include it in their calculations...can't imagine why that is.
@_date: 2016-12-14 05:47:04

Yes very true.  Women aren't here because they don't want to be here.  They have more important priorities like gossip over who is dating who and where to get their nails done.  Although men have priorities like who is going to throw the ball better than another bunch of millionaires.   But men are here and women aren't and this is an area where men are superior to women.
@_date: 2016-07-01 08:46:27
Biggest threat in my mind is increased regulation.   People love to fantasize about Bitcoin getting so big and popular, but do you really think the gov'ts of the world would allow that to happen? 
Nope they will just regulate it more and ban it if necessary.  There is already a ban on using Bitcoin for purchases in China and if they take that to the next step and ban Bitcoin exchanges there, we would probably be back in the $200s very quickly.
@_date: 2016-07-31 00:30:36
Yes the price is really showing the big surge in Japanese banks buying...all the Chinese buying escaping capital controls too.  That's why the price is going sideways on low volume.
