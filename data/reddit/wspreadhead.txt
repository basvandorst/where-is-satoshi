If I just want to trade crypto (not gonna use fiat), do I need to verify my Bitstamp account?

Thanks for the info

you might wanna post the thread links from 2+2 and BitcoinTalk..

any idea how long it takes to get verified for BTC withdrawal?... currently "verification in process"
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:17:42
awesome! thanks for the help

In the same boat as of 17:00est

serious question... what is the point of this? Just to slow down the blockchain? There's no benefit of doing it, other than for jollies? 
@_date: 2017-03-28 03:57:20
so I received the BTC from Coinbase today, but my bank account has yet to be debited for the purchase... 
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:17:08
I didn't ask you to believe it...
@_date: 2017-01-10 00:14:56
I live near 285, where was this at?

is HitBTC a trustable exchange IYO? I hadn't heard of them until the fork, so I have no clue. I just wanna deposit my BCC, sell them, and then immediately transfer the BTC back to my offline wallet.
@_date: 2016-12-14 00:54:09
any idea how long it takes them to send the 2 amount verifications? going on about 24 hours and nothing...
@_date: 2016-12-16 00:56:42
exactly my question/reasoning! thanks man!
@_date: 2016-12-25 05:20:57
another vote for Coinomi for Android (phone)... I use Electrum for desktop (and my bulk of BTC)... have both paraphrases memorized.  I think I am in good shape

Exodus is crazy today... 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:47:53
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:36:09
I thought it was ElecTRUM not ElecTRON?? did you get phished? :(
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:03:25
no it's not normal, but there IS a huge backlog on the block chain. We just gotta wait it out 
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:16:42
I picked up one, thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:58:43
I have the same question... would I just have to buy another one, and import the 24 word key?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:52:24
I wouldn't get your hopes up... the blockchain has been FUBARed the past 24-36 hours. I wouldn't send any BTC anywhere until the dust settles... but hoping it works out for you just in case LOL
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:56:04
you'll get your BCH (in about a month?) from the BTC you (may have) had in your Coinbase wallet during the fork... surprise!
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:40:43
I know today has been a shitstorm... but you've heard/read about others today sending a trans., and after a long period of time it has yet to even hit the blockchain? (not talking about confirmation)... if so, I feel a little better 
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:04:53
$3200 is the new $4000
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:04:53
$3200 is the new $4000
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:47:36
I've been waiting 48 hours for a confirmation....
@_date: 2016-10-30 05:56:35
yeah, I jumped the gun indeed!
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:27:07
total noob to the BCC thing... I have some BTC in a Coinomi wallet. I know Coinomi supports BCC... so do I need to do anything to get these BCC tokens? Is the only way to get BCC is by selling my BTC (like any other crypto) on a supported exchange? Any info is appreciated
