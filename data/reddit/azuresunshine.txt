First off, the dotcom bubble as a period occured for 5-6 years, not 10. Second, the way you spell the word "bubble" kinda makes your words lose all credibility.

As I've said in my OP, I am a noob indeed, and I would be glad to be corrected or proven wrong. 
In this month alone, however, there has also been a price drop of about $1800, which has eventually corrected itself, just like the previous price drops. Doesn't sound like bubble popping to me. Of course, the price drop must've felt more severe when it went from 1200 to 200 rather than 16k to 14k, but in the grand scheme of things, the chart is still going upwards.

So basically that's the "smart" way of saying "it only has value because people agreed for it to have value", which is literally the same principle by which the dollar exists.

Did it? Last time I checked, the price chart over the years was going steadily upwards. Sure there were fluctuations, some more severe than others, but I wouldn't call that "popping".

So according to you, that's the only criterion which makes something a bubble or not a bubble? 


So the Lightning Network is not an upcoming solution which is being worked on right now, and the public's interest towards bitcoin and the increasing number of places who accept it is not a trend. Nonono. It's pure fucking unsubstantiatied, completely baseless speculation and nonsense. Right. And I'm the dense one. The irony here is really strong.

Gotta love how you casually dodged my question about the definition of "established". And what makes you genius think that bitcoin is not going to be more widely accepted in the future when it's already becoming more and more accepted as a method of payment in many places, especially with the upcoming lightning network which will essentially fix the "long wait, high fees" problem? 
By the way, is the entry requierement for opposing bitcoin to be a condescending asshole?

Lol again dodging questions and spouting personal insults. I'm ending this conversation. Your posts scream "I sold bitcoin when it was $2000 and I'm very angry"
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:30:35
And what the fuck is "intrinsic value" and how do you measure it? What is the intrinsic value of a dollar? How can you confidently say that it is "experiencing rapid growth above its intrinsic value" when you don't even know what the intrinsic value is in the first place? 


Oh right, because the intrinsic value has only ONE criterion which defines it, and of course it is the criterion that fits your narrative. How fucking simple. Sell all your bitcoins, guys, u/malheartsnutmeg has it all figured out.

I assume you mean the dotcom bubble? Well, for one it has existed for roughly 5 years, and bitcoin has been going for almost 9 with an ever-increasing price. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:39:58


Sorry but what do you mean by "established"? Also, "widely accepted" is just a question of time. More and more people are starting to use bitcoin. 


Yep, but a lot of people are buying real estate with the same intent,  and the value of the dollar has to do with that as well. I don't get your point. You can't call something a bubble just because people are buying it in hopes that the value will increase.

Is it? Every black friday this happens. Raise price a couple months in advance, then make a black friday "discount" which is still higher than the initial price. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:12:35
No, it's just that you don't understand the difference between baseless speculation and logical predictions based on ongoing trends. If you don't agree with that, how about you actually give rational explanations for why it's bound to pop/crash now, instead of saying "hurr durr I can't buy some beer with bitcoin so it's a fucking bubble"? Do you even know what store of value means? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:06:15
I'm not saying that it's 100% not a bubble. Repeating what I've already said in the OP - if the so-called bubble hasn't popped in the last 8 years, why would it pop now, when interest towards cryptocurrencies (both of the general public and the powers that be) is at an all-time high? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:04:18
Oh, okay.

There is two (now three) comments under this post and the comment count shows one more. So that's what I assumed.
