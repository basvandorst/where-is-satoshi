IOTA is not only a currency but also a platform for decentralized apps and it introduced a new consensus method that is unlike proof of work. I don't think that you've done enough research on IOTA. I'm not saying it's the next best thing but it's definitely not something that will be rendered obsolete by LN.

First mover advantage is strong but I still think Bitcoin is the MySpace of cryptos. Really good and innovative ideas but some of the other cryptos out there will built on it and surpass the first mover. I still hold some BTC though.

Litecoin looks pretty good as a test net for Bitcoin updates and I think it'll stay here for a while. However I don't think it has a lot of inherent value so I didn't invest in it yet.

Anyone knows what the fees are with the economic option of Breadwallet at the moment ?

Your argument is not based on anything else than numbers. Just because a large number of people feel a certain way doesn't mean their way will be the one and only, hell they might even feel the wrong way. I base my argument on the underlying techs and I hypothesize that some of the other cryptocurrencies out there are building upon Bitcoin's initial great ideas and that one day what is a minority right now will become a majority just like Bitcoin enthusiasts were an irrelevant spec of dust 10 years ago and became a gigantic machine. Another difference between you and me is that I'm making an hypothesis and I am not adamant. I don't claim to know the truth. The consequence is that I hold BTC AND other currencies and if there is a tiny chance that I'm right and BTC is the myspace of cryptos, I will have my back covered.

Exactly, there are not only shitcoins out there. However I think what OP means is that LN will kill most of the shitcoins. Won't kill Ethereum, IOTA, Dash, Monero, Ripple, etc though as those are mostly legit coins. I also just discovered Xtrabytes which looks really promising to me. The technology looks really incredible.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:17:05
It was more of a figure of speech to say that Bitcoin will die if LN doesn't come right now and everyone if this sub feels the urgency.

I will admit that I'm just starting my research. Maybe my point of view will change but I still don't understand why you think that every altcoin has to get obliterated by Bitcoin. Looks to me like Ripple and IOTA are aiming for a different kind of use case and could be viable. Monero looks backed by stronger academic research and arguments than Bitcoin which is more of a software engineering implementation of the concept of Blockchain and is only backed by the whitepaper. I've look up a bunch of abstracts from published peer-reviewed articles on Science Direct and Elsevier and Bitcoin has *some* weaknesses that are adressed by other implementations or modifications.
Anyways, I'll keep an open mind and make my research myself. Have a good one !

As long as mining pool A doesn't have the majority of the computing power, it will never be able to keep up the pace with others mining pool. It might have a leading start but the other mining pools will catch up rapidly and form a longer chain.
I think your question is about what happens when a block is found by a miner. I think what happens is that other miners validate the block by running the hashing function on their own "testing" block with their copy of the transaction record. If it works they go on and look for the next block as yo said.
That's what I understand at least.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:41:56
Anyone care to explain to me what could be the scalability limits of the Lightning Network ? Theoratically will it come to a point when we will need another solution or is it the end all scalability development ?
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:59:54
I know but why would people spend it if they know that if they hold onto it they will have more money in the end ? The point about inflation being a tool to encourage spending and let the economy run correctly seems fair enough to me

Myspace WAS the innovation, AOL WAS the innovatin, Altavista and Inktomi WERE the innovations. Just because there is an innovation somewhere doesn't mean the execution is perfect and can't be topped by some other actor coming later to the party. I know one shouldn't discuss altcoins on this subreddit but some of them are not shitcoins and are backed by academic research and build on Bitcoin's original ideas to provide new insights and implementations. I wouldn't rule out Ethereum, Ripple, IOTA or Monero out of the race just yet, you have to stay open minded and diversify.

I may have been wrong on Monero, I was thinking about another crypto I'll get back to you.
As for the rest, I believe that some altcoins couldn't come as a sidechain because some of their underlying principles are really different. But as I said I'm not informed enough to be adamant, I'll need to complete my research before going any further. I'm just having a conversation :)
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:39:38
This. There is a cryptocurrency bubble and we don't know what cryptocurrency will survive it. Will it be Bitcoin ? Maybe. Depending on the reasons for the bubble burst it might also be Ethereum, Ripple, IOTA or whatever will have the best core mechanics in the context of the crash.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:22:03
I'm not undervaluing in fact it's the first crypto I invested in and it will still grow a lot before before it goes anywhere. I wouldn't be surprised seeing it go to $1M by 2022 if nothing spectacular happens and the adoption rate is really good. Maybe you think I'm some kind of shill or something but you're wrong I'm a rational person and you're not making any argument or responding to mine which is quiet disappointing since we may have learned something from each other.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:19:41
Everyone here is talking about how Lightning network will fix the issue of high fees but the blog post also cites volatility as one of the reasons for the end of Bitcoin support and we all know the volatility is not going anywhere, there will still be huge high and lows.

@_date: 2017-11-21 11:58:31
Fees though ?
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:10:17
I'm just concerned with the fact that BCH tps is now higher than BTC tps and that the BCH price is soaring. If it wasn't for this, I wouldn't worry one bit and would expect BTC to drop to $5,500 before going back up to $8,000 but the circumstances here are quiet disturbing.
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:36:33
The square of number of users is not an exponential function it is a square function or a power function if you want. This is not the logarithmic scale that is weird because as you said it makes total sense. What is weird however is the use of a non linear regression which translates into a polynomial function if you go back to the linear scale. So far the evolution of the price of Bitcoin doesn't look like it's polynomial and feels more like it is exponential as you said. You don't just fit curves because they look pretty on the data, if you want your prediction to be believable, you have to base it on at least a simple underlying assumption like "the evolution of the price of Bitcoin is exponential".

@_date: 2017-11-10 11:49:11
Look at "all time" charts for Bitcoin. Previous corrections have been as big as dropping the price of Bitcoin to ~70% the peak value. According to this history and if the market reacts the same way, it could drop as low as $5,500 before going back up and nothing would be out of line with previous events.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:08:56
I don't understand, they don't drive the platform, they want to change it and don't in the end. How is that an issue ? On the contrary I'd say it shows the strength of bitcoin as it is

Yes, and I don't understand the term 'risk', who's in Bitcoin for short-term really ?
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:53:34
Yes this part of the article is from an interview that dates back to October 18th. One would argue that he wasn't wrong. Bitcoin did reach 'at least $6,000' by 'mid-2018'. 
I think that the interesting part of the article is the figure which shows pretty good agreement between their model and Bitcoin actual price for the past 4 years even on the relatively short term. 
I still prefer a simple linear regression on the past 7 years' data which puts Bitcoin at $1,000,000 before 2024 but it's too empirical to be taken seriously even if the trend has been steady enough.

Thanks for your seemingly objective exposition. It looks to me that with the mindset of hodling, buying before is still the way to go anyway. You say that it would be 'risk(ing) a significant drop in the value of both and loose money'. If my interest is to hodl whatever happens, the prices will continue to go up at some point in one currency or the other and I'll make my money back + whatever the value of the new depreciated currency has become. Maybe you meant loosing money in the sense that I would miss an opportunity to buy after a significant drop at a low price ? 
Hats off to you for your teaching skills !
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:36:44
It does help. It feels like I should learn and read the whitepaper for myself instead of listening to what's being said here or elsewhere. The only sure thing from what I can gather is that the price of Bitcoin *will* keep rising in the months to come.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:12:01
I think it'll go down again.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:05:46
Still better than a wild guess based on the previous price data. Now you're inferring the value of Bitcoin based on something else than the previous value of Bitcoin.

I don't know, I feel like influencing the price of a currency by announcing the creation of a virtually new currency has nothing to do with centralization. You could also see it the other way around: six people decided they didn't want to damage the stability of Bitcoin and that they shouldn't take a decision that isn't unanimous.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:28:55
Don't take anything of what I say for granted this is just my opinion. That being said I guess that even $6,500 would be a good price.
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:56:09
Thanks for your clear explanation. I don't understand why I should get a hardware wallet though. I'm still learning so I don't know why I get downvoted but I have one last question that may seem stupid: as a beginner should I buy rather buy now or after the fork ?

Genkidama incoming guys, prepare to buy the dip !
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:11:29
Because I looked at it from a completely empirical standpoint and saw that despite many obstacles and challenges since Bitcoin's inception, the trend is a steady exponential increase in price. I downloaded the data from Coindesk and put it into Matlab to make a linear regression and looked at he projection up to 2024 and it looks promising long term. Of course I'm not talking about what will happen in one month or two. 
I'm very well aware that this is nothing to be taken too seriously don't worry, empirical predictions like the one I did don't tend to be 100% accurate in the financial sector.
But that combined with the fact that as far as I understand it, Bitcoin isn't even near being used as it could be used ('programmable money', 'alleviate administrative work') makes me comfortable believing that the price will keep rising.
My belief is based on some form of reasoning, sure, but I don't like models that aren't based on a mechanism to explain the results. But with my limited understanding this is the best I can do to make my own decisions.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:29:52
I bet it will go under $6,000 just sit tight and be ready to buy.

A non-linear logarithmic regression is just really weird to be honest. Why would you assume a polynomial evolution of Bitcoin's price in this case ? The choice of a*ln(x) + b seems completely arbitrary and based solely on the look of the curve. A linear logarthmic regression makes more sense because you assume an exponential evolution of Bitcoin's price which sounds closer to what we're seeing so far.

Society exists the way it does thanks to governments. If you believe one second that you would have running water, sewer systems, housing easy access to food, stable work etc. without goverment intervention, you are delusional. It's been like that since the dawn of civilization. The first complex mesopotamian societies existed thanks to governments (kings at the time) ruling and oversight. You benefit from the existence of a government every moment of your life so there are some rules you should abide by. Taxes is one of them. How and how much are people taxed can be discussed but I feel like being taxed by the government is not open for debate. That's my take on it at least.

My message was more of a reference to DBZ but I still think it holds true. It's just a local dip, someone mentioned that it might be because some people are reverting to other alt-coins because they were in BTC just for the fork and get free coins. The SegWit2X cancellation is a strong signal that BTC is stable. No doubt the price will rise after this local dip.
EDIT: needless to say that I'm still a bit mad to have panic bought at $7,200 but hey, now is time to HODL, I'll consider it my first test

@_date: 2017-11-09 12:43:48
I don't think it's enough for people to believe that BCH is a better investment than BTC. 
From my newbie point of view, Bitcoin has a 7-8 years long trend of exponential growth that has remained stable despite people calling the end of Bitcoin several times for various reasons, some rational.
On the other hand, BCH is 3 months old and its value is still very, very volatile. 
I was hesitating on investing a bit in BCH but I guess I'll just put some $10 into it just in case it becomes the new BTC in 10 year and I become a millionaire like some did from buying low value of BTC in 2010, but I'll keep my relatively high value investments in BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:08:10
They calculate a $3 fee to transfer $40 worth of Bitcoin to my wallet. If you want transactions as fast as paying with cash this is the way to go right now. No way you're going to pay a coffee with those fees.
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:40:38
It did help but as a newcomer looking to invest in bitcoin, how do I know if the bitcoins I buy abide by one blockchain or the other ? Do they have the same value ? Or are they just harder to sell ?

Over 9,000
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:37:11
Well now I transfered my $100 to Bread. I decided to do that because I even saw reviewers that complained about the fees that were too low equating to long transactions. I'll give it a try so long that I don't move too much BTC but eventually I'll invest in a Ledger or Trezor.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:56:58
It proves the stability of Bitcoin. It's a strong signal that it's not going anywhere hence why you should invest in it, hence why the price is rising
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:25:40
Yes I wouldn't call that a correction, it's more of a random noise before the big dip. Look at the peak between August and October. We would currently be in the first stage of the drop. I'd expect the price to drop a lot more in the next 5-10 days or so.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:59:25

@_date: 2017-11-11 13:01:26
I disagree. There *is* a long-term identifiable trend for Bitcoin that has been sustained for 7 years. There are some reasonable arguments that can be made on the future price of Bitcoin both mid-term and long term. Of course nothing is sure but you can make sane decisions in crypto. Might not be the best way to become a millionaire, but it sure as hell is the best way to avoid becoming broke.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:20:03
My guess is that it will drop a lot more in the coming 5-10 days. I place my bet on a $6,500, maybe event a $6,000 dip ($5,500 if we look at the best scenario from BTC lifecyle). Wait a bit more to buy.
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:25:12
So just to be clear, if I buy $100 worth of Bitcoin on Coinbase today and keep them there, I WILL get the matching amount of B2X after the fork right ?
What's the fastest service to get Bitcoin from ? I'd like my coins to land on my account before the fork.
If I want to transfer them to a hardware wallet down the line, will it be easy to do (Trezor wallet for example) ?

Linear regression based on 7 years of data places stable $10,000 somewhere around March, 2018 if the trend stays the same. 
However judging by the tendency of BTC to spike and dip, it might very well be the case that Bitcoin reach $10,000 before Christmas before dropping some 20-30% and people calling it doomed to fail again.

I'm sorry but your assumption is wrong

I don't know, what makes you say gold will be as valuable as it is now in 20 years? Gold is not being used that much anymore, materials engineers found a ton of replacement. I don't know...

So I just bought ~$100 worth on Bitcoin. They're currently on a french Bitcoin bank (Paymium). Should I keep them there ? Is it worth it to invest in a software or hardware wallet or should I wait to have more BTC ?
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:01:16
I couldn't find the exact formula written down. It is  *sqrt(# adresses) x (transaction volume per adress)* right ?
I don't understand the *volume per account* bit, how does it correlate with the average transaction value ? What transactions is he talking about ? USD to BTC ? Alt-coin to BTC ? Both ?  Algebraically ? Do you have any peer-reviewed source for Metcalfe's law ?

Right now it's not more worrying than any previous correction. However it is true that BCH is rising (+34%)

With all that being said, what's a better websie than Coinbase to buy Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:40:07
Do they pay taxes or are they self sustaining, abiding by their own laws and completely off the grid (not using any resource or infrastructure provided by the government ?

Do you know which one of these exchanges is available in France ?

I've already read the answer to this question on the other subreddit and read extensive comments and blog posts calling out the censorship on this sub so as i stated I already have the other perspective, but thanks :)

My only regret is to be a student and not have any more money to invest in crypto. Cheers to everyone for passing this milestone !

Why is Bitcoin suddenly so much harder to mine ?

Methodology ? Also how do you know this is the real floor ?
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:38:52
I seriously wish I could buy more but I'm just a student with limited funds :( Just bought $30 more when it was at $5,900
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:41:46
I think it's going to $5,500.

What ? I didn't get your message sorry...

This is crypto as in cryptography, not crypticurrencies. It doesn’t even support the signing algorithms used by major crypticurrencies. Stop being so desperate.

A few more questions left unanswered for me, thanks a lot to the people who answered my previous ones.
1) I was really unsure of which mobile wallet to use so I created many to see which interface I liked the most. Turns out they're all the same. Which one should I use for $100 worth of Bitcoin in your opinion: Blockchain, Bread, Bitcoin.com ? Bread doesn't seem to have 2 factor identification which is not really good iirc
2) What fees should expect transferring from Paymium to my mobile wallet ? From mobile wallet to a different mobile wallet ? From a mobile to a hardware wallet ?
Thanks again !
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:24:43
Give a break to what ? It's the first time I'm asking a question related to that, I'm new in this subreddit and this is a legitimate question. If all you can tell a newcomer inquiring about allegations is "give it a break!" you're not convincing anybody. I'm asking because I only saw one side of the coin (the allegations) and no response to it. I don't like seeing only one side.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:37:29
Didn't see that coming. I panic bought at 7600 for fear of the price rising fast because of the cancellation and now its at 7330 ffs. Anyway, now is the time to hold still. HODL whatever happens, it will rise again for sure.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:39:25
Yes, nothing out of line with what happened previously in the history of Bitcoin. I think it could drop as low as $6,000 which means cheap coins. After that it'll go up above $8,000 before mid-December.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:05:02
I would spend it on Bitcoin and HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:09:51
No, Coinbase has only one layer of account verification (in my case the ID card has been successfully verified) while GDAX has two. So when I try to log in to GDAX with my Coinbase credentials, it asks me to verify something else (passport, driver's license or another thing) with the webcam...
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:45:55
Why did you buy BTC in the first place. I also bought at $7,600 thinking it would keep going up and up but now that it got down I don't see this (when will it hit $8,000) being a legitimate concern... 
I made a linear regression of the data available since mid-2011. If the trend keeps going the same way it did, will hit $8,000 before the end of the year and $20,000 by 2019. Just hold.
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:13:07
Don't make the same mistake I did. I bought at 7600 yesterday, now it's at 7000. I'd say wait one or two more days to see the trend stabilized.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:55:37
The authentification code is temporary and  you also need it to confirm transactions or change account information if I'm not mistaken.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:48:04
I also looked at Paymium which is a french company. It might be a plus since I'm in France, I might try to go with them.

 Predict a correction to $7,000 short after it hits 10,000.
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:15:25
Yes we did.

Should we be worried ?
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:52:05
I don't scoff at $1,000,000 but $10,000,000 ??? This can't be !!!
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:02:03
Please someone tell me where I can buy BTC and transfer them to my wallets without paying non nonsensical fees ?! I have 40€ worth of Bitcoin that I bought on Coinbase and they want to send it for 3€ fees even though transactions with 0.10€ fees get confirmed !
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:46:43
Previous all-time peaks in the history of BTC were followed by a drop at ~75% de value. The last peak was $7,800. If the market reacts in the same manner (mindset haven't changed much since last peaks), I'm confident it will at least drop to $6,400. I'm just waiting a bit more to buy, see if I'm right. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:54:56
I second this question
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:51:03
Don't you worry it'll go up eventually
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:41:37
Since the number of businesses using bitcoin at the potential described in the videos (reduce administrative work, delays, improve automation via bitcoin programmation, use of bitcoin units to represent something else than money etc.), can we safely say that if there is a bubble, it is really really far from bursting ?
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:44:45
By linear regression estimates based on the past 7 years of data using an two parameters exponential model of growth, it won't reach $500,000 by mid-2022 if the trend stays the same. He better get ready.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:41:58
I think it will drop even more, you'll have another opportunity.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:06:12
I often go over peer-reviewed material in my field of study and I still print the important articles. It's much more easier to work with when you're trying to grasp the concepts. You can go from page 8 to page 21 faster, make notes and re-read them more easily. I bet anyone working in academia will tell you the same thing. It's pretty much the same things as e-books versus real books. I like reading novels on my Kindle, but I would never buy a math textbook for it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:11:53
Divisible up to 8 decimals.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:06:05
Even with the low fee settings ?
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:17:53
I submitted but let's be real here. If you're buying a coffee and want to have a short confirmation time, the fees will cost the price of the coffee.
EDIT: lol I don't know why I'm being downvoted. I'm a Bitcoin hodler myself but seriously, Coinbase is asking me for a $3 fee to transfer $40 worth of Bitcoin. Quit being completely oblivious, supporting Bitcoin is not the same as *blindly* supporting it. Maybe I'm mistaken but explain it to me in a rational manner instead of just downvoting.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:10:25
Hi everyone,
I'm a newcomer to the Bitcoin world, I've been reading a lot the past few days on this sub and elsewhere on the internet. Before investing in it, I wanted to see for myself what the trend was like.
Turns out that based on the available data on Coindesk since 2011 and using a least square method for linear regression, if the average trend keeps going the way it did for the past 7-8 years, Bitcoin might hit $1,000,000 before 2024 !
Needless to say that between this result and the Segwit2x cancellation, I didn't hesitate for to long before buying myself some coins !
Plot was made using Matlab. Of course this is nothing to be taken as a fact. There is the strong assumption that the trend will stay the same. It's not a stupid assumption since it has been the same trend for 8 years but still, only time will tell how things will really evolve.
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:25:27
Thanks for the info !
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:29:00
It is my understanding that the creator of Bitcoin has a huge portion of Bitcoins. What would happen if he were to exchange it for something else or withdraw it as cash?
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:11:23
So you're not grateful for everything I cited ? As bad as your life may seem to you, you'd take it in the blink of an eye over something that might be far more complicated and dangerous. I don't like everything in our society but I wouldn't reject it like you did.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:54:42
Shit, looks like I should buy fast before the price explodes over 10K
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:32:24
I don't think it will go as low as $4,000. Maybe $5,500 but $4,000 would really go against previous dips consistency.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:20:24
Not sure with all the pending transactions of people trying to cash out
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:22:48
That's what I understood but I'm talking about software wallets. The value of the bitcoins I have right now is inferior to the price of Trezors and Ledgers, I'd like to keep it in a mobile wallet for now
