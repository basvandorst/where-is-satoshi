Pathetic.... "I decided to support them?" You mean "I decided they should buy my coins"?. Greece does not need Bitcoin. They need to start getting their act together. Create a functioning tax system, a smaller government, work a decent time a day and don't start with pension at 62 and put an end to the widespread corruption. They made a mess of their economy and now they need help? Fuck them, they already received way more help than they deserve.

I don't think buttcoiners want bitcoin to fail. Why would they? Most of them are just mocking at the cult like bitcoin community with their "to the moon", "this is Sparta, HODDDDDL!!!", "We have a war to fight" bullshit. Personally i think bitcoin is a genious invention and a brilliant concept....but not for the average Joe. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 10:43:06
Your question is exactly pointing out why Bitcoin will not go mainstream. It has no advantage for the average Joe. Why transfer dollars (or other fiat) into Bitcoin and use it to buy common stuff you can also buy directly with dollars. Plus the fact that with the current volatility your just bought Bitcoin might have less value the moment you want to spent it.
If you are into drugs or are a pedophile it might come in handy...

@_date: 2014-10-24 07:28:25
Because the average Joe does not care for Bitcoin. For most people Bitcoin does not offer any advantages compared to paying with a credit card, paypall etc. Why go through the hassle of converting fiat into bitcoin to buy stuff you can also buy with fiat. Plus on a bad day to find out that your just bought bitcoin has lost 20% of it's value... 
@_date: 2014-11-28 14:47:27

This comparison completely fails. When the internet started there was nothing that came even close. Bitcoin is (amongst others) just a method of payment. There are  a dozen ways to pay nowadays. To most people bitcoin does not offer anything new. The internet changed the way we communicate, the way we shop, the way we gather information, the way we work etc. etc. Bitcoin will never do that.
@_date: 2014-10-24 12:51:12

Couple of comments: 
Not all bitcoins are allocated to a public adress. That only goes for the mined bitcoins.
Bitcoin cannot be hacked? That might be true but also mentioning that wallets and exchanges can be (and are) hacked resulting in the theft of bitcoins every day makes it a more balanced story.
I miss critical notes in this doc. You might want to mention that the whole value increase is not really going as planned which makes mining less and less attractive which is a serious problem for the network. Possible 51% attacks are also not mentioned. I you want to really inform people you should tell the whole story in my view.
Also the still existing volatility does not make it very usefull as a currency.

You guys really make me laugh with your "this is Sparta!!!" type of bullshit. Bitcoin is doing nothing but function the way it was programmed. The Bitcoin community might feel like they are doing great and heroic things from their shady basements but in fact they have not achieved much so far.

1) You buy them using fiat money and then hodl them until the moon rocket is flying. The you sell them for fiat and will be insanely rich.
2) Store them on a paper wallet, then make a copy of that paper wallet, scan it and store it on a usb-stick. Stick that usb-stick up your ass and keep it there until the event mentioned under 1 takes place.
3) Can someone convince you that Santa is actually real and that Egypt is in fact an island?

I absolutely love buttcoin you are right about that but i have a very broad world view. I get the feeling that you are just frustrated that i am not all over the moon about bitcoin like you are. I absolutely see how extremely clever Satoshi Nakamoto solved the Byzantine General's problem with his proof of work but i don't see bitcoin as a working solution. It is a very interesting experiment but it just has to many flaws. You must have many friends if this is your general response to people you disagree with.

@_date: 2015-07-27 11:06:51
I am getting a bit tired of the continuing comparison with the internet. The internet opened a whole new world, a world full of applications that did not exist before. Bitcoin is offering a solution to a problem most people simply don't have. And apart from that it is not sustainable, not user friendly and extremely slow which makes it not fit for day to day use by the average Joe. If you want to make a comparison you should compare bitcoin with gunpowder after dynamite was invented. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 13:33:55
What i meant to say is that the internet brought a whole lot of new applications like; video conferencing, online gaming, online chatting, gambling, shopping etc. etc. Bitcoin is a payment method that does not need a trusted third party like a bank. In that sense it is new but in the end (and to the average Joe) it's just a payment method like there already are dozens. (paypall, creditcards, debitcards etc.) but without any guarantees or insurances and already tarnished by a lot of scams and scandals. At the moment the only people using bitcoin are libertarians (because they don't like banks or the establishment in general), people that want to purchase illegal stuff on darkmarkets (drugs, childpornography etc) or tech savvy people such as yourself because they are fascinated by the underlying blockchain algorithm. There might never come a phase where this will be different for bitcoin. However, i do see useful applications for the blockchain.

VAT on costs is only deductible as far as the costs are made for taxable output. If all your output is VAT exempt; sale of bitcoins or running a bitcoin exchange, you cannot deduct any VAT so you have to include the non deductible VAT in your costbase. If you both provide taxable and exempt services you will have a pro-rata deduction right. For example most banks cannot recover more than about 10% of incurred VAT. So the paradox of a VAT exemption is that if you incur a lot of VAT on external costs your product will be more expensive than without an exemption. VAT exemptions only work out as they should (lower prices for end consumers) if not much VAT is incurred on costs. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 15:15:43
I hope all those start up companies do realize that being exempt also means that incurred VAT on investments is also fully not deductible. Being exempt is not perse a good thing fiscally spoken.

Can you explain what is ridiculous about this story? It's a given fact that the biggest bitcoin adoption can be found within the pedophile and darknetusers population.
@_date: 2015-04-23 14:29:49
Of course it is legit. So far there have not been any scams with Bitcoins involved. Bitcoin is money for free and honest people.

I find the troubles at Bitpay a better measure of adoption...Too bad they already ended their sponsorship of the St. Petersburg Bowl. Adoption has completely stalled and nobody is paying with bitcoin.

Just re-sell it to a greater fool! In other words just apply the practice the whole Bitcoin "economy" is based on.

You forgot; 6. After Greece this is a great new opportunity to pump the price and let's hope it works this time! 
@_date: 2015-04-10 07:25:47
You don't have any use for Bitcoin just like 99% of the people. That's why Bitcoin is not taking off. Mass adoption only happens if people see a benefit something existing cannot offer.

It will make you filthy rich! Just plug it in and it will generate a never ending stream of bitcoins!
I have 50 of those little gems running and will soon retire from my job at 35.

No, i live in a rather big house. I am not sure what you are trying to say with all these warning posts? All kinds of institutions and journalist have warned potential investors for the extreme volatile nature and risks of Bitcoin, that is true.
But there are also a lot of warnings ventilated against the abuse of drugs, alcohol etc. Does that mean that people are afraid of it? Same goes for Bitcoin. I would say those warnings are not a good sign and don't mean that Bitcoin is a big thing, a big risk maybe. If you look at market share, userbase, transactions volumes it is a neglectable phenomenon at the moment. I am not saying that the Bitcoin blockchain technology is not briljant or useable. I am just saying it does not have a big impact at the moment and that is mostly because bitcoin does not offer one advantage for the average Joe compared to other payment methods. I do admit that i have to laugh at the reaction of CoinMarketSwot; he is exactly showing why i love this sub so much. I do not want to believe in his  fairytale and now i can't have an academic degree. Priceless toddler reaction!

You do have a bit of an obsession with trolls don't you? Have you been butt raped by one of them? Where is all that anger coming from? I hope you realize that trolls (as you call them) don't really care about the price. They just troll because people like you really believe they are paid shills and you come up with these nice delusional and paranoid reactions. Trolling is no fun when the victim replies in a normal way....Apart from that would a troll really be messed up if the price is going up with 10 bucks after a steady decline of 900 bucks? Get real my man.
@_date: 2015-02-09 12:00:03
No, it will just means that more miners will go belly up.

I am a male. I have an academic degree. My IQ is somewhere around 150 and i am very happy. The reason i visit this sub and post on it now and then is because i just like a good cultish freak show. What i also like is to watch the cognitive dissonance that is displayed on this sub in it's purest form. I could also go to the Justin Bieber sub which displays basically the same emotions but the postings there are done by hormonally unstable girls so they more or less have an excuse. The postings on this sub are done by educated adults which makes it more fascinating. I don't believe there is one paid shill around in this sub. Why would any organization pay to discredit Bitcoin? It is a very small an meaningless phenomenon that has not disrupted anything. Besides, the Bitcoin community, hackers, scammers and incompetent exchanges do more than enough to discredit Bitcoin. Nobody in it's right mind is stepping in anymore.   
@_date: 2015-02-11 16:23:12
I totally agree! But those are the ones that get the best reactions!
It is kind of addicting to see how far you can go. I find it amazing that some people post a serious/angry/frustrated reply on a post that is indeed totally retarded. Maybe i should see a shrink but i love it!
@_date: 2015-02-24 09:52:02
Don't worry and don't cry. The next scam will come along sooner than you think. There will always be exciting new opportunities to get rid of your money.

Has nothing to do with Bitcoin? Really??? It might as well be the only reason bitcoin still exists. Some whales that are trying to squeeze the last bucks out of a broken system. And on the sidelines the desparate baghodlers watch and wait for the inevitable price jump to the moon... thinking they are the only ones who understand the system and future of bitcoin...Bitcoin; turning nerds into business analysts since 2009!
@_date: 2015-02-09 11:42:31
Fantastic idea! Let's suppose that Greece leaves the Euro and starts using the Drachme again. Given the dramatic economy of Greece the Drachme would take an instant nose dive against the Euro or the USD. Of course all their debts are still in Euro so that helps....Then how the fuck would backing a crappy valuta with another crappy valuta (Bitcoin) is going to help here? Bitcoin is so volatile that nobody in his right mind wants it as a currency. What would it even mean to back a currency with a commodity that has no intrinsic value? The major problems of Greece are that they have a shitty economy and that nobody is paying taxes. You don't solve that with some tweeking of your currency. It is sometimes unbelievable how little you guys understand from the real economy.

Wow, just WOW!!! I had to cry when i red your amazing story. Without bitcoin you would have died man. Stories like this prove that bitcoin has so much to offer that cannot be achieved otherwise. Keep posting awesome stories like this and people will start to adopt Bitcoin.

Bitcoin; turning nerds into business analyst since 2009!! Everytime i see a post like this I almost shit my pants with laughter! Bitcoin is the perfect solution for a non-existing problem, hence the unstoppable mass adoption that is taking place!

Sure, i have 5 modified toasters mining for me 24/7 and make about 100k a day. With an investment of around 200 USD you can be a millionaire in two weeks. That's why everybody is doing it. It's the foolproof method to get rich quick.

Sell them as fast as i could.
@_date: 2015-02-03 07:50:05
You do know that 50% of all Bitcoins are owned by less than 1000 people right? But still you believe that the price is determined by the hundreds of thousands of traders that all buy fractions. That's really cute.
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:57:27
No way, we are going to dive under 200 again. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 12:18:28
It is potentially disruptive, i totally agree but it's not yet. A lot will have to change before that happens. Satoshi has solved the Byzantine Generals Dillema and i give him full credit for that because it is briljant. To transform that into a useable system that is stable, easy to use and sustainable is another thing. At this moment Bitcoin has several flaws that makes it unattractive for "normal" people. Also the general opinion on Bitcoin has been damaged a lot by all the scams and hacks. I am certain that we will use (crypto) digital currencies in the future but i doubt whether bitcoin will make it big. Just my opinion.
@_date: 2015-02-11 21:39:45
Neither of them; it's a very volatile commodity at best.
@_date: 2015-02-18 21:50:00
Apple pay of course. Apple is a highly regarded innovative and trusted company. Bitcoin is tarnished with all the scandals, scams and hacks. To be succesful you need the avarage Joe on board. The average Joe has ipads, ipods, iphones etc, so it's a small step to use Apple pay. To use Bitcoin is a bridge too far for most people.
@_date: 2015-02-09 15:31:51
Yeah, so in short; Average Joe does not want Bitcoin. That is not really an eyeopener....
@_date: 2015-02-04 16:44:15
With the  ongoing price decline, the total lack of mass adoption and all the scams and scandals i don't really think any bank or government is worried about Bitcoin. Why should they be afraid of something so small and meaningless? 
@_date: 2015-02-20 08:03:47
I don't understand that either, why worry if you only get 1 or 2 bitcoin payments a year. I would understand it if the majority of customers would pay in bitcoin but that will never be the case.
@_date: 2015-02-13 10:29:54
I bet you do have a lot of succes with the ladies... Classical uber-rational nerd response... "I don't get it; let's blame it on emotions..those nasty feelings i don't have."
Even if i am not being emotional. I am just making fun of you... 
@_date: 2015-02-13 09:38:04
Nope, this is called a pump which will soon be followed by a dump...
@_date: 2015-02-06 07:49:20
This might very well be the turning point! Mass adoption is happening people, we just don't see it yet. If bitcoin is on your mind because of a verdict that is still good for bitcoin. All the attention for the MtGox debacle and Bitstamp hack were also good for bitcoin! There is no such thing as bad publicity! 
@_date: 2015-02-06 12:30:16

We are comparing a function which is a payment system. We are not comparing a company and a protocol. Microsoft and Sony are two completely different companies too but it makes perfect sense to compare the Xbox and the Playstation. Same example. Do you really think that the average user cares whether he can participate in the innovation?? Get real. I have never ever heard somebody say "i don't buy Sony tv's because they don't let you participate in their innovation. What a joke of an argument for Bitcoin. I would think the opposite; average Joe might find the whole open source thing suspicious
