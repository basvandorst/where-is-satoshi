Well, the experiment is officially over. Selling everything today. RIP Bitcoin, it was a good run.

Okay...I'm asking what you'd do in my shoes buddy. I make about 40k per year at my job after taxes, so I'll most likely have another 30k or so by the time I'm ready to buy another house or rent an apt.

3,000 down and the paid maybe 20k in interest? I dunno. I know roughly 10,000 was knocked off the principle in those 5 years. But I mean, it sure beats paying rent for 5 years and having nothing to show afterwards.

What is Bitcoin Cash selling for on Coinbase (I can't see the unit price) and what is it actually worth according to other exchanges?

SELL NOW BEFORE THE FOURTH WATER COMPARTMENT IN THE TITANIC FILLS UP
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:17:57
Yes. Buy now or you will regret it. 50/50 BTC and alt coins
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:27:45
Like, say I buy a whole bitcoin right now at 16.5k or whatever. Do you guys legit believe it will go to at least 30-35k? I'd be happy to cash out then and there and enjoy that 100% return.

Bitcoin going down faster than a hooker at a stag party

Bought my house in 2012 for 85k. Just sold it for 155k, walked away with about 70k. Is that a good return? And how much of that 70k should I invest in crypto? I'm going to stay with my parents for a year or so, so I'd like that money to go to work for me the best way possible.

Or Bitcoin is just actually dying 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:08:18
Maybe. Pics? Twink type preferred.

Too many fools putting too much of their money into crypto. I've got maybe a couple grand in, which is &lt;1% of my net worth. This means nothing to me.

Dilly dilly!
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:31:14
Thanks man I appreciate it. I've got maybe a couple grand to pay off on credit cards but other then that debt free, and a semester away from finishing my masters. Sucks about the no good sister in law. I'd make her pay rent if I were you.

10K INCOMING

Honestly, I just wanna make bank, get tons of ass and drive a Range Rover.

Just took out a second mortgage on my house and purchased a whole bitcoin. Is it true that it will be worth $1,000,000 dollars in a few years??
