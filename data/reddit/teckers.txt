Taxi drivers and pubs were starting to accept bitcoin, micro payments were possible. The whole thing has no proper real world legal use anymore behind greed and speculation. And no I dont care if I get banned for saying this.

huh? No, its built into the protocol and is (re)set automatically after a number of blocks have been mined. The faster the last batch of blocks gets mined, the higher the diff goes, if blocks are taking too long, diff goes down. 
Have a look here to see it in action:

My point exactly, except for the creative industries and service industries(?), it would be hard to prove examples I would think, esp. in manufacturing.

Yeah I was working for someone and yes it was a one time order. I wasn't the one to pull the trigger so I don't know exactly how they were paid in the end, I just sourced it and handled some emails. All I know is they delivered something amazing (3m tall inflatable sheep, don't ask why...)

Sorry I should have clicked on the screenshot, v.interesting. Just out of interest, have you plotted mentions against the coin price over the last few months? that will be something worth watching I think.

I'm guessing it was a white hole
@_date: 2013-05-08 23:55:37
Put it this way, would you keep your bitcoin in an uninsured bank if you had a lot of it, or would you accept a 2.5% fee that would guarantee with a trusted 3rd party?
@_date: 2013-05-08 23:35:50
That sounds great, hope it all works out.

Spend a year writing something and all you get from that forum is silly nit-picking comments. Thats got to be rough dude.
@_date: 2013-05-09 22:17:18
yes but they can instantly be sold for far more, so its very unlikely

Thanks, great link. Lots of downloads in germany since the positive TV spot as well it seems.

well yes of course...
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:14:56
Yes this is a very good comparison, Western Union business model is blown apart by bitcoin technology just like Kodak film was with digital. Kodac didn't adapt because of complacency and denial, it seemed to not WANT to understand that people no longer needed or desired film. There is a good chance that if Western union doesn't get a handle on bitcoin quickly they too will slowly slide into obsolescence.
@_date: 2013-06-06 12:23:14


No, thats just speculation, there is no real evidence of this, defiantly not *certain* proof. They could be completely disinterested or indifferent.

@_date: 2013-05-06 09:35:52
We might get the point where breaking it up is less bad then trying to hold it together. I dont think we are quite there yet, It will be a mess if it happens.
@_date: 2013-05-07 17:33:45
Or they think Bitcoin has a chance of being a success. Therefore if it becomes widely popular in China first before other countries, there is a potential for massive wealth transfer. The Chinese people will now hold the (rapidly deflating) coins the rest of the world want. 
I don't know if this is remotely plausible, just saying.
@_date: 2013-11-11 01:10:17
I love it, but part of me wants the map to look like pandemic so I can sit back and watch bitcoin infecting countries one by one..
@_date: 2013-05-09 22:59:44
No, I really think they cant ever be reliably transferred without the internet, thats the main reason bitcoin wont 'take over' from fiat money I believe. 
I can still go places locally with no phone coverage, and so no internet, and so bitcoin wont work. I cant imagine anywhere where my national currency wont work, and even internationally I suspect US Dollars will work, or can easily transferred to something that will even in a war zone. 
Powercut = no money. Those carefully paper stored bitcoin in your safe will be no use even to buy basics, unlike a stash of notes.
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:23:12
Well that may start to answer some of the ~~brainless~~ shortsighted "but bitcoin is useless because I cant pay my rent with it" comments
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:24:31
yeah, but that isnt as easy as selling a hundred quids worth when you pop in for a pint of milk.
@_date: 2013-07-17 02:00:46
haha thanks, i will pass on the love to someone else, hadn't got around to using the tipbot before, now i will have to i guess :) 
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:26:35
That isn't end to end unless someone made the steel for bitcoin, then sold it to the nut-and-bolt maker for bitcoin, who then made them in a nut-and-bolt factory with bitcoin-bought equipment + energy and bitcoin-paid workers, then sold them on for bitcoin. 
I could go on, nuts and bolts don't just appear.
@_date: 2013-06-06 12:50:01
I agree, those are all fair points, I just think its too early to tell for sure what they want to do with bitcoin. I don't think this was your intention, but bitcoin hyperbole only serves to fuel another bubble.

Almost anything can be insured, there are specialist markets and syndicates. Thats like saying who do you think would insure my life? after all i'm guaranteed to die.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:24:12
Another reason: the only time I have been directly involved in ordering something direct from a chinese factory, they wanted the money sent via western union to avoid taxes. Bitcoin will take a lot of the market for slightly dodgy international transfers I think.
@_date: 2013-06-01 15:15:01
I think its better to say bitcoin *might* do for the banking industry what filesharing did for the recording industry. (e.g. turn the industry from being insanely rich, parasitical and greedy, into a far leaner business model less intent on ripping off everyone they can.)
@_date: 2013-07-30 15:01:54

This is actually really depressing, It seems to me wealth inequality wont be any different if Bitcoin is a success.

Well I dont mean to be ungrateful but.... that one actually didn't tip me because of a typo.
@_date: 2013-11-12 11:13:27
I dont like it, I think you misunderstood why the original worked so well. It's because it WAS original, and awesomely shitty. This it a copycat idea without the eye catching style. 
Sorry if I sound harsh but you did ask and I have crit a shit-ton of designwork in my time so I dont mess about anymore.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:17:38
Cool! love these new stats, there is a definite link as I suspected, but hard to tell which is driving, if this gets buried post again because this IS interesting.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:12:52
it was a semi-serious question, dont you use facebook stats instead?
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:00:26
It was a pretty bad debate but I still think we have come a long way. Newsnight is THE main serious news/political discussion platform for the BBC. Each time they touch on bitcoin it's a little more informed than the last.
@_date: 2013-05-09 22:15:20
I'm pretty sure you will find he isnt...
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:40:46
Well this is true, but to be fair bitcoin itself WAS very US/UK focused. I got into coin just before the April bubble and even since than I have seen the ballooning interest in China become the main driver of price rises, and Chinese ASIC manufacturing becoming a volume industry.
@_date: 2013-10-21 10:48:18
You would think it would be more prudent to accept donations in whatever legal form that come. Very stuffy attitude is typical wikipedia.
@_date: 2013-05-08 23:18:37
I think you should rethink this. It would be very useful to have bitcoins stored with insurance, and be able to have an account that also acts as an integrated exchange, being able to hold and switch between currencies easily. I am sure people use existing exchanges for this (a place to hold bitcoin AND fiat) but they are not really fit for this purpose.
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:59:32
oh man, you really didnt have to do that haha, thanks
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:50:19


Has anybody tried to do the blockchain analysis yet? It would be interesting to get a rough idea if we can.
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:20:27
No, if enough people believe in bitcoin only a crash and burn, or obsolescence by a far far better coin (nothing is on the horizon at the moment) will prevent this, regulation might slow it. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 11:20:40
More than risky, its incredibly stupid, you are opening the site to potential US legal jurisdiction. See the case of [Richard O'Dwyer]( who the US sought to extradite despite never hosting anything there. Also see the takedowns of various gambling sites (cant be bothered to find links right now)

An all bitcoin economy is an unrealistic model, fiat currency (or gold bars) can be used without power supply or internet access, they will always be used alongside bitcoin.

Yeah I agree, I am interested in any Bitcoin coverage in the 'serious' financial press, even if it is negative. This is a crap piece, but the fact it is in Forbes makes it interesting due to the readership it will reach, and the influence it may have.
@_date: 2013-07-16 22:46:12
Oh wow, this is generous to the extreme, happy cake-day internet bitcoin stranger :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:21:59
No credit card fees: they work out about about 1-3% of purchase price.
Also, No extra exchange rate fees for buying oversees.
Potentially legally avoid tax if you are trading purely in bitcoin. (not saying this is necessarily a good thing for society, but good for an individual)
No need to rely on your bank actually working (software causing outages)
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:43:38
good stuff, bit i'm still waiting for the 'risk' and 'pandemic' style skins to make it epic.
@_date: 2013-06-05 08:46:23
It wont stop bitcoin, it will just make bitcoin harder to use in the US. There is a whole world out there you know? When prohibition was introduced the rest of the world still drank.

Well they tried to get my address and wanted a minimum of $5 so they don't really 'get' bitcoin yet, but I managed to donate 50c tip just to show them goodwill.

Any chance we can have an option to lock an account to withdraw to only one address Doog? TFA is great but not always practical
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:39:50
Its been answered but let me add:
Web wallet fine until your coins are worth more than your weekly disposable spending money, then you need to store on your computer using multibit and/or electrum.
Multibit/electrum fine until your coins are worth more then the computer they are stored on, then you need cold storage.
Cold storage fine until it become the most valuable item in your house, then you need a fireproof safe or two.
Safes are fine until they become more valuable than your actual house, then you need encrypted paper wallets in multi safety deposit boxes.

Great post, but the good news there was over 600 bitcoin downloads [just this last 7 days in Brazil]( so it would seem your guess of 1000 users in total is underestimating.
