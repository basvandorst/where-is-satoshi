Thanks. It has certainly been stressful at times, with so much money on the line.
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:27:09
Lol! A dude's gotta sleep sometimes.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:04:14
I used to give out $1 or $2 worth all the time, but high tx fees have really dissuaded me from doing that. Some of the people I gave the $1 to now have $60!!
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:54:26
At times, absolutely maddening. At the worst I would go on IRC and pick fights.
Now I am relieved that there have been and will be forks, and people will have a choice. I hold coins on all sides of the forks. I don't want to gamble.
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:08:48
I hold, of course. My strategy is to buy and sell only when I am happy with either price outcome. If I just sell 10% of my BTC and there is a massive correction / bear market, I can buy back in lower and make a nice profit. If I sell 10% of my BTC and the price doubles, I am happy as well.
For the fork, who knows? I wouldn't be surprised if Bitcoin revisited $2,500 or lower on very bad news from Governments, or goes well past $10,000 if the fork goes well and adoption keeps increasing.
If you feel compelled to trade, just do it with a small percentage of your holdings, like 10%. That is my advice.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:02:16
Especially when the price finally found the bottom.

Agree 100%.
I think buying frivolously can actually be negative, not just not positive. The way the economy is structured, buying most things causes negative externalities that hurt people somewhere else on the planet. It's disguised at 'economic growth', but that is only because the GDP and other measuring sticks are woefully inadequate. Hopefully blockchains can help address these shortcomings in the long run. 
Edit - And I mean 'not positive' not just for the world, but for the buyer, because I think most people,  deep down, understand this, even if subconsciously.
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:21:17
Good for you!
I didn't highlight in my story, but I think what many people miss is that for someone entering in 2012, it still took money to make money, so to say. I didn't have thousands of coins for 'nothing'. I put thousands of dollars into just a few hundred coins. I am curious what might have been different for me if I had bought the coins at $1 each and not at an average of around $30.
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:17:42
Closer to 250 BTC, but if I converted my ETH, USD profits and small amount of Alts to bitcoin, It would total about 340 btc, which is just about as many as I originally bought back in 2012 / 2013.
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:13:55
At the risk of seeming heartless: No.
I hope you are happy with your current circumstances, and if you are not, I wish you success in changing them to you satisfaction.
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:08:24
I expect I will sell coins after they have increased in value from here, and as I find other worthy investments for the money. If Bitcoin retains the same properties as it does today, I will also always hold some coins. It's pretty nice have wealth in the form of BTC, under my direct control :)
How will I help the world? However I most effectively can. I am still learning and thinking about I can use the money to help. Appropriate investments can both help and give good returns, creating an expanding cycle of influence.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:51:06
I like my job, but it is no well-paying career to brag about. At this point, if all crypto went to $0, I would still have about $700k in other assets left. Some of that $700k is from cashing out crypto, but a majority is from saving and other successful investments.
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:31:46
Yes. I feel guilty when I think about how my government will spend the money, but I chose the 'immoral thing' rather than living in fear of being caught.
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:57:50
Yes. 
I don't want to go into detail here though.
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:12:58
Yes, I do live quite frugally, and I am not personally limited by money at this point. As a human, I still have my limits. There is only so much time in a day, I can only be one place at once, there is an infinite amount I do not know, I have only a certain amount of intelligence and skills. Money can't really change those things, only me. The money does give me the freedom to work to maximize my own potential though, and for that I am grateful.  
At this point I seek more money because I would love to use its power to effect bigger change in the world. I do not want to risk my personal financial security in pursuit of that greater amount though. It should obvious that the power of wealth is non-linear, but I also see it as have at least two discreet slopes / phases.
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:39:33
Yeah, I meant BitFloor. They got hacked about a month after I used them.
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:55:58
I was dumb with Ethereum, for not buying 2,000 ETH for 1 BTC when I knew about it and had the opportunity.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:06:01
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:25:23
I have a very large incentive to learn about proper operational security techniques. I have more confidence in the security of my private keys than I do certainty about most other things in life.
Encryption is a very powerful concept. So while someone may still hunt for my coins, I have no fear they will succeed.
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:00:06
Thanks. Patience can be the hardest part.
I do not like material possessions that much. I have thought about all kinds of purchases I could make, but I think I would feel 'empty' about most of them. Having *zero* stress about the $10's and $20's that flow out of the pocket for daily life is a great reward though. I still cringe at overpaying for someone, even something small. But if the wind blew $100 out of my hand and into a fire, I would be curious what color flame it made.
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:33:30
Dammit. I meant BitFloor.
I'll edit.
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:16:06
I would guess that Core's software will remain the the dominant branch for now, but I think the forks are good because it shows a credible threat to their power. It good if they do not feel invincible.
It is certainly possible the s2x will work (and become 'Bitcoin'). I would prefer 2mb blocks myself, and hard forks do not bother me. There may be some drama on fork day, but I expect it will all resolve itself without too much damage.
I will hold coins on all side of forks for the foreseeable future. If better opportunities arise, I will look at them!
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:29:09
It would depend on the reason it was low. Maaaaaybe.
If the reason just seemed to be 'a bear market', fear based dumping, and low liquidity, I might but some more. Certainly around $1,500 I would. I think of it in terms or ratios. "For this percentage reduction in my non-crypto holdings, how much would I be able to increase my crypto by?" Right now I could use all of my non-crypto assets and only make a 25% - 40% increase in my Bitcoin holdings. I am already 'set'. If Bitcoin doubles, I will still be 'set', with or without more coins. If Bitcoin goes to $0 right now, I will still be fine. Not truly rich by my own standards, but still on track to get back there in a few years. But, if I bought more coins and then Bitcoin went to $0, I would be in a tougher spot.
So, I don't have very much to gain by buying more coins, but I do have quite a bit to lose. And that is solely due to my personal circumstance and asset allocations.
@_date: 2017-10-29 13:20:42
Great. I realize I also shared because I wanted to share my financial success, even if anonymously. In real life, just a few people know the magnitude of my holdings. If someone has an impressive job, "VP at a Bank", everyone knows they are financially successful. But I've basically earned my wealth in stealth.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:12:03
I agree that BCH has relieved some of the pressure that was behind the NYA, but not all. Part of it is probably just the "agreement part", the NYA agreement was what got SegWit through smoothly (though some may say it was the UASF), and the other part of the agreement was a 2MB hard fork. Perhaps many businesses feel their credibility would be on the line if they backed out.
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:00:33
I live inexpensively, and I am a saver.
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:33:47
I think it is understandable that they do not understand the value of Bitcoin.
Your first question seemed to be about the greater-fool theory. Bitcoin is not inventing the concept of money. Perhaps you could argue that money is already a greater-fool situation, and you may well be right. I do not think that Bitcoin needs to defend the concept of money itself. I see it as better money - more trustworthy money - than what people are used too. All Bitcoin needs to do is attract the lesser fool, the greater fool can save with government fiat.
Water in the desert for $1000 / gallon? I do not consider that to be enough information to make a comparison to Bitcoin.
Digging a hole and selling it? I think you can ask whatever price you want. The question is will someone pay. I think the only person who would pay $1000 for the hole in your backyard is someone who has a body to dispose of, and for that purpose it is probably a really good deal.
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:37:58
Thanks. I will probably hold at least 100btc for the long long haul (life?). I actually hated dropping below 300btc. My own "support and resistance" levels I guess. The higher the price goes, the less coins I need to sell to have the intended effect.
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:11:27
I think it is dangerous to sell one of the fork. No one knows the outcome.
If you are operating out of an ethical conviction, and without regard for the value of your holdings, that is a different matter.
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:33:15
Thanks. Sometimes I think money and will power are not so different. If you spend money, you no longer have it. Stating the obvious here.
The S2X battle? Because a majority of hash power has indicated they will mine on the hard fork, this looks to be the first time a fork like this has occurred. The outcome will depend which branch the ecosystem and economy side with.
I control my own private keys, so I am not worried. I will hold coins on both branches of the fork. I would personally prefer Bitcoin have 2MB blocks rather than 1MB. This battle can be looked at in much grander terms, a struggle for control, etc., but the underlying change does matter. If the group of miners was pushing for a very distasteful hard-fork, such as raising the inflation rate / coin cap, I think the fork would have no chance even with a majority of hash power.
I am really okay with either outcome though.
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:15:59
It probably would have gotten higher on the front page if I posted from my usual account.
And it's ThrowAway_OfCourses to you!
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:53:40
Well, that would suck if it happened, but I am pretty low-key, under the radar. I don't show the wealth.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:16:45
I hold an equal number of BTC and BCH. I have split the coins.
It feels good to share, even if anonymously. I wish it wasn't problematic (on many levels) to just tell everyone I know, as if I got a new job or something. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:49:25
Sharing a story for those who might find it interesting.
I can absolutely afford to lost it all. If all cryptos went to $0, I would still have about $700k worth of other assets. My consumption habits are easily supported by my income, so no change there. And, one thing having close to $3 million has helped me to understand is that there really isn't much special about it. I would rather have had then money and lost it than never had it, because now I've been privy to the feeling of being rich, and I *definitely* wouldn't make myself or other people miserable in pursuit of it again. Not that I did this time.
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:41:33
Educating people you know I think is the single most important thing. If Governments don't crack down on this tech, and especially if they support it, I have no doubt Bitcoin will grow and 'take over' the world financial system. Governments do care what people think, among other things, so hopefully we can define Bitcoin for someone before they hear an anti- argument.
Holding it, trading it, meeting people on Local Bitcoins, attending meetups, reading and writing here on Reddit, buying something with Bitcoin when appropriate. Don't go too far out of your way though, just do as you feel comfortable.
