If you try to scale up GPU farm you will find out what pain in the backside it is. It is much easier to scale ASIC based bitcoin mining. The bottleneck will be not capacity of local grid substation but amount of the capital one has to dump into this.  That is the difference.
@_date: 2012-04-04 08:59:19
it's hard to take seriously only for those who do not realise the fundamental difference between GPU and ASIC and corresponding mining setups. Do not bring your GPU age standards to ASIC age. The paradigm has changed.

"The Wikimedia Foundation, as a donor-driven organization, has a fiduciary duty to be responsible and prudent with its money. This has been interpreted to mean that we do not accept "artificial" currencies - that is, those not backed by the full faith and credit of an issuing government. We do, however, strive to provide as many methods of donating as possible and continue to monitor Bitcoin with interest and may revisit this position should circumstances change."
Now let's realise that this is not "fiduciary duty to be responsible and prudent" but plain ignorance. In fact they are breaching their "fiduciary duty" by not accepting Bitcoin and funnelling 3-5% of donation in fees to likes of paypal, visa and mastercard.

Some traders anticipate that pirate will actually pay his investors/victims and those will in turn dump those bitcoins and cash out. However at this point the only reason to believe that this payout will actually happen is word of the pirate that he will do so. Common sense, however, would suggest that pirate is sailing into sunset with all his booty.

I know him personally and he is a good friend of mine. No surprises here. I also would add that he never said much of "substance". Even while he was selling mining contracts in January 2011, when he had  20-30% of all bitcoin mining, he was just saying like "you pay this much you get this, you do not like it, get lost".
I would not discount blindly what he is saying. I myself dumped my GPU's and will not be buying any FPGA's. My speculation is that the early announcement has been made to discouraging people from wasting money on FPGA's and instead holding up for the next generation.
Do not get me wrong, this guy does not do stuff because he likes forums trolls. He is waging a war and these PR stunts surely are just first salvo's.

If you cannot represent more information, does not mean that blockchain size grows exponentially, while it is obviously fixed as evidenced by the source code.

About trust issues...
1 Trusting not legal tender. Legal tender goes hand in hand with constant debasement. No thanks. I trust more to something not controlled by central bankers. You disagree? Go open account in Cyprus or any other EU country or US for that matter.
2 Trust unregulated institutions. Yep I do not trust them. That is why I control my bitcoins myself.
3 Trust a cryptographic, peer-to-peer network computer technology most Bitcoin users don't understand. Nope. I do understand it. It's ok. It took Mr. Kaminsky much longer to figure it out. He should have started mining or buying right away instead of dicking around.
4 Trust that Bitcoin (really, a beta) won't be replaced by a superior digital currency system. I know what network effect is and how it is applicable. If you disagree go set up new ebay and facebook. Report back once you have market cap above those.
5 Trust that the Bitcoin Foundation/other participants won't create additional Bitcoin series. Unlike the author I do understand how Bitcoin works. Hence not a problem.
6 Trust that governments won't intervene to render Bitcoins worthless. How would they do it? Too late, you cannot uninvent Bitcoin. Go take down thepiratebay and torrents first.
7 Trust an anonymous creator (Nakamoto). I do not have to. That is the point. See 3. above.
8 Trust that Bitcoin markets will be available to provide prices in real currencies. Yep, kill one and 10 more will pop up in it's place. How taking down suprnova helped you fighting torrents?
9 Trust that your Bitcoins are stored in a secure location. You gotta trust yourself. and see 2. above and stop repeating yourself.
Now it is just ridiculous level of ignorance demonstrated by the author. The point and genius of Bitcoin among other things is that it exactly provides for money transfers without need to trust to any third parties. If you are arguing the opposite, gotta agree to disagree then.

Deflation is bad for an economy based on debt money as it causes destruction of real money that is multiplied by fractional reserve and accelerates inevitable eventual collapse of ponzi-like monetary system in self feeding feedback pattern also known as deflationary spiral. 
Once one assumes that the only possible monetary system is money as debt then it is easy to move on to a conclusion that deflation is bad for economy. However, a conclusion based on faulty assumption is simply invalid.

Smarter people than me long ago dissected this "net-neutrality" BS
for example:

Shifts responsibility and hides causes
Conceals meaning and prevents thought
Language should serve communication, but doublespeak is about “misleading, distorting, deceiving, inflating, circumventing and obfuscating.” Naming the FCC seizure of vast regulatory power as “net neutrality” is a classic example of doublespeak. There is nothing neutral about it. The free, quickly evolving neutrality of the net is actually coming to an end.

They probably refer to money transfers where the sender can send money in bitcoins or local fiat currency and the recipient can get it in local currency. Bitcoin would be used as meta currency to actually do the transfer and exchanged to/from local currencies as required.

Social networks and search engines are generally very bad examples of network effect. Auction sites are better. Auctions have the "moat" as size. You sell and buy stuff on ebay because of large amount of buyers and therefore fair price you can get. No matter how crap ebay is, you still go there because of large number of possible counterparties.
Currencies similarly have very strong network effect, simply because wide acceptance is an important feature of money.

Lots of very smart people had a very long and very hard look trying to find a viable attack on Bitcoin. A huge natural bounty is out there for a successful attacker. No luck so far. 
Important nodes such as merchants and large miners usually connect to a large number of trusted nodes and such attack will not work against those. Attacking regular users is still difficult and not profitable.

The flaw in your logic is that your conclusion "adoption is impossible, for Bitcoin" is not logically derived from your assumptions, even if those are true.
At the same time it is possible to prove you wrong very easily. If we take both your statements as assumptions and assume that they are true. 
1. Adoption creates deflation.
2. Adoption is impossible.
Then we would have logically correct conclusion that "Deflation is impossible". This is obviously not true because we know that "deflation is possible". Therefore at least one of your statements must be false.
You basically have fallen to circular reasoning logical fallacy.

tl;dr IMF is afraid that Bitcoin will destabilize weak currencies such as USD, GBP, EUR via "speculative attack" where weak currencies are dumped and devalued by speculators in favor of stronger currency such as Bitcoin. 
Usually IMF can help to "stabilize" the market in case of such attacks by having corresponding central banks giving IMF unlimited supply of "strong" curency that is to be dumped on the market by IMF in the name of stability. Unfortunately, IMF cannot get anyone to print for them unlimited amounts of bitcoins and therefore cannot do their gods given job. This is really fucked up, to have bitcoin reserves IMF actually need to have someone to print for them unlimited amounts of fiat that is to be used for buying bitcoin and as such starting the "speculative attack" they are supposed to prevent. Quite a conundrum!

My primary concern is not deflation either. The primary concern would be lack of universal acceptance. But this is changing quickly.

I do not think it is up to crypto-currencies and its proponents to decide. Remember... one does not need anyone's permission to start using Bitcoin. Those billionaires do not need any permission either. It is now simply a matter of how big the Bitcoin network is to make it viable to store/invest some serious money in it. As of now most of HNWIs barely can put a fraction of percent of their portfolios into Bitcoin. But I can promise you one thing. This is going to change with time.
As a side note, I do not blame those guys for doing the tax avoidance thing. Effectively they are simply hiding some of their wealth from the violent gangs AKA governments or in other words

litecoin is a product of jonnycomelates that has only advantage of ASIC hostile hashing algorith. Difference in confirmation speed is irrelevant. Advantage of litecoin is that it is effectively standing by backup/replacement for Bitcoin in case powers to be attack Bitcoin successfully. However, this would be only temporarily boon to litecoin because in this scenario it would be attacked next anyway. It is also so because in case of attack Bitcoin will adapt and adopt whatever features are required to protect itself including hashing algorithm change.
The fatal disadvantage of litecoin is in its inability to penetrate network effect of Bitcoin and therefore long term futility of this project.
My conclusion is that litecoin is not worth my time.

I would not worry too much about changing proof of work event. First of all, it is rather very unlikely to happen anytime soon. Of course, all the trolls on the forums and hangers on like Dan can troll each other into valhalla with this, but those who really have any influence on a possibility of such event happening do not even entertain such notion as viable at this time.
However, at some point in the future it is likely that the change of PoW algo will happen. Being able to adapt is actually one of the most important features of Bitcoin by design. If there is really overwhelming need for algo change such as presence of a viable or potentially viable attack on PoW algo then and only then the community will undoubtedly react very swiftly and do what needs to be done. Even then it will not be just some dictatorial decision by some committee. It will be a hard fork and every Bitcoin owner will own not just one set of coins but two and will need to decide whether he will want to sell one for another and the exchanges will be happy to accommodate such Bitcoin 1.0 vs Bitcoin 2.0 trade.
In other words free market will sort it out. Not Dan and Ko by babbling some nonsense about 100% certainty that PoW will be changed in the next 7 month.

In fact, I was the one who have reported that matter to police.
The "fat" paycheck you refer to is way below "poverty level" here in UK, those payments were completely lawful and reasonable with annual amount of remuneration received by me was well below 4000£. While fraudulent transfer of half million dollars worth of company assets to you and your friends and following fraudulent trading and stripping of company assets by "director and friends" is completely unlawful and fraudulent.

True, but somehow statists want everyone to believe exactly the opposite and have everyone run to the state and ask permission for every little thing.
On the other hand, given body of law in US with hundreds of thousands of  possible crimes on the books, while technically everything that is not declared illegal is legal, in practice the laws are so overreaching and broad that everything is illegal and the question is simply whether the state wants to have any specific individual/slave incarcerated at this time. Once they do, they will find some "law" to make it so.

There are 7 fundamental theoretical properties of ideal money.
theoretical properties of ideal money:
1. scarcity, finite and predictable supply
2. portability, easy to transport 
3. fungibility, all units have the same value
4. security and recognizability, easy to identify, easy to hide, difficult to confiscate or counterfeight
5. divisiblity, can be divided to small units and combined back into large units
6. privacy/anonymity
7. universal acceptance
When you get something that scores top marks on all the 7 above properties you know you've got ideal money.
Typical fiat money fails big time on 1,3,5,6 and fails to lesser degree on 4,2 while doing great with 7.
Gold is doing great on 1,3,5,7 is good with 4,6 while failing miserably with 2.
Bitcoin is scoring top marks with 1,2,3,4,5 while good with 6 and weak but quickly improving with 7.
Make you own judgement what is better money Bitcoin, gold or fiat.

Most decent portfolios already have significant gold allocation. Most of those do not have any Bitcoin allocation. The rise of Bitcoin is being driven not just by distrust into fiat, that is simply a catalyst. The rise of Bitcoin is caused primarily by investors allocating part of their portfolios to Bitcoin.
This process has just started and it is going to become more significant over time as Bitcoin wins higher and higher percent of investment and asset protection portfolios.

Of course they are encrypted. That is not the point. The point is obvious to any Information Security professional. By storing private keys granting access to their client's money Instawallet set up their users to carry unknown risks. There is just too many unknown potential threats and 3rd party tools that have access to the key in URL's. Various browser plugins, for example. YOU violated one of the core rules of information security "never take unknown risks".
The compromise was only a matter of time.

Historically, buying BTC and holding it long term was more profitable than investing in mining. There are a few exceptions in the very early days, and during a few weeks around June 2011 20-30$ per BTC prices. As someone who mined about 30-40% of all hashing capacity of Bitcoin at one point I do know that all too well. Should have simply bought.

This is the beginning of the next stage, that among other things will inevitably bring BTC value north of 10k$. I refer to integration of Bitcoin related functionality into all the accounting software and other business software, both offline and SAAS kinds. It is extremely likely that once the snowball starts with companies like Expencify, Bitcoin related features will be demanded by customers and implemented by most of not all software vendors. It is not difficult to do and competitive disadvantage of not having it will be too great to ignore this.
We are quickly moving now to the stage when for a software vendor not supporting Bitcoin will be a good reason for ridicule by both customers and peers.

It indeed makes sense for government, that all of the sudden goes suicidal and wants good old US of A to send an aircraft carrier group or ten to its shores, to hang all their private central bankers on the nearest lamp post and start it's own blockchain going.
However, Bitcoin-like currency must be de-centralized to be trustworthy. If some government starts it and controls the hashing capacity, then we know that they can change the rules of the blockchain any time they please. Print some more FatherlandCoins, for example. As such, they will find it difficult to compete with Bitcoin. What many wannbes and alt currency herders do not realize is that 
"There can be only one!"
I find it unlikely that government will use blockchains for own currencies, maybe for some other applications like title registries, but even those probably better off on top of global Bitcoin blockchain. I think governments will have to roll back to good old gold backed currencies and maybe Bitcoin backed ones.

No it is not. The blocks just started filling up a bit better, that has temporarily changed the linear function to another linear.

Wait until Bitcoin hits 300-500$ and watch AMD changing their stance soon after.
For comparison, Intel has market cap of 120bn. Meaning, wait until Bitcoin hits 10k$ for Intel to get into the fry.

It is just trivial TA, 96$ would be new all time high, that would cause  more optimism and more buying pressure. I am not big believer into TA stuff but used to know it rather well and when kept very simple it could be marginally useful IMO.

There is some rudimentary option trading on MPEX something. But I would not trust them with an option portfolio to hedge, for example, a large loan in amount sufficient to buy a home in UK and collateralized by borrower's bitcoins.
Also I heard IG index have recently started trading Bitcoin CFD's. Possibly one could build Portfolio Loan biz based on this option marketplace. For Bitcoin owners such loans would be a big thing as it allows people to buy houses without actually selling their bitcoins and as such without triggering capital gains tax events.
This kind of business is probably a little premature given current state of Bitcoin economy but this surely is going to be in demand once Bitcoin grows more.

Yes. Bitcoin is affected by inflation of USD. This is because USD is a fiction while Bitcoin is real. The more USD they print, the more USD per BTC there is, the more valuable BTC is in USD terms.
However, note that BTC is in emission state right now. Miners do create new bitcoins and amount of this emission is known precisely and in advance.

Learn from English lords. Bastards hoarded all land in Britain but 4% so far. They control one house of parliament to ensure that no law threatening status quo is ever introduced. They dripfeed land to market at a very slow pace and enjoy untold untaxed wealth as result. Enslaved serfs in turn enjoy insane house prices at 7x-10x annual salary.

It could be a factor. Also non mtgox exchanges have much lower liquidity so smaller imbalances of supply and demand and panic buyers and sellers have stronger effect than the would have on gox. Another possibility is that it takes long time to get money to gox in comparison to EU exchanges hence they are effectively leading indicators and gox will catch up once it clears its backlog of new account approvals, that was reported as high as 5500 accounts a few days ago,

Yea, nothing new here. You just keep piling up more and more dirt and lies on me, again lying publicly in your attempts to destroy my reputation. This MO of you  and your friend Mihai Alisie is clear. You lie and defame a victim of your fraud in order to cover it up. Blame the victim approach, how noble!.
I have an exemplary reputation with a great track record of fulfilling largest long term mining contracts in the history of Bitcoin. Unfortunately, you two are seem to be trying to destroy it with ridiculous lies, in order to cover up your fraud. Now you start publicly accusing me of fraud of bitcoinica and dialcoin, which is beyond ridiculous and without any basis in fact.
You and a director of Bittalk Media Mihai Alisie used my labour and my reputation as well as loans of money from me to bring up a business from zero, to about half a million dollars valuation. You two had me constantly fixing your fuckups. Then sold Bitcoin Magazine to yourself (within 96 hours after my resignation as a company director and in secret from me and some other shareholders), defrauding minority shareholders. An almost half million dollar company was sold for either 20k$ or 10k$. Which one is it? Liqudators reported that it was supposedly sold for 20k$, while I have written documents where Mr. Alisie informs shareholders that  it was sold for 10k$ and you have confirmed 10k$ sum. You guys are liars and fraudsters! Despite claims to the contrary that sale was unlawful and done without agreement of shareholders of Bittalk Media Ltd. No lawful and NO valid documents such as shareholder resolution authorizing that sale exists, despite all the lies and claims to the contrary of the company management. Numerous public and private statements of you and Mr.Alisie are false, libelous and designed to cover up the fraudulent sale of Bittalk Media Ltd.
Moreover, after all IP of the company was sold for peanuts, directors of the company continued fraudulent trading, including paying about 5000£ for print of magazines out of "sale" proceeds while Bittalk media is insolvent and while only beneficiary of those printed magazines were the company that "obtained" IP assets of Bittalk Media and directors of Bittalk Media personally to detriment of minority shareholders, i.e. effectively giving themselves a cashback on money they paid for Bitcoin Magazine.
You are the one who defrauded half of Bitcoin community with the pirate bet and then helped directors of Bittalk Media to defraud minority shareholders of the company. Would you BTW care to explain why liquidators of the company report that you Matthew Neal Wright have received 3000$ "loan" from the company? Have you repaid it? Was not it done after the company became insolvent at the moment of sale of all of intellectual property to "solo de jure director and his friends"? Should I mention lies made by the director of the company in sworn statement of truth in legal documents, lies that actually contradict his previous public statements and public witness accounts? Should I mention the company that unlawfully obtained IP assets of Bitcoin Magazine infringing my copyright on multiply items of content and not only economic rights but also failing to attribute it?
You may rest assured that crap is unlawful and there is no statue of limitation on such fraud and breach of fiduciary duties by company directors. Whatever lies you spawn now, this matter will be heard in a court of law in England in due time, the truth will come out and you will pay for what you have done. I pretty much promise you this. The more lies you spread about me, the more ammunition I have in my war chest. It is just better to wait a few years so that chances of recovery of assets and damages from all parties involved in fraudulent sale of Bitcoin Magazine are maximized. With all your personal attacks and endless lies  and deception you have pretty much guaranteed yourself a place on list of defendants and significant damages to pay down the road.
I too regret ever dealing with you and that asshole Mihai Alisie. Wish I never was so naive and not spent so much of my time helping you.  In my experience everything you touch turns into shit and then you  as a rabid dog turn on those  who helped you and supported you. I pity shareholders of those projects you are involved in.

The guy in the video has just completely missed the point. Not big deal, happens to the best of us.

Make Bitcoin a preferred payment option. This is all you need to do. Do not retire legacy payment systems just yet, but maybe charge some extra fee for using those dinosaurs.

161$ is so 4 minutes ago, 163$ now.

BTW the joke is only in the name of the "club". Otherwise I am completely serious. ownership of 2.1 BTC puts you in a club of at most 100 million people who own 2.1BTC or more. In reality it is likely that there would be about 10 million people who own that much or more. If you divide all 21 million bitcoins equially among all the planet population. Everyone would get 0.003 BTC or less. This should put it into perspective.
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:25:55
Now who is still going to argue that Bitcoin is not a bubble!?

Yep and it all started with pizza.
@_date: 2013-03-25 03:11:02
I think the mistake could also be in common assumption that previous price was correct. For all we know we had year long spell of irrational pessimism and things are simply correcting to move closer to more appropriate valuation.

This thing can be rather very volatile. One needs either be distracted or have balls of steel. Last weekend, for example, we had like 25% drop in price for a few hours. Suckers sold about 20kBTC in 55-60$ range in panic.
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:04:01
Bitcoin is good money, Dollar is bad money. As simple as that. All the economists will deny this, however. Chose who you believe more, us or them.  Then face the consequences of your choice.

The OP in its entirety seems to be very reasonable. And even being the troll I am, I cannot really fault it on anything. Thank You.

This course of action is beyond ridiculous. The force that holds together the banks (the puppet musters) is that little sweet lie that everything is insured and if SHTF the gubmint will make the lil guy whole.
Now they are intentionally removing this. It is pretty much like US treasury killing FDIC insurance. The only inevitable result of this is numerous and contagious bank runs.
I have a crazy theory... those euro commissars have bought loads of bitcoins in April 2013 and  now simply do what they do there all the time, facilitating their investments going through the roof.
@_date: 2013-03-30 18:11:52
Good observation. Increase of price and hence market cap decreases volatility not increases it. Here, problem solved.
@_date: 2013-07-04 17:48:12
Strange reasoning here. 
Bitcoin is like gold, but gold is better -&gt; WBT is like GLD -&gt; GLD is good because blah blah blah -&gt; WBT is crap because shorting of GLD caused sell off of gold and blah blah more nonsense blahh -&gt; WBT is real bad.
Sounds like a butt-hurt gold bug without any ability to build a coherent argument. Well..  one needs to be illogical to say that white is black.

You cannot uninvent Bitcoin!!!
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:48:30
If you buy some BTC now. YOU got in really early. Prepare for interviews coming up in a few years time. ;-)

I was just about to say "not again!" after rading the link bite title. But hey my head hurts when I start thinking about what you just said.
I can just say that is simply forks blockchain together with the universe. I.e. there simply be one more parallel universe with it's own blockhain.
@_date: 2013-06-28 17:54:04
I never put a single penny or Satoshi into empty gox in the first place. Gox going down at any point from now on can only be good for Bitcoin. Therefore it is not a single point of failure at all.

They just want your money and they will stretch all the way as long as you folks are willing to fund them. Fools and money...

- we've got a CDN
- we've got a colocation
- we've got a quick trading engine
- no LTC yet
- banks delay deposits for 10 days to reduce risk of fraud
- we are scared of declining market share and starting to move our ass.

"Insignificant" companies that start accepting Bitcoin early will become significant, while "Significant" ones that refuse to face reality will become insignificant. Nothing Bitcoiners need to do, but simply participate in the honest Bitcoin economy and avoid laggards where possible. 
Not accepting Bitcoin is a competitive disadvantage and with time it will become more pronounced. Free markets will sort the rest given time.

I would ask why current sellers are crazy enough to sell anything at all at these silly prices.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:44:35
Is it not hedge fund speak for "suckers sell now so that I can buy more on the cheap"?
@_date: 2013-03-27 11:32:20
BTW Bitcoin is capable to adapt to technological glitches and other unexpected external influences. Most people do not realize how really elegant Bitcoin design is and on how many levels.

No shit, Sherlock! Something is indeed fundamentally inadequate about fiat money and about so cherished by mainstream economists inflation as well as something is fundamentally inadequate about inflalted cash under the mattress losing less than in the banks.
BTW fairly neutral and decent article. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:31:52
There is only one viable explanation to this.
GOX have matching engine implemented in mysql. 
Yep sounds as something completely idiotic, but it is very plausible.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:23:16
I am not the biggest fun of his and some decisions by the gox in the past I  think are questionable. However, objectively speaking we have no any good reasons to not trust him and quite a few good reasons to extend some trust.
Having said that, I only trust myself when it comes to Bitcoins and never sent a single penny or satoshi to gox.
@_date: 2013-06-05 04:56:07
It is my money and it is non of your biz whether I spend it or hoard it or destroy it. NON OF YOUR BIZ. I will decide what is beneficial for me, not you.

Do not use instawallet. They were warned years ago that their URL as a private key idea is utterly idiotic. However they continue to insist that it is not so. Do not trust a single Satoshi to them.
In fact do not trust any 3rd parties if you can help it.

You've got a circular argument going on here, as you actually confirm my point by saying:


@_date: 2013-12-20 11:06:15
Do you mean one million people now cannot withdraw any fiat money from mtgox and have to buy back bitcoins to get anything out of that shithole? 
Who the heck cares about more ways of depositing money to a place where money would be effectively trapped?
@_date: 2013-08-26 01:33:23
I see the following inevitable result of these meetings. 
1. The bods present there will likely get themselves informed about Bitcoin.
2. Those of them with a brain will go and quietly buy some bitcoins for themselves next day.

it is rather trivial to use tor, vpns, etc...

If a third party (a cheap VPS hosting) has access to your private keys, then your private key are not not really private. VPS hosting services are not suitable for hosting bitcoind's with any money in there. Google "bitcoin linode hack", maybe it will help to understand my point.
