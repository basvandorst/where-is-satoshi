Cashed out at 16k instead. Sitting in fiat trying to decide what to do next ;)
@_date: 2018-01-30 04:40:40
My god, were the fees 100%?
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:08:44
I got mine for $1.50 from AliExpress. Hard to pass up at that price.
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:32:50
Altcoin exchange

A screenshot of a photo of a computer screen...?!
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:53:14
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:46:42
That's my plan. Waiting for $20-22k to cash out all of my initial investment. Then it's pure hodl time!
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:48:41
Check your email on haveibeenpwned.com. Mine was in the BTC-E dump and the Bitcointalk Forums dump.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:03:27
It's not an exchange, just a price ticker like this site is
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:30:31
I do this for a few family members and friends who wanted in but aren't savvy enough to properly handle their keys. Works out pretty well for all of us.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:03:59
Oh look, right on cue in my email :)
Interesting that they're trying to extort me for more BTC than OP!
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:35:47
Yeah, nah. Not buying this. My email was breached in both the Bitcointalk Forums &amp; BTC-E leaks. I get emails like these almost daily.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:48:08
Mind checking your email on haveibeenpwned.com? Mine was in the BTC-E dump (and the Bitcointalk forum dump), so if yours is in one of those then we have a winner
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:50:18


Not true - they can go up to 32 lanes of pure centralised bullshit without a hard fork!
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:39:14
38.46 BTC in my part of the world to get an average house. :(
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:17:20
I can't stand the guy, what he said was true yes, but he essentially poor shamed Andreas. Dick move all around.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:41:48


...people still use dialup?
In my country, our government subsidised the rollout of fibre to the home. As a result, I can pick from *85~ different ISPs*.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:14:32
I wonder what his/her backstory was.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:09:56
We don't, but a vanity address of that length would be pretty hard to compute. The difficulty gets exponentially harder the longer the vanity length. [Vanitypool puts the minimum price of 16 characters]( at 16160 BTC, below their break even point. That's 27 characters.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:03:43
Nothing - it's called arbitrage and it can be hugely profitable.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:02:44
If you click the settings in the top right, by default it looks like Bitstamp and Kraken
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:14:35
You should be fine, just empty your browser cookies.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:22:37
How does it imply that it's a fake? If they bought Gox.com recently, it fits in with the rebrand &amp; thus leads credibility to the document.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:03:21
Time to open a bar that accepts BTC and grab some cheap coins!
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:30:56
And I'm the opposite.
@_date: 2014-05-15 07:59:45
Nothing for University of Auckland (top 200) either, but I wasn't holding my breath...
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:13:36
I say tip whatever you'd like, they don't have to accept it!
I have a small amount of BTC and LTC, but alternate crypto currencies are very interesting indeed. The amount of press DOGE is getting is fantastic for crypto currencies as a whole.
@_date: 2014-03-03 07:03:11
If you haven't heard about proper grammar, your not alone.
@_date: 2014-03-10 04:32:51
Hey, many people would happily crack it for a 100% fee.
@_date: 2014-06-17 09:34:17
I doubt that includes credit cards.
@_date: 2014-04-27 00:25:33
So you're saying a Chrome extension on the host OS can infect a clean install inside a VM? Good luck with that.
@_date: 2014-04-27 21:23:55
If it's so trivial, why doesn't it happen more often? Surely every script kiddie would just make a dodgy extension and become rich? Custom code execution in a Chrome extension is very hard, then you have to deal with the edge cases of all of the different host OS and Virtualisation software (VMWare, Parallels, VirtualBox) *and then* deal with different client OS' and Bitcoin wallet software. It's not trivial by any means, possible yes but not trivial. My original point was saying that running it in a VM would've prevented the loss of the BTC *in this instance*.
Holy shit this community is full of assholes.
@_date: 2014-03-24 11:26:20
Seems like your opinion is popular in this instance.
If anyone is that paranoid, use a clean computer/live whatever, change passwords and reset 2FA. Not a big deal.
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:29:47
Absolutely nothing until they're traded/given away/Mark stops paying the renewals.
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:03:00
Yes, I do the same process whenever I get my morning coffee on the way to work. Sometimes I tramp out into the wilderness just to ensure there's nobody around that could be spying on me.
@_date: 2016-06-18 03:14:15
Anybody got a tl;dr?
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:40:42
You aren't multiplying where you should be.
(100 million units) * ($1 dollar) = $100,000,000 market cap.
([16,530,850 bitcoins]( * ($4,388.83) = $72,551,090,406 market cap.
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:37:36


Not OP, but if I got a text like that I'd probably screenshot it and show it to somebody that'd know what's up.
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:53:38
I did the same. I didn't trust the software to be anywhere near my main keys. Paranoid? Potentially, but the effort was minimal
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:50:44
I got some BTC from the faucet back in the day. Didn't think too much about it and forgot about it. Got a new laptop and wiped the old one. Sigh.
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:56:44
I also sold the laptop... so yeah, it's gone :(
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:45:17
Am Kiwi. Spoke to my accountant last week. She reckons I won't need to pay any tax on my crypto gains.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:46:29
If my Ledger Nano S hadn't arrived yesterday, I'd have gone in on this ;)
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:48:56
We just hit 10k on Bithumb. Prepare the memes!
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:46:11
When you send coins, it will show all of the input addresses used, so at that time the two addresses will be linked together.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:46:00
Pls sell ����
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:49:14
Almost $11k on Kiwi Coin now. Unreal.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:42:32
Supply and demand. If there's huge demand and no supply, the price goes up.
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:26:00
I got mine from AliExpress. 0.00012 BTC each, shipped! (Well, $1.20 USD. Too cheap not to buy a couple.)
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:22:16
Once your coins are on Segwit addresses (3), the fees should be much lower. My Ledger was proposing a $4 fee for sending 4BTC with a fast confirmation.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:41:23
What wallet did you send the coins from? They should be returned to the old wallet if they never confirm and drop from the mempool.
Also, how long have you been waiting? I sent some dust from an old wallet to my new one with ridiculously low fees, it took 2 weeks to confirm [but it did eventually](
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:38:38
I'll gladly cash you out at $100/BTC ;)
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:26:24
What do you mean?
The addresses are derived from your seed. They're all yours.
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:31:43
BTN fits the description?
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:23:55


[Wow, they hacked an Apple computer to run Windows? That must have been really hard to do!! They're a super duper hackerman!](
@_date: 2017-09-03 03:23:01
Bring on Segwit adoption!
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:30:37
Posts like these are exactly the reason why we need gender equality and this donation is so important.
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:23:20
Great time to buy!
@_date: 2018-03-06 08:38:30
Hard drives are so cheap though, everyone can just purchase a huge RAID array to store the blockchain! Right guys...? (/s)
@_date: 2018-02-16 02:12:48
Pineapple Fund has also donated to charities providing health care and education. Neither of these issues take away from the gender pay gap issue.
@_date: 2018-03-02 11:02:03
With volume it decreases. Mine are only 0.15%.
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:29:41
Just transferred 0.029 out from my exchange, they set a fee of 265.48 sat/B. $2.76 for $130 :(
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:50:31
Digital Gold - 88n8 is ��
@_date: 2018-02-16 02:44:37
In most sane first world countries the poor don't need to worry about healthcare or education.
Have you had a look at the Pineapple Fund website? They have funded plenty of healthcare and education ventures. I've probably missed ones from the following list, but the donations to these ventures far outweigh pro-gender equality ones.
Healthcare - $5m (Watsi $2m, Possible $1m, Organ Preservation Alliance $2m)
Education - $3.75m (Mona $1m, Pencils of Promise $1.25m, Quill $1m, WikiEdu $500k)
Gender Equality - $1.25m (SoGal $1m, WomanWhoTech $250k)

It's been above $6k AUD for weeks here in NZ :(

Plenty of computers and infrastructure in Vietnam. You'd be surprised. Incredible country.
@_date: 2018-02-23 19:28:16
Ugh yes. I shouldn’t be surprised by this, but I am.
@_date: 2017-09-03 03:23:25
....I only accept PayPal! /s
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:11:29
Not much volume here. I bought at $6750 NZD a few weeks back, ~$6146 AUD. 
@_date: 2019-09-22 21:32:00
Many, many prices in Vietnam are quoted in USD.
@_date: 2018-07-13 12:53:02
Just fiat/crypto exchange I'm pretty sure
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:16:44
How do you know if a tip is cancelled?
@_date: 2013-04-27 09:26:01
Seriously guys this is just getting
@_date: 2013-12-14 00:14:11
*Buy!* *Buy!* *Buy!* 
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:42:46
Technically you can if you have an Apple developer certificate. You can sign the file yourself and transfer it to your phone. A real pain in the ass though, just get the Blockchain app ;)
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:37:11
I hear TradeFortress is looking to escrow some deals too.
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:39:08


@_date: 2013-12-01 07:24:27
I wouldn't accept Paypal for them. Not in a million years.
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:01:40
Dude !
@_date: 2013-11-15 06:12:16
They can't take their 30% on transactions done through my bank's app, either. So that's not the reason.
@_date: 2013-06-29 02:07:28
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:57:46
I have RES but I don't see anything?
@_date: 2013-11-15 06:11:13
What's the joke? Nothing wrong about a good looking Bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:02:43
We don't, it's very easy here and I doubt anyone would give you any shit.
Shipping would be a bitch though.
