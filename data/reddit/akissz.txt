I think Vortex is smart and intelligent. I think Vortex should create more positive energy, though. I do not like it when people compare Cryptocurrency to PayPal, in negative ways. I think that is too negative.﻿

Yeah. 60 - 90 days ago.

This last comment puts your thread into perspective. You are negative balance. And your friends are not your friends maybe. It sounds like people purchased something from you, or sent you money, then those people disputed it maybe without your knowledge, then PayPal Granted the people their money back, creating negative counts on your account, thus PayPay deactivating your account. Basic miss use. You wouldn't do that with real money in your pocket or maybe you would. Why is this thread on Bitcoin thread?

Only describing what PP is seeing and what they do. It is easy to fix problems and show proofs. Did PP ask you to send any documents? Why is there a refund situation between a friend? The screen shots you post of "text notices" are generic texts which sometimes do not mean what they say because it is generated along side an algorithm. What is the age of your PP account?

Did the balance get near 0 many times in 8 years?
They spoke to you over the phone?
Have you tried making the balance not zero recently? Depositing money to the account? Can you still sign-in?
You didn't exactly answer the refund question. Refunds are made because of problems. Did you have many refunds in 8 years? If you had a couple small problems in 8 years that is a problem.
Did you call PayPal?

It is also ridiculous for the video posted and not good for the general bitcoin community growth. The video should have been posted on a more professional mainstream popular site.

I prefer FreeBSD. But I have used it for 20 years. It is difficult for some people to use.

yeah why do people keep posting things at this weird url.

This sounds like a case of operator error. Lack of knowledge of banking systems and banking laws. And bad talking a good company because of personal frustration.

This is weird. Unusual url and also unusual event with low tech people. Reminds me of 1995 or 1996.
