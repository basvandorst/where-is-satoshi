They could not do this from a pure legal standpoint. 
Bfx is not "giving" ANY money, especially not upper management, so not sure what your talking about. Zane has clearly stated that they have been consulting with their lawyers from the start. How could they not?
The hacker is the thief, bfx is merely trying to pick up the pieces that are left and put it back together.

Compared to the Mt Gox fiasco, Bfx seemed to do all they could and in a timely manner. 
What do you suggest? Bankruptcy? Which would take years for users to get their money (if at all), minus court costs, which could take more than 36% of your funds. Now I ask you, are you stupid?

I was in ETH and ETC during the hack so my money was "safe", but I think this is one of the fairest outcomes. It hurts, but it is a logical outcome for them to STAY in business. 
**If they stay in business, we ALL should eventually recoup our losses!**
For everyone asking how much Bitfinex is losing/putting up, they are only losing fees in trading for the sites downtime and the haircut only affects bfx employees whose money is on the site, but NOT the company as a whole. 
&lt;start rant&gt;
It is very apparent that hardly anyone on bfx has read their T&amp;C's when they signed up. They are clearly NOT liable. But hey, if you guys wanna waste more money on an unwinnable lawsuit, go for it. &lt;end rant&gt;
