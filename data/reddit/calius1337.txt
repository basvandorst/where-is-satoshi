 I hope it is at least in cold storage...
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:00:36
That is not true for everyone. Sure if you store your hard mined BTC on your Windows machine which you use to carelessly surf the web and to click on every link you encounter, then I would say that you have a point.
But I am talking about true cold storages. No connection to the interwebs, no every-day use PC.
I, for myself have a dedicated Raspberry Pi running FreeBSD that I only use offline to sign my transactions with, if I ever need to take BTC out of the cold storage. That is way safer than any shady online service there might be. The SSD is encrypted and I have several copies of it stored in different places I regularly check and replace. 
Maybe it's because I am a cynic, but I simply don't trust online services. Never have, never will.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:48:20
I don't understand why the fuck people keep all their assets on some exchanges instead of either in cold storage or at least on their fucking computers. I get that it is easier if you are a regular or a instant trader to have some of your assets on the exchange's wallet. But only SOME not all of them.

Ho did you make this neat hologram thingie? I want one too.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:22:05
That doesn’t count. Of course I roughly know how much the price is because of spoilers, but I don’t actively go an check for it on my own. 
Even when buying new BTCs I don’t actively look for the price. I have put a monthly renewing buying option of a certain amount of BTC no matter the current price. 
Edit: I meant to write that I buy BTC equal to a fixed determined amount of €. Euro-cost-averaging, if you will.

First, I set up a monthly repeating transfer of x€ from my bank to the exchange. The exchange has an API that I use. Then it’s a simple matter of an automated cronjob to execute the API call.

So let’s say I want to have a LN node. I would open it with 10mBTC in it, broadcasts that transaction to the blockchain and pay tax fees for that. Once confirmed I can go ahead and spend those 10mBTC. What happens once the 10mBTC run out and I want to put in more mBTC into it? Is that another tx I have to make and for which I have to pay to fees?

Assuming you are using a clean PC, here are the basic steps:
* Download and install Electrum. It will present you with a seed which is composed of 12 random words. Write those words down, that's important! Really, that's THE MOST IMPORTANT PART.
* Follow the installation instructions
* When finished you will have your own wallet with some generated addresses.
* Transfer the bitcoins from your coinbase wallet to one of your addresses
* Congratulations, you are your own bank now
Why are those words important, you ask? Glad, you did. Let me explain:
Electrum is a deterministic wallet, which means that all addresses are generated in a foreseeable manner. All it takes is the seed, i.e. the 12 words that were generated at the beginning. Because of that, backing up your wallet is as simple as remembering the seed. That's also why you should never tell the seed to anyone, because with the seed they have access to all the bitcoins stored inside the wallet.

That's not true. With a valid account number I can easily withdraw money from it via SEPA as long as I have the general approval of my bank to do so. They will only check for your valid mandate if someone reports fraudulent activity. 
I am the treasurer of a local club and last month I accidentally withdrew money from one of our member's second bank account for which I had not a valid mandate. It was a complete different bank than the first one. Luckily, he caught the mistake and made me aware of it. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:08:46
Put it in your own wallet on your hard drive. Get a deterministic wallet like Electrum, memorise the seed, write it down or store it somewhere safe. Don't you ever give the seed away. Bit make sure that in case something happens to you, your next of kin can access your wallet.

Only if you reuse addresses. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:30:29
If you are using the newest Electrum release 3.0, it has the option to create a native SegWit Wallet which supports the new, still in beta status, bech32 addresses, which are natively SegWit capable.
The down side is that there is no other wallet which can accept transaction to and from bech32 addresses.
If you are a newbie in matters Bitcoin, I suggest staying away from it until bech32 has been accepted.
Edit: Bech32 addresses start with bc1.

Electrum is perfectly safe for storing BTC in it long term. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:43:01
Use electrum. It's an excellent deterministic wallet. You back it up by storing/remembering the 12 word seed. 
A word on security:
Don't store your hot wallet on your every day PC. Make either a virtual machine for it or do it like me and use a raspberry pi with a secure OS (I use FreeBSD) and install your wallet there. This PC doesn't need to have an internet connection. Make it a cold storage device.

Laminated paper inside a safe works fine. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:09:44
The way I have set it up is as follows: My seed phrases resides in a secure bank vault written on a laminated piece of paper. With it is a small letter in an M-Disc which explains to my wife what this is and what she can/should do with it. Furthermore, my wife knows that we have some assets in crypto and understands that it’s basically money that needs extra protection.  So she is already aware about the existence of our crypto portfolio. 
I’m not saying that this is the perfect solution, but it is rather solid. One way to improve it would be to use a CryptoSteel device for storing the seed but I couldn’t get my hands on one yet. 
Some people use fireproof envelopes for storing the seed or they use multiple vaults in different banks. It depends on your personal feeling of security.

@_date: 2017-10-10 18:13:45
The most important thing is to be in full control of your private keys. This means getting the coins out of the exchanges into a wallet controlled only by yourself. I recommend a deterministic wallet like electrum. This way you only need to backup the seed. 
Then, just hodl tight and enjoy the ride.

First, read about Bitcoin. I really suggest reading the original paper. It's not that long but it explains how it works. You need to *understand* how it works, or you run at risk of losing some, if not all your Bitcoins. 
Then educate yourself about wallets. I suggest using a deterministic wallet like Electrum, but the choice is yours. Also learn about cold storage, you might need it later. 
Now you have to find a service where you can buy and sell Bitcoins. Personally I don't know any, since I am from Germany and there is virtually only one service we can use. (bitcoin.de)
Start by buying a small amount of Bitcoin and practice sending them across your own wallet addresses until you get the hang of it. Learn about fees and play around with different settings. Ideally you will notice how the fee affects the transaction speed. 
When you think you are ready, set up a cold storage where you will transfer your Bitcoins for the long haul. 
Never, **EVER**, spend more money than you are willing to lose. Bitcoin is volatile as fuck. Albeit improbable, but still possible, Bitcoins could become worthless by tomorrow. Again, never buy more than you can afford to lose!
If you have questions, feel free to ask via DM.

If you can export them, so can they. Using online wallets is a very careless act. I don't get why people do that.

Just our of curiosity, do you just hodl by just keeping the 10000 bitcoins you mined back in 2010 or do you still keep buying?

No. Pull your BTC out of the exchanges. ALWAYS keep 100% control over your private keys!

I would suggest using a deterministic wallet like electrum. This has the advantage of being able to recreate your addresses from a 12 word seed and thus it's easy to recover in case of hardware failure. 
The only thing you need to store safely away, in a safe deposit box for instance, is said 12 word seed. 
You can also create a cold storage wallet for keeping most of your BTC in some sort of deep storage and use another hot wallet for your day to day BTC usage like you would do with a checking account. 
So imho I would go with electrum.

Use a different wallet like electrum.
