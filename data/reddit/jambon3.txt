Much like the original poster in the /bitcoinmarkets thread, I would also like to hear the Bitcoin Core / Blockchain side of the story for balance. The /BTC version of the story is a horrifying account of the state of Bitcoin and I'm really interested in the opposing viewpoint.
@_date: 2017-08-10 04:04:40
Fantastic reference for a new entrant to this market. Why can't all conversation be this informative? Can you recommend any forums or other social media where you can find more of this level of discussion than on Reddit?
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:47:31
I admit I'm not fully informed on the details but I believe it's primary goal was to fix problems with the previous EDA which caused wild swings back and forth by miners as difficulty adjusted.
However the scheduling was significantly arranged to be in time for the original S2X fork so you have to conclude it will also aid in diverting hash away from BTC during a market move like this.

Apt-get update does not return updated version of bitcoin-qt on Ubuntu. Any idea how long it usually is before the PPA is updated?
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:13:40
Thank you for sharing this.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:52:51
So I might inquire with one of these firms about a general subject like "improving my exposure on social media" or similar to get a conversation started. But how would I go about turning the subject to spinning up fake accounts for the purposes of deceiving?
Surely there is a subtle dance of understanding involved in those conversations? Or is it openly mercenary?

And there it is. Updated!

It seems like prevention of a sudden killing blow to the chain is a necessity whether there are additional security threats or not. As long as the chain can be mined, the market can potentially sort out the dispute. But if difficulty can not be adjusted for potentially months, the ensuing panic could be irreversible. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:25:12
Yes it will continue and get worse. No question. But I'm talking about this condition of having 70% of hash power removed from the network. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:48:38
So you think this pump is over?

For the places where it is not already a synonym it's still phonetically simple
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:41:43
That was my guess as to how you would buy "social media as a service" - the synonym for unscrupulous business "public relations".
This would be a hell of a piece of investigative journalism for anyone with the time/money to conduct it.
If I set out to research this what are the "code words" I'd use when searching for these providers? I can only assume they maintain the lowest possible profile given the seediness if their services. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:39:44
Same here. That and how markets work for setting prices and so forth. I haven't even gotten into the Austrian economics yet but look forward to that too. My gains have been trivial given my late entry and risk averseness but the subject matter has been gripping. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:38:25
As long as the price can be held/moved up, the DAA will ensure that mining the other chain will remain more profitable.
If it works as hoped for. (If it doesn't, this adventure may quickly be over.)
This could result in what we've already seen, most hash moved to the other chain and near impossibility of transacting BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:28:03
Moved mine to exchange an hour ago. Yes high fees but that's how it goes during a twice a decade event like this
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:36:49
That is a very creative idea but could you explain further or point me to references discussing why a DAA would not be a good choice to address this issue? I'm new to the technology but it seems almost like a requirement to have a DAA if two competing chains will share the same POW.

The message we needed to take away is that running nodes would have had no effect on stopping either the abortive S2X play or the Cash hash power migration play. I run a node too because I want to contribute and understand the technology but they do not increase anti fragility against the threats recently faced. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:59:54
Your question is appropriate. On an unrelated subject I have recently made an effort to build software for the MimbleWimble project in order to be more of a contributor and less a spectator:
If you could suggest similar ways to get involved with lightning, I agree that I should direct my efforts, humble as they are, there instead of idle handwringing.

What if? You can bank on it. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:43:12
Maybe I'm misunderstanding the tech then. I wasn't considering every micro transaction being an individual swap. I was thinking of it more like having a checking and savings account. Where one transaction from savings to checking might fund dozens of transactions from checking to vendors if that analogy makes sense. 
If this is not how the tech actually works, then what is a use case of atomic swap?
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:32:35
Why not?
This BTC/LTC swap was not over LN.

Damn, even my cynicism didn't expect expect a marketplace of lies to be that open
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:36:29
I am firmly in the store of value camp, but if this is the best case scenario it validates the Cash argument that scaling issues are holding back the value of BTC for medium of exchange use cases.

That absolutely sums it up. Maybe young people today also understand these basics too. I'll be optimistic. 
As far as the ongoing education bubble I think that could be handled nicely by making all future student loans eligible for bankruptcy protection. That would both put an end to $250K loans for liberal arts degrees and dramatically drive down the cost of education itself.
Unfortunately finance has a nice little racket going - turning young impressionable future generations into profit opportunities. It is enough to make you cry. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:02:31
You've obviously thought about your choices. I fear that many do not appreciate the horror of debt as they should in the us. There are already multitudes of stories of young people who can't buy a house or even get married because of life crushing student loan debt. The consequences for society are dire if we continue down this road. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:23:14
Good help you if your plan is to be a lifetime debt slave
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:11:40
And an hour or too after that they HF away that difficulty adjustment. Their new DAA could make or break this whole play.

I'm not impatient because I'm a store of value guy. However it is undeniable that buying coffee was a clear and repeated use case in the original Bitcoin vision ( been reading The Book of Satoshi) and the slower we are to address those desires the more we open ourselves up to risks such as forks.

Great idea. Give it a try. Actually doing it will take you out of beginner status on a hurry. One way or another. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 13:31:04
So it all comes down then to who gets to decide what the "valid" chain is. It's between us and the people with billions of dollars.
Surely you can see why I'm not reassured?
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:01:30
And won't coinbase be one of the new 2x node operators, presumably able to create demand for this supply through their huge user base?
@_date: 2017-09-26 11:54:31
It will be easy for them to say they have the valid chain. They will just slap down the 2009 white paper and call score board. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:15:44
I'm getting the feeling that the poison pill is our only card. I guess we have to publicly commit to exile on our own chain and scream to the high heavens about how damaging that could potentially be to the precious "investor value" that is so important to the 2x crowd.
As said in Dune, "He who can destroy a thing, controls a thing." If we are willing to destroy wealth to save freedom we will be speaking the same language as these people at least. 
Of course that would all depend on seizing the message and successfully identifying them as the opponents of freedom, therefore the opponents of Bitcoin.
The best possible outcome would be some variation on this kind of brinkmanship that leads to abandonment of 2x by enough signatories out of fear of loss of value.
@_date: 2017-09-25 11:23:51
To make sure the fee is as high as possible? Great!
@_date: 2017-09-26 18:27:25
So in that horrific scenario, what will we spend our time doing?
@_date: 2017-09-26 13:16:51
But the miners and millions of coinbase users do not, correct?
I may not be understanding your point but I don't see a way to fight: 
Longest chain 
Essentially all hash rate 
Majority of full node compute power (not currently present but easily purchased)
Is there any kind of a plan for resistance? What is the scenario where 2x loses?
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:18:24
And free of transactions? Am I reading that correctly? Only 1 transaction a second is occurring in this worldwide 100bln market?
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:16:53
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:34:46
I have to stand up for coinbase here. Once you've had your noob initiation and moved to GDAX you get usd balances held in FDIC insured accounts. None of this tether nonsense. Unparalleled among exchanges.
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:28:35
Do we know if there is any reasonable expectation that there may be relay protection by that time?
Reddit may not be the best place for objective information but the message here seems to be that this fork would be a hostile seizure of the technology. If so lack of replay protection might be a feature rather than a bug? Would it not necessarily hurt the "losing" chain more than the "winning" one?
@_date: 2017-09-24 16:36:29
So no "bursting" is possible? The documentation is a little unclear and seems to imply that total daily bandwidth will be managed but I don't see it saying that bandwidth at any given moment will be effectively rate limited. If that is what it does that would be fantastic but it doesn't explicitly say that in the docs. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:01:31
You're over thinking it. None of that makes any sense. Obviously what happened today is that a major hedge fund hit a price target when it broke the 3000 resistance this morning and initiated a multi 100 million dollar buy. There is no other reasonable explanation. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:35:37
And just for a sanity check, is .00059 BTC / KB considered low?
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:25:51
I caught that hedge as well as the other one about a possible change in naming later
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:33:30
I was thinking of starting this thread myself. The discovery of Bitcoin as a vehicle for wildly profitable exchange market manipulation using methods illegal in traditional securities exchanges represents a danger at least equal to the benefit of rising valuations.
I'm relativity new to crypto but understand it has already survived numerous previous tests and threats. This has got to be considered a serious new one.
The core danger as I see it is that valuation is now completely divorced from adoption, usage or technology and totally linked to utility in otherwise illegal trading practices for deep pocketed experienced traders.
Fascinating times indeed. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:00:28
This is almost certainly the root cause. Compromising the recovery email account is the current holy grail for hacking. It is even more valuable than your exchange account because it can be used to compromise any of your accounts in this exact same way.
You need to secure this account with 2FA using authenticator/smart card. No SMS! And backed up by one time recovery codes in a safe deposit or off site else where. This is mandatory as you've learned. Sorry man. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 17:41:06
That's the default behavior. The documentation referenced in this thread states that the default setting is unlimited. 
It may be a case where I am simply using services that are more sensitive to upstream saturation than you are. If your router shows real time bandwidth graphing I'm guessing you'll see it bursting up to your max upstream regularly. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:41:03

They're betting that the majority of new money and future money are poorly informed sheep. Probably a very solid bet. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:49:28
Thank you for that. That's the type of information I was looking for. Reading it, I don't think my understanding of how Bitcoin works is that far off. The same scenario still presents itself: 
Miners move essentially all hash power to 2x
Major exchanges "transparently" convert to 2x
Miners/Exchanges fund sufficient full node compute power to support their goals.
Miners/exchanges seize BTC ticker in exchange listings
Miners/exchanges use all additional financial/marketing resources at their disposal to declare 2x=bitcoin
Under that scenario we can all still run our nodes and support our choice for valid chain.
But we still lose, right?
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:02:04
And about my original question regarding easy ways to do this that do not involve conversions back and forth to Satoshi?
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:12:57
I agree. I'm just starting to feel that as Bitcoin becomes more known I have started to remove wallets from my phone. Not that I have much Bitcoin, but just for the same reason that I don't carry all the cash I have around with me. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:42:33
"The idea that the 'value of bitcoin is created through utility' is complete baloney."
It's not baloney at all. The current utility is allowing experienced deep pocketed traders to use trading methods that are illegal on regulated exchanges to make vast profits in real money. Thus the high valuation of the asset.
You might not be able to realize any of this value and it may not be sustainable but it is an undeniable utility.
We will see if other utility arises or if this one diminishes in value. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:53:03
Unless there is vast hash power supporting those rules, right? 
If there is, they will do plenty, right?
@_date: 2017-10-31 11:15:07
Sure. Just like you did in 2010. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:54:06
I wouldn't go all in until we see how the November segwit2x story plays out. That conflict has the potential for massive price disruption. I'd save at least a little dry powder for that unknown.

This is what intrigued me about this idea.

@_date: 2017-09-17 19:54:41
But doesn't this support the criticism that Bitcoin is not actually "used" for actual "electronic payment" at any thing remotely close to the scale that would justify its valuation?
@_date: 2017-09-24 16:07:13
This seems a bit impious. You'd probably best offer an atonement of some sort. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:47:37
You think these guys don't have lawyers? Bitpay has already published a statement to customers on their site for example. I'd imagine all the other signatories have appropriately covered their asses as well. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:58:00
My understanding is that all the SPV wallets could switch to 2x nodes without the users even knowing. And of course every coinbase (and other exchanges) user will immediately begin transacting in 2x also without even knowing it. Exchange transactions being essentially all transactions on the Bitcoin Blockchain it seems like miners will do fine. They are after all the ones pushing this.
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:29:38
Good post. I'm curious about this too.
I'm running a dedicated VM only running this service and have the port 8333 PAT to the VM. 
I would also be interested in further hardening for good measure though.
Anyone got a good recipe for this?
@_date: 2017-09-27 10:52:03
Yes but would allow them to legitimately say that the modified coin was not Bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:34:14
So with a few million dollars thrown at AWS for 2x full nodes and agreement among miners and key exchanges they will potentially have:
The longest chain 
The vast majority of hash rate
More 2x full node compute power 
This does not concern you?
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:13:11
And mine is protected by touch ID. Doesn't protect you any more than your cash is protected by having a chain attached to your belt when a knife is in your face. I'm probably over the top here. Just saying that many people might carry a hell of a lot more Bitcoin on their phone than they would cash in their wallet. Both are as easily robbed. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:57:45
I would love to use electrum for this purpose. Are you saying the offline electrum wallet can use a downloaded copy of the Blockchain? That was the original question. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:12:59
Seriously, how hard do you think it's going to be to stand up 10k of their own nodes with 10x the compute power of ours? You do realize they will have billions of dollars in their war chest for this fight right?
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:29:34

I'm all in but what good will our full nodes do when they move 90%+ hash to 2x and seize the mantle of longest chain?
I'm having a hard time seeing an effective strategy to fight this. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 11:24:36
Why would they need that? I'm sure the docker container or ovf or whatever is already in the hands of AWS and ready to spin up their 20k nodes on demand.

That's exactly what I want to do and I'm just looking for a sanity check to make sure everything is set up correctly. I suppose making some transactions will accomplish that. 
So to create the online wallet what I need to add to the address list is the master public keys from the offline wallet, not just addresses from the address tab in electrum?
@_date: 2017-10-06 01:07:49
Sounds like a good opportunity for a lawsuit if you are up for it. If dealing with Coinbase you are not engaging in a "virtual currency transaction". You are transferring usd from one FDIC insured account to another.
Oh to have the time and resources to litigate these kinds of things.

Expect lots of freaking out during your crypto journey. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:54:14
Bitcoind will consume 100% of your available upstream bandwidth by default which will cripple your internal network user experience. A simple script my platform (Ubuntu) took care of me but I'm glad I read this thread to find out about the new code that allows it to be handled in the config. Much better. 
Bottom line, I'm paying for a certain amount of upload that I was not using. I now give 75% of that bandwidth to the Bitcoin network and have not noticed any impact to internal network user experience since I successfully implemented the throttle. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:35:49
Well if buzz is what you're after by all means go all in. You might even get lucky. It was our mistake thinking you were talking about investing and not gambling. As long as YOU understand the difference that's all that matters. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:25:23
That is a good question. I was sure I could apt-get upgrade bitcoind but I'm still at 0.15.0 myself

What I'm talking about is a sanity check.
When using cold storage your "real" wallet will never be able to show your balances. There is always the possibility of doing something catastrophically stupid like incorrectly adding public keys to your watching wallet, right. For worrisome people like me it would be great to have a way to check your holdings directly against your offline storage itself, not against block explorer or a watching wallet as I thought I clearly explained in the original post.
It seemed like such a simple question when I wrote it. 
Is there any wallet which can be set up offline, then use a downloaded copy of the Blockchain to display holdings, all completely offline at all times?
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:30:18

@_date: 2017-09-20 15:46:42
As another newbie I'm curious why you would think so.
My thought progression is a little different. If the 2x crowd brings enough hash power to bear and becomes the longest chain subsequently allowing them to claim the BTC ticker and then claim Bitcoin has been "fixed" then they may have the highest valuation after the dust settles.
In that scenario lack of replay protection becomes a feature as it disproportionally punishes use of the competing chains. You risk losing more by transacting on the "low value" chain than on the "high value" chain.
Of course this may all be irrelevant if it is difficult to split coin as has already been mentioned.

HW wallets may have more "vectors" but there are many more known cases of Bitcoin stolen during the process of sweeping private keys to a wallet.

Yep. Been RBF'ing already today myself.

Let me guess. No 2FA on the email recovery account for the exchange account. Game over.

No. I'm asking about the easiest way to estimate what a reasonable fee is for confirmation within 8 hours. 
I know I can massively over pay or get into fee conversion back and forth into Satoshi. Is there really no other way?
Also I'm asking about my currently stuck transaction and whether .00059 BTC / KB is grossly low such that I should expect no confirmations after 18 hours.

Feel free to substitute attack / upgrade interchangeably for the purposes of this thread. Curious about any perspective.

How long does it take to demand they unlock the phone, look for bread wallet and make them unlock it? Bitcoin gone.

Insider knowledge of some sort driving the buying. We'll find out what the news was later.

So the electrum server knows that you are"checking the balance" of all your public keys so now knows those keys exist and are in use, where otherwise  no one would know that? Something like that?
Pardon the imprecise jargon.

What shameful ignorance

Hmmmm. Not that useful for me. My problem has not been amount of bandwidth consumed / billing, but saturation of the upstream pipe which caused issues with some downstream applications. At least it looks helpful for those poor souls who pay by bandwidth.

My thought exactly

That is the only explanation that makes any sense for the BTM. In addition to association with vice it teaches the message that buying Bitcoin = getting ripped off. 
BTM business model seems like the ultimate expression of greater fool theory.

And of course 'most users' can perfectly equal 'most hash power' if that's the way the wind blows.
This decision gives pole position to BTC but reserves full options to make the fork 'temporary' and rename later based on the 'users'
Perhaps the best that could be hoped for since they are a NYA signatory.
