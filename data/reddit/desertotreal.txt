Lol.  If I had funds there I would take them out immediately.

I was thinking the same thing, so I just created a wallet on my android phone.  I used this [app from fDroid](  Took about 5 mins to write down my password and mnemonic and send myself the bitcoins.  Probably a good idea to have more control over your money.

No.  If he's seen it, it's fake or a scam

Would be cool if this guy got destroyed by the press.
@_date: 2014-06-13 05:30:24
Can someone explain to me what this means?  Can they change the block chain to their will if they own 51%?
@_date: 2014-03-06 07:29:58
For me though, it's not banks that I don't like.  It's the central bank.  The bank that creates money whenever it wants to.  If we have our normal banks store bitcoin, I see nothing wrong with that.

This is a war, and we are soldiers.

The reason big banks don't want anything to do with bitcoin, and in fact, want it to fail, is because without fiat currency, they cannot privatize profits and socialize losses.  When the large banks make risky investments, and they work out, they make money, as they should.  But if they investments fall through and the bank begins to fail, the federal reserve can bail them out.  No other business has a system like this.  Every business owner would love to be able to be bailed out when they make mistakes, but it is something the free market denies them.  However, big banks don't play by the rules, and they want to keep it that way.  I am extremely worried about banks lobbying to make bitcoin illegal so that they can keep their scam going.  Obviously, if bitcoin was illegal, it could still be used, but the general population would never adopt it.

With etf coming, maybe not ��
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:12:52
Indeed.  I wonder what will happen if people start putting illegal things in the blockchain like images of minors.  How would the US react?  Also, what if in the future, tons and tons of data gets stored in the block chain.  Imagine 500 years from now, all the data that could be in it.

So is mining worth it again?  I don't understand this whole mining problem that is currently happening.
@_date: 2017-03-02 01:58:56
Reminding myself to read this
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:45:50
Why is storing on a hardware wallet not considered risky?  if it fails or is stolen, you lose all your bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-01-10 18:05:58
Devil's advocate here.  Could be fake 
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:13:54
Good thing we put a block size limit in so we can never have that many transactions :p

Core does not own Bitcoin.  In fact, they want to change it into something else with segwit.  If anything, BCore should be considered the alt coin since once segwit is activated it won't follow the Bitcoin white paper
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:28:56
That's fine.  It's still not Bitcoin though.  It's another crypto currency
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:30:18
With bitcoin cash price surging, hopefully we won't have to worry about with core thinks anymore.
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:11:40
Not the entire bitcoin community lives on @_date: 2017-08-03 15:27:53
But core wants to destroy the current block chain and replace it with a segwit chain.  Bcc will be the only fork with the actual Bitcoin blockchain
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:34:48
Btc is shit.  Look at the mempool
@_date: 2016-12-12 02:52:00

@_date: 2017-08-18 13:40:46
So you'll sell any segwit coin?

How exactly could we trust blockstream?  This feels like them trying to be the new FED

Does this have to do with Trump winning?  Bitcoin seems to be jumping.

All governments are threatened by Bitcoin.  Fiat gives them a lot of power.  Too much power.
@_date: 2017-04-03 00:07:36
Not sure it's real now...
@_date: 2017-04-30 19:06:48
Isn't segwit only a temporary solution?  What if transactions increase x4 after segwit is activated?  Won't we be back where we started?
@_date: 2017-04-13 22:36:25
I use Gemini now

Ron Paul's end the fed movement really got me thinking about sound money.  A friend showed me bitcoin and the rest is history.
@_date: 2016-10-21 04:47:22
lol, no thanks.
@_date: 2017-05-02 04:04:36

So when I forget it, I lose ALL of my money?

The mods don't like this kind of talk.  Expect these comments to be deleted soon.
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:00:25
No, the worst thing that could happen is for Rothschild like people to get in control of bitcoin payments.  Then they decide who can/can't make payments and put a bunch of rules and regulations around it.  Oh wait, that sounds like 2nd layer transactions.  It's okay though, we just need bigger blocks and we can have both layers.  Oh wait, core won't increase block size because they're bought or blackmailed.  I guess we've already lost.
@_date: 2017-07-01 14:38:29
This sub is controlled by blockstream, not miners
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:27:22
I don't think so.  If anything the scaling problem is hurting the price.
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:52:07
I'll buy it on the cheap while everyone is dumping
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:43:15
Why not?  Right off the bat, bcc will be objectively better than btc because fees will be 1000x lower.
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:40:58
Thanks bro
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:07:52
BTC will die because transaction fees will be 1000x more than BCC.
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:04:12
I wouldn't say it's a shitcoin.  It's Bitcoin at it was originally meant to be.  If anything, after segwit, btc will be the alt coin because of the fundamental changes to the blockchain
@_date: 2017-05-22 23:27:21
I don't think banks should go away.  I think we just need sound money (bitcoin).  Banks are useful to keep your money safe and to make investments.  If bitcoin because the main currency in the world, you think I'm gonna store millions of dollars in my own home where some thug can break in and kill me to steal it?  No, I'm gonna have a bank store it and protect it in a vault with armed guards.
@_date: 2017-07-09 00:32:32
Except you have to open payment channels with centralized companies to make transactions because on chain transactions are too expensive.
@_date: 2016-07-24 05:52:25
But the someone else could get your secret

That price had nothing to do with the halving
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:44:02
More users == more transactions == higher fees
We need to hard fork bigger blocks now!
@_date: 2016-07-06 22:27:44
So you can't transfer bitcoin for free?
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:47:33
I'm happy as long people have the option for transactions on chain with low fees.

@_date: 2017-06-12 13:50:24
I'm sure the crash is fixed by now right?  Better to have BU than centralized 2nd layer transactions that people are forced to use because fees are too high...

@_date: 2017-06-16 04:04:58
Well, segwit and second layer transactions ain't in the white paper so...

Im pretty sure this guy would make more money if he just bought bitcoins.  This idea is terrible and he will never get financial backing for it.  It will only benefit the customer.
