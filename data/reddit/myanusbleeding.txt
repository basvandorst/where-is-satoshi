So by 2020 we hit $10k?
@_date: 2019-11-21 21:31:36
Oh. I’m still hodling. This meme is almost a tradition during a dip.

Whoever said money can’t buy you happiness has never driven a 911.

And it just got through your dick-wall.

Don’t stop me now! ��

Wtf happened?!? We had the vegeta memes ready and everything.

Doesn’t mean you have to act like “new money.” It alienates you from your social circle, and keeps you from joining “old money” social circles because you are clearly an outsider. You don’t fit anywhere.

I will go dancing and singing in the streets if this goes down.
@_date: 2019-02-10 21:55:06
I wouldn’t advertise it like that. Kind of tasteless in my opinion and it screams “new money.”
@_date: 2019-12-10 19:06:25
What are these “friends” you speak of.
@_date: 2019-06-10 23:12:32
Cheap coins ��

Sovereignty can’t buy lambos though.
@_date: 2019-12-06 15:51:17
But that’s ten years from now...I want lambo now

Depends on whether MacAfee gets to keep his penis or not

It’s over!

Up up and away��

This is the end...my only friend, the end.
@_date: 2019-05-21 00:30:58
Yes! The question is...when (not if) we moon, how long would I hang on to it before cashing it. How many of us will really have the discipline to hodl once it skyrockets past $100k?
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:08:47
$1M is when I sell. Until then, hodl!
