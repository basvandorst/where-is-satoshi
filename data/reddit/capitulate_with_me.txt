My personal theory is is that it was never intended for alpha and the unstable beta version air qoutes not for real money end air quotes keeps developers out of legal trouble and gives the community a springboard to develop a more mature and decentralized platform.

I sell large items COD to middle aged affluent women over the phone while they view my site. Bitcoin has an unknown to slightly negative image with my clientele and near zero utility for me or my customers.  
I will say the one time I promoted bitcoin actively,  I got many scam attempts. Now I have a reason NOT to promote bitcoin or link my company on r/bitcoin. One bad review from a vindictive scammer would be devastating; look how quick you are to bring bile here.
  
Don't hate, I love bitcoin but its not right for my product just yet.

Unless you have a desireable offering for most  bitcoin users (tech, male, 18-35), don't expect much.  I have a badge on the footer of my payment page and invoices. Zero BTC payments since Nov. 2013.

You make a cash deposit into their bank account by handing the teller cash and deposit slip, no ID needed. The escrowed coins are released to your localbitcoin wallet, then you can move them to a colder wallet.

Yeah $10 worth of bitcoin on a paper wallet was more highly coveted at the white Christmas game than $20US at my rural family Christmas party.

Watching the camps violently busted live on Ustream at 3am under a nationwide and illegal order by the authorities reminds me that this won't be easy, and is worth the effort. The night of OakFoSho will be in the history books, let's make sure bitcoiners are writing those books. I'd love for you all to share links of Occupy camps being busted for hodling energy.

I will hold until as long as it takes.  I have only invested what I can afford to lose and see bitcoin as an opportunity to at least change the dialogue between the global financial hegemony and increasingly powerless individuals.

Sorry I couldn't resist.  Basically,  this dude who is a boss at some big company tweeted that he heard at a private dinner that an anticipated method of investing in bitcoin for the public will be opening in four weeks. This could be HUGE!

I bought ~.11 last night for ~$26; no stress here. Even if it goes to nothing, I will be proud to have participated (and held) in something that shook the corrupt worldwide financial hegemony.

How can I easily obtain privacy with bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:20:27
These are debunked because they rely on the mixing service to not unmask you
@_date: 2015-02-01 00:52:50
I was hoping for a revolution towards freedom, but bitcoin's (the currency's) freedom includes the caveat of no absolute privacy. Privacy is freedom in the information age in my mind. I thought "bitcoin was anonymous" when I bought originally. Now it feels like bitcoin (the currency) is just another eye for authority.
I agree it's a revolution, but are we sure it is a positive step towards freedom? Could you please expand on "revolutionary"? Do you mean politically, economically, tech, etc. Thanks! I do hold, but I'm losing trust and not because price.

Will using HD wallets, specifically Mycelium, defeat this type of monoriting?

Are you referring to darkwallet and blockchain.info's respective services?
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:36:47
 The whole point of mixers is to hide the original address. What if the tumbler is a leo honey pot? Anonymous transactions must be part of the protocol. I will not depend on anyone else to protect me.
@_date: 2015-02-02 20:48:28
All can be beat with incompetence, bad actors, warrants or one small mistake.  None are easy.   Anonymity needs to be part of the protocol.
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:50:35
I don't trust blockchain.info to keep me anonymous. They could log all that, or just be incompetent.  Dark Wallet is our best hope but I understand it is having issues with change addresses. 
Could someone please convince me that Dark Wallet is not compromised?  Must I use Darkwallet on an anon computer/connection to work, 'cuz that ain't easy!

The post title is a claim which is simply untrue. Maybe my soccer mom clientele does not want to see bitcoin "the internet drug currency" on my scented candles checkout screen. Never mind almost no one uses it IRL and setting it up does take time; business owners know time is money. I've been accepting bitcoin for two years without a single person wanting to pay in btc.  I could continue but I won't. Long term  hodler here
