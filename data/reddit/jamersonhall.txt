Seen this for the last two years.  It's obvious to anyone (except the trolls) that nobody needs every cup of coffee purchased in the world on the main chain.  I guess from the replies to this post it's going to be pretty obvious to see who are the "paid" reddit FUD posters.

Roger caused so much grief over the last 18 - 24 months.  One of 2-3 of Bitcoins most hated personalities.  Still to this day I think the guy is so out of touch that he hasn't yet realized just how much he's hated by those who are dedicating free time and money to support the long term success of Bitcoin.

These days I enjoy reading his twitter feeds as he comes out with such entertaining rubbish.

Wow Roger that's sounds like a paid troll post if I ever heard of one. Do you have any concept of the size of the time it will take to import the block chain for new nodes if the chain holds every cup of coffee.  Probably don't as it sounds like you have no concept of sidechains.

If a substantial amount then why did you use a low fee?

Don't really think this matters.  It has no usage other than speculation. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 06:09:45
A technology that the banks are looking into.  Also there's a coin but as there's no way the banks will use the coin it's basically a ponzi speculative coin which will gain the developers a huge amount of money. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 00:46:25

I have seen on this forum perhaps 20-30 reddit sock puppets that regularly post here and fit into the category of insane.  But actually more likely they are well paid as with most of the others who are trying their best to delay SegWit to the benefit of one mining group who make millions out of the delay.

People have long ago come to realize that it's not practical to store every small transaction on the blockchain that is the most secure blockchain in the world. For this reason we now have very many 2nd layers scaling solutions being tried out.  
@_date: 2017-05-03 15:43:43
I have seen very many twitter and reddit posts from developers over the last 3-4 months saying that it DOES require SegWit to work securely and efficiently.  What makes you say "it doesn't require SegWit"?

So what do you suggest as a solution?

Is that inflation constant or is there something like halving.  If it has perpetual inflation then why are people pumping up the value so much.  I don't get it.

Do you feel that someone will come up with a LN solution that does not need SegWit? With something like that I cannot see what grounds any miner would have to block SegWit as stopping implementation of LN would no longer be possible.

Your posting history shows you frequently ask questions about transaction fees and sometimes even answer them.

If the miners thought they were dealing with core they must have been dumb.  Core is 100+ developers and only a few were there to help out and give their opinion.

haha that's what I thought when I went over there a month ago.  I've not been back since.  Should be renamed to r/WeHateBTC as that's or r/WeLoveRoger  Never been back since as after checking a few posts there I felt like throwing up.

Guys like Hal make Mike, Gavin (the new Gavin), Garzic (the new Garzic), Roger, Jihan and look like the devil.  RIP Hal

Evidence about what. I think it's been very well documented over the years.

As said by a redditor who signed up 0 hours ago.

Craig Wright's presentation where he mentioned if you don't have $20K to spend on a node then "fuck off"

You sound like an ETH trader.  I am glad to know you can see into the future.  There are not many people who can guarantee things will happen.

Why would you have "lost a lot of money" with the BTC trend being in the upward direction this last 18 months.  Also this is the second (or maybe 3rd) time you have made this kind of post and your positing history suggests to me that your postings about confirmation are spam.

Thanks for your very helpful article which I am sure will be trashed by many trolls as possible here.  Keep up the good work.

If Bitmain wanted SegWit they could signal tomorrow.  Please explain why they are not doing that or ask your boss to explain it all for us.

Barry Silbert cares about making money for himself and doesn't seem to care about the long term future of bitcoin.  He reminds me of Roger.  Alan Silbert (his brother) seems to care a lot more about the Bitcoin community and the long term future of bitcoin.

Yeah HF so that in one year the blocks are full again.  No thanks.  This 40 billion dollar blockchain is not there to record the purchase of a donut and coffee.

Can you tell me which government has the power to shut down miners and exchanges in every country of the world. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 05:48:41
You want Segwit2x that not a single core developer thinks is a good idea but you don't want SegWit which every core developer says is a good idea and which could be implemented immediately.  Sounds like you're working for Roger.
@_date: 2017-06-04 04:15:54
Jihan does not care for one second on how much you respect him.  He makes more money by holding off on SegWit and having big blocks. It's as simple as that.

I wonder if you are working for a company.  If so then let me know the name of the company then I'll use their products and then call the company to have you fired. If you fail to understand what I just said then sorry about that.  You clearly are not the most brightest of the bunch.

From what I understand bitcoin costs 90-95% of the current price in electricity to power computing servers.  If it goes to $500 the miners would stop production very quickly.  Ethereum is the opposite, costs very little to produce.  Remember the hash / computing power required to create a bitcoin is around 120,000 times that to create Ether right now.
@_date: 2017-06-04 04:17:29
You're funny.  Do you think a few devs and miners signing something makes and agreement.  If you think that then you don't understand anything at all about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:39:48
I would love to know the answer to this too.  As Jihan has said for them to go ahead and block ASICBOOST the core devs are not helping the situation by not implementing this change. It's the first time the core devs have disappointed me.  Something here they could do that everyone has said is okay, that would help the situation and they do nothing :-(
