Do segwit adresses look different so you can distinguish it? Can something go wrong if you send a segwit transaction to a non segwit compatible wallet?

But also the standards are nowadays much different.. Then you just built it somehow together, some water pipes, electricity and voila... Now you have thermal and static calculations, energy optimization, cancer free materials, regulations on how to built it without people dying, tools which are approved for safe handling, databases to keep track of what is going on in the city that need to be maintained and much much more...

Bitcoin inflation doesn't work with having a limited supply but by increasing the tx fee. This has the same effect from a economical standpoint. It was predicted that the free market will solve this type of sound to unsound money problem by itself (which it didn't yet).
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:30:55
The protocol supports arbitrary splitting of BTC, currently one millionth is the limit which could be changed to trillionth or smaller any time.
However the current high tx fees leed to a economic inflation while the entire BTC supply is still limited.

In an unregulated markets its wild wild west and all the scams you see today were used in the old days of classic trading until it got regulated.
In any case this is also the problem why ETFs couldn't be established yet, as there is no reliable way to assure the correct value of bitcoin. There are quite regulated exchanges, but with arbitrage trading a manipulation from outside will find its way into the regulated system. Boom - you have the problem of a regulated etf market which can be manipulated.
Quite some way to go.

How does a dispute work with Fiat money? 
@_date: 2019-03-13 13:03:03
The loophole is that central banks only have the monopoly for physical cash. &gt;90% of cash is created by regular banks virtually where this monopol does not apply.
Some concepts suggest the monopol should be extended as in the old times virtual money did not exist and created this loophole.
It would mean that the large virtual interest rates would go to the public bank instead of regular banks.
Translated Wikipedia to see the full benefits of the system and how massive this loophole is:

However Satoshi is not the smallest amount set in stone. The protocol allows further unit diving if necessary in the future.

So just for a bank? What will a bitcoin holder do during that time? With US 350m userbase  and the triple throughput we can access it once every six months. Not sure if this is the right use case for those times, there might be better scenarios that only this system can deal with.
@_date: 2018-10-27 13:24:22
Exactly, you need someone who people tend to be already connected (locally for an example a pizza place where everyone buys regularly) and who can afford the channel insurance (banks, governments).
So the largest channel provider gets the highest fee returns and grows even larger. Therefore the largest grows also the fastest - somehow I see something in common with the current system.
@_date: 2018-10-27 18:11:46
Yes better explanation. I thought the multiplication come from cascading instead of using the debt as deposit.
@_date: 2018-10-27 15:46:38
Let me make my example more concrete, maybe I missed your point. 
With fiat institutions can lend approx. 10 times as much as one own.
Bank A owns 10 Fiat, this means they can lend 100 fiat to bank B, C and D while holding the 10% security according to the regulations. Bank B, C and D now repeat it.
That the leverage effect. Working with money you don't own (yet). Same when you build the house today to use it's benefit right now while you will have the full sum in 20yrs. The money to pay for the compound interest money you get from the future money that will be printed.
Lending bitcoin they don't own seems still doable. If you make enough fiat money you buy more bitcoin by the additional money you make to compensate. The right amount is surely limited because of the underlying limited supply of bitcoin - but it will work for some time. Maybe there are also tools to exclude the problem and push it to the lenders side away from the bank (limited shorting/ hedging or similar constructs) 
@_date: 2018-10-27 08:20:41
This is a major problem I see in general. With banks this would not happen. They would pull of other stuff like fees and shit but what is yours stays the same unless you have a failing state. Somehow people forget the probability of loosing the private key is magnitudes higher than a failing first world state. There are other cases as well, however risk-adjusted it is still like a said. 
Maybe the adoption will be somewhere in the middle. Goldman Sachs is on the creation of the first billion dollar wallet to tackle exactly those high risk areas. For this amount of money you buy a hijacking squad to get each puzzle part of the private key.
Long time nobody was sure what the internet is, a modern fax machine, a digital dictionary, a new phone and adress book until it became something new as today. I see it will go the same way for crypto.

It would make sense, nobody pulls out more than 5% of the holdings at the same time... After the stability regulations they have to keep much more, think 8-10% or so.
This would make sense with crypto as well. Lend 10x more than you have and cash in the  interests. Then buy more crypto with the winnings and depending on the risk affinity buy more crypto so in case of the crash you have enough or nearly enough to cover 80-100% of crypto.
Without the coin printing machine it seems debt stacking is difficult, like keeping 10% and giving 90% out to the next bank which repeats the game (fiat like). 
Not doing this would lead to not beeing able to compete. So the underlying asset of crypto doesn't even matter in the end anymore.

Now tried it after the chinese investigations, and guess what: Tried 5 different services to get my money in, all of them wanted the KYC id scans and whatsoever information and then after unlocking the classical wire transfer takes days - or with CC they even want more scans (residency, passport) from you [europe].

Thank you for promoting it in the earlier years. Because of people like you it become large. Don't beat yourself up, the equivalent would have been to rebuy for the same Fiat amount. You were willing to donate x amount of Fiat equivalent in bitcoin which you did.
If people want to donate using btc they can simply rebuy instantly afterwards. It's just the same.

Maybe I miswrote it, I am aware that they didn't steal because of a bitcoin protocol error.
Just that in whatever form a wallet is given, it will be the main point of attack. Not having someone who will be on your side to cover your losses because it was a scam will be a problem.

Exchanging it for an other good is the same as selling. But what store of value do you have if you can't exchange the value. Doesn't make any sense.
It's a tool and holding your baseline allows you to hold, while at the same time use it a real exchange with any additional fund on top of that baseline. We wouldn't be there were we are now if everyone just holds instead of showing how it can be used and making sure it gets used.
You wouldn't store gold if you never fear you could use it one day, then you could also just throw it away and remove it permanently from the world market - just the same as infinite holding.

Risk is primarily measure with volatility. The reason is that it is a mathematical tool. In case of a legal dispute is super clear that the advisor used a neutral tool which, with the information given at that time, was objectively.
At the beginning you need to declare your risk affinity. If you say low and they give you bitcoin they got a problem. If they recommend a sure bet which will rise but is super volatile they will not do it. With a matematical tool you have a super easy way to prove that you gave neutral informations about the asset according to the wishes of the customer.
For the highest risk classes you need to sign special documents to prove you know and understand what you are doing. For CFD with possible looses larger than 100% you need even more signatures and with CFD high risk/leverage you need to proof further experience.
**In short**: Its mostly about liability and volatility is king (analysists statements not so much)
What I wonder is what will happen when bitcoin goes to the CFD shortly. Bitcoin is not regulated, and price manipulation is legal. But CFD is clearly regulated and inside trading strictly forbidden - no idea how they think this will fit together.

I think he means Bayes in terms of conditional probability, where "suing" is a subconditon of both cases real and fake Satoshi Nakamoto.
It's a bit tricky because the assumptions are not known, Satoshi could also be a group with divided interests or conflict of interests.
Bayesian reasoning can be interesting for probabilities of other already low probabilities (or reversed). Like saliva tests, low error of margin but large number of people - your brain will trick you into a false result seeing the cool numbers like 99.99% and thinking it's "safe". If you draw a rectangle with divided areas (small part / larger part) you tend to immediately grasp if the result would be immensivly large or small (against your thinking).

The last paragraph was baysian in general. To give an example for the trickyness:
Drunk drivers  
 
A group of police officers have breathalyzer displaying false drunkenness in 5% of the cases in which the driver is sober. However, the breathalyzers never fail to detect a truly drunk person. One in a thousand drivers is driving drunk. Suppose the police officers then stop a driver at random, and force the driver to take a breathalyzer test. It indicates that the driver is drunk. We assume you don't know anything else about him or her. How high is the probability he or she really is drunk?
Many would answer as high as 95%, but the correct probability is about 2%.

A new form of attack is to shotgut free bitcoins (parts of cents) to many adresses in use. If those parts are merged together, as a wallet does, you know it's one single person having those adresses.

Especially because he was able to rebuy immediately. So the pizza deal cost him 1:1 to Dollar (max the bitcoin value oscillation between spending bitcoin and rebuying).
For adoption we need a flow, no hodling. Like spend and rebuy, spend and rebuy.. So it's 1:1 if it's not having a +-20% in 1h price change of course.

How do they track the correct price?
All other ETFs (correctly) failed because averaging many exchanges is not counterfighting market manipulation and insider trading - a necessity of establishing an ETF (at least in US and EU, as far i could understand from reading the official report).

What I like about it, its that bitcoin is to the greatest part no completely new invention but the assembly of existing parts was unique and a mindset changer. This fits right in the sweetspot of new-to-reuse ratio of other large technologies that had a huge impact. 
For the future what I wonder is if game theory wise the different incentives between miners and user will work out. I think it will be difficult to get away from mining not technology wise but incentive wise. Or like the statement here, those large miners might approach the critical 35yrs and a change will be difficult.

Thanks, yes I especially like the proposal to separate the pool from the decision what tx to include. Maybe difficult regarding game theory but I think it would give power to the people and improve decentralization while keeping it simple with pools.
Growing eventually sounds already infinity better than those maximlist to never ever change it no matter what. It enforces keeping it small for hard drives but the door for improvement is still kept open. Small players should not left behind with high tx fees, but miners also need a fair reward.

What few here like to hear is the following:
There is no need for banks to fear it, as bitcoin is designed to never be able to replace the fiat money on a national, country or international base covering a large portion of the GOP to be even remotely relevant.
What makes it special is also what limit its usability for broad use and that is the limited amount of coins which would mean massive deflation problems with people having no food as a daily life impact - No need to relive the deflation scenario one more time XD well you can guess who has the longest staying power for that, and in the end those buy whole streets for a goldcoin - it's a loose loose. 
However we will feel the benefit of the new system:

You describe it really binary all or nothing and I see your point. Do you think the first product will be the way to go forever? I mean with gold the first attempt was surly the shiny rock with some gold particles in it, but now most value today is stored in a solid bar. The raw material is still precious but hardly accessible. 
I furthermore like the idea of a global experiment. With high value I definitely want on chain confirmation for myself, but if billions use it worldwide I might only can access it once every decade. I simply don't understand why the white paper considers everything to grow over time (hash rate, adoption, halving), but the block size is static forever.
I mean doubling it with each halving wouldn't have hurt as it's still very conservative curve, but at least it is a curve. Other than that I see that even if it would be better (assumption), it would be still a economic dilemma for those who mine. I likely would not switch over my hashing power but keep things like they are.
What is your viewpoint?

I found this quite interesting so I add what I learned :) 
Actually this is one of the few market segments that work very little like that. The natural very limited availability of space make the property to one of the most inelastic goods (change of demand is only weakly connected to a change of supply). That and other reasons makes real estate a kind of natural monopol. 
So in the end you cannot build infinite amount of real estate and hope that that drives the prices down. Therefore the regulation is necessary and like you can see some attempts work better than others depending on where you life... 
The easiest way is to build social housing (governmental or for example large investors need to keep a certain percentage of the area within the cities demands instead of speculating ), preventing empty flats, regulations,... 
Measuring the success of this, all large European cites pretty much fail, only Vienna is to some extent good at retaining a good balance. Another example is Singapor, where the space is so ultra limited and there is a great accumulation of financial capital. There you can only by a housing for ~ 90yrs before it goes back to the state (enough for three generations). This is one of the attempts to prevent the youth from emigrating while allowing them to buy housing and start a family and work in Singapore, which the city in the long term depends on. 
Annother segment with similar behavior is energy (natural market entry obstacles) , however this has opened up to a certain degree due to renewable energies...

One correction to it, in time of a crisis precious metals, especially gold don't provide a safe harbor like people like to believe. (Unless you go to barter trades and you fight for food.) Check the graphs. Gold did worse than some other classic investment. 
Crisis is pretty much the definition that the correlation of everything goes towards 1 and behaves in a similar fashion.
That's also the reason why rich people can buy, even though their assets are totally down. The rich only leave all others behind in times of crisis, in times of booms they have the same opinions as everyone else and grow similar like the rest.

Couldn't find it anywhere... Could you theoretically skip the wall by paying more? I thought the price chart would show the last sell price so it could jump above 3000 without using the wall first?? 
And one more question: is this market depth one platform only or somehow exchanged in the trading of all bitcoins? Because then the wall would only exist on one platform and others could go higher until they make new accounts and get verified and stuff to gt them cheaper on exactly this platform with wall?? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:29:05


What do I keep a eye on - just the numbers or anything particular to see how these tricks are used?
Don't you likely loose money by building a wall? Sure, its scares people away, but then? Sooner or later it will fall and then many of those Bitcoins could have been sold as a much higher price instead...
Or where is the magic to win money with walls?
