bullshit charges?  let's recap:
* there are anti-money laundering (AML) regulations put in place by the federal government.  read: this is the law.
* sherm broke above referenced law by telling customers how to avoid the AML regulations *that he put in place*

This is factually wrong.  The US treasury is governed by Congress.  The US treasury only works with the Federal Reserve Bank, a privately owned bank.  In order for the Fed to work with the USG via the Treasury, they must follow rules enforced by the Treasury created by Congress.  The Fed has 12 banks in separate regions. All other private banks conduct banking activity via the regional Fed Bank.  In order for a private bank to legally work with fractional reserves they must follow rules established by the fed bank which are established by the Treasury.
Now how does this all come together?  Congress allows loans which create money (interest paid vs bank reserves) within certain rules.  This is why banks were helpless in 2008 until the treasury stepped in with a series of loans.
Don't like this? Write your senator and state Representative.  Don't expect instant change bcause this system has worked for 100 years.

Internet is universal, why is there a great firewall of China?  Bitcoin is universal, why do some countries ban it's use?  Guns are universal, why are there restrictions based on the State, Province, and Country?  Maybe Somali will allow exchanges without demanding transparency, security, and audits.. and good for them, their economy could use the boost.  
Politicians work for their constituents.  You can write your politician and get a response.  You can write Karples and Shrem and never hear back from them, ever.  However you are correct, other countries may put more regulations on bitcoin (like China).. but I think it's safe to start saying that less regulations (like Japan) means riskier business (like MtGox). 
Makes you wonder about BTC-E or some of those other cryptocurrency trading platforms (Cryptsy?)

You don't think any of those 744k of stolen bitcoins were used for daytrading?  What is the purpose of MtGox again?  What do you do when you day trade?  You act on fluctuations in price. How can you turn a profit if you can't buy and sell on demand?  Wait 30 minutes for 3 confirmations and then get in on the last 2% of the 10% profit gains?
You sound like you are knee-jerk thinking this only halfway through.  Yes you remove your funds when you're not trading, but when there are sometimes 15% price movements at 2am.. well.. are you going to keep your funds idle when your goal is to day trade?
Okay we covered the reason for keeping funds with a 3rd party *exchange*.  So are you implying that day traders should be OK with the risk that the exchange can poof and vanish over night?  In that case, why should anyone adopt bitcoin as a commodity if it's inherently risky to trade?

Dude, listen to yourself.  Socialized losses, no market incentive?  This is starting to sound like a borderline loony liberal rant.  There are roughly 20 large banks in the united states (based on physical bank location count of &gt;100).  This does not include credit unions, this does not include independent banks (such as Ally).  How is this worse than agriculture where there are only 7 major companies handling your food distribution?  In fact, there is one company that dominates 66% of the market.  Now is it the banks fault that a gallon of milk costs $4 or the argiculture industry's fault?  Your example of socialized losses means we should do away with government handouts on corn and wheat.  While we're at it, let's also do away with hiding socialized losses when your housing structure catches fire from a poor electrical installation and burns down.  Now it's your problem (and your neighbors, and potentially your city) when a fire breaks out.  Because lol socialized losses are a 20th century problem. 
What I'm saying is you are quick to blame banks because oooh they're evil, but *this is what capitalism does*.  The best survives, the rest die.  If Sysco went under today, the US would be FUCKED when it comes to food.  Would you expect the government to sit back and say "ahh should have seen it comin, we grow our own plants" while you're unable to find any food within 150 miles of your city?  But at the same time, do you really WANT the government to take over Sysco's or ConAgra's job of shipping food around the country?  Just step into a post office or check out your local TSA security line or any social security/welfare office around the states for a preview of what happens when the government takes over.
Then again maybe you do what that in your country.  Go check out Sudan if you want a functional anarchy.  Go check out France if you want functional socialism.  Come back to the US when you want a blend of the two, but it's going to bounce back and forth because there are no lines drawn in the sand denoting where regulation starts/stops so TL;DR... get over it?

No, I think this is where your understanding may be incorrect. Speculators are not okay with things when bitcoin prices are up.  Speculators know that investing is a zerosum game.  Which means if you make money, someone is losing money and vice versa.  Speculators are not okay with is risk and as prices skyrocket in the wild-wild-west well.. things begin to look risky but the profits are outweighing the risk.  If exchanges solvency are at risk when prices start to drop, then wouldn't that give them a valid reason to lose their respective shit?
I think about my father's entry point to Bitcoin.  I purposefully never mentioned it to him.  He heard about it on the news.  If he were to research bitcoin using google, what would he find? If he were to simply google "trade bitcoin", the first exchange is Gox.  That's some great Search Engine Optimization which hints at the size behind Mtgox.  No where in any of these steps is a "Warning: bitcoin may lose all value".  
Let's go back to stupid people.  There are no warning signs, what would a stupid person do?
Now, do you want mass adoption of bitcoin for stability or do you want this to be an innovative, decentralized, playground of value volatility?  Stupid people are losing their shit, because stupid people lost their shit.  There are a lot of stupid people.  Ergo, it sounds like you would rather an innovative playground (which the other cryptocurrencies 
provide a market for!) instead of stable adoption.

not all the time, for instance there is the small business administration which puts wealth into places where wealth does not exist.  there is the SEC which limits power where power already exists.
there are edge cases which don't get caught, such as the HSBC debacle and the whole LIBOR thing.. but at the same time there are tons of executives of OTC companies that are busted by the SEC for insider trading doing almost exactly what mtgox is doing (see STBV$ for a prime example of this).  then there's bernie madoff, the savings &amp; loan scandal etc which are huge fraud cases and do get caught.

Right, because they couldn't borrow money.  Thus when they ran out of bitcoins they are fucked and instead of lower class we have homeless class.  The lower middle class will now be the true lower class.  This may be a reason why the political leadership are embracing bitcoin.  Imagine if bitcoin is for people who don't have credit.  The ruling class still uses USD and the 1% bitcoiners can transfer between their true wealth and investing in controlling the homeless class.  I like where this is going, better hoard btc now.

Coinbase will also randomly give you bitcoins and withdraw money from your bank account.  Are there even any other USD-&gt;BTC options that are as easy as coinbase (read they must have ACH, and allow applicants from any state in the US)?
Now that we have established there are none, isn't Coinbase a huge freaking weak point?  My theory: a big hack/government intervention will stop coinbase from converting usd to btc.  BTC price will skyrocket, then drop when the realization occurs there are no more convenient ways to get usd to btc.

Except overstock as an investment vehicle is a horrible idea.  They are frequently targeted by short sales and have invoked the ire of Mad Money Jim Cramer as well as many hedge fund managers.  Please search for the overstock ceo's rant on this topic during one of their quarterly shareholder calls (i have faith you will find it).  You can see this is still in effect when their stock dropped 25% immediately after posting a $70m (over 60%) increase in profits *last quarter*.  Bitcoin will not be Overstock's saviour...
Due Dilegence.  That is why stock markets are a better investment opportunity than the random wtf rollarcoaster that is bitcoin.

First off, my family has immigrated to this country and are doing just fine for being here for 70 years.  Then there's me, who literally walked out of my parent's door with $0, had nothing to rely on and I made my way to solid upper-middle class.  I don't know how devaluing the dollar by 95% is bad thing when it has worked for myself and everyone else I have crossed paths with.. 
Now if your argument is why should we work when the dollar could be 95% stronger, then I'm sorry I misinterpreted your comment.  Yes the dollar has been devalued, but that's also because the power of the dollar has become stronger.  How about this, why don't you show me a situation where we don't devalue a monetary base in modern history.  Or provide better analytical points that show how screwed we are.

problem is, you would be sharing time with other tasks.  at the time our cluster was probably 80% unused during prime time and over 95% unused on weekends (we also used to run quake on our production oracle server but that was in the BOFH days).  before i left, nasa was expressing interest in using our cluster for small simulations.  today they have a pretty hefty compute cluster that's being used by several government agencies and private companies.  mining  bitcoin would quickly show up on the accounting list, but they likely allow something like 5-10% to be used for personal projects.  you'd get more juice out of a cuda cluster (which they are working on but computing time will likely be sold to the business/finance department for simulations and testing theoretical models)

Right, and today people utilize their limited credit to overdraw their account.  They can't leave that bank until they pay off that debt or have their credit marked.  But when their next pay check is $150 less, dont they have to overdraw again?  Bitcoin doesn't allow you to overdraft their wallet, so wouldn't that mean they wouldn't have access to easy credit?  Thus pushing middle class even further out of reach?

This is all information they already know.  What can they do about it, make an order from the vendor and hope the vendor is careless and uses their real name/address?
Lastly, why would you use your own address/own name?  That would open your personal property to the evil civil forfeiture laws that reddit has come to hate.  Wouldn't it be smarter to use a friend's address or to rent a private office?

The corporations and their owners want money.  So it sounds like we are at a cross roads.  Regulate and create agencies which can manage all of the things companies should manage (roads, municipal safety, money, food, etc).. or No regulations and deal with companies like MtGox and Lehman Brothers.. but at least when they fail, they'll take the hard working people with them.

Also your debit card doesn't pull, your debit card pushes as well.  Swiping your credit card is an action to conduct a transaction.  Scanning a QR code is just a different kind of action.

But let's go back.  You don't think Karples or any owner of businesses which failed, have any money saved?   You are mistaken if you think the profits of the company directly translate to the owners wealth.  Just like stocks, they are unrealized until they take them out.  In the meantime, just like stocks, you can get paid dividends, or a portion of the quarterly/yearly profit relative to your ownership.  So Karples could be sitting on over $100m personally, you don't know.  
We let Gox flameout.  You don't think Karples could be an angel investor in another exchange?  There aren't many bitcoin exchanges, so he brings relevant experience to the table.  That next exchange could blow up just as well.  So who's left holding the bag here, the shit company with shit technology, negative capital, or the users who put their money into this shit company not knowing truely how shitty it was until the end?  
If this is history and it is just destined to  always repeat itself, wouldn't that decimate the confidence of exchanges since you wouldn't know when an exchange is going to fail (e.g. a webserver going down could cause a panic run on the exchange)?

you said there are others. let's pick one.  cell phones and other disposable technology.  we use resources to create the technology that may only be used a handful of times, then we toss it into the ground polluting land and water. we charge them constantly which is additional energy consumption and pollution.  we can combat this by recycling and reusing and making more efficient devices.
let's look at web server/graphics/database farms.  they once were computers that ran at full steam regardless of utilization.  we have advanced energy efficiency by reducing computers to specific tasks (eg cuda farms for graphic rendering), we have advanced software design to dynamically scale systems (eg AWS, azure, vmware etc) and consume less energy, etc.
bitcoin.  we recycle our hardware, that's it.  we still create (pollution + waste during creation) these asic miners that will serve no purpose after 6mo (more waste, though it could be recycled).  the motivation is to continue increasing computing power solely for the purpose of decentralizing an authority. this means no power management except use all that is available to me.  am i wrong?
what common energy use can you provide that is wasteful and trivial?  more food for thought: we banned incandescent lights for more efficient energy use.  how can we make bitcoin more energy efficient?

Hmm it's negligent.  Which means you could be at risk for what, being sued?  Which what, increases your liability?  
When you run a exchange, you are allowing people to trade USD for BTC (or other commodities, currencies, etc).  If one of the risks behind using an exchange is that *it will vanish overnight* then that's a pretty big liability, no?
Let's go back to the spinning blades (just want to take time out to point out something i noticed about you, which is that you assumed i was talking about a fan and not a diamond cutter, or skillsaw).  If it's such a major risk to negligently walk into spinning blades, then why would the government force you to put up warning signs about the blade?  Because the government doesn't want you to unilaterally walk into a spinning blade.  (wouldn't you say that *you* chose to walk into spinning blades that's directly in front of you, no one put a gun to your head and said MAKE CONTACT WITH THAT SPINNING THING IN FRONT OF YOU)?
Follow me back to MtGox again, wouldn't the government want to protect you from unilaterally putting your money into something that would up and vanish over night?  $300m is a lot of money.  Japan failed in protecting it's companies and citizens.  By the end of 2014, if an independent regulation comission for exchanges doesn't appear, the US will have something in place to ensure this massacre doesn't happen to US-based exchanges.

if we don't raise the debt ceiling it just means we cannot take on any new debt.  that is it.  it means all those other countries who look to us for money can't get it.  we will still issue and pay back t-bonds, we will still pay our government employees.

i can easily create a fake bitcoin, but you can catch it fairly easily.  i can easily create a fake dollar, but you may not always catch it easily.
you are also saying that satoshi dice needs to rely on an authority.  if ghash.io takes 51% computing power, then ghash.io can determine that satoshi dice can be double-spent against.  there is nothing that satoshi dice can do about that but leave bitcoin.  if that can happen to satoshi dice, then what's stopping the same from happening to overstock?
they won't be *a* central authority, they will have majority control of the authority. which is no different than a major national bank having more money than smaller banks and thus controlling who gets loaned money, for example
please, take an objective look at this.  i agree bitcoins cannot be counterfeited, however you have the double spend problem which dollars don't have.  you can't say bitcoins are great because they cannot be counterfeit when the DS problem clearly exists.  you cannot say dollars are great because you cannot double spend them when the counterfeit problem clearly exists.

A tool that can break out of VMWare may not be able to break out of Xen, Qemu, VirtualBox, etc.  A tool that can break out and attack a Windows host will be useless against a Linux, FreeBSD, or Solaris system.

i'm sorry but isn't finding a block == transactions?  therefore if i am confirming blocks, then i am always gauranteed to confirm a transaction. therefore person b (from above example) would have to wait until i confirmed.  that may just take a very long time, but it would gaurantee person A with 75% would not domininate by computing all of the blocks

If you think $6 for a prepaid card is bad, wait until you see the fees buying a TV or anything over $500.  Imagine when you are 30 and gas costs $10/gal.  You fill up, it costs $150.  Four times a month, that's $600.  Let's assume a low 1% fee.  That's $6 fee per month if you paid with bitcoin.  But that's not all, butcoin is a democratic society, everyone must pay fees.  That's $6 the gas station owner pays as well.  Makes prepaid cards sound wonderful, no?

if i understand you correctly, if someone were to take on say 75% of the network, they could make transactions permanent along with the owners of the rest of the 25%.  and then if person b wanted to confirm transactions on the network and needed to wait for 2 confirmations (from two seperate blocks) it is near impossible for person A with 75% of the computing power to confirm those transactions because the other 25% would be gauranteed a block to confirm?  wow! bitcoin is amazing, thanks for the explanation! 
i guess i should start mining then, i thought it would become progressively difficult to mine a bitcoin with so much compute power on the network.  thanks!

Punishment also happens under the watch of the SEC and the CFTC.  
Personally i think the exchanges need to come together and self-regulate and be proactive.  Kinda like airline companies until the end of the 20th century.  They made an effort at security, but 9/11 proved they didn't *want* to regulate security and now we have the TSA.  So, it's your choice.  Keep trading unregulated securities on unregulated exchanges and witness the birth of a bitcoin TSA... or ask your exchange to get together with other exchanges to begin the regulatory standard.

once upon a lifetime, we had some 400 old computers just sitting around with no purpose but to be sent to property control for destruction/sales.  instead of dumping them, we overloaded all of our circuits in our building and setup a giant computing cluster (think google in the early stanford days).  we then "leased" out free time to entreprenuring students.  we also fired up a fat digital library test on it.  i would not be surprised if our next-gen cluster was used for bitcoin mining.  infiband interconnects allowed for very highspeed inter-cluster transfers, which dwarfed any gpu rig at the time.  long story short, universities have a lot of money and computing time.

Now, usually, you learn from these failures and you make the next company better.. but no one is holding a gun to your head saying you have to.  So let me ask you again, how does bailing out a bank allow incompetence to thrive when that same incompetence that ran the company can likely start a new one regardless if they are bailed out or not?

And everyone else around goes "shoulda seen the warning signs, I went to a smaller bank long ago."  But who am I kidding, life will go on.  Just like it did during the Great Depression.  Banks closed their doors and motherfucks were poor for a very long time.
I don't think you have realized that whole 2006-2008 fiasco could very easily have brought about the next Great Depression.  Imagine if all you had available was the money in your wallet, and a limit of $500 to withdraw from your ATM or bank account.  Your investments and, with it, the stock market loses 70%.

You don't have to worry about fraud, as long as your wallet is safe, and if you're a business owner you don't have to worry about chargebacks.  You should be aware of any company that accepts bitcoin that isn't legitimate and if you put your bitcoins there then it's your fault.  So we don't have any sympathy for you"

let me expound on this a bit more.
without banks, if you have all your wealth in bitcoin and someone stole your bitcoin (or your house burned down your paper wallet), you would have no money.  let me repeat that, you will have no way of getting your money back.  i don't know about you, but that invalidates bitcoin for a lot of people to "use as their own bank".  at least if the usd fucks up, the government will stand in and try to help maintain status quo.  if the banks were't bailed in 2008, we would be sitting shitty right now.  bitcoin may help supplement the usd, but it's not replacing it.  just like how the stock market did not replace the gold brick.

correction.  you need a license if you accept or distribute over $1000 per day per individual.  this means, if you run a walmart and sell a tv for BTC equivilant of $1001, you must be a licensed money transmitter (you deal in USD as well as BTC).  
if you run bitbuy.com and sell a tv for BTC equivilent of $1001, you need not be a licensed money transmitter as you are not converting from BTC to USD.  Furthermore, bitbuy.com is not required to identify who the BTC was sent to (say refund, overpay, pay to employees/owners).  However individuals must report the BTC to USD transactions with the IRS. 
There is a greyarea, as the goevrnment requires you to pay your employees a wage.  The wage is subject to withholdings.  If you withhold, it must be in USD. If you pay more than $1000/day, you must register as a money transmitter
