iOS 7.1 is the current version and I simply didn't think to change the SDK down to 7.0 when I built Coin Pocket.
I can resubmit it as a 7.0 app.
@_date: 2014-05-09 00:27:53
That's a good idea. I'll try to remember to add a FAQ on the GitHub wiki.

I should've mentioned that I'm the developer of Coin Pocket.
I glanced through that link, and yes it uses some of those HTML5 features including local storage and application cache. The local storage means that your encrypted private key is stored in Safari and not on any server. You can close Safari and restart your device. It'll be there when you go back to the site. The application cache lets you use Coin Pocket even if the server is down since all of the code is cached in Safari.

Blockchain.info's qr code scanner is not native. You have to take a picture of the QR code and then hope the picture is clear enough to be scanned. It can take a few tries.
@_date: 2014-07-29 14:42:23
Copay is still vulnerable to malicious code updates, but since it is open source you can verify the code and host it yourself. Then you would have to manually review updates before updating your version of Copay.

I'll take a look into minimal-ui. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-04-17 01:28:57
I was able to reproduce this by putting Safari in private browsing mode. Coin Pocket won't continue because private browsing won't allow websites to store any data.

I recommend backing up to iTunes or iCloud until the performance update gets approved. Another option is to send the funds to the HTML5 version of CoinPocket at  Viewing the private key there should take just a few minutes.

Hey, that's me and my app.
I did a short presentation about Coin Pocket at Bitcoin Boulevard in Cleveland Heights. Check it out here:  (I start around 34:00)

The instructions for backup might not be clear. You backup Coin Pocket however you do backups for your device. For iOS, you can do an iTunes or iCloud backup.
Android should work if you use Chrome.
Other bar code scanners don't have the ability to work with HTML5 apps.
The random entropy collector continuously reads your device's movements. The bar should eventually fill up.
@_date: 2014-06-16 14:04:42
Exciting times ahead!
I wanted to address some known issues of CoinPocket:
- BIP38 is slow. Really slow. I'm working on it.
- QR codes that contain the bitcoin: protocol are not scannable. This was fixed and resubmitted to the App Store. Keep an eye out for the update in a week or so. Follow  on twitter for news on updates.
@_date: 2014-05-07 02:07:32
Scanning QR codes with HTML5 is possible, but not that easy. You have to take a picture of it and hope it scans.
I developed Scan Code along with Coin Pocket. Scan Code works seamlessly as you would expect. Here's a demo 
@_date: 2014-05-07 02:24:40
Scan Code is not open source, but there's no reason why it can't be. I'll post it when I get the chance.
Feel free to send a pull request. If I don't accept it, you could always run your own customized version of Coin Pocket :)
@_date: 2014-04-28 18:05:00
That's why you're encouraged to backup and to practice restoring from that backup before adding funds. This is a side effect of not relying on a third party service that you have to authenticate with to store your keys. Your funds are only available in that browser for that device. This is as close as we can get to a native app on iOS.
I reported the issue of the browser data getting cleared between iOS updates to Apple. Hopefully they'll do something about it.
Merchants can receive Bitcoin like everyone else, but Coin Pocket doesn't do anything to detect double spends. I'll consider it for a future version.
@_date: 2014-05-31 06:07:42
Web clips (home screen apps without Safari interface elements) have their own data. You could have 10 web clips of Coin Pocket and therefore 10 different addresses. This is neat, but this causes a problem with the QR code scanner. If you tried to use the QR code scanner from a web clip, it'll scan into Safari instead of the web clip. This was really confusing so I disabled it.
tl;dr You can bookmark it to the home screen, but it'll launch Safari.

I'd like to add that Coin Pocket is cached in the browser, so you can still access it if the server goes down. You could run it on your own server just long enough to load it up on your phone. You can still get to it after you take your server down. You won't get any code updates obviously, so you should watch the repo ( if you do this.

I'm the developer of CoinPocket.
My intentions are not malicious, but you're right. Don't load a ton of money into CoinPocket (or any hot wallet). It is for spending amounts. Keep your investment amounts offline. I would recommend keeping small amounts of Bitcoin on paper wallets and sweeping them when you need it. I personally just buy more from Coinbase when I need to top off my wallet.
I've spent a lot of time working on this and I'm not making any money. Gaining credibility and building my resume is more important to me in the long run.
@_date: 2014-06-01 02:30:01
You private key in the browser will get cleared with it. You should always have a backup if you keep a balance. It should be clear to make a backup when you first setup Coin Pocket.
@_date: 2014-04-17 01:22:37
Once the page loads, there's nothing else to do from the server.
I use Coin Pocket with iOS 7.1 on an iPhone 5s as well... it only takes about a second for me.
Can you check your settings for Safari? Block Cookies maybe? Coin Pocket doesn't use cookies, but it does use local storage to store data in Safari.
@_date: 2014-05-24 13:39:37
I was able to reproduce it.
The private key format from bitaddress.org is not always compatible for some reason. I'll try to track down the issue and publish another update. Thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2014-04-28 18:23:37
Thanks! I'm definitely trying of thinking of good ways of doing safe backups that are easy to restore. I'll consider the mnemonic approach.
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:25:34
I released a beta of my HTML5 wallet yesterday: 
It uses a native QR Code reader on iOS.
It is in beta, and it has been having problems with Blockchain.info's API today (other apps are having problems with them too). I'm working on integrating with other APIs now.
@_date: 2014-06-16 16:33:12
It is possible, but performance and making sure the current features are solid are higher priority.
@_date: 2014-05-07 02:49:19
I wanted to keep things safe and simple, so I actually don't trust the user with their private key. Instead of moving the private key to another wallet, they could just send the funds. Sending should always be possible as long as there's a connection to either Blockchain.info or helloblock.io. Coin Pocket will continue to work even if its own server goes offline.
Backups is something that is being worked on. It'll most likely be an encrypted backup to email. An advanced user may be able to get the raw private key out of it.
@_date: 2014-05-07 04:57:50
Coin Pocket is a single address wallet, so one backup is enough. I'd like to implement BIP32 for better privacy in the future.
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:42:32
I'm the developer of Coin Pocket.
I solved the problem with scanning QR Codes with HTML5 wallets. I made a native QR Code scanner app for iOS that can be launched from a link. Other wallets can use it too.
I plan to launch this current version out of beta soon! Please try it out and give feedback!
@_date: 2014-05-08 23:42:31
Hey, I maintain the main Coin Pocket repo and 
I saw your pull request, and I'm looking through it now. I'll post my thoughts on GitHub.
@_date: 2014-05-07 04:42:13
Yes, backup the entire phone. Restoring can be a pain, but it is for disaster recovery and shouldn't be an everyday thing. I'm considering email backups as another option.
Coin Pocket was made to be easy to use for new Bitcoin users, so I didn't want to complicate it too much with giving them a UI to their private key or seed. Users don't need to see or think about that stuff.
@_date: 2014-05-31 05:23:30
It is this one: 
There's a link to it from Coin Pocket next to the "Scan Code" button.
You have to use that "Scan Code" app since it is the only one that can interact with other apps.
@_date: 2014-07-11 17:38:45
Yes, it is possible for developers of a wallet to do a malicious update. Even multisig wallets are vulnerable to this. Some of them are lying to you about being "hack proof" or "single point of failure". A single update to the wallet can send your private keys somewhere the next time you try to send Bitcoin.
All the multisig solutions I've seen so far still rely on a single party to provide the wallet software and signature service. They control your private keys even if it is done indirectly through the software they provide.
I'm developing the next version of Coin Pocket and I'm exploring ideas of integrating with  This means I could build a 2/3 multisig wallet that involves 3 separate parties: Coin Pocket, Trusted Coin, and the user's backup. You will still be safe if one of the three parties was acting maliciously.
@_date: 2014-05-24 23:22:58


It should perform smoothly. It does so on an older iPad 2 that I test on. Are you on iOS 7.1.1? Are you jailbroken?


It is not possible to access a live stream of the camera from Safari. I made the native QR code scanner to do this. The experience is pretty seamless once you have the app downloaded, but you're right it would be better if it could all be done in Safari. Maybe iOS 8 will adopt more of the HTML5 features we need to make this happen.


You shouldn't rely on it. In fact, updating iOS to a new version will delete it. Keep a copy of your BIP38 private key and password somewhere safe! It is required that you do this, I hope it is obvious.


It is possible, but I have it disabled. Web clips (home screen apps without Safari interface elements) have their own data. You could have 10 web clips of Coin Pocket and therefore 10 different addresses. This is neat, but this causes a problem with the QR code scanner. If you tried to use the QR code scanner from a web clip, it'll scan into Safari instead of the web clip. This was really confusing so I disabled it.

The private key is encrypted with your password and stored on the device only. This security comes with the tradeoff that you must manage your own backup of the private key and remember your password.

I'm the Coin Pocket developer.
I haven't been able to reproduce the problem so I can't verify its legitimacy, but I am working on it.
Things you can do:
* Check the amount being sent before entering your password. The amount being sent includes the mining fee, so if it is much higher than you expected. STOP. Don't enter your password.
* If the mining fee is wrong, then send me a tweet  or an email  (email link at the bottom) with your Coin Pocket address.
* Developers can find the relevant code in  I'm guessing the calculation somewhere can become NaN causing the change output to be skipped. I haven't been able to make that happen through the UI.
* Make a BIP38 backup and remember your password. This has nothing to do with this bug, but use this as a friendly reminder. I get contacted every other day by people who I can't help because they forgot their password or lost their phones.

What features would you like to see in an iOS wallet?
@_date: 2014-05-07 13:58:27
Yes, but it wouldn't be easy.
@_date: 2014-05-07 14:01:57
Yes it gets backed up to iCloud / iTunes.
No it does not live through iOS updates. I've gone through 2 iOS updates with Coin Pocket and had to restore from backup. I'm working on another backup option with email.
@_date: 2014-06-03 00:51:46
It is a web wallet. The QR code scanner is in the App Store.
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:22:36
I've noticed this myself. Coin Pocket uses Blockchain.info's socket API to update the transactions automatically, but it doesn't always work. I'll see if there's something I could do, but moving to a more reliable API might be better.
Refreshing the page is a good workaround to this problem.
@_date: 2014-06-14 16:21:27
BIP38 uses the scrypt algorithm which is designed to be slow. It reduces the number of guesses a computer can make at decrypting your private key.
It was slow running in Safari, but even slower when running inside a native iOS app browser. I'm looking into ways of improving the speed.
@_date: 2014-04-28 04:29:44
Not if the transaction has to be verified before being sent. The Chrome extension would have to compromise your email or SMS along with the wallet.
Multisig does add security at the cost of usability.
@_date: 2014-06-16 14:07:23
If you can't wait for the QR code scanning fix then I recommend using the HTML5 version of CoinPocket here: 
@_date: 2014-05-24 15:57:46
I fixed the issue with decrypting some BIP38 private keys. The new version is 1.2.1.
I do the same thing to get a fresh address once in a while. Not sure when I'll get to BIP32, but hopefully soon.
Thanks again for the tips :)
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:44:04
I just got the approval email. It might take a few hours for it to propagate into the App Store.
Viewing private key performance stats:
- iPad 2 v1.0: over an hour. :(
- iPhone 5s v1.0: about 4 minutes.
- iPad 2 v1.1: less than a minute.
- iPhone 5s v1.1: about 15 seconds.
Sending and sweeping also gained a performance boost.
This update also fixes rotation with the QR code scanner, allows sweeping private keys with unconfirmed transactions, and persists storage to keychain.

Not a lot of people know about Coin Pocket. Only 6.5k total unique visits in its lifetime so far. Scan Code only has 500 downloads in its lifetime. A long way to go to get to blockchain.info's 1.6 million wallets.

That was it. The regex is wrong. Thank you for taking the time to look at this. I'll figure out and push a fix soon.

The wallet I developed uses Blockchain.info's API, and this isn't the first time it has gone down. I built in a fallback to helloblock.io's API. There are a lot of other options.
I plan on moving to BitPay's  API to see if it is more reliable. It is open source so you can run it yourself if you don't want to rely on a third party.
@_date: 2014-04-16 22:49:03
Which device/browser are you using?
There's a lot going on in that step. It is generating and encrypting your private key. I've seen it take a minute or two on an iPad 2.

Thank you!
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:45:18
I wouldn't use Google Voice or any cloud based SMS as a second factor for any service. Use your actual cell phone number instead.
If you can access your SMS from multiple places then anyone could potentially access your SMS from anywhere. Likewise, if you can only access your SMS on your cell phone, then an attacker would need physical access to your cell phone to read your SMS.
@_date: 2014-06-25 20:47:12
Sorry about that. This is fixed and is waiting for App Store review. It takes less than a minute to view the private key in the update.
@_date: 2014-06-01 20:49:35
Not nonsense at all  I'm not sure it is on by default so maybe you can make sure it is off if you want to protect yourself from malicious updates.
I haven't thought of disassembling an iOS app. Have you done this for bitWallet? Do they encrypt private keys? Do they store them in keychain? Are they synced to iCloud?
@_date: 2014-04-28 02:40:25
Multisig as a service is a great idea.
I'm skeptical of the multisig wallets that control the wallet code and second signature. They may be secure from getting their data stolen, but not from their wallet code being maliciously changed from underneath them. If they get ahold of your encryption password, they suddenly have two of the three keys.
Separating the wallet service from the multisig service would require an attacker to compromise both independently. The people running these services couldn't steal your Bitcoin even if they wanted to. The three keys are truly controlled by three separate parties: User, Wallet Service, and Multisig Service.
I'll take a closer look at this and consider integrating it with Coin Pocket.
@_date: 2014-06-21 22:12:40
Minor update. Here's whats new in v1.0.1:
- Fix scanning some QR codes. 
- Enable sending to multi sig addresses. 
- Downgrade SDK for iOS 7.0 users.
@_date: 2014-06-26 22:54:30
You figure out how to verify an App Store binary? I tried removing/changing the signature but can't get them to match. I haven't open sourced for that reason, there's not much benefit to doing so.
I'm using the scrypt library from Tarsnap. Did you find something else or do something custom?
@_date: 2014-06-14 16:24:48
I guess Coinbase decided to include a 0.0002 miner fee when you sent it. CoinPocket defaults to a 0.0001 fee and can increase if you have a lot of inputs.
@_date: 2014-04-17 01:41:40

I looked into that "exploit" since I would love to develop a native iOS wallet, but I'd be concerned with Apple seeing the coop as a workaround for distributing iOS apps to customers. They might be ok with it, but if not then that's a huge problem. If Apple takes it down by revoking the enterprise certificate, the app WILL STOP WORKING. This is according to what happened with GBA4iOS 
@_date: 2014-08-18 06:39:51
This doesn't work because there's a binary in the app bundle changes after Apple signs it. I've tried removing or changing the signature with the codesign tool, but I wasn't able to get it to match a local build.
@_date: 2014-04-29 07:05:57
You're right, a testnet version would help get more people to try it out. I recently found a reliable testnet API. This is in the plans.
I meant testing other platforms on how they backup browser data. I can't provide specific instructions for all devices. If anyone wants to contribute information on how their device handles backups please do so. The best we can do is tell the user to backup their device and to practice restoring from it. I'm expecting user responsibility to follow those directions.
I've used Coin Pocket with multiple browsers for multiple devices for myself and have been in public release for a month. No serious issues... it's ready.
@_date: 2014-06-26 20:32:47
No there's no way to reset the passphrase. I'll make a note of this for the next update.
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:55:51
The same thing can happen to native iOS apps. They update automatically since iOS 7. Even if you turn off auto update, I'm not sure there is much you could do to verify an update was malicious.
@_date: 2014-05-24 19:01:05
I'm not sure why you're getting a grey screen. I do testing on an iPhone 4s. Try refreshing a few times? Clear your website data from settings and try again?
You can close Safari and restart your phone. It'll be there when you go back to it. This works by taking advantage of HTML5 application cache and local storage.
@_date: 2014-04-29 04:00:45
I'm focused on iOS right now because that is what I have and use. I'm looking to the community for help with testing other platforms.

You CANNOT restore Coin Pocket from iCloud to a new device. You can only restore to the same device that the iCloud backup was created from.
You can restore to a new device from an encrypted iTunes backup, or just sweep the funds from your BIP38 backup.
@_date: 2014-04-16 22:45:55
Thanks for the tip and the ideas.
I agree, a multi address wallet would be better for privacy. Definitely for a future version.
I didn't think about using paper wallets for that. I usually send Bitcoin to newcomers from my wallet after getting them setup. I do think sweeping private keys is still useful for moving off paper wallets.

Here's a tip: If you run `rake server:prod`, this'll package up an optimized version of Coin Pocket into the `build` directory. It will also generate a manifest file that specifies the browser to cache everything. This way, Coin Pocket will continue to be accessible even if your take your server down.
@_date: 2014-08-30 16:39:20
You still need a way to provide updates to your users. How will a Chrome App prevent you or an employee from deploying a malicious update?
@_date: 2014-05-09 00:32:41
There is a manifest and it continues to work if the server goes offline. You still need internet to talk to the Bitcoin network through Blockchain.info or helloblock.io
@_date: 2014-06-16 16:32:15
Thanks for trying it out. One confirmation is enough.
I might update it to allow sweeping zero confirmations. You won't be able to spend it anyways until the sweep transaction gets confirmed.

Backups are made by backing up your device. Make sure you test your backup and see if you can actually restore from it.
I'm thinking of ways to make backups safe and easy: 
@_date: 2014-05-04 15:54:10
I developed an HTML5 wallet that I use on an iPhone: 
No jailbreak or weird workarounds. It's easy to setup and it uses a real QR code scanner.
@_date: 2014-07-26 19:46:58
It's not completely true. Coin Pocket stores the encrypted private key in the "device only" keychain.
The "device only" keychain is backed up with either an encrypted iTunes backup or an iCloud backup. The iCloud backup can only be restored to the device that it was created with.
Since OP's device was smashed, it can't be restored from an iCloud backup. It can be restored from an encrypted iTunes backup or the BIP38 backup.
@_date: 2014-07-26 19:50:55
The only way you can recover from a smashed device is by restoring from an encrypted iTunes backup or from BIP38.
I don't know how badly your device was smashed, but it might be possible to get it fixed. It might be worth taking it to the Apple store to see what they can do.
EDIT: **You CANNOT restore Coin Pocket from iCloud to a new device**. You can only restore to the same device that the iCloud backup was created from. Only encrypted iTunes backups can be restored to new devices, or you can sweep your BIP38 private key into a new wallet.
@_date: 2014-04-17 17:12:29
Awesome, I'll take a look at issues.
@_date: 2014-06-14 04:00:53
I can open source it. Most of it is already open source  The iOS app is just a wrapper around the HTML5 app.
I'm not sure how you would be able to verify the binary that you get from the App Store. I'll investigate this.
