Forest Gump -- Trump got 1 million dollars to start  buying Real Estate from his dad when he graduated from college. When his dad died , Trump got the money and real estate in NY is very expensive.  With money anything is possible, like he said , every woman wants to hang with someone who has lots of money. His kids are retards. Do you ever read what they say and do?
Most of these subreddits link to Washington Post, NYTimes , Newsweek, The Hill , CNBC , ABC  , all that "fake news" and 
fuck those who say its not real news. Trump is idiot incarnate
You dumb shits think he is hot shit. My god you dopes, just like he is.  Its a conspiracy, the News Media and everyone is against Trump, except for Fox news. You fucking retards

Its stupid to cash out as a US citizen in the USA, you can legally go to an offshore bank and cash out there, pay your taxes there, then keep most of it there. What you bring back is taxable, but you don't need to spend it all here.
