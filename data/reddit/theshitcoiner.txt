Bitcoin is NOT anonymous. Your bitcoin purchases will be traced back to you. Those cash purchases come with risk. You need money transmitting license or whatever it's called. You could get robbed by whoever's claiming to be a seller. Just be careful and use reputable services. I heard (never used) localbitcoins.com is a good start.

Yes, you'll have to verify your identity (ssn, address, and photo id). Everything US based will have to do KYC (know your customer).

CashApp is an app you can use to buy bitcoin. There's also coinbase.com (ppl here hate it) and Gemini.com. Those all are regulated reputable US based services. Idk about their age requirements tho.
Or you can have an 18+ family member or friend buy it for u then transfer it over. I dont recommend going this route but it's there as a last resort.

First thing first, bitcoin is a risky investment and you might lose your shirt and mind in the process. You shouldn't be touching it if you can't handle volatility. 
Second, dont look at dollar value instead start looking at percentages. You lost like 0.01%. 
Make realistic goals and stick to it. You won't get rich overnight. Price will go and it will come down. Dont chase it. Sit back and enjoy the ride.
Also, welcome aboard!
