The absolute STATE of emotional investors
If these people can't see that BTC is killing crypto they're not worth saving. it can't handle the amount of transactions required, it needs to be replaced. no one is going to use it as a store of value, the only thing going for it is its name

tether t&amp;c state tether isnt obligated to give any money for tether

you dont know how tether works. also, that just reinforces my point that they're minting tether without any backing. why are they printing tether if they cant prove it's even backed by fiat?


doesn't matter if you can't sell your tether for USD. Greatest scam of all time - print infinite tether, never prove it's backed by fiat, and never buy it back
