It won’t be an instant free transfer like you can do from your GDAX to your Coinbase, but you can send from your account to her BTC address.  Unfortunately, there will be the network fee, and transaction time which may vary based on memepool.  So better to send when memepool is low.

It will take 18 months until the channel is ready to receive that transaction in the opposite direction.  However, that doesn’t mean there are willing partners in this eagerly awaited transaction.

What’s causing Coinbase to lose Bitcoin customers is Bitcoin user experience.  High fees.  Slow transaction confirmations.  Segwit only marginally helps with those issues.

That won’t last long.  But you can save this Meme.  If you’re lucky, you can use it again in the future if it bounces around at this level a little bit.  Not counting on it staying there.

As production costs go up, miners will move to mine what’s most profitable, which likely would not be BTC at that point, and this would drive price lower as well since lost hash rate will cause slower transaction processing, then those with weak hands will end up selling.  I don’t think the $5K range is unrealistic, but it could also stay much higher.  No way to predict right now with so many variables including dumb money being thrown in without caution.

You have all discovered one of the problems with Bitcoin segwit first hand.  Confirmations can take days or longer, especially if you use a lower transaction fee option.  Fees are high too.  There are other coins that are much better in this respect.  I have my favorites, but I’m not shilling for any in particular.  I would just wait it out, that’s about all you can do.

True.  With usage and onboarding of institutional money over time, eventual ETF approval, etc., hopefully that will stabilize.  Merchants can hedge their bets by moving their daily take to a stablecoin in bear markets, and hold the BTC during bull markets.

Buy and replace is key.  Unfortunately, if transactions are slow, and if fees fluctuate, it makes it less user friendly for this.  For continued adoption and increased actual usage, it must be consistently fast with low fees.

If you do it right, buying on Coinbase is free.  If you link a checking account to Coinbase, there is no fee to transfer money in.  Then you transfer that money to Coinbase Pro (free).  Then you buy with a limit order (no fees).  The withdrawal is free.  There you have it, buying BTC (or any of their listed coins) free on Coinbase.

Judging by the weekly chart, we are still in a downtrend, and we have broken through support lines on the daily chart to suggest (to me at least) that there is a high chance to see a lower low for the year (below $5777).  This would make for good entry opportunities.  The news weathervane is always subject to swing things one way or the other.  Strange that  the good news has seen little effect on price, and bad news seems to be dominating.  Ultimately this will all change when ETF approval happens, which I think will be early 2019.  Who knows how it will actually play out though.

You’re right, if the merchants will accept that.  But I think most would want to see the BTC hit their account, or they’re taking on risk.  BTC is suppose to be trustless.  Lightning is still growing and maturing, and there are fees to open and close channels.  We’ll see as things continue to develop.

Why no hate on Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, and there was actually “support” for Bitcoin SV during the recent BCH fork.  If you ask me, BTC and BCH are different enough at this point, no one should care.  Each project can do their own thing, and move forward with their vision.  Hard forks and competition make the market stronger in the long run, as the market always decides what’s best.  If that’s BTC, then fine.  If it’s something else at some point in the future, that should be fine too.  Anyone who doesn’t want the space to evolve, build and become better is in it for the wrong reason.
@_date: 2019-03-16 13:44:31
Evolution has many failures before it has one success.  Plus, anyone who had BTC got the other forks, and could sell for more BTC, hold or do whatever they want.  I don’t see a problem with that.  The market decides, including those holding positions, miners, developers, the whole ecosystem.

There are already different ongoing experiments being implemented on scaling, including Lightning and increased block size.  The best scaling option for usability and adoption will become more widespread as these projects continue to mature over time.  No matter which option anyone supports, I think the next year or 2 will begin to have the answer for us.  I have my own opinions on that matter, but there are staunch supporters on both sides.  Those who want 1mb blocks base this on a decentralization argument for running full nodes, and it’s hard to make an argument so passionately for so long, and then say never mind, let’s increase block size.  We need to let the experiments play out.  Those who favor bigger blocks point to transaction capacity and speed, low fees and ability to use for micro transactions.  There’s really no need to increase block size when another coin has already done that.  That experiment will play out too.  The best scaling option will become apparent soon enough, whatever that may be, including possibly new scaling option ideas that could be developed.

Here’s a link with a review of the top 3.  Ledger Nano S sold over a million in 2017, and at times could not keep production up with demand.  Trezor has not officially released their sales numbers, likely because they have fallen 2nd to Ledger Nano S in total sales.  Both are good wallets, but more people go with Ledger Nano S since it’s a bit cheaper.

Lots of assumptions here, which I don’t think will pan out.  You are assuming BTC will remain king at  market cap forever, and that every other coin is a security (which won’t be the case).  Anything listed on Coinbase won’t be deemed a security.  That’s why they chose to support them. Ultimately, there will be many different trading pairs on various exchanges, and atomic swaps, making the need to enter the market through BTC unnecessary.  People will find the cheapest way to enter the market they can to buy the coins they want.  A fee based market is counter to that, where people will bypass higher fee options.

If you hold over a year, then sell for a gain, it is taxed as long term capital gains, which is a lower rate.  Less than a year it is short term capital gains, and a higher rate.  I think the exact rate depends on tax bracket.

@_date: 2019-01-07 12:02:15
You could name your device Virus Porn if it were discoverable.  But seriously, you can turn off the Bluetooth when not using it to sign a transaction so it wouldn’t be discoverable unless you needed it turned on.  I also saw that it will only be discoverable if the Ledger Live mobile App is installed.  So not just anyone will see it.  $5 wrench attacks are a real threat though, so best to only use a device in public with small amounts associated.  And only have the App installed you intend to use.

@_date: 2019-01-12 23:36:35
All coins live on the blockchain.  A web or mobile wallet can access them, but if it gets hacked, you can lose your coins.  A hardware wallet also accesses your coins on the blockchain, but the private key is stored on the device and you must physically press buttons on the device to confirm transactions.  So unless someone has your device and pin, coins on a hardware wallet should be safe.  The only exception is with all wallets (web, mobile, desktop, hardware) if someone gets access to your seed words, they can restore a new wallet with your private key, and steal coins.  That’s why you need to keep the secret seed very safe at all times.

@_date: 2019-01-07 04:21:18
I agree that adding more features including Bluetooth could introduce new attack vectors.  What this could possibly allow is also keeping some smaller quantities for spending in cold storage instead of on a mobile wallet while you are out and about.  This would make it convenient enough to spend, with the added step of pressing the Ledger button to confirm the transaction, but with better security.  You could connect to your phone as a WIFI hotspot avoiding use of public WIFI.  Like I already mentioned, I also would hope there is an option to turn the Bluetooth on and off.

Not entirely accurate for USA.  If you sell for fiat, it is indeed a taxable event.  If you trade one crypto for another cryptocurrency, it is also a taxable event per the new 2018 tax laws, with the USD equivalents as the tax basis.  If you simply buy and hold, you are not taxed until you sell or trade.

Start adding your favorite Altcoins underneath.  Of course, find a tattoo artist that accepts digital currency.

Ledger Nano S or Trezor.  Order one, and secure your coins when you can if you don’t currently have one.

No one knows if it will happen or not.  There is a lot of speculation at this point and there are arguments for why it could or could not happen.  A good video was posted in this sub recently highlighting the issues surrounding the ETF.

No, I don’t think Paypal is receiving any crypto.  Only USD at this point in time.  Perhaps that could change in the future if they want to be  be part of the solution, but I suspect that will take some time as they are still in deep with the traditional banking system.

All of these answers demonstrate a misunderstanding of storage.  Your Bitcoins are stored on the blockchain.  Your wallets only access the blockchain.  You need to store your private keys safely.
To say a centralized entity like Coinbase, custodial accounts, the government, banks, etc should store your Coins or your wallet also misses the point of cryptocurrency.  Why trust those entities?  Be your own bank.  Crypto is trustless. And the safest wallet to secure your funds is with a hardware wallet, like the Ledger Nano S.
In the future, people may carry around hardware wallets with smaller amounts on them, like you might currently do in a physical cash wallet.  Other hardware wallets, stored securely, would be like their bank.  You could also use mobile wallets for those small amounts to carry as well, which would be more convenient, but less secure.
I’m sure innovations will happen that will sort out all of the future storage needs.
Edit, just saw this: 
I guess I was on the right track.

You can store your hardware wallet wherever you want, but why trust the bank?  Anyway, it’s not the physical hardware wallet that matters.  It’s the seed words and the pin to the hardware wallet that are more important.  Those are the key to the funds.  That’s what you need to secure.

Hope she didn’t get any keys.  For single guys (or gals), love and crypto don’t mix, it’s like church and state.  Avoid the crypto-digger.

Yes, of course.  That’s why you do something like this:

This website says there are over 35K unconfirmed transactions with 0-2 Sat/byte fee.  So far I don’t see anyone on this string saying they used a 1 Sat/byte fee and it cleared.  When the mempool is full, I don’t think they will clear.
@_date: 2019-05-25 23:47:53
True, that’s why it’s important the mempool doesn’t get full, or else fees go way up as people bid higher to get their transaction through.

Since BTC has a limited supply, and future inflation of Fiat currencies is unlimited over time, your answer is infinity/21million.

That’s a valid point, but until you have more widespread adoption, I think lower fees should be encouraged, to promote more adoption.  The block reward trending to zero is a ways off, and hopefully by that time, adoption won’t be an issue.  Also, with more adoption means more miners, who work for block reward and fees, but more competition with more mining pools would also tend to keep fees in check.
