No, this happens once at my bank in person. Then my debit card just needs to be swiped and have the pin entered. The ATM knows nothing about me except for what is in the mag stripe, and it sure as heck isn't holding that much info.

Hackers will steal anything, just to do it. CC numbers are only worth a few cents each, they steal them all the time. By this logic "penis" must be the most important word in the world because they go through the effort of hacking a site just to write that on the page.

Rebounded as in stopped going down for a little bit? 'Cause that's all I see has happened in the past hour. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:54:35
Well it's going to happen regardless of what i say, and then we will see. I don't see a meaningful number of bitcoiners with a hole in their pocket for overstock's product. I definitely don't see anybody deciding to get bitcoin simply because they take it. That's a delusion beyond wishful thinking at this point. 
Like OP said, it's a meaningless inconsequential gesture that doesn't affect anybody. Overstock has actually been doing better before this announcement and will probably continue to do so. It won't cost them much money to implement either. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 06:53:25
It's a move that only works the first time, extremely short sighted to pull it. But then again, I would not put it below anyone at this point in the game. Neither of those things may sound bad to a greedy person. Mining profitability for most of these people does have a cutoff that I cannot see being prolonged. It's something to worry about.

Eventually, the novelty of adding a little icon next to the credit card icons will wear off for the bitcoin community when they realize it doesn't really bring people in more than one for an obscure credit card gets them customers. And then they also realize that most bitcoiners want to hold and only liked the news because they thought it would make their holdings go up, and not because they had an incredible demand to spend their coins in those venues.

Small electronics are likely okay, its not a complete destruction like TV may have you believe. Grid is dead though and will take years to come around. Months for those who are lucky. This kills the bitcoin, at least from a practical standpoint. It can survive that in the sense that a block chain is kept alive somewhere, but its global reach cannot be maintained, and the depression this event causes will make the loss of bitcoin look like a joke. Economies that are orders of magnitude greater will fall.

I like the idea but I'm afraid it won't incentivize anyone to join who wouldn't have done so already. I like the idea of roving mesh nets with cellular phones and the tech is getting better, but we still have to ask for substantial battery usage which would not be worth any reasonable fee structure I can think of, but crypto currency could be used to ensure reciprocity by power users. Same thing with home base station side, if I make back the hundreds I dropped on equipment it will mean its probably too expensive to be useful. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:34:51
I guess that's what I am  saying along with you. It's unnecessary to happen at any normal ATM because of that and people on general are going to view it as unreasonable in this one. It doesn't matter if the trust relationship is completely different. That's a good excuse but still not one I'm going to react positively to.

If you are set in stone on the timing of the retail purchase you could lose money, maybe even enough to not afford the laptop depending on how much room you are leaving yourself. Yes, even lose enough that the discount isn't worth it, the last week has been bearish and that may get worse in 4 days time, hard to say, but my hunch is its unlikely to be that bad. News either way can change things majorly in that timeframe. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 07:01:28
"Good for bitcoin" is a fucking joke of a cliche around here. The vocal majority would agree with you under any circumstance you can imagine. It crashes, good, cheap coins in steady hands.
They would agree aliens destroying humanity was good for bitcoin because its going to go up in value with the aliens that discover it. 100 bazillion space credit market cap here we come!

Block them from doing what?
Not from actually processing blocks, it's public info. 
Block them from redeeming? Very easy to circumvent. Just send it from different miners each time. It would be difficult to tell. 
Build an actual factual preference into the protocol somehow? It's not a simple fix, and the second you do that,  well there goes the impartiality everyone has loved so much.

I would say the average person can "Afford it" in its current state  in that they have enough money to have a bank account to transfer funds. If the average person is lacking anything, it's TIME to use bitcoin, not money. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 06:57:29
This doesn't smell like the desperate  borderline-lies of  their countless other unsuccessful workaround attempts to defy the state were. But coming after them certainly sets the tone. At least it seems they know they have to beg to keep their business and its not a matter of skirting the law selling vouchers for coupons to buy bitcoin from my personal bank account, or some other dumb shit that was eaten up hook line and sinker by the fool traders left. Why was this then? Desperation.

@_date: 2013-11-27 17:02:02
I believe people that are saying that are saying it because they believe that the current buy and sell orders don't accurately represent the total value of an entire currency, especially when an overwhelming majority bought in for a few bucks, and a majority of recent trade is entirely speculation and not the value of the currency as a currency. Divisibility was never an issue with anybody not looking to nitpick. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:46:47
Good, because there won't be any cashing out during a major correction. Let's pretend the options to cash out stay alive during the rush, there won't be many buyers until the floor is hit anyway. If this happens look forward to a complete shitshow of people having no idea what is going on, there will be no trades to formulate a fiat to Btc conversion. The market will be blind during this time. The people who think they will sell at the first sign of trouble are going to get a wake-up call, so I am glad to see somebody being realistic about this.

Let me guess, in your grace period you expect to be locked into the current price, right?  And of course you would be able to walk away from it too since obviously you might not be able to pay and they can't collect funds.  Lol.

@_date: 2013-09-23 04:55:01
The only way they could keep it is keeping it in BTC. Can't cash out, can't really spend it on stuff or the authorities would be alerted. It's not any better than the idea of mailing if to Jrs  friend. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:40:32
A few hours ago my dollar didn't fluctuate 30% in value in a few minutes time. It didn't buy me a cheeseburger last year and a surf and turf today, either. I'll chalk the first one up to giddy investors causing ripples, and say I do see BTC coming to a steady price eventually, but if its at the end of a roller coaster, a lot of businesses are walking away from it long before that happens.
