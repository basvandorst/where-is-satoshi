Have seen more new players from Australia on SwC Poker recently.
They accept players from everywhere, and it's all bitcoin so no risk of funds being locked up.

No, you'll still be able to look at that graph and choose the fee rate in the same way.
The fee rate will be the same it would be for a legacy transaction... but your segwit transaction will be smaller in vbytes so the overall fee paid will be less.

Yep, that's the one.  Looks just as great in person.
They've temporarily moved it across town to the Clackamas Town Center during construction:

Was it acquired through theft, fraud, the use of force or the threat of force?
If you own something that you were able to acquire through voluntary action then yes, I think you deserve it.

Hmm, yeah their website says it's only 5% like the one in Portland.


And if the exchange rates shown on their website are the same as on the machine then it does seem like it would only be about 5%.

Yes, it definitely makes sense to use bitcoin to deposit and withdraw.
Bovada charges a 4.9% fee for depositing with Visa and 6.9% with Mastercard.  On top of that your bank might charge an extra fee for an international transaction.
Even if you want to keep it simple and use Coinbase you can buy bitcoin with only a 1.49% fee.  If you're willing to wait a few days you can transfer money from your bank to your USD wallet on Coinbase first.  Once the ACH clears you'll be able to purchase bitcoin and have it released instantly so that you can minimize the exchange rate fluctuation between purchase and deposit to Bovada.
There's also the benefit of not worrying about giving your card details to their payment processor, or your bank asking what a certain charge was for.
And there's even a greater benefit when using it to withdraw... no fees, lower minimum/higher maximum,and no risk of a check bouncing or taking weeks to clear collections.
The bitcoin guide on the bottom of their website is a decent overview of how to get started.

Nobody goes to that restaurant anymore, it's too crowded.

I created this guide to help poker players set up a wallet for the first time, so it includes a bunch of info that I'm sure everyone here already knows.
As others have said, the only thing you need to do differently is to create your own seed - using whichever method you choose - and then change the derivation path to m/49'/0'/0'
I use that to receive bitcoin and then send from there to another Electrum wallet with bech32 addresses.

Ignition is the largest site available to players in the US.  They accept bitcoin for deposits and will send withdrawals in bitcoin.  The games and your balance are in USD so bitcoin is just used as a way to transfer money.
SwC Poker is a full bitcoin only poker site that accepts all players worldwide.  They only handle bitcoin so your balance and the games are both denominated in bitcoin.  They have a smaller player pool but they spread more game variants than any other poker site.  And being bitcoin only allows them to have the lowest rake.

Agree.  Bitcoin has had a huge impact on online poker, especially in the US market.
Before adopting bitcoin players had to pay a fee to withdraw, then wait weeks or months for a foreign check to arrive, then deposit it in person and hope the teller doesn't ask questions.  On top of that there was a chance the check wasn't even good by the time you got it, or that it would bounce someday later.
Also, successful poker players make good bitcoiners because they understand and can handle the swings of variance.  Losing x% in the short term doesn't affect them as much because they have the ability to zoom out and look at what their expected return is in the long run.

If miners try to do things that users don't approve of, then the users won't follow their version of bitcoin.
If the users don't follow, then that version won't have value.  
If it doesn't have value, then they'll be be wasting money mining it.

You can use NFC instead of QR codes with the [Airbitz wallet](

Must have meant bitcoin because that's one of [Bitcoin NW's]( machines... looks like it's [this one at the mall in Salem, OR](

Interesting coincidence that the shadows and background in this photo match up exactly the same as [this photo]( of an old Luxor billboard shown on the Las Vegas Review Journal website in 2017.
