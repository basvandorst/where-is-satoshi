Remember,  we now miss those 2011 prices of 10-50$ range thinking "i wish i got btc when it was at 10$" ,   
and you will miss these 7k prices as well post 2020-21. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 17:37:39
yes, it is.
Edit : 2 reasons for this
1. They have a better version of miners so they want to sell the stock they have on previous miners.
2. Low demand of miners now compared to what it was last year.

btc not a payment option, I'm not buying. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 11:30:03
This will be a waste of time, nothing else.
Why? 
1. They already know about bitcoin. 
2. They might work on their own token and only accept it as mode of payment.
Though i totally agree with your point - a major player like Amazon comes into this scene, and it will give legitimacy and it will boost confidence among hodlers, newcomers and most importantly it will be MORE MARKETING. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 03:20:19
what if i received my pay in january ? and hodled it for few months \~8 ? and say i need to pay my bills now ? ofc it didnt went up.
There is a downside for time being (long term : it might shoot up and give good returns **might** ). dont just comment bs pls.
edit : i dont believe in this guy paul - but it doesnt mean you only see 1 side of the picture.

10-20% is ALOT, and it's  rare that they do ~10% ++ charge.
and they dont always charge 10-20% ++, they sell for less than market price as well as you can check graph of last few weeks, both ups and down.
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:35:00

I'm situated in USA, got option of using only US banks.. I think we should make a list of banks which allows or don't allow crypto related transfers or services to make it easier for newbies like me. 
But sadly, I'm hardly getting any response on my threads.. :/ 
@_date: 2017-08-28 08:30:09
done. thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:48:36
yes i am entering on my bank's site, I was in the bank actually when i was doing it.. they said either the IBAN is incorrect or basically the problem is not on their (BOA) end.
Edit : the iban validator link you gave, it says the IBAN is valid.. god this is fucked up shit.

I'm a trader and have traded descent amount in crypto in the form of "cash" , I suggest you to sell your coins mostly for cash but a significant amount for bank transfer as well. 
Pay the tax on bank transfer &amp; the cash you can invest that part into the business that you want to do, I suggest be in crypto and start looking for partners who can help you to deal in cash in countries like China, India, Thailand, Singapore etc. 
This way you will have funds to spend (bank transfer lot) and the remaining funds in cash to do business in cash itself. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:56:09
I use that exchange, i know they most of the time charge few %% ++ but i am simply saying that it's not always ++ ratio. and the 10% amount is rare, 20% is v v rare.
Also, they did sold btc at a lesser price than global prices for ~10-15 days, this was in the july or the same month. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 10:23:52
It's sucks for new users like me, more like a bad experience to get into crypto.

man trust me, i have tried with 4 banks till now.. all of them said no to btc related transfers.. 
I really want to be into crypto market... but sadly i am not getting any positive feedback from anyone... 
Searched online for hours to find a single bank in USA which can do the transfer but all failed :| ... can you PLEASE look into your system or ask someone you know who is a US citizen or uses a US bank account.. ? 
it'll REALLY help me man..
Thanks alot.

you clearly have no idea, how much crypto was in demand OTC trades in india (forget about the trades done on exchanges which was ~7-9k btc per day) ofc after the uncertainity about whether crypto will be legal or not - and imagine once it is legalised. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:00:32
Exactly, same people will again talk "i wish i bought it when it dropped to 6k lvls", when it (and it will) break previous ATH, it's just a matter of time -  regulation, mainstream adoption which is happening and i think the bull run which we will see now will break all the records previous bull run set earlier. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:20:03
if not satoshi or a human itself, who do you think created btc ? your cat ?

Which bank do you use for transfers related to coinbase ? 
@_date: 2018-06-23 06:53:27
nah i sold already at much higher lvl's and i was expecting this dip. 
ofc i will go all in again at \~5.3-5.5k lvls. and hodl.
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:35:01
It doesnt make the price at 30% . Cuz just because few 10-50 people buy 100-200$ worth btc at 30% while rest of the buyers and sellers doing it at almost 1:1 global rates doesnt make the price at 30% + premium rate. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:03:56
ofc sure, i am also gonna go all in - i am expecting \~5-5.2k which might happen and if not i will just buy and i will be all in no matter if btc goes to 1k. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:50:39
trust me on this, if Crypto is allowed in india this will put a good green in this market. 
Being an indian, i know how much money goes into crypto OTC when trading (fiat to crypto) was not banned

true !
@_date: 2016-12-06 13:08:44


Yes, btc is new to me &amp; my business (which is real estate). 3k is experiment money which i'll try for next ~1-2 months and see how it goes from there. If it's good i'll invest in this market as well.
Tax is not an issue for me, My firm is legally registed pvt ltd firm. 
Thanks, but can you please explain what's Arbitrage. 
Thanks again!

I am an India, and i totally agree with the statements of govt officials that BTC ease money laundering (which was being done in our country but it makes it easier to do), secondly the issue of black money.
they is nothing to be sad about it, give the govt time - our govt is PRO blockchain, anti crypto.
why anti btc ? 1.) it cannot be tracked thus boosting the MONEY LAUNDERING.
2.) The issue of black money, it's storage is very easy with btc. 
it's not a FUD, these are the facts.
If you know any local OTC trader who deals in cash, just ask him and he will explain it to you. 
I am not in support of our govt banning crypto's but i do want them to regulate it - and lift the ban like china will do (hopefully).

@_date: 2018-06-29 11:33:21
I am an indian, and i do buying and selling.
And let me assure you just because someone asks 30% premium doesnt mean that is the going rate.
I am buying  rs which is almost 1:1 with the market and bought 8 coins to sell today at hardly 1-2% profit margins. 
So, once again - just cuz some dumb people ask for 30% doesnt mean its the going rate.
And people commenting on this post - pls confirm the content first, NO ONE IN INDIA IS BUYING AT 30% (well maybr few dumb people 10-20-50 at max). 
Zebpay, koinex are few exchanges where you can follow for prices or lbtc for otc deals amd i assure you this post is fake as fuck or op got a btc trader who is an idiot. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:02:44
people do say, i got in when btc was 10$ - 20$ etc, and i sold at 100-200-500 etc - but when btc went to 19k Lvl's last year, they were like we wish we had hodled for 4-5 years, i would be a millionaire and shit.
People Please, Buy now - hodl - forget for some time period let the market settle, and get mainstream adotpion and you wont regret it, Crypto is here to stay.

i suggest, go into bch when you feel it's low enough to rebuy and do not forget Ethereum and litecoin.
i dont think so that this shit show is over, i am sure bch will surge back later on, though the safe coins acc to me are Ethereum and LTC probably.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:20:21

Am i broke? Depends if btc goes down or crashes.
Do i have enough if crypto crashes ? Yes.

1. Moving millions of $$ of property.
 Yes, so? 
2. Unemployed? Lol, looks like you need to read what i wrote above "i'm all in on cryptp" and i am in loss rn  rates, so if i look for alternatives besides crypto, whats wrong in it ? 
Dont be jealous 
3. Yes, i am a gamer and trading &amp; making profits out of it keeps me attached to gaming.
Whats wrong if i make extra money by selling game items? 
Not sure whats your problem, but you need to see a doctor.

i am 25, living in India. I'm good with what i made tbh, but ofc i won't be leaving crypto anytime soon, already invested into Alt's 70% of what i made by selling btc, rest for mining purpose. 
there is always such thing as "enough" even for you it's just you don't want to accept it, i am pretty sure you are not talking in Billions here, we are talking few millions or couple of 6 digit figure.

coinbase is not doing anything with bcc or anything new in times like these, so for me it should be just another normal day for them.
Also i get the part &gt;why would one be tempted to risk anything at this juncture?
Because one needs coins that's why.. lol
