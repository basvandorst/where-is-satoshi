You make a point, but what about new ones? I'm sure there are people studying and looking to get into bitcoin and related technologies developments. They will probably need some bounties or even mensal regular incomes to pay their bills short term. They can't wait for long term to benefit from bitcoin. Lightning dev people are struggling to get some competent new devs. Could it be the lack of incentive that is making this process so slow? I don't know the answers I'm just raising some questions.

"Cashing out" will be "using bitcoin to buy stuff anywhere". Early adopters will be the ones to benefit the most, but later people will benefit from the safety of their money and liberty to do whatever they want it, when they want it.

You seem lost. Bitcoin is still in beta mode. Satoshi himself didn't want the project to get any attention in the beginning because the project was still a "nerd" thing and the less noise would mean more productive work. If you advertised without knowing what you were doing or warning people this is a work in progress project, it's only your fault.
However, 9 years past and the censorship resistance of bitcoin is now rock solid proven IMO. Great upgrades have been made, upgrades and exciting solutions are being coded and you are disappointed for what? It looks like you got caught by the FUD, unfortunately, because this is just the beginning boy. If you want to become part of something big in this world, this is your time, the technology is here and is being improved day by day.

A miner might include some small transactions in a block just to fill up the remaining space.
So this means nothing unless there were a great percentage of low fee transactions included in a block.

They can't even implement properly what they advertise it's simpler, see Xthin blocks and flex trans. They are a joke to the community. Their roadmap is essentially bitmain protective.

Complaints are always louder than compliments. You don't often see 99% of people creating threads to tell that a service is good and recommending them, but if 1% is having issues... you can be sure they will be louder than the 99% of people not having problems.
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:22:29
Testnet also looked very centralized in the beggining. We can't actually assume anything (for now) from mainnet for the following reasons:
- Too early
- We are still in the stage that releases might not be backwards compatible, so I believe 99% of mainnet people are really technical brave People/Business carrying the front line risk
- It's too technical to an average user start using a LN node or solution right now, I believe many newbies will still run to *REALLY* centralized services like coinbase, xapo, etc anyways, until they learn the hard lesson unfortunately :/
In fact there'll be some huge nodes in the game, this is inevitable as much as centralized services are still a thing even in crypto space (look at coinbase, it doesn't even make sense how much people rely their coins on them). However, don't forget LN relies on bitcoin, even if a highly connected node shuts down, the network will resolve itself in no time and people will get their money back. So I wouldn't worry at this too early stage metrics because it doesn't say much right now, as more peers join the network the risk of failing payments after x nodes removed will decrease to oblivion.

You can't. Eclair haven't implemented incoming transactions yet. It's only for payments for now. There's some issues to solve incoming payments for mobile.

Nah, you're too passionate here. There's no place for passion here, there's logic. The paper is a historic document and I respect that, but it's really important to make this distinction between an important document of the past and the current status, a paper from 10 years *might not* make sense to a current problem and its issues. In fact, papers are published referencing older ones in order to point its issues and improve them and that's **exactly** what Satoshi did, see his references. Science goes on.
Resuming, as everything in this world, satoshi and his paper couldn't predict other attack vectors to come. The scenario we have seen in the past years is not the same he envisioned, he even made some adjustments right from the start, and as he were probably a logic man and a scientist, he was plainly open to modifications and adjustments along the way which he actually did.

* Once you set up your wallet, go to a faucet and get you testnet bitcoins [here](  (yay!!) 
* Once you have your tBtc you can open a channel (wait for confirmation) with anyone on the network, you can browse some LN nodes [here]( if you don't know any.
* Now you can have some fun and try buying some blockcoffees at [Starblocks here](

All cryptos are crippled by default. None them have solved the scaling problem. If they did, you can be sure bitcoin would be obsolete as of now.
The point is that cryptos can't scale massively on chain without hurting massively the descentralization, it's being proven before and it's being proven live, check the recent kitten game in ethereum, one game and their blockchain is clogged!

The protocol **might** be complex (for you, because for me is very easy to understand it and contribute to it), but the GUIs aren't complex.
For bitcoin base layer, you don't see average joes messing around with hashes, pift paft, create private keys, BIPs, HD wallets my ass. Most of them just heard of some seed words and that already bugs their minds. Or even worse they don't even know about it and leave their coins on coinbase or any other third party service.
Same with LN, they don't need to know how it works or if it's complex, this is just an excuse for lazy developers/people. The interfaces that are being made are very simple, even for this early stage, and straight forward for them to use once stable.

It helps because more real people using will lead to unknown bugs and this creates issues to be solved and so on
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:23:03
LN needs at least one transaction onchain. Also, LN is mostly great for small-ish payments, so they will be limited to low limits, therefore at one point there'll be a balance between using LN and transacting on chain

I don't think raising the block size a bit is a bad thing, we just need a proper code and timeline to do so. I hope when the times come to do it we can also take advantage of other updates and make a good update bundle for good.

LN is a permissionless feature, so there are some teams working on it:
You can find some info here: 
A beta product implementation here: 
And another LN implementation here: 
Although once the protocol implementation is stable it is very likely (correct if I'm wrong) that'll be integrated into Core client.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:55:41
LN is too cheap and keep the blocks fairly small. I guess Roger doesn't like both at the same time
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:01:33


Yes, besides the price hype there are tons of development going on to make bitcoin faster, scalable and more efficient. As this sub gets more and more new people from the hype, it seems there's only speculation. Unfortunately there's no way to control these low quality posts when something is going parabolic, if it's not this sub it'll be elsewhere where most of these people will go visit, but at least they can get some overall info here
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:54:47
Same arguments for mBTC, 16,950 gives much more sound value than 16.95. When 1 satoshi is worth $0,01 we won't need to worry about valuations and bla bla bla, bitcoin will be king at that point

There's no reason, they should show it too. Tell them about it and give them some feedback :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:30:13
I guess there's a lesson to be learned. This is a new technology and shifting from banks taking care of your money to secure your life savings by your own will not be an easy task for normies for some time. I agree with that.
Hardware wallets might be what suits the most in terms of security. People should consider HW Wallets as vaults for their life savings, but they still need to get educated on how to use it. I think in the future there'll be more user friendly and long term storage solutions for these people as these concerns will grow bigger over time.

@_date: 2017-12-10 02:06:36
You can't. Eclair haven't implemented incoming transactions yet. It's only for payments for now. There's some issues to solve incoming payments for mobile.
The desktops clients/wallets cover this, so if you really want to test receiving payments you can download one of them and play around with it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:23:06
Segwit? Roger and his miner friend made it delay for almost a year, so instead of the "no effort was made to scale on chain" I guess there was a pretty good effort for butthurt miners to look like only increasing one variable was the answer to all of it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:51:22
We all have scaling plans, bitcoin also has, in fact, [lightning is around the corner]( and many other improvements are being developed while we talk here.
Ethereum is also looking for payment channels and other solutions as I have seen
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:54:32
Do you have any seed or private key? You could just recover and move ASAP to a wallet you can control
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:00:38


And none of them are addressing the issue correctly. They are just ignoring the problem and taking advantage of a temporary propaganda.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:42:17


You may be also looking for more than one seed words in one of your written words, for example
 might be hint for the words 'row' and 'some' or even 'throw'

I'm trying combinations now... it takes a while :/
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:49:54


You could, but exposing a private key to thousands of people will probably cause a race to pay higher fees even in BCH, with 150kb blocks and low transaction volume, in order to get confirmed ASAP

@_date: 2017-12-06 21:22:04
the coordinator is one of the central problems, it doesn't offer much different other than the attempt of a half baked solution, but it does not mean it can't fulfill some use cases.

There's no way to tell "who represents the Bitcoin Core Devs". Anyone can contribute to any part/version/feature/etc of bitcoin. The best you can get for "current work" is the [0.16.0 milestone release version](
) and other capacity enhancements such as MAST, Schnorr signatures, Lightning Network. They are all mostly being developed in other repositories (as it should be) by different groups. I want to give you better links but and can't get them easily now.

Have you read the wheel white paper invention sir? I guess modern cars are not the true wheel inventor's original vision, so what's the plan? get back to pre-historic years? 
"A true wheel is a wheel alone. If you want to scale a wheel you should make more 7 wheels, to make it 8 wheels. That'll solve the problem of wheel under performance, so you can carry more stuff on these wheels. When 8 wheels limits has reached you can scale to 1000 loose wheels"
Sorry, but science and evolution has never been and will never get stuck in one paper alone.
Good luck and welcome to evolution.

Single effort? NYA was thing to miners save some face. Everyone (miners, community, devs and companies) was excited about segwit fix before Roger and Jihan started their shitshow this year. Segwit delivers both on chain capabilities, enhancements and enables permissionless off chain solutions.

@_date: 2017-12-04 01:56:29


No, however the first person knows one of your address. So if you make a transaction spending your btc from address 1 and address 2, they can assume they were originated from the same owner, therefore chain analysis is a thing on bitcoin :/
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:27:49
[Not your keys, not your bitcoin](
Bitcoin is about not trusting a third party or centralized services. Government can seize/stop/close coinbase for whatever reason any day in the future. Coinbase can be hacked in a massively way that can't be solvent anymore and the goverment will not cover the losses

You do bring some points here, but segwit more than doubles capacity for now, without LN or other improvements to come. I believe until Q1 2018 end we'll see a significant segwit adoption with the help of community pressure. 
Besides that, I guess we would need to discuss a better capacity increase without rushing things like B2X did that could have blown up bitcoin with a bugged code

Submit your issue/proposal to bitcoin github or the bitcoin mailing list. 
But first search the block sizes increase proposals that has been attempted in the past (even from some core contributors) and see why they didn't get through. Hint: no consensus.
But, if you really think this is the time, even with segwit being already a block size increase, develop your argument there, prove your points and bring an existing proposal (that could make more sense today) or make a new one. Bitcoin is open source. You can directly contribute to it

The roadmap is the same as before. It's just that it took almost an year of propaganda and attacks trying to delay segwit and here we are. LN is being developed, likely a production release in the next months. MAST just got its proposal done, Schnorr sigs is being worked on, improvements to the main client are being made and so on. It takes very few time googling to know about all of it.

For those eager to use it... it's **AWESOME!** 
You can try out the Lightning network on testnet. It's simple and easy:
* You can download Eclair testnet wallet on Google Play Store [here](
* Once you set up your wallet, go to a faucet and get you testnet bitcoins [here](  (yay!!) 
* Once you have your tBtc you can open a channel (wait for confirmation) with anyone on the network, you can browse some LN nodes [here]( if you don't know any.
* Now you can have some fun and try buying some blockcoffees at [Starblocks here](
Let's learn it, develop it, test it, use it, give feedback, improve it! (or just use it for newbies :D)

Bitmain basically controls that much of the mining supply. Not too long ago someone discovered a backdoor switch on their miners.

For me the value relies on freedom, complete control of my money, "easy to use", no shitty bank limits and setbacks. It's about decentralization, it's a trustless system, no middleman, no fat hands controlling your money. The deflationary factor makes people greed for it, it's not a killer feature for me, but that's how it was designed and it keeps incentive to make a always better currency, it brings innovation. Even if it had somehow a stable price (it'll be when it goes full mainstream) I would buy for the characteristics above, not for the "get rich scheme"

I'm not telling that it'll be killed but people will try to, it's a predicted event that Bitcoin aims to tackle elegantly. Bitcoin has suffered many attacks, this is on of them and it'll probably resist. 
The BCH EDA thing is a problem for both chains, more like suicidal problem for BCH I'd say. Time will tell.
My point is that is kinda scary to see "known people" sort of coordinating attacks and the other sub going okay with it.
@_date: 2017-08-06 23:53:31


It's really misleading people by this level. Unfortunately I've also seen some other people falling into it. Although I see no harm in creating an altcoin out of bitcoin, but the way it's been propagated or claiming the "true bitcoin" is very dangerous and unfair.

@_date: 2017-08-24 15:30:24

@_date: 2017-08-20 13:28:19
Of course it is relevant. He's saying it's better to test a change before trowing into the network simply by hand waving hoping no one loses money in the process, or it ends in centralization or nodes banning each other (happened several times with alternative fork attempts). It's not a matter of liking or not, it's a matter of reliable code and how you make sure people don't lose money.
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:13:23
ok, so ~x150 more?
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:04:31

@_date: 2017-08-15 16:23:03
Yes! Nicely said. People often forget to compliment such performances.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:02:02
Check [Samourai wallet](
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:00:29
A straight block size increase to 2-4MB is actually feasible IMHO, it might hurt the network a bit but it forwards known issues, including spam dust, bandwidth, computational resources, malleability etc. However, some of these concerns got covered by segwit either directly or indirectly by opening new possibilities and enhancements for less, cheaper and more efficiently. 
You know, computer stuff is all about resources, there's no free lunch, you increase here you lose there. It's hard to find a balance and that's why there are so much friction about the block size debate over the years. 
edit: In addition: Business man will never bother about it because they can afford "everything", if they could they would've already raised to 1GB and centralized all the way. Do you want a coin run by business man? Cause we have that already. Why bother having bitcoin after all.
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:32:35
Automation is faster depending on the case. You just need to cross some info and then you have an unique tx or a small subset of txs to work on it. I'm just guessing low. There must be more elaborated tracking algorithms that goes way deeper than this.

LN is not a precedent to have segwit actually. There's some others developments and improvements that can benefit from segwit activation and its features. The block size increase will gain effect as segwit transactions become the norm, which is expected to have a small bump right after the activation
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:27:23
I mostly agree with you.
Segwit is a blocksize increase to about 2mb, which is wonderful and we have 3 months to prove it works as intended plus other following improvements to come.
However, I see this likely scenario: ~90% miners signal for NYA today, so there's a huge pressure for the remaining ~10% to switch for S2x, then it'll end up with 100% hashpower, wouldn't this be called bitcoin? The minority hashpower network will be hell dead, no? Has anyone considered such scenario?
edit: I think what xurebot meant is that if Core devs go for the 2x, you can be sure it'll push to nearly 100% support from all sides.

BCC is highly inflated. Few users are bothering to trade/dump it, almost no ordinary-joe-wallet BCC support and so on. The market cap for BCC is not accurate and misleading because you multiply the price of bitcoin c times the "BTC total circulating supply" which gives the impression that's being valued, but it's not. This price is what few people are willing to pay ou buy ATM. The circulating supply is more like "BCC emitted coins + few old BTC coins that are actually trading".

Nope, this is more like an easy spammable bigger block flaw exposure. Fortunately we'll have solutions for this soon and when bitcoin really needs to increase it safely it will.

This "bunch of devs" contributes to one of the most decentralized coded respositories you can find and yet with an organized, well defined development process, highly reviewed, tested and stable to date :)

@_date: 2017-08-29 23:40:34


You should not. Really. This is how science works, slowly but surely (I actually think it's fast now). Years ago was a pain in the ass to access internet. Most didn't even believe that it could work or scale and here we are now. Many layers were created. Most of those layers remain to this date. Scientists and believers did not stop. They improved. They made enhancements. They made and make trade-offs everyday. Today, you can access internet through unthinkable ways. It scaled enough for a fairly amount of people on earth and it's not done yet, we still have nations with absurdly expensive to no internet!

This particular graph represents unconfirmed transactions. Someone spammed enough transactions to reach 8MB blocks on Aug 16. As you can see most of these transaction have worthless 0 fees, aka free. 
All btc crowd, ver and its sheeps got happy about the spam event, pushed some "hey we do 8x better than btc" propaganda (thousands of centralized altcoins do too), ignoring the real problem and short damaging Bitcoin.

Well, they won't spam forever, just when they need to push a propaganda and spread FUD. They have been successfully proving the spam issue on both BTC and BCH chain. And it's fairly cheap for them as have a high stake and ~50% of fees might go back to a certain miner.
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:51:54
It's all about scaling. All UTXO blockchains face scaling issues. Ethereum faced recently too and will continue to do. I doesn't take too much. 
IOTA might be actually the most disruptive technology among them but it needs more tests, tests and more empirical stress tests. Unknown attack vectors have not been widely explored, so it's all about touching a new ground. 
Bcash for me is just a backup plan as much as litecoin. However if at any point we need a "backup plan" I think who's the better altcoin talk will be the least of our concerns.

@_date: 2017-08-29 15:24:07


I can't. Internet where I live is unfairly capped. But I'm ok to stop running and increasing the blocksize as long as it packs some good trade-offs, not just 4x-ish, 8x-ish.


I haven't spent a single transaction fee over $1, even during these outages. I indeed paid more recently and I don't feel happy about it, but that is all you get for a decentralized currency, there's no free lunch. Fortunately, we have already take a good step with Segwit, there's more to come.

Actually they're not obligated to support n-forks on bitcoin. They warned several times about the upcoming fork and users warned like 100x more and each minute before the fork. 
There's a high risk about trading/selling Bcash and its network is far from secure and still open for attacks(if not already). Can you imagine how chaotic is in so many levels to support an insecure network for a bussines?

LOL? Do you really think you'll know when coinbase will be hacked or bankrupt in time to withdraw your money?


What's the difference between using an user friendly mobile wallet(such as breadwallet) vs coinbase app? These two apps are essentially the same. Use coinbase to buy bitcoin then transfer it to your own wallet. Coinbase even makes you pay even more for transactions, what's the point? What's wrong about people writing down 12 words about their life savings and putting it a locket? Are you gonna wait the next wave of banks bailouts or governments intervention for that? I'm not against coinbase, they have a great service by being a gateway to bitcoin, other than that they're just a regular bank with the same point of failures. 
Furthermore, users can still make mistakes with coinbase e.g: sending bitcoin to a wrong address, using sms 2FA, and tons of other things coinbase can't do anything about it.

Even 10% adoption has proven to lower fees short term, considering all hashpower is on BTC and not milking profits from BCH EDA gaming. Now imagine if the services and miners that are whining about fees actually started using segwit... I'm just saying. It's all FUD for me.

It's not a requirement, but bear the consequences then. Leaving your bitcoins on Coinbase is no different than leaving your money in banks.
There are plenty of light and user friendly wallets you can control as easily as Coinbase mobile app, it's not an excuse today if you do a minimal research on what you're investing. So what we do for these people by telling [Not your keys, not your bitcoin]( is educating/refreshing one of the main reasons why bitcoin was created.

This market share argument is the worst argument ever. Even Ripple took ~23% of the market share this year because of the pump manipulation, even though ripple is... WTF?. Also, Roger, either directly or indirectly, started to pump other cryptos this year, yet he uses it as an argument against "Core". He did the same about Bitcoin cash recently. He knows what FOMO effect can do so he will always take advantage of it. 
At this point, Roger, a self made millionaire, explicitly doesn't care about "bitcoin that, bitcoin this", he DOES care about make more millions out of FOMO people. Those who followed Roger movements especially this year know what I'm talking about.
As a person who got introduced to Bitcoin in 2014-2015 by one of your videos, either alone or being interviewed, I can only say I feel sorry for you. If you really cared about bitcoin, you wouldn't waste so much energy and resources to destroy it and pump other coins you were invested in. I wish you could use all of your energy to actually improve bitcoin and listen to actual code contributors and scientists of the matter, otherwise we could have witnessed the segwit activation right from the start and the community wouldn't have wasted so much time and resources trying to upgrade bitcoin. All this shit show made Bitcoin lose roughly, directly or indirectly, a year of development, holding us back when we could just have used this time for other improvements. 
We (I particularly say me, part of the community and you) may have some or tons of visions in common, but the paths are different now, I stay with bitcoin and you chose to follow Bitcoin cash. I can only ask you to stop calling Bitcoin cash is Bitcoin and try to confuse people by saying it. If you are so convinced about Bitcoin cash, please let it grow by its own technical merits, do not push innocent people in the middle of this, because we both know that most people enter this game for the money, then only a portion do their actual research.

Just to clarify: A node does not receive a batch of transactions all of once, this might just be a batch from an exchange that it took the some time to broadcast and the node to receive, then this is reflected in the graph, or even simpler, it's just some people taking advantage of lower fees to get their txs quickly confirmed.

If you really cared about bitcoin, you wouldn't waste so much energy and resources to destroy it and pump other coins you were invested in. I wish you could use all of your energy to actually improve bitcoin and listen to actual code contributors and scientists of the matter, otherwise we could have witnessed the segwit activation right from the start and the community wouldn't have wasted so much time and resources trying to upgrade bitcoin. All this shit show made Bitcoin lose roughly, directly or indirectly, a year of development, holding us back when we could just have used this time for other improvements. 
We (I particularly say me, part of the community and you) may have some or tons of visions in common, but the paths are different now, I stay with bitcoin and you chose to follow Bitcoin cash. I can only ask you to stop calling Bitcoin cash is Bitcoin and try to confuse people by saying it. If you are so convinced about Bitcoin cash, please let it grow by its own technical merits, do not push innocent people in the middle of this, because we both know that most people enter this game for the money, then only a portion do their actual research.

Yes, but currently bitcoin is under a sophisticated attack. Roughly half of miners are mining a clone of Bitcoin patched with a difficult adjustment hack to make it short term profitable (only for them), that's the only way they can survive, plus there are some CEOs complaining about what they didn't even made any effort to implement to lower fees short term, which is segwit. So there you have. Please be patient, all of this will be expensive and annoying, unfortunately, but it will not take long.

You're either frustrated it's not a android app that can be done in one day or you don't have a clue that all cryptos are in early alpha mode, which means all of them can't even scale to mass adoption.

I have a short theory: WS will not play this game only on futures. They might have been stacking bitcoin for a while. IMHO they are already here, with some real bitcoin stakes. Futures will help them lower the risk.

Why are people so narrow minded like you?
These are claims for small/micro payments realm. LN is not for huge transactions value as they will be executed onchain preferably.


It's quite unlimited for people (maybe not for machine to machine) because you can make tons of payments with a single channel even with the block size cap today, this will get relaxed as the demand for a block size increase comes to a consensus.


LN IS as instant as using the internet to send a message and it's secured by Bitcoin.


Yes, it's very secure for small payments. People accept 0 conf transactions because the risk might be negligible for small payments, however, onchain scaling will **never** be able to handle massive amount of small payments as we'd like to. LN solves that problem

The thread:
1/ For people asking about China update, our contacts say we haven’t seen the worst yet. More below (note: this is all unconfirmed for now)…
2/ The most conservative outcome being that all OTC trading is banned which indirectly kills all miners (can’t sell mined BTC).
3/ The most aggressive outcome is a straight takeover of mining facilities by the State.
4/ Our sources say we’ll see extreme punishment for some crypto execs that invested client funds without their consent
5/ Also hearing reports of a LOT of mining equipment available for sale at STEEP discounts for anyone that wants to own the risk.
6/ Note again, that this is all unconfirmed and should be considered a speculative rumor for now. There's a lot of rumors floating around.

I don't know what you mean but there's no such thing as dynamic transaction fee. Anyone can set their own fee transaction according to their particular priority.

F2Pool is very slow when it comes to updating their stuff. Furthermore, segwit adoption is still low so it's more profitable for miners to avoid low fee transactions as it will push wallets to suggest 10x higher fees (they certainly know the majority fee estimators today are broken)

Overall, it doesn't work the way you say in practice. They can't even take that money out of the banks if they wanted. There's too much out-of-thin-air money in bank systems. Bitcoin will eventually have a massive spike by then.

There'll always be tools to recover your wallet using the repective BIP especification (I think electrum supports many formats).


I think they let you choose your own node if that's the case.
For better or worse, mycelium is still the pick. I also like samourai wallet for some advanced features and I think they will "catch mycelium" anytime soon (if not already), but the overall day to day mobile wallet choice is still mycelium IMHO.
Always remember if you plan to hold large amounts you better get a hardware wallet (ledger nano s, trezor, keepkey, etc). I just use mobile wallets for small amouts.

Block size already increased to ~2mb. What you're talking about is doubling this, so it's not 2mb it's 4mb. 


If it only 4mb\* had consensus after all. How do you evaluate an explicit attempt to disrupt the network without replay protection that btc1 is now explicitly trying to do? A large portion of users don't want this and we have to protect ourselves. There's a difference about a defensive HF (i.e. govs trying to shutdown nodes all over the world by stealing POW - hello china!) and a random disruptive HF. Take monero community as an example.

Yes, there are still so many others, but it's something.
@_date: 2017-09-09 15:44:12


Yes, I don't want PayPal 2.0. I want a **decentralized PayPal 2.0**. If they want to turn bitcoin into a centralized system it's up to hem, but let me tell you that there are already thousands of better and efficient ways to do it in a centralized fashion.
People on rBtc are really swallowing all Ver lies, forgetting they're on a chain primarily controlled by bitmain. I wish them good luck.

Nah. 99.9% of people still use and WANT banks for historic reasons although they get fucked up every year. The non smart majority will learn the hard lesson again anytime soon. Of course, smart money will make huge stacks out of this (including me lol). I'm really, I mean really not worried about a 70% premined coin. I don't disregard the ecosystem though, the technology they have brought up is very promising but their issues have not been addressed correctly

They are desperate. They can't fight high quality code from the main bitcoin repo. They can't fight consensus. They're not satisfied with BCash. That's why they waste resources and buy every media they can, it's their only tool right now.

Merging changes is ok, the problem is that they want to "Fire Core" using "core code". LOL. What a shame. I'm still surprised how passive this sub are about the signatories of NYA and how they haven't withdrawn this deceptive repo yet.

You will be only in grief if you entered this game hoping to make money quick. Of course I don't like seeing my stack going in half, but you get used after you experience several "crashes" and knowing what you're into
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:24:24
Nope. They didn't signed this agreement nor do I think they would just as many others wouldn't, but if they were involved in this mess they would be included too. So I was specifically talking about NYA CEOs and any other CEO that signed this shady deal

@_date: 2017-09-18 18:50:56
You're taking it too far. I'm not saying they won't, I'm not skeptical, it's just that they can't scale/handle right now, otherwise you would see your grand parents looking to move their funds to bitcoin. There are technical, social and centralization barriers, this is a fact, but it's also true that someone could come up and say "hey I have the solution to scale it all". The potential solution for this could be LN, payment channels, side chains, drive chains, whatever. Anyway, I actually think that we'll see some serious "boom" the next years once some issues are solved, I'm talking about 1-3 years.
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:39:03
IMHO. In your situation I would split into two amounts like 80/20%:
80% I would hodl to death.
20% I would spend it, use it, pay debts, buy stuff, enjoy a normal life as you wish to be. Money may change things a bit for you when you start spending, but I don't think it'll affect too much that much since you managed to live a normal life so far. Anyways, life is too short and unpredictable, plus no one knows if bitcoin will be up in 10-20 years, so you should enjoy your momentum and this unique opportunity at least minimally.
Good luck
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:32:01
If they don't care about it they are not prepared to use bitcoin IMHO so they should continue using their credit card for coffee as always. Why bother using bitcoin anyway? Bitcoin disrupts how money should be used against a debit based economy. You know... bitcoin is even reeducating experts.


I agree but it'll be probably developed and backed by cypherpunks and especialists by then and after that. Just like your internet is improved by especialists, not normies.
What he's trying to convince is that they represent these "normies" and that they don't care at all since they are the ones acting like a bank.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:21:11


They're not leaving, exchanges have to obey their local laws so they can get regulated properly, but the FUD is greater than what's actually happening.
@_date: 2017-09-28 22:08:29
You got it too far. A hard fork can be worked out and still mitigate disruption. Take a look at some ongoing researches on 
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:09:56
\*sigh\*  Welcome to science. How do you think people decades ago started solving the internet scaling issues? Thinking that couldn't have mass acceptance and give up or actually working to improve it and make it usable?

Yes, but it's not YOUR bitcoins essentially. They manage your bitcoin wallet as a service, just like a bank keeps your money. It's a good entry wallet for noobs. But as you learn more about bitcoin you should look for wallets which you can have full control of the keys.

Dude, you're worried about developers leaving but the real flaw and threat is a bitcoin take over by companies. What will avoid them make whatever next agreement and put 1GB blocks in place with only 50 nodes around the world (currently is over one hundred). That IS the flaw, not the competent devs that know what they are doing, it's a coup of companies that don't even know what S2x is exactly about and what they signed up for.

This looks so much more professional. You deploy a soft fork, people start adopting, then deploy a HF cleaning the technical debt after a safe rate of adoption (95-100%?). No one risks losing money, no one has to stop their services. Is there anything discussed about it somewhere? I'd really to like to know.

Exactly this. "We" still use the simplest way of using bitcoin. Multsig wallets or even smart contracs can help these cases. I'd think that as bitcoin hits mainstream adoption these concerns will be more relevant and more user friendly wallets, services and tools will cover this for the normies

I agree about the widespread adoption, bitcoin will get there in time, but today bitcoin and any other cryptocoin faces scalability issues, it's not ready for world adoption and averages joes, otherwise the network would be fucked considering the state of the art blockchain. Devs are working on it to make truly scalable instead kick the can solutions that slows inovativon and harm decentralization.

I don't know about Dash, they sound so scammy to me, maybe they're only on top 10 because their marketing effort, a quick glance there you'll find that in fact it's just more of the same. But if you want my opinion about altcoins: I would look into Ethereum and Monero. They have some really good technical merits that fills their particular use cases fairly well. One year ago I diversified just 1% into them, and it's worth more than 1% today. But keep in mind that solution on top of bitcoin may implement all those features that altcoins aims to tackle, so this could lead to their devaluation. On the long term Bitcoin tends to evolve more organically IMHO.

We shouldn't count by legacy addresses moved to segwit addresses, but by the legacy vs segwit addresses usage on the network, which might achieve 100% (with many transactions) at some point, but I agree with you it'll be very hard to achieve or keep 100%, if ever close to it, due to many factors.

This is a trustless system, we should not rely on them as much as they shouldn't rely on us. But hey, they're are the ones that need us, the users. They can create their coin if they want, no harm on that, but at least make it responsible and show their real incentives to do it.

It's indeed a better metric and it makes more sense than only considering every published transaction a single transaction.

It's all ruled by consensus and the incentives to everyone stay honest in the end. Therefore, attack vectors should always be rejected by honest nodes (full or mining ones), that's the point. The attack vector that concerns me nowadays is the social attack, which misleads people, making some think otherwise and fool them to run/accept whatever rules the attackers supposedly say it's good. We are all constantly in test mode, Bitcoin should be resistant to these attacks, only time will tell if it succeeds or it becomes something else.

Not entirely, but it can be manipulated for sure by ~10% short term profit. There are too many people who buy bitcoin misinformed and panic sell when smart money starts playing. However, you forgot (or don't know about it) that there's a huge market ecosystem involved in Bitcoin already. People can live on bitcoin in some countries, some Govs are trying to regulate it, there are merchants accepting bitcoin, services, startups, investors and the list goes on and on...  In my point of view, it's actually undervalued (on the long term), it's just a matter of when it can scale and handle worldwide adoption.

Where have you been? The rational phase is past. No one wants backroom deals, unprofessional 1 commit per year repository with shady modifications to infect network nodes, and yet they needed a glance from the main bitcoin repo devs to fix their bugs. What kind of arguments do you want for this and CEOs are behind this mess? We HAVE to be vocal about it because CEOs don't give a fuck about rational arguments anymore if you haven't realized yet, and they want to be in control of bitcoin protocol to inject whatever changes that fits their personal business models. Also they didn't even made the proper effort to call experienced developers to this agreement which doesn't even make sense to have "agreements" about individual butthurts CEOs' needs.

I was talking about localbitcoins. Bitsquare(or a better p2p exchange solution) will catch up IMHO. Centralized exchanges will be hacked, censored, shut down, etc, again, again and again. We should not rely on them.


Many of them were using business models that wasn't going to stay on bitcoin in the long run anyway. As well as many business will die when 2nd layer solutions takes off, just like many banks are "dying" to bitcoin (not really, I don't believe they will, just change). Many middleman and third party services will be killed. The truth is that they are feeling threatened about the decentralization and their powerless factor, and for those who feel threatened, they better stay away from bitcoin anyway. That's the way I see and we don't need them. We need each other. It's p2p not p2b

A defensive POW change should do it. IMHO this should be planned more often and considered a natural behavior around here. Monero community always talks about changing it in case an unfair mining domination takes place, such as an ASIC dominant player. Not only this scares a company to waste resources to build an hypothetically ASIC miner for their algorithm, but it also shows how network users have a say on the matter, the longest valid chain it's the chain produced by miners that's validated by the users.

They have trade-offs and ideal for particular cases IMHO. A SPV should be able to alert you if something odd is happening so you can act accordingly and then use your full node for further investigation.
Imagine a bank had a security outage and your bank tells you can't move your money until they figure what's happening and fix the issue. That's the same behavior you should take for bitcoin, but you're the one that control your bank(bitcoin), so the responsibility to sort this out is up to you, you can easily verify by using your full node or any other accordingly action.

You read it right.


You only know if you're running your full node, so you can verify if they're being dishonest by your own set of rules, so dishonest nodes will be spotted out. The worst case scenario would be the one described in the wiki. If say 100% miners go dishonest and change the blocks to 1GB or try to reverse transactions, you'll have your own rule set to validate their moves and reject them as better described here:


This will for sure cause some short term panic, but participants of the network should handle this and act accordingly by changing POW or anything else that comes handy.

What sucks is the current financial system most people depends on. One week of outages is nothing compared to banks bailouts and international crisis that take years to overcome. Bitcoin is greater than this. If you don't fight you'll handle it to companies and the will of some CEOs.

This might work as cold storage if your phone is not compromised. You should also consider a paper wallet.


I only keep on a mobile wallet because I really use it quite often. But if you plan to hold long term and not spend often is another story. It all depends what suits  you and let your funds secure enough :)

@_date: 2017-09-16 18:59:02
I agree with you. I don't think we need another blocksize increase since segwit is deployed now, plus lightning has some challenges to get in production, we may be talking about &gt;6 months for a stable release and wait for the adoption. Segwit delivers a fair blocksize increase until LN is on board, after all those factors are met you can be sure the community will go towards a blocksize increase.

First of all, it's all about UX from now on (kind of, I'm just simplifying here). LN is today as heavily nerd as bitcoin was in the early days.
Anyway, I thought about it too a while ago and I think we may have dedicated device solutions, aka a node with a better UX for the masses, just like a modem, a "google home" that can manage small pocket amounts for the user and they connect their mobile wallets to it. But with the incredibly recent developments the average joe may not even need or know about all of this, so they can just use mobile wallets as they use it today.
We must not forget that LN is an additional feature for bitcoin, not a global solution. There are trade-offs that makes LN better suited for small payments with negligible risks. For larger payments you will want to receive an onchain payment. How will this threshold between a LN or onchain payment be decided? Idk, probably the user itself or the market will converge to a common value.

It's not their intent to let the market decide since they're supporting a forking coin which its intent is to kill Bitcoin and ignore the network as is today. The btc1 repo is very codewise depressing and dangerous, ironically saved by the ones they "want to fire". Still large companies haven't taken any important position regarding this dangerous fork and naively saying (probably not) "we'll let the market decide". Ha! This makes me laugh

They are concerned because Bitcoin eats their lunch. It's like you're saying that although they have $1B they don't care if they lose &gt;20% of it in valuation to Bitcoin. It's like money is slowly slipping from their hands. And they simply don't like it. I wouldn't. You wouldn't. They will probably come into cryptospace when Banks and Govs FOMO kicks in for good. This will take years and lots of FUD from them. I consider it normal, it's the market, bitcoin messes up with people's money directly and indirectly, positively for the majority, negatively for legacy dinosaurs banks CEOS.
In the long run, it doesn't matter if they're afraid or not. Bitcoin goes on.

In this case it's how segwit is a bit codewise more complicated implemented as SF than as if it was implemented as HF. There's essentially no difference between segwit as SF or HF, but the way it's deployed safely in the network, so others don't lose money and some other factors. It's a trade-off you should measure when deploying changes in such big and monetary network.

"No one" will use bizcoin, such as no one will use bcash. They add no value whatsoever being controlled by a handful people


I dont think you read it through. Even if 100% of miners changes the protocol alone the only thing that happens is them following their own chain and the rest of the network will ignore them. That's about 95% of the network that rejects ~150 btc1 nodes. Such movement from bizcoin takeover should be answered by a pow change.

This solution doesn't have any technical merit, that's why it's so contentious. One guy from DCG, his associated companies and one developer are making a highly contentious change to bitcoin and you think that bitcoin users wouldn't do anything? 
I know what you mean by writing this post, but you're a bit lost about the principals of bitcoin that gives it value, no offense, really.
My advise to you is to take your time to read a bit more about what's going on under the hood. We humans were educated for decades/centuries to obey big entities and guess who always ended fucked up. Bitcoin is one of the unique opportunities to make the world a bit better and fairer place, at least a bit.

A lesson that I always take for my life is that you should never expect too much from people. Funny thing, Bitcoin kind of teaches this lesson too by saying "Don't trust, verify". After all, Bitcoin is supposed to be a trustless system.

It started moving up when announcements about segwit signaling begun because the UASF pressure. The UASF thing was much bigger as they have a smaller community.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:23:37
we must wait for segwit BIP141 activation though. but it's for sure closer than never

"BTC base currency" is already a very strong thing in cryptocurrency space. You may see some speculators talking about 0.01BTC, 0.05BTC "sell and buy walls" quite often for altcoins. Only BTC and a bit of ETH are directly associated to USD for availability and obvious reasons.
@_date: 2017-07-10 22:18:00
Nope? BIP148 came before FrankenSegWit8x as an attempt to activate segwit. 
So will you run BIP148 with no test at all? Cause at least they are testing and probably they will fix the issues, that's how software is done. I'm neither supporting S2X nor BIP148. I prefer the status quo because it looks like the spammers ran out of money and bitcoin can move on.

Breadwallet implements what is called an **H**ierarchical **D**eterministic wallet or **HD** wallet, for short. The TLDR answer is: your passphrase is your seed which your private keys derive from. So basically once you know the seed you'll be able to discover all your addresses and private keys to access them. 
The long answer can be found [here](

@_date: 2017-07-20 01:11:39


Technically yes. Segwit brings ~2mb blocksize capacity and Segwit2x aims to double it to ~4mb, hence 2x.
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:41:40
username does not check out
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:04:33
No, this was BIP91 80% threshold which is already activated. The next step is to activate segwit though BIP141, which requires 95% signaling within 2 weeks period, and then 3 months after segwit is activated we'll have the 2x HF
@_date: 2017-07-18 01:05:41
This guy has no idea what he is talking about, that is just fear talking and it's understandable, but doesn't make for a good post.

it's looking better than UASF though. I'm just a bit concerned about how the HF will play out

His pool, Slush and F2pool will signal. Place your buy order. Relax
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:42:38


It'll not make much difference since [they decided to add more seeds instead of replacing]( But I think this is more for the hard fork part, when they need some seeds that'll probably follow the HF part
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:04:21


Start being the OP :)
@_date: 2017-07-20 05:02:38
Litecoin was the unique altcoin that didn't unstuck from $4 for months - they were even frustrated by that, asking why litecoin was not moving while others were being pumped - until UASF and segwit gained traction. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:11:29
they are all independent except for the 2x trigger
@_date: 2017-07-01 03:16:47
I think this is all about the compromise, literally anyone can run any bitcoin code at any point, no one can prevent such scenarios (maybe BIP148 has more scenarios than S2X? IDK), that's why we roughly have consensus every block though. Similar scenario could happen if miners decide to not run the hardfork part after segwit activates.
@_date: 2017-07-31 05:09:57
holy... they don't even know how segwit activates
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:59:08
1 input - 2 outputs is the standard and it's, hopefully still, not possible to get cheaper than estimated low-prio fee by mycelium
edit: What I meant is that mycelium still doesn't offer custom fees or lower fees than estimated, so if you want to set fees by yourself you need to switch to another wallet
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:31:11
They're probably fake signaling to speed things up then really change to bip91/btc1 code.

It's clearly an issue to be solved. I've been advocating that popular wallets and fees estimators are being negligible to this situation by not letting users set fees

Breadwallet does not store your private keys anywhere outside your phone AFAIK. It's not as safe as paper wallet because it's on a phone (if you don't secure your phone minimally you might be infected anytime just like an infected desktop). It's all up to your usage :)
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:29:17
I think it's expected that they take some time to change clients for real. They may be fake signaling to speed things up and and they still have the locked in period to change to the correct clients
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:44:42
Yeah. I hope this scenario produces better estimators that covers this issue. It's clearly less reliable now.

His talks may fool newbies but lacks of technical arguments.

@_date: 2017-07-01 03:03:23
Yeah, it could be, but at 6%(who knows how much sybil ones) enforcing nodes? Still way far from being a thing.
@_date: 2017-07-19 04:21:29
Relax people (but keep your eyes open). They are actually signaling before the deadline which was set to July 21. There are other pools that haven't signaled yet
@_date: 2017-07-19 05:39:19


1mb to 2 mb is not the big issue. Storage is not an issue. Bandwidth, limits and cost are an issue for many countries. The thing is how can we safely HF, or, a better question is: is it worth risking a HF to just increase the block size?
@_date: 2017-07-19 04:49:37
They will signal soon™. [source](
@_date: 2017-07-10 14:16:29


I even advise you to do so
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:35:54
July 21 was the expected day to start signaling. Be patient, they will signal.
@_date: 2017-07-11 00:27:41


You're wrong. The sudden hash rate added to testnet5 recently cannot be easily done on mainnet. But it does have an issue about how the HF part plays out. Take your time to understand they're on test phase (hey, this is why we test), so bugs and issues are expected to happen and expected to be fixed just like any other software in the world. The thing is, when the "stable version" is deployed if there's concerns about the code, companies and users will simply not run it.
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:47:58
all time low would be $-1?
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:56:51
Most users don't even have nodes. Those who have, actually care about such details
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:34:24
Yeah, if it's hard to solve now then popular wallets should let users set the fee themselves as an advanced option at least, because it's clearly not functional given the situation. I have been using around 100sat/b as my priority fees
@_date: 2017-07-19 04:44:37
there's not much volatility at 3 min candle, this is normal for such a short period. Set it to a minimum like 5 or 15min for better visualization.

it's worth mentioning the impressive stable performance of blockcypher though
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:39:35
You're welcome. Make sure you double wrote down on a paper your 12 words passphrase and keep them safe and offline, so you will be able to recover your wallet if you lose or change your phone.

@_date: 2017-07-18 19:52:28


After all, we are a community. if &gt;80% of the hash power are willing to run segwit2x this is something we all should be concerned. BTW the "btc1 group" is being as open as they can to issues and suggestions and not being butthurts, and I think this is refreshing instead of a silly-who-is-the-best-war :)

Similar happened to litecoin. They obviously fake signalized to speed things up then actually switched the software during lock-in period. The problem is BIP91 has a shorter window so they must signal bit1 otherwise they will be orphaned just like dust.
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:20:34
They are independent: [source 1]( 
[source 2](
edit: BIP91 IS NOT Segwit2x. Segwit2x USES BIP91
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:17:57
They are right. It must be really difficult to support all upcoming forks for users at the same time it teaches newbies to control their coins.
@_date: 2017-07-04 17:13:58
unnecessary atm
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:17:19
**Exactly.** Yeah, this litecoin OP is delusional. Maybe he doesn't get this view very often or never did. Bitcoin is just fine, working as intended and resisting all attacks as of now, while others didn't got any closer to such attacks that bitcoin has ever had.
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:24:08
It's everyone's view, even from the forkers. We didn't really need them to tell us.
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:03:58


It's basically this. It's a good wallet, but it seems their design goal is to make things as simple as possible. Because it's a trusted hot wallet "advanced" people over expect from it, but the breadwallet goal is misaligned for this group of users.
So the thing is to find another good wallet that offers slightly the same+advanced need. They could make a spin-off wallet called pizzawallet. So advanced users can customize options and that fit their flavors just like pizza. :) I'm a dev recently getting into crypto stuff. I would find time for it.
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:54:33

Segwit2x activates segwit first. Stop spreading desinformation
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:51:26
I agree with almost everything you said. RBF usage could smooth things out and I'm not all opposed to conservative estimations as for the average joe user this works ok. But as I'm aware of this situation, just as many others, we want to have control over it so I moved my coins to wallets I can control the fee at the cost of way less mobile convenience for me, unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:32:58
It seems miners are working to mitigate this through FIBRE so it should be fine for non-mining segwit nodes. Correct me If I'm worng.
@_date: 2017-07-01 00:46:47
Do you even work for free? If it's even the case of working for "free" you actually have some interest behind that will give you benefits.

@_date: 2017-07-19 16:21:07
Just to clarify: anyone can fork the network at any point. But it's up to the fork community to maintain such fork and user who controls their keys to move their coins in all networks

Man, this is a sad FUD. Can we wait for clarifications and its corrections? The software is not done, they need to test it, this is how is done... wtf.
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:49:51
If segwit activation goes smooth, there's nothing to worry about. But I wouldn't count on it. It's better for you to hold your coins where you can have full control until the storm passes. Even if you choose to leave it on Coinbase, they will surely face a service outage and you won't be able to move your coins or access their services for a while.

BIP91 != btc1
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:05:20
[See "Securing your bitcoins" section](
If you're not techy the most user friendly AFAIK are Breadwallet(the most) and Mycelium(mobile friendly but with some advance options). 
There are other ways to keep your coins safer, like hardware wallets or a desktop wallet with a safe desktop, but you'll probably need some time to get comfortable with it. You can think of it later.
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:56:03
Just out of curiosity, did BIP148 had any test yet?
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:16:54
it's not a "jump" to 8MB for the same reason segwit is not a jump from 1MB to 4MB... he played a little bit with words

I'm still waiting for his troll, he always does,  but in the end he will signal :)
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:13:26


This is unlikely and they will shoot themselves in the head. No exchange will list such an event/coin for trading. They wont be able to sell their forked coins and bitcoin price would plummet. It's really against their incentive to do this.

They are probably counting on previous pools hashrates that are NOW signaling support to S2X. So you will end up with slightly same percentage when all S2X signaling blocks are mined in a full signaling period.

Whatever man. If I can't convince you, who else, right? I believe there's a lot of new people on bitcoin's reddits, newbies and techies, and you should respect them and debate with technical arguments, not hand waving or making conspiratorial assumptions on them. Just saying.

About bitcoin being attacked I don't think there's only bitcoin to worry about nowadays. There's a "crypto decentralization" happening that gives everyone's freedom to chose the most censorship-proof blockchain, which is still bitcoin IMO and technically speaking.

Wow... there was no such thing as computer science decades ago


I don't even know how to read man. I don't know if you're a troll or not (judging by your desperation for a economic page that gives definitions of what a bitcoin should be by standards) but maybe you're blind enough to know why bitcoin was introduced after all. What I tried to tell you was that bitcoin did not come to fit all global standards. It's kinda the other way around. Cheers

Regarding the issue  I don't find it distracting. When I was a newbie, this message was important. Now the message continues to be important for me so I can think if I really want to take risks sending lower fees, so I decided few times to go back and check the mempool (given the current situation *since* february) then go back to mycelium app and finish even though most low-prio confirmed &lt;30min.

Basically in order to contribute to bitcoin/bitcoin repository you have to fork then send a PR with the desired modifications. So that's what a fork **on github** means. Just to clarify

Stick a warning message about how low(or high) the fee is just as you do with "low/high prio" button when setting a manual fee.

The funny part is that most think their money is *safe(r)* in a bank while government prints money and slowly steal people's wealth. 
Really worrying. That's why Satoshi introduced bitcoin after all.

Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies are in "alpha" version ATM. All of them will face issues if massive adoptions comes out or during a peak usage. But Bitcoin and other cryptos can be upgraded and improved to handle such massive capacities, but all upgrades comes at a cost so this will take time. Be patient. 
People value cryptos for what they are worth today and what they are capable of doing today. For example, if you want pseudo cheap transactions you can simply use  your VISA card or your spare bank free wire transfer, so why bother using bitcoin after all, huh?
edit: Keep in mind that you may be paying 50 cents fee temporarily, but your bank is probably eating your money silently and suddenly one year from now you'll be paying $20 what's worth $10 today.

10-12% UASF nodes, which 50% of them (~5%) are enforcing nodes and (nearly?) 0% mining and low economic representation. So basically BIP 148 is not a thing to worry yet. 
Regarding s2x(Segwit2x), well... it's getting traction by the miners and some huge economic players. Some devs don't like s2x but I dont see why some are even supporting BIP148 instead s2x then. Although I don't like the idea of a rushed HF, but it doesn't make sense to support an also rushed BIP148 minority split and the outcomes of it, instead of helping the community to make a decent and somehow coordinated HF through Segwit2x now as it gains momentum.

You know that cryptocurrencies are basically disrupting the burdesome global economy that we know today right? You know that cryptos are disruptive and revolutionary for this matter, right? If Satoshi trusted today's economy she/he wouldn't have started off the bitcoin project after all. Maybe what you're trying to say is the economic incentives of running bitcoin/cryptos. Crypto-economists are the ones you should trust first before Dino-economists.

Same with the fee buttons then. Maybe add this option as an advanced one?
