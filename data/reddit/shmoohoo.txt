Really interesting. Has anyone tried any of this? I'm wondering about the following things (maybe they have this explained somewhere, I'm only thinking out loud here):
* How fast are these calls? In one example they were using on chain transactions. How can the seller of the API be sure that they will actually receive the btc if it's 0-conf?
* I think they are using some kind of payment channels. So is there some initialisation that takes a while (like until the next block) before you can use the API?
* how does error handling work? I pay for an API call but get back an error, e.g. for the address example it can't find that address.
* Especially in the composite example. If anyone can just publish their APIs like that how can you be sure of the availability. The 21 APIs should have high availability but if I start chaining other peoples' APIs and publish this as a composite, and somebody pays me but one of the links in the chain doesn't respond, what happens? Is there some kind of refund mechanism?

How does their 75-25% split work? In their slides, it shows their address is wired in the silicon and the 25% go to a user specified address. But if this is a mining pool and I find a block, I'm not going to get 25% of the block, but the award will be shared with everybody who is mining for 21 right? So 100% has to go to 21 and then they can give me a tiny fraction back, so why do they have that 75-25 split at the silicon level?

Bitcoin developers don't have to be Core or Classic developers. They can contribute code to any fork. If Classic pulls of the hard fork, Core can just merge the blocksize increase and stay relevant and Core devs can continue to work on Core. Or they contribute to Classic. It all doesn't matter. This isn't about choosing a team, it's all about choosing that one blocksize change that Core wasn't willing to make. Whether the devs continue working on Bitcoin, whichever fork, is up to them. Nobody is getting fired, and no team is really in charge.

Good point, that makes sense. It's just that I first got interested when I realised that bitcoin solves an interesting computer science problem.

Just don't tell anyone about your bitcoins. Nobody will care and nobody will bother tracing anything and even so there is no proof the coins are yours. So you bought them at some point and transferred them to some address. You could have bought something with it, you could have gifted them to someone, you could have lost the keys, they could have been stolen etc etc.
It's only an issue when you sell them and it's linked to your name/account. Just don't sell them on any exchange but use them instead or sell anonymously.
