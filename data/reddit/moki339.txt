Apparently started as a meme. Mimics someone fast-typing hold incorrectly to save the other person from making a mistake, that is, selling at a loss.

Becky will soon be asking you how many internet-coins  you have ����

but we all know that gov agencies don't "destroy" coins.. They are not idiots.. They would just auction it like in the US, or give it someone else :P

I completely support HODLing your coins at this point (but who am I? ;))
Only thing I suggest is trying to take your coins off your exchanges and into your offline wallets. I am away from my nano S now but can't wait to travel back home and secure my coins from exchanges :)
Stay Positive. Hodl.

Looks like americans are enjoying the sale!!
Could be dead cat bounce but probably wall street bonuses coming in at perfect timing for NAM regions.
Hodling through...

This is JUST a precautionary step in case govs crack down on exchanges or an exchange decides to shut down without a warning.
As a rule of thumb, I keep most of my coins on a Nano S offline wallet. Only coins that I trade with or are not yet supported bt nano s are kept on exchanges.
