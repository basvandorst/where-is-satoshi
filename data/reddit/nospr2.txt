I only hold about $100 at most in cash at any point.
@_date: 2016-08-09 20:13:01
Don't put all your eggs in one basket. I would never even put a full 50% of my savings in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:16:36
If everyone holds, no one sells, trades, or buys using it, then how does it have any value?
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:00:02
I'd argue that if you kept your money in the dotcom "bubble" you would be rich right now.
Consider apple stock, it dropped a lot when the market crashed in the early 2000s, but if you look at Apple Stock today, it's huge compared to 20 years ago. If you bought in Apple in 1998 and kept it today you would have a huge return.

It's like getting them a gift card to a store that charges you $50 dollars to use the gift card. And the company could go bankrupt any moment (go to go to the moon)

Litecoin is only $200. You'll be saying the same exact thing if litcoin made it big too.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:32:46
It didn't sound like a cult 2 years ago when I bought in. Everyone happily talked about the positives and negatives about bitcoin. It seemed like the perfect time to buy. Now it's the opposite everything is hype about the price while the fees go out of control, vendors drop the coin, and you have informed people spending their entire savings thinking they'll get rich.

It easily is a bubble and everyone knows it. The reason why people won't short it is because we don't know if it will crash at 20k, 40k, 60k or is already started the crash yesterday.

Bcash it worth about 0.2 bitcoin. I made the trade and I was able to buy Bitcoin using Bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:16:04
The difference is that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are both forks of the same source. It would be like if Nike split into two companies and one side that was bigger called themselves Nike and the smaller called themselves Nike Shoes. Then you had fans of Nike calling the small one NShoes.

One of the selling points of bitcoin is that you own your own private keys. I don't understand why everyone is willingly giving up their private keys to a 3rd party that they seem to all hate.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:56:24
Why are you keeping coins in an exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:43:03
I've already cashed out my initial investment, so I'm also just here for the ride. However the ride is getting less fund with the mania that's going on this month. Dollar signs in eyes speak louder than anything else.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:22:39
Put it this way if you had that entire amount in your bank right now, would you be willing to re-invest that and lose it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:30:17
Do people not hold their bitcoin in their own private wallet? I have no idea everyone on this subreddit seems to have all their coins in one bitcoin exchange. Did anyone not read about what happened to Mt. Gox?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:40:10
What's the difference between people spreading overt negative information trying to a price decrease and spreading overt positive information trying for a price increase? I'd argue that bitcoin functioned better and faster in the $300 to $800 range.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:24:57
I have no idea why would are angry, if people are afraid of bitcoin cash taking money away from bitcoin, why not hold a little bit in both?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:41:07
I've seen one store that's had a 50% off sale for over 5 years.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:36:17
Holders don't use bitcoin as money though. They keep it in one wallet and don't use it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:05:30
Online wallets are the most risky version of wallets. Just look up Mt. Gox, BTC-e all shutting down for good or any of the numerous times that coinbase and other exchanges shut down for days during big price changes.
People lost millions in Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:32:40
Why don't you short Bitcoin Cash then?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:38:22
If people only have bitcoin just because of the price, then it shows that these people now into bitcoin are only in it for the idea of striking rich.
Improve the technology and you create a more stable coin to hold and trade in. I still am mostly in bitcoin but with the fees, the forks, the craze, I don't know anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:47:12
Why would wall street want bitcoins? The only reason we think bitcoins have value is because we think that we can buy them and then sell them to someone else for a higher value than what we paid for them.
If wall street were to buy bitcoins, who on earth would they sell the coins back to to make money?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:34:01
No one should be storing their coins in an online exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:41:26
Bitcoin has crashed many times though. Crashed to 2 dollars, crashed to $50, crashed to $150. The guess is where it will crash to during the next crash. Any speculation after that is crazy talk.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:32:30
This was happening far far before Coinbase started.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:19:00
Sounds like a cult. If the idea of talking about negatives about bitcoin is considered an attack, bitcoin is moving towards a religious mentality instead an actual discussion on technology.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:20:10
You're entirely free to take your coins out of coinbase and stop using it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:33:42
Bitcoin Cash is popular because it's cheaper to buy than Bitcoin and the fees are lower. I don't have any Bitcoin Cash though, i already sold mine.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:14:31
Classic money making technique, buy high and sell low!
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:22:19
I can't log into the site on my computer or on my phone. You would think at this point they would at least let you access your bitcoins. Extreme bullshit.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:26:06
So where else can I easily buy bitcoins then?
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:32:46
What would you recommend?
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:29:16
Exactly, I've been trying to log in for the last 20 minutes trying to buy even just one bitcoin.
It's the cynic in me, but I almost feel that they don't want anyone to buy bitcoin when it's this cheap all of a sudden.
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:59:40
There is a large amount of Chinese bitcoin users, so that's your answer.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:31:49
Most of the bot tipping services now use smaller coins instead.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:36:34
That's why I have a feeling that 5900 wasn't the bottom for this year. Bitcoin will hit the real bottom when all is lost, when even this subreddit is claiming the end of bitcoin and everyone is way too scared to buy in. The last huge run up to 1100 years ago didn't crash at the bottom until about 200. In the time when it was 200, even I was scared to buy bitcoin and only bought one near the bottom. This subreddit was a graveyard and mainstream news didn't touch bitcoin for years. Sure I could be wrong, but this last week just has felt like a classic pump and dump.
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:37:12
So... in the rare event that it drops below 7k again, where do you think the true bottom is? 6k for a double bottom or freefall to something like 2k?
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:32:58
Because this month bitcoin is around the highest price ever. It's been getting a lot of new media attention.
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:45:43
Bitcoin goes up and down constantly.
