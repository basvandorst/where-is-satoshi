Dear yuilleb,
I want to thank you for your business with Chase and Bitcoin. By using our services, you have helped us grow into a globally competitive financial institution. Your report of this incident only adds further incentive to carry out our current strategies.
As a key member of Bitcoin leadership and speaking for the Official Board of Bitcoin, I want to apologize for the experience you received at Chase. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is responsible for millions of bank accounts, investment services, and global financial instruments worth trillions of US dollars. Chase is constantly challenged with ways to ensure their services are provided at great speed and with minimal cost while not allowing the use of services by illegal enterprises. Chase is currently working to integrate Bitcoin on a core level but as with any large company, not every department is fully informed on this key strategic direction.
We have reached out to Chase's compliance department to help them understand bitcoin transfers, their relative speed, effectiveness, and inevitability; and are currently working with them to develop better controls and a set of reasonable actions that would be appropriate when possible illegal activity is detected.
Finally, it must be mentioned that Chase must operate under the authority of FinCEN's TMI/FML requirements and the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). As such, I want to further assure you that we are also working on new legislation on both state and federal levels to help bring our capabilities to users everywhere with a minimum of impact on banking relationships.
Please keep us posted as your situation develops and we look forward to helping service your financial needs going forward.
Chairman of the Official Board of Bitcoin
President of Bitcoin United Management, IBC
