You never heard of the Porsche 918 and the Carerra GT ? You are right to those are hyper cars. Also Porsche GT2/3 is not a super car ? Wont get more Super than that.

Most people have more adresses and pool their coins in one. Everytime on an exchange you generate a new address and they put all the coins in a few addresses right away. This number does not tell you how many people those addresses own.

There is plenty of Silkroad like sites. Illicit activity is not a factor anymore.  The Darknet is maybe able to keep it around 1000 on its own. But for 1 Million we need big banks to get into it.

Porsche Mission E no Contest. 15 minutes for 80% charge. High build quality inside and out. Long range (300+ miles). Plenty fast and extremly stylish, possibly the best looking Sedan ever.  Also same price range as a Model S

I always understood the Lambo meme in such a way. That you only buy it once the price of a lambo does not even register as a serious expense. Also It makes sense to buy Exotic cars if you have like 5 of them and you put a few miles on each. And you buy them new and you have some that are sought after you can sell them for a profit and basically did not spend any money owning them. For example a Porsche 918 is double the price it once was. Same for the Porsche 911 R even with miles on it.

If you are implying that 3% of all possible wallets are holding those 95% of Bitcoins: He is refering to active wallets. We have not even used 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% of the possible wallets.  (I just made random zeros its way way less than that)

you mean a gallardo ? Any other Lambo will cost 150k+  and the cheapest Gallardos are 65k rn. Usually it will set you back another 10k to fix the Clutch as those have to be fixed constantly in the gallardo.

Why does Germany have so much gold ? Its like 40% of what  the US has and the second biggest goldreserve of any nation. 11 times more than UK. But its only the 4th biggest Economy.

Its at 60 Cents, marketcap is 5 Million. Who buys it and why ?

The final  versions was supposed to look like this: Eth is supposed to be capped at 120 Million and stakers get roughly 5% return a year that will be payed through fees ? And the more stakers the smaller the return. No new coins minted ? Also if bad actors abuse the staking system they will lose up to 10% of their stake and that gets burned and taken out of circulation forever. Well atleast thats what I hear recently.
I think anything is up to debate with Eth right now.

This looks like fake news. First this website is totally unknown. Second the way its written and formated is unusual. Sounds like a hype peace. And also I can not find anything anywhere on other media outlets in Germany. This seems to be made up.

Wouldnt actually work. At some point very soon there would be a quantity of beer that can not be divided anymore, the infinite mathematicans can only get the smallest possible amount of "beer" which would actually be 95 Water molecules and 5 Ethanol molecules. So he would need infinite beer to serve them.

There is a near limitless supply of gold. We could coat the earth several feet thick with the gold thats in the earths core. There is 1000s of Asteroids that each has more gold and other precious metals than we ever extracted from the earth. Deep sea mining will be a thing there is also huge amounts of gold there. The supply of gold is near limitless, we are only limited by our own technology. Also its possible to synthesize gold in nuclear reactors.

If it really goes up again then right now is cheap. Might even go to an all time high this year and never drop under 10k ever again. Any time is a good time to buy if you truly believe in the future of bitcoin.

I am not a lambo fan by any means but they are not unreliable anymore. Maybe before the 2000s. Or if you compare them to a toyota. But since VW took over there are less and less issues especially the huracan is a rock solid car.

Its not random you just dont know all the factors involved.

Well that would just lead to billionaires being murdered and the suspect would be anyone. If their coins vanish after their death. Everyone elses coins will have a higher value.

Well there is a loss of Crypto over a certain time period because people die and did not pass their keys on or lost their keys or send coins to the wrong adress. At some point there will be less newly minted BTC then lost BTC and we will have a shrinking supply. But I am not sure thats a good thing.
