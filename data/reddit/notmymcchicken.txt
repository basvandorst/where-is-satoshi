I think wallets should start implemeting an "account" system under your wallet address. You'll have your regular Savings account (BTC main chain balance), and you'll have your Lightning account (LN balance). Making this intuitive and easy to use in the GUIs would be awesome and really spur adoption imo. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:25:49
2 trillion is perfectly feasible and would be a 10x from here (so around 100k per coin). 2 trillion isn’t even 1/3 of golds global market cap. 
13 trillion is a joke. Idk who is thinking that large but they need to calm down. You’re the first I’ve heard mention that number. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:10:56
Those evaluations would put the total market cap on par with Golds.  Not entirely unreasonable all things considered...

40 trillion would have the price in the 1.8-2.1 million per coin range. And thats assuming all 21 million are circulating. Which they aren't and never will.
2.1 trillion would have the price at 100k per coin. 2.1 trillion isn't even half the market of gold alone... it's entirely possible.

1 dollar is too fucking high when there are countless other transactional platforms that are absolutely free.
You are basically totally conceding bitcoins function as a form of commerce in favor of it being totally, 100% a store of value. Which is cool I guess, but quit being disingenuous by suggesting 1 dollar fees are acceptable. They are not. At least not for half of bitcoins function.

Hundreds of cryptos can accomplish the same thing, if not better, for no cost. But that is not the point. 
Bitcoin loses its value as a means of exchange when fees are through the roof for normal transactions. At a certain point, people would rather use centralized alternatives (such as Venmo/Paypal) that are free rather then pay the astronomical fees that Bitcoin requires. Because news flash: most everyday folk don't give a fuck about decentralization and "no trust required" model. They care about cost and efficiency. That's it. 
Losing transactions diminishes Bitcoin's use cases and therefore limits its value going forward. Our competition is not against other cryptos, but the entire e-commerce digital transaction sector as a whole. We lose to them more and more with high fees.

Their business plan is to make money. They make money on every single transaction, they aren't worried about beating the market. Having down time during high traffic intervals is directly costing their company massive amounts of money. You act like they plan to shutdown their servers purposely during high trading times... quite the opposite. 
The entire point of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency IS immediacy. Why wouldn't I expect the bare minimum from a company with 5 billion in digital assets? Give me a break. 
This is the dumbest logic I ever seen on this sub, and that's saying something... You're quite smug for someone who has no idea what they're talking about.

Care to elaborate on how deflationary currencies couldn’t do loans? How does anything change? I loan you BTC at a fixed rate, you pay it back in a fixed time plus interest. How wouldn’t this work? 
The lenders would be either banks or private institutions that have amassed great amounts of the decentralized currency either through separate lending or otherwise. 
Genuinely curious what you think the obstacles would be. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 16:43:35

Empires have been built and have fallen throughout history for much smaller reasons. The fact that you completely dismiss this possibility is extremely near sighted and dismissive. You act as if a switch needs to flip and suddenly the world economy collapses. That's not how this works. That's not what is happening. Yes *is* happening. As in right now. 
Any currencies value is set by the folks who value it. The same can be said for commodities like gold. What is gold's inherent value? It's shiny? No. Gold's value exists because it is believed to exist. It is believed to be a hedge against fiat. 
Your entire comment chain comes off as ignorant to the entire crypto tech space. I'd suggest you do a bit more reading behind blockchain tech and the ways it is continuously changing the global finance industry before you claim to know what you are sure of.

You will get instant transfers with Gemini once you're approved, (could take a couple days). Once you place an order your BTC will be held on Gemini's exchange until the money clears from your bank account. It'll then be free to move to your Mycelium wallet. Hope this helps.

Good point. There's always negative application of newer tech. It's just dealing with that FUD when the future of it is so critical of adoption.

The problem is I cannot get Breadwallet to sync no matter what I do ... It never shows my coins in the wallet. Any idea how to fix this?
@_date: 2016-10-30 02:22:41
As long as it levels out close to 700 I consider it a huge win. People are selling hard on that 700 number. It'll be nice to see if we can hold stead fast and not dip too severely.

No one knows. Anyone that acts like they do is a liar. If we could predict the price we'd all be millionaires. Just buy a little at a time and take solace in the fact that you're still extremely early.

I think you've got it backwards. Marketcap is an indicator of how widely something is becoming bought on a regular basis. The ATM's and real world uses come AFTER mass adoption. So again, ETH's market cap is rapidly approaching BTC's and this isn't a concern to anyone here?
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:53:16
Yes, it makes progress but never shows the funds. I think this is because my other wallet apps use a different recovery protocol then Breadwallet? 
@_date: 2017-05-01 18:37:42
Right, because being opposed to opening the flood gates to refugees automatically makes you a racist.

Fuck you for thinking anyone cares about your pathetic life that you broadcast you selling your bitcoins on an Internet forum thinking it will influence the price even more. Sad little man.

The Mycelium iOS app is quite clunky and is supported by an entirely separate group then the Mycelium Android community. It also lacks some security features.

@_date: 2017-05-30 13:07:19
idk. part of me is excited at ETH's growth, but another part of me feels that a lot of it is due to Bitcoins scaling debate (people moving money from BTC and temporarily flocking to ETH). Come August 1st, when this blows over, It could be a bad day for ETH
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:09:24
Join the club hahaha... no regrets man. You're here now, and by all accounts its still extremely early. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:40:34
What is driving this marketcap increase recently? Are people jumping from BTC into ETH in preparation for the possibility of a UASF on Aug. 1st? 
This surely can't all be new adoption

Great analogy. So basically if/when I ever need to recover this wallet using this phrase, I'll have to use Breadwallet or another wallet that is compatible? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:56:05
That is correct. This is using a recovery phrase that has been used in other wallets to retrieve my funds. I believe this is due to Breadwallet using a different protocol? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:25:32
Sadly, I don't think you ever will. The coins and outstanding balances will be returned to Mt. Gox. Gox will likely then begin the process of recovery. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 11:44:38
I wouldn't say it's about to ... still 15~ billion behind. But yeah, its gaining. Fast.

How tf do you know the price will be 1000? Good luck catching the knife

Wow look at you using logic, understanding and reasoning! You live up to your name. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:59:13
How isn't it good news? BTC-e made up 3% of daily volume. Hardly a major player. The price was barely affected. 
And by solving this case, it allows for users from the Mt. Gox debacle to possibly have some light at the end of the tunnel. It solves one of the biggest black clouds surrounding the space for years. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 14:45:53
I'm of the opinion that we are at a critical time for Bitcoin and crypto, and a chain split of the largest and most viable coin will hurt momentum going forward. In the far long term, I still think Bitcoin with thrive, but this can be an ugly speed bump a long the way. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:44:53

Yeah +1 .. great app 
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:58:44
It's all a gamble. At the time, you made the right decision for you in terms of things you needed funds for. Unfortunately in reality it wound up being a bad play.
This is an impossible prediction either up or down. We're all just along for the ride... wherever that may take us. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:35:26
No. We'll just adjust to mBTC and Bits.

Venmo is not actually peer to peer. Venmo is fiat based. Venmo works as a middle man for the banks. Venmo and Bitcoin are not even nearly relate-able.

You do realize that any alt that had the mass adoption that Bitcoin has seen would have these same scaling issues currently, right? This is apart of the growth of the technology. Enjoy the ride. 
Additionally, a 4 dollar fee is still a bargain as opposed to traditional banking methods. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:02:35
So it is possible to have a recovery phrase that is the same for 2 separate wallets (1 being breadwallet, the other being CoPay) and only have 1 wallet show a balance? Thats so strange lol
Can you explain to me why this is possible?
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:16:56
Absolute insanity. Great news for crypto as well. If true, this man cost people millions, created a 3 year bear market in Bitcoin, and set us back years in the adoption phase.
I'm glad he has been caught. And I hope anyone that lost coins in the Mt.Gox debacle can somehow retain them.
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:44:26
Solid TA that seems to be holding water. Good work mate. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:41:25
Bitcoin is never fully unattainable... Considering we can simply move to other denominations, such as mBTC, Bits and Satoshi. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:21:49
The answer is, there is no answer. No one knows. If you are interested in the tech buy a little every pay day (that you can afford to) and join the ride.
If you ask me, Bitcoin and the Cryptocurrency world as a whole are very much in their infancy. So there's no better time then the present.
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:19:36
Because they aren't exorbitant compared to any other mainstream payment service. They just aren't what regular/OG bitcoin users are accustomed to.

@_date: 2017-06-09 19:46:34
So true. In essence, bitcoin and cryptos are exactly what the average zerohedge reader dreams about. Most think they already missed the gravy boat so they're  salty.
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:49:09
I'd argue it makes the price even more deflated, considering the coins are lost forever, making every other bitcoin that much more scarce. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:09:00
such intensity. much scare

The price will drop. Dips do happen. The question is when? Will it drop from 2650 to 1500? Or from 3500 to 2900? No one knows. So just get in and enjoy the ride.

Bitcoin is going to concede the  market cap spot. But it doesn't matter. I believe BTC and ETH will continue to operate as Gold and Silver of the crypto world. Together they will hold 70%+ of the total crypto market cap.
