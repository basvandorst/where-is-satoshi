Most interesting... It does sound like a pain in the ass to sell.. it’s always hard when u have to play a lot of games to get the money out of nowhere... 
something strikes me in this... here investors avoid selling to cashless ppl properties in development, since they have no use of them, if they don’t give them cash upfront, they may as well build and sell later to who ever they want...

Where do you develop? I am in a similar line of business, but these days it’s not that hard to sell developments around here (Croatia) , we are not that regulated and any cash will do, nobody gives a shit about age or anything....

That reminds me a bit of the Russians before 2008., buying everything inflating markets and speaking Russian is a must...
They are gone now, which actually is probably good long term since the market is much more stable... nowadays what’s inflating and pushing the market a bit is the cheap money from Germany.. but that feels much more natural since we have always been a natural expansion of their interests ... and it’s mostly some common middle class ppl getting a second house.. Russians were all about lots of new money needs spending....
Wonder if the Chinese money will really get everywhere, I didn’t deal with them, but I already heard they are buying here and there nearby...
