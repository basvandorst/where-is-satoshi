Is LN and segwit decentralized or is it a privately owned network just like the MasterCards and Visas network build on top of fiat currencies?
Same thing for segwit, how are LN and segwit respecting or moving away from the original bitcoin crypto anarchist vision?

Past gains are not an indicator of future gains, this makes me think about survivor bias. Everything has a life cycle.

From my limited experience with crypto currency I think you've summed up well the value and usefulness of bitcoin and some of the altcoins. What I still cannot wrap my head around is why do we need to have so many different types of coins. I mean the primary interest of the a crypto currency is to be a vehicle of value which is independent from states and big Banks, easy to keep and to transfer around the world and this is wonderful. But once you have this crypto currency why is there any need for another one? More anonymity? Ok I get it. Faster transfers, that I understand too. But then, unused storage? Unused computing power? Implementation of contracts? These are more services than value to me, does it mean there could be a specific currency just to buy antivirus services for example? Then why not a specific currency just to go to the movies or buy a coffee? Wouldn't too many crypto currencies kill crypto currencies? And couldn't most services offered by crypto currencies been embedded into blockchain without creating a separate brand new currency? I'm still trying to wrap my head around the whole crypto currency phenomenon...
