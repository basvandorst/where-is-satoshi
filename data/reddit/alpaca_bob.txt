@_date: 2015-06-01 23:35:22
Miners, mining pools and full node providers *are* third parties.
If you make it so that not everyone can mine and/or run a full node, that means we need to trust third parties.
We're getting pretty close already.
@_date: 2015-06-16 20:15:41


If you don't see that's an argument *against* free markets, not the other way round, I don't know what to say.
*Of course* the domains with superior names have an advantage. And it's not as if we can compete for these names freely, you were just the first to control them as you were one of the first to hear about Bitcoin.
And that's not even taking the network effect (=natural monopoly) into account.
@_date: 2015-12-25 22:12:33
I think so.

@_date: 2015-06-25 20:36:49


Yes that would be interesting.


What's the point of that if I may ask? If the "real clients" raise their fees, that would just mean that the test is working right? A fee market is establishing, while spam is being blocked effectively. Hurray!


I'd say that it makes more sense that those who claim that the sky is falling should cough up the dough.
But whatever. It's not gonna matter who we believe should pay for such a test anyways :)
(By the way, neither RBF nor CPFP are Blockstream products.)
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:11:33
Of course Bitcoin can. You'll just need to pay a fee.
@_date: 2015-06-20 07:28:14


Seems like not much has changed then. People who are concerned about the costs of scaling are downvoted and ridiculed.
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:23:10
As Bram Cohen put it:
[To claim that high fees are a disaster is like saying ‘Nobody goes there any more, it’s too crowded.’](
I think you should take Mike Hearn a bit less serious. Even Gavin thinks it won't be *that* bad. (And neither do *any* of the other core devs, of course.)
Also, it seems like you are referring to lightning and side chains, while I'm just arguing that *sooner or later* a fee market will need to be established somehow. If that spells disaster, we might as well discontinue this whole experiment right now.

- Decrease in inflation (still ~10% a year).
- Wall Street entering in a big way (green light for Winklevoss' COIN).
- A use case that will bring bitcoin to the masses.
@_date: 2015-06-25 21:39:28
How would you suggest the network stays secure once the block reward has dropped to zero? Where does the incentive for miners to mine come from then?
@_date: 2015-06-24 23:04:08


No it doesn't "push" most of the transactions to centralized companies. You'd just have to pay a fee if you don't want to use such a company.
While if you raise the block size too much, that *would* push transactions to centralized nodes as it would become impossible for some to actually run a full node.
The question is not centralization vs. decentralization, and to present it like that is either ignorant or disingenuous. 
If anything, the question is what kind of centralization is the lesser evil. And even that is debatable, as decentralized solutions that could function on top of a small blockchain are possible and currently being build.
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:44:18
I don't like that idea at all.
Also: 
@_date: 2015-06-25 19:48:48
If that's the big problem, it sounds like child-pays-for-parent can solve it quite easily.
Also, I personally think it's rather important to make sure Bitcoin remains decentralized and becomes economically sustainable on the longer term. If that means businesses on top of Bitcoin - like pools and exchanges - need to change their ways... so be it?
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:51:54
If the maximum block size was .1mb, the block chain would be much smaller now.
@_date: 2015-06-25 22:04:25
First of, nobody is arguing that the block size must remain at 1 MB forever. (Really, if that's what you've been told, you have been misinformed. Which wouldn't be that strange, because there is a LOT of misinformation floating around. Especially on r/bitcoin.)
Second, you didn't answer my question?
@_date: 2015-06-10 11:04:35
Although none of this was part of my initial argument, I'm not sure you are right about this either.
Services like Satoshidice and Reddit-tipping might not have moved off chain if the maximum block size was always 20mb, meaning we might have surpassed 1mb by now.

@_date: 2015-06-26 08:34:30


And that's one of the big problems I have with the "big blockians".
The small blockians have a solution that may or may not work.
The big blockians don't have any solution whatsoever.
I would prefer to try out the small blockian solution that may or may not work. (And on a side note, that was how the system was always designed.) 
If it doesn't work, then at least we know for sure that we really do need to come up with another solution. (And unfortunately, the only other solution I see right now is to remove the 21m cap of coins at some point, and continue to fund the miners through inflation forever. Pretty sure you don't want that either?..)

Spam transactions are the reason Satoshi implemented a block size limit in the first place.
Just saying.
@_date: 2015-06-19 14:52:34
So then it's not really a problem for merchants, is it?
And it might help establish a fee market better than the current situation.
@_date: 2015-06-02 11:22:19


Although that is true of course, censorship by miners would be MUCH worse than anything Paypal/Coinbase/Circle can do, since you can always choose not to use Paypal/Coinbase/Circle, while you cannot always choose not to use the miners.
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:36:28

Equally, if one miner accepts RBF transactions, then it doesn't matter whether Bitcoin Core supports it or not.
@_date: 2015-06-17 14:25:36

Because they were forced to.


They could be forced to.
And the bigger the block size, the more likely that becomes.

What alternative system does Bitcoin Core lead developer Wladimir van der Laan want bitcoin users to migrate to?
@_date: 2015-06-25 10:19:00

@_date: 2015-06-10 10:08:52
The recommending of Bitcoin-QT to new Bitcoin users became a faux because the blockchain had grown too big and it became too much of a burden for regular Joe run QT on his computer.
That has everything to do with the block size. A bigger block size would make it worse.
(I don't consider myself a regular Joe, but I stopped running QT for this exact reason.)

What's the difference?
Are you saying that the free market doesn't work properly in the context of the current domain name registration system? Because that's exactly what I am saying.

Yes. And that's exactly what me and a lot of others will do. Once transactions on the Bitcoin network are being censored, people will just use PayPal or some other centralized service instead, since it's a lot easier to use and Bitcoin has no clear advantage anymore.
The core value proposition of Bitcoin is its decentralized nature. Take that away, and I don't see what the point is.
@_date: 2014-09-26 12:46:01
1. Yes, but only if it's meant for speculation, buying stuff on the digital black markets, or possibly remittance. There might be more use cases in the future that haven't been invented though.
2. Yep. Don't invest more than what you're willing to lose.
3. Kind of depends on how you're promoting Bitcoin, I guess. There's lots of ideological reasons to be involved though.

@_date: 2014-05-27 17:21:12
Well, in that case it's a good thing that Bitcoin is not deflationary. It's inflationary, as it quite literally makes for an expansion of the total money supply. On top of that, moreover, altcoins are cause for even more inflation. Isn't that great!
People who criticize Bitcoin for being deflationary or having a hard cap totally miss the point. That is: this currency - as opposed to fiat currencies - is not monopolistic. That's a humongous difference and makes almost all existing monetary theory useless.
For the record: I disagree with almost everything you say, I just don't care to get into one of these inflation/deflation debates again. The truth is that economics is not an exact science, it's a social science. As such, you can't predict what will or won't happen in the future any more than anthropologists can - but this seems very hard for economists to accept.
Krugman and people who hold him in high regard will say [one thing]( the guys at Mises and people who hold them in hight regard will say [another]( Truth is that neither can know for sure, hence both of them are just guessing.

Bitcoin has been forked, and several superior versions have already been published. Yet, they do not threaten the hegemony of Bitcoin.
This is because Bitcoin also relies on it's network effect for value. This includes services, users, merchants, services build on top, etc. etc.
Until you can fork these as well, which you can't, the "threat" of a developer publishing his own version is negligible. Which means that the "threat" of ignoring him is negligible as well.

Yes, I absolutely agree! The USD is less volatile because it has much more liquidity. As Bitcoin grows it will become more stable as well.
But I don't recall a Taleb model regarding a tipping point actually?
I was referring to black swan events (and fragility/antifragility).
The USD is a fragile system. Some unforeseen event could cause hyperinflation or even a collapse. We've seen this happen with lots of fiat systems, and we almost saw it happen with the USD in '08. The only reason the system didn't collapse in '08 is because the banks got bailed out with tax payer money, which is outrageous given their previous and current profits.
As Mitch Feierstein has put it:
"The financial system will never be worthy of trust while any institution is TBTF. Heads I win, tails you bail me out: that's not capitalism,it's extortion."
And in case you're still looking for it, here's some stats on inflation:
Not to mention that the US exports a lot of inflation, which is an important reason why several countries want to abandon the dollar as world reserve currency.

The video is from 2012, way before anyone could have expected that anything was amiss at MtGox. (By the way, we still don't know what happened.)
Moreover, the whole point of him mentioning Gox is that he thinks that it is a bad idea to trust a centralized organization like that. So you're basically taking his warning and turning it against him.
The reason that banks can lend out money easily is 1) they don't lend out money, they create it on the spot as credit, and 2) if the loans turn sour they don't have to deal with the problem since they'll be bailed out by the rest of society. None of this has anything to do with trust. Moreover, this is precisely what caused the financial crisis, and it's making a very small group of people very rich while the rest of us are burdened with huge mortgages and inflation.
@_date: 2014-05-27 09:18:32
It's not as if bonds are the only way to pay for roads, welfare, etc. You can still tax people without having to issue bonds. Or you can create money yourself to do so - no need to borrow it. (Check out "Positive Money".) Bonds probably *are* the only way to pay for total war though - that's why they were invented.
Also, there is absolutely no way that the US will ever pay back all of its debt to foreign countries. It's just that these countries are invaded with American armies and/or army bases, and that Uncle Sam will probably not be to fond of these countries if they stop buying bonds.

Go and read Satoshi's white paper please.
Bitcoin is not private money. It's trustless money. There's a crucial difference.
The core fundamental of Bitcoin is that it does not (should not) require trust in a third party to function. Whether or not *you* trust GHash is not the point. The point is that I, and many like me, do not trust our money with *any* third party, including GHash. That's why we got into Bitcoin in the first place.
If this issue doesn't get resolved, it might not necessarily break Bitcoin, but it will definitely keep the price from moving up. Why? Because I, and many people like me, don't trust our money with GHash (ie. Bitcoin right now).

I wish I had the answer to that. But I don't.
For now, I think it's probably very important to have several much used Bitcoin-implementations build by very different dev's. 
In an ideal situation, the best-used version should still have less than 50% of the network, and preferably much less. So kind of like the mining pools.

Your other examples are kind of silly. I don't have to trust anyone to make sure that the shirt I'm wearing fits.
But if it makes you feel better, I will phrase it differently. I don't want to have to trust people who I don't trust with my *money*. Money is such a crucial factor in life, the blood of most social interactions if you will, that I don't want to have to rely on anyone else for it, because that someone else could potentially deprive you from buying food and paying rent and basically everything else. 
This risk is not even hypothetical these days. Wikileaks was blocked from receiving any donations, pornstars in the US have been unable to get a bank accounts... the required trust in a third party for a something as important as money has been used as an extension of law enforcement.

He's a man who has come up with a nice idea, although I'm pretty sure that idea is not as new or revolutionary as he claims it to be.
Moreover, he acts and talks as if he is the only "philosopher" in the history in the world who has ever used rationale, while this is in reality the basis for most of Western thought - including the justification of the state. (This is covered in Thomas Hobbes' social contract.)
As such, Molyneux does nothing but strike down strawmen. And he does it with a lot of disdain.
Now don't misinterpret me, as has happened over and over again in this sub. I'm not some kind of "statist" blindly defending the status quo. I'm willing to hear a well reasoned rebuttal of the social contract (and therefore the existence of a state), but Molyneux hasn't given me one.

It would be a bit of a hassle, but by mixing you pre-fork coins with a tiny bit of post-fork coins (1 satoshi) the problem would be solved and there would be two types of Bitcoin.
Presumably services might pop up that take care of that little operation for a .1% cut or whatever.

That would probably depend on how much you bought each week?

I see no reason why exchanges would want to disenfranchise one segment of their user base. More likely, they will offer markets for both Bitcoin versions, and if they're smart they would even allow a market between one type of Bitcoin and the other.
(If existing exchanges don't do this, new ones most certainly will.)

If 20 full nodes switch, the new type of Bitcoin will be supported by 20 full nodes.
If 50 switch, the new type of Bitcoin will be supported by 50 full nodes.
If 100 switch, the new type of Bitcoin will be supported by 100 full nodes.
Ideally, all full nodes switch or none of them do. Otherwise you split the network into two types of Bitcoin.

So if a majority (say maybe 90 or 95%) wants to change the code to allow for more than 21 million bitcoins, the same logic applies, right?
And 90 or 95% of what exactly? Nodes? Miners? Users? Potential users? The community?

Money that was created out of nothing by the banks.
Two parties are at fault here: the banks and Greece.
Yet the banks got bailed out, while the Greeks are made to suffer. 
edit: Not to mention that many of these Greeks were in no way responsible for Greece's troubles, since it's the younger generation that's being hit hardest. They couldn't even vote, ten years ago.
Meanwhile, the Goldman Sachs banker who got Greece into the euro made millions, perhaps even billions, and is still doing very well.

Yes, you are totally wrong actually. Lightning does not require a centralized third party (such as Blockstream) that can charge fees.
Basically, the Lightning network allows for many transactions to be fit into a single transaction. So event though the cost of this "single transaction" could go up, the "many transactions" will cost less per transaction.
Also, Blockstream agrees that Lightning will need a block size limit bigger than 1 MB eventually.
@_date: 2015-07-26 12:44:52
Do you know how Lightning works?
Do you know what centralised means?
If so, could you maybe explain why Lightning *would* be centralized? Because I'm not sure where I'd have to start explaining how it's not centralized. It's just... not.
And while you are at it, could you perhaps explain how the fee system works if space in blocks is not limited?

I think it's actually more like: the website has always been inaccurate, since *at some point* there *will* need to be some kind of fee pressure.
So they are considering removing inaccurate information, that has been highlighted due to this whole block size debate.

I agree it's not just a technical problem. But it's almost as if you are using a regulatory argument as a technical argument.


That sounds very much like you are talking about technical parameters.


Sure, but unlike technical parameters, laws and regulation are quite easy to change.

If bitcoin is a sort of digital gold, it implies that it is typically usefull as a hedge against inflation and market movements. That holds that news of collapsing currencies and crashing stock markets is relevant for this sub.
@_date: 2015-07-14 12:16:17


And as I already stated that's not the loans I'm talking about. I'm talking about what happened - like - ten years ago. Not what happened in the past couple of years. I'm talking about how the problems were created, not how they were "solved".
The initial loans were most certainly extended by banks. And it's these banks that needed to be saved (bailed out) five years ago. (Indeed by Eurozone nations who extended the Greeks with new loans in order to pay for the initial loans.)

@_date: 2015-07-22 11:34:18
I agree. But that doesn't exclude what I said. The devs are doing what they think is best to keep the code working, or to move the project forward if you will.
What I'm sick of hearing are these "hur dur blockstream" ad hominems. 
There are plenty of people who don't work for Blockstream that still believe smaller blocks are better.
Moreover, it seems like there is no winning for these guys. If they would argue for small blocks and alternative solutions to scale Bitcoin, the reddit pitchfork community would (and does) yell: "That doesn't even exist!
Now they are building it, and people yell: "You only want smaller blocks because of your own projects!1~
At the very least, I would hope that this community could refrain from name calling and personal attacks, and somehow find a way to cooperate constructively (this goes for both sides of the debate). If we can't do that, I'm afraid the block size is the least of our problems.

While I appreciate your efforts of writing all of that up, I feel like you missed my point almost entirely. 
To emphasize: there is an important difference between *unfair* and *undesirable*. And again, I never said Bitcoin's wealth distribution is unfair. Juts that I think people will find it undesirable.
You actually touch upon this yourself:


Exactly. And I think people will choose not to (use it as a store of value), because of the extreme wealth distribution. They will in the end prefer gold, or some other crypto, or whatever.

What are you suggestion exactly?
Are you suggesting that people like Wladimir van der Laan, Greg Maxwell, Peter Todd, Luke-jr, Amir Taaki, Adam Back, theymos, Jon Matonis, etc. etc. etc. don't care about Bitcoin succeeding?
And if so,do you really believe that? *Really?*
It's funny because I would actually rather argue the exact opposite. All of these guys I just named are very passionate and entirely dedicated to making Bitcoin succeed. Most of them have been working on it for years without even getting paid. I think they would be devastated if the project failed.
A lot of these investors, however, I suspect would shrug it off and move on to the next big thing.

Hmno I just want as much as possible (yes in total). 
The "where they meet" part is already included in that number. (If the miners want 22 million bitcoins as a transaction fee, they will get a total of zero bitcoins in fees, as no one will be willing to pay 22 million bitcoins. So 22 million is clearly not as high as possible, because it adds up to a total zero. The same will probably be true for 10 million. Etc.)

Yes, that is because your original argument didn't make any sense in light of my position.
Again, my position is that if banks create money ("out of thin air") as debt, and this debt cannot be repaid for whatever reason, that means two parties screwed up. In this case Greece for not being able to repay the loan, and the banks for extending these loans to them.
Banks who extend bad loans should be able to go bankrupt, but they can't nowadays, because they are too big to fail. Now, because of this, *all* of the blame is put on the Greek people, while they only deserve half. (In fact, I would argue that a lot of them deserve none, since they were in no way responsible for this mess as they were still kids or teenagers back when the loans were extended.)
@_date: 2015-07-14 14:11:15

In the middle of 1 and unlimited transactions per ten minutes. Gotcha ;) (We are somewhere in the middle already, by the way.)


Yeah I disagree. First priority is to keep the network safe, which we can only do if the miners are able to maximise their profits somehow. EVEN if (if!) that means that an on-chain transaction is more expensive than a creditcard payment.

@_date: 2015-07-22 15:15:42


Not at all.


Yes, because they honestly believe that is the best thing to do.


Yes, because it is to their advantage to make Bitcoin succeed, and they believe this is how to do that.




Yeah, well, that just, like, your opinion man.


Look, even if the Core developers were Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Satan, I don't think picking up a pitchfork is a very constructive approach. Again, if pitchforking and bullying is all we resort to, I think we have a much bigger problem than the block size itself.

So we agree that 1 transaction per 10 minutes is probably too low, and unlimited transactions per 10 minutes certainly too high. How do you suggest we find out what the sweet spot is?


Well except for one entity per 10 minutes of course - the one that is willing to pay the price not to.
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:59:02
Disagreeing is fine and is bound to happen sooner or later with a project like this.
The questions now is how we cope with such a situation. If pitchforking and bullying is all we resort to, I think we have a much bigger problem than the block size itself (and I think, indeed, that we might.)
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:17:50
If anything, a number of people (who are very knowledgeable on the subject, I might add) believe Bitcoin *can't* scale. That's not the same as saying they don't *want* it to. Of course they want it to.
Luckily, however, most of them believe Bitcoin actually *can* scale, albeit mostly through alternative solutions. They are not ready, but they are being worked on.
Lastly, most of them actually do agree than the block size limit might at some point need to be raised. But they do think this would require way more testing than has been done, and an extremely careful approach. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 08:53:16
As far as I can tell Jeff is just "disappointed" because there is a lack of communication about this "policy change". ie. it's not even about the "policy change" itself. (If it even is a policy change; we're just talking about a soft limit here.)
Anyways, whatever you think of the block size limit, I really wished these types of pitchforking war cries would stop.
The people who are responsible for making the sure the code keeps working, are doing what they think is the responsible thing to keep the code working. You may disagree on their choices, which is fine, but not everything is a conspiracy.

It's the first time I've heard about the philanthropists part, but the RedHat part is what I recall as well.
Anyways it's not as if they can tap the Lightning network or sidechains directly to make money on fees, or anything like that.
(If you want a more precise answer I suggest checking out their website, or the Lets Talk Bitcoin episode they were in, or even asking them directly. I don't have time for that myself right now, sorry.)

The people who are responsible for making sure the code keeps working, are doing what they think is the responsible thing to keep the code working. You may disagree on their choices, which is fine, but not everything is a conspiracy.
By all means, go and fund development of a new open source version of Core, or support Bitcoin XT if you must. But please cut it out with the personal attacks.

No mate. First of, that's not the money I'm talking about, and second: you have very simplistic view of how money creation works. Moreover, the fact that you think that's the money I'm talking about suggests you have a limited understanding of the euro crisis. 
Additionally, it seems that you are just repeating the caricature of Greece that the main stream media has been repeating for the past five years, but holds very little ground, and isn't very helpful. 
But unfortunately, I don't have time to further discuss this situation right now, sorry.

I guess that would be a valid reason.


Hm? The debate is highly political with or without real names. (And by the way, I literally only asked "why?". Not trying to do anything here.)
@_date: 2015-07-09 23:25:23
Yes, but I don't think we just want greater than zero. We want *as much as possible*, as that would translate into a chain that is *as secure as possible*. Agreed?
@_date: 2015-07-25 15:51:44
Ok, that's clear.
I think you are completely wrong about that.
But I don't think I can change your mind on the matter (nor do I think you will be able to change mine), so it's probably best that we agree to disagree.
Edit: Let me rephrase. It's clear to me that there are different visions on what Bitcoin is and what it is supposed to be, and become. So from both perspectives, the "other" side is the side that's building an altcoin. They're both Bitcoin of course, just with different priorities emphasized. That's all.

One big difference is that with fiat and gold, it is common practice to keep most of it in the bank, and only a little bit in your personal wallet.
With Bitcoin, I can see that model turning upside down. You store most of your wealth outside the reach of banks, and keep a small amount on Coinbase, Circle and Xapo for daily transactions if you want. Or we use sidechains/Lightning for that.
Another big difference is that bitcoin - as opposed to fiat and gold - allows for verifiable reserves.
Anyways, it would be great if we could do everything we want on-chain for free. But if and as long that is not possible, I don't see why it's such a big deal to do some transactions off-chain.
@_date: 2015-07-24 09:14:25
Yes, sort of. That's good to know, so thanks for sharing.
The total amount of fees collected by the miners is still insignificant, however, and that is what really matters in the context of this debate of course.
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:15:48
Indeed, Bitcoin is still small. Lot of growth potential! :)
@_date: 2015-07-07 23:37:51
I'd say it actually does make grammatical sense, it's just a bit silly to phrase it like that.
@_date: 2015-07-31 20:24:19
I never used the word unfair.
However, there is a difference between a company and a monetary system, as a monetary system is supposed to reflect ALL value within a society, while stocks are just supposed to reflect the value of that specific company.
Therefore, what I will say about Bitcoin's wealth distribution, is that it is *extreme*. And therefore, I predict that most people will consider it *undesirable* as a global currency/digital gold-standard/something like that. 
I'm not sure if I agree with Ryan's solution, but I do agree with the problem he describes, at least to a large extent.

And Greg's reply:
































Mike, my first use of Bitcoin was in 2009.  I wasn't vigorously active
in the Bitcoin community until the beginning of 2011, indeed. But this
is just a couple months after you (E.g. first code available for
BitcoinJ was March 2011-- if you go by forums.bitcoin.org account
times my account was created May 5th 2011 vs yours Dec 14th 2010; less
than five months after yours). I was also working with related systems
long before (E.g. RPOW in 2004). So give me a break, there is no rank
to pull here.
Yet again you've managed to call me a bullshitter and guilty of
"invention" when in fact I'm actually quoting the system's creator
(although without the explicit fallacious argument from authority
style you seem prefer). For someone who seems to base all his
arguments on interpretations of someone's words you sure seem to call
their words lies awfully often:
"Piling every proof-of-work quorum system in the world into one
dataset doesn't scale."
"Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the
size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices."
----  
If you'll note,, the post was Dec 10th 2010 and, presumably, made with
an improved understanding of the implications of the system then
comments made in 2008 before the system was even operational.
(The same message also mentions that smart contracts can be used to
create trustless trade with off-chain systems;  As well, later in that
thread: "it will be much easier if you can freely use all the space
you need without worrying about paying fees for expensive space in
Bitcoin's chain.")
I haven't bothered arguing from old posts in the past because I find
the practice of argument from authority on this subject abhorrent. It
undermines the unique value of Bitcoin to argue based on a single
personal opinion, to do so is to miss the point of Bitcoin in a deep
and fundamental way. And in my opinion what you're doing is actually
much worse: arguing from distortions of random quotations.  But it's
hard to tolerate the continue revision of history from you in silence.
Moreover, I find those arguments with respect Moore's law especially
unconvincing because while I cannot read the mind of people who are
not a part of this discussion and haven't chosen to comment, I've used
the same argument myself and I know what I was thinking when I used it
(and can establish as much, since I'm more verbose I elaborated on
it):  When someone pointed at Bitcoins _global_ broadcast medium and
loudly said that it cannot work because its absurd; and it's very easy
to point out broad scaling behavior about what Bitcoin could achieve
with complete centralization. Once this has been accepted the argument
is _over_ in Bitcoin's favor: Bitcoin's competition has highly
centralized administration and so once someone has accepted Bitcoin
can (in some way) accommodate the worlds transactions, even if that
comes at the cost of 99% of the decentralization, it's clear that
Bitcoin offers something interesting. (And for example, I elaborated
on this in a Wiki edit in Aug 2011,
 -- though I shouldn't need to point this out to you, since it was you
who subsequently erased these words from the page.)








For example, you fought vigorously to get Bitcoin Core off
Bitcoin.org, which would ensure that users were not previously
equipped with a node suitable for operating mining (which then
contributed substantially to the poor usability of solutions like
P2Pool; with 98% of it's install time spent waiting for Bitcoin Core
to sync).
You've (in my view) aggressively advocated increasing the resource
utilization of Bitcoin-- increasing the cost to participate in mining
without delegation, with no consideration (or at least disclosure) of
the ramifications on the system overall:
Gavin, for example, has advocated removing mining support from Bitcoin
core on several occasions; and constantly professes ignorance on
anything mining.  His own interests are up to him, but to not be
concerned about a central part of the system for anyone working on
changing it at such a deep level is-- I think-- a bit problematic.
But I didn't intend to lay blame here, if anything I blame myself for
not being more proactive in arguing against things things in the past.
The trend towards mining centralization is a result of various forces,
many of which are modulated by the very things we're discussing here
(or could be modulated by things we haven't discussed).  You're the
principle advocate of increasing the cost of a decentralized ecosystem
around verification and driving the system towards a state where it is
only viable in a more centralized mode.  Bitcoin is an artificial
construction, not a force of nature, and when someone seeks to change
it they ought to take responsibility for what happens--- it's not
acceptable to say "oh well, it's not eh fault of anyone" when the
incentives drive it in a bad direction.
Is that your strategy on the systems resource consumption in general?
Full throttle, no action when it goes off the rails,  when the easily
foreseeable negative outcomes happen it won't be the "fault" of
anyone? If so, I don't think that is acceptable. We need to face the
areas in which the system is failing, now and in the future... and not
just pump for growth at all cost and shrug and say "oh well, we tried"
when the predictable failure happens. It's far from clear to me that
the world will get a second shot at this in the next several decades
if Bitcoin lapses into the same-old, same-old.








The fixation comment was a specific reply to your long list of the
"only reasons" to run a full node, which seemed to be basically said
that the only reason to run one was to act as a server for SPV
clients; as it listed several points on that-- all three of the
numbered points were "serving SPV wallets"-- and buried the rest.  I'm
sorry if I read too much into it, though it's also consistent with
your prior responses that the non-scalability of Bitcoin as a whole is
irrelevant due to SPV.
I don't think there is anything fundamentally bad with SPV, it is what
it is; it's a tool and an important one. But at the moment it is far
more limited than you give it credit for both because it is only
secure under certain assumptions which have been provably violated not
just at risk of violation, and because the more complete vision of it
(e.g. with fraud proofs) has never been implemented.






















Now that I've established the "small device" text you're railing on
here actually came from the system's creator prior to your
involvement, can I expect an admission that your own "personal liking"
doesn't have special authority over the system?  But I hope you don't
create an altcoin: I think it's possible to find ways to accommodate
people with very different preferences under one tent, and if we are
to build and support a worldwide system we _must_ find those ways
rather than fragmenting the marketplace.

The exact same thing could be said about raising the block size limit of course.

Blockstream is a company that was founded by and hired a couple of Bitcoin's Core developers. It is working on two very innovative open source extensions for the Bitcoin blockchain: sidechains and the lightning network.
Sidechains you understand.
The lightning network will allow for many transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain to be fit into one single transaction. Most importantly, this could drastically increase the number of transactions that the Bitcoin blockchain can handle.
Another way to increase the number of possible transactions the Bitcoin network can handle would be to raise the block size limit. But according to many developers (including, but not limited to the Blockstream team), this is not a good idea for a number of reasons.
But according to some - especially here on reddit it seems - Blockstream is in reality just opposing an increase of the block size limit in order to "force"* people to use the lightning network.
Personally, I think it's the other way around. The Blockstream guys saw a real problem, so they set out to solve it through their company.
But who knows?
*No one is litereally being forced, but it would be the cheapest solution.

Yes, all of the Core devs (safe for one) are clearly trolls.

@_date: 2015-07-08 21:41:36

Sooner or later there will need to be a fee market though, wouldn't you agree?
@_date: 2015-07-27 18:15:43
I would argue that the Greek debt crisis showed otherwise. If not for the steady rise in bitcoin's price while the situation was heating up*, then surely for the sudden drop when it was "resolved".
The market was clearly using bitcoin as a hedge.
*That's not even taking into account that the rise is price was probably due to the Chinese stock market crashing as well.
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:54:58
Go for it.
@_date: 2016-02-28 10:04:16
That's nice of him. Did he also apologize for saying the Core devs should be fired?
@_date: 2015-07-26 20:34:12
No, not being purposely obtuse.
FWIW, here's where I think you are wrong: it's not that the people who tend to want to keep the block size limit smaller don't *want* Bitcoin to scale. It's that they think Bitcoin *can't* scale. Or at the very least not without greatly centralizing the whole thing.
This also makes that I think you have the whole Blockstream argument upside down. They are not limiting Bitcoin so that their Lighting network is conveniently needed. They think the Lightning network is needed because Bitcoin can't scale. They are actually building a solution for a problem.
So if we're talking about the two "altcoin" versions of Bitcoin, the choice really is:
a) A Bitcoin that allows for many cheap transactions on-chain, but that could end up centralized, hence opening the door for blacklists and these sorts of things.
b) A Bitcoin that is decentralized and uncersorable, but that can't process all transactions on the blockchain for (near-)zero fees.

I personally think we should take care of the poor ourselves *first*, before we even talk about subverting the state. Not the other way round and hope for the best.
