Edit: Actually I think I can just call bs now. FDIC insurance is calculated based on how many account owners there are, not the individual accounts. A joint bank account with no beneficiaries would have $200,000 of coverage at that time, plus IRAs had $250,000 of coverage back then and are calculated separately.

None. The FDIC is chartered by the government but it manages its insurance coverage by charging premiums on the banks. It has the ~~implicit~~ explicit support of the government if it was going to go under, but that's unlikely.

Not the point I was making but, yes, TARP is a taxpayer funded program. It injected capital into the banking system during a financial crisis to improve liquidity and confidence in the banking system. It was questionably managed and certainly could have benefited from more oversight and restrictions but ended up being a net positive including making billions of dollars on the banks for the taxpayer.  
The FDIC didn't help the large banks buy their smaller competitors. These banks had failed; they were no longer competitors. The FDIC pulls the plug and places them in conservatorship. Faced with the option of selling off the assets and paying the insured depositors or letting another bank assume the operations in exchange for a loss sharing agreement isn't an option. The effect on the depositors in an FDIC assisted bank transaction is minor and the FDIC's fund doesn't take as big a hit.
