@_date: 2019-07-07 05:56:06
we wish.
@_date: 2019-07-06 12:39:49
it's not waste and mining must be as inefficient as possible.
@_date: 2019-07-04 12:42:41
if your wallet was actually compromised then by the time you find out and broadcast your transactions it'll be gone.
@_date: 2019-07-14 10:19:55
because you bought
@_date: 2019-07-21 08:48:03
only losers get pissed off

even distribution doesn't exist, and it won't. Bitcoin will be in the hands of people who had luck, skill, grit, patience, and foresight, to hodl through. If you think you qualify, prove it by buying and hodling.
@_date: 2019-07-07 03:08:10
are you from 2017
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:16:39

@_date: 2019-07-21 11:28:45
no. inflation is fee on everyone, transaction fee is fee on blockspace user. why do people not transacting should pay for people transacting?
@_date: 2019-07-09 10:41:17
is that all you could come up with for how to make money online?
@_date: 2019-07-02 10:18:21
no need for apologies. there are many people who mine as a hobby too. just don't expect a profit.
on the other hand if you can get a free electricity in a student dorm or something then you might actually have a chance. still need to be able to do calculations though.
@_date: 2019-07-29 09:35:41

it's taxable event. do it anonymously with non-kyc exchange.
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:38:25
you know you deserved the loss and still looking to invest?
seems you deserve another loss.
@_date: 2019-07-22 11:16:41
no. you're wrong in like 3 layers.
@_date: 2019-07-13 06:11:00

@_date: 2019-07-08 23:34:07
you have access to the fucking internet.
@_date: 2019-07-24 12:14:01
why can't people just buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-01 13:15:28
I suppose he's fucked then. or sim swap attack.
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:51:14
yea sure fuck off.
@_date: 2019-07-04 12:58:00
and then the attacker create new transactions with higher fees? or the initial transaction had higher fees from the beginning? 
it doesn't add risk but I don't really think presigned transaction adds any more security. if attacker has the key and you don't it's game over.
in case of just suspect you can just carry the key with plausible deniability.
@_date: 2019-07-04 07:55:46
nice try IRS
@_date: 2019-07-21 01:57:22
quite many people actually do this. first time I had a chance it was $3, I even made accounts in two exchanges but never bought. I bought back at ATH and still in red but now I'm past resentment.
@_date: 2019-07-02 02:44:20
for what and to what size? btc had block size increased to 4mb already almost 2 years ago. Past discussions are everywhere on YouTube.
@_date: 2019-07-01 13:16:50

@_date: 2019-07-21 09:11:37
start with "right" and end with "you don't understand"? you're the one writing an essay on reddit complaining such a small price move...
@_date: 2019-07-23 10:53:01
because last one to enter still benefits from sound money.
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:13:59
some services offer 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 multisig, where you can ask the company to hold some of your keys in case you lose yours. Or you can create keys with different privilege, e.g. transactions with key A always takes 30 days and key B can cancel it anytime. I also heard some people are working on deadman's switch. bitcoin is programmable so you can pretty much set up anything. You need to think what fits your needs the most.
just remember you're much more likely to fuck up key management yourself than keys get stolen by hackers.
@_date: 2019-07-09 12:37:31
it was you
@_date: 2019-07-29 11:49:29

you're on a track to be richer than 95% of the people in the world, but never ever fucking tell anyone how much bitcoin you own especially on the internet. you already own enough for someone to kill you if they find out in the future.

@_date: 2019-03-13 07:52:12
no. worth case failure in LN can delay the BTC adoption but BTC will be just fine with or without LN. 
@_date: 2019-11-17 04:50:50
use hardware wallet and verify there before sending
@_date: 2019-11-23 21:16:12
and pay the transaction fees for the 1sat. repeat till drain the funds.

@_date: 2017-08-13 10:59:10
"what do you want to sell for btc?"  or "at a fair market price, sure!" would be my response.

Of course not. Nothing is 100% secure. But it's more secure than everything else at least for now.

@_date: 2017-08-22 10:22:01
70% in btc. Still never borrow or invest more than you can afford to lose. I put most of my savings, but if btc goes to zero I can still not die with my poor salary, and I don't have anyone that I need to take care of. Little sad about the last part but because of this I can put quite a portion in btc so I guess it's ok. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 02:16:55
hence, bulltrap. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:22:40
I know. I'm saying it should be from 50k moon to 1m.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:37:15
Yes, so for store of value purposes it works perfectly. But as a medium of exchange, it's pretty useless to spend $7 for every transaction. That's why we'll get lightning network.

Usually when people like you start asking questions like this it's a little too late. Start looking for next opportunities. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:54:46
They can pump the stock market I'm sure they can do with bitcoin too especially to damage the network. And introduce a fiat blockchain backed by government miners for superficial stability and people with short vision will be tricked... 
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:29:49
And the angle is the direction of future price 
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:35:56
And they still sell the dog shit CLO and banks are leveraging like there's no tomorrow... Maybe they know we don't have tomorrow. I sincerely hope we don't run into WW3...
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:36:11
We're in thr middle of dealing with the scaling solution. We'll have segwit soon, and following lightning network, and future atomic swap. Those should bring the fees down for a while until next scaling solution is needed. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:32:22
And me. And everyone else. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 07:29:02
Is this for the main street too, or just for more professional money managers? Can any individuals trade this? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:03:53
No. The price you sell is the market price.

basically there're only three good choices. Ledger, Trezor, or Coldcard. Coldcard has best security but too difficult for newbie. Ledger has nice UI. Trezor is also relatively easy. this is more like a preference so just google prices and see couple videos.
I'd go with Ledger Nano S first. there's new X version but it's a little more expensive.

@_date: 2019-01-19 11:42:24
it's from Luke-jr on twitter. and no it's not nonsense. segwit is a block size increase and bigger block hurts the network.

Because of the supply cap, it'll be more difficult for criminals to stay dominant. With current fiat systems, the criminals with money can print money or lobby for profit, meaning they can buy more money with money. I forgot the numbers but how much the top 1% today control is a lot worse than you think. With bitcoin, the 1% don't have the control and power to buy more money with money. So in the beginning the criminals may have great number of bitcoin in control, but that number will decrease if they don't serve the interest of people.

@_date: 2017-10-19 16:41:34
To me it's about how much I don't trust fiat rather than how much I trust bitcoin. It's a risk to hold fiat based asset and there's very few other options. So I put 60% in btc, 10% in ltc, 10% in silver. Rest of 20% is for daily life.

Miners are businesses and nodes are consumers. It is absolutely correct that miners take more risks, but it's the consumer's choice whether to buy the business's product, which are blocks they produce in bitcoin. As soon as business owners think that business controls consumers, their business is over. That's where Vinny's misunderstanding is.

no reason, except satoshi made it so. It's a result of blocktime, block rewards, and halving policy. the actual number doesn't mean anything, and it's not even exactly 21 million either.

I'm thinking of creating bitcoin fork that inflates the supply constantly on debt-issuing basis and see how many people will follow. Initially backed by bitcoin but when adopted enough take out the backing, and just let it be. Bitcoin Fiat.

Japan and Swiss is going all in. Some more countries seeing it positive. Some countries need btc to survive. Some trying to ban or strictly regulate. Not sure about recent prominent news source but couple times in the front page of quite several news papers. At this point most of the population at least have heard of bitcoin. Not surprising some got interested and start asking friends.

It's not "from btc". It's from private keys. You can't buy btc and claim bch. If you own some private keys with btc that you haven't moved since before the time of fork, then yes there are plenty of safe ways.

that sounds very strange... blockchain info is one of the worst wallet and if I remember correctly it has a history of poor entropy sources. maybe there was some flaw in key generation and someone else accidentally got your key? still very strange someone send money to wallet that someone else has control too.

Those 4% are the tech-savvy genius guys smart enough to understand bitcoin in its infancy. Much better than the petro-dollar based war-loving bankstars which are the current top 4%.

Assume everything is a scam unless otherwise proven. Is there any reason why you think it could be legit? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:59:58
Yea i know only 8% nothing to be surprised right?

and? someone is richest at all time. if they can't produce to earn bitcoin they'll lose sooner or later.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:05:19
Nah he's domb.
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:42:13
The time they prefer bitcoin is when fiat dies.

That was just an example... you can mix with different language and do more complex encryption two or three times make it look like a random poem from exotic country then I think it's secure enough.

I alter my seeds on some simple rules like shift by 3 (a-&gt;d) that you can memorize but complex enough that other people can't guess and send it to my email. You just need to remember what rule you used to decrypt.

If sell at 3100 is a choice for you then you still have a lot more to dream 
@_date: 2017-07-04 17:45:20
Real seed words don't have to be the only seed words in encryption... just write a 500 word essay and put real seed words in location starting with your favorite Fibonacci sequence and still will be hard enough to crack but easy enough to remember.
Just be more creative...

Politics and economics are a little more complicated than you think. If the government decided to bail in the banks, then there will be dollar shortages and the value of dollar goes up temporarily until people decide to leave the dollar systems. Also in the time of economic crisis in this scale, the broker you used to short  the dollar index might fail too. We chose bitcoin because there's virtually no counterparty risk. Even if there was no counterparty risk, the profit on the short would be in dollars because there's no broker that provides bitcoin based payout (business chance here!) Payment in dollar, which we have no faith in and trying to escape from, is not attractive at all. 
In short : No thanks 
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:11:58
I think we're still far from it. The then they fight phase is yet to come with much, much bigger power so we better prepare ourselves.

I can buy gold and silver with bitcoin so I'm ok with this.
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:37:34
I don't know about US law but just got curious. So do the customers must prove the money was acquired legally, not the government has to prove it's acquired illegally?

either they meant the opendime, or via satellite. internet isn't required but connection to other nodes that is connected to internet is required.

Recommend to watch. Seems they have limited knowledge about cryptos but still they're very keen about what to expect in the process to next financial system.
@_date: 2017-07-15 20:05:17
Lazy to do tax stuff and hate fiat so much I don't want it at any price.

you can't diversify shit buying shitcoins. 90% bitcoin, 10% gold.

@_date: 2019-05-17 07:25:14
you can use any wallet that supports the seeds. doesn't have to be the one ypu used before. just don't give the seeds to anyone or any website.
@_date: 2019-05-17 07:51:26
yes. but if you're unsure just try with very small amount so you can make sure it's right.
@_date: 2017-07-24 03:54:36
It's legit and nobody is preventing you from arbitrage.

I'm a newcomer but didn't know bitcoin was this sensitive to politicians' comments... The end of fiat feels very close....

that'll be in the middle of bear market crashing to 30k from 200k.
@_date: 2019-05-06 06:56:29
you're probably missing quite some amount of background knowledge. keep studying and somewhere down the line it'll "click" and you'll understand the inevitability
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:32:57
but jesus you're rich.
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:29:54
Great. You can also watch all videos from Andreas Antonopoulos. Fabulous youtube clips most of them targeted for non technical people. He sometimes mixes the economic reality and immediate human behaviors so it's a little misleading sometimes but Saifedean's book should straight up that part. Good luck.
@_date: 2019-05-29 08:11:27

they don't. they compete with casino.

How the hell are you trusting a closed source software?
Also it's probably you let your key to leak somehow rather than exodus's fault

you've been posting same thing over and over again pretending it's different content. Scammer title granted.
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:03:28
I don't know what you mean by closed market but people are adopting to bitcoin at explosive rate especially this year. Sooner than we think we'll be able to just spend bitcoin to live without too much hustle.
But why would you want bank crypto...?
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:56:48
bitcoin is a very fine choice for that. gotta protect.

Welcome! make sure you try with small amounts like $20 or so and play around until comfortable so you don't mess up later. Also never ever tell anyone how much money you own ever again.
@_date: 2019-05-30 11:25:02
I only have nano S but it's really nice and simple. Make sure you never touch anything other than bitcoin. Everything else is garbage and won't last 5 years so they'll all be worthless by the time you pass on.
@_date: 2019-05-30 11:18:00
buy a ledger or coldcard, watch all videos from Andreas Antonopoulos, play around with small amounts like $20 until you know what you are doing, and buy however much you want to gift and hodl.

It's fantastic but what up with Japan's rush? Make me think they too are scared of fiat now.
@_date: 2019-05-19 11:03:04
just checked the linked thread, but the poster clearly has no idea what he's talking about. don't bother. if you want to learn about bitcoin watch all videos by Andreas Antonopoulos.

I bought my bitcoin as an insurance. 1 btc for $3000 is like $50 per month insurance against global financial crisis within next 5 years.
@_date: 2019-05-04 12:27:15
how? if tether blow up bitfinex will have trouble paying back the fiat. have you not noticed the premium?
@_date: 2019-05-04 12:55:47
Clearly you put your money into something you have no idea. Sooner or later you'll lose it all anyways.
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:58:13
Apprpriate fee is determined by the market. Also bitcoin transaction fees are still lower than fiat industry standard.
@_date: 2017-06-19 04:44:05
Are you from the past?
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:16:27
Lol if people are in bitcoin business what do they need banks for
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:31:42
I think you're confusing the price and inflation. When bitcoin price goes from $300 to $3000, what's inflating is USD value, since you need more USD to buy 1 bitcoin. The value of USD is decreasing, hence inflation. The bitcoin on the other hand is going deflation, since you can get more USD with same 1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:44:05
Congrats and study well!
@_date: 2017-06-19 04:41:29
As Andreas said somewhere, your investment should equal your technical understanding of crypto you're buying.
If you understand 100% (hint: you'll never get there, but try to have a very good understanding at least), you pretty much can't stop yourself from buying as much as possible. If you don't understand what it is, then do your homework first.
@_date: 2019-05-04 12:02:52
crash? if anything people will escape into btc and push up the price.
@_date: 2019-05-12 02:40:58

Oh I guess I missed the obvious!
But then we'll end up with two chains with segwit, one from UASF and one from Jihan correct? And since Jihan-chain bitcoin will have some period of time under pretty much total control of Jihan, can't he implement anything, like a backdoor access during this period?
@_date: 2019-05-26 07:38:54
you've been fed so much misinformation...

that's just literal translation of Chinese characters that would've been used if it were Japanese name
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:40:33
I'm sure you can use bitcoin for any transactions if both sides agree.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:42:59
It's a term for people not selling bitcoin. The thing is those people won't sell bitcoin. They're waiting the world to adopt to bitcoin so they can spend it without converting back to fiat. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:36:22
So if humanity's technology advanced enough that we can spend sun's entire lifetime energy like a tissue paper, then we should start worrying about this issue. Even just writing this comment feels weird!
@_date: 2019-05-09 10:05:02

I really want to do this, but I don't want fiat so much that I don't want to sell at any price.
@_date: 2017-06-24 08:42:39
They earn bitcoin. They didn't buy low to sell higher.

@_date: 2017-06-20 16:27:18
I'm sure there are, but most people who has 7.5 btc now are probably the people who bought btc for long term. Those hodlers probably won't trade their btc for a car. I'm just saying it's probably easier to change for fiat and then get btc...
@_date: 2019-05-17 05:36:04

Centralized system is more efficient, but if it's ran by human it simply doesn't serve the 99%. We as a 99% want a financial system that works without trusting anyone, and decentralization gives us the way. I think the key is trust less system, not the decentralization. If we can do centralized system without trust that would be perfect but I can't think of any possible way.
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:41:19
