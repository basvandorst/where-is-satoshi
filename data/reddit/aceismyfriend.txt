Exactly. I do expect a small dump on Sunday/Monday after CBOE future go live just because of uncertainty but on the long run futures are definitely a good think and with CME futures around the corner the value will skyrocket.

I don't see any contradiction, I do see a money transfer system that is unforgiving in terms of making mistakes. People make mistakes and blame it on marketplaces.

So far there is a direct correlation between the increases in bitcoin and the amount of publicity in the media and by the looks of things it will shoot up in the days to come:
1. Bitcoin about to break the 12,000$ mark which means more publicity
2. Bitcoin about to break the 10,000 euro mark which means more publicity
3. Bitcoin about to break the 200,000,000$ market cap which means more publicity
4. CBOE Futures about to go live which will most definitely mean an increase in the coming 7-14 days plus all the added publicity
5. CME Futures only 2 weeks away which will cause even more publicity
6. NASDAQ Futures coming
7. More countries are legalising bitcoin
8. Bitcoin going viral in South Korea &amp; Japan
9. China on the verge of lifting a ban on cryptocurrencies
10. Bitcoin to the moon if you consider that this is just the beginning

The email didn't come from the mentioned email address, it's the address where scammers ask you to send an email to. I can tell these guys aren't hackers, they are ordinary scammers.

What happened is the very reason why people are switching to BTC. The system to transfer money between banks is flawed. If a few characters are wrong then the money could be frozen for days or sometimes weeks before being sent back.

None of them will. You always need to provide Ids etc for verification. Kraken is ok but also requires verification.

I don't trust Kraken anymore, there is definitely something fishy going on whenever I try to trade bitcoins. I always end up getting screwed over by 1-3%

Wow, $168,69. So generous. I hope they hodl on to that $171,42.

After people realise that for each whale shorting bitcoin there will be another whale doing the opposite (that's how futures work) and since none of CBOE/CME will actually buy bitcoins it will have little effect on the market but to create more publicity and confidence.

No doubt but I think Bitcoin because of it's scale, is less prone to manipulation. Coins like NEO are much more risky.

It will crash and fork many more times but I wouldn't be surprised if BTC will be at $20k+ in 6 months from now when bigger companies start adopting bitcoin. You can quote me on this.

Word of advice  check your Reddit account activity page. Chances are high if you're active on this SUV that your account is already compromised. See a suspicious IP? Change your password.
Word of advice  check if your password isn't compromised on haveibeenpwned.com, if it has then make sure you change your password and use something that is hard to guess. 
Word of advice  enable 2 factor authentication wherever possible. Google Authenticator is a good app/service.
Word of advice  don't publicly brag about how much you made, hackers are watching you.
Word of advice  be careful with installing crypto currency apps, app users are a great lead for hackers and app developers are targets of hackers (delta etc)
I estimate there will be an unprecedented attack on crypto currency holders so be well prepared.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:41:59
This is no longer a "correction" and all signs indicate that Bitcoin will continue to drop as investors are fed up with the drama around bitcoin, the queues and the ever-increasing fees. 
Disclaimer: I currently don't own any cryptocurrency (only 9 euro worth of btc on coinbase to get accustomed) but weighing up a move to bitcoin, not looking to skew any results but just a realist. People's unconditional faith in BTC will be their demise.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:51:36
It's good to hit 8,000 again. It means all websites will talk about BTC again and more publicity = higher demand. It's a good time to buy more BTC as long as it has momentum.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:23:19
BTC will hit 10K+ by the end of the year
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:45:01
Guys be careful publicly stating how many bitcoins you have. I can tell you hackers are watching you as you speak and if you are using a password that previously leaked (didigetpwned.com) then chances are good hackers are already having into your Reddit account (keep an eye on your account activity).
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:56:42

@_date: 2017-11-20 18:04:03
Actually, I think it is still really low and waiting for it to correct to a value of about 20,000+ $ after it reaches it's full potential (lower costs, bigger block size and higher adoption rate e.g. Amazon, Ebay, etc).
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:57:18
There is some ridiculously good news coming up in the next 2 weeks, I think 15k is definitely possible by the end of the year (CME futures will take BTC to the moon)
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:17:40
I'm super confident btc will go up significantly in the coming week, there is absolutely no reason why it would dip again. Unless some attack or failed fork will happen but probably not for a while. People who trade in BTC are also becoming more mature as they realise BTC will always make it's way back up after a dip and speculating is often more risky.

@_date: 2017-11-20 18:14:24
I disagree, right now BTC is a sound investment. Growth over the past weeks is organic and won't suddenly disappear and if it does, it will recover again. It's not much of a currency I agree but that will change over time.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:28:49

Bitcoin will prosper in times of chaos. Stock markets crash, money devaluates and people will look at crypto currency for keeping their savings.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:06:12
At this rate, 10k is absolutely possible with the occasional dip. If only Amazon adopts BTC it would be an interesting XMAS gift over Amazon gift cards.

@_date: 2017-11-19 20:22:48
Lots of websites will be talking about BTC reaching 8,000 and an ATH tomorrow, this will cause more people who were previously on the fence to buy BTC and will drive up the price in the coming days. Also banks don't process transfer on the weekends so shortly after the weekend is often an additional bump. There is still a chance for a small dip as people set beforehand but no real reasons for BTC to drop. Also people will be more confident in BTC as it always seems to recover from dips and make its' way back up, this will attract serious investors.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:48:10
Happened to me before. Make sure you don't:
1. Appear on didigetpwned.com
2. Use that same password on reddit
3. Publicly brag about how many bitcoins you have
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:26:00
Because Bitcoin will not continue to increase in value forever. I expect Bitcoin to reach about 15k at the end of the year (yes in about a month from now it will have doubled due to CME futures and other banks/firms joining in) and then continue to grow for at least 1 more year before it hits the ceiling. By then BTC is nowhere near as volatile as it is now and the value will be much more stable.
