I really like this. All the news of lost or stolen BTC something like this will flourish. Possibly even integrating a "safe-send" for verified merchants. If BTC is sent to a verified merchant (much like twitter verified accounts) then the transaction could take place immediately if the merchant agrees to a refund policy if a claim is filed within the 24 hour period. That way users have the ability to send coins instantly to get their product/service while still being decentralized for the user. Only the merchant would be known. Just a thought, I'm sure there are holes and problems with my extension on this idea. Still though, I'll be looking into using TrustedCoin. Kudos!

That's awesome! I live a couple blocks away and never noticed.

The limit is removed once ID is provided or you've been a user on Coinbase for a while (if I remember correctly)

Ah. Well I'm not sure about an existing outage. I'm sure it will be resolved soon. I have noticed their desktop site seems to be updated more regularly than the app. So if you are in a hurry I'd definitely keep a tab open to their desktop site as that probably will be fixed first.

True. I've noticed over the years bitcoin news stories almost always give the wrong idea. Way back to when it was called "hacker money" when the silk road was a big thing.

Coinbase also has an app that does this. And if you are holding any coins with them it will show you the conversion for the exact amount you have.

It will never be banned here in the US. It violates no laws. Basically if BTC is banned they'd need to ban several other things, such as the American dream.
As for buying a ton themselves, a few years ago when they shut down the silk road and seized the owners wallet, they ended up auctioning off the coins in bulk (I believe several hundred thousand coins). So I don't see the government buying coins on their own for a while at least.

This is taken so far out of context...

Couldn't have said it better myself.

If being a bitcoin holder has taught me anything. It's never, ever, ever panic sell. The price has always recovered. Call me an optimist but I see nothing but a bright future.

It was made as a currency. And currencies are taxed. Just because the IRS classifies it as a property just means we pay less tax on it. It is entirely decentralized, no argument there from me. I'm saying if we don't hold BTC to the same currency standards, then essentially it will be seen as a decentralized "Cayman Islands" where money goes to evade taxation.
I agree I am not happy it's being taxed, but I see how it is needed to be adopted by any business.

If you didn't zero out your hard drive you can possibly get an expert to retrieve files that may still be on the HDD. It's a long shot but depending on the amount of BTC you had it might be worth it.

When will the "bubble" term stop popping up in all the headlines. This has been going on for years now and am honestly curious why. I understand it fluctuates in value. But the world hasn't seen technology like this before and we are inventing a new way of trading. We can't go by the current stock trading rules. New things don't necessarily mean "bubble". And it's not like BTC is brand new either. Anyone have any thoughts?

Bitcoin wasn't made for tax evasion. It's subject to every law USD is under. And things like this help legitimize the currency.

Worrying is a natural part of the Bitcoin lifestyle. Just know the price will always fluctuate. The only diference is it is a lot steeper than standard stock trading.
