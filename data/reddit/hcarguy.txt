Coinbase are fucking shit, honestly. They locked my account for a few days for "security". Missed out on cheap ICX. Fuckers. You guys definitely have it worse though.... but it's enough to show how shit of a company they are.

At least it lasts for longer than beauty. One of the consolations of being male. 18-25 might suck, but once you start investing in yourself once you hit 30 you can have the entire market
@_date: 2018-09-28 09:21:04
I honestly hope it doesn't. It will make crypto look less credible if it's predicted that returns will always come in the end of the year, just because it's the end of the year.

Lol, just goes to show how much you know about crypto.

It's really dumb to think that btc is invincible. The fact that it is affected so much by news and speculation is proof that it is actually quite delicate.

@_date: 2017-11-04 02:36:14
Well he's right. Right now it's extremely overvalued and it's value is based on speculative interest. I wouldn't say "dont buy BTC" though. This is just not the right time to buy. Buy after it crashes. I think it'll come down to 2.5-3k usd per btc.
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:02:06
Because transaction volume, time, and cost hasn't changed significantly over the past few months (not including the volume when it comes to actual trading). I'm referring to it's use as what it was originally intended for. The technology hasn't advanced at a similar rate to the price, and the increased adoption is only from people who are buying as an investment.
I've seen a lot of hype in the media, from different institutions/ important people bringing attention to BTC. It just seems to me like everyone is jumping on the "hodl to the moon" bandwagon because of the hype and attention. 
Although that's really a subjective and qualitative analysis of the price, like in the video the guy points out that BTC has had several bull runs in the past, which is always followed by a price correction in the short term. I think it will happen again soon. Overall, I do see the price going up long term (next 1-2 yrs), but this sort of growth looks unsustainable short term. When mid Nov rolls around with the S2x fork I'll have a better idea of what might happen, if my theory is true or if I'm wrong and it's going to keep climbing. 
What are your thoughts on it?

Though petrol prices go through a very predictable 20-30 day cycle at the pumps, at least here in Australia anyway. Wish the same could be said about BTC, I'd be buying like a mad man
@_date: 2017-09-24 02:16:53
I agree. I used to worry, now the only thing I'm worried about is making myself wealthy so I don't have these problems. Great thing is that Bitcoin will help change the world for the better in the process
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:34:11
Yeah, I mean it's to be expected when it's the biggest cryptocurrency. Scaling problems come with more users
@_date: 2017-09-24 02:25:15
Rather than fighting the guys who are talking shit, and praising the guys who aren't... why do we care? Chaos is a ladder. It enables us to get more while the price is low. Speaking as someone who has zero money because of college, I need a bit more time to grab a hold of some...

the guys who fucked it, yeah sure. but they people who lost everything were regular people like you and me. they lost homes, jobs, savings, pensions. all because these bankers fucked them there was a guy called howie hubler who lost $9 billion for a firm, didn't go to jail and got paid $10 million severance pay.

even though defaults on loans were going up, the price of bonds and insurance covering those bonds stayed the same. they were manipulating the value of these items, where the things they were built on (mortgages) were failing at incredibly high rates
decent video to explain this i guess. the actual movie is fucking fantastic though, i definitely recommend you watch it. highly entertaining also

I'm 100% certain Dimon is putting a few mil into crypto but just talking shit about it so he keeps face for his real job. In 10 years, either way he comes out on top

I think it's more of a commodity at the moment, like gold. Once it reaches critical mass then it will be a currency.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:58:56
Bitcoin has problems right now with scaling (so transaction fees and speed). It can be expected of any crypto with so many users. Eth is also beginning to have scaling issues.
Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin created by Roger Ver, Jihan Wu and friends. It's trying to capitalise on Bitcoin's struggles by using it's name and attacking the original Bitcoin. It is *not* Bitcoin. It's an imitation that is centralized and controlled by a few people, which is exactly the opposite of what you want in a global decentralized currency (ahem, remind you of anything? Fiat currency and governments.).
Roger Ver and co are just simply trying to get massively rich. They don't give a fuck about crypto or the philosophy that Satoshi Nakamoto had in mind, regardless of how much they say "it's more aligned with the original vision". 
Anyway, this is my opinon. I really fucking hate BCH fanboys who attack BTC, and vice versa. Crypto is an *ecosystem*, we should be working together to allow it to flourish. NOT attacking each other, that's when corrupt banks and governments win.

Hehe more for us then

yeah i think a few of the banks have teams working on crypto/ blockchain. im not exactly sure what theyre doing but it seems like theyre using the tech for payments rather than pure investment/ developing their own coin

what they were doing contributed heavily to the GFC in 08, they knew but didnt care as they were making a shit tonne of money
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:25:14
Venezuela, Belarus, GFC '08, plenty of examples where it doesn't work. Look, I agree with you for the most part, but that banks amd governments are run by people. People get greedy and can be stupid, that's why it inherently isn't perfect. I'd rather rely on a system that's 100% perfect than 99.1% perfect.
@_date: 2017-09-23 02:11:16
all the stuff that lead to the GFC in 08. they knew what they were doing was wrong, but did it because they were making so much money. banks lent money to people who couldnt afford to pay it back, and these subprime loans were put into mortgage bonds which were sold as high quality investments, as everyone thought that real estate was rock solid. insurance on these bonds were also sold, which were obviously unstable due to the fact it was based around sub prime loans.
it went on until they made billions, and many people didnt realise what was coming until it happened. but the guys who were running the show knew. we all know how devastating it was for everyone. loss of jobs, homes, life savings etc
im not in finance or have a background in finance, but thats my basic understanding of what happened
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:03:22
Or even weeks at a time, really. (Well ok look, but only to check what's going on!)

The market is absolutely fucked right now. I think it's funny that people are panicking (I know, I'm a dick). OP, do not get emotional and pull out right now. The market will stabilise over the next 3-4 months.

People were saying how awesome Ver is, but now the tune is completely different. Can you explain why?
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:56:27
that wasnt the crime, that was careless. the crime was fraudulently manipulating the system to profit, rather than to correct the mistake
