Wait!  The price is dropping.

I love the site and love the idea!  I hope you do well.

On Dreamwords.com, your very last line of "The Journal" description should read "links even as an army of lost souls closes around him"

I hope we can fix it for you, too.

I sold at $811, one bitcoin.  Never got the money, so today they sent me 1 bitcoin worth $550 now.
Since I saw your post,  I went back and asked that they should have given me about 1.45 bitcoin, not just 1.
Will let you know what happens.

They must be using MTGOX for pricing when selling you a coin and then they use greed to buy your coin at half the price of the "Buy"

He has a rating of 6 and has never sold anything.
Really dodgy
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:34:26
How much did you pay for each BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:24:14
Right now you can buy at 139.99 .  Guess they dont want anyone to buy.
Of course, 2 days ago people would have been begging for this price.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:39:24
Sell is at $114 now. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:03:00
Ok, I can get to it now
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:42:04
Yes, and the GOX lag just caused people to sell even an HOUR after the selling should have stopped!

What's with the 'tude?  I'm just saying the same thing happened to me.

I had added the phone authentication and was worried that had messed it up.
Glad to hear it isn't on my side.
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:25:18
Thanks,  It was under the History tab
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:45:59
I hate this.  Can't they stop that?
@_date: 2013-04-19 15:39:48
The brothers only had about 90K coins, I believe. supposedly 1% of coins
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:34:30
That would be awesome!
@_date: 2013-04-07 21:34:35
One person is "strong" support?
@_date: 2013-04-21 14:36:40
Yeah, just noticed it was down.  Thanks
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:22:59
I believe you get it at the sell price Coinbase states.  They will give you the sell price. It can be several or many dollars less than the current buy price. Tv his morning the buy price was $199.99 and the sell price was $104. That is the biggest difference I have seen on their site.
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:42:19
They have done this to a lot of folks, me included.  What good are they if they don't buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:57:27
It means its slowa machines are too slow and can't handle all the orders.  It also means that you would be ordering Bitcoins without any idea as to how much they would cost if you bought them during the lag.
@_date: 2013-05-11 01:53:01
I just got a response from them.
They were paused while they performed maintenance.
They responded real quick.
@_date: 2013-12-20 03:21:55
I see your point.  I have used them for almost a year.  No problem til last week. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:29:15
Buy at 199.90 and sell for 141 or so.  Hmmm, making any money here?
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:04:24
Try around 3 pm Pacific time to 5 pm pacific time
I have my luck around those times usually.  Daily
