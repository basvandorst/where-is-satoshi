Are proven investments still relevant today? What industries aren't either being, or about to be, shaken up by new technology?
I don't know much about investing (trying to learn) but I get the impression that this approach might be outdated.

Think about all the money invested in cryptocurrency though. If all that was invested in only bitcoin it would be worth a lot more. Whether or not that's offset by the people attracted to it for trading altcoins I don't know. Maybe without that there wouldn't be as much invested in it.
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:37:33
I think the point they're making is that creating a new coin *is* inflation if you view cryptocurrency as a whole as opposed to each currency individually. Not sure I agree but it's an interesting point of view.

Because we want to lower the barrier off entry. People can get to grips with it more easily the more similar it is to stuff you already know. Also keeping track of how many digits you're writing down for every day purchases is a pain. Your not going to accidentally give £100 for a £10 pizza but you could pay 0.03 BTC instead of 0.003.

No, of course I wouldn't. If you add a few zeros to my comment (and change the currency) then that's exactly what I just said. Besides, pizzas don't cost that kind of money. You are going to be very careful about how you spend $1,000,000. It's not an everyday purchase like a pizza.
Why do you have a problem with it? Don't you want Bitcoin to be more widely adopted?

Probably some commodity. Something that has value in the real world. But we already have gold and silver etc and we don't use them as money. It's probably bitcoin or bust (or possibly some other cryptocurrency).
Or here's a terrifying idea: personal data. That sort of is the case already considering all the "free" services we get in exchange for our data. That's much worse than printed currency in my opinion. It doesn't just manipulate the economy on the large scale like inflation, it also manipulates the consumer in such a subtle way that it's creating political division and instability all over the world. Not to mention that it's an invasion of our privacy.

I think the issue is that that's just about all you can do with bitcoin just now. When companies try to adopt bitcoin it doesn't work so well because they're still tied to fiat. As much as people like to point out that fiat currencies can be volatile you still know what you can buy for a dollar/pound/whatever. I think we need to find some way of tying bitcoin's price to something or we'll be stuck here forever.

I'm not saying it is. I'm saying that the legal structure isn't doing it's job if someone is sitting in prison for a crime they haven't been tried for.
I want to clarify that I have no skin in this game. I don't think drugs should be illegal but I know a lot more than that went on in the Silk Road and I also fully understand that the law must be upheld even where it is imperfect. If Ross Ulbricht attempted to have people killed then he should be brought to justice for that. That means a trial and a chance to disprove it. It sounds to me like he is serving time that he wouldn't have to serve had he not tried to have people killed yet if evidence came to light that disproves that he would have no conviction to overturn. That means he would be serving time for a crime he didn't commit.
@_date: 2019-02-14 18:46:28
How do the recommendations work then? I was under the impression the judge had a minimum and maximum sentence but so long as it's within those limits the actual sentence is entirely down to their own discretion. Is it the prosecution's recommendation?
Not particularly asking about this case: if someone got a harsher sentence based on other crimes that they are believed to have committed in the course of committing the crime they are being tried for but are later proven to be untrue, do they have any way of getting their sentence reduced?
@_date: 2019-02-14 22:51:35
That's interesting. Thanks!

I don't know much about lightning so this might be a stupid question. Would losing internet connection mean that the lightning connection closes? So you'd be charged transaction fees every time? 
@_date: 2019-02-14 02:35:03
Then essentially he has been convicted for a crime he hasn't been tried for. Does the judge have to qualify their decisions? Like is it written anywhere that he is receiving such a harsh sentence because he tried to have people killed? If it turned out that he actually didn't order any hits would he be able to appeal his sentence? 
@_date: 2019-02-14 04:35:55


This wording suggests that the judge needs to base his sentence on the evidence of the case. I was asking if that is enforced or if its just how they're expected to do their jobs. I'm completely aware that his sentence is for the crimes he was convicted of in the eyes of the law but if he has a harsher sentence because of other crimes he committed then he is being punished for them without trial. Legal or not. If evidence came to light that proved that he never attempted to have anyone killed he wouldn't be able to appeal that conviction because it doesn't exist, yet may be the reason he will never get out of prison.
As for who cares, anyone who cares that the law be fair, consistent and for the good of society should. You don't lock someone up for being a piece of shit, you lock them up for the crimes they have been found guilty of.
@_date: 2019-02-14 15:05:54
They haven't made a point. All they said is that my point is wrong. Doing that or attacking my character does nothing to further the argument. If someone can show me how I'm wrong by disputing what I have to say then I will gladly accept it. People disagreeing with me is not evidence that I'm wrong. I haven't twisted anything though I may have misunderstood something. Feel free to clear up any points I'm not getting.

@_date: 2019-02-14 20:03:15
My username is actually intended to discourage people from just downvoting me and get them to explain why they disagree and actually have a conversation. I know it winds some people up because they think I'm being arrogant and proclaiming that *I can't be proven wrong* but it still works because some people can't resist the challenge and I think that's worth the turbulence. Maybe the comment you first responded to was a little rude but I was trying to point out that this style of argument gets us nowhere but round in circles.
I understand that the judge had every legal right to give him the sentence that he got but if that sentence would have been lesser had he not tried to have people killed then yes, he is serving time for that crime (whether or not that's what it says on the paperwork). And he should! But he should be tried for it. I'm not arguing for absolute sentences. I know there are countless other variables that can't possibly be coded into law and people fall between the cracks. It sucks but it's life. If it's purely a case of human fallibility on the part of the judge then there isn't really anything more to say on the matter unless the judge's sentencing procedure can be questioned (what I was asking originally). Also if the sentence has nothing to do with his other crimes then it's a moot point. But if he serves more time because of crimes he has not been tried for then I don't think that's justice and the law has failed. Even if he's guilty.
Imagine you were arrested for something that carries a 1-5 year prison sentence and the arresting officer falsely accuses you of assaulting them. If you think you can prove you were innocent of the original crime you would put your energy into disproving that and not worry about the assault until you're actually charged. If you are then found guilty and given the full five years because the coinciding (untrue) assault shows that you are a danger to society when otherwise it would have been a one year sentence, is that justice? Or are you spending four years in prison for a crime you did not commit?
If the Ulbricht case is different in anything other than the magnitude of the crimes then I'm missing something.

The issue with this attitude is that if we refuse to deal with false claims it gives him the opportunity to develop an unopposed narrative that new people getting involved in Bitcoin won't know enough to see through. If the argument on the other side amounts to "he's wrong because he's wrong" then that makes him seem like the reasonable one.
We all know he's full of shit. New people don't and there will be a lot more new people in the next few years. How many people have you talked to who don't know the difference between Bitcoin and bitconnect?

I'm not sure but I think liberals dislike it mainly because of the environmental impact and a little bit because of the libertarian association.
A bigger reason though is probably because they don't understand what it is. Meaning how it works and what problems it seeks to solve. This isn't really a political thing though. Lots of people don't understand it and think that it's more or less just a form of gambling. But I think a lot of people on the left who are opposed to it have no idea that they are arguing in favour of keeping money in the hands of rich bankers. I think it likely that people may change their tune as it becomes more widely understood.

@_date: 2019-04-08 07:52:13
Too many people who are interested in Bitcoin see it as a counter culture thing and evidence that they are more enlightened than everyone else. It's a disruptive technology that addresses a specific societal issue whilst slightly missing the mark (and that's okay, I believe it was designed to evolve) its not a whole philosophy.

I think you're missing the point. It's not that anything here means that Bitcoin will be as successful as TV or aeroplanes, it's saying that people who are confidently predicting it's failure should probably take a lesson from history and be a little less arrogant about it or they could make themselves look foolish. Skepticism is perfectly reasonable but thinking you know the future is not, especially if you don't understand the thing you're panning which seems to be the case for the majority of Bitcoin's outspoken critics.

@_date: 2019-09-25 00:35:22
I would imagine you'd effectively end up with one line centred on the average price for that period. Which could be useful.
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:26:56
You linked to an article that did then told someone to read it before they criticise the inclusion of open and close prices. I don't think dots are necessarily a bad idea, I'd need to see it in action. When I was trying it I personally preferred the uncoloured bar charts. It put less emphasis on unnecessary information to distract me. Just the wick on it's own would tell you the same thing that a candlestick or bar chart would if the open and close are meaningless.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:07:41
But the candlestick chart was invented to track the daily price movement. It makes sense because the trading stops on the close of each candle. Why is it useful to see that information when tracking a continual price movement? Why is the first and last price any more significant than any other for a given minute/hour/whatever when there's nothing that separates one from the next?
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:55:30
I don't wanna.
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:04:23
I've done a little bit of trading so I'm familiar with it. The reason I'm questioning it is that candlestick patterns rely on the size and position of the real body compared to the wick as well as the colour. That is determined by the open and close prices. If those don't actually signify anything then why are we tracking them and using them to make predictions?

If you and I decided that Bitcoin should be making new blocks every five minutes instead of every ten but couldn't convince the core developers to implement that then we could fork Bitcoin with our own mining algorithm. We haven't created a new cryptocurrency, it's still Bitcoin in a sense. However much Bitcoin you had before the fork you now have the same amount of the forked currency. Even if you have no idea it exists. We just mined the next block on the chain with our new algorithm but before that us the same exact blockchain as the real Bitcoin. Then if people agree with us they can just start using our fork with the same wallet keys and the same amount of currency. If everyone switched then our fork would be the main Bitcoin.

Not really. The WiFi turns on whether you want it to or not to get location data. Even if you turn off location services. Not sure if that's true for iPhones or just android but you'd be better off getting a raspberry pi or an old computer or something like that if you don't want to spend money on a dedicated hardware wallet. Or a paper wallet if you're just hodling. 
Just realised you said "powered off". I still wouldn't. It could still be compromised. If someone manages to get a hold of your secret key or seed it doesn't matter if it's turned off. It's unlikely to happen but it only needs to happen once.
I'm not an expert so do your own research but I'd recommend getting a hardware wallet, raspberry pi (that you never connect to the internet) or paper wallet. Back up your keys and keep your secret key off of anything with Internet access.
Edit: And if you use an old computer make sure to format it first.
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:01:02
There's the energy usage. There are arguments to be made either way on that but it's not a non-issue. There's also the fact that it's difficult to keep things decentralised forever. Also the fact that the price moves so much because it's not tied to anything concrete irl. That's not really true because the cost of electricity should be the stabilising factor. However that hasn't really worked as planned and that's a legitimate concern.
I believe in Bitcoin but let's not get carried away. It's only going to work if we acknowledge and address it's issues. We need to not become a cult.
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:18:21
Not really. This whole thread is about an attack that didn't steal anyone's keys. My point is that if you turn it on at any point (like, to install the wallet app) you can't guarantee it won't connect to a network. If it does, that's a point of entry for an attacker. Even if it's only turned on for a few minutes that could give someone an opportunity to steal your keys.
No strategy can guarantee your keys are safe but keeping your wallet completely air gapped from any network is the safest bet. A switched off phone probably isn't as risky as keeping your Bitcoin on Coinbase or a wallet on your main PC but I think you're better to err on the side of paranoia for this sort of thing so I wouldn't recommend it.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:43:46
I won't get into a point by point argument because that completely misses the point I'm making. You acknowledge that their are issues and that this is uncharted territory but you think that doing the research properly could only result in people being for it. Those two things don't go together. There is plenty of room for reasonable people to disagree on this topic. Uncharted territory means we need to proceed cautiously.
It's not scientific to declare you've found the answer without all the variables. It is scientific to try and prove yourself wrong.
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:20:23
Keeping your Bitcoin in a secure offline wallet solves most of the problems though. No matter what we do to make keeping your coins on something like Coinbase more secure, hackers are going to find a way round it. If Coinbase or some other company want to become more like a bank and offer compensation for fraud then fine but if they don't do that then all we can do is stress the importance of having your own keys and keeping them offline. If mainstream adoption relies on something happening that is unlikely then we have no option but to work around that. We need to keep stressing the importance of hardware wallets until not having one is as obviously a bad idea as not wearing your seat belt.

The average person doesn't understand the technology well enough to see through the bullshit. It's not us we need to worry about him fooling. I think ignoring him is dangerous.
