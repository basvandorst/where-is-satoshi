Haha, at no point did I hate on miners. I even commented that in some circumstances it is profitable to mine, just not always. Stating it is not always profitable to mine =/= hating on miners.

We have not, our assumptions hold true even if you get all your mining hardware for free. We are basing this on the cost of electricity, which you do not pay for once and use as much as you want, you pay for based on usage. And in many cases, the cost of the electricity your mining hardware uses on a month by month basis massively outstrips the expected value of the bitcoin that will generate.

No, because the person who just mined it has spent money for electricity to be able to. So that money is just as lost as the person who bought it outright.

You are missing the point again then. If it costed e.g. $1,000 in electricity to mine 1 bitcoin sure you would be ahead now even if bitcoin cost $500 each at the time of mining. But if you had just spent that $1k on 2 bitcoins right at the start and skipped the mining, you would have 2 total bitcoin and have more no matter how much the price of a bitcoin had risen.
If the cost to mine is more than the cost to buy directly, it is always the better financial play to buy directly. The conclusion is not to never acquire bitcoin if it is expensive to mine them, it is to acquire bitcoin in the cheapest manner possible, whether that be by mining or buying them off an exchange etc.

There could be a number of reasons, including wanting to support bitcoin as a technology (but not caring primarily about financial reward). At some times / with some hardware mining is profitable, so on those occasions they might be mining for financial rewards. If you somehow have access to free or extremely cheap electricity it is more likely to be worth mining. Also it is possible some of the people who are mining are doing so because they have made inaccurate estimations of the expected costs / returns and will lose money even though they don't realise it.

Yeah so at that time it made sense to mine, because the difficulty wasn't as prohibitive. Certainly I am not trying to argue it is never a good idea to mine. But in the intervening time between 2013 and now, you would have more total bitcoin if at the times when mining was very difficult you had stopped mining and used the electricity money you saved to buy bitcoin directly.
