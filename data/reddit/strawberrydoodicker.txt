Learn what? I'm still waiting for a convincing counter argument from you
All I'm getting from you, and others, is 'lolololollolol I've made millions of dollars from other Bitcoin gamblers, I'm rich, you're just jealous :^ ) Downvoted! FUD! Troll! Infidel! Tiny jew virgin cock! Sit down son, adults are talking about appeals to authority!' - all of which is completely irrelevant to the points raised in my original post concerning the viability of Bitcoin.

And your 'purchasing power' has more than halved recently
Do you know where that purchasing power comes from? No, not from Bitcoin, and not from me, but from other fools who 'invested' their life savings into Bitcoin.
The money they put in is taken out by the early adoptors, leaving them with virtually nothing once all is said and done. It is a pyramid scheme, with a small group of early adoptors at the top, and the rest at the middle and bottom.
Early adoptors have already cashed out and bought Lamborghinis - do you think that money came out of thin air? Do you think they earned it as other people do? No, it comes from greedy speculators and the vulnerable.
I read one story here of a guy in his 50s who invested his retirement money into Bitcoin near the peak, because he only had a few thousand to begin with, and he needed to provide for both himself and his disabled wife once he retires. He was literally betting on a hope, and in a matter of months, he has lost more than half of the small amount he initially had.
That's the disgusting reality of Bitcoin. Not only is it doomed to failure, it is immoral and fraudulent.
I suggest you cash out soon, otherwise you'll end up as one of the bagholders. You may have already realized that in the past few months, the amount you can cash out has reduced by more than half
