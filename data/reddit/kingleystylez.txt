No one knows what you have, apart from every single person you ever transacted with. They all know what’s in your wallet because they can look into the ledger to see where their payment came from. And then target you with a 5$ wrench attack. 
The better choice would be to choose a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency like Monero. At least for the main part of your money.

According to this chart, yes. Otherwise 2 words would result in 2048 x 2047 combinations instead of the listed 2048 x 2048 (= 4.194.304) combinations.

I’m not American. I just care about the rule of law. You seem to think Trump is above the law. What are you telling your children when they ask you what you did when democracy and the rule of law died?
Edit:And sorry, I can't look over your shoulder and help you understand 24 written pages. I also never said anything about what I think about this arrest. I only said he's no one to praise.

We both have different moral standards on who to praise but I respect your point of view.

I don’t apply it. The indictment of Roger Stone does. Maybe you should read that up before you tell me to “get over it” ��

You have seen the Mueller report I guess? ��
@_date: 2019-04-11 12:50:26
Did I say so? All I’m saying is that we should see the report instead of believing a especially for that reason installed Trump nominee and before we scream “TOTAL AND COMPLETE EXONERATION” ��

I don’t assume anything and stop trying to justify everything with political bias. It’s getting boring and it’s very telling that you are attacking me personally all the time instead of objectively staying on topic. This is my last reply to you, I wish you all the best.

This should be the top post. I had a lot of respect for him back in the days of Collateral Murder and he did the right thing back then. I always thought those rape allegations in Sweden were a bit phony and just a reason to get him extradited to the US. But his obvious role in the 2016 election makes it clear that he’s nothing more than a willing instrument for Russian intelligence.

Please read up on Barrs history of cover ups in relation to Iran Contra. Not saying he’s doing that again right now, but he did it before. This is why it’s important to see the report instead of trusting his word.

I changed my mind about Assange when I read the Stone indictment. Did you read it?
@_date: 2019-04-11 12:53:48
Are we believing cherry picked quotes from a biased source now? By the way, Barr himself said his letter should NOT be perceived as a summary. Seems like you don’t know what he said.

Well, Obama pardoned Manning and she's now back in jail under the Trump administration. I woudn't have high hopes if I were you.
On second thought: While he doesn't care about whistleblowers, he seems to care about loyalty. So Assange maybe actually gets a pardon.

Have you seen the report or are you just trusting the Trump nominee on that? ��

In general, I of course understand the need for redactions in regard to a release to the public. I nevertheless think, that Congress or at least the “Gang of 8” should be able to see an unredacted report. It just can’t be that the only eyes who see the full report of the investigation AND the underlying evidence into something are the eyes of the person that got the job from the person who was investigated. This should really be obvious for everyone, politics aside.
Next to the first three categories of things he wants to redact (1. material subject to 6(e) (jury information), 2. material that the intelligence community identifies as potentially compromising sensitive sources and methods, 3. material related to ongoing investigations) that i fully understand, but believe at least the “gang of 8” should see in full, I’m very concerned about the fourth category of redactions he mentioned in his letter. “Information that would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties”. This leaves way too much room for him to redact what ever he wants and there is also no legal basis to that. Ask Monika Lewinsky.
I want to thank you for your constructive question.
