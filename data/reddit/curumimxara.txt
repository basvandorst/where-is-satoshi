I know I'll get heavily downvoted, but this is why I've been avoiding using Bitcoin as a currency as a private citizen. I really, really don't want the "average joe" do be able to quickly track how much funds I have, and even if I have multiple wallets it's not that hard to track down the source of the funds. I don't know. Bitcoin needs to step up its private properties.

I'm extremely interested in cryptocurrencies that protect the private characteristics of the people, yes. Monero is one of them, but I personally believe that it's still far from perfect.

Features like these are very welcome, although they're useful only on the short term and against "average joes" (which I mentioned in my comment). For now governments and other institutions are relying on blockchain analysis companies that can easily track transactions, even if they're churned.
I also say short term because this kind of analysis is still in its infancy and it should get more popular and easily accessible to corporations and criminals in the long term.
People can easily see how technology can help Bitcoin, but I'm often perplexed that the same people can't see how technology can be used against them.
If one thinks that in 5 years people won't have access to a piece of software that can simply "track" one's wallet and estimate its real funds in Bitcoin, then one is being naive. This is one of the biggest problems with Bitcoin at the moment, in my humble opinion.
We could talk about it. Or we can just downvote my comment. Whatever you think is the best course of action.

You do understand that this is extremely dangerous given the nature of the human being, right? You truly can't imagine all the people who are going to be threatened, harassed and killed because of human greed? If everyone knows how much 'money' everyone has, there's literally nothing avoiding huge assassination sprees -- even more in poorer countries. You know, those countries where we say we want to 'bank the unbanked'...

I really hope this sets an example. If by any chance a raise in Bitcoin value happens again to a point many of us will have a fortune, I really expect people doing exactly what the Pineapple Fund did and, who knows, maybe leave the world a better place than it was before crypto.

Upvoted, this should be the top comment.

Opt-in privacy is not privacy. Also, you need to trust these mixing services, even more decentralized ones like with CoinJoin or masternodes. Bitcoin is great because it's trustless. Let's not add trust in the equation.
There's also the [BlockSci system]( which is used to do analysis in transparent blockchains. They found that for Dash (a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin with a CoinJoin-based mixing service), over half of their test mixed transactions could be traced back with absolute certainty by simply following the transaction amounts.
You either get full privacy by default or it's not private. Unfortunately it's like that. We can argue that privacy is just a "feature" or even a "niche", which wouldn't be wrong, but you can bet it's kinda dangerous that people don't care at all if they can be surveilled.

When these are applied in Bitcoin in a way that renders all Bitcoin equal and impossible to taint/blacklist (thus, fungible), we can discuss again.


Interesting! I said that in a comment yesterday. I agree.


You mean 'alternative' as an option or 'alternative' as it's going to surpass and render Bitcoin obsolete? Monero is the current alternative for people who have high threat models who need absolute privacy. There are multiple cases of people getting busted by Bitcoin ledger analysis. I didn't say it will overcome Bitcoin.


I don't. If BTC fails, in my opinion, pretty much everything else will fail.


It isn't, not in its current state at least. As I said, it's the alternative for people seeking higher levels of privacy. Not even once I said it's a 'contender' to Bitcoin?
I really don't understand what you're debating here. My first comment is that Monero is a solid project. Then you said it wasn't solid. Then I went to explain why I believe it's a solid project and its differences from Bitcoin, while saying that I respect the different opinions we might have about what makes "sound money". I never stated Monero is generally a better option than Bitcoin, but your comment really tries to paint my previous comments as if they came someone who thinks Monero will shit over Bitcoin which is simply not true.

Oh well I guess a lot of people are transacting in a daily basis with Bitcoin testnet. Merchants and darknet markets alike. The latter is even risking their own physical security in using what is analogous to Bitcoin testnet! I'm sorry I'm laughing a little bit.
And anyone reading the above comment can now understand with a live example what I mean when I say that Bitcoin maximalists are very close-minded and stupid in their own naive way.
Good luck with your endeavors!

I'm unsure about which scandal you're talking about. Maybe it was when u/fluffyponyza said he had a 'Monero announcement' ([tweet  here]( and it was actually just a [troll video](
If it's not that, which is neither a scandal nor dishonest, then I don't know what it is.
Oh well some people got 'angry' because they thought it was a real announcement. It wasn't. And honestly? I personally believe he did a very good thing with this and proved a solid point. He never was and never will be responsible for the Monero Project and what he says should not reflect the protocol. [More info about this event here]( if you're interested.
Oh, and if you have some free time and would like to know the story of CryptoNote coins (the protocol that is completely different from Bitcoin), including Monero, read [this BitcoinTalk thread]( It's extremely amusing and very, very informative.

Scalability is also a problem in Bitcoin? Lightning Network is also applicable to Monero by the way. Nothing new there.
The 6-month hard fork system is a temporary one so the protocol can keep getting important updates that are being developed quite fast. This is not going to be an ongoing thing forever. Core developers and other community members already stated it. u/smooth_xmr said once (can't find his comment on reddit) that optimally the "hard fork" (which is just the technical name for software version upgrade when there's consensus) will happen once every few years, maybe once every 10 years when the protocol gets to its peak performance and stable. So, I agree it's untenable but this is not supposed to keep going _ad infinitum_.


English is not my first language so I don't understand what you mean. Monero is private by default, you can't just decide your transaction won't use the privacy technologies like stealth addresses, ringCT and ring signatures. This is what makes Monero fungible.


Maybe we can have divergent opinions on this, but I'm not comfortable stating that Bitcoin is fungible if it can be tracked in some form. Unless Bitcoin uses sound technology that will render it obfuscated and private by **default** like Monero (which is a completely different discussion that I would be happy to have), it won't be fungible. And if won't be fungible, it can't become real digital cash -- it can be many valuable things, but not **real** digital cash. But hey, who am I, right? I'm just a random redditor sharing my opinion.
If you visit the darknet markets you will see a lot of people using Monero. Some markets are even Monero-exclusive and won't accept anything else. We may also have different definitions of "solid" but in my book that's a solid cryptocurrency that is not vaporware like 99% of the alternatives out there (which has been my point since my first comment).
And never, never forget that I not once said Bitcoin was bad. I'm a privacy advocate so it's just natural that Monero got my attention in a deep way but lord I do love myself some Bitcoin.
By the way, cool username :)

If you've been in the space for more than a year you know projects like Monero are solid. I also find Bitcoin maximalists very close-minded (and stupid in their own naive way), but they have a point since 99% of the alternative cryptocurrencies are useless.
I just think the 1% deserves recognition :)
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:22:27
all of this is good, but do you really believe that the "masses" will have this kind of attention when dealing with their money? we got too many bad habits because of the "convenience" of the current financial system, including instant transactions using credit cards.
my point being, if you only use monero you won't be obliged to do some 'extra steps' to maintain your privacy. then, if by some reason you need to do a transparent transaction (like paying taxes or making donations) you will use bitcoin. trying to achieve optimal-privacy with bitcoin as *main currency* would be really cumbersome for the vast majority of the average people.
