 I agree with Statement 
Statement  not so much: See below,
"Private Key WIF
51 characters base58, starts with a '5'
Private Key WIF Compressed
52 characters base58, starts with a 'K' or 'L'
Private Key Hexadecimal Format (64 characters [0-9A-F]):
Private Key Base64 (44 characters):"
The above four mentioned are all possibilities
Have we thought about checking from right to left or bottom to top?

As CEO of CoinStructive, we are planning to help BitcoinCuba.org go back in early December to hold multiple workshops/seminars. It is part of our plan to get some nodes running. We will be prepared to face difficulties, but that's never stopped Bitcoin before.
