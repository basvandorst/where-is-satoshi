I am 2 thirds the way there.  Hoping to be at my goal for this year by end of October.

Not lost til you sell.

It's still coming.  I just have weekly buys.  Increasing the amount of BTC I have.  Long term Hodlers don't care about price fluctuations cause this baby is going to the moon!

Been using coinbase/GDAX for over a year.  Most secure exchange to date.

I bought Bitcoin last August and it went down 40% in a couple of days.  It's volatile and it's normal in crypto

Fluctuation is what I would call it

Every asset is speculation.

Fear of missing out

I just bought another grand too.... Can't pass up a sale!

You can sell your BTC direct into your account but coinbase gives you less for it.  But if you need it instant it can be.

all of my transactions are instant on coinbase and GDAX

By end of this month

So what.  Don't buy then.  Leave the rest of us idiots alone.

Take total maket cap of all coins and divide by present number of Bitcoin would be my guess.  However more coins did help with interest in crypto.

One doesn't post such things. But regardless the amount.  When the future completely arrives we will be mesuring our wealth with something other than Fiat.  For now I believe it to be BTC.
