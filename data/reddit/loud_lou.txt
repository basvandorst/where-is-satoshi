Thanks for that, any other file types/names for wallets/miners that come to mind that would have been utilized in the 2010-2011 era?

Fortunately it is on my friends and I'm on a complete different computer/network than what it would be on.

Going to take the high road and say that I appreciate your concern for keeping trash out of the sub.
If there is any other useful information that can be provided please let me know.  Otherwise we can let this die and stop feeding the flames from RailsIsAGhetto

This sub is about helping people learn about the technology and communicate news to help the community.  
Post like the above don't help.  I greatly appreciate all the positive feedback given thus far :)  it's a stretch, but I'll be sure to let you all know if anything turns up.

Tell me im not the only person who read this as "Dave Chappelle"

Yeah, I ended up moving it over.  Thanks for the insightful comments.  It just seems at this point in time the smart move because it gives you a choice.  With a Jaxx wallet, I'd have to wait 2 weeks to see the Bitcoin Cash leaving no choice of if I wanted to sell.
I hope it goes well for most people.  I've tried to read as much as possible to be prepared but nothing can prepare you for exactly what the outcome will be.

Care to share any sites and help the community rather than just a flame?

Is there an app?  Can this be integrated with calendars? 
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:27:36
I know its last moment, but if anyone has feedback I'd greatly appreciate it. Been reading like crazy and trying to determine the appropriate steps.

This is what I've gathered...I'm debating moving from Jaxx
