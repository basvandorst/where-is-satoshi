I would, but I don't actually own any bitcoins. I suppose I could buy some, but I haven't researched how to go about all that yet.

Thanks! Oh, I suppose you're right. If I really want to maximize my sales I probably shouldn't tease potential customers. Also, when someone asks for a coupon code for the site, I really shouldn't give them this one: "frs7877red"
OK, I changed it to be less inflammatory: Pay with Bitcoins using secure online processing by Bitpay. Yep, you can use your digital currency to buy an actual physical game that we will ship to you and you can hold in your hands. Welcome to the fucking future.

I actually do have to give them a lot of credit, they managed to put together a system that was as easy to implement and use as Paypal, and that can't be easy. I certainly can't complain about their fee structure. The only problems I ran into stemmed from my own ignorance about how bitcoin works.

Cool, thanks!

We don't really advertise too much. None at all since we realized we were going to be low on stock so soon. Part of the problem is that we started doing more wholesale sales, and that ended up knocking us out of stock a month and a half faster than we anticipated. It's a good problem to have, but it's still really frustrating.
Like CAH themselves, we're printed in China, so the turn-around time on a new printing is really long. Think months, not weeks.

Our product is so niche and I've done so little to let people know about the BTC payment option that I'm not sure my example proves much of anything at all.
I can see where if your business is something that appeals to the bitcoiner demographic--like tiger direct or these precious metals guys here--adding bitcoins to your business model could really give you a serious competitive advantage over time.

According to their FAQ, it doesn't exist yet.
I don't particularly care for the account transaction limits they have by default, but I understand they have regulatory requirements that make them necessary.

Humidity, not humanity.
Perfectly sober. Was looking at mock-ups of cards with about 40 different possible names, and this one was least discernible out of peripheral vision. Took a couple of hours to make the decision, though.
Runner up was Crabs Across Hungary, but we thought that sounded silly.

It's good to know that some businesses are seeing bitcoin sales. Several weeks ago, I quietly added bitcoin (using bitpay) to the list of accepted payment methods on my site ( Surprisingly, I haven't seen a single bitcoin sale, so I'm not even sure if it's working. 
I only added it because half a dozen people had asked about it and I figured, why not?
UPDATE: It's working! To whoever put that order through, I really appreciate it! I'm throwing in a free t-shirt and some stickers in the box as a thank you for being our first bitcoin customer (just emailed to ask what size you wear).
Also thank you to the people who replied and PM'd with suggestions for improvements. We'll make some changes based on your feedback.
