The merchants you speak of are only interested in exchanging bitcoins immediately for dollars.  However, to evaluate the volatility of the purchasing power of a bitcoin, held as a bitcoin, you should consider daily, weekly and monthly volatility.  So while *accepting* bitcoins is fine for the risk averse merchant, it still might be scary for him to *keep* them on their books as bitcoins.

icbit is run by anonymous russians, but they are trustworthy insofar as they have held large amounts of coins for long periods of time and not run away with them.  Their margin requirements have tightened over the last few months, so the action has diminished, but so has the number of defaulting customers.  MPEX is reliable and the owner has made his identity public.  He is a controversial public figure, but his exchange is run by a strict set of rules.  the X.EUR future is very cool, as it is a physically delivered future -- the first of its kind.

According to the terms of service, you must outlay all USD on day 1.  After 6 months you receive 1/24 of your BTC, and every month for 23 months thereafter you receive another 1/24.  So it's not quite 20%, it's more like 15%.  And besides, because it's bitcoin + credit card, it's probably a scam.  Consider what happens if they don't deliver the first payment, six months into the forward.  Your recourse is to reverse the charges on your credit card.  Oh, what's that, it's been six months?  Sorry, there's a six month limit on canceling charges.  You're stuck with a bunch of nothing!

@_date: 2012-12-02 18:36:16
What level of anonymity are you going for?  For instance, how will you accept physically delivered gold at a specific location and remain anonymous?  If it's a Silk Road level of anonymity, the buyer's address must be known.  And then I see no reason why Silk Road shouldn't be able to execute forward contracts with their current technology.  If the buyer wishes to stay anonymous, I'm afraid the clearinghouse must remain centralized and public.  Forward contracts give either the buyer or seller ample room to sneak away from the trade when the price moves, making the trust issues already inherent in any bitcoin transaction extend over the life of the forward contract.
@_date: 2012-12-02 20:14:00
The specifics of delivery on a *futures* contract are certainly not up to the issuer (short).  Those are set beforehand by a futures exchange.  Forward rate agreements between two parties, on the other hand, can contain whatever delivery specifications the two parties can agree to.
If forwards are what the OP is looking for, then we should be talking about a market for OTC commodity forward agreements, in which case SR is already the best option.

Your QT client will probably say "Synchronizing with network" and have a blue bar at the bottom describing its progress.  This will take a few days.  Yeah, somebody's working on that.  Your computer is downloading and verifying the entire blockchain.  It's a necessary step for your QT client to be able to see (spend) the free coins you just got.  Here's a tip because you're patient.

Block 0 says Satoshi has 50 coins.
Block 1 says Satoshi has 50 coins and Blockfinder1 has 50 coins.
If you tell me that you found Block 1 after Blockfinder1 already did it, i'm going to say no, somebody already found it.
In other words, the longest chain of blocks is the one most people are going to accept as the official chain.

The EFF did not reject Bitcoin.  It rejected *bitcoin donations* specifically to be able to remain neutral during possible future litigation against a Bitcoin user.  From July of last year: "While EFF is often the defender of people ensnared in legal issues arising from new technologies, we try very hard to keep EFF from becoming the actual subject of those fights or issues. Since there is no caselaw on this topic, and the legal implications are still very unclear, we worry that our acceptance of Bitcoins may move us into the possible subject role."

Hi SheSins,  if you are new and interested, you probably don't want to enter the mining business.  Just like if you were suddenly interested in gold, you would probably be better buying it than mining for it.  Explore the sidebar to find the correct exchange for you. Or here:   Even better, here's 0.01 bitcoins--that's 9 days worth of letting your computer melt trying to mine for them.

you probably already have your answer by now.  I was just stating econ 101: with perfect competition MC = P.  In other words, if you have a miner and you want to sell all the bitcoins you generate, you will only do so if the cost of mining is lower than the price.
to be perfectly honest, bitcoin mining has become so specialized that you would need to invest serious amounts of money (in the hundreds of thousands of dollars) in order to operate profitably.  you would be better off selling goods or services in exchange for bitcoin, or just get them from the exchange.

The author, Adrianne Jeffries, bought near the high in 2011 in no small part based off the advice of one Bruce Wagner on The Bitcoin Show.  Then, having stored her coins at mybitcoin.com, lost all of them.  Whether she got half of them back is unknown, but i expect her Bitcoin press to sound like this whether she writes at BetaBeat or TheVerge or whatever.  You know, kind of like, "I know all about Bitcoin but because I had a bad experience, I will write how it is a scam-magnet for everyone."  Ok, so it IS a scam magnet.

Physically-settled futures are arguably less prone to manipulation than cash-settled futures.  When you enter into a physically-settled futures contract, you either deliver the coins or face a hefty penalty.  With the "threat" of delivery, market participants can't really manipulate the price (notable exceptions are short squeezes, but that can happen in cash-settled futures, too).  Cash-settled futures rely on the integrity of an underlying index, which can be pushed around.

"Domestic exchanges (such as they are) frequently offer slow service with high fees. A guideline amount is that charged by Coinfloor - £5 to deposit BTC and £10 per withdrawal – far higher than a EUR deposit on another major exchange, for example."
This is a bit unfair to Coinfloor.  They are the best exchange in the UK, their service is not slow, and it bears saying that a flat 10 pounds for a withdrawal is not very expensive.  They have done an excellent job in the UK given the difficulty of finding banking relationships.

The depositor of EUR in this bank is exposed to drops in the EUR/BTC rate.  If I deposit 1mm EUR into the bank when the EUR/BTC rate is 100, they will purchase (or borrow) 10,000 BTC to back up my deposit.  If EUR/BTC goes up to 200, and I want to withdraw my 1mm EUR, they sell 5,000 BTC back to the market and I get my 1mm EUR.  However, if EUR/BTC goes to 50 and I want to withdraw my 1mm EUR, they have NO POSSIBLE WAY of selling 10,000 BTC for anything more than 500,000 EUR.  Cypriots beware!

CEX.io charges 0.2% fee to sell, and there is a flat withdrawal fee of $35 (this might be lower, check with them).  Suppose you noticed an arbitrage opportunity for 10 bitcoins.  The USD withdrawal fee at CEX represents 0.77%.  So before we even talk about the exchange where you are buying bitcoins -- you didn't mention one by name -- be aware that you are already paying 0.97% to make only 0.66%.  Beware of fees!

The lending rate between parties often uses LIBOR as a reference rate.  In that case, the two parties are free to decide the proper rate, eg LIBOR + 1.25%.  LIBOR is just a panel-based index, it is not the rate at which you are forced to borrow or lend at.  Feel free to use it or not.  Bitcoin lending/borrowing is so new that we aren't even close to getting a panel-based reference rate.  When we *do* have such a reference rate, there's going to be disagreements and disincentives to push that rate around as well.

Comparing bitcoin mining to gold mining might be appropriate here.  If you had free electricity in your building and you were interested in mining for gold, how profitable do you think you would be?

Valuation of the size of the economy aside, I think Mr. Falkvinge underestimates the value speculators place in Bitcoin.  He claims himself that the value of one bitcoin could reach a million dollars.  An investor might find it entirely reasonable to purchase bitcoins around here, especially given some recent Thiel remarks estimating that the chances Bitcoin takes off is 20%.  Why start blaming these elusive shark squad price-fixers?  The accusation doesn't hold water given the size of the audience (the world) and the amount of time the price has remained this high (several months).  BTC &lt;--&gt; fiat is not frictionless, but it's not run by a small group of people, either.
My guess?  People see great potential in bitcoins and are in fact willing to put the value magnitudes higher than the current size of the Bitcoin economy might dictate.
