It's more than that.  He was paid 20,000 euros by a Japanese to develop a website but never developed it and refused to return the money. He made threats against another client in France.  He was convicted of financial fraud in a third case.  There is a long history here of malfeasance.   Source:

The problem is you have just described trading while insolent which is a serious issue in most jurisdictions, Hong Kong included and can result in jail time for directors.  
Edit:  mean to type trading while insolvent but I like the ring of trading while insolent so leaving that in....

It seems to me there is a very strong connection between job security and consumer confidence.  However all of the labor reforms of the past 20 years have been about undermining job security in the name of productivity improvements (eg casualisation of the workforce, "right to work" legislation, loosening of the contractor rules etc).   If you have people constantly in fear of losing their jobs, how can they borrow ?
But the Central Banks are calling for greater productivity which is code for greater deregulation and increased job insecurity.  This is fundamentally counterproductive.  I don't understand how they can't see the wood for the trees.

This is one of the biggest thefts in world history and we are all just going to roll over and take it?  Not likely. 
These dumb fucks put 100% of customer deposits into a hot wallet while lying about it on their security policy and we are expected to be socialised so they can keep their honey pot humming along? 
Fuck em.  The FBI has jurisdiction because US dollars were used in trading.  And after that we can all issue statutory demands and petition the lot of them into bankruptcy.

A simple example: minimum wage legislation.  Why do you think would happen to consumer demand if the minimum wage were set at $2 per day and employers started paying that amount?  
It would plummet because there would be a race to the bottom and no one would be secure in the concept of a living wage.  
If you constantly take money away trom people in the name of productivity then they won't spend what little they have left, reinforcing deflationary expectations.

So it's entirely coincidence that I have been getting error messages on withdrawal until this address was replenished and then I was immediately able to withdraw and the coins just happened to come from this address? How would you explain that?

Well if there is a run on a bank (any bank), then yes that bank would be insolvent.  Which is why you have the FDIC.   
There is no FDIC for BFX.  
@_date: 2016-08-06 11:30:55
Insolvency is defined as the inability to pay one's debts as they fall due.  
Unless BFX has $72 million down the back of the couch, they are unable to repay all amounts owing to their creditors.   So they are insolvent.

I agree.  I will be amazed if anyone gets a cent back.  They will enable trading but block all withdrawals and it will be just like trading Goxcoin while the exchange sinks and the directors strip the assets.

You need to understand that minimum wage sets a floor.  As an employer you only need to pay someone more than they can get elsewhere.  If the floor is set at $2 per day, then I only need to pay my semi-skilled workers $2.50 per day.  
If the floor is set at $6.00 per hour, then I need to pay my semi-skilled workers $6.50 per hour to attract and retain a workforce because they know they can get $6 elsewhere.  
Likewise a skilled worker needs to see they are earning more than a semi-skilled worker, relatively speaking.   This is why maids in China earn  US$1hour, construction workers earn $2/hour and lawyers earn $7/hour.   It's all relative.  
I don't pay my workers what I think they are worth - I pay them a rate which is competitive in the market relative to what they can earn elsewhere.

Most bitcoiners assume those coins (over 1 million mined by Satoshi) will never move and the market has priced accordingly.  
If those coins start to move, the market will crash (at least initially).  
On the email front I have not seen any evidence that the satoshin email address ever belonged to Satoshi.

Not sure if you are being sarcastic or not but you do realize that the average BBC reporter has to cover an extraordinary range of subject matters each and every week?  Full credit to them for the job they do but as anyone who is an expert in any particular area can attest, quite often the press gets it wrong - especially when there is a professional con man at the other end of the telephone.

Meh it probably expired and someone grabbed it.  Or it could be a rogue GMX employee having some fun.  GMX is pretty dodgy.  Or Theymos could be wrong about it not being spoofed.  
I doubt Satoshi is the sort of person to store private keys on a third party email server.
