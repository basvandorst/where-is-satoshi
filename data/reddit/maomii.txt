Finance, and then the world economy, will one day be dominated by ruthless computer programmers with aspergers.
Perhaps the only thing that could stop this is if they drink too much red bull and the software that governs most of human life becomes even less stable.

I don't trust it until it has at least 6 conf.

I'm glad I know what a science fair experiment is (whereas redditors don't care about that so much as listing how science culminated into bitcoins) but it's quite a leap to say she won for being female and that this is indicative of why there are few women in science.
I really don't want to debate it, but your implication is just really bold and offensive.  By my perception, having gender brought under scrutiny over a science fair project at the age 11 has a bigger contribution to the state of women in science.

I can understand the want to connect people with similar challenges or perspectives, so I think it's an idea with potential.   But mostly what stands out to me on this is the horrible web design.
I'm not sure what more to say about the design. My first task was to learn more about this "magazine" and it looks like even the creator of it isn't quite sure yet or that it is just an attempt to "get something up right now".  It's hard to say whether this is a step ahead of just a basic wordpress.
I googled "Elisabeth T.Ploshay" and her own site uses a default wordpress design.  I have to say I am constantly annoyed (as a software developer) by the attitude of "just get something up right now, even if it's a trainwreck, we want user feedback before we have anything worth keeping".

This sort of view actually seems rather typical on reddit.

Welcome to the r/atheism of money

This wasn't funny at all.

I'm glad I'm not stuck in denial, I'd probably still be working on failed projects because not making money is part of the plan to make money.

Bitcoin is at short-term low, therefore there is a reddit conspiracy.

That algorithm is a bitcoin hating shill.

heh, it looks like you took my humor well, and I'm glad for that.  I liked your post, somebody had to say it, even if it's utopian.

You blazed something before writing that, didn't you?

Oh well, I don't want my money instantly, I just want it in a timely fashion (less than 7 days would be nice, we'll see), similarly to how I would like a reply to a support email.  I accept that I will have to wait longer than usual, and due to timing it won't affect me much (though it *could* have).  In the past their estimate on when I'd receive money was reliable, and why it's not right now, they haven't told me yet (only varying speculation on the threads).  I guess my point is, it's more than an issue of instant gratification even though patience is likely the solution.

This doesn't make sense.  They are divisible into 100,000,000 parts (satoshis), you can still purchase $150 worth of bitcoins and spend it all on soap.

I'll tell this to my landlord when I don't have the rent.
