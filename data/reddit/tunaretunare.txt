Brian Armstrong of Coinbase was advertising a new customer service manager position that's becoming available. 
Jordan Kelly should jump right on that. He seems pretty good.

Gyft still owes me $50 for their spend $1000 and get $50 back Black Friday deal.

Selling pressure. 
In light of the recent news, I put in for a 6-month subscription for Entertainment Weekly. The Time company sold  these coins, causing a price dip.

Maybe he cracked under pressure and is disbanding the operation.

Their donations department told me they only have so much room or "real estate" for donation banners/buttons. I understand this, but I will pass on donating until they make it easy to donate with bitcoins. As of now, you have to surf deeper into the site to donate bitcoins.

I love Overstock but most of my BTC went to Amazon via the Gyft app. Overstock needs to be just a hair more competitive with incentives to pay in BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-06 02:44:12
A buyer would have to work his way through the ranks by buying small orders first to even be eligible to pay for a larger order like a TV. By the time a buyer is eligible to pay for a TV, their account will have already been tested vs Amazon.com's anti fraud system and Purse.io's system a handful of times. This reduces the likelihood of fraudulent transactions.

2014 was the year of HODL
2015 is the year of Smaug! Who else is Smaugin' coins in 2015? 
@_date: 2014-12-15 21:03:37
Yes, I've started to use Purse.io as well. Overstock really needs to implement some sort of wishlist system so developers can set up BTC payment systems similar to Amazon

I've noticed over the years that the gaming community is probably the most negative when it comes to comments on bitcoins. "Nerd" used to be a good generalization for gamers. Now, most gamers are not educated, not open minded, and certainly not innovative.  They're not nerds. 
They are becoming unbalanced haters. Kruger effect.

Snapcard was a one man team with Tim Draper at the helm. He did all of the programming, customer service, and order filling. He quickly realized that filling orders all the time cut down on his ability to grow big, bushy eyebrows so damn well. 
Snapcard had a good run with the bookmarklet app, but they are putting their focus on merchant adoption now.

Time to Smaug yo' coins cuz we're going to be lunar soon.

I'm still waiting for Gyft to make good on the $50 back deal when you spend over $1,000
@_date: 2014-12-06 20:04:55
Can you please define "extremely invested"?
Because it doesn't sound like you were very invested.

The dynamics of the 20% off at Starbucks is different. 20% off won't happen at Target. I'd be surprised if they can provide a discount deeper than 10%. That being said, I'd be quite happy with even a 6% discount. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 21:47:31
U Smaugin' coins brah? 
@_date: 2015-05-10 15:00:52
Hmmm. Haven't  heard of that coin before. Is there a market cap on it? Or is there plenty of Rapecoin to go around? Is it possible to own a fraction? I.E. half a rape? 
@_date: 2015-05-10 15:15:41
I guess I was asking for it....
@_date: 2015-05-13 22:33:40
He only chimes in when price is down. Several months back, he said coin was going to be worth double digits very soon. 
I thinks he's perfectly spelling out how the next economic collapse will happen, but he's pretty misguided on bitcoin and will jump ship with his beliefs soon. He'll probably do the popular thing and support "blockchain technology" instead of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-05-10 15:14:11
Maybe we can fuel interest by giving handfuls of Statcha-rape out to the community. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 04:55:46
I've had zero issues until Black Friday. They didn't honor their $50 back when spending $1,000 deal. Support said they'd get back to me. But they didn't,  so I messaged them again.  They then said sorry, but we'll srsly look into it this time and get back to you. They never did. 
Whatevs. I just dropped the issue and am still using their services. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 00:01:03
But where do they bury the survivors?
@_date: 2015-01-23 18:45:38
Why don't you let people select the buyers like Brawker? I'd much rather be able to pick a buyer with many transactions under his belt. Even if it means lowering the discount that I give myself.  
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:14:51
.... and Peter Schiff said coin would never hit $260 again. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 03:15:02
I want to be able to select a bidder for my transaction like on Brawker. I'd want to make sure to award the sale to a member with a long transaction history and high rating. 4 credit card fraud transactions out of 10,000 is still a hair too risky for me.

The site has a few responsive kinks on my galaxy s5 (for both portrait and landscape), but I'm sure he'll work them out.

What you're asking to be developed isn't even remotely close to  a simple website unless people are exchanging play-money.

@_date: 2015-07-27 19:22:29
Can confirm. One of their checks bounced. I had to eat the bounce fee too. 
I have a feeling that shit-hit-the fan when their bank discontinued business with them for involvement with BTC. The next few banks pulled the plug on them immediately too. 
While it does suck to be out several hundred dollars, It probably actually does really suck to start an innovative BTC business at the moment. They probably meant well.

I've pushed a few transactions immediately after Trezor 0.0005 fee was implemented. I've seen no movement or confirmations for a handful of hours now. 
Raise priority fee more? Or at least give us another checkbox for 0.0015?

Try enabling all scripting on TOR just for the registration. It probably still will not work, but it's worth a try.

Bitcoin discount + membership discount from club O is going to be a killer combo.

I just tried to buy the anal sex behind the scenes video (srsly)
The system tries to make me punch in a mountain of information. No thanks. I could buy a plane ticket to North Korea by only providing my name, birthday, and email address. 
Will this be changed in the future?

The packing method of stuffing it inside the T-Shirt should have been fine, but I think the plastic case is too thin and brittle more than anything. The actual entropy device looks rugged though. 
@_date: 2015-03-28 19:34:12
USA here. My entropy case was cracked open. Almost shattered. I didn't check the seal though.i think it's a bit odd considering that the entropy case was wrapped in the TShirt  that came with it.

Their site needs better mobile responsiveness. It is hard to read their bios on both my Samsung  S5 and Note.

People should keep Chinese mobile manufacturing leviathan Xiaomi in mind. I think they're really going to suffocate Apple's market share. Yes, even in the USA eventually. 
They may not have their own payment system yet, but it's going to be hard for Apple to gain ground when less people use their phones.

Gyft still hasn't honored their $50 back for spending $1000 Black Friday / Cyber Monday deal for me. 
I'm done playing message tag with them, but I still use their services sometimes.  I use eGifter more than gyft now.

I've had to do this with E-Gifter once. It was brilliant. E-Gifter hardly knows shit about me and I use their services all the time. 
If you're curious about the circumstances, my State University, without warning canceled my email account about 8 years after undergrad. This was pretty much my main account for every real-world application, save for when I wanted to use an especially anonymous account. 
Nothing says give me my fucking account back than signing a message. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 16:38:07
I also bought a game. They required every piece of information that's required by a credit card transaction. Really peeves me.
Name, street, city, zip, country, phone number etc
