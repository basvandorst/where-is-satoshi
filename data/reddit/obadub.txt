You wrote a great article that I hope gets a lot of attention. My only issue with it is that your recommendations arent very feasible, imo. The first one I agree with but the second/third I'm not so sure about. 
In the age of cell phones, out of state numbers are going to ding too many calls for the red flag to mean anything. I moved away from my home state 8 years ago and have lived in 4 different states since then - should I have to change my number each time I leave? What about those with numbers via Google voice (or similar)? 
Where do you draw the line between a call that sounds suspicious but plausible and a call that is likely a fake?
The other big question is: what happens once you have a red flag? If I were to call 911 with my WV phone number while living in VA, does that change the police response time during a potentially life threatening situation?

Ahh that makes sense, thanks for clearing that up. Do they have this info for all incoming calls? If it's something they already do or can impiment at low cost, it would be easy to set up then. 


Another thing would be to enact stiff penalties for this type of thing (jail time, monetary, or whatever). It's really inexcusable. Anyway, I appreciate the response, sorry for your experience my man.
