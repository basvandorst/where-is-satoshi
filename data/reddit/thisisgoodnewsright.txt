last time I checked that page, GHash.io had ~50% of the hashrate. what happen to them?

Just like everything else in Russia.

expect your sales to spike when BTC will have a crash again.

can somebody explain the meaning of the map pictured and the flags in it? 
@_date: 2015-05-25 11:07:25
where is Lithuania in that list?

[Well, let's not start sucking each other's dicks quite yet.](
@_date: 2015-05-25 15:11:56
that's easy to see. any plans or ETA to introduce the service at this market?

just curiuous, how expensive it would be to spend all those inputs?
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:56:13
did I miss something, but when did Gavin Andersen left core and went to the opposite side?  
I well remember him being praised here as a leading core developer, then there was silence and now we see him together with Jihan and Ver.
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:49:09
yes, fees. this address has received 456 transactions totaling in 5.215 BTC. how much fees would be required to spend all this amount? also, do I get it correctly, that when spending, all these inputs are consolidating into 1 input, and subsequent transaction would be much cheaper?
@_date: 2015-08-21 13:42:06
get a trezor now. this is when I did that.
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:55:56
can someone explain to me, as an European - at what age do you graduate university in the US, and how much debt, on average, does every student have? is it like 10k, 20k, 50k or 100k USD?
@_date: 2015-07-28 06:43:33
~37.500 USD is a decent price for such a vehicle or have you just ended up paying a nice premium for seller to accept BTC? 
@_date: 2016-02-19 22:05:26
well, yeah, Russians really can predict if and where there will be a war.
@_date: 2016-09-11 16:35:43
considering it's Russia, and the source is rt.com, it's very likely to be staged.
@_date: 2017-10-11 05:54:16
can someone explain to me, who hasn't used coinbase ever - why on earth someone would buy bitcoin on Coinbase and wait over a week to get it confirmed, when at the same time, you can buy it at an exchange, with a highest reputation, like Kraken or Gemini, and get it immediately?

can someone ELI5 whats is this all new fuss about overt AsicBoost is about? isn't this the same bad technology Bitmain was bashed for? the same that they were patented? and is the word *overt* is the key here?
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:05:56
oh, i see, but i got those coins first, they belong to me!
@_date: 2015-11-10 07:32:12
did any winners or participants from this and also previous auctions reveal their bids?
@_date: 2015-03-05 08:12:53
there were already two auction in the past? I know only about the one, where Tim Draper won all the coins. any information on who won 50k BTC in the 2nd auction?  
EDIT, found some infor about the 2nd round, but also, regarding the total volume to be auctioned:  
1. 29.656 BTC, Jun 2014, Tim Draper, all 29.656 BTC;  
2. 50.000 BTC, Nov 2014, Second Market Syndicate, 48.000 BTC; Tim Draper 2.000 BTC;  
3. 50.000 BTC, Mar 2015.
so, if it was ~144.000 BTC seized, there's only ~14.344 left afther this, 3rd auction.
I now see Draper has won 2.000 BTC inthe second aution as well, so any info on who got the other 48.000? at what prices?
EDIT 2, added winners.

ok, I've had a question for some time already - if I have a  hardware wallet (Trezor) which is already set up, can I connect it to Electrum or I have to reset my Trezor and set them both up simultaneously?
@_date: 2015-03-16 08:50:12
what do they mean in the open market? like in bitstamp or kraken?
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:14:58
do I have to go through all [this]( wanting Electrum to support trezor? sorry, not feeling comfortamble not understanding what I'm doing with my coins and wallets.
