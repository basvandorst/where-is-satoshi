Physics is linked in via mining &amp; the fact that proof of work is the only proven solution to the incentive structure that maintains the bitcoin network. Information theory in a very unstrict definition, is the observation that information itself has certain properties, when combined with bitcoins transaction structure, new ways to look at said information emerges. Crytography is also related to information theory in that numbers have certain properties as well, which also serves to maintain the network. You can add finance and behavioural economics into it as well. Its no wonder it has captured the societies imagination, so many things can be projected onto it about what it actually is.

Bitcoin is the intersection of physics, information theory, and finance. Nobody knows.

There is a better way of looking at this. 
Ask yourself, should engaging in a transaction be permissioned by anyone? Maybe I dont like your coffee purchase and I (As your permissioner) do not allow you too engage in commerce, or maybe me and my buddies made it prohibitively expensive for you to do so.
If replicating your coffee purchase w/ big blocks and lots of miners across 10,000 nodes is worth the cost of a permissionless system then it is worth the technical and electrical overhead. If you think its ok to have a permissioned system why bitcoin? you have a plethora of more efficient  options already scaled such as VISA/Mastercard/Paypal etc.

Is it a good idea to write down the history of the world into things called books? Why bother with dictionaries? we can pass on our language by the fire every equinox. (sarc)
We are still in a technological dark age, use your imagination.

Are these the bitcoins they stole from the mining operation in the empty swimming pool.
