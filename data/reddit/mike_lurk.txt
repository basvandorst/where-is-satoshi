Hey thanks for replying. I posted there as well already. I’m not only looking for info related to XLM. Any relevant discussion about the potential impact of the LN on the other cryptos would be appreciated. If a lot of them usually follow in BTC trend, do people think this will inverse if the LN is successfully implemented?

lol sorry I thought I hit reply to what someone commented on my original post- 
Hey guys. I’m new to this  and am considering investing in XLM . I wanted to ask for some opinions on what kind of impact you think the (potential?) eventual launch of the bitcoin lightning network will have on stellar and what it is trying to do. If bitcoin is able to get rid of the high transaction fees and long wait times by using the lightning network to circumvent the block chain, then won’t this have a negative impact on most other cryptos? Forgive me if my understanding is rudimentary, I’m trying to learn.
