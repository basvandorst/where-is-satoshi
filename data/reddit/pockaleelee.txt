It was in a changetip account. I had planned to buy btc 2 years ago, and didn't, but got a few changetips. I wanted set up a wallet, and the same day got a notification that changetip was shutting down. Motivated me to do it!
@_date: 2016-12-23 22:52:09
Buy and hold, play around with a little.
@_date: 2016-12-29 14:16:28
I used the breadwallet QR code to send btc to my Trezor. Problem solved, I think. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:56:45
Well, it is nearly time to flip the calendar. Maybe that's exactly what he meant. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 12:58:13
Amazing - I am nearly 60 and never thought of that until now. How the hell did we tolerate that?  I have started buying btc, and see it as the future for my son.
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:50:09
So I get a seed during the setup, after I update firmware? Makes sense, but I want to be sure before I start. Thanks!
@_date: 2016-12-23 23:10:19
I just want to ensure if I die my son can access them.
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:24:34
Rule  The seat stays up when not in use.
@_date: 2017-01-02 19:06:34
Yes, I can.   
Will I? That's another question.
@_date: 2016-12-24 11:49:15
I should probably also buy some btc for my son and get him used to using it - he just turned 16. Also get him used to holding it!
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:09:44
You make some good points. Yeah, I guess I might have come off as dissing technical writers, but I guess I mean more that I could write the same thing in plain language. On the other hand, I only *think* I could. Someone else actually had to write it.   
I actually have more than $25 now, and have some money set aside to buy if it drops (instead of going to the bar money, not retirement funds) and I may start a recurring purchase each week for about $25
@_date: 2016-12-28 22:46:37
$119 on Amazon
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:00:35
One of the things I seem to see (and this is of course my opinion) is that people who are technically 'smart' rarely write in a way that is easy to understand or that makes complex things 'seem simple'. After I bought and loaded my $25 worth of btc (I'm new, don't judge me) to my Trezor, I thought, " I could write a better explanation or walk-through of how to use this than I have read anywhere" 
@_date: 2016-12-12 01:41:08
Maybe he has so many bitcoin, they won't all fit in one wallet. His wallet's *FAT!*

Ok, so I have a breadwallet on my iPhone. I think I'll order a Trezor and store some btc on that. I also have a new in the box iPhone 5 - could I use that for an offline wallet? 
@_date: 2016-12-29 12:24:31
A will, a safe, a way.  
I will leave my son my Trezor. I am introducing him to btc as I gain knowledge, so he will be familiar with it. I think I'll get him his own Trezor next Christmas. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:01:53
Huh, well, one more thing I can learn when I have time...
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:16:46
So I can load my btc on them, and hand them off to someone else? 
@_date: 2016-12-26 13:52:14
I set up a BreadWallet, and have a little bit of btc in it- less than $100. It keeps offering to import private key. As far as I know, I don't have one. How do I get one, and do I take a picture to import it?  
 I also set up a Coinbase account but the amounts they deposited "do not match" each time I enter them. Support at Coinbase is no help.  
I ordered a Trezor, so I may be back with more dumb questions when it arrives  
Finally, if I *were* to cash in some btc, where does the  money go to? 
@_date: 2016-12-28 21:32:10
Yeah, I'm just feeling kind of stupid about the changetips I passed up. Live and learn!
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:07:20
I bought a Trezor today - so my hardware wallet cost me more than I have in btc. I guess that's a commitment, right?
@_date: 2016-12-29 01:35:10
Well, I wanted some for the past few years. I actually declined some changetips before, because I had no idea *how* to do anything. I finally accepted some - about $4 worth. I recently got read that changetip was shutting down. I was on break (I work about 12 hours a day, and am a single parent with full custody, and no family for hundreds of miles. There's little 'freetime') so I decided to set up a wallet, and move them. I tried coinbase but couldn't verify the amounts. I then set up a breadwallet, and sent them there. I did finally get coinbase going, too. I like the *idea* of btc, that's what first got me interested. No, I *love it*. I also started teaching tech to 6th graders and like to show them whatever new things I can. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 21:32:55
offline hardware wallet to securely store bitcoin. Very highly recommended everywhere I read about btc.
@_date: 2016-12-23 22:54:07
I guess I should also consider keeping a copy of my key in my will, maybe, since I am old. Yes? No? 
@_date: 2016-12-25 01:16:42
Nope, it is helping me learn. They did give me a 12 word phrase which i wrote down on paper. Can I move my btc to say, a Trezor, if I buy one and plug it in to my phone? So that my btc is totally offline? 
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:17:27
Well, I do have that $4K tax refund coming...
@_date: 2016-12-29 12:25:07

@_date: 2016-12-30 00:53:10

@_date: 2016-12-24 22:49:42
Thanks for your input.
@_date: 2016-12-24 09:37:10
Well, if you have BTC, do you just want to have them gone when you die? 
@_date: 2016-12-25 01:20:49
Do they come with a cable to plug in to the phone  when I buy them? If not, how do I know what I need? 
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:34:50
How do you store your Trezor? 
@_date: 2016-12-29 01:47:28
I wrote it down, had my son verify them. (I'm thinking of getting him a Trezor with some btc for next Christmas) Unfortunately, I just happened to buy when the price is high. I am thinking of getting the seed for my Trezor and my breadwallet engraved on a piece of steel, or using my own engraver. Do you know, specifically, what cable I need (if it is possible) to connect my Trezor to my iPhone?

ChangeTip was what brought me to looking at btc. I own a tiny bit, but I am getting there. Sounds like a good way to help introduce people to bitcoin. Who doesn't like free money? 
@_date: 2019-10-17 08:01:45
I'm almost 60, and I broke down and sold half mybtc to payoff my house. I'm going to be buying again soon, and I'll leave it to my one child.

@_date: 2016-11-24 23:17:00
I don't own any bitcoin, yet. Can someone explain what this is/how this works and if/why I should buy one?
@_date: 2016-12-28 01:52:54
I don't see how trying to make a quick buck correlates with this statement: You will also be most likely to lose your Bitcoin in an exchange hack or forget your private key.  
Can you explain please?
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:41:31
Yeah, I put off buying for a long time because I was intimidated. 
My god! down .91% for the day! *I'm ruined!!*   
I buy both silver and now btc to hold...er, HODL for the long long term. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 23:22:46
Thanks for the advice. My Trezor arrived, and I set it up and moved some of my btc to it.  Hell,  if I knew it was this easy I'd have bought some long ago. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 11:47:51
Well, I thought I'd buy $1,000 and add $100 every payday.
@_date: 2016-12-28 01:24:48
I think an old address still works, but someone please correct me if I am wrong.
@_date: 2016-12-29 01:55:34
Thanks. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 14:19:53
I tried to set up a coinbase account - got 2 small deposits, and tried them in both order, yet Coinbase says those amounts do not match. Any idea what to do next? I'm now locked out for 24 hours., damn it.

@_date: 2017-11-10 01:22:15
You forgot: Is it too late to get in to bitcoin? and Is not a good time to buy or should I wait? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:48:14
No. I think that $5 will inspire him to *choose* to put more in as he earns money. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:49:59
That one was a donation fron another Redditor. He will not be buying $5 at a time!
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:49:45
If it falls $3000, just hodl on.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:51:32
It was a donation from another Redditor, so my son's actual investment is zero at this point.

Don't gamble with more than $1,000 or so. Read every link, post ,  shill, sidebar, and sub you can find. Watch videos. *Learn* about crypto before you do much of anything. Tell me, how would you feel if you bought $40,000 worth of BTC, LTC., ETH, or alts, and tomorrow it was worth only $25,000?

@_date: 2017-11-16 00:32:38
Thanks. I know BTC can take wild swings, both up and down, but he was given a little, and now said over Christmas he'd like to talk to me about cryptos. I don't own much, but I'd like to get him some more btc, maybe a couple alts, just to hodl.

No, I think it will stay at 100,000 Satoshis to one bitcoin.

First bar graph doesn't tell what the bars stand for.   
When listing by age, a color gradient for each level might be more quickly read and understood. For example, light blue getting darker as the age goes up.   
Also, IMO questions like "How much fiat currency have you used on Bitcoin? (Estimate USD)" would be better if put in order of dollar amount.

WHoo-hoo! I'm almost 60, I have a teenage son, and NONE of my friends have the slightest interest in bitcoin, or any crypto. My house is close to paid off, I have a pension and 403(b) but I like the excitement of the idea, and hope I live long enough to see it truly moon. I plan on leaving all I can to my son. Then he can HODL for his son.  
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:05:27
No, not asking for a price prediction, but what amount you think a person should have in BTC for the future. Or even, what goal do *you* have for an amount  you want to have and Hodl.
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:11:29
I have BTC which was on a Trezor from before the August fork. How do I split it? In layman's terms, please, I don't really know much about crypto. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:45:14
No. I need a good dip!
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:09:04
Bitcoin is like digital money, but nobody controls it all, *especially* banks and governments.   
Open an account on coinbase.com. Get verified. Buy a little.

@_date: 2018-07-06 20:25:19
**How much BTC should a person have?** OK, apart from... "as much as you can get".
If BTC does become what we hope, what amount would, do you think, be enough to make a major difference in a person's life? Not lambos, just no financial worries. Assume you bought or have BTC now, and are looking 10 years down the road.
@_date: 2018-07-06 21:22:34
This would be great, if it works out that way! 
@_date: 2015-04-25 21:54:07

If they bought BTC, and HODL, is it still a fleecing?

Put in 5K, sell when you have a profit. If it drops, HODL!

No, but I have an old IRA with about 6K I'd like to put in a "Crypto" IRA, not just a BTC one.
@_date: 2017-05-23 09:09:45
I'd ask why did you wait? If you are afraid to lose your money, don't. Buy, and hold. There will be ups and downs. You can also consider other cryptos. Don't put in money you can't afford to lose. If you are spending  say $2,000, you could buy BTC, or get $500 worht of BTC, ETH, LTC, GNT or whatever your rersearch tells you. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:59:58
I used Poloniex because they had a variety of coins I wanted, and it was easy to do. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:27:14
No offense. See the comment by That's what I did. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 09:57:27
I don't know. No one I know can predict the ups and downs. But I do know if you hold long term, whenever you can buy is a good time to buy. I bought a little bit at $700. I also bought Golem a week ago (six days, actually) using Exodus, and I put $450 in. It is worth $830 today. I like BTC, but I also put a little bit in some other cryptos, because I don't know enough about BTC or any other one to put all my money on just one. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:01:10
Nothing.

No, that's not what I am talking about. I have the seed in several safe places. I didn't lose any coins. When I plug my Trezor in, it shows the balance without a PIN, but only for the BTC wallet. I think. I just had to use the pin and opened the LTC wallet. Yes, is is my Trezor..

Can you tell me this - I read a lot about bitcoin on reddit but want to find a step by step guide on how to buy bitcoin. I consider myself a "bitiot" - bitcoin idiot because I can't figure out what to do. Suggestions? I'd like to get maybe $100 worth of btc and get used to how it works. Yes, I'm an idiot, but I like the idea of why and how to use it! 
@_date: 2017-07-27 01:16:38
Yeah, it is late and I missed that. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:26:15
