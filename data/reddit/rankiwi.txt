Sorry but you are overqualified to make an exchange. Making an exchange is an easy task that can be done in 1-2 weekends, with another weekend here and there sorting out support issues and fine-tuning things. Just make sure you include a clause in your T&amp;C that removes all liability for coins in the event of hacking/bugs.

If you've used Coinbase before the $10k transaction then it's very very likely to go through. Banks deduce that if you paid someone x days ago and no complaints then in future that account should be considered much more trustworthy.

I downvoted you, you're a muppet.

What about the account code that they give you and specifically tell you to include in the transfer reference? it's normally like MX3948348342Z or something.

I replied to you in the other thread. It's pretty clear to anyone with even a mild understanding of technology that it's a problem on your end and they are not actively 'blocking' you. That's why you're getting downvoted.

Man those posts make me want to punch him. Just reeking of smugness thinking he's thought of everything. It's a shame that other people are paying for his lapses.

Yup, sounds like OP is the one at fault here and screaming selective scamming.
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:56:20
You bring up a good point though... I wonder what kind of security the FBI is placing around it. I mean, think how far banks go to guard $100 million. And even then that can be tracked/traced to a large degree. If you had $100 million of literally untraceable money, what kind of safeguards would you put around it to keep it safe?
Also, out of curiosity does anyone know what the maximum prison sentence would be for stealing $100 million? Say you stole it, got 20 years in federal pound me in the ass prison, then came out. Assuming you didn't give the coins back, you'd probably come out being a multi-billionaire.
Although then again 20 years is a long time and it could be that by the time you get out some new (far superior) cryptocurrency has taken over.

I'm sure the majority of that $100 million was being used to fund beef jerkey purchases.

In my opinion they make their verification requirements **very** clear, it's all on display before you send it in. I'm guessing you didn't read, then kick up a stink when front-line support monkeys don't accept it.
PS: You can get around it by printing, then scanning your bill. That's what I did.

Hi, 
I want to make it clear that I am not the same person who lost bitcoins. I haven't lost anything, not a single bitcoin. I have everything turned off and sandboxed when I visit any website. I just put the warning out there because I knew some others would fall for it. Looks like someone did and now everyone is linking to my thread (which is cool I guess). But yeah maybe shoot the guy a message on bitcointalk or something.

Disclaimer: I had a minor delay in a support ticket once and contacted the CEO to get it sorted. He sorted everything within 10 minutes. I did my research before using them and the company is pretty damn legit. [Here are all their documents, which can be verified as real]( I've continued to use OKPay without problems.
It sounds to me like you really don't know what you are talking about and you're a bit out of your depth technically speaking.
I have the following questions:
1. Have you opened up a support ticket with them? 
2. How long ago did you open that support ticket?
In your other thread you say this:


What exactly did you do? And don't you think it shows they are legit by allowing you to move your funds around as you want?
 
Now, on to your accusations of them blocking you, there's a number of different reasons why you could've been blocked. If you're on a dynamic IP then someone else could've gotten that IP blocked before. Or a false alarm on the Web Application Firewall if you are doing funky shit (which it sounds like you were). But that doesn't make sense because you say:


That doesn't make any sense at all. They blocked you and in one browser it displays a blank page, in another browser it does something completely different? If they're going to block you, they would block you in one uniform way, not messing around with blocking individual browsers. 
Now, the fact that you get "some generic ad site" gives me the impression that it is a problem on your end, possibly adware/spyware or possibly a problem with your DNS. If you use the tor browser bundle then your DNS requests are also routed through the network, which would explain why it loads fine in tor and why it doesn't on your own computer. 


It is standard practice for many websites to automatically block tor nodes. The scan is usually done when contact is first made with the website. So you go to okpay, OKpay scans the exit node and determines it's an exit node, then automatically blocks it. No one is "sitting there blocking your IP", it's such an insanely ridiculous accusation that it makes my head explode.
Let's not be quick to kill a legit business with a little tantrum over nothing. 
TLDR; you're probably infected with [something similar to this.]( Not necessarily the one I linked, but something along those lines.

This idea is about 20 years old. There's major issues in doing it, hence why it hasn't succeeded yet. Slapping "bitcoin" in front of it doesn't make it a "killer app". 
In fact I want to repeat that for all the wantrepreneurs: Slapping "Bitcoin" in front of an old idea does not mean success. Be innovative.

Pretty sure he meant it in appreciation.

but AFAIK mtgox doesn't let you set the transaction fee yourself?

I'm not a lawyer but I would **strongly** advise talking to one before embarking on a new venture. Bitcoin is likely going to put you into grey territory.

It's called [Arbitrage]( The problems with this scenario are:
* Fee for wire transfer
* Fee for intermediary bank fees
* Fee for depositing to BTC-e
* Fee for purchasing BTC @ BTC-e
* Fee for withdrawing BTC @ BTC-e and sending to [insertplace]
* Fee for selling BTC @ [insertplace]
* Fee for withdrawing @ [insertplace]
* Any currency conversion fees if applicable (eg sending overseas)
And biggest of all:
* Money tied up with wire transfers 2-4 days in, 2-4 days out. 
Worth it for 4.4%? I think not.

The coins themselves would be the hardest to track. I was more meaning the actual break-in itself. You'd be surprised how often people are caught even when they are behind proxies located in non-cooperative third countries. There's a number of ways to do it.

Go Btc-e --&gt; Finances --&gt; USD --&gt; Deposit -&gt; International Wire Transfer
Then if you scroll down you will see "Details of Payment:", It's underneath "Bank SWIFT" and above "Fee". The details of payment will include among other things account code. Did you include that as-is?
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:26:41
What is your background?
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:56:30


That implies that you were able to login and send the funds? 
Just so we are clear, you think they decided to block access to your account by IP instead of by actually locking/freezing your account/funds?
And you also think someone was manually sitting there blocking your IP each time you logged in from a new tor node?
Contrary to popular belief, using Linux doesn't make you an expert or smart. In this case it makes you a 37 year old wannabe who doesn't have a clue. It's clearly a technical problem, not a scam.


[Yeah, sure you did.](

With enough visibility and demand, it's possible. A good example is LulzSec. It's arguable how much monetary damage they truly caused but they were caught nonetheless.

1. While I'm not a fan of Zend, it's not a piece of crap.
2. Butterfly labs had exception printing enabled (bad).
3. Butterfly labs stored username/pass in the file itself (bad). Industry standard is to put the details into a separate file outside your webroot, then include that file. This stops situations where it might get printed (eg httpd serving up php as plain text instead of php, or exception printing etc).
The blame for this rests solely with butterflylabs. Thank god they don't run an exchange.

If we want Bitcoin to succeed in the real-world, then a big part of that will be Merchants accepting Bitcoin. But we can't wait around for a few minutes waiting for confirmations, so most Merchants will accept on 0/unconfirmed. So how on earth are we going to minimize race attacks? It's just a matter of time before this becomes a serious problem imo.
