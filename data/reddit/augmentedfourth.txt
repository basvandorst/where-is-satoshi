I've said it before, but I think the potential for micro-transactions is *grossly* underestimated.
One aspect that often gets overlooked is how adding a cost-factor to peoples decision-making process, even a seemingly minuscule amount, provides informational value, reduces "noise" and enhances quality in markets. Cryptocurrencies will make it *much easier* to charge for content. Even if those charges are fractions of a penny, which still makes it almost free for the end-user, the changes could be enormous.
When things are completely free, people (and bots) consume them rampantly and without consideration. Robust, transparent and "frictionless" microtransactions would introduce market forces, adding value to the information ecosystem without pricing individuals out.

Don't hate. I see where you're going with this. However, he's a excellent disseminator of ideas between disparate groups of people. 
I've been on the psychedelic bandwagon (for lack of a better term) for longer than Rogan has been big. However, the good parts/ideas of that culture have oft been dismissed outright as its usually lumped together with ultra-left-wing, hippy, newage, crystals, etc...
I think he's able to expose people to a lot of cool new ideas and ways of thought who otherwise might not have if it was coming from some long-bearded wizard hippy. 
Furthermore, he often takes a more libertarian slant which is not the norm for those who delve into the topic of psychedelics. (Which I think is merely a social artifact from the 60s)

I just think that people don't really know/care that "ponzi scheme" has a real and objective meaning. (ie. Madoff, possibly Herbalife, etc..) Instead they use it as a catchall term any time they are trying to describe the "greater fool theory". The latter, while a valid opinion, is completely subjective.

Really? 
Sure, the IRS will take anything that you give 'em. It's just like with sales tax for internet purchases. Nobody is reporting and they have no way of spotting those transactions. (at least currently)
Sure, capital gains on trading activity but reporting gains for good purchased?! That seems overly cautious to me.

Price is an imperfect mechanism for transmitting information. However, it is very efficient and *despite* it's imperfections, its absence causes all sorts of side effects. For one simplistic example of missing prices and broken markets, just look at the US healthcare system.

Maybe a little OT, but does anyone else think that this reality, in-and-of-itself, is a perfect example of how tenuous the global economy really is when it relies on a relatively small number of large institutions?!
"A insular group of like-minded people with similar skills and backgrounds who distrust information from outside sources and remain isolated from the most negative effects of their decisions? Yeah, it sounds we should put those guys in control of an infinitely complex dynamic system!"

I disagree. I think user acceptance of paywalls will increase dramatically if bitcoin can provide a "friction-less" micro (or even nano) payment system.
Even &lt;$0.01 per-click charges have a potential for dramatically changing the landscape of content online, for better and potentially worse. However, it *will* put more power back into the hands of content creators and possibly provide better incentives for quality in both creation and delivery.
Think about it: Even a minuscule transaction-free would prevent some large-scale scraping and repackaging bots. In turn, it could also help to improve the quality of search by reducing duplication of content and improving metrics of measuring content quality.
In other words: **Market-based pricing carries informational value!**
When everything is completely free, you lose out on some critical meta-data. Even with a really, really low price you force individuals to engage in decision-making that would not otherwise occur.

Yeah, I do think the impact of this ETF on the bitcoin market will hinge on how it is structured. I don't know too much about the inner-workings of these things to be entirely sure of anything. However, I expect that it will have to consist almost entirely of actual bitcoin holdings. I don't think that sufficient options/futures/derivatives markets exist with bitcoin to have any substantial value to an ETF.
 
Also, don't you think that one of the big reasons that they are able to play shell-games with Commodities is due to the overhead involved with physical delivery and storage? With BTC there is no excuse not to hold them directly or to allow customers to take delivery. Plus, it's all above-the-table on the blockchain. It think it might be much harder to play paper games with.

Clarification: Its called "fiat" because a gvt. has declared its value by decree. Fiat basically means "because we say so". In other words it is  backed by faith in that government not some tangible asset.

I'm sure the argument could be made for both sides. I'm not an "expert" but I think that at this stage in bitcoin's existence that it would be a very good thing. It would add a lot more liquidity to the bitcoin market by providing a simple vehicle that retail/average-joe investors could use to access the bitcoin market. It basically opens up bitcoin to *retirement accounts* which is HUGE. Furthermore, that style of investment, "buy and hold", should do even more to balance out the volatility caused by frenetic trading.

Not really, that is an interstate commerce issue. However, the Federal Government (Justice Dept.) has made public statements indicating that their non-interference hinges upon the states ability to keep cannabis within it's borders, among other things. So CO has a clear incentive to make sure that it doesn't happen. In fact, the rules and regs that have been adopted for commercial distribution and production directly address those questions.
In short, no you can't legally send it out of the state.

That's why it should probably be paid for in the "future" with a devaluing currency! (ie. financed in USD)
It surprises me that almost everyone in these threads assumes a mining business model that involves equipment "paid in full"! If you want and expect the value of BTC to rise (against x denomination) in the future, *WHY* would you pay for it now!? (Assuming you can borrow the money at a good interest rate)

There is a certain amount of intrinsic value in its utility and infrastructure/network for sure. 
Besides, value is subjective. Anything that serves as a store of wealth relies on your ability to trade/convert it (ie. What its worth to someone else)

Investment advice, just like investing, is a two-sided coin. You know what's a lot worse than feeling bad about *not* giving good advice? Giving bad advice! Worse, since you don't have any control over how your friends/family act on your advice, they could mess it all up trying to time the market and still lose! ( So even if you don't get blamed directly, you're still sorta implicated.)
I don't like to try and give investment advice to anyone that I know is inexperienced. When I do, I always try to make a LOT of disclaimers. (ie. I'm not an expert and you better do a ton of research!) 
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:35:29
Just don't fool your yourself into thinking that it was anything other than luck!
In other words, don't try to start trading. If anything, accumulate on dips and take *some* profits on spikes. If you're only playing with one 1BTC you don't have much room for error, which can be a good or a bad thing!

It's just a self-directed retirement account with tax-advantages. As far as "control" goes, they can be as open as any trading account allowing you to access almost any market.

I would expect that mined bitcoins would be taxed just like any profit-generating business. Taxes would be calculated based on the profit: total value of bitcoins sold minus operating expenses and any deductions. It might get a little more complicated than that if, for instance, you re-invest the mined coins or allow them to appreciate instead of converting. Those strategies might allow you to only pay capital-gains taxes...
I'm not a tax professional or accountant though...so I could be way off!

What does that even mean? "Value" is completely subjective....unless you're a Marxist, of course! ;)

The fact of the matter is, to most people computers are *pure magic*. As a programmer, it seems ridiculous and frustrating that people can't grasp or understand the potential that we're trying to convey. However, many of these people are incapable* of truly understanding or or reaching these conclusions on their own. They must ultimately rely on faith, and that faith comes only comes with popular consensus.

There aren't any major technical flaws or big security concerns with the TOR protocol itself. However, just like any other tool it remains up to the individual user to use it properly.
The NSA can (and probably does) control or access a relatively-small number of TOR routers. These "compromised" nodes, while not able to provide them an identity, could give them enough information to pattern-match a TOR user to an individual on the regular internet. Say, someone is using TOR on the same browser session that they used to browse the internet and sign into facebook or gmail.
It's kinda like if someone wearing a bright red ballcap and a mask goes to rob a bank. The mask won't do anything for them if they forget to take off the hat afterwards!

Damn! What credit union is this?! How much money do you have on deposit? Because that is a absurd return for a checking or savings account.


Almost all free credit/debit cards charge at least a 1% foreign transaction fee. Also, credit cards definitely *aren't* free to use. Global retail prices are basically 2-4% higher than they need to be in order to absorb Visa/MC/AMEX processing fees. Retailers are almost REQUIRED to accept credit-cards in order to compete these days and in the end the cost is passed along to the consumer. Obviously, bitcoin isn't going to change that overnight. However, it does speak to the problem.
