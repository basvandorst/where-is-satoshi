wow, I was stunt by huge amount of quality comments here which I didn't expect.
My initial point was just to let new joiners in the community of bitcoins, and other altcoins understand that if you don't know about the tech, the capability of bitcoin and blockchain (sorry kinda cooperative!) with the freedom they brought, if you just come to make more money, it is not really the scheme we can see here (aka Ponzi).
For sure Bitcoin is (and always) having the issues technical and political ones, but, since we believe in consensus, we believe in the world of freedom, anonymity, and privacy. And, in Bitcoin core I do trust!
