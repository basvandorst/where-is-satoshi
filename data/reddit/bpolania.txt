That the price is over $200 again makes me happy for many reasons, but one important is seeing Matt Obrien eat his words

This makes me think about how could eventually banks influence the price if it ever comes to a point where it becomes a problem for them, since they have a lot of dollars they just can buy when it gets really low and dump when it gets uncomfortably high, they would be acting somehow as a de facto central bank and implement de facto monetary policy.
Right now, if they wanted they price to rise they could just start a buying spree... so it seems that after all there's a way to have power over the price of a decentralized currency...

That's the whole point, volatility will cause that market cap will drop regularly, right now at $3.4B market cap is a third of (for example) SnapChat's valuation, that amount of money is peanuts for big economies like US or China.
Let's say that Bitcoins becomes an issue for big countries, even at a 340B market cap (100 times as today) market cap would be less than 1% of the combined OECD countries GDP, so they just can gather and buy as much bitcoins as they want with little effort, manipulating the market to a point where they can influence the price and implement a de facto monetary policy.

People will declare bitcoins income if it becomes illegal not to declare it, currently unless you get an audit, any inconsistency will go undetected, but reality is that most of Americans declare what they have to, but some will hide some incomes or deduce something they shouldn't.
Now, the main problem is, for bitcoins become mainstream you need big companies involved, these companies or high-income individuals just won't risk to get in trouble with the IRS and declare what they legally have to declare, whether bitcoins gains or capital gains from investments in the stock market.
Now, it won't be Coinbase, it would be any US-based bitcoin exchange, and if these were to disappear it would be a huge problem for bitcoin, specially if we want it to become a universally accepted currency.
I don't think that bitcoin's raison d'être should be tax avoidance. Decentralization competitive advantage is value stability over time, no anarchist utopia, a world where taxes can be paid with bitcoins would be preferable to one where people buy bitcoins to avoid taxes.

Well, if you are an American it doesn't matter whether the transaction happens in the US or not. On the other hand it's not clear if bitcoins can or will be classified as "financial instruments", so it's hard to know if this tax would eventually make all bitcoins transactions taxable.
Also, US government can make exchanges to pay for the tax, let's say Coinbase, it can charge the tax for each transaction and then pay the tax to the government as a VAT.
In short, you don't need a magic wand to enforce this tax on US citizens and companies, just a little imagination.

This is an interesting question, besides the technical considerations, the main benefit of being decentralized is that no single entity can influence the money supply. The most recent fall in price showed that it could be possible for a single entity can implement de facto monetary policy by buying or selling huge amounts of coins in short periods of time. Also, this entity could use bitcoins to back securities, creating an artificial supply of cryptocurrency. 
And this doesn't even have to be a single entity, one per country would do the trick, imagine Decentralized Easing, governments printing money to buy bitcoins, they can easily take control of the market since governments have significantly more purchasing power than people and most of the companies. They can also make people to pay bitcoin related income in bitcoins.  
All these will of course push the bitcoin price up, and when it gets too high the government can easily dump as many coins they need to bring it down, acting in fact as a central authority for bitcoin.
So, in short, technology itself doesn’t guarantees decentralization.

Decentralized rich-men retreat?

I think the main obstacle right now is that buyers doesn't have a real incentive in using bitcoins, the push must come from sellers, they'd benefit the most from reducing the use of cash, they just need to transfer some of the benefit to customers somehow, like small discounts for bitcoin buyers.
Not only that, this would be a better way for dispensaries to find financing, investors can lend bitcoins instead of cash coming out of banks accounts, soothing some of the fears traditional financial institutions have.
I guess I should be callling some of my friends in Boulder about this...

Club-Med Punta Cana? I mean, that's an all-inclusive resort for families...not sure about the Bilderberg-Style...
@_date: 2015-02-02 20:37:38
ouch! I guess I should stop taking sides until I do a more research...
@_date: 2015-02-02 20:59:13
Well, there are a lot of banks there. I hope the scuba-diving operators accept bitcoins.

Sadly you don't have much idea what you're talking about, a currency swap is the exchange of principal and interest in one currency for the same in another currency, is a financial tool used to get around exchange controls and restrictions. 
Governments don't swap currencies, they bought currencies on the markets, technically speaking they don't exchange it, because they don't use it to exchange value from one currency to another, but mostly to store value and hedge their risks.
You can say what you want about "exchange" being a better word, but it's just wishful thinking, because financial markets doesn't go by "exchanging" stuff but for buying and selling them. But in the end, is all the same, currencies are bought and sold at a exchange rate, no matter how you and me want to call it.

I'd buy a ticket!
The biggest obstacle will be legal, in most countries only states are legally authorized to run lotteries, and they're all not-for-profits. 
Now MillionaireMakers doesn't award a prize, just the right to receive a bunch of donations, which is interesting but is not a business.
That bring me to my questions, are you doing this for fun? as a business? Not-for-profit? All are valid, but if you want to make it a business let me know since I've been developing some ideas on that respect.

Bad one for Coindesk, if they want to be taken seriously, they should be confirming their sources

The "exchange" term is more associated with non-trading activities, I mean, tourists and travelers exchange their money because they use it as a medium of exchange, but when entities or individuals acquire currencies as an investment tool, they don't "exchange" currencies, they "buy" or “sell” them. 
For example, Governments and corporations don't exchange their reserves in dollars for euros: one sell Dollars and buy Yuan’s, and the other sell Yuan’s and buy Dollars, so the idea of "change the wording" seems not only unnecessary but can be even contra productive as it’s important that Bitcoin retains all the qualities that would make it a standard currency recognized and accepted by everyone.

We've been doing something similar with NFC.

Yeah... I got myself into this mess hehehe... I mean I just wanted to point the irony if CoinDesk calling it a "Bilderberg-like event" while it's being held in a regular hotel where middle-class guys can spend their holidays... then somehow evolved into something different... hehehe...
