Thanks. I might just see if I can copy that format myself and buy some fancy holographic stickers and keep the info for everyones wallets as backup in my safe in case they lose it.

I did a little more googling and believe this is going to a good resource for what I am requesting. Anyone see a security risk with that?

While I struggle with the deep technicalities of BTC, this simple fact is what emotionally keeps me attracted to it. My father in law left the soviet union in 1989 with $200 in his pocket when he emigrated. That was all he was allowed to leave with. All other possessions were turned back over to the state. When I think of his situation, I always think of how BTC could have changed his situation simply by memorizing a key as a means of retaining his wealth. I'm sure this has already happened and will continue to do so.

I guess technically there's no way to do that with cash.  And you're probably right.  If my intentions are to treat it as a gift alternative for cash, everyone involved should realize just like cash there's a possibility of loss if not handled carefully.  And therefore treat it with respect. It's an interesting thought im going to continue to mull over for the next day or two now.

I don't listen much to what he says, but its something along the lines of JP morgan is manipulating the price and as soon as that blows up his silver could go to 1000.  He's not receptive to the idea that machines and automation could make it cheaper to pull out of the ground.

I've had that thought as well. But I'm kinda hoping they lose the wallet and 20 years when I'm really rich and keep asking for money that I can throw them a bone and say, here's a backup of that wallet you lost.  Maybe $20k would be there by then and enough to get them to leave me alone.  Kind of a bright dark story.

Got any good background or source that can help me articulate that point? I've been trying to open his eyes for a while, but admittedly, i'm a network engineer, not a finance analyst so have trouble articulating these points.  I just know in this modern times, were not going to be smelting metals to pay for shit if the economy collapses.

This probably what my dad has been reading.  Converted all of their savings to silver, purchases barrels or sugar, flour, beans, etc.  Stockpiling bullets and bullshit for the end of the world thats not going to come.  Nothing is going to snap them out of this hysteria.  They're addicted to it the same way people were addicted to the crack epidemic.
