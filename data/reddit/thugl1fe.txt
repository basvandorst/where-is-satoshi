capitalist finance is, by definition, manipulating other people.
on a serious note, how do i position money *to* buy bitcoin when i want to, without converting it outright?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:35:19
Contact police, and contact ebay.  It sucks you didnt use paypal.  Both companies lean heavily in support of buyers so you might have some luck.  
What country is he in? Do you have an actual account number.  More importantly, how long has it been since you did the transaction?
@_date: 2013-03-28 04:26:40
Tor isnt anonymous-- it has a number of proven weaknesses.  Silk Road had shoddy security at the start-- why do you have confidence in it now?  Governments are already are involved in many international drug networks, so why not with bitcoin?  They could make a lot of sales and a lot of controlled deliveries (where they make you sign for it).  Raid some US based sites or maybe foreign ones just like megaupload.  We really don't have any idea how extensive the resources are of all those three letter agencies, but with hundreds of billions of dollars they might have just worked something extensive out.   As the article implies, if they can extensively ruin the confidence in the currency or its reputation then they could score a win.  Hinder wider adoption.  This could also happen because of more spectacular hacks than have already occurred.  
I also think it just might become another tool for them.  Imagine being able to send funds to insurgents while watching them attack a target with drones.  Or rioters.  We are already fighting a proxy guerrilla war in Syria, couldnt this be a technological asset in those places?  
You should really remember, they are only going to act against genuine threats.  Hence why the Bitcoin developers the other year gave a talk at the venture capital company In Q Tel, which is essentially a CIA front.  What if they're already investors?

Not really, the spread of currencies historically was always associated with military conquest.  
A great moment in history for btc will be when we see Al Qaeda insurgents being paid in btc to their cell phones while being monitored by a drone swarm.
