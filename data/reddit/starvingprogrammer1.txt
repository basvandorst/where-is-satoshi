Just want to let you know to ignore some the pompous idiots in here that think they are God's gift to Bitcoin information. You made a simple mistake that can happen to anyone. Unfortunately and luckily your event will have people like me understand the caution it takes to properly utilize Bitcoin. Sorry for your loss and hopefully btc will spike for you in the future to capitalize on.

Wait I thought her books were based on that the market WILL replace and is more sufficient than government regulation.

Looks like I get no satisfaction if you ever saw my comment or not lol

What's the point? I'd assume that it would get deactivated at anytime without KYC and you would lose funds.

People want "number go up" but with that comes "number go down". Average people don't use crypto currently for this reason as it's handled more like an investment opportunity, opposed to help daily QOL for the average person. That's why FB is trying to peg it's crypto to the USD. BTC would need to stabilize in order for it to be used like libra.
@_date: 2019-06-22 22:24:29
Accept Libra and get rid of the rest. (Lol)

It's it possible to contribute with a raspi as a node, only plugging it in during nights when I sleep or is it kinda pointless? Just out of curiosity.

Post it for us :)

Get an external HDD reader. It hooks up your old HD to your PC via USB. Very simple!

Perfect gif lol

It's how I keep up with the trends lol

I wish this hit the front page of Reddit.

What do you mean geofenced the US? As in you can or can't use it in the USA?
@_date: 2019-06-18 20:03:05
Sorry to disappoint you but the average user wouldn't know the difference. It's posing as a crypto and will be a competitor. It's trying to mimic a stable coin.
@_date: 2019-06-18 22:21:55
Call my node a prune one more time and see what happens....

As a self professed Suckerberg hater, comparing these two together makes me want to unsubscribe from r/bitcoin 
I'm what world do we compare someone that puts innocent lives in danger via a poorly redacted data dump compare to the disgusting ways of Facebook?
That being said, lock them both up.
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:07:20
Yeah.. there's no way. Wishful thinking though.

Wait, is it?

I'm jealous of your username!

Thank you for apologizing. It shows class, which is rare on Reddit.   
I am with you in sentiment. I want btc to rise and be seen as a legitimate currency.  
I don't see be adopted from any first world countries as they would lose power. Look at John Stossell's video on the Federal Reserve. They don't just create money but actually dictate currency rules near arbitrarily. Other countries like Russia have the same sort of system. Russia's currency is backed by multiple things like gold, bonds, as well as basically their word. They would lose a lot of power (and manipulative power) to go decentralized.  
What I could see more realistically happening is that a powerful entity would create a centralized crypto and have it use the blockchain and help bolster btc indirectly. That's if they use the blockchain at all.  
Really I'm just speculating off videos of more informed people I watched over the years and conversations I've had.   
I think for btc to really have a chance it's going to have to have a real grass roots movement to it and have people stop looking at it like an investment. That's where the last bubble came from and left a sour taste in a lot of people's mouths. We'll see. On this one I hope I'm proved wrong and bitcoin will blast off out of control so governments can't get ahead of it. Thoughts?
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:34:05
Bitcoin itself would be against it's interest as they lose some control. I could definitely see them using the blockchain. There are already banks that use Bitcoin and one of them is called Coinbase. They suck with all the kyc laws which all banks have to abide by in the US. In order to make btc a good investment for them they would have to charge high fees and use smart contracts for their businesses which is hard to implement. 
I'll entertain your snide question.. It's just a username, don't think it so hard. Secondly, I'm still in school learning programming.
@_date: 2019-05-05 05:35:25
So does that make Coinbase the dumbest SJW?
