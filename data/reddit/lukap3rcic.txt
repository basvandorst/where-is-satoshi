Can we get doxxed Junseth some juicy death threats? Tell him where on earth he shouldn't appear anymore (Minnesota is already taken, don't repeat that one)
@_date: 2017-02-17 10:35:22
nah because he is wearing a suit and because he is a jew
@_date: 2017-02-17 10:34:10
wearing the suit without the irony looks really bad

It's not just Chris that thinks that. He is an idiot, so it wouldn't count much anyway.

Only people who drain their channels would need to open a new one. They can open bigger one next time (so it would last them longer). There would be some need to reconfigure the paths but i suspect that only one out 10-100 would need to reopen the channel to enable efficient hoops. Best topology is a mystery and needs to be tested before any good predictions could be made.

You might like ZeroPass 
It's not yet done, but key recovery works with 2 out of 3 trusted contacts providing enough key material to recover the keys. You can always block them from getting your "file" (password slot) if you are still alive, though :)

Working on the (decentralised) private key recovery service.
Me might overused shamir secret sharing a bit ^_^

We are building ZeroPass, that plans to work like virtual tpm (it uses devices tpm-s for second factor to the server). ; 
Basically, you leave half of the private key (shamir secret sharing split) on the server, half on your machine. When you request it, server checks if you have 2 factor (tpm) signatures. If yes, it sends you half of the key back for you to sign.
Later we hope to add multisig so that first signatures get signed as described above, the second one on the server (if your devices leak key-material, you would still be safe).
