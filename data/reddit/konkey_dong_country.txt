So, are you prompted to create the seed words when you plug the hardware wallet into a PC?

Sure, any corporation can  *seem* like they have their shit together, but they may not. There's too many ways a company can be hacked or breached these days. Look at Equifax, now NiceHash, hell even PlayStation Network was taken down for over a month a few years ago. Even the best network engineers can miss something, and the bad guys are always finding a new way. I'm a network admin myself and I am looking into these hardware wallets, etc. It's all a steep learning curve for me so far...

The two hardware wallets I see mentioned in here are all in Euros or not in the US. Is there anything state-side I could look into?

I've been reading supposed ELI5s on this whole thing, been reading this thread, and I still can't quite wrap my head around it or figure out what I should do. The ELI5's are more all like ELI-a computer scientist.

The problem also is profits = freedom.

Can anyone tell me what this is from?

Thanks for the clarification! I keep buying BTC, but am not day trading. That would get far too stressful for me, not to mention the extra tax work I'd have to do.

And in [this thread]( people are saying to avoid blockchain. WELL WHO TF DO I TRUST?

Thanks for the thorough explanation! I feel a bit better about CB after reading that. Question: Do I have to do anything differently with taxes even if I am just holding in my CB wallet?

Because Coinbase has a really noob friendly interface, and it's easy to get started with it. Source: am noobie. What advantages does blockchain provide?
