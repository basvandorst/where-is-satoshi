Stupid question: Do most altcoins start afresh with a new genesis block or do they usually carry over Bitcoin's blockchain? Examples of both would be nice. Thanks.

I'm pretty sure this had nothing to do with blockchain/bitcoin until op realized he could get donations out of it..

Isn't the plan to never cash out?

This thread is pretty negative..

That's only useful if I know how low it's going to go before rising again, right?
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:53:02
Not the future, but I want a notification as soon as possible when it starts increasing. A service that is the equivalent of what an experienced investor can tell by looking at graphs all day.

Are you implying that it's not possible to detect when the increase is significantly more than what would be considered normal fluctuation? I would have imagined services like this would exist when so much money is on the line. (Sorry, I'm new to this whole thing.)

Will check out. Thanks

Is there a way I can be alerted when (if) the prices start rising?
Edit: Basically, I would like to know (with reasonable certainty) when the prices hit rock bottom, preferably before the sellers on lbc figure out what's going on..

Thank you
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:19:13
Thanks for info.

You already know the answer..

Withdrawal for BTC is back on Binance. Hold onto your cocks.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:26:54
Only time will tell. I'm guessing ~6 hours to see if there is a significant effect.
@_date: 2019-05-15 13:09:27
Trading on Binance has just resumed. Withdrawals will likely start soon.
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:24:58
You can't really conclude anything if they differ though.
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:52:42
Exactly. In general, people put so much blind faith in projects just because they're open source ... and then they download a binary release...
