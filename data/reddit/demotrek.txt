Don’t stress, it’s new to a lot of people but you get the hang of it. The fact you wanted to move it to a wallet is very smart. People on here are helpful and want you to succeed. I believe if you post the public key you sent to there’s a way to see where it’s at. Don’t get discouraged!!!

Wow, impressive post. Curious though, how many mg of adderall are you on?

Good luck OP, you sound like a positive dude and that’s probably the hardest part about infertility. My wife and I tried for 6 years with no luck and just had “unexplained infertility.” I’m sitting next to my 2 year old watching ELF right now and we have  in the oven! Both were successful IVF transfers and proof these things work. Who is your insurance with?? Both mine combined cost me about $50k out of pocket but of course no price tag can be put on your child. My little girl now has her own Trezor wallet with BTC that I will pass along when she’s older. Bitcoin babies!!!! You got this!!!

Gemini for BTC and ETH and Binance and Cryptopia for alts. 
Is it ok to use the word “and” 3 times in a sentence?
I’ll try 4. 
Gemini for BTC and ETH and Binance and Cryptopia for alts and fuck Coinbase.

Were the 3000 BTC purchased with fake money/tether?

Ha! My friend bought his first $200 tonight and added $1,000 more USD after that (waiting for it clear). 
It’s easy to sell things you believe in :)

The banks don’t issue refunds, they put an “authorization only” on your card which falls off a few days later. Plus credit card companies protect you more than the businesses (you spending money means they make more money from interchange). If you are ever charged for an item you did not receive you call your credit card company and issue a chargeback. At that point it’s up to the business to show proof and if they don’t you get your money back and they get hit with a chargeback. Too many chargebacks and you can be banned from ever accepting plastic at your business again.

Do you really need to ask that?

Zoom in on the receipt and you’ll see they even have a BTC graph (looks like a 6 month).

The real value is like $3600. According to everyone who owns some.
