The Internet Credit Union is a very new Credit Union. All new credit unions go through a two year probationary period (extendable to four years at the discretion of the NCUA) where the services that they are allowed to offer are limited and basic. 
Those services are enumerated in an agreement that is signed when the Credit Union is formed and can only be expanded if the NCUA officer providing oversight agrees to it. The Bitcoin services that the Internet Credit Union started providing probably exceeded the services they were authorized to provide during their probationary period, so those were stopped.
It isn't the case of "the man" beating down a Credit Union's Bitcoin activities - it is the case of "the man" holding a brand new Credit Union to a specifically restricted set of services during their probationary period.
Once the Internet Credit Union is four years old, they will be free of those chains and I fully expect them to roar. We should all look forward to good things when that happens.

You will still be able to trade your BTC.bitstamp for USD.bitstamp (or whatever your preferred counter currency is) within Ripple during the downtime. When a centralized exchange, like Bitstamp, goes down for maintenance their Ripple issues can still trade freely within Ripple's decentralized system.

There is a New Zealand Ripple gateway that will give you access to BTC: [Coinex](
Their biggest order book is NZD/XRP, but since Ripple is a decentralized exchange, you can trade that against BTC from Bitstamp, SnapSwap, Justcoin and others. They do serve as a gateway for BTC as well, it is just that until now, they have been gatewaying more NZD.
Best of all, they spent the time to get the proper licenses:
