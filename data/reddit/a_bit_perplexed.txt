Ok in agreement there. After reading up on the technology there's no doubt in my mind that within 5-10 years blockchain transactions will become ubiquitous. 
My uncertainty lies with all the hard forks and disputes over what bitcoin is/should be. 
Aside from the oft cited network effects of bitcoin, what makes you comfortable with the idea that Bitcoin is the crypto of the future and not merely paving the way for some more efficient block chain technologies?

What about the deflationary death spiral going on in Japan since the late 90s?

Thank you for taking the time to craft a well thought out response. I suppose I wasn't clear in my original comment what I was trying to convey. You are 100% correct that Japanese monetary policy under Abe has been incredibly inflationary (in intent). They were the first to go to negative rates and even considered a policy of helicopter money last year
With that being said the first post stickied on this sub has an explanation of why Bitcoin makes a good currency. But it ignores the deflationary component. As you stated, deflation incentivizes consumers to delay purchases since their currency will be worth more in the future. Why would you buy a house today with 10 bitcoin when you might be able to buy it with 5 in 6 months?
Which begs the question is bitcoin a currency or a store of value? To me it seems the answer is a store of value but with that being said I've only started educating myself on the subject a month ago
