Your screeching like a lunatic has convinced me that crypto is a stable currency I should invest in.

But what if I want to purchase something other than vap juice?

This is exactly what Trump fanatics say except you substituted some mysterious anti-crypto organization for George Soros.
I know, you're so deep in the echo chamber, you can't *conceive* that not everyone thinks like you. Despite the fact that very few people want anything to do with crypto.  
The "real value" of Bitcoin is ZERO.
In fact, less than zero because you're causing widespread ecological damage to create NOTHING.

How is it "spreading rubbish" to notice the *fact* that Bitcoin has lost more than 40% of its value in less than 2 weeks? 
Bitcoin is not a secret society and thus everyone is allowed to have opinions about it. You seem about as stable as Bitcoin, capslock-guy.

I get the feeling as an outside observer that cryptocurrency is a 50:50 mix of the same old profit-driven uber-capitalists who treat it as any other chance to get rich - and absolutely delusional cultists.    
  
There is \*no\* reason why crypto is going to make the world more egalitarian. Or make drinking water more accessible. Or solve the rioting in France.    
    
I don't respect the various flavors of amoral money-grabber, be they faux-lefty tech bros or anarcho-capitalist or just your old-fashioned conservative money-hoarder. But at least they're not kidding themselves. The people who think causing massive environmental damage, wasting vast amounts of electricity to make literally nothing, is going to bring about a utopia... those are the people I want to shake back awake. Sincerely hoping that the majority of people who talk like that are just trolls trying to pump up their own crypto holdings, because anyone who wants to make the world a better place should go feed the homeless and let the soulless rich play with their bitcoins.
