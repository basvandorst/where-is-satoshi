well maybe it wouldnt be an issue if we had bigger blocks
You can buy a hard drive, that will store an entire YEAR of full 8mb blocks, all for just over the cost of 1 avg bitcoin transaction right now
Which also means that its cheaper to store a whole year of full 8mb blocks than it is to open a single lightning channel

Yes....bigger blocks would fix this problem. Even if we went to 4mb, that means that the mempool would be cleared in about 25-30 blocks 
If the network can be crippled by ONE entity, then surely thats an issue?
Or should everyone just use a few central wallet services so that transactions can be batched and....oh wait......thats centralisation

"grrrr people are actually using bitcoin, screw them. Don't they know using bitcoin is bad for bitcoin?"
You think the visa network complains about banks "spamming" their network when their customers use their cards?

If bitcoin wasn't in a really bad state right now then people wouldn't need to even think about altcoins
I'm really sad that the second highest cap crypto-currency is a non-mineable, centralised currency.

Thats why the hardware address check button is included?
Click the Monitor Icon and it will display your REAL address on the device so you can confirm

Yes because the price didn't go anywhere near your 800-900 prediction and hasn't even hit your 1200-1600 prediction yet

Jeez the uber-cocky way that you speak, assuming you know everything about the markets, plus your cringy username....
If you knew how to predict market forces that accurately and in those long timespans, then you'd be doing much better things than being on reddit.
You cant predict the market with certainty unless you have insider information, which for bitcoin, isnt how it works

im moving mine over to ETH during the swap, its probably going to take a nice up-spike during the fork, then ill buy back into BTC once stuff stabilises
