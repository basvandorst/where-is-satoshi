Im currently out of the country for a study program which is making this complicated.  No western union near me.   Maybe I can find someone back home that I trust to pick up a western union payment for me. idk.

I wasn't sure if the paypal thing was okay or not.  So many buyers had it listed.  This compared next to people listing gift cards (wth?) and some other random payments. 
If I was a buyer, I dont think I would do any sort of cash payment.  I have done bank deposits to buy but not sure that works in my situation as a seller.
I do not have a bank account with a big branch.  Only an account with a local credit union.  
The guide on localbitcoins only shows what buttons to push.  It does not really give any advice on best practices.  It does have this statement:
" Note about payment methods: Some payment methods are considered high risk. Bitcoin transactions are completely irreversible. Once you sell your Bitcoins it's not possible for you to recover them, even if the buyers payment is reversed. That's why we recommend you sell with a low risk payment method to experienced users with a large amount of previous trades and 100% feedback. Read more about payment method risk levels."
But it does not clarify what payment methods are considered to be the lowest risk.  That would be helpful. 
I found this list.  Are there any on here you specifically advise against and any you think are pretty good?

I have a coinbase account.  But they were going to turn my btc into some junk new currency so I took all if it out and moved it.  I think that was a shitty thing to do.  wont be using their service.
