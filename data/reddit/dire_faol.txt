You're a fed.

Dude can talk. And he has this tone that says "What I'm saying is true. I know it sounds kind of crazy, and for the most part, it won't directly affect your day-to-day, but what I'm saying is true."
@_date: 2014-10-08 18:10:15
Didn't see that. That's makes it a lot better actually.
@_date: 2014-11-02 13:08:55
This is the answer. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 04:45:03
Assuming you trust that company. Open software, an old non-networked computer, and a printer would give me more piece of mind.

Also, with less than a $1billion they could run a 51% attack (right now at least).

It's about control. They don't want their citizens doing anything that makes them less dependent.

This attack doesn't target any individual. It's literally in all Intel chipsets. If a nation state is putting in this much effort to get the backdoor, no way they haven't accounted for network monitoring tools. Imagine the reprocussions if someone ever found definitive proof of this thing being used for an attack. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 17:03:48
I'm saying the deployment of the backdoor isn't targeted; its use would be, yes. My point is that the effort of implementing such a backdoor is unreasonable if well established network security practices could thwart its use. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 22:44:26
How is it high risk relative to other options? How is the reward small when you get access to literally everything about the machine? It's as thorough an exploit as possible. I'm seriously trying to learn from you, but you have to justify statements like that.

You can configure a firewall to prevent ports from responding at all to unknown IPs. Also, using UDP wouldn't be a conspiracy. I'm just saying that just because nmap doesn't show it doesn't mean nothing's listening (especially given the closed source nature of the IME).
It's a moot point anyways. Maybe the ME is 100% secure at this moment. My view is simply that a silicon-level backdoor that gives full access to the machine independent of any aspect of the OS would be a pretty powerful tool for state actors. If they haven't done it, they've thought about it and explored the possibility. And during those brain-storming sessions, they talked about the IME. You may be right that the difficulties outweigh the benefits given other options; I'm not in network security. But I'm in hardware, and this type of backdoor would be one of my top preferences.

You're right that this is what the firmware API provides; Ring-3 access was only for that specific rootkit. I'm saying architecturally, it has access to everything. It literally lives in the Northbridge.

Erasing that debt would be a bad thing. It's not debt like you or I take on debt. When one country invests money in another country, that's debt. No debt means no one is investing in each other. You can't erase treasury bonds; you pay them off as investment assets. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 22:55:25
So you're saying that because the closed-source proprietary firmware that is known to be capable of running an independent TCP/IP server isn't registering on a port scan, it must not be enabled at all? And there's no option to enable it in the bios (at least on my machine)? You don't think it's more likely that the firmware takes steps to not respond to random nmap scanning? C'mon man...source.
@_date: 2016-12-05 22:27:46
I'm not being silly. I'm pointing out that a backdoor such as this one offers complete access to the target machine. If there is any possible way to get passed a firewall, this backdoor would have the information and capability necessary to do so. Imagine the state actors are the NSA. You could have mechanisms to listen to traffic directed at other IPs. You could have backdoors in the firewall itself. There's an infinite number of ways this management engine could be utilized for an attack if a backdoor was installed. Given the complete access such a backdoor would offer to the attackers, I don't see how you can argue that state actors would not pursue it.
@_date: 2016-12-05 22:06:30
Disguise it as packets that you know the user is already sending/receiving. The attack vector has access to absolutely everything about the machine it's on. Is your argument that a properly secured firewall makes a user immune to all possible attack vectors?  
@_date: 2016-12-06 21:37:13
Source? You just went from saying the TCP/IP capabilities didn't exist to now saying they're disabled by default...
@_date: 2016-12-06 02:04:07
Still disagree. 
I'll start with exfiltrating the data. This is *always* a problem no matter what the attack vector is. Once you're in a system, you always have to get the data out somehow. This article isn't addressing that universal part of the problem; it's talking about gaining full access to all pieces of hardware with no regard for any level of security on the machine itself.
You're also not being very creative in terms of the fabrication possibilities and activating desired targets. Did you read the article? The changes to the IC are so minuscule that it's virtually impossible to detect the backdoor at the fab. It's no conspiracy at the fab; it would only take one properly placed employee to implement the change, and the article argues that no DRC or QC would detect it.
You're assuming that the backdoor always phones home (creating a "massive botnet") first instead of being activated. Again, this type of backdoor is literally full access to the entire machine at all levels. Gaining that type of access would be almost impossible without this type of hardware backdoor, but other types of less extreme vulnerabilities could be implemented easier. So maybe you gain very weak permissions on the target machine first. Then you use those weak permissions to toggle the correct line in the correct way such that the ME backdoor becomes activated. Boom, instant access to all parts of the machine.
The biggest point I disagree with you on is that it's not worth it. This is the ideal backdoor other than being someone who actually has the credentials to access the information you're interested in.
@_date: 2016-12-06 20:36:51


I feel the same way.
[Here's]( more info about the TCP/IP capabilities. You'll also read that the OS has nothing to do with anything; not sure why you keep bringing it up. I also don't know why you're talking about changing the firmware when you can just use the subsystem as designed and get access to everything described in the wiki. The question is whether there's any vector for gaining access to what's already known to be there.
@_date: 2016-12-05 18:01:58
If you had full access to every instruction executed by the processor and every single memory address, you don't think you could disguise traffic?
@_date: 2016-12-06 13:50:02
You need to read the article. The ME exists; it's official from Intel. It's already located in every modern Intel processor. All we're talking about doing is gaining access to it which is why all you're doing is flipping a bit. And no, the ME has absolutely nothing to do with the OS. It runs completely in parallel and completely hidden. This isn't something the state actors are creating; it's already there. And all of your points in your last comment are addressed in the article. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 17:44:14
Given your assumptions that it can't be updated and can't receive commands, sure. I think state actors could invalidate those assumptions thereby making the vector insanely useful.  
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:42:31
What are you talking about?
