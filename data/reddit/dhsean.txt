Which places are insured and how do you know they won’t just run? Government insures your money in the bank so you feel more protected it’s to a limit but at least it’s there

So how about you correct me instead of being a dick?

I think ya all are trying way up hard to make money off bitcoin to realise the actual problem here. Shit like this can’t happen. There needs to be protections in place for consumers otherwise it’s just going to be something used by the minority

This is why I just can't take this seriously.
If my bank account is hacked, I have a lot of protections in place to get my money back, I actually got charged £3000 and got every penny back in 2 hours thanks to the protections in place.
Some fucker takes my bitcoin, which has happened today  at least the stuff I was mining, I'm SOL.
Something has to be done. But the whole point if bitcoin I suppose is that nothing can be done. That's why people like it so much.

yes because a dollar is the same as 1.34192392131 bitcoin and a cent is the same as 0.32139139123 bitcoin

You think having several units to describe purchasing is a good thing?
This doesn't help anything when you look at a wallet and see extreme numbers. It's not user friendly. Get a 43 year old average worker to switch over to bitcoin and watch how confused they are. Watch them switch to any currency, Euros, Dollars, Pounds and it be easy as fuck to use. You aren't dealing with 0.0000004 Dollars, you're dealing with $1, 0.01
There isn't any extremes here.

I'm so glad it's starting to fall, this isn't an ideal thing to have.
It's meant to be used as a currency, imagine spending 0.00000003 fucking dollars on a coke, it's stupid to have numbers this extreme for buying things. Especially when companies work hard to figure out the best prices to get us to buy stuff ala 99p, 39p 49p etc.
Keep on bringing it down.
