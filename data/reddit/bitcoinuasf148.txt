Congratulations everyone!

Legal niggles aside, I'm interested to know how they can practically collect.

Law of diminishing totalitarian logo returns.

You make it sound like all hard forks are good. This one is most certainly not.
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:07:31
This assumes that whatever data center had 30% extra power just sitting around unused for reasons. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:49:37
Sounds like some proper fake news.
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:00:14
You mean whooooosh. Swoooooosh is the Nike thing.
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:28:10
There are like 6 offices listed in the indictment. Might start with one of those. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:46:22
Was there even any encryption then to crack? Probably just needs to be careful about the security of the system he uses to open the wallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:30:02
More likely their cold storage procedure is being stress tested.
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:01:17
Sorry, you're right. Drawing unlimited power is always cool.
@_date: 2017-07-19 03:17:56
Miners should know each other. Wink wink. Got it. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:27:48
If it doesn't, another wise rise to fill the same niche but my money's on it coming back stronger.
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:33:56
Actually no. They arguably still have a large and profitable business if they can stay online.
@_date: 2017-07-29 04:05:53
A little lube and OP RETURN.
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:09:55
Their domain was seized.
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:24:01
This means you are blind to anything substantial to the issue. By the logic you are following, anytime a crazy goes out and invents a new side that side becomes equally valid.to the others no matter the level of logical and factual support.

You're not on the mailing list? I'd recommend joining but ... UASF is best. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:16:04
Don't elevate them to our level.
@_date: 2017-07-19 01:05:59
No but it is a cartel. That's bad.
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:06:23
You can only count on it when it actually activates. Such are the rules so could be fake or not. Your post is a getting a little ahead of what's actually happened so far.
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:39:47
From one Bitcoiner to another, always use escrow. If none is available, use your credit card.
@_date: 2017-07-27 06:19:48
Aws are you kidding. Most likely Azure.
@_date: 2017-07-17 06:57:48
Best solution. There's no arguing with crazy. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 01:44:22
This is just the justice department hinting that one should keep control of their own funds.
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:47:33
They also respond like it's their full time job. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:48:53
True. People keep jumping to a conclusion about coins having been seized when there's no evidence to that effect. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:57:10
We'll see you soon, segwit.  Bip 91 or no.
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:29:09
Not really. Exchange business attracts a lot of attention from authorities. Probably better to get into blockchain analysis or Lambo trading. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:04:02
What black magic is this?
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:36:40
So... some? Audit's on the way. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:01:47
No, they don't understand the value. It'll be auctioned for the almighty dollar. Oh wait this is just a domain. Carry on.
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:30:24
Not necessary. That's 25 straps with standard mustard color equaling a modest quarter mil.
@_date: 2017-07-27 06:17:04
Better to burn them.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:39:12
I prefer rhetoric. Do you have a newsletter? 
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:12:10
Let us celebrate when segwit locks in through bip 9.
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:19:54
We're going to need this statement recorded in the hoaxchain. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:22:14
Just a joke. For now.
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:17:18
Flopt. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:59:52
If paper not fit in trash can is not problem. BTCe get bigger trash can. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:14:12
Fiat is bug 0.
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:54:09
That's not lock in. That's miners  forking themselves off with an alt.
@_date: 2017-07-27 06:14:01
If you had 1 btc then you may still have 1 btc. It's worth about $2500 now.
