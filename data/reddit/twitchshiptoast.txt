It's ok, OP. I understand you. People like to ignore btc when it's doing well and you're making money. The second we go through a completely normal crash they won't shut up about how "I knew it was a scam!" so they can finally justify their inability to take risks. Then they shut up again when it sets a new ATH and you make even more money. Repeat ad nauseam.

Currency isn't the point anymore. The btc reliant crypto market and rarity of the deflationary btc is the point. It's a market of greed that drives blockchain. As long as people want to make money then the blockchain coins will succeed because the history of ridiculous returns. At least until something better comes out like a blockchain 2.0 with some sort of decentralized round-robin for starting blocks. Anyways, currency is just a good starting point for blockchain as the most basic system of transaction logging would revolve around currency transactions and currency provides incentive for mining. Currency just happens to be the first iteration of self-sufficiency. Future implementations...like take Google. They do ad transactions all the time. They could turn Chrome into a "miner" that provided Google Play credit for mining (or nothing, which is more likely) to give them a strong blockchain of tracking their ad transactions which could greatly free their bandwidth and save them money. I forgot my point.

So what benefits are there to running a node? Do I get anything?
Even if I don't, is there an easy way to set one up? I have a spare ubuntu netbook.

That's sounds more like a standard savings account.

No. Historically it would be crashing right about a month ago.

Because 50+ year old housewives like money too. Many also have extra income to invest. Older folk love to invest and someone like Ellen or Oprah telling them about it makes them think maybe it's not a scam afterall.

Holding and buying the bottom to recover losses when it recovers.

Nice. I meant to sell mine at 800. Never let anyone tell you that procrastination isn't wonderful.
