I have a Ledger Nano S with funds on it. I'm paranoid that I wrote down the seed wrong (I doubt it but I'd like the peace of mind). **How can I verify I wrote down the seed correctly?**
If I reset the device and the seed was written incorrectly, I lose my funds due to stupidity. If I test it with a wallet online, I risk exposing myself to thieves. Can I check it offline??
Thanks for the help.

I'd urge you against that, guarding against the possibility of going below 6k and who knows how long we'd stay there. Anything below 5k is a steal in the long run though.
Nobody knows for sure. My opinion, after trading around with Bitcoin for 5 years, the likelihood of a sub-6k plunge is very real at this point.

This sounds like you're "bargaining" to me, or just in denial that we're in a bear market. Us bears don't *want* to be Bearish.

This is so beautiful. How did you make this? I hope you continue to add to it. Or somehow gets Gox 2011 data in there.

Gox died in Feb 2014. We broke the downtrend line in June, so why did we continue to go down for a whole year longer? Why wasn't the bear market only 6 months (like 2011) instead of over a year? 
Why did 2011 see a 94% drop but 2014 only saw an 85% drop, when the news in 2014 was drastically worse (China bans, Gox collapse)?
Market psychology never changes. Lower prices lead to lower confidence. Maybe bad news causes lower prices, but we're in a bear market and lower prices are expected to happen anyways. So many people bought into Bitcoin *expecting* to be millionaires in no time. These people really are going to be tested - markets aren't that cut and dry. The market participants today are behaving exactly the same as the ones in 2014 - "Wall Street is coming", "Chinese New Year", "Conferences", "Bubble Cycles/$X High prices by the end of the year." THE TREND IS DOWN, seriously people need to open their eyes.
IMO in order for bear market to end, we need a very low price - the market needs to fuck over as much people as possible and that happens through capitulation and a very strong bounce and consolidation to show the bulls are back. And perhaps, over the next few years, we can build a base to start the next cycle similar to 2013 and 2017.
And realistically, $2k is still 10x from the bottom of our whole bull run. Who really knows though - the market will do its thing. 2.8k-3k is rock-fucking-solid support.

Exactly. It's as if nobody has learned anything from the passed bubbles. There are still plenty  get-rich-quickers sitting expecting 100k next year. The trend is still down and public will start to bail when 6k is breached. Volume on exchanges has dried up, public interest isn't keeping the bubble afloat. Volume will really ramp up as we breach $6k

I see that the "this time is different" rhetoric is still hanging around. Clear denial stage.

So not even close. 
Picture Bitcoin topping at $32k back in December instead of $20k. Now picture the price being at $2k right now. That is the 2011 bubble.

Wrong. There were supsicions for months upon months about Gox. "It was FUD" they said, "everything will be okay" they said. Wrong. Bear market from hell that kept Bitcoin bruised and beaten for years. 
Tether won't be as bad as Gox, but it sure as hell would hurt the price. Anything negative is enough to  push a new low in a bear market.

MtGox, the first exchange, hadn't opened up yet. There was no price tag associated with bitcoin, it was just a fun experiment pretty much (from what I understand).

He transferred 10k bitcoins to a man who ordered pizza for him on PapaJohns.com. The dude just wanted to use bitcoin *as* a currency, and it was the first record of goods being purchased by bitcoin.

That's what I thought after 10 months of 2014 bear and people were willing to sell below $300. As long as the trend remains Bearish, people will happily sell.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:35:34
Lol. I remember, during the early days of the Internet, discovering there was a website where you can buy and send dogshit to somebody anonymously. I was fascinated by that.

Every bubble, same things are said. In 2013, we had Gox's fraudulent Willy bot bidding up the price. We also had 80% of the trade volume coming from China, who were constantly taking action to try to ban it. In 2014, getting passed $1k ever again seemed like an *insurmountable* task. And what dumbass would ever pay $1k for a Bitcoin (especially since all the price did was completely tank)? We required a country with a larger population than fucking China to start buying and mtgox tarnished Bitcoins name. *Surely* everyone has heard about Bitcoin by now since Gox was all over the news, Newsweek had a big article where they "found satoshi", metioned all across TV, etc. There were no Greater Fools left to sell to - Bitcoin was dead, the subreddit was dead, the public stopped paying attention. Congrats to all the dumbasses who bought above $500, you made the early adopters insanely rich.

Wex.nz is BTC-e with the same database and all. Just login like you normally would on btc-e

Why are you posting someone's prediction they made 4 months ago.
And why is that guy credible? Because he called it right that Bitcoin would go up? That was an easy call to make in a bull run.
