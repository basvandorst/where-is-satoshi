I view that as a good thing. This would expose the ambiguity and strengthen the protocol as it gets resolved.

Unless, as in the context of this conversation, they are the majority and propagating a bug...

Yeah, but if each client only comprised 1%  of the network, there'd be no way a bug in their code would create a bad transaction that is accepted by the network. This would give the offending client ample time and opportunity to discover and correct the error.
Contrast that with the doomsday scenario of 100% of the clients running the same code. One bug and boom! Accepted by the whole network.

Both are the enemy when they are corrupt.
Do you think that rich people are better people or less in control than the government?
They are in bed with each other. It's one big party that you aren't invited to.
There are good people in there, but they don't seem to be calling the majority of the shots.

So, are you saying you think BCH has the right to be called bitcoin?

Can Red Hat Enterprise Linux not use the name Linux because they are a fork?
Can OpenSSH not use SSH in its name because it is a fork of OSSH?

Why would someone name their fork of Linux "locus"? And how does that apply to the conversation?

Aren't both of you trying to pigeonhole bitcoin?
Both of you have a narrow view of what bitcoin is and your views are different. 
Why can't bitcoin be bigger than either of the blockchains or communities?
