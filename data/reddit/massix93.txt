Good idea!
@_date: 2019-03-06 19:48:43
Depends on the country you live. Anyway 52000 sat is better for me than 0.52mBTC
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:51:37
That’s right
@_date: 2018-10-25 01:43:34
I use an iPhone so is from the App store
@_date: 2018-10-25 01:52:46
I am against this kind of tracing. Also they have all the data required for KYC (personal documents, verified home address etc) and I don't want these data to be linked to my personal BTC wallet on any company database. 
@_date: 2019-03-10 14:24:37
Windows, lol
@_date: 2018-10-25 01:42:37
Honestly I never had a problem with them, also support was always fast and kind except for this request. They are actually my only link with FIAT money at the moment.. Time to go full crypto?
@_date: 2018-10-25 01:46:12
Thats a cool idea, but I don't want to do that cause I don't see any reason they should investigate my cold wallet
@_date: 2018-10-24 17:43:12
I know, that’s why I don’t understand what is this gonna prove, can be anybody wallet..
There is no problem I just wanted to know if this is standard and what they need it for, or if anybody has receive the same request 
@_date: 2018-10-25 14:03:51
Hi, to clarify, nobody from support asked me private keys. I was wondering if asking a screenshot of a cold wallet is a standard procedure for KYC and how it could be useful. Your team is already following the case after I sent all the other documents requested (second proof of address and declaration of funds source/salary/occupation), they will let me know shortly.
Thank you
edit: request 519709
@_date: 2018-10-25 04:12:17
I’m not!
@_date: 2018-10-24 17:00:47
They said “Providing the proof of your funds source (BTC investment) is essential for the account verification.
We will appreciate it if you can share the required wallet screenshots (cold wallet).”
@_date: 2018-10-25 01:44:46
Thats the only way I use it. I send BTC to the app when I need to refill the Wirex card to make some expenditure in fiat  
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:34:23
People aren’t good with decimals. You are free to implement the standard you want, in the applications I build I will use satoshi as base 
@_date: 2018-10-25 01:47:42
Nope, Italy
@_date: 2019-02-24 03:52:22
Cause you aren't using the lightning network in that case, is just internal accounting
@_date: 2019-04-07 15:43:08
Are you using Lightning for something?
@_date: 2019-04-16 04:43:21
Let's do it
@_date: 2018-11-29 05:31:36
Really amazing!
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:51:40
Yes you can transfer funds to another wallet, just send a transaction to the new address. 
Regarding updates I think they mean updating from app store/play store, but I can't see the 5.2 version available at the moment on iOS 
@_date: 2018-11-29 05:17:28
You see there are different credit card simbols, why is that? Cause this way the customer with American Express can pay with his card, the customer with PayPal too and now also the customer with BTC. This is good for Bitcoin users cause they can pay with btc, why do you care what the seller does with his money? They can convert ALL to btc for what we know 
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:47:22
Mainnet but still in testflight
@_date: 2019-01-28 05:15:47
That’s like saying internet won’t work cause you can't find a route to the website you want to reach. It’s a mesh, with enough hopes you can reach every point
@_date: 2019-01-28 07:12:57
So you think the design itself can't work. I’m of different advice, the network will grow with adoption and all the issues you wrote in your first message will be totally transparent to users, they don't have to guess if there is a route or if the channel they opened is well connected. Most of them won't even know to be on a second layer, just like internet users today don't have any clue of how the internet works
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:13:39
Seems great, will try it as soon as possible!
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:40:10
With that card you can pay only for coffees, with 100$ on LN you can pay everyone connected to the net. For example you and Alice have both a channel with the coffee shop? You can pay Alice through the coffe shop, btc goes you-&gt;coffeeshop-&gt;Alice. 
Now Alice has a friend, Dana, that has a channel with H&amp;M? You go to HM and just pay, btc goes you-&gt;coffeshop-&gt;Alice-&gt;Dana-&gt;HM
This creates a mesh and that’s the cool thing about LN

Time to get an iPhone then 
@_date: 2018-07-27 19:58:41
I've read all the parts of your review on Medium; it's an excellent work. I was skeptical after reading the comments in some posts here, but now all the community should say thank you. Truly competent and  
@_date: 2019-09-07 03:15:54
I can take the risk, if we meet in a public place.
@_date: 2019-09-11 19:39:38
They have introduced KYC recently
@_date: 2018-12-04 06:51:06
Could you please open the beta for iOS again? It says no more users allowed
@_date: 2018-12-02 23:55:27
You should work on UI/UX but concept is great 
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:35:52
!lntip 1000 
@_date: 2018-12-27 12:51:40
This can affect all versions on all platforms? 
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:49:40
It's an ongoing process, if I want to order my pizza in Italy I can not pay with Btc, so I need to convert. In Denmark now they can use Btc to pay which is a step forward, restaurants need to convert it cause they can't pay bills and taxes in Btc, but when they will they will have a choice too
@_date: 2019-05-03 01:15:13
It’s very cool in my opinion, at least from a technical point of view I don’t know much about the financial one
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:23:27
But is good for users that want to pay in btc. What they do with their coins is their choice 
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:21:12
As a bot developer, I should ask you to just don’t ahaha
Market sentiment through social is already really difficult to retrieve without faking anything
