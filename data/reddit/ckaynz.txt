In NZ, $85.. about  $60 usd.

Simple, blockstream satellite.
@_date: 2018-09-21 07:59:25
Pretty sure that's the amount including the change address.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:51:47
Recalc, it's a shit ton more now.. and yeah totally deserved

I tried today but need a swiss phone to complete transaction :-(
@_date: 2018-09-04 04:54:50
I get all that, my point is more that isn't the model inherently flawed, a future where bcash is dominant (I know, I know), blocks are hundreds of MB because they want to keep fees low.
 Game theoretically the miners should mine empty blocks to get the reward rather than risk losing the block for "fractions of a penny" in fees as roger would say.
@_date: 2018-09-03 05:01:49
If this is true doesn't this destroy BCH? Why would miners include 32+ mb of low fee transactions instead of going just for block reward?
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:28:53
At least people are talking about your mobile

this doesn't look good for Mcafee's member
@_date: 2018-08-29 08:32:56
Also please don't tax bitcoin trading 50%... I assume you have the ability to of course 
@_date: 2018-08-06 04:09:14
Here is a good starting point
since you know the 12 words, looks like you have to bruteforce with  max 479,001,600 possible combinations.
@_date: 2018-08-08 03:49:19
You monster, you just dumped BCH on Alex... not cool
@_date: 2018-05-22 02:46:59
its almost like you said something, but you didn't
@_date: 2018-05-02 05:49:07
If true then big else if
@_date: 2018-08-29 08:30:31
Your right, I'm not curious why you are a nocoiner, what I'm curious about is why you hang out in a bitcoin forum.
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:00:49
It's eight isn't it?
@_date: 2018-05-21 07:11:13
Why always do this comparison. If you likened bitcoin to an infectious disease in its first innings, it would be like saying it could not spread because it has only infected 1 % of the population . Facebook only had 100 users at one point, amiright?
@_date: 2018-05-22 02:52:54
Sounds like you have it all worked out... best of luck nocoiner
@_date: 2018-05-22 01:43:22
The reason for the analogy is that anything that is eventually bigger still needs to pass through being smaller, Amazon had a turn over of $100,000 at some stage... that had to happen before it got to 178 billion where it has grown to now.
I am not predicting where bitcoin goes, or even that it gets bigger, my point is simply that the fact its smaller doesn't mean it can't get bigger.
to your last point regarding wealth managers. Yes, there is a reason - its because its high risk and the future is not clear. their suggestion will change over time, it won't stay at 1% - it may go as high is 100% or as low as 0%
@_date: 2018-05-21 07:05:45
The problem for governments is that some may outlaw and some may not... those that don't will see bitcoin flowing into their country and economies.. if bitcoin delivers on its promises , those that outlawed will be on the back foot. The less risky approach is to not pick an extreme, outlaw or total freedom to operate .. . Then finally, once you have adoption / education, people will want a good reason why their government wants to take away their new found monetary sovereignty.  Game theory...
@_date: 2018-10-02 05:40:00
What are the potential ramifications?
@_date: 2018-10-06 06:47:46
Thought you were being sarcastic so my post was a joke too... these are not bitcoins, they are sold as a novelty item
@_date: 2018-10-21 18:56:59
It will due to Greshams Law, we are in the process or spawning and killing shitcoins at the moment.. this will last for quite a while
@_date: 2018-10-29 06:50:18
Looks like a shitcoin
@_date: 2018-10-05 21:02:45
Easy, they are tangible

Actually it's easier done than said :-) just wait until everyone else skips that step
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:19:02
Firstly the comment was a joke/play on the version about  investing in bitcoin, so chill a little... 
But also, in New Zealand for example in the case of a bank bailout, the depositors will take a haircut on their funds, this was introduced after the previous recession.
Can't do that with bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-06-27 07:01:00
I don't follow, are you saying you could retire for as little as 100k?
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:47:21
So the expensive step is changing to fiat? Cool, let's not do that step from now on
@_date: 2018-06-23 05:33:00
I'm buying, I bought lower and bought higher, have never sold so I don't know who's selling either... but I'm in the this thing is world Reserve currency or it's zero camp. 
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:20:15
No tradeoffs sounds a little to good to be real... dig deeper and you will see why.
@_date: 2018-06-03 19:26:49
Lightning, you actually tried it? It's awesome.
@_date: 2019-06-16 01:49:00
ouch, sorry to hear that

forgot to pack you bags or shorts open?

I Googled "intrinsic value of gold", wondering if it actually has intrinsic value, and does intrinsic value even matter?
Any way, the article is 5 years old, but i feel like the answer to the authors question is Bitcoin... Did we steal Gold's true argument for legitimacy and now the argument for gold has shifted to "its tangible" and "you can make stuff with it?"
@_date: 2019-12-06 18:54:31
I'll set my buys at $0.002
@_date: 2019-12-06 19:00:00
Oh it's on now!
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:58:49


something most smart people don't get...
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:08:00
Because it is BTC, there is no back to BTC
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:24:48
What? No I didn't say that
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:40:42
So would you run 2 nodes, 1 with tainted coins and another node as your exit point. don't create a direct channel between the two and then send payments from tainted node to exit node?
or is it simpler than that even?
@_date: 2018-11-09 18:47:27
I have 2 ledgers each with their own seeds, both on the same ledger live, when I use the wrong ledger to try and send I get the error you mentioned.
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:56:38
I'm curious, how would this work in practice?
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:56:54
No one thinks that, pretty sure he didnt add the /s in his post because it was so obvious :)
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:26:26
What's the 3 day rule?
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:43:33
I didn't get this at the start, but I do now. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 18:03:52
Sounds like you may have more than one seed OR you used a passphrase and have forgotten to enter that on your ledger.
@_date: 2018-11-03 18:24:14

The idea is its moderated - you have seen a proper debate right?
Don't get me wrong, I know debates go off the rails a bit, but somehow I still always feel like I learn something during them
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:57:28
Quick question... why don't you have an bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:50:22
Yeah, of course
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:02:35
Was the very next thread sorry for wasting your time :)
@_date: 2018-07-12 21:48:40
I am unconvinced that the futures are creating price manipulation based on volumes we are seeing. Bitcoin has had similar FOMO events in the past without futures.
With ETF, I see a couple of differences, 1. they are holding the underlying (affecting supply), unlike futures, 2. more likely that volumes are much higher than with futures.
I think we could see a massive run up and fall if the ETF volumes are low... Basically we all believe institutions want to pour billions in, if this is not true, then the price will tank.
@_date: 2018-07-16 06:56:30
Phew, you're not sure. Worried it was a certainty.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:29:54
But we gave you so much time!
@_date: 2018-07-12 07:30:15
Some will hold some will trust a third party, same is true with gold at the moment, I don't see a problem
