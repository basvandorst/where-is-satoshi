Is your real name Homero Joshua Garza, scammer extraordinaire?

Good try josh sockpuppet

Yeah that pretty much sums up Josh Garza.

Josh Garza doesn't give a rat's ass about trademark infringement. What he wants, he steals.

Most of Homero's websites spend 50% or more of their time being down. 
@_date: 2015-05-10 13:08:54
That is leased also, sorry. In fact he almost lost the domain due to non-payment. 
@_date: 2015-05-18 21:53:09
He has his own bullshit kickstarter clone for that.

Now this asshole is trying to peddle a crypto credit card, jesus christ I can't keep up with the scams from Josh Garza. Please make it stop, I want to get off. SEC are you listening??? 
@_date: 2015-05-13 21:49:20
Because he's a megalomaniac. Seriously, dude is a psychological case study waiting to happen.

I know many are tired of hearing about this guy on this sub, especially when it is not directly in association with bitcoin. Well, he's back to criticizing bitcoin while pumping his own shitty altcoin Paycoin. I figured in this instance, some people here would want to know.

Also, if you're as tired of this asshole as I am, come over to this new sub that just started today to help continuing to expose his fraud. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:14:52
The wheels of justice are turning (SEC, etc.) just waaaay too slowly. He needs to be put out of business and into leg irons.

**Relevant excerpt from Garza's "announcement"**
Mineral is here!!!
Another word for crystal……is a mineral…..
For as long as there has been money, buying and trading have happened. So its been around for a long time, a loooooooong time!
Back then, and before the "conventional money" we use today, you didn't trade pieces of "paper" with no real backing for something of value.
No, back then people traded goods that had real value. While just about everything has been used a currency at one point or another, arguably the most notable have been precious stones and minerals.
The Mineral company has landed!
Mineral will start out with a wallet service and exchange, just like Paybase.
But, it will become so much more. First, mineral is coin agnostic and is focused on advancing the industry as a whole. It already has approval for credit cards and bill and is in the final testing phase.
Plus, with Minerals strategic position in Hong Kong, it gives it access to a wealth of financial resources and protects your identity.
For starters, this means you will gain access to the world's first debit alt-coin auto load debit card. But, just as importantly, your information will never be shared.
@_date: 2015-04-02 11:12:47
He turned Paycoin over to a group of rubes called "Team Paycoin" apparently led by his preacher friend Adam Matlack who is also under investigation by the SEC and other alphabet agencies for laundering millions from overseas investors. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 15:39:49
I wish that did exist. This does though: @_date: 2015-04-02 16:25:22
Are you familiar with Garza's work? He has some of the worst grammar and spelling I've *ever* seen. He should have stayed in school. 
Reminds me of the quote he gave in an interview before starting his GAWMiners scam (I'm paraphrasing because he's not worth digging up the full quote): 'I had a lot of trouble concentrating in high school, and I thought "I should start a business'. "
@_date: 2015-04-03 11:34:36
Hey, 1 customer (Homero) to 5 customers is like 500% growth. What exchange out there can claim that??? 
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:10:58
He is specifically marketing Mineral as a "bitcoin exchange". 
@_date: 2015-04-29 10:24:19
That sounds about right. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:12:49
No, don't you see, it was all those pesky regulations, government agencies and *laws* that were holding him back. Now that this new organization is based in Hong Kong and (seemingly) out of the reach of US law/government, we will see Homero realize his true vision! Just wait, it will be GAWsome!! /s
@_date: 2015-04-02 15:33:42
He is already under investigation by the SEC and IRS (at least). 
@_date: 2015-04-03 21:02:52
LOL, I saw your lame post on hashtalk, sorry that the "trolls" took the subreddit you wanted to create. Looks like its about 2000:1 in favor of "scam" though. Good luck with that.

There is already an SEC investigation well underway. The [bitcointalk thread goes into great detail on this]( Also [coinfire]( has done a number of articles on it.

Assume you also saw this? His name shows up in the PDF properties on a document from this website. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 10:40:20
Yes, one of the leaked emails has him threatening to publish a website with this URL. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 11:27:22
He's been crowing about it for a week. He has many shady/secretive things going on, but he is very public about this one. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 10:44:58

This one has no fees. Just deposit your btc straight into Homero's pocket - end of transaction.

Grade-A sociopath douchebag. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:34:45
Yeah, he already exited his scamcoin (paycoin) by turning it over to his buddy Adam Matlack (mentioned above). There is a team of sad losers now managing that train wreck. Doesn't stop Garza from dumping his 11 million remaining  pre-mined paycoins though. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 12:12:52
Oh, I know, I'm over there too. Hoping to mobilize more of the 160k people on this sub to the cause.

@_date: 2015-04-02 11:36:38
Yes, I seriously believe he is mentally ill. He exhibits sociopathic tendencies, textbook narcissism, is a pathological liar, etc. He is a case study in psychological issues. 
This is now officially the number one problem for bitcoin IMHO. This shit needs to stop. We can't let this guy's name become irrevocably linked with bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-04-28 22:38:28
Some of the more concerning quotes: 
* 'Members of the CPIG stand with **GAW founder, Josh Garza**"
* "greater worldwide adoption of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, **Paycoin** and other... - as if the worthless shitcoin that is paycoin deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as bitcoin, let alone any other non-scam altcoin." 
* "To undo the negative impact, outcome and perception from circumstances like Mt. Gox and those that seek to undermine the category’s success through the use of highly sensationalized media covering the category based upon conjecture versus fact." &gt;&gt; these idiots obviously have been brainwashed by Josh Garza to believe that they were not, in fact, scammed, but that rather they were the victims of "sensationalized media" and "conjecture". 
You've all been warned. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 11:10:46
Hmmm, this happens to coincide with Josh Garza's announcement of his new "mineral" exchange. Methinks this is not just a coincidence. Garza's minions have been known to hack other sites before (Coinfire, etc.).  
@_date: 2015-04-22 22:46:47

Please help get the word out so we can keep this thing from gaining any traction. This guy is a complete cancer for cryptocurrency as a whole and now that he's abandoned his failed paycoin scam, he's back to our turf to peddle another scam.

@_date: 2015-03-23 16:43:05
Yes, that is one of the points of bitcoin. The point of paycoin is to remove money from your wallet and put it in Josh Garza's so he can make the payments on his Ferraris. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 16:44:10
Because he is still actively fleecing people and releasing new scam products. I've given up on getting people to stop giving him money, but I want to see him in jail.  
@_date: 2015-03-23 16:44:54
Do you mean "paycoin"? 
@_date: 2015-03-23 10:07:45

That's because this moron "paid" $1 million (I say "paid" because he is leasing the site with monthly payments that he apparently was quite behind on for a while.) for BTC.com when he was still thinking of doing something bitcoin related. But after he created his scamcoin Paycoin to compete with Bitcoin, he had to come up with the retardedly named Business Technology for Cryptocurrency to become one of his many shell companies to hide behind instead. He has Paybase, GAW, GAWMiners, BTC, and Coinstand. He thinks we are dumb enough to believe these are all separately managed companies, so when one of them does something illegal, he can deflect blame onto his other co-conspirators. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 16:48:03
He had the gall the other day to imply he has ***lost*** 8 figures throughout this scam. Either he is the worst scammer ever, or a pathological liar. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 16:50:51
Garza is more of a scammer than a thief, as far as I can tell. He prefers to let you willingly give him your money for a product he will never deliver.

That was the "corrected" version. Before that it said "We number of deals have finished and a few are in ***negation***." before one of his hashtalk followers made fun of him. I'm not even joking. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:25:52
Also, as [these leaked emails show today]( Josh's own in-house counsel confirmed that they are under investigation, and they are acting to thwart further investigation. In fact, the $20 "honor program" seems to have been dreamed up by his attorneys rather than by Josh, to appease the masses. Now it looks like that program isn't going to happen either.  
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:59:16
Also, he does not understand that the contraction of "you are" is "you're". I have literally - not once - seen him use "you're" correctly. Stay in school, kids. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:45:35
Who knows at this point. I think it's a moot point, as GAW has to be borderline broke at this point. No way he's shelling out $100k a month to save what's left of his shitty reputation. The only reason he'd part with a dime is to keep his pasty ass out of jail. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:56:00
New email "leak" from today that was making the rounds on bitcointalk. Authenticity TBD: 
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:41:49
Garza conned a lot of them through his church connections. They will gobble up anything he says like he is Jesus himself. And some of the other posters are literally children - one of the mods just turned 15.
