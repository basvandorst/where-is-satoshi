Nothing is happening that you have to worry about. Mt. Gox was an exchange couple years ago that had 90% of transactions going through them. They don’t exist anymore because of bitcoin siphoning that was happening. Millions were stolen and lots of customers still don’t have their money back.

Yes, but at the time that rise was a new all time high, we are still down 50% from the current all time high.

Denouncing it does not give it legitimacy, we don’t need him to give it legitimacy. The best thing he could have done is ignore it and let it play its course.

If we go by the articles implication of grandparent as someone being older around 60+ years old. It’s unlikely that Satoshi is 60+ or a “grandparent”.
He’s probably middle aged. Learned to code while young in the 90s and started bitcoin because of the housing bubble pop. I would say 40-45 years old

Probably not the safest idea to share this info. I understand you’re happy and proud of that accomplishment, and you should be, but there’s a lot of people out there that want that 10.5 BTC and will try their hardest to take it from you. Even if it’s in a hardware wallet or something, they may just keep tabs on you until you do end up moving it somewhere vulnerable.

Just because you got scammed and binance refuses to give you free money doesn’t mean you have to spam reddit with a post about it every week. How hard is it to just take responsibility for your own actions and learn from them?

I see people using logarithmic charts often, but do they actually have any major value in TA? I don’t know enough about it to make my own opinion.

That’s why I said according to the articles implication of grandparent. It’s a common phrase to call an old person a grandma or grandpa.
There’s hundreds of examples of people under 40 creating things more revolutionary and more complex than Bitcoin: Vitalik Buterin, Charlie Lee, Vlad Zamfir, etc. I don’t know where you got that idea from.

Sad thing is that we learn from other people’s emotions including the very negative ones. One user during the low of 2014-2015 said he margin traded and lost everything, his next (and last) post was on r/suicidewatch asking how to tell his family he was going to kill himself. The unfortunate truth behind suicide posts are that they can also be seen as a strong buy signal. I know that sounds so wrong, but like I said it’s the unfortunate truth.

Yes, and before consensus, I heard, “the price always jumps after consensus historically.” I’m just gonna go ahead and not use history as a deciding factor here because we don’t have much history and we are in different times in crypto than we were 4 years ago.

You’re right, supply and demand, psychological milestones, they all still work in crypto it’s no different, the only reason it’s harder is because of the smaller market caps.

Likely explanation written by another user who is extremely knowledgeable in economics. I won’t disclose who he is due to the subreddit he’s apart of wanting only quality posts from natural growth. There are actual reasons why the Fed does stuff.
“I'll take a stab at this bc I have a few minutes. So people know, I work in (primarily) US credit markets, but not expressly in ultra short term treasuries (eg repo). What I'm writing about is more the 'desk chatter' that's floating around fixed income desks and is not anything official. That said desk chatter is usually pretty correct.
So for the last 6mo, there has been a pretty powerful 'euro carry' trade going on in the EU/UST debt markets. The gist is that tons of investors are borrowing in the EU at stupid low yields and taking the money to loan in the US (generally by buying USTs and USD denominated debt). This is a classic carry trade where you make the spread. Look up the 'yen carry' that indirectly and partially funded a good chunk of the US housing boom in the 00s.
Now speaking to the current action in the repo market. From the highest level, there is an absence of straight cash in the US repo markets. The 'straight cash' in US repo markets is mostly excess bank reserves (eg the extra cash banks hold above the minimum regulatory requirements - banks lend this overnight to get a little extra interest on thier cash holdings). This whole ordeal is about there being a dearth of excess bank reserves. The media is talking about corporate taxes and fed auctions - all these things are having an impact, as are increased lending and increased refinancing activity in both the resi and commercial markets (remember that excess reserves get hit on both the asset and liability side.)
Anyway, what people are missing (and the the street is chattering about) is the growth in Eurodollar accounts. Eurodollars are US dollars held within the european banking system - 'european' + 'dollars' = eurodollars. When european institutional investors put on the eurocarry trade from above, either the loan holder, the comm bank or the investment bank will need to hold USD as a liquidity buffer to the loans held. This is exactly the same as any bank making a loan - for every $X of loans held $Y of 'safe' assets need to be held in reserve; the only difference here is that its French/German/etc banks operating in a currency that they have to borrow overseas against meaning their reserves have to be in a different currency (or hedged out, but keep in mind that all FX hedges require an open credit facility in USD, which reduces excess reserves with american banks - different mechanism, same impact on USD excess reserves). This is a complicated area, but this has to do with the Basel Accords and Tier 1, 2, 3 capital ratios for banks - I'm not going into this bc its straight brain cancer.
Here is the punchline: 1) As these europeans put on the eurocarry trade, the european banking system has an increased demand for US cash - this means that there is relatively less cash in the US banking system (EDIT: via either direct USD holdings or increased line of credit demands on US banks which depresses excess reserves). 2) UST/Cash desks aren't really worried that this is a sign of impending doom or a structural disaster about to happen. The Fed has tons of access to straight cash, and there's no 'real' shortage over the long term. The thing to watch for is the longer term capital flows - if euro banks lower rates, but all the capital 'created' goes to USD accounts, then that's net bad for all of the EU.”

@_date: 2019-10-18 05:47:09
On the contrary, the bullish opinion uses bitcoin “history” as its research. Not very credible. Secondly, I don’t believe karma is supposed to work like disagree == downvote, agree == upvote. Typically downvoting should be reserved for false information, trolling, irrelevant information or statements etc etc. 
Besides the point, I’m mostly implying how this place is a complete echo chamber filled with people who cannot bare to hear anything negative about bitcoin or alternative outcomes other than it absorbing the entire monetary system.

One thing I’ve learned after more than a year and half in these subreddits. Is to take anything anyone says on here with a grain of salt because 95% of the time they’re gonna be talking out of their ass or they’ll be super biased.

Bit of a personal question here. 
How has the whole situation throughout the years made you as a person? Would you say that it made you better or worse?

Just anything you could elaborate on would be nice.
