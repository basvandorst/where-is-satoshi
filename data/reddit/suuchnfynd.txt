Lol I said that in the heat of the moment. Doesn't change the fact that I think they could have handled it a little better. And yes, I will be looking at other options.

I definitely consider this news.

It was my wallet so that shouldn't matter. Anyway, when the problem was fixed the transaction showed up so all is well.

I'm not shouting scam at all. I have a vested interest in this only being a bug. I'm only here to have an open discussion, to ask questions of those that know more than me, and to stay updated if anyone learns of anything new. Like I mentioned earlier, I've never had reason to question them as a business. However, my coin is currently tied up in their system, it is now worth less than it was when I got it, and they did fail to keep us abreast of what was happening in the beginning stages. This isn't a darknet site; if the cashier at Wal-Mart held my money but didn't give me my purchases I'd complain about them too.

All's I know is, as soon as my transaction posts to the chain (Please Baby Jesus, PLEASE post!) I'm GONE. F*** that.

Unless you're holding cash in-hand, your money is always with a third party. Any amount of money that can potentially be stolen from me makes me uncomfortable. If bitcoin is to become truly universal, it should be as comfortable to use as any fiat currency.

That makes sense, but I would think there would be a way to check that, maybe through their website. Or there should be, anyway.

Funny thing is it's still pretty new. I don't wanna say 'give it time' (don't wanna jinx it) but a couple hundred people have been burned in just this time. Most don't even notice the problem until after they have been looking for a transaction for 30 minutes that just won't seem to post.

My publlic key via the blockchain.

Only mentioned because it happened before the bug. This thread was for discussion; I am not accusing anyone of anything. Please reread post.

I never questioned my dealings with them. If anything, I was more worried about individual users than the site. It's just very uncool for no one to have stepped in to quiet the storm. Not to mention BTC rates are getting rockier by the moment and users may not be able to complete transactions as planned when (if) everything is straightened out. Sounds a lot like a recent occurance elsewhere...

It hasn't been very long since it started. Maybe 3+ hours or so. You were very lucky to have withdrawn before the problem started.
@_date: 2015-04-26 04:44:53
Haha, if it worked I wouldn't need it. It's kinda like needing a light to find the light switch.
@_date: 2015-04-26 02:37:14
Nice PR!
@_date: 2015-04-26 03:05:48
A few members mentioned a questionable, LARGE (800+ BTC) outgoing transaction that took place very recently. I'm not very informed on what that may mean but I thought it was interesting.
I will say that I'm not here to cause panic, and you make a very valid point. I also hope that this is just a bug.
Edit: for anyone that thought I made this up. 
 
@_date: 2015-04-26 03:47:52
Someone did make an interesting point though. How do BTC disappear without showing up on the blockchain? I don't know enough to speak on it but it seems counter to the whole BTC concept. Every satoshi should be accounted for in some way right? Especially a company working as an intermediary, right? I only understand BTC basics so this seems like a valid question to me.
@_date: 2015-04-26 06:33:26
Awesome, thanks for coming through. Really glad everything worked out in a fairly timely manner. I still think a heads up would have been nice.
Side note: Who is Brad? it showed him as being an admin that was online when it first started and everyone was complaining. I believe part of the reason a lot of people were upset was because he didn't acknowledge the situation at all.
@_date: 2015-04-26 03:25:23
I agree with you. It's more of a courtesy thing. If they're working on it, then they should say so. Members have a right to know what is happening with **their** money. Especially since **this seems to be having an effect on BTC exchange rates.** I just read somewhere (forgive me for not citing) that LBTC is probably responsible for a considerable amount of BTC traffic. It's only fair IMO.
Edit: Admin mentioned work in progress.
