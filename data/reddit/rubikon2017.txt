Good post but we need to figure out high fees. It’s 30$ now

Clearly something fishy happened. With that said, since August 2017, Coinbase was saying that they would be adding BCash by End of the Year. Certainly the exact date was surprise but not a complete shock. What did you guys expect was going to happen when they added it.

Bitcoin is the new gold. How often do you buy or sell gold
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:44:11
Well the good news is that you have pretty good instincts. Perhaps you will make another good investment.

6 months ago people would be terrified to see 4K price. Now everyone is excited. What am I missing.

It is the dad

Just one location?
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:30:21
I heard some guy gave a 10,000 bitcoins for pizza. Must have been pretty tasty.

Cause they missed on bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:37:25
Maybe it was Mark Cuban

This captures the mood perfectly. But it only works for those who hold bitcoin and just experienced a 40% correction.

Translate into plain American please))

Did you get some IOTAs?
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:42:19
Boy, that’s a small hand!
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:46:12
That’s very generous of you! Your parents should be proud also!

What is your biggest regret in life?
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:36:36
None of the wallets or exchanges are 100% safe. Paperwallet is the only 100% proof way
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:51:09
Hopefully you don’t get trick or treaters at 1am!!
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:38:43
Satoshi is so clever, still fooling all of us
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:09:43
