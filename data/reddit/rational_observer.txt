Well if you say so I'll take your authority for it. Would be nice to have a separate name for a node that can provide a full blockchain. My understanding was that a full node provides the full blockchain. Pruning node would just be an active network node.
edit: found an archive node name in another reply, look like I am out of touch
@_date: 2016-08-15 13:27:48
No, he doesn't. If you prune you don't run a full node. Other nodes can't bootstrap from you.
@_date: 2016-08-15 16:34:00
Of course. But it cannot provide blocks for bootstrapping. I think full node name came from storing the full blockchain.
@_date: 2016-08-15 14:50:57
Yes, it's a *full* node after all. Plus verifying it and sharing data with other nodes.
@_date: 2016-08-16 08:19:14
Well, I'm sorry but I might have misled you. That was my understanding but according to [comment]( pruning node is also a full node. I guess short name for a "real" full node would be archival node. So you were right and I was wrong.

Pretty good questions. Most are probably too lazy to answers because with this level of curiosity you probably could be better off just reading something longer and learning how it all works in detail. Anyway, let me try:
1) Good worry. Private key is stored by your wallet. In many wallets it's stored in encrypted form and only end up decrypted in memory after you provide some kind of passphrase. If we are talking e.g. about android, other apps cannot access wallet app data (unless there's something broken). In case of desktop e.g. windows if your computer is compromised then your bitcoins may be stolen (see later answer)
And yes, stealing means sending them to some other address (to which you don't have private key)
2) There are may kind of bitcoin ATMs, giving bitcoins or cash. If you get cash for bitcoins it's safe because you just send bitcoins to specific address (well it could not give you cash after that, but the rest of your funds are safe). If you pay with cash similar thing, and with CC in theory somebody could steal your credit card details. There are a few common brands of bitcoin ATMs though and usually they are not in public but inside some bar/shop so it's hard for somebody to mess with them.
3) Yes the information about your bitcoins is stored on every computer running a full node. Your wallet will show it if you provide the address, but to spend them you need your private key (in some wallet it may be called a seed, this list of  words is converted to your private key)
4) That is a problem, because it's hard to be sure about your machine security. That's why hardware wallets were invented (e.g. trezor). Private keys don't touch your online device then and are stored on the hardware wallet. Hardware wallet takes care of signing transactions and making sure they send what you wanted to send.
5) It is. Most popular apps are open source though and installed by many users, so it's unlikely. 
Too lazy to proof read so I'm sorry about any mistakes, hope this helps.

OK, this sounds good. But there are now full nodes, and almost full nodes. I mean, SPV separation is clear, it's a different animal. But maybe I'm not receiving the witness because it's this half-full node? So are IPs to really full nodes going to be advertised separately? And those nodes who did not upgrade? They are happy to provide you this valid anyone-can-spend, but they have no idea about some witness stuff. 
And did I understand correctly that it is going into Bitcoin really soon? It's really a huge change. Not even tested by any altcoin (AFAIK).

None. You can find way cheaper linux VPS providers that will run full node easily.
You don't need so much RAM. All it does is that it saves you some IO, but no it doesn't help the network. Bandwidth can help, and running multiple instances in different locations will also do more than a single big one (to run a big one you will want to adjust max connections).

Current CNY: 2620 (BTCC) = $409

So it seems higher in CNY. If it is harder to get fiat out of the country arbitrage is biased because if people use it to move money out, they create sell pressure in USD but not in CNY.

It does not change the fact that they are a bad service based on what happened. 
They did not respect their customer enough to give him back his accidentally sent bitcoins.
What they did now was not caused by caring about their users, but out of pure self interest. They were losing business because of this incident. 
Companies should react to user complaints even if they don't go viral on social media.
@_date: 2016-01-04 10:23:42


See how vague is that? How do you establish that? I can spawn 10K nodes easily. Who decides which companies create economic majority? We have trouble agreeing on the block size within community. This is orders of magnitude harder.
And this is why we have mining where vote is given to the hashing power. Of course it is miners best interest to make Bitcoin as useful as possible. But they are the ones who vote.

I don't like RBF. But it is reasonable. Otherwise you have basically security by obscurity. If something is possible to do, it should be open and clear that it is and it should be made easy so that everyone has to take that into account.
Regarding SegWit I was screaming wtf hard even here on reddit when I first learned about it, but even though it's a big change (which is still very scary, bugs are hard to avoid, but hopefully there won't be any that ruins consensus), it's a huge win for Bitcoin. It's basically Bitcoin 2.0 enabling it to do much more powerful things in the future. I'm still scared of the change, it could open vectors of attacks that we are not aware of yet, but big changes are always scary, and sometimes they are needed.

"Turning off" is not good enough. The whole point of the cold storage is that even if your machine would be compromised, as long as you don't connect it to the network, nobody can steal your keys.

Because as a customer I want to keep my money in Bitcoin, and customers make rules.
Because unlike Visa the process can be way safer (just do a little research how CC payments works, it's a joke, and that's why it has to be expensive, taking care of all the reversibility and handling all fraud cases).
Unlike e.g. VISA there's an open market which you can easily enter as a payment processor. You cannot go and start a new CC company in your garage.
And by bitcoin under the hood of course I mean this coffee would not end up as a transaction in the blockchain. Txs would more likely be - me funding my wallet account, merchant withdrawing their funds at the end of the day. With sidechains - maybe even those would be somewhere else.
But the role that stays with Bitcoin and which is the most  important Bitcoin role is the value of storage. This is what it is best at. If you want to keep your wealth in Bitcoin (and I think number of such people will only increase), solutions that use Bitcoin are most convenient for you. Fiat becomes unnecessary additional step. 
You may say I'm a dreamer.. but I'm not the only one. I don't post much anymore so I'll add one unrelated thing extra.
Why Bitcoin over any other cryptocurrency? It's clear that as technology develops it is easier to integrate it in to new cryptocurrency that modifying existing one. And one thing you  can be sure if we are to stay alive is that the technology will improve and we will come up with some brilliant solutions.
The answer is the value of storage. If we are ever to store some value in a cryptocurrency, we must know it will stay there. That's the most attractive thing, limited supply and truly yours money. So it's OK if we move on to something else if value stays preserved e.g. thanks to sidechains and two-way pegs. But if we would leave Bitcoin, there is no coming back. Once we switched from one crypto to another, we will do it again, your value is never safe. I'm not the only one who realize this, and that's why people keep their wealth in Bitcoin already. And that's what keeps this currency strong. 
If we are ever to store our wealth in a cryptocurrency - it will be Bitcoin, or it will be pegged to Bitcoin.

Good point, but it's harder to target specific node when you just fire up some nodes.

Got me curious, hope you don't mind additional quetsions.
1. Where is this key stored? If I understand correctly, miner will need it when he wants to verify tx that uses output from the encrypted transaction. 
2. Is this 6 blocks enforced in any way? If I don't reveal the key within 6 blocks then it's too late and unless recipient will do the output becomes unsdependable?
3. Can output from encrypted transaction be spent before revealing the key? If yes, then would it still be able not to allow double spend from it using another encrypted transactions?
Keep up the great work, thanks.

No need for that. They did bring him the laptop. It was just too easy. It's beyond me how Gavin could fall for that.

You public key is never revealed as long as you only receive. Yes, we know addresses don't send only receive. It is used as shortcut, nobody wants to describe everytime that well I mean tx using pubkey which this address is a hash of in case of tx that was just pay to address for this one. 
Saying that just receiving is unsafe is a FUD. There may be privacy concerns if you don't know what you're doing but there's no security concern.

But there are so many holes in general. How would he even rationalize all scamming that was outed few months ago? Trying to fake the key, using some website with webgl demonstration and saying that it was his server farm monitoring and whole lot of stuff. I won't even mention current public "proof".
I like to believe that Gavin is not that gullible. Which makes me think he may be in trouble.

You know perfectly well what he meant - bigger blocks mean more HDD usage, but less backlog. Regarding implementation details, big part of the mempool can be stored on HDD.
But you let your emotion win and got back with some snarky reply which you wouldn't like yourself if you would stumble upon it.

Certainly possible. But you must remember that in such setup there were tons of options. Since the laptop was provided by CSW you could easily make a software where you have remote button to toggle if verification goes through or not (using bluetooth or internet connection, or if you are very creative even laptop's mic + high frequency sound.
It could even receive the string that is supposed to be verified from the "signing" machine.

Outside NY, yes. Bitlicense.

To me it was also the only new piece of information ;)

Maybe one services bit could be used for this also, so that even before connecting node may prefer nodes supporting encryption.

Article is indeed very good.
But if CW was close to the development why would he e.g. [steal somebody's else article]( regarding basics of Bitcoin rather than write his own?
@_date: 2016-05-27 13:44:34
Maybe he did, but there is nothing about it in the linked article.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:45:20
Given all the evidence that is piling up against Craing being Satoshi, I'd say I indeed need to mark Gavin as compromised.

Not even suspicious, with their kind of hashpower they don't need to use any pool. There are tons of blocks mined by "unknowns"

Yeah, I assume they being a team of lawyers didn't break any law, but still it seems really wrong. Spending a few million bucks they could share like a $100 with some coder to only send the relevant part to each victim.

Yeah, well for one reason or another they did a terrible PR move. But let's not forget they are one of the main companies that pushed the whole Bitcoin ecosystem forward a lot. 
It's fair to say that Bitcoin wouldn't be where it is today without Coinbase. Sure, it's better to keep bitcoins on your own, and yes decentralized exchanges or something like localbitcoins is better. But these kind of companies make it simpler for average Joe. They are really needed.
So there's no reason to do witchhunts within community. Let's focus on common goals instead of differences in opinions.

If you want to know answers to technical questions you need to know some fundamentals. Google "public key cryptography" and "symmetric key encryption". 
To create transactions you use your private key. BIP is about encrypting communication between you and other nodes (using key you both agree on using crypto magic).

If you want to know if they are happening *at all*, then I think the answer would be yes. Even with no threats, there will be some white hats just playing around or guys who want to keep collecting stats.

Apart from other reasons stated by others, reusing address i spending multiple times from the same address. If you receive many different payments to the same address and then send them all in a single transaction to another one, that's ok, it's not reusing address.
@_date: 2016-05-26 17:56:50
Well it's up to you what you do with that information.
@_date: 2016-05-02 16:23:51
Earlier blocks are not easier to brute force. Difficulty for them doesn't matter know because they are part of the blockchain. Each block has reference to the previous one, so you cannot just switch one.
I agree that early coins work as kind of a bounty for problems with ECDSA, but breaking it enough to recover them seems extremely unlikely.

This gets posted every few weeks. They do rounding of last points wrong. And didn't manage to fix it in the last N years. There was [no bump lately]( 
edit: Well maybe a bit in the [last 7 days]( probably better visible on [sipa's charts](

Since they don't have to be replaced every 2 months, you can have a bitcoin mining heater at your home for example. ASICs are very expensive to design but once you go through the whole process chips themselves are really cheap.

From HN:
EDIT 2: Debunked!
The signature in Wright's post, is just pulled straight from a transaction on the blockchain. Convert the base64 signature from his post (MEUCIQDBKn1Uly8m0UyzETObUSL4wYdBfd4ejvtoQfVcNCIK4AIgZmMsXNQWHvo6KDd2Tu6euEl13VTC3ihl6XUlhcU+fM4=) to hex (3045022100c12a7d54972f26d14cb311339b5122f8c187417dde1e8efb6841f55c34220ae0022066632c5cd4161efa3a2837764eee9eb84975dd54c2de2865e9752585c53e7cce), and you get the signature found in this transaction input: 
* ECDSA - not compromised
* Satoshi - not found
* Gavin - compromised

That's how it should work in theory. In practice the more mentions the better. I remember when coindesk was starting, it had absolutely terrible reputation here on reddit and elsewhere, yet it became widely popular.

What the actual fuck. It's like a bank would send you your current statement along with all other clients statements with their full names.
