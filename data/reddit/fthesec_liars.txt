**Clearly, the SEC and the big banks are spreading more chaos with bull crap press releases.** The SEC is full of crap, they **lie, manipulate and have back\-channel dealings to screw over innocent people** and are in bed with those who are well politically connected and bank board members, Governor who tie up married women in their basement, and their lawyers who protect them are the worst.  They just think they can run roughshod all over anyone and everyone...they had best start to think again! Collectively, banks and their execs are the primary source of funds for the SEC's insanity and corruption. To be frank, the only real criminals, **that should all be convicted of criminal racketeering,** are the Execs at the SEC, the execs at Banks, and government officials and their lawyers who thrive on stealing and get away with it, every day, while we keep enabling them. Its so funny how much crap they spread so hugely in the press about Crypto, but, the real thieves are just pissed off as they are not getting the same opportunities to rip people off for billions if not trillions a day trading FOREX, as many have switched to crypto markets which is about the only safe market left because **dark liquidity pools** \(the banks\) hide level 2 data, on the FOREX, and bend you over and steal billions from innocent people every single day \(FOREX is a $4 to $5 Trillion per day market\). They are still throwing their little 5 year old temper tantrum because there vacation homes they pay for, from money they steal from us every day, are in danger of going bye bye. If everyone would just stand up, tell the big banks to go steal from each other and go have fun charging each other fees and screwing each other over, and stay out of Cryptos, we will all be doing amazingly well, just like we have been, but they are not doing very well, or believe me, they would not be throwing millions into international public press releases like this one among many others, to inflict fear into those who are too stupid to realize they are simply getting everyone to sell out, so they can take larger stakes at bottom prices, since they were all too stupid to get in long ago. Don't be fooled, and if we stay away from the banking system, eventually, they will dwindle away, and so will their alleged power, as they hide behind the shadows of lies and deception with their *Mission Continues* enabling their continued criminal illegal theft agenda. WE MUST FIGHT BACK!! They are human just like we are, and way more stupid too, why they have to steal from everyone and stick together like a gang of racketeers, and nobody put them in charge of my life, or anyone else's. So they can all go rule over themselves while sitting in prison, as that is where all of these crooked pathetic LIARS belo**ng. That is a f**act. And believe me, I have first hand experience dealing with these pathetic snakes in the grass.  So stay in, and dont be scared, they are the one's who are running scared, that is blatantly obvious by this bull c*rap modus oper*andi of scare tactics they are trying to push on the people.  They don't scare me, and they should not scare you either, because they are weak\-minded common thieves who got away with murder for far too long.
