This is dumb. All bitcoin ATMS charge outrageous fees, almost criminal.

Jack Dorsey is a liberal cuck who silences free speech of people he disagrees with. I'd rather he not be associated with Bitcoin.

lol ok

They've paid me on time and fairly for 12 years now, the site I'm referring to. 
I'm sure they don't know a ton about bitcoin, bitcoin was kind of forced on the online gambling community since it's really the only option we have left until the US stops trying to enforce morality by law.

I'll share if I can get some advice on another card lol

I will look into Wasabi Wallet for sure... thanks. 
Is it obvious it's trying to be hidden though? They said in the email that any attempts to obfuscate the transfers will result in an account closure. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 22:03:46
What should I be doing instead? Feel free to PM me.

I think I've used bitcoin too much. That's why coinbase banned me. Now bitpay probably too. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 01:07:16
I got banned from coinbase 2 years ago, does that matter? 
@_date: 2019-02-15 21:51:59
So if I send it to blockchain when I withdraw and then send it to breadwallet and then send it to bitpay and then send it to gemini they won't care?
I hope you're right, but I'm not sure you are.

This is true of stocks too. And equities. Everything really.

I mean you did spell lose wrong. The day I take investment advice from a stranger on the internet who can't spell lose correctly is the day I deserve to lose my money. 
Not saying I was holding, just logistically.

Okay, sweetie pie.

He started the spiel "Einstein" and also if you say something is going to go up or down, you have a 50/50 chance.
To the greater point though, most intelligent people knew a sell off was coming. The amount of "smart money" hanging around from $20,000 to $4800 is low. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:26:54
I've got no anger. I'm sorry about your issues that are causing you to project, friend. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:19:26
No real support at $5000... passive support if anything. 
Not good. $4000 is coming now probably. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:33:13
What's the bottom? $2000? 
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:36:37
Damn I just checked the value of my Venezuela currency and see that you’re right. 
There are bad places to store your money. Thanks for the breaking news.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:21:27
$4.00 transaction fee and it still takes an hour to get a confirmation lol
This isn’t going to work.

You’ll see by the salty people down voting me that most bitcoiners are delusional and can’t accept the downfalls of it compared to fiat. Fiat never goes down. Bitcoin is essentially down right now for transactions.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:26:31
Trying to do a real transaction with bitcoin right now and I paid a massive fee and it still won’t confirm. 
This just will never be used for transactions on a legitimate scale.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:48:27
$4 fee and still unconfirmed over 75 minutes lmfao
