Added an important edit: Coinbase was apparently not in the Chinese App Store previous to today. So their app was _not_ removed this morning. My apologies for the bad info. 
I do not know if this was true for BTC China or Blockchain. Can anyone verify status of those apps in China App Store yesterday?

I think there are two issues here:
1. This is not a fool-proof version of a pay with Bitcoin gas pump. It is a working demonstration, and a first version at that.
2. Evaluating the issue of double-spend is more about the risk profile for the merchant. For example, a bad actor would have to first find out about the Bitcoin pump pilot project decide to go to this, and then stand at the pump and attempt to double-spend while knowingly defrauding one of the earliest real-world use cases for the currency.  So that would have to be a strangely-wired person.
In the article, I try to allude to this not being ready for mass-consumption in part because of this issue. 
I see nothing wrong with wanting to consider what obstacles do exist between making this a mass-produced thing. So focusing on double spend I see two possible fixes:
1. The pump operator could offer some kind of anti-double-spend guarantee, where they charge everyone a fee and use a portion of the fee as an insurance against bad actors. (I believe this is how Bitpay is set up)
2. The pump operator could require a multi-sig in order to kick off the transaction, where one of the signatures comes from someone who guarantees the customer's funds exist. If the customer turns out to be committing fraud the guarantee organization would cover the loss to the business.
Building either of these is another big step from just putting out a working, reasonable (but not fraud-proof) gas pump. So this is where the pump is at today.

Congrats to the Boost team!
Our startup, Gliph, was in tribe 2 of Boost VC. Boost backed our company because of our effort to make Bitcoin easier to use and more useful currency.
We're really just getting started, with lots of great work still to do.  
That said, we would not be in the place we are without Boost and _all_ of its limited partners. These include the folks who put in money for our fund, like Lightspeed Venture Partners (who recently backed Blockchain.info) and some great Angels, and also the support network.
I would encourage any startup founder wanting to make Bitcoin a success to seriously consider applying to Boost VC.  Additionally, I'd be happy to answer questions directly about the program. Send me a note here on reddit and I'll provide contact details.

@_date: 2015-01-06 18:35:23
To give these two quotes their full context, the text from the blog entry is: 
We’re also reviewing each new listing prior to publishing in Gliph Marketplace because:
1. We want to make improvements on Gliph Marketplace as quickly as possible. We can gather feedback and respond to it faster by limiting how many sellers are using the system at first.
2. Gliph Marketplace is not a dark market. It is intended to be well-lit and safe place to buy and sell stuff. Especially at the beginning, we want to make sure people’s first experiences are good ones.
We believe in the promise of decentralized marketplaces also. I wrote a blog entry specifically to address questions around decentralization and freedoms in selling: 
@_date: 2015-01-06 17:35:27
I see. I will have to think about how we could support any given wallet address. Receive is easy. However Gliph Marketplace offers frictionless sending of Bitcoin to pay for goods. This is an important part of the experience we're trying to offer. 
We need to be able to have access to a wallet that can listen for, "please send this amount to this address" on demand. This means the wallet needs to be built out with either an API for access via the internet or locally via services.
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:18:13
Thank you, jwzguy!
@_date: 2015-01-06 18:33:11
It looks like compatibility with other bitcoin services is through URI handling. Off hand it looks like we'd need to build a general purpose wallet address watch service that sends unique, expected payment amounts, similar to what bitpay does to confirm payments for merchants from random wallets.
So this is possible, and may work to support any wallet, but it is a sizable project. Right now, working with wallets that provide APIs is achievable and allows us to offer some reasonable Bitcoin support immediately. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 19:55:12
Approved! Thanks for listing. I encourage someone here to trying buying David's mug. :)
The web app is pretty easy to use. Here's a direct link to his item:

Thanks for having a look at those items. We are encouraging sellers to offer shipping, but feel we have more work to do on the reputation and arbitration side before we push that. Many things to polish still. :)
Once we have reputation, we are hoping folks will be happy to pay a small fee for Gliph managing the listing, communication and payment handling using the marketplace.
The theme we have on the main page we paid for, it is a template. We plan to re-do our homepage again, but have been working on the three clients iPhone, Android and Desktop web and getting marketplace jazzed up. Our team is pretty small. :)

Hello, I work on Gliph.
Thanks for trying out Gliph. It has a bit of a learning curve, but we're making some pretty steady improvements to it, and the bitcoin functionality.
@_date: 2013-09-20 23:11:49
The whole symbol-based usernames thing turns off some people and we are ok with that. 
We chose this concept because it was novel, didn't expose personal information and some people really enjoy picking their gliph out. Some people pick symbols (which we call Artifacts) that show off their personality.
Still, we spent some of our time in Boost.vc this summer changing the new account setup. The app now picks a gliph for you and you can customize it if you want.
The interesting thing is that since making that change, I now get feedback that people did not realize they could customize their gliph and want to know if they can change theirs.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:03:50
Hey, the rules for what is allowed in the app store are set by "guidelines" which are a living document.  Terms of service is usually a more rigid document. 
So we didn't violate terms of service. There was a particular guideline cited, which is 22.1. It refers to the need for apps to only have functionality that is legal in all areas the app is available in the App Store.
@_date: 2013-09-09 16:03:47
We would add another row of five Artifacts.

I'm not sure I understand the question, but I'll try to give more detail on how it works.  At this point you do need to have a Coinbase account to send Bitcoin. If you don't, you will encounter an error when trying to send Bitcoin.

Hey, that's very cool. Thanks for the extra information. I'm curious, roughly how much Bitcoin did you spend?
@_date: 2013-09-20 23:07:32
I agree that this experience should be way better. The team has done a great job making the experience solid on iOS. If you send message the iPhone app shows "Sending Message," "Message Sent" and even a progress bar toward completion on picture messages.
The reason it seems slower on Android has less to do with lag and more to do with how the user interface handles that lag.  The reason there is a big sending message interrupt is that we built that a while back and have not had the resources to do the level of Android development necessary to give a faster-feeling experience.
We will be using a portion of our fundraising to improve the Android experience and hope people will bear with us. We do work very hard to make the system great, and right now it is way better on iPhone.
@_date: 2013-09-06 16:59:36
Close. You can choose between three and five from a set of 20 symbols. We call the symbols "Artifacts." Artifacts make up your Gliph. Your gliph dually serves as a unique identifier other than your phone number, and also as a way you can express your individuality.

Hey there. 
Coinbase does create actual bitcoin wallets. When you sign up for Gliph and choose to create a Bitcoin wallet, we create a Coinbase account. The result is you now have an actual Bitcoin wallet available to you. 
Via your new Coinbase account credentials, which we make available to you, you can do all normal operations expected from a Bitcoin wallet.
tl;dr: Unless you don't count cloud-hosted wallets, we are in fact creating "true" bitcoin wallets. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 18:19:56
We do support smaller denominations on the Android application. The Android application also shows a 24 Mt. Gox weighted average for how much BTC you are sending.  We'll be working to offer this in the next iOS release as well.  Here's more info on the Android app with a screenshot of that dialog: 
@_date: 2013-09-09 21:53:03
Hey there. Thank you for bringing this up. Yes, you *must* disable 2FA on Blockchain.info to attach your wallet. Enabling it again will break the connection to Gliph. This is a limitation imposed by Blockchain.info's API.
For now, you can handle this limitation in part by using Blockchain.info's "double encryption" or second password on the account. 
However, if you're dealing with a lot of Bitcoin we recommend using multiple wallets. One to keep your bitcoin in (possibly offline, or in a safe machine), and another with a lower Bitcoin balance for use as a daily wallet.  This is the one you would more comfortably attach to Gliph.
We already offer two-factor on both Coinbase and BIPS wallets in use by Gliph, and will enable it for Blockchain.info as soon as it is available.
@_date: 2013-08-09 00:43:34
I'd love to see someone do a hack like this!
@_date: 2013-09-06 04:35:00

Gliph lets you both create a Bitcoin wallet (on Coinbase or BIPS) and also send Bitcoin very easily with people you're connected to. 
This video shows off how to send Bitcoin:

Thank you for expressing your concern.
Gliph does not host wallets. It provides a simple interface for transferring Bitcoin between and among wallets.  So far we have only open-sourced a project related to Bluetooth discovery of other Bitcoin users called [BTCSquared](  The core of Gliph is still closed source.
All of the developers on the Gliph team care about and have contributed to open source projects. And frankly, we would love to open source portions of the code, however in order to move at the speed we're moving this is not possible at this time. 
We also admire decentralization, and are looking at how we could decentralize aspects of Gliph. Gliph is still in relatively early stages of development, however, and again we aren't prepared to offer this yet.
Regarding trust, we understand skepticism and that is why we explicitly recommend folks with strong concern not store large amounts of Bitcoin in online wallets, including those connected to Gliph.

Gliph encrypts data over the wire via SSL, decrypts it in memory, then re-encrypts it before it hits disk using AES-256.  You can read more details on our [security practices]( webpage. 
Gliph allows you and your gliph mate to turn off password reset, (a feature we call [Lockdown Privacy Protection]( which means all of the data you share between you (such as why you are sending bitcoin back and forth) is encrypted by your personal passwords.  This means that only the two of you can possibly decrypt the data because it is encrypted using your passwords only. No one, including Gliph administrators can decrypt the data.


I'm not sure what you mean by this. Having successfully worked directly with Brian Armstrong, I believe Coinbase respects the privacy of its users and works hard to maintain the security of their Bitcoin.


Thanks. Texting and picture messaging works about the same as any other messaging app. Please let me know if you have specific questions.

Gliph has servers in San Francisco, Tokyo and Ireland right now. We did this in a major infrastructure migration at the start of the Boost VC startup accelerator mentioned in this article.
That change reduced lag a bunch, though I understand some people are still noticing it, especially on Android. Your own connection speed dramatically affects the time it takes to send and receive Gliph messages.

Please check the spam folder, as the email confirmation from Coinbase should have come via a Gliph Cloaked Email address. Sometimes Gmail flags this as spam.  If you are using an apple email address as your primary email address on Gliph, it may be that their spam filter is blocking receipt.  For more information please visit: 
If you are unable to get the confirmation email (please note, each time you request a new one, you invalidate all previous confirmation links), you can choose a new email address.
Log into your Coinbase account by using "Get Credentials" from the Settings menu on Gliph. This is accessible via the mobile web at 
You will be prompted to send another confirmation of your email address, or you can change your account's email address on this page.  Substitute your email address from the Cloak to your normal email address. 
Please note that when you do this, your new account credentials will be the previously set password found under the Settings -&gt; Get Credentials link, and the new email address you just chose.

Hey, this is rob from Gliph. Thank you bb for the note to come check out this thread.
Hey, I remember chatting with you earlier about this issue on the Support Gliph. I'm bummed we weren't able to get it sorted out.
If there are additional messages after the NoWallet exception, those might be relevant. But as I mentioned while we were debugging this together, this particular error is not related to the issue we're having attaching your particular bitcoin wallet on Coinbase. 
So far, we're unable to reproduce what you're seeing, and have not heard from other folks about this yet. In situations like this I make a note and listen on the Support Gliph for another report. We've been successful working some hard to find bugs this way.
For now, I recommend you create a new account on one of the supported wallets and use that for Gliph.

In its current form Gliph can not satisfy folks who have very high security needs. We realize the importance of encryption being open source. That is why we recommend other OTR services to those folks today.
Yet, Gliph offers a far higher degree of security than most messaging applications out there. We do our best to compete on a comparable user experience. I've found it is challenging to get technical people to set up, configure and regularly use OTR messaging tools. So it has to be accessible to people. 
We try to strike a balance between providing something your Aunt or uncle could pick up and use right away and still beat out the vast majority of other messaging solutions out there.

I can confirm that Apple has temporarily removed the Gliph app from the App Store. They requested the removal of the ability to send Bitcoin from the Gliph app.  (wallet creation, wallet monitoring etc still allowed)
WoodeWind is correct that the app did not actually technically send bitcoin, but rather worked as an intermediary. This did not matter.
We have a long blog post we're working on that explains in detail what happened and we're considering publishing our appeal letter.
You can still easily send Bitcoin using the Gliph mobile web app, and just go to the native one for push etc.
We're sort of waiting to get the app back into the store before going all out with "here's what happened." So if folks can be patient we can remove a lot of guessing about what happened with the facts.

:) We had a few of the cheese snacks "leak" the first day, but people have been pretty honest since. Of all the snacks you could take, cheese and salty bread sticks? (They were also the lowest priced item at the time, .005 btc!)

Hey there, I'm sorry to hear about that. You probably chatted directly with me. I think I remember our conversation. I said that we believe it is working on the Nexus 4 and that we weren't sure why it wasn't working in your case.
Frankly, and this goes for all of the Android related discussion: creating a great mobile experience for Android users is way hard. It takes way more resources than iPhone development and is basically an unwinnable battle.
Here's an example: right now we only support sending picture messages in the library from android phones. People ask, "why can't I send a photo I took from my camera?" The reason is that you have to write a lot of code to handle the way different android phones access the camera. When you solve the problem for say one major phone like the Nexus 4, you still may not have it working on the Note or some other well-sold device.
This is very frustrating from the perspective of a startup, especially when we can cover so many users on iOS so much easier.
I've further explained how hard this is issue in a blog post which you can read here:

Just picked up one of these babies. Thank you for making them. Will post a pic once we have it up in the Gliph office.

I don't mind at all. [Gliph]( is a secure messaging tool and a way to easily send Bitcoin payments. When you send Bitcoin on Gliph, you just attach it like a picture message to the person you're sending it to.
Everyone gets connected to the Support Gliph, which is an [official company Gliph]( Since everyone who signs up for Gliph gets a connection with Support automatically, it was just the easiest way for people in the office to pay us. 
Does that help?

Thanks for this feedback. We ran out of time. I'll try to get one that quietly explains what is going on. I do think this would be more helpful for some folks.

This was a pretty solid video. I'm actually impressed with its lack of negative bias, with the exception of the woman in the red dress who had not read the brief she was provided.

Hey there, a primary challenge is in offering an amazing user experience and a high level of privacy as well. We see securing data as an important component of providing privacy.
We agree that it would be better to decentralize trust around encryption of communications in Gliph. You do need to trust that we are doing this properly as of today. For people who require this level of security, we recommend open source tools like Cryptocat and PGP.
