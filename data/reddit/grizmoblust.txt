2. 26% Inflation

4. People who invested into etherum already lost their money. They will never see that money back.

They rely on the queen for mating. If there is no queen, the colony dies. Ants are similar to nazis, they are willing to die for the colony, for the 'greater' good. That's a centralization system. Their mind set is vastly different than ours. The ants don't question the system, don't question the authority, they are just doing their jobs. Like what police and military would say, "Just doing my job sir." That's why socialism work 100 percent in the ant colonies. 
Socialism is incompatiable in human nature. It has been proven. We have the capable to think, question, and other motives that comes to the play, which makes socialism very hard to implement. Humans don't like being push, shoved, or obey to the masters.

Well I think what he's implying is that bitcoin community wants to partake with politics, and beg the gov that it is okay to use bitcoin. Also, bitcoin users created crypto-slavery system called bitnation / bitcongress. This defeat the entire purpose of using bitcoin. From my perspective, the majority are eager to push towards open source direct democracy. 
Here's the thing, nobody is forcing you to use it. Nobody is asking you to use it. It is up to you if you want to use it. It is a voluntary opt-in / opt-out system. Majority of bitcoin users can't conceived such notion because they only perceive inside of the box. Ask the holy godvernment to grant you rights. Bitcoin is like a honey badger. It does not ask. It walks the walk. So it is a contradiction when majority uses bitcoin and ask permission.

Not all monopolies are bad. It was a natual occurance monopoly. Anybody can start their own business and compete if they don't like their service. You vote with your money. Plan and simple. The customers loved them, and thereby it thrives. 
The company managed to lower the prices of kerosenes. The gov stepped in, and had to bring the prices back to higher value so it allows other business to continue to make bad decisions. 


There is no absolute reason that it is okay for a group of people decides to step in, and distrup the market forces, for their own satisfaction. The transactions between two consenting parties was not okay accorance to the gov. 


The company was lowering the prices, to beat the compeition. The gov thinks it is unfair, therefore pass a law, to make it fair for themselves. The customers were willing to pay cheaper, efficent oil than other companies. Nothing is wrong here. Business doing business, as usual. 
I don't see how this is a good practice of preventing monopolies. Natual monopolies will desolve over time, as more competitiors find ways to combat the labor cost, improve efficiency, performance, and lower prices. 
What you pointed out, the laws itself incentives a group of people to seize and control the companies.

They don't know the future outcome but they'll do it to see if it aims true. It's the same thing for Bill Gates, he gave what the customer wants.

What makes you think we're in a bubble? I mean, I could see that but I would like to know your opinion. 
Also, I also believe it has to do with inflation. When you compare bitcoins to USD, bitcoins are always bound to go higher. Just like silver, and gold...

No. Democratic is where 51 percent gets to rule 49 percent. 
Republic is by the people, but again, it's almost similar to democracy. The only real difference is that republic allows you to choose who's your master and cannot force others to be under your master rule. Masters cannot force you or others to be in his rule.  You are his subject that you agreed via contract. 
 In democracy, you have no choice but to be a subject of a master that is chosen by the 51 percent. 
Bitcoin is not democratic. Bitcoin is a commodity that was innovated by the free markets, free people. Nobody force you to use bitcoin. You simply contribute to it because it was simple and efficient.  That's free markets. Not democratic rule. If it was, then bitcoin wouldn't been P2P in the first place. 


That makes a huge difference. Because you see, individuals now have the ability to decide. If he put democratic, then it would be decided by the 51 percent.
 "Sorry, I think 51 percent fee is the best offer. Any less than that is a criminal and should be hang. "  says the 51 percent.

You can't create bitcoins out of nowhere. It requires energy and time to create bitcoins. 
So realistically, it does exist.

Hmm thanks for clarify that out for me. 
It doesn't change the fact that Kim and his company are the ones who's holding the private encryption keys for you. It's good for certain situation as far we know it. In other situation, it just not viable, and it could affect your consequences. You are always better off to use spideroak, other client side party encryption apps, or possibility build a private file sharing network. A lot more secured. 
Oh and to clarify about the SSL injection, I meant SSLscript.

Anybody can be a libertarian/voluntaryist/ancap in the world. 
They simply follow one rule, non-aggression principle. If you do not support violence, then you simply do not support people who believe it is okay to steal your fruit of labor. The state actively steal your fruit of labor daily. Bitcoin simply removes that problem. You are guarantee to own 100 percent of your fruit of labor.
