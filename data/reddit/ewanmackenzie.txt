How would BTC transition from a store of value to a realistic currency? What do you think might back this adoption? 
My biggest issue is that BTC is not popular for utility but for all the 'investing' reasons you touched on. I think that to be a widely adopted currency, the price needs to level off. But if that happens, speculative investment will leave quickly. So for any kind of currency adoption there could be a huge price correction.

What are some of those ways?

Wouldn't it be possible people are less inclined to spend it if they see the value increasing in the future? 
With credit cards that can be us se at practically every store in the world, what is my incentive as a consumer (or business owner) to adopt Bitcoin as a currency?

I can't think of one thing (legally) that would be easier to purchase with Bitcoin than with my fiat currency. The transfer of money with things like e-transfers, Apple pay and Square is already very convenient. 
Being from Canada, I have a bit more hassle to use Bitcoin. It is almost certainly more effort to using Bitcoin to buy something than to use CAD.

Genuinely interested in what the communities thoughts are

I see your point, but Berkshire has employees, businesses, assets etc. A share in Berkshire is a small percentage of all of those assets, and maybe an invite to the annual shareholders meeting (which would be pretty neat). Ownership in BTC constitutes a private key, and that is about it. There is a big fundamental difference. 
Also, the ease in which I can trade stocks (through RBC banking) seems quite comparable to trading BTC. I.e. setup an account, ID required, commission fees etc. 
The reason I was suggesting something is wrong with the current condition is because popular sentiment says that Bitcoin is a good investment. My perspective is that it is a risky, overvalued investment.

Would there be any way to keep Bitcoin's volatility down? I agree with what you are saying but the big difference is that gold has remained stable for a loong time. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:15:54
I think the valuation would have to be stable first of all. If the USD was fluctuating the way cryptocurrencies have been recently it would be disastrous. 
Also, why has the price risen so high? Is it that more people, businesses and stores are using Bitcoin as a currency, or that investors are driving the price up? My point was that if Bitcoin isn't being used to buy goods/services then it is just another financial instrument that people are buying and selling.

Well as an investment tool increasing BTC prices is obviously attractive. 
And no, rise in popularity without an increase in price can be possible. Governments manipulate currencies in various ways. 
And by stability, I am referring to 15% intraday swings and a 3x increase since January. Imagine buying a car at lunchtime with BTC and realizing at 4 pm that you overpaid by thousands of dollars because of price volatility.

You said Bitcoin would realize value in ways not originally intended. I.e. not as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:28:23
Interesting to consider. Historically gold has been used as a 'safe bet'. People aren't looking to make returns but rather hold onto their wealth.
I think BTC is more unique in that regard. It is a safe place to hold value, but the value is changing very rapidly. It hasn't showed the same stability as gold to be a replacement as of yet. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:08:31
Do gold and silver need replacement? I thought it was centralized, inflating currencies that needed revision?
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:18:26
Well a 10k gold bar wouldn't be that big, but I get your point. I would still keep the gold though. It retains value.

What type/price of goods is it for?
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:07:15
The way I see it is that Bitcoin has value if you can realistically use it as a currency. Small transactions fees, easy adoption, convenience and stability. Right now I am not seeing those things.
Also, prices of fiat currencies are largely driven by supply and demand of imports/exports. When a country has goods to export, the demand for that country's currency increases. The demand is backed by real businesses, governments and individuals buying and selling real goods. Some of this is also due to speculation (that is people looking to hold the currency for returns). 
What percentage of BTC demand is from people who are using the coin for the transaction of goods and services. My guess is that it is a small few. How is this whole thing different than a bunch of investors fighting over 21 million shares of a company? People are not buying BTC because of its utility, they are buying because they believe someone will want it at a higher price.

So why are you suggesting it is a suitable replacement for gold if it's stability is impossible (at least for a long time)? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:09:48
Any recommendations on what to read?
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:07:20
By stable I don't mean flat. Just relatively predictable. To replace gold it has to be a low risk investment, right? Gold has its merits because in weak financial times it a place where investors can keep value without losing large. Not many people buy gold in hopes of big returns.
