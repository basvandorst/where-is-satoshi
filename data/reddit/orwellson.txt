If you think it's a bubble, put your money where your mouth is and SHORT it. If you're not shorting it, then go sit in the corner.

Key word here is "fraudulently." Simply cutting a coin is not illegal in and of itself, but doing so in the act of trying to commit an act of fraud or counterfeiting IS illegal.

I believe HODL was also made into a backronym meaning "Hold On for Dear Life."
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:29:31
HODL, is a backronym meaning "Hold On for Dear Life," originally coined in a forum post some years back when a person mistyped the word "hold." Over time, it's come to reflect the opinion, shared by a large segment of the Bitcoin community, that people shouldn't try to predict the market for short term gain and should, instead, let one's investment sit, regardless of the volatility of the market. The comparison to a roller coaster ride brought about another meme, the "Bitcoin Roller Coaster Guy."

I agree. I'd rather see transaction times remain the same, while scaling up proportionately as more and more people adopt the currency.

Let's not forget the internet itself was built as a decentralized system. With what we've built on top of it since its creation, would anyone consider it decentralized nowadays?

Exactly. This is about people (especially public figures like celebrities) who promote ICOs without disclosing that they might have a stake in said ICO. Standard stuff. SEC isn't bringing the hammer down any more than they do on stock IPOs.

Normal compared to what? Whenever I see folks comparing Bitcoin to things like tulip bulbs, bubbles and Ponzi schemes I roll my eyes. It's comparing apples to oranges. Bitcoin and the blockchain technology that underpins its security and decentralizaiton make it possibly the greatest financial innovation we will see in our lifetimes. I imagine folks said the same things about the light bulb: "light that doesn't require a match or candle? That's not normal." If we stuck with everything that was normal progress would never be made. After all, someone had to invent paper money and stocks. And sure, it could all go to zero tomorrow, but that's nothing for a sensible investor who hasn't overstretched themselves to worry about. 
And for those people who are convinced Bitcoin is a bubble: PLEASE short it or stop being the internet equivalent of the raggedy old man on the corner with a sandwich sign that says THE END IS NEAR!

Then most of the bitcoin holders in the US don't control their bitcoin. I take my bitcoin off Coinbase immediately after I buy for storage on a robust mobile wallet, and I'm considering a Trezor or similar. If traditional banks have shown a willingness to put customer assets at risk, then a healthy distrust of any financial institution (especially in these early bitcoin days) is warranted. If you are able to keep your funds on a hardware wallet, then you truly own your bitcoin and have yourself well protected.

I already have $$$ invested in it and I'm ready to invest more  as soon as the price bottoms out. Long term HODL is my goal. This is what both China and JP Morgan wanted: to inject some short-term FUD into the market, then buy low at mass quantities. The price will begin to rise as it has many times before, and many weak hands will be left facepalming themselves.

This. Coinbase, for example, asks for as much information as your local bank when opening your account, so it's regulated. IRS considers bitcoin property for tax purposes, so it's taxable (if reported).

I also believe that. But it could also be worth zero. Neither you or I should forget that. It's still an investment, and investments always come with risk, no matter how certain you are of how they will turn out. Also, make sure you stay on top of what is happening with Bitcoin and other cryptos. If you see another coin come out with a technological advantage that might be good to invest in, do it, if it's cheap. Bitcoin could simply be the start of something that another coin will bring to the mainstream.

They regulate the exchanges but they'd have to shut down the internet itself to stop bitcoin. So better buy what you can with what you can afford to lose before they shut down exchanges and make it nearly impossible to buy BTC.

thumbs up for investing in BTC. BIG thumbs down if you invested more than you can afford to lose. Be smart. Don't leave your ass potentially waving in the wind.

If you have all your btc on Coinbase, you don't technically own *any* btc, as they are holding it for you. Always move your coin off an exchange into either a hardware or paper wallet. That way you have control of your coin.

To my knowledge, ledger wallets are for holding cryptocurrencies only, not real euros or USD. if you're trying to move your euros or dollars off Coinbase, you should just have it sent to your checking account.

My best bet is that it will be tolerated as a store of value and for certain web-based transactions, but will be highly restricted for much else. But perhaps something else will (or already has) come along that will one day supplant the dollar.

From Wikipedia: 
Generally, designation of a particular form of money as legal tender means "that the designated money is valid payment for all debts unless there is a specific agreement to the contrary".[2] In some jurisdictions legal tender can be refused as payment if no debt exists prior to the time of payment (where the obligation to pay may arise at the same time as the offer of payment). For example, vending machines and transport staff do not have to accept the largest denomination of banknote. Shopkeepers may reject large banknotes: this is covered by the legal concept known as invitation to treat. Under the law, United States money as identified above is a valid and legal offer of payment for antecedent debts when tendered to a creditor. By contrast, federal statutes do not require that someone who is not a pre-existing creditor must accept currency or coins as payment for goods or services. Private businesses may formulate their own policies on whether to accept cash unless state law requires otherwise.[3][4]
The right, in many jurisdictions, of a trader to refuse to do business with any person, means a purchaser may not insist on making a purchase and so declaring a legal tender in law, as anything other than an offered payment for debts already incurred would not be effective.

It's going to take me at least a year of careful saving to get to 1 Bitcoin too. The important thing is you get in now before owning 1 Bitcoin becomes too expensive a goal to reach. I'm not saying Bitcoin is *the* crypto that is going to eventually bring the idea into the everyday mainstream, and I have thought about moving my Bitcoin profit to Ethereum and other promising cryptos, but I think it's a good investment at this moment because it's the current face of the revolutionary change cryptocurrencies in general mean for the monetary system. 
Lifetimes can pass before a qualitative change in a technology appears. Heck, even the internet has been around (in an admittedly embryonic form) since the late 60s-early 70s. I wasn't alive when the internet was "born."  Now it's a necessity.  We are still early days with Bitcoin/cryptos, and it's exciting to be alive to experience a *qualitative* shift in how we pay and get paid. 
Also, one of the major reasons the government invested in the internet, in spite of its potential to destabilize entire industries, was because it made doing everyday business over long distances quicker and easier than was available before. Cryptos have the same potential, but on a global scale. If a way is found to regulate a decentralized currency at its endpoints, so be it. I'm not trying to evade taxes, I just want a chance to have a decent retirement in 30 years or so.

HODL. Bitcoin is the future, despite short-term volatility. You're going to be kicking yourself in ten years when you realize how much you could have made, if only you'd held fast. My advice is to not look at anything bitcoin-related for a month or two. Then see what it's worth in late August/early September.

You're safe as it is. don't pay attention to numbers. A USD has the same intrinsic value as a Bitcoin: none. You're placing a bet on the future, and Bitcoin is the future. This is like pulling a bet on a basketball game with 47 minute left to play. Bitcoin has dropped much worse than this and it has always come back better. Stick to your guns and buy the fear, sell the greed.
