Robinhood app with zero trading fees? I hope these kind of endeavours succeed so that those that seek to hemorrhage bitcoin and profit from it go out of business.
If Robinhood does fulfil its potential then people will switch.

It may not be a bad sign either.  A more detailed analysis needs to be done. Transaction batching would also reduce count. Recently there was a block with under 300 transactions I think. If exchanges are implementing and adopting batches the same individual  withdrawals are being processed for far less and the lower tx count will be misleading.

How do you guarantee that both transactions get relayed simultaneously and are both part of the same block? 
People fail to understand that there are a bit more to this debate of 80 vs 40

Are you thinking of receiving Bitcoins instead of dollars or are you thinking of using a Bitcoin payment service like Bitpay and still receive dollars? The distinction is important because if you accept Bitcoins there is an element of risk you need to understand. Like accepting Bitcoin payment when it was $1100 and then having the price drop to $800 when you want to cash out to fiat. 
IMO until there is widespread adoption the price of Bitcoins will remain volatile and you will have to insulate your business from that. I totally agree with the wire transfer issues as someone who has used SWIFT transfers in the past.
Since in your particular situation your buyers preorder and use wire transfers buyer protection is the same in either case. CC users still have more protection though than you would get as a buyer using Bitcoins
