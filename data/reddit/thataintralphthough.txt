Can someone explain simply how i would go about doing FIAT-&gt;BTC trades? Do i simply link my bank account info or do i need to link my bank account info to a third party to do wire transfers?

What are the fees and limitations if any?
Edit: how would this effect reporting taxes?

I stayed away from Shapeshift because someone mentioned their high hidden fees. Can someone prove/disprove this?

As someone who is unfamiliar with multi-sig, can you link a place where an average joe can learn? (On mobile so i cant really research right now)

As someone who is not familiar with Ether or what's even going, can anyone ELI5?

I second this. After coming back and checking out the OB client, i would have expected an update that fixed this. 
Most listings for me (90% of the ) have NaN as the price. I have the same problem with trying to change local currency

Can Ledger be used with Electrum? Similar to how Trezor can be integrated with Electrum?
