Because if it's open source I can just compile it myself and side load it on my developer unlocked WP (it takes like few click of a mouse to unlock WP for sideloading, it's free) ;)
Anyway open source opens a possibility of community input which effectively could make it better and more secure. It also adds to trust deparment, it's like developer saying *we have nothing to hide*. Proprietary software while doesn't have to be malicious, cannot be fully trusted (I don't fully trust MS for example, though I trust it more than random company from Internet).

Paid like you're going to have to buy it to use it. My problem with that approach is not the app being paid (I prefer paid over ad supported too), but it prevents open sourcing it and I'm not going to trust my coins to a proprietary wallet (which also removes any kind of collaboration from community).

Can we now get a single, secure, offline wallet for WP? It's like the only platform which doesn't support Bitcoin, yet in developing countries where Bitcoin is the major force WP beats iOS in market share.
It's odd how Bitcoin devs just ignore it, even HiveWallet doesn't work in WP because there is an issue with encryption which HiveWallet devs do not give a fuck about.
@_date: 2014-09-30 04:54:21
My  concern is security of this venture. No backup, no wallet seed even - zero control over your funds and they claim right to suspend and terminate your account without reason.

BitTorrent Sync is closed source, ergo you have no idea what's happening behind the scene. It may aswell be a NSA project funneling all data to their servers... or not, but we don't know. 
In open source world all it takes is few people shouting at reddit or forums that this code is not secure, some other people confirm and suddenly project is dead. Hey, you can even review and compile it yourself, go figure ;)
What I mean is that open source (while still can be insecure) is more trustworthy than anything closed source, no matter who and how noble idea is behind it.

Easier said than done.
I suspect that people here have some basic idea about computer security (like, do not install random .exe from Internet at least), but most of human kind is not only computer illiterate, but also simply stupid (sad but true).
We need open and secure user independent solutions for storing and managing coins. Not rooted phones and tablets are good start, but carring all your money in your pocket is *great idea*.
Imo hardware wallets is where future lies, at least until older generations die along with credit cards and cash.
@_date: 2014-12-31 14:07:43
It's because Google is not selling software, but services in first place. MS and Apple are selling software/hardware, so they can't afford open sourcing their tech (or not all of it at least).
Also MS has cod camps and supports developers like crazy with free stuff and tools (especially if you are a student).
Obviously I prefer open source stuff (though I hate Google in general, it's the most dangerous corporation in the world atm), but it's not fair saying that Google is better in said way than Apple/MS - they just have different business models.

I've bought a Nokia since I used to love Nokia, it had Windows Phone installed... 
Honestly, if WP was open source I would not even consider other devices, it's really good OS, though thanks to it's nature a bit limited.
But imagine this:
**Cortana**: *Hey Bitch, you got an email saying that you forgot to pay electrical bill*
**Me**: *Hey Cortana, send 1 BTC to Electrical Bill Company*
**Cortana**: *Ok, I'll send 1 BTC to Electrical Bill Company, please enter your pin to confirm*
And so on.
I wish MS would integrate Bitcoin into their Wallet app, it just makes no sense to not do that now ;)

I think we should package Bitcoin related stuff with Linux/Android/otheropensourcesolutions ;)
I've noticed that among all the people I talk to about cryptocurrencies, number one concern (aside from usual bullshit like MtGox story someone heard/read in media or even lost money on as early adopter) is *but how do I secure my bitcoins?*
Linux in general (on phones or desktops) is more secure than Windows, just because of centralized software repositories as a main source of apps if nothing else (and we know there is much more to it).

Bitcoin is no longer work in progress, it's a perfectly viable payment system if transactions are fast and have low fees like it used to be when current block size was enough.


Because when I'm buying coffee I rather not wait 24h for transaction to finish and pay double the coffee price in fees.


Somehow not a single exchange, wallet developer or bitcoin related company states such thing in their marketing materials or terms of service, wierd.


If it will allow me to make payments without spending more on fees than on the product, why not? It's super simple to move between cryptocurrencies... also, spammers how? Can you elaborate?

Two more questions:
1) More like Twitter or more like Reddit? Or something in between? What I mean is that Twitter is more focused, while Reddit with it's subreddits (which creates whole communities) has wider approach to social interactions.
2) Porn? On one hand it could be great way for cam girls and models to get additional attention and cash, on the other whole service could easily become highly dominated by it (honestly, I'm fine with that :&gt; ).
Anyway, idea is interesting, but I fear You guys will get sued in first place.
@_date: 2015-07-22 20:54:20
Question nr one - is it centralized and if it is, how are You going to protect users and content creators from DCMA request and/or getting sued to oblivion by Google, media companies and all the lawyers in the world who make money on people who can't afford more expensive *suits*?
Question nr two - where does money come from, ads?
Question nr four - how are you going to prevent copyright infringement (like even simple reposting not-your-own stuff from other sites just to get likes and be paid)?
@_date: 2015-07-19 19:53:42


While this year is more stable, bitcoin value fluctuates a lot, so if you'll wait you may even lose some money if price goes down.
I would not bother with playing the market until you got more than you need for everyday stuff. Treat bitcoins like cash, just use it or save it depending on needs (and btw - fiat currency values changes too, one day you can buy X amount of stuff for 1 dollar, another day only half of that).

First - read OPs post again, cause you are making no sense with that comparison.  
  
Second - I've never said anyone is forcing me to do anything, just stated my opinion about Coinbase, take it as you want, but I really don't think there is no need to get butthurt about it.
@_date: 2015-02-21 17:25:28


  
What's the point of bitcoin in that scenario? Just use Paypal and don't bother with cryptocurrencies, cause the moment you start using Coinbase and similar centralized solutions yet again you throw away privacy and control over your money.
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:28:02
Well, if all the wallets are controlled by a company which has to abide to government regulation, then I call it a centralized solution which should be avoided.  
  
I understand the need for solutions like bitpay which help merchants adapt bitcoin in many ways, but legal business has to be regulated in order to protect customers, competition, taxes and so on (not that it works so great, but we got what we got). However, personal finance should be 100% in citizens hands and promoting something like Coinbase hurts the very idea of taking control over your own money (cause Coinbase can lock you away from your funds just like Paypal or banks, not to mention invaded privacy).  
  
Oh and one more thing - the fact that you expect protection from gov is the result of centralized solution. Just secure your wallets yourself and fuck corporations, it's really not that hard and it's worth the money (pun intended).

What coinvalidation? Srsly... GTFO from my Bitcoins. The biggest strenght of Bitcoin is decentralization. Some fuckin greenlist would mean Bitcoin would become centralized.
It's not about trusting those people or not, it's about not centralizing fuckin Bitcoins.

Same problem with Windows Phone 8. There is some halfassed third party blockchain app, but I don't trust random apps from random people, I'd prefer official Bitcoin or Blockchain wallet for WP8 :(

For the record: it is true.

I was just answering to a claim that polish gov has respect for people rights and shit, like they are good guys or something.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:19:48
Ofc you have to keep going and stuff, but it doesn't make my point any less valid.

You can always send some to me if you can't handle all those coins :)

What? The part about Bitcoin being a manipulation machine could be a good discussion topic, but astrology? :/

This is great, can't wait :) 
I'm up for some beta testing, but question is, do I have to unlock my phone for development first?
@_date: 2013-08-22 18:41:32
THEY are already in your phone, so it's too late anyway :)

Funny is how many people have that "minimum retirement" mate after 30 years or more of paying ZUS.
@_date: 2013-09-18 21:02:11
You're missing my point. We are not talking here about trade in general, but about gaming. 
Amazon is not a tripleA gaming company which everyone in the gaming industry respects, is jealous off and tries to copy :) 
Valve and Blizzard are.
@_date: 2013-08-11 10:39:44
Nice! Can you add wallet to your app with option to send and recive coins, QR codes etc? We miss good Bitcoin wallet on WP8 :/
@_date: 2013-12-21 13:47:28
I pay extra for most of that anyway. With globalised by Internet world governments have no place to exists. Gov doesn't protect from anything, so might aswell just not exist and let capitalism and corporate world take over, where competition matters (since gov is pretty much monopoly).

That's why they killed president and half of the opposition in cooperation with Russia :) 
Smolensk wasn't an accident, it happened only few months before signing a contract with Gazprom (which will last till 2035 and means billions of dollars) and opposition was fighting for getting a new deal with Norway instead of Russia. After Smolensk there were plenty of odd suicidies btw.
Fuck my government and that bullshit OP posted here, it's just a PR, nothing else.

It's kinda fascinating that as an IT director with experience in mobile field (yes?) you are not aware of fact that Windows Phone is second most popular smartphone system in latin america, has more users then Blackberry around the world and worldwide market share is growing at very high pace (78% increase of sales between Q2 2012-2013).
Also it's worth noting that all Nokia WP8 phones gets at least good reviews all over media.
Windows Phone is not going anywhere else then up, deal with it.

Fuck that, money are not just money. Whole world is driven by money and the only people who can say such shit like OP are those who never experienced poverty.
Money are pretty much the most important thing in life, because without it everything is limited.
Your life can be terrible with money, but it can't be good without it, simple fact.
@_date: 2013-08-24 00:12:27
Do it, every dev matters! :)

I would actually love to throw a poop at him. I encourage everyone to do that. 
That guy and his wealthy scared of Bitcoin buddies can go fuck themselves :)
@_date: 2013-09-07 11:29:46
Who says about bank accounts? There are investment funds and stuff.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:36:48
I'm not talking about Bitcoins man, but about importance of money in our lifes.
As for Bitcoin it's decreasing because of traders who are just panic selling after few rumours at Reddit. Price goes down and those who actually know how this shit works have to sell anyway because of that.
What we see at Bitcoin charts is a domino effect of human stupidity and herd mentality.
EDIT: I'm holding on my coins and I will be laughing hard at all those idiots in few weeks, maybe months :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:14:31
What? I'm quite happy when I have money and not very when I don't. Happiness for each person means different thing, but without money you are sooo limited that only people who ever experienced that can understand.


How about - rich has higher chance for living longer than poor?
You are full of shit and you know it man, go away.

I'm serious, thanks for the link.

Average retirement pension in Poland:
**200 euro / month**
Minimum rent for like 30m2 flat in old USSR dated buildings:
**100 euro**
Leaves 100 euro for: 
* Energy
* Gas
* Water
* Trash disposal
* **Food**
* Cosmetics, hygiene stuff, clothes etc
Unless you save money for your retirement outside of ZUS (while you still have to pay to ZUS anyway), your retirement will not be pleasant.
I love my country.
@_date: 2013-09-18 19:33:23
Now we need someone like Valve or Blizzard to do the same and everyone in gaming industry will follow :)
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:02:33
It's not voting time, but they need every PR trick they can manage, cause they are losing a lot of public trust recently (corruption, bad deals, bad economy... all the shebang).
@_date: 2013-09-07 20:33:40
Yea, perhaps they could start paying their 12 years old workers with bitcoins instead of rice!
