I got one, too!
is asking where they got the email addresses from. I can shed some light on that. The spam message I received was sent to an address that I have only ever used on bitcoin-24.com. That's an exchange that has gone bankrupt before and resurfaced later. here is a screenshot of the email I received.
The Bitcoin address in my email is different from the one that the OP is asked to send funds to, so I'm censoring mine out.
Here it is. Yes, ~~Global Advisors are~~ this email that claims to come from Global Advisors is obviously from a scammer. Please do not feed them.
