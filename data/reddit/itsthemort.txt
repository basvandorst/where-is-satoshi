My first week with bitcoin was when it hit $1800. I bought €60-worth. And that week I went through the whole "sweet im earning money. Shit it´s falling. Sell, buy altcoins. that was dumb. Get bitcoin AND altcoins"-phase. Now I´m hodling three different coins. Not with alot of money, but atleast I have something and I do believe in all three of them. It´s hodl and buy more-time! And I´m hoping actually hoping bitcoin will fall to the floor so I can buy alot more! Even if it were to be the end I´d be happy that I atleast tried, and I won´t put in more money than I can lose. Actually I consider the money "spent" when it´s not fiat.

Well, it probably depends on if you´re in it for a profit and what your budget is. The bitcoin-value is so damn high that unless you have a fuckton of cash(in my opinion) to go in with, you´re not going to get a real huge profit. That´s the reason I´ve invested in other crypto atm. I´m definitely going to have bitcoin in the near future, and I´m hoping it won´t skyrocket again before I can afford to buy some. I´d rather have 1500 of some other crypto at $0.3 that might go to $1 than 0.2 bitcoin that might double. Allthough my gut tells me that bitcoin is a safer bet.

I´m ready to transfer my stuff away from coinbase, but I think it´s ridiculous that I have to spend $2.33 to send it to my wallet.. The fees are waaaaay too high.

I meant the bitcoin transfer fee, not coinbase´s fee for sell/buy.
