Good point. It is only halfway through its production

I don't think it was luck for everyone. I haven't made millions, but I've been able to fund a nice life through Bitcoin just because I was smart enough in high school to see what it was so I got started buying and selling it and have been buying $250 worth like a bill for a year and a half. Just told myself it was a bill that was money I wouldn't get back and here we are now. The lucky ones are the ones that jumped on like 6 months ago for the first time. Haha

So just an update on this thread, I now understand more about Blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin and other CC and I have to say you need to be investing in these currencies. With the value being entirely transactionally based and off the number of people using it, things like the Cash App allowing you to use BTC is going to spike. Plenty of people store money in there and use their cash card where I'm at in Cali and if they made it with BTC that don't lose value like the US I don't see how it could NOT blow up. John McAfee (I think that's his name) calculates that if you take the number of productive citizens divided by the total available btc that will be made available the final value ends up being in the 10s of millions or higher in the end. Social Security isn't making it to my 21 year old body so gotta have something. I bought at below 10k, just hit 13k less than a week later.

Late sure, but lucky in the aspect that no one really expected that to happen as fast as it did.
