There's a thing called a Satoshi and it's worth 0.00000001BTC (about 0.00010956usd)

What is 'real money'? Paper in your pocket? Numbers on your bank account? Surely that is imaginary too. Bitcoin is a just like what your bank has - a list of bank accounts with values attached. Except Bitcoin isn't just a single bank's database - it's a shared database that you can use to give and receive bitcoins (and fractions of bitcoins!) from your own account.
 
There are only ever going to be 21 million bitcoin, so the value is driven by the amount of people that want to buy it and the amount available on the market. The more demand goes up, the more bitcoin's value goes up. 
Hope this helps give you some insight!

Now is genuinely the best time to get into Bitcoin because it has so much traction and has been around for so long. This means that it wouldn't be a happy surprise or complete gamble but instead something more of an investment - with risk, sure, but with the biggest possibility of reward I can imagine with anything! 
If Bitcoin becomes a global currency then 1btc could easily be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, because there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin to ever circulate (imagine the entire world's wealth divided into 21 million pieces!). And now it has been weathered and tested as a real, heavily used financial platform - with a market cap of $86 billion - every challenge that Bitcoin overcomes (and it has overcome every single one so far!) just increases the chances of it becoming a real, used currency. And, of course, when it starts to be used as a currency for sales transactions it'll see incredible gains.
It's literally the perfect time to buy and hold - you will regret it massively in, say, 10 years if it becomes new money!

There are cryptocurrency exchanges that allow people to buy and sell their coins at whatever value they choose. So if there are more people selling than buying, people will probably reduce the price a bit to sell faster. And if there are more people buying, prices will rise because there's a limited supply. There is a limit to the total amount of bitcoins that will exist and bitcoins are put into circulation by mining - this limited total means that there will be gradually more demand than supply, bringing up the value.
As to why people are attaching any value at all to bitcoin, it's because it is a technology able to disrupt and potentially fix what many see as a broken financial system in a transparent, decentralised way that no one person controls. And of course there is the mass speculation of the value: people see it is worth a lot and buy, and sell when it starts crashing - which is one of many reasons why it is currently particularly unstable!
