We all know how big the porn industry is, but WOW. Those numbers are big. My perspective on the outcome of Porn companies embracing Bitpay, is that it will cause a chain of other companies to jump on board. Slowly Bitcoin will develop an external support system. It's Vital to understand that once companies "teach" users how to pay with bitcoins (which they will, because companies make more money for not having credit card fee's as noted in the article). Then bitcoins will dominate and become inevitable, that our government, as well  as other nations will have to adopt and conform. 
Get ready for Bitcoin, it's the next big thing.

Dogecoin will never be embraced. It's simply a joke among coders and varies types. It's unstable, and has no linear objective.

Scare tactics, an argumentative fallacy. Classic.

This is very well explained, and used very easily understood analogies. Thinking of the fact that, Bitcoins are valued by (supply and demand) and realizing that 1BTC='s low to mid 700's USD, means that there is still a relatively fair demand for it. This is only the start of the stupendous growth we will see, as people become more attuned to the usage.

"I don't think", clearly not stating with certainty. Justify ignorance compared to uncertainty. Where are you coming from? lol
Edit; I posted this before an explanation was attached.

Elaborate and justify.

I bought 2 BTC at $850.00 and must hold now down $100. The market will fluctuate back up naturally. You just gotta hold as BC4U claims. The value of BTC is demand. DON'T GIVE UP!

You focus on the individual values of digital currency when flipping short-term. Long-term  you evaluate exactly what you're saying. By always researching the market and user base, you can "predict" growth patterns. It's about understanding external dynamics that work towards bitcoins success. For example; In one month, Big online retailers could take up to the idea, such as Amazon and would blow up market value. Or the reciprocal could happen.

I don't think you can actually reverse pending charges...

I don't think this will effect the markets much. Most people who watch the simpsons(not all) don't really follow the bitcoin hype. If it has any impact, most likely to be negative.

Justified.
