I don't know, it all sounds amazing to me. The automated collateral-based trading system sounds exactly like a debit card... Except this is trustless.
@_date: 2018-05-21 04:23:23
that's completely dumb. stef would just say "but what about the drug war???" and ignore the benefits he gets from collective pooling of wealth. then he'd say "well we could do all that through a gofundme for the internet!"
but he would yet again be ignoring how it doesn't matter that there's a drug war and no gofundme for the internet (lol). he's still living in Vancouver and not on a homestead like some libertarians are.
the libertarians that are though-- massive kudos for living your philosophy and I wish them the best of luck and hope they get all the benefits of living that lifestyle.

wow you saved so many people so much time by doing that writeup. I listened to him for years before he went alt-right.
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:46:56
could you post some kind of guide...
@_date: 2014-02-16 03:07:43
I like how you said you'd donate some of the money, as if this makes everything right about blaming bitcoin and profiting from panic selling. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 04:20:16
YES! Thank you.
I'm hoping the NSA employees will sell the data to someone who can really flesh out the good details, and copies upon copies will be sold. torrents will be posted. people will make money and the economy will probably improve. This needs to happen ASAP! Please spread the word, there is money some people need to be making!
Does this feel like too much reality? Embrace it, and spread the good word.
@_date: 2014-07-18 13:46:00


There are plenty of people that would disagree with you.
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:23:22
Haha I'm living in India off of bitcoin savings alone. 
Join the bitcoin India life.

How are you going to take electronic dollars? Don't banks have to allow you to run an exchange? That would mean it's regulated.. which doesn't really sound like the bittorrent of exchanges.
Sorry if I sound rude.
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:47:45
all you have to do is access through TOR, not provide any information, and pay with bitcoin. voila
@_date: 2018-05-13 07:02:44
marginal utility for the individual consumer. some would prefer to pay $1 to go through torrent websites with their ads and play minesweeper with torrent links.

So what you're saying is, people don't like variance. But there are plenty of people in private, smaller pools. It makes total sense for them to join p2pool, because they're not with G hash already for whatever reason. We just need these smaller miners to get the snowball rolling and gradually people will do the right thing and join p2pool. The tragedy of the commons will be reverse, people will be dashing into p2pool to safeguard earnings from variance.
@_date: 2014-01-13 04:00:27
You're not looking at the big picture. 
Tons of bad people are going to have written about their lives, and we'll know what led them to do it. The analysis will give us everything we need to know why people turn evil. Everyone who's had a shitty life has probably vented on the internet at some point. if it turns out those are the ones we need to watch out for (duh), we can move in on the war against evil.

Why not? If we find hard evidence religion causes terrible sexual decisions, for example, wouldn't policy of the future reflect that? The difference between this and the research we have now is that it's *hard evidence*.


This doesn't have to happen tomorrow. Technology will continue to increase memory capacity for reduced cost as well as increased data transfer speed. In 10 years, I'll bet people will have the ability to do this. The only assumption is that the data must survive, but if it's being guarded by the state, why wouldn't it?
@_date: 2014-02-16 03:08:58
Yup, no idea why you're downvoted. To the moon for you.

whoa thanks! i had no idea there was an atm close to me :)

Not to mention, they blamed bitcoin for something that was their fault.. causing panic selling.

I wonder why the graph on the article is wrong. I remember the price going up to a peak of $1200, not $800. Someone with a WSJ account should comment about this.

don't wanna say any more?

You didn’t receive bitcoin in 20 minutes? 
He probably lied, it’s under 1 minute every time for me ��

So? It gets posted when volatility is low.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:49:55
indeed. i cashed out and i got a buy order sitting for $250. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:16:04
Haha, this is also exactly how the stock market functions
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:35:35
yep looks like it's happening now to me too. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 06:08:30
Hmmm. Are they machine washable? Do they seem durable? $40 seems a bit pricey, but I'd help her out if the slippers were good. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:01:22
$40 billion is a drop in the bucket compared to what banks make, man. Sure, it's all riskless pure profit, but interest on vast amounts of debt keeps paying for maaaaany years. When people get loans, they also then typically pay someone for building something or whatever, and then those people put that money back into the bank. It's called a money multiplier effect. However, I did not know the profit from overdraft fees was *that* big. Thanks

$200 within this week
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:37:07
The funniest thing is, there's no fucking way this is how banks make money. Banks make money off of interest on huge loans to business owners. Getting little $20-$30 hits every few days, there's no way they could pay a small fraction of even their building expenses. Which leaves open a question-- why do they do it? Are they really that sadistic?
@_date: 2013-11-16 14:43:30
How would Coin validation be impacted by dark wallet? does anyone know? seems to me like the exchanges that comply with this are just going to end up getting boycotted, and merchants that sell from local bitcoins and whatnot will get to up their margin from increased trade. 
someone will probably need to create a new way to exchange coins back and forth, or find a way to make all the coins anonymous all the time like described [here](
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:12:47
I'm sorry, are you saying our current economy, which is full of monopolies and corporate fascism-- is because of libertarianism?
