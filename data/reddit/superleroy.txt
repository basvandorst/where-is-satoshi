With bitcoin, it's like, 10 minutes on average to get on the chain, and then 6 confirmations after that is considered "safe". 
Lightning network, segwit, and things like that are designed to help lower transaction fees and reduce the congestion on the network.

It's a token that can be hoarded or sent to other people. It is literally that. The technology that facilitates it is novel however. One reason it is novel is that it is actually decentralized. Anyone may participate in the network, or mine the next block, and receive TX fees and newly generated coins from mining the next block. 
It is not controlled by a single entity such as a government or company or individual. It has the risks and advantages inherit to various other peer-to-peer transactions
The blockchain acts as a public ledger, and you know what wallet has what bitcoins, and you can follow where the coins are going.
Now you have a method of sending bitcoins (which may or may not have value) to someone else, anywhere with a network connection (which means you could transact with people on a space station for example, as long as they have an internet connection) as a means of payment.
I can't find the exact quote but it went something like this:
If you had a lump of something that could be sent to someone else anywhere in the world, nearly instantly, but did nothing else, would that have value?
And what would that value be?
Right now it's $14,000 for 1 of 21,000,000 that will ever exist, and some of which will never move again to due people losing the keys that allow for their movement.

GoCoin is going to eat Coinbase's lunch unless they start adding litecoin and dogecoin support.
GoCoin already added cheapair.com to do it's LTC and Dogecoin stuff- and if that works out, I can see them dropping Coinbase and just sticking with GoCoin. Why do you need two transaction processors? GoCoin will do all three. That's going to be the logic of merchants.

Yes, it's already happening to the US Dollar, just much slower. 
Like boiling a frog in a pot kinda of slower. 
Compare the value of the dollar over the past 100 years.
Now think about the debt, and the ways the federal reserve is being cajoled into doing the bidding of the current administration (cut rates! The economy, and my re-election, depend on it!) when they are supposedly independent. 
If you cut rates too much, too quickly, you have no cushion for the next crash, and thus, we will start seeing negative interest rates. Which is already an experiment being conducted in other countries. Yes, negative rates, you have to pay money to have money in the bank. Insanity. The original incentive of putting your money in a bank? The bank loans it out, charging interest. The bank assumes the risk, and therefore only pays you a lesser amount of interest. 
Negative interest rate means, you put your money in the bank, you lose money, and the bank loans your money out at a higher interest rate and you get fucked.

Yes, and while you can look at that as a disadvantage, one could also see it in a different light.
What if SHA-256 is totally haxx0r3d and pwn3d by quantum computing (yeah, not likely, but what-if)
SHA-256 being broken doesn't mean that scrypt is. 
If SHA-256 were to become broken tho, likely the community would just adopt a different encryption standard tho, so not a big deal.
But overall, Litecoin does compliment Bitcoin rather than compete.

In addition, before litecoin implemented segwit, leading to lightning network, it was used to move funds between exchanges when the bitcoin mempool was clogged and fees were thru the roof. 
Want to move coins off exchange A to Exchange B? 
Change BTC to LTC. 
Move coins to new exchange, save a ton in fees, then change LTC back to BTC, possibly at a profit if LTC/BTC ratio swung in your favor.
Only problem with this scenario is the accounting of the BTC to LTC  swaps for tax purposes. The way I understand it, any swap from one crypto to another must be treated as crypto to USD, then USD to other crypto and you must account for any profits you may have realized. Not a lawyer or tax professional, but i think thats the gist.

The majority of the stuff I buy is on amazon or other websites. They will start accepting bitcoin and some select alts (litecoin, ethereum, maybe some others) someday.
It doesn't matter if the transaction takes an hour when the thing gets shipped later in the day.
LN will address the small amount/brick and mortar store transactions. Hell, even a $450 Costco run could be handled with LN. 
And 3 years from now, yes, Costco might start taking LN payments. Stranger things have happened.
I think Amazon is long overdue getting in on crypto. Overstock has been doing it for years now.

Maybe I'm waaaay off on the numbers. 
Here's what I found:
Price includes all labor, materials, equipment to complete a code compliant installation of
the following items:
16 Solarworld 270 Watt Mono Crystalline Solar Modules, 
16 Enphase Microinverters,
Internet monitoring device, and all of the associated switchgear, wire and conduit to complete the project.
I figured 270Watts x 16 panels = 4320watts = roughly 4.5MW? 
Sorry if I'm doing it wrong. :-)
This was back in 2013. I bet prices have come down.
@_date: 2019-06-09 23:25:07
I'm not. Power is expensive from utilities. And possibly unreliable in terms of they might decide to cut you off and not give you power at cheap rates if they find out you are mining crypto.
Most of the way you get off utility power is either wind or solar.
Or the idea of putting mining equipment at places where they just vent natural gas or burn it, instead you power a generator and mine crypto. win-win.
I've been a miner in the past, and I realized it was time to shut down mining when difficulty went up enough that i made less in coins than the power costs, on a monthly basis. I ran for a couple months underwater figuring maybe the price will go up in the future. 
I considered putting solar on my roof at a cost of $18,000 just to run about 4.5 
~~MW~~ kilowatt of mining equipment. 
Wish I'd pulled the trigger, made the investment into solar and kept mining, as the price went way up, but i was playing it safe. 
If I'd done that, I could have kept mining during the day, and had solar power and inverter and batteries and all that good stuff.
Would have been a great investment for the house, even if mining diff made mining pointless. No more $150 monthly power bills in the summer with the A/C running.
/edited because 4.5 MW is 4.5 million watts, and I meant 4500 watts, or 4.5 kilowatts

LTC is up from $22 bottom to over $130.
BTC is up from $3200 bottom to over 11,200.
I'd say you picked a good coin.
LTC codebase is similar to BTC, when they add mimblewhimble and other enhancements it will be straightforward to port to BTC. 
LTC doesn't have a million coins in limbo -- namely "satoshi's coins" that would rock the BTC price if they ever moved...

I love this comment, because finding a way to make the bitcoin network function between Earth and Mars might be a challenge since blocks take on average 10 minutes.
Radio communication between earth and mars can take anywhere from a minimum delay of around 4 minutes to a maximum of around 24 minutes.
Miners on mars would be at a significant disadvantage to blocks mined on Earth. And vice-versa. This could lead to greater numbers of chain-splits and orphaned blocks.
However, I think the Lightning Network would function properly assuming the TCP/IP protocol can handle 24 minute delays in transit (TTL will need to be really huge!)

Today, your point is valid - however merchants pass the credit card fees on to the consumer, and people don't usually realize it. It's hidden.
At some point, merchants will realize they can make more money off people who pay with bitcoin, even after fees from converting from BTC to USD. 
Merchants will begin to incentivize the use of bitcoin by giving a discount to people paying with bitcoin, which will offset the cost of the mining fee paid by the buyer. Maybe even more than offset depending on how low mining fees can go. 
When people pay with Bitcoin, Merchants no longer lose $0.50 or $1.00 from credit card company fees, instead they convert BTC to fiat, for lower rates than per credit card transaction costs. (often fixed fee + %)
Yes, they may risk the crazy price swings, but regular conversion from BTC to fiat, or some form of hedging could result in net gains for businesses (I could see a payment processor offering to convert on the daily average in the future, or some other method of smoothing the volatility)

it's about how the rules change. 
You said "timmy figures out how to make new $." That's like a rule change. Instead of only $10 in the world, something happens to make more. 
Here is a simple chart that should help people understand why [inflation happens]( Especially inflation after 1996 and after 1980
Think about the angle of that M2 money supply after the next recession.
Already the fed is trying to lower rates in advance of it. Everyone sees it coming. 
Regardless of personal emotions, feelings, or flawed economic models, safe havens like gold, silver, and bitcoin will become valuable as the fiat currencies of the world become worth less than the paper they are printed on.
(the metal in the coins are already worth more in some cases, such as the pre 1964 silver coins, if the price of zinc/copper doubles due to inflation, the penny will be worth more melted than it's face value -- $0.0060231 is the melt value for the 1982-2014 zinc cent on September 27, 2019.
