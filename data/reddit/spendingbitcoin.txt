Thanks for the feedback! We really appreciate it. 
* I'll forward the Alexa suggestion to our developer
* Already on our to-do list. We've already added a feature to show if webshops only operate in a certain country. The next step is adding where they are shipping from (and manually adding most of that data :()
* Thanks a lot! A few of them were already listed but most are new. Getting much closer to 1,000 thanks to you!
* We are aware of that bug, thanks for pointing it out though.

717 currently :D. We're very humbled to see the submissions pouring in. We didn't expect this kind of traffic in the first few days.

Thanks for the feedback! We have considered doing that but in reality it would be way too time consuming. 9 out of 10 website don't mention the payment processor at all, meaning we would have to walk through every checkout process. Only showing the ones that do mention their processor would look messy. Adding more details is on our to-do list, we're looking for a way to automate it first.

We've considered such a category but we could only find a handful of websites selling cars/houses etc. Those websites are still listed, just under a different category.

Thanks!  Our goal is to keep it as up-to-date as possible. Visitors can assist by notifying us when a website goes down, stops accepting Bitcoin etc. by clicking a report button. Visitors already have submitted dozens of websites since we launched yesterday, with currently 716 online stores in our directory.

We've changed your category to 'Supplements'. Welcome!

Here goes nothing! Good luck everyone.

We know it's not an ideal solution but debit cards allow people to use their BTC to make in-store purchases. We'd rather see more brick and mortar store accepting Bitcoin but that might take a few years.

Coinmap.org only lists brick&amp;mortar stores and LightningNetworkStores only lists LN stores. We list both 'regular' Bitcoin payments and Lightning Network payments, indicated by a lightning icon.
While searching for an existing directory we ran into websites that where incomplete, outdated and/or filled with advertisments, making it very difficult to navigate through the website. We created Spending-Bitcoin.com out of love for Bitcoin so we're trying to keep it as complete and up-to-date as possible. There will be no advertisements or hidden referral/affiliate links either.

Spending-Bitcoin.com currently has over 700 online stores listed! We have 1 goal: spreading Bitcoin adoption. We have no plans on monetizing the website so no annoying advertisments, no refferal/affiliate links etc. 
We are still polishing a few things and adding more features but we would love to hear your feedback. Feel free to add online stores if they haven't been listed in our directory yet.

Awesome! We've edited your website's page :).
@_date: 2019-12-10 20:38:50
Awesome design! We've added you to our online directory, hopefully you'll get some extra attention:  [
@_date: 2019-12-12 07:48:34
Done! 
@_date: 2019-12-12 07:49:54
Do you also accept Lightning payments?
@_date: 2019-12-01 08:32:19
We want to contribute to Bitcoin in general. Since there is a lack of good directories this seemed like a great way to start. Not everyone is driven by the thought of monetization ;).
