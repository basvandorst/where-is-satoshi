Wright is crazy and probably a genius too. To create bitcoin and mine it all by yourself for about a year before others started winning coins thus amassing his 1M BTC fortune you have to be a little crazy. Maybe i'm crazy too, but I think he (and one or two others he worked with) are Satoshi.  I don't know why, but i just think its him.

I always believe that the people who got into Bitcoin in 2014 are making off a lot better than many of those that got it in 2010. Too many stories of people losing Bitcoin for one reason or another after having got in for pennies or less. Those who bought in 2014 have acquired less initially, but seem to have held longer.

why would anyone outside of Venezuela care about MaduroCoin. Also, unless its on a public blockchain why would anyone trust it. For it to be backed by oil and gold those assets would have to be immutable also so that means Maduro lets them leave his control. Never happen. This is stupid. Buy the dip.

100% Wrong. Wealth distribution is the best the world has ever seen. the MAJORITY of the world's population has no access to stocks, bonds, bank accounts, 401(k)s, IRAs; Life Insurance, Health insurance or any of the hundreds of other instraments of wealth creation and distribution.  However, with a cellphone they have access to Bitcoin and with its appreciation they can create, store and transmit wealth as never before.

I think we go up big in the new year. if you want to move into Bitcoin now you most likely have to liquidate other assets which would involve paying the taxman in April 2016. If you wait to liquidate in January before buying into Bitcoin, then you don't have to pay the taxman until April 2017. Big difference. My price prediction for 2016 = $7,000.

i kept looking for the rest of the article.  It just ended so abruptly. Anyway, this thesis would value the entire bitcoin network and all its value at less than the value (market  cap) MSFT trades at today.  For the worlds first global currency and digital substitute for gold that value is way, way low IMHO. 6 or 7 figures is what i think the endgame is here, not $25K.

When you buy the video game I don't think you are "selling" bitcoin, just transferring it to someone else (the video game store) in exchange for the video game.  This may not be a capital gains taxable event. When Exxon buys oil to sell to you they must declare the income from selling the oil and pay income tax on that transaction.  I don't think they also pay capital gains on any increase in the price of crude on the commodity markets while it was sitting in their tanks. I'm clearly not 100% sure but that's my view of it.

@_date: 2016-12-29 15:39:46
I think the problem with your analysis is that you only treat Bitcoin as a currency.  Its much more.  At a minimum, its also a store of value.  Gold for instance is a store of value (one of many) and its "market cap" is about $7T.  So the theoretical upper range for Bitcoin should take these other aspects into account.  
@_date: 2016-12-21 14:36:33

I remember reading about the guy who painted the lobby of FB's first office and received shares instead of money for his work.  Was worth over $100M post IPO.  Bitcoin is in early days.

Here is what I think. Bitcoin price will rise dramatically very soon, like in the next 12 months. Once that happens many people who hold bitcoin will have profits to spend and will demand places to spend it. That's when businesses will come on board to start accepting it because they will fear losing out on that business to their competitors.

She started the piece by saying that Bitcoin is something she has recently gotten interested in. She made a joke about the virtual nature of the goat picture but she is a comedian, not a computer scientist. Her intro to bitcoin was meant to be light and funny but also educational considering her audience. She doesn't want to be blamed if they invest and lose money. Introducing the topic at all i think was great and commend her for that (and I hate all of Hollywood and most all comedians) so that is saying something.

The real property that will be securitized had real value. The owners will raise money by selling a portion of it to investors.

According to its CEO, JPMorgan is consciously committing fraud against its clients. It CEO has stated that Bitcoin is a fraud and by knowingly trading it on behalf of clients they are facilitating that fraud. Jamie dimon should resign.

Wow. What a rant. Jamie Dimon is 100% uneducated about bitcoin. He seems like the type of authoritarian CEO who whenever someone at JP Morgan probably tried to sit him down and explain it to him was laughed at or yelled at and they just stopped trying.

The SEC said ICOs are securities. Exchanges that trade them thus must be registered. Coinbase for instance doesn't trade any ICOs so this will probably not affect them.

@_date: 2018-07-16 02:25:40
Read the Strozk texts. The entire conspiracy is laid out there in black and white. The phony Russia investigation was meant as a way to try and remove Trump from office in case he won. That is a politicized and treasonous FBI ("We will stop him" and "working with Andy (McCabe) on an insurance policy in case he wins", etc, etc, etc.) I watched the Strozk testimony with an open mind and all I saw was a guy lying through his teeth ("no bias" ????) . I don't see how anyone can defend this. It should not be a partisan issue. Democrats should be as mad as Republicans at what the FBI was doing.

If you think justice is blind in this country then you are a tool. Read Strozk's texts and tell me you would want him investigating you if his tweets were about you? That is corruption more damaging to our country than some hacking.

Dude, your not making any sense.  If you want a politicized FBI you can make light of it now but you won’t be laughing when it’s turned against your party. Try, just once, to put country over party. Just once. (Also, I didn’t insult you, you started with insults, like liberals always do).

From Wikipedia:
Research into packet switching started in the early 1960s,[15] and packet switched networks such as the NPL network,[16] ARPANET, CYCLADES,[17][18] Merit Network,[19] Tymnet, and Telenet, were developed in the late 1960s and 1970s using a variety of protocols.[20] The ARPANET project led to the development of protocols for internetworking, by which multiple separate networks could be joined into a single network of networks.[21]

Looks to be headed higher now. Perhaps back to the ATH in the next few days.

How do you know that the price wouldn't be 10 times higher and that this is a crazy low price because of the backlog? Perhaps price does care?

They said crash will happen at 2800 and it did, right on cue (2805). Amazing.

I don't see a motive.
@_date: 2017-07-16 02:05:57
Perhaps it's my uninformed opinion but I don't think the scaling debate had been properly handled by those professing to maintain Bitcoin. This process has not been handled well.

@_date: 2016-05-04 12:43:42
What if Wright created Bitcoin but Kleiman was the one who did the mineing (not sure if this was stated already here, didnt read all comments). That would explain Wright claiming to be Satoshi but not having access to the 1M BTC to prove anything.  
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:52:38
as the price rises, whether they know it or not, most here will be in the same boat as you.

i agree but the fact that we cant make new highs with Brexit, Grexit, Venezuela, China devaluing, Blockchain being in every banks R&amp;D dept., etc., etc. is a little discouraging. We should be at new ATH now.

@_date: 2017-06-02 18:59:30
Don't get me wrong, i love this news and the recent run up in price. But.....with all that is going on in Bitcoin the price should be a lot higher than it is now.  Seems the scaling debate has taken a big bite out of the price and although we see it up we will never know where it could have been had this debate been put to bed 3 years ago as it should have been.
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:11:04
the debate over scaling must come to an end.

there is an old saying - never meet your heroes - for a reason. They never measure up to what you want them to be. I think it will be proven out in Bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2018-12-21 01:51:47
No one knows what the price will do and no one knows if this rise is real or not. If all the chart reading geniuses on Twitter or here really knew for sure they would be billionaires and wouldn't be telling us how we should read the chart. No one knows anything.
