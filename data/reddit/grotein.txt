It's not the fault of the futures market that the predominately young crypto audience doesn't know how it works. Hell I didn't know either before bitcoin futures were announced. We need better education and a concerted effort to make people aware to break this cycle.

I appreciate the explanation, but perhaps gold certificates is not the best metaphor to go with. One of the things that led to the collapse of the gold standard was the claims on gold supposedly stored in places like the Bank of England far outweighed the actual gold there.

Yeah. I get that the discussion is ongoing and that there's probably no magic solution to what I mentioned, but it is something to think about. I mean, somebody has to develop Bitcoin, somebody has to commit the code...it's unavoidable that some power will lie in the hands of few. But we should always strive to ensure that the future is not in doubt because of the opinions of the few.

Before the BCH fork, everyone was unsure of what would happen so Bitcoin's price was suppressed. The price immediately recovered after the world didn't end.
This time, with Bitcoin Gold, everyone knows that Bitcoin will be fine so they're moving their money into BTC to get free money (Bitcoin Gold), or because everyone else is doing that. Since Bitcoin is heavily bought right now, the price will likely correct after the fork when people take advantage of cheap altcoins.
Segwit2x is a different story and no one really knows what's going to happen until we get closer to the event and see if the NYA stays relatively intact.

The difference between this time and last time is everyone is on the same page about moving into BTC for the fork, and by logical extension moving back into alts afterwards. Everyone wasn't on the same page about August 1/BCH and China.
The only wildcards left are what happens with 2x, and will Litecoin/Eth/Monero be a safe haven if people start getting weak hands on an overbought BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:49:27
The amount they have invested will reflect their risk-reward matrix. A bank holding 1 billion in bitcoin might seem like a toe to us, because we look at the hundreds of billions they manage. However when that 1 billion is the riskiest investment they have by several orders of magnitude, and could also be the most profitable by several orders of magnitude, by their calculation it could be a perfect share of their assets.
Plus there's the fact that being in Bitcoin means a lot more than just owning Bitcoin. They are likely involved in researching the tech on many different levels. Who knows how many in-house teams they have working on blockchain related projects? We'll find out what they're doing now in the future.
