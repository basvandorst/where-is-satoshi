So what's new?
@_date: 2019-07-09 22:40:51
Thanks for the reply homie. Everytime I ask a basic* question it gets downvoted, though I suppose I could preface my desire to learn about the ins and outs. I am a big "fan" of BTC and seek to stay updated about the new stuff. I just checked out a book on it too .. just trying to spread the knowledge I do learn and consume as much new stuff as I can. Thanks again :)

Looks glitchy according to the reviews. I think I am going to have to wait it out for the next version they are advertising will be released soon.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:10:45
I think you fail to grasp the larger discussion his tweet portends. It is possible for candidates to debate center stage the pros and cons of BTC. The fact he doesn't like it is irrelevant and even opens up room for those who are pro BTC to enter into the debate.
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:07:31
and you wonder why nobody listens to you
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:11:55
I have googled and have found too much info and ask here because I have used this sub as a hub of knowledge in the past. Yet, when asking about this specific topic I seem to be trolled into oblivion, or receive answers that are irrelevant to my question - specifically, which app allows for withdraws of "physical" crypto rather than cashing out into fiat (dumb).
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:08:42
Isn't BTC a cryptocurrency? Why don't you gatekeep somewhere else. I have asked there and it was ignored like this post was too. Nothanks for your non answer.
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:05:56
I can't wait for you to down vote this. It is quite technical, as someone who supports the more economical aspects of BTC i.e. the decentralized solution to fiat and the political ramifications around the world I ask others, those who are more versed what the technical ins and outs are of the brand spanking new tech.
One thing this space has in spades is a smug pride. Don't get me wrong, I love BTC but it is not a friendly place to ask questions.
And, seeing as how Lightning is the second layer to BTC it seems like a great opportunity to present to others in easier to understand terms what is going on. But, something something build it and they will come. And, something something DYOR.

I don't want to downvote you because I don't agree with you. But frankly without knowing a persons living situation or when or why they are buying in, unsolicited advice is useless. I was having a conversation about layers upon the tech, and postulating how alts serve that purpose due to BTC's inherent limitations. What I heard in your response was to continue buying BTC (thanks) or consider putting my money else where.
I will go out on a limb and say you haven't sought out answers about various alts, and that is fair. BTC is so exciting enough to consume anybody .. but if I believe in the tech of blockchain, and what BTC has pioneered, I have to be honest about the developments in tech that occur. --&gt;There were waves in evolution in internet technology. Yahoo was the best investment ever, until Google came about, futhermore Amazon had a dynamic evolution - all of those are probably gen 1 and 2 internet companies. Soon the likes of Uber and Netflix come along, streaming and revolutionizing our daily lives, enter gen 3.
Is it a challenge to predict the future, yeah sure. But as someone who doesn't own cardano, I am extremely intrigued HOW they came to design their tech. Satoshi was a veritable genius, and knew there were questions he couldn't see that needed to be answered. AFTER, the genesis of a new era (like the internet first starting with AskJeeves for example) people started to ask themselves how can we make this experience better. I postulate, and am confirmed with their research, that Cardano asked HOW can we make global adoption a reality (banks the unbanked i.e. not me or you, 3rd world countries).
Im not going to continue to harp, BC it is a waste of time. You can DYOR and are perfectly entitled to your own opinion. I respectfully disagree with your dismissal.
@_date: 2019-10-10 18:47:34

@_date: 2019-08-03 17:54:36
I'm about as close to a maximalist as it gets, In love BTC. Though, didn't Satoshi say there would need to be other forks, alts, as the sphere grew in size? 
No, not all alts are the same .. and sheisters will sheister/rage/poop their pants .. but, isn't bch ultimately exhausting opportunity and offloading bad currency that will eventually be forked over to a newer better infrastructure?
As a maximalist I think it myopic to discount alts altogether, and I also watch what people do, not say. Rodgers subversion with his website speaks volumes.
Not saying I know it all, Im just enjoying the show as I hodl.
@_date: 2019-10-15 16:17:55
Anarchists are inherently anti establishment - yet want adoption from society. There is a gap in logic yes. If society has to use it, that means we have to believe in society enough to want to better itself from the banking establishment - not everybody is ready to let go of their ego at once. But dude, BTC is the best idea to come out of this millennium in a long time, if BTC fails all crypto will probably fail. Will the crown be passed down eventually, yeah sure, but don't start talking about succession before the crown is established.
@_date: 2019-10-15 16:56:31
Cardano seems like a really badass alt. I guess it is a 3rd gen. crypto and it is still yet to be born into reality. I think they only have a few centralized nodes that are about to start working out the kinks of their staking functionality, among all of the others native to their program. Full disclosure I don't own any Cardano, but I am likely going to start accumulating in the near future with my dry powder.
I am virtually all in on BTC, for the reason we agree on. That certain, likely specific alts are going to serve as layers to the progression of BTC/Crypto usage. Also, like LTC and even BCH.

Who is Hobbes, like Calvin and Hobbes? For that matter who is John Galt, and did anyone figure out who Satoshi is yet? JK.
I used to be anarchist, until I learned about the ego and eventually began to learn about humility. I am only here because of thousands of people before me who existed within this world, some would call society. Society is harsh, and can be awful, but it is also the reason for some of the best things we have at our disposal today. Without society, these anarchists wouldn't have anything to hate, and have no purpose in their contrarian life. Maybe they would turn inward and psychopathic .. that is an extreme example of a ruler measuring itself. At one point a person needs to understand their perspective is not complete, and that at some level we need each other ..  just my two 'toshis.

I like it, thanks you valiant steward. I'm the BTC guy at work - and I feel like I shouldn't broadcast im a hodler either - even though my stack is likely not as big as many others out there .. 
I hope to provide some business acumen to projects in development. I am an excellent spokesman about that which I believe in, and Crypto/BTC is a big one for me.

My posts about threats ETF's pose (effectively creating BTC out of thin air) get downvoted. Likely bc they don't coincide with, adoption narrative. 
I'm trying to raise awareness about the risks of financilization of BTC, the real threat, but it is met with scorn. 
No real perspective anymore, it has become a trope. All of it. I dislike Reddits rampant group think.

I was just looking at the Lolli website today, and saw they have what looks like 1000 business on-boarded with their platform. It is probably not new to you, but your project will need to differentiate from Lolli - probably think about branding, as well as on-boarding new companies to your platform.. what is the name of your project?

They don't have fees, but they buy your BTC at a higher rate than spot (I believe). For me, in the end it ends up being similar to a fraction of a percent in expense. Nothing is free, I would argue the exchanges are all competitive. If they use KYC it's all the same.
That said, I use CashApp and just switched to Gemini from CoinbasePro.

I see the Metal Cards offered by crypto.com filling that gap. I am a pragmatic guy, and a small business owner. I feel like onboarding via an already vetted device (spend/charge card) is easier than creating a new infastructure.
I know that running a small business, or medium size business, they don't have time to develop infrastructure (accounting,taxes, fiat/crypto swaps) .. they have beer to sell and burgers to fry, plus Stacey and Jame's drama to handle. They frankly don't have the capacity to care.
I know this is very contrary to the vision we hope for, that I hope for, but it is a reality to small and medium sized businesses. Unless it is made easier rather than harder to implement, most will not adopt.
I feel I need to voice this, so smarter minds than myself can begin to tackle this. Like, there needs to be an automated tax calculator built into the infrastructure of a POS transaction with BTC that allocates the appropriate amount of taxes into a dedicated wallet or something. BC, eventually that business will need to swap Crypto to fiat, BC currently that is what ALL bills are paid for with.
Do you see the dilemma?
@_date: 2019-10-10 07:07:46
I was just making a post on r/Bitcoin about how I too can help with adoption. I am a business minded guy with a very strong passion for Crypto/BTC. I took C++ but realized I should let the coders code while I stick to business and finances. 
I am very serious about wanting to give back to the space, and I feel like I could be a good candidate to help in this phase of your development. What are some of your tasks, goals, direction, mission? Do you have a business plan or any sort of financial statements/accounting?

BTC is the best crypto - it is the most beloved imo. It will be the gold standard of crypto while other functions are built around it - like layers. I love BTC, but I am rational enough to see the limitations in its technology.

This is a great list - and I am going to research which one fits best for my in my current life circumstances.

I got in around summer 2017, while I survived my first crypto winter I still have some milestones to achieve. I too have sold some for pragmatic reasons - which to me proved its ability to be used as a currency, only one of its applications as you pointed out..

@_date: 2019-10-11 10:55:17
You will need to find that information on your own. That is the best way to learn (when we say DYOR, do your own research - that is what we mean). I would recommend downloading both apps and trying both of them on for size. I know it is easy to look up CB's fee structure, and if you make a trade on Cash you will see, before the trade is finalized and submitted, the rate at which you are about to trade. Good luck, and happy crypto-ing!
@_date: 2019-10-11 11:05:44
Lol, thanks for the push. I am a business guy, I do well with forecasting and I can see trends very well. I have been following the crypto space for some time and see a very big need, and am in development of how to implement this from a small business, consumer, finance, solutions oriented, marketing, imaging/perspective. 
I love Crypto/BTC, and I took one C++ class which was enough to tell me I am not a programmer at heart - but I can run a successful business with a shoestring budget and quite a bit of acumen. I hope to incorporate that into the space somehow. I know I am not something that extraordinary, that there are many business advisors in the space, but I have some really cool ideas that I think could help projects.
Until I get this project off the ground, I am still voraciously consuming information and I think I could become a free lance writer/content writer to start providing back to the space - providing education as many have pointed out, while also gaining more education and resources myself and hopefully finding a track to follow that leads to something sweet. 
Those are my two Satoshi's on the matter. Hope you have a good morning. Can I ask you, why did you ask if I was serious? I hear your POV, "stay in your lane," it makes perfect sense.

Is it possible for me to come into contact with these tainted coins? It seems like that would not be desirable to deposit on an exchange that tracks them, due to money frozen/stolen. 
How do I prevent myself from buying a toxic coin, or acquiring one through commerce? Or, is it even a big deal?
Seeing as there are only so many sats out there it almost seems redundant.

Well, if BTC is used for a store of value, like gold (almost like a digital gold) than using bakkt and its products IS a use for its price discovery .. just my two satoshis.

Isn't the cash app an answer to moving BTC in a scenario like that? I send you BTC via the app, we wait for the verification, you give me cash.. am I missing something? Have you used the app yet? It is a very good app, I use it all the time. Also, I do not work for the cash app, etc.
Just looked at my version of the app, it does indeed include a deposit and withdrawal function. Also, I buy my coin from my debit card, using this app instead of coinbase. People should know about this app more.

That's not true, 77 contracts x 9900(ish) = 3/4 of a million dollars first day. I was listening to a report on the "customer" who would use bakkt - these are conventional (ie conservative investors, very risk averse). They are going to wait to see what happens, they are probably waiting to see what this triangle (being picked apart by every TA) is going to do, like the rest of us.
