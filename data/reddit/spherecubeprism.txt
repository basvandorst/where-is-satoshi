I literally was told that it was unused. I don't know what p2sh is. Then I made a post on asking if people used Segwit to confirm my thoughts and everyone kinda gave me non-answers. Top comment was a big fat "No."

I have tried that. It's Mycelium. I got some other guy to send me dust and it didn't appear. This same exact address worked before, however, I can't even view that address since the app won't let me view old addresses. 
Edit: After refreshing a dozen times, I click "reload account" and now it shows up. Weird, eh?

I don't really like the price update posts when it's right at the tip of a new ATH. The price is usually lower the rest of the day afterwards.

Do you actually have no regrets? ..
Like, I'm not a druggie so I wouldn't know. But, literally anyone who does drugs has regrets, right? Or maybe I'm just around the cynical people lol

I kinda have to use an exchange. It's like needing to have a bank to use an ATM.

Hey, thanks for the one bitcoin from the other day man, that was really sweet of you.

Strawpoll doesn't really care or track the IPs of any one particular survey though.

I was out from bittrex's exchange, I couldn't change the fee.
