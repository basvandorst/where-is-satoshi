Hi, I am looking to buy a bitcoin. I lost my job in October &amp; only collect unemployment &amp; I don't have a bank account. I can do money orders? Let me know. Thank you.

Happy Birthday! It was my grandma's birthday yesterday, but she wanted a pie :( This is the best I can do! 
Here is my address if you accept my pie!

Oh yes, for sure I'm looking for a job every single day. All I really want is to own one bitcoin. So hopefully once I do get a job, I can buy my coin and get on with life. Maybe buy 1 coin per paycheck. Thanks for that link by the way.

I don't have a bank account and I own approximately 0.88 cents in BC. I am looking to just buy 1 coin. I lost my job in October so I have unemployment. If anyone out there would like to sell me a coin, I will gladly mail them a money order on Tuesday, as the money hits my card Monday night.

How can I earn Bitcoins? I would buy some, but I am currently laid off from my job &amp; my unemployment ran out in May. So I'm lookin to get BTC anyway I can. I don't even know what a bitcoin faucet is, so if you could tell me how to earn bitcoins, that would be fantastic. Thank you.

Yeah I understand. It seems so hard to get a coin. I only want to invest in one, which I can afford. Thanks for the advice Blink_y79. :)

How do I transfer the 0.80 cents to my block chain wallet?
