Of course he does. Such a hack

I get what you’re trying to say but that just isn’t reality. Applying for a credit card is easy as can be. And the reason you have to apply for one instead of just buy stuff with a free card is because the banks make sure you aren’t paying for things with money you’ll never have. That is inherently part of the understanding and trust in banks and payment methods that they monitor and approve. Bitcoin has no do over button. You send money and it’s gone. You accidentally type an extra 0 when you’re paying and you just lost a crap ton of money. With credit cards, part of the agreement with the bank is for security of your funds. They make sure that your payments aren’t being made by someone else or if you make a pending credit card payment, you can instantly call your bank and tell them to cancel it.
It is not only easier to use because of its establishment in our society, but also because you have an institution backing you up and protecting you from loss when using it. If you truly think that it would be easier for your grandpa to send you a payment as a gift with bitcoin instead of taking his phone and using Apple Pay then I don’t know what to say. I guess I just disagree. I doubt you really believe that’s where Bitcoin is at now.  Of course, the potential for it to be easier to use for the masses is there and that’s where it’s future value in terms of widespread payment use is going to be key in its potential value. I just doubt it ever gets to the same point where other currency is at. I don’t it even gets close to be honest. And this is coming from someone who’s invested in it and would like to see its value rise.

I highly disagree that it is easy for anybody to use Bitcoin for actual day to day payments. For the mass public, the entire process is not easy. For technologically savvy people, maybe it is. But for the masses, it’s not even close to easy. And the demand hasn’t been there when it comes to its use. The majority of its demand has been in its investment value. I don’t see that changing. And again, that investment value demand is completely based on speculation of the things you’re saying ARE the reason people buy it. The reality is that it is speculation of what Bitcoin CAN be.

What will drive up the 12 month average of the price by 50+%? Banks and business adopting it and allowing legit usage over fiat? Money laundering? Devalued currencies?
My bet is it will just be hype or they will make it an easier asset to store and manage without having to keep it on hard drives and write codes down to access it.

I understand that hypocrisy is on full display here. However, it’s important to keep in mind that this bank was CAUGHT for money laundering. They likely were not against money laundering as they stated when saying they stood against Bitcoin. They were against Bitcoin because it took away from THEIR ability to profit from money laundering. If you’re using Bitcoin, it is FAR EASIER to launder money compared to fiat currency. 
So the takeaway is that this bank is extremely shitty, hypocritical, immoral, and dishonest. The takeaway is not that Bitcoin has lower risk to be used for the purpose of money laundering. In fact, I suspect that a surprisingly large portion of the transactions are currently being used routinely for money laundering and/or other irregular illegal uses. So banks that don’t want to support crypto transactions are not incorrect in having the concerns that they do.

Yep. Instead you could have sold your gains and had more money to buy back at a lower price if you chose to

It’s posts like these that make me question if people who also like Bitcoin are mostly Libertarians that don’t know what they’re talking about.

So would people agree that HODL was not the best investment strategy if you owned BTC before it blew up around this time last year?

You’re better off buying a scratcher at the gas station.

Only this subreddit would act like the results of a Ron Paul poll mean something

That guy is a true POS. You really want to quote him?

The US dollar didn’t shut down though so this point is irrelevant. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:37:11
What does that even mean?
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:44:45
What about human brains?

I’d still rather use cash.

It’s all my fault BTC is down because of my Reddit comment. I’m so sorry!
