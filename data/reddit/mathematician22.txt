A permissioned blockchain is about as useful (or useless) as a private database.  
We are already seeing how easy it is for centralized digital service platforms to exclude any voices of dissent.  Why would I place my trust in a 'permissioned' digital financial platform when my permission to use it could be taken away from me at any moment?  This guy does not understand the relevant part of the tech.

Dust: If the fees to spend a transaction output (determined from the size of the output and the input required to spend it) would cost more than one third the value of that output, the output value is considered dust. Transactions with dust output values are considered non-standard.
Min Non-Dust: The minimum non-dust value is the least value one can send without the output being flagged as dust. The minimum output value for a P2PKH is currently
546 satoshis. This minimum threshold value changes depending on the script being used.
Bitcoin core uses a dustRelayFee of 3,000 satoshis/kilobyte.  P2PKH script size is about 182 bytes, thus 546 satoshis is considered dust.

The public is not interested.  The people that used to be interested, are no longer.  There are technical reasons as well, in that it is too sophisticated for 99.9% of people to even bother with.  The blockchain will grow without bound, which is becoming a problem, and will be a bigger problem in a few years from now.   
There is a stronger US dollar now (supposedly?) but the threat of bank account confiscation is still very real.  We may see a resurgence of bitcoin use if/when they begin confiscations in the US.

Are there any links to technical details of this plan?  I am worried about a pool operator finding a way to distribute the second proof-of-work to the rest of the pool in a way that keeps the private key private.  For example, maybe the pool operator can find a way to solve the second proof-of-work using only a hash of the private key.  
Also, how and when is the second difficulty adjusted??  It seems the second difficulty would have to be based on the size of the largest pool in operation?

Academia is incredibly behind when it comes to cryptocurrencies in general, because the field is so new.  
The problem is that mathematicians and computer scientists become entrenched in their own subfields and subproblems and subapplications and subpapers that they are completely oblivious to major breakthroughs in technology that create entirely new fields of study.
Cryptocurrencies will forever change the field of computational mathematics, but do mathematicians realize this?  Absolutely not.  Keep calm, and mine on.

"Virtual Currency means any type of digital unit that is used as a medium of exchange or a form of digitally stored value or **that is incorporated into payment system technology**.
Virtual Currency Business Activity
means the conduct of any one of the following types of activities involving New York or a New York Resident:
(1) receiving Virtual Currency for transmission or transmitting the same; 
**(2) securing, storing, holding, or maintaining custody or control of Virtual Currency on behalf of others;**
(3) buying and selling Virtual Currency as a customer business;
(4) performing retail conversion services, including the conversion or exchange of Fiat Currency
(5) controlling, administering, or issuing a Virtual Currency."

Difficult to use? Don't be ridiculous!  All you have to do is create a bootable USB of ubuntu that will never connect to the internet, install Armory, create wallet, backup wallet to piece of paper, create watching only copy (for use on your regular machine which is considered vulnerable if it is connected to the internet), and then generate your addresses that are associated with that wallet, and BAM! You have yourself a wallet. 
Step 2:  Get bitcoin somehow to that wallet.  (Good luck with that)
Step 3:  To spend your coins it's as easy as:  creating an offline transaction on your compromised computer and send that text file to your USB-bootable ubuntu setup where the actual wallet file resides so you can SIGN the transaction and then bring that signed transaction back to your compromised machine and broadcast the transaction to the bitcoin network.

So that fee of 264.69 sat/Byte is outrageously high.  Normally, you can get away with a fee of 20 sat/Byte and get your transactions confirmed.  During times of low mempool, you may be able to get your transactions confirmed at near 0 sat/Byte. 
The size of the mempool is more volatile than the price of Bitcoin itself.  It has been fluctuating wildly over the past 6 months, and during the recent hardfork transition the mempool was quite low (allowing 0 sat/byte transactions to gain confirmations).
You have the option to include any fee you want (even 0).  The higher the fee, the sooner you can expect the transaction to be included in a block.  Right now the mempool has bloated in size once again as many transactions with very low fees are floating around trying to get confirmed.  If you really want to split these things up, you have to decide what the appropriate trade-off is between time and fees.
My advice:  Don't split them up.

To be more technical:  If you buy 1 btc for $4000, and in the future, the price of btc is $5000, and say you purchase a $1000 item, that is .2 btc, you have sold .2btc at a price of $5000/btc.  Your cost basis for that .2btc was really $800, so you should declare a $200 profit.
If you MINED that 1btc instead of buying it, it gets a little more complicated to figure out what your cost basis actually is.

"But there’s no getting around the fact that Bitcoin is essentially a speculative investment in a new technology, specifically the blockchain."
And Federal Reserve Notes are essentially a speculative investment in old technology, specifically central banks.
The entire Amber/Flies analogy is off-base.  Both the amber and the flies are valuable.  To say that one of them inherently is more or less valuable than the other requires a far lengthier discussion and serious research.
"We should expect similar anti-money laundering hygiene and taxation among the cryptocurrencies."  Bitcoin currently is treated as capital gains, much like an equity which the author seems to agree it should be classified as.
"The more electronic security layers inherent in a cryptocurrency’s perceived value, the more vulnerable its price is to such an eventual decree."  No.  Not at all.  In fact, it is probably quite the opposite.
"As a new cryptocurrency is assigned units of a store-of-value, those units must, by necessity, leave other stores-of-value, whether gold or another cryptocurrency. New depositories of value must siphon off the existing depositories of value. On a global scale, it is very much a zero sum game."  This is simply not true at all.  The free market and individual/institutional decision making is what determines the value of any financial instrument.  This process is not a zero-sum game.
"However, unlike physical assets such as gold and silver that have unique physical attributes endowing them with monetary importance for millennia, the problem is that there is no barrier to entry for cryptocurrencies;" None whatsoever, it is up to the market to decide what these cryptos are worth.  Oh by the way, the market determines the price of gold and silver too. 
"This insurrection against government-manipulated fiat money will only grow more pronounced as cryptocurrencies catch on as transactional fiduciary media; at that point, who will need government money? 
Holding Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies likely constitutes a bigger bet on the same central bank-driven bubble that some hope to protect themselves against."

I think it's an interesting discussion to have:  whether the market cap number has any real meaning or not.  I think on the one hand you have good points about Bitcoin not being a "company" and therefore has no revenue.  But on the other hand, Bitcoin is something that evolves and changes over time with new features and new adoptions, as well as new mining hardware and resource consumption, increasing its value proposition, and consequently its "market cap".  
I think the definition of "market cap" as the number of coins * price still makes some sense to use as a metric.  When you consider the entire "market cap" for all cryptos sitting at $130+ billion, it really does feel like we (as a society) have only just begun this financial journey.

Yea, I ended up getting most of my btc back (lost some to fees of course).  What happened to me was, I sent the transaction but it took longer than 30 minutes to get included in a block, so my overstock order got canceled and then it was included in a block, so yea had to deal with customer service to get the refund, but it did eventually come through on Coinbase.  
This brings me to another point about how most companies that say they "accept bitcoin", don't REALLY accept bitcoin, they almost always use a third party like coinbase or bitpay, and the company only sees dollars coming out on their end.  It's not true bitcoin adoption and that annoys me.  But, and even with a price of $4,000 a btc, this just illustrates how far we still have to go with society embracing crypto payments.

You shouldn't get hung up on thinking of Bitcoin as a currency.  It's the first planetary wide, unstoppable, uncopiable, digital peer-to-peer token exchange system with a fixed number of tokens that exists entirely outside of the "established" financial system.  It's useful.  Especially when the use-cases start to become more data oriented (i.e. using the blockchain for verifying documents and ownership of real-world assets).  It's a distributed database with an unalterable history.  
To quote Antonopolous:  "Currency is only the first application."

I'm not sure what you mean exactly.  If you are talking about referencing dust values as inputs in order to perhaps consolidate them into a single output, the rules I stated above still apply.  The transaction output still needs to be larger than 1/3 the dustRelayFee, and referencing multiple inputs will make the transaction larger in size.

Most Americans don't see a point in converting US dollars into magic internet moneys, period.  I know we all like to tote how "easy" it is use bitcoin, but real transactions can take an hour, and it is difficult to use (at least to use securely).  It's waaaay too late for the public to mine them on their own (in any meaningful amount), and so people have to rely on exchanges (or local bitcoins), either way there are markups on the "spot" price, heavy volatility (although we seem to be in a nice "mid 200's" area this year), and trust issues.  
Bitcoin is also surrounded by controversy with scandals like the silk road and hacking heists, etc.  I'd say it carries a certain stigma with it.  
What concerns me is the ever growing size of the blockchain.  I fear that eventually this, if nothing else, will be bitcoin's downfall.

being pro-segwit is dumb, it doesn't increase blocksize and forces everyone to use a p2wh script type.
@_date: 2017-05-29 00:44:40
I'm not intereted in Segwit.  I want to see the blocksize actually increase.  I don't want input data to be stripped out of my transactions when stored on the blockchain.  Data storage on the blockchain can only be done efficiently if stored in the input scripts.  Segwit is a hack that doesn't solve the long-term problem of blocksize while removing features such as data storage on the blockchain for users of bitcoin.  I am definitely anti-segwit.

Not according to Segwit.  Once a transaction has been verified at SOME POINT, it doesn't matter if you keep the input script around or not.  This is exactly what Segwit is going to do.  People in the community don't really understand this.

Bitcoin was promoted with many overinflated promises that it does not deliver, but it is disruptive technology.  It FORCES banks and competitors to innovate.  Bitcoin has the first-mover advantage in the crypto space, but has been gradually losing more and more of the market share to competing cryptos that address Bitcoin's shortcomings.  
In fact, I have found, that if you sit down with an intelligent person that has had their head in the sand for the last 8 years, and you explain Bitcoin thoroughly, they begin seeking out altcoins (on their own!) that address whatever issue they are most concerned with.
Ex:  One friend of mine is most concerned with anonymity and uses Monero (and now knows more about Monero than I do).
One friend of mine is most concerned with the slow confirmation times and opts to use litecoin.
Yet another friend of mine wants smart contracts, and is all in on ether.
And the fourth person I know is concerned about governance structures and is pro-Dash and steemit.
Seriously.  I am surrounded by people that flee from Bitcoin because of the now high-cost of entry, the drama around segwit, and the fact that... yes, it really does suck to use.
On the other hand, Bitcoin has stood the test of time (so far).  It has the most computational work behind it, first-mover advantage, and has now basically become a household name.  Bitcoin is sensationalized in the news constantly, which has been a boon for us, but new players coming into this space are not flocking to it, and people who think that Bitcoin will reach $10,000, $50,000 etc are not performing their due diligence.

@_date: 2017-07-07 09:01:34
I like your skepticism, keep it coming.  
The reason the first transaction is so large is because that data is storing a .gif files in the litecoin blockchain.  This is exactly the kind of data that the developers want to purge from the blockchain proper, and store these kinds of transactions in a separate (witness) block that can be thrown away after it serves its purpose of transaction verification.
To directly answer your question:  The Bitcoin community seems to have spoken, and has decided  "No.  The witness data is NOT the most important part of a transaction."  This is because if the script execution results in "TRUE", and at SOME POINT IN TIME "everyone" agrees that it resulted in "TRUE", then we don't need to save part that serves as verification.  The network agreed it was true at some point, so there is no need to re-verify the script.  
If you are trying to store arbitrary data, the important part of the transaction is the witness data, that's the most efficient place to store such data.

Segwit strips out input data and transactions stored in the blockchain have "empty" input data when added to a proper blockchain block.  Blocks are still 1 Mb, size does not increase, but more transactions can be stored in the blocks if input data is stripped.  
Input data is saved in the "witness" block, which is not stored longterm in any chain as far as I know.

 You can click an address in armory and select "view address keys", which will display the base58 and hexbe formats you describe.  Be sure to eliminate any spaces that they show, there should be no spaces in the private keys.  The hex format should work with all other wallets.  I have seen phone wallets that require the hex format be a QR code instead (which can be annoying but not difficult to generate).

I'm using Armory v.93.3 with Bitcoin Core .13.0 (nonsegwit core) and everything works fine right now (it does take some time to sync with the blockchain the first time, or if you haven't synced in a long time).  Your best bet would be to try to get armory working and send all your btc to a new address generated with electrum.

This is not an accurate description of transaction verification.  Blocks do not take hours to create, low-fee transactions might take hours to be included in a block, but blocks are generated every 10 minutes on average.  Verification of transactions is done well before they are included in a block:  Full nodes can verify transactions as they are broadcast, and choose to relay them throughout the network (or not).

This analogy completely breaks down with Bitcoin.  First, Bitcoin is already a "toll-road", it's not free to use blockspace.  Second, if demand for blockspace goes up, great, more adoption.

Anyone know what he is talking about with Bitcoin being Turing complete and "self-evolving code" on the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-07-07 23:09:43
What this discussion really all boils down to is the definition of "prunable".  We have nodes, we have miners, we have full nodes, we have SPVs, we have everyone running different versions of Bitcoin Core code on the network, so everyone is looking at the network (transactions and blocks) through different lenses.  
Depending on which lens you look through, you will see things a little differently from everyone else.  After August 1st, if you are wearing the special glasses, you will be able to see all this extra witness data that is getting propagated with the blocks.  If you are not wearing the special glasses, then all you see are regular 1 MB blocks with a bunch of empty inputs in their transactions, and you will just have to accept those as newly minted coins.  They have no previous UTXO that you can see.  
Correct me if I am wrong in my analogy above, but I think this is accurate.  They can't increase the blocksize directly, so it falls on nodes' responsibility to store the witness data if they want to store the witness data.  I have no doubt that the full complete witness data history will be kept on record by numerous actors in the Bitcoin community, so if you are worried about losing this witness data, I don't think you really have to worry that much.  Nodes upgraded to segwit will store them.  The rest of us won't.

The "0 transaction fee" was always (one of the) false promises of Bitcoin, or at the very least a bait-and-switch.  Check this website for a thorough breakdown of fees:  
At the bottom:  "A transaction was safe to send without fees if these conditions were met:
    It is smaller than 1,000 bytes.
    All outputs are 0.01 BTC or larger.
    Its priority is large enough.  "
This transaction:   is currently testing the 0 transaction fee promise, and will likely not be included in the blockchain for at least a week, if ever.

This was an attempt to pay for goods and services using bitcoin.  It turned into a bit of a mess when my transaction took the network a few hours to confirm.

I think the normal Pay-to-pubkey-hash transaction script will still be valid under most proposals (certainly in BIP ), so in that sense, the answer is no.
Segwit introduces a new type of script called a pay-to-witnessscript-hash which is a type of pay-to-script-hash.  Most people use pay-to-script-hash for multisigs, but witnessscript can be used if the transaction contains many different inputs for a relatively few outputs.  At least, this is my understanding.

Yes, all btc addresses exist already.  In fact, someone made a website that "lists" every single private/public key pair.  It has something like 56 gajillion pages, and of course, no search feature, as it would be impossible to search through the massive, dynamically created database.
The chances of generating a key pair that someone else generated is on the order of picking two atoms at random in the entire universe and having them be the same atom.

Storing data in Bitcoin's blockchain is very expensive.  Just in transaction fees alone, you can roughly get away with 20 satoshis/byte.  This translates to 5 MB of storage in the blockchain for 1 bitcoin.  Transactions themselves are limited to 100 KB, so any files larger than that have to be broken up over multiple transactions, and will most likely land in different blocks.  None of this has stopped people from storing images, mp3s, and other hidden surprises in the blockchain.

Alot of people seem to be confused.  Transaction fees are no longer optional.  Go download any client and try to send bitcoins with a .0000000000000 transaction fee.  It will laugh at you.
Granted, you can still (for the moment) bundle large numbers of transactions together for ONE fee, but a minimum transaction fee was put in months ago.  In fact, remember the 5430 satoshi rule???  
"No Transaction Fees!" is a memory, and is now used to hype the currency to newbs.

"Over the past decade, the US has a fairly low savings rate compared with the rest of the world. Americans save between 11-12% of GDP per year. If we were to apply this savings rate to Bitcoin, already knowing the future path of the Bitcoin money supply, a problem starts to emerge--were 11.5% of Bitcoins saved per year, by 2021, 95.3% of the entire supply of the currency will have been stashed away as savings rendering commerce effectively impossible. "
Did you spot the fallacy there?  The author is comparing 11% of GDP saved per year to 11% of the supply of Bitcoins being saved per year.  They are not comparable.  As the bitcoin economy develops, 11% of GDP would require less and less bitcoins.  People would save the same amount of nominal wealth per year, however, it would take less than 11% of the supply of bitcoins per year to do that.

"Even if blockchain's calculations are off by a factor of 100 or 1000, it's still impossible for Bitcoin to win: "
What if the price of bitcoin increases by a factor of 100?  Or, perhaps new breakthroughs in fusion technology in the future can bring energy costs down substantially.  This is really where the world needs to go if we are going to sustain a population of 10 billion people on the planet anyway.  (think energy flux density).  
"Green energy" is a scam that has been marketed as "trendy" to fools who really think that a growing population's energy needs can be met with terribly inefficient and outdated technologies like solar panels and wind turbines.  There is an energy crisis looming in the future that mankind will have to deal with, and the solution requires a technology that will increase energy output by an order of magnitude of what we are generating today.  Maybe Bitcoin mining will help to motivate the development of a new energy technology.

Thank you so much!  This is my first btc tip!!  I am all smiles tonight, and glad to be on team bitcoin!
I have some other videos I am working on that will explore the real technical aspects of the currency.  I'm starting with a thorough breakdown of SHA-256, digital signatures, wallets, and from there transactions/mining.  
I also want to make some custom bitcoin wallet teeshirts to give as gifts for the holiday season.  I'll post a picture in the future.  
Thanks again!

Resistant to entropy?  I don't think so.  I would argue the exact opposite in fact.  It is much easier for bitcoins to become permanently lost than most people think.  If I die, my bitcoins will become lost forever, unless I specifically pass on my private key data to someone.  It's true that they won't be *destroyed*, but that is not a valid definition of entropy.

I love this part:  " Instead of all this crypto nonsense, one could just cap the number of “valuable” numbers to some fixed number and set a price at which they can be bought. It’s equivalent to paying money for energy needed to “mine” them. "
This statement clearly demonstrates a lack of understanding of the mining process.  The "valuable numbers" that he is referring to in the Bitcoin sense are dependent on the transactions of the network, and can therefore not be computed ahead of time, unless you somehow knew what all future transactions would be.  
He complains that so much energy is wasted and is adding to the air pollution (and probably global warming, why not?).  He does not mention the terrible loss of lives from drone strikes and the perverse NSA spying apparatus which are all funded through Federal Reserve Notes.  Sure, bitcoin can be used to buy drugs; but does it wage war in my name, or spy on me?  I will gladly raise the earth's temperature by 1 satoshi if it means being part of a network that attempts to compete with the monopolistic "government backed" currencies.  
As far as commodities go: good luck trying to send an ounce of gold or a barrel of oil over the internet, anonymously, securably, verifiably, in under 10 minutes, without going through a "trusted" third party.

It is not free for the majority of bitcoin users.  Most wallet clients will not let you send a transaction with a 0 fee anymore.
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:26:35
In my opinion, the mandatory transaction fee is the Achilles' heel of the bitcoin.  It is a subtle weakness that needs to be fixed, reduced to the satoshi level.  
Many people on these threads will say "Oh, but you can just write your own wallet software that broadcasts your transaction with no fee."    
Yea.... that's nice.  For the rest of us, and for new adopters, this is a serious problem, especially as the price moves higher.  
My only hope is that the "Foundation" will reduced these minimum fees as the currency grows in popularity and value.
