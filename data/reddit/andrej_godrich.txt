True, until refund addresses are part of the protocol, I believe BIP70 covers this. Alternatively there is an option to settle with Fiat via the merchant in this scenario although not preferable because then it indeed becomes the problem of the merchant.
Browser plugins can be as difficult to install as for example installing flash. This isn't any different from installing flash via an installer that does all the work for you. Yes the web wallet does need to offer such an installer and some instructions.

Combine this with the original :P

Actually I believe most bitcoin clients have implemented URI handling by now to mitigate having to manually enter details. see [BIP21](
At least BitPay should have this fully implemented considering [this]( issue ticket. I don't know about Coinbase.
Additionally QR codes can also be used to request payment which contains the amount, also supported by most clients.
This is of course not to say that it is impossible to make mistakes, but as long as people are using one of the above methods this seems very unlikely.
I do believe that there is much room on the client side to make things more easier for people who are new to bitcoin, to prevent for instance a timeout when such a user needs to pay but is unable to respond in time. 
I haven't used Coinbase though, but last time I used BitPay I found it pretty much straightforward as a payment gateway.

True and this is where the payment processor should have ways to send the bitcoins back in such a scenario. 
Also theres nothing stopping a web wallet from making a browser plugin that can actually accept bitcoin URI's.
This may not actually be in place right now, but I don't see anything stopping from having that happen in the near future.
Also a good tutorial for beginners could help alleviate these problems. If all else fails, the payment processor should have ways to handle a faulty payment (if not already).

This works like a charm under an ubuntu 14.04.1 vm (hyper-v win8 host). Just upgraded my full node with the compiled executables. :)
Although I'm going to see if I can get the gitian builder working as well in a debian vm. :P

You can scan the QR code displayed on your desktop with your phone. At least BitPay offers a QR code which contains the correct bitcoin amount and address. see: [How to use a QR code](
