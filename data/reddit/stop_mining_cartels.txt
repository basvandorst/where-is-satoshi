Yes. If bitcoin stays at $250.   But they're expecting Bitcoin to increase dramatically over the next few years.

It's not that simple.  VC's raise money in Silicon Valley Funds with a mandate to invest them in startup companies.  They can't speculate with the money directly on Bitcoin, but they can invest in companies in the ecosystem.
That's why All the bitcoin companies combined are a valuation around $5-6 Billion, even though bitcoin itself is only worth $3 Billion.

Yes, they could design the hardware to only pay out to their address.

Why? It's extremely ambitious, which is exactly what one would expect from the people behind it.  And when you have $120 million dollars to to fund it, it seems much less ridiculous.  Go look a their job listings... they're looking for hardware engineers.  And, they used to be called 21E6, and made it known in a few places that they would be engaged in mining somehow

They've obviously done the math and determined this would make more money then just buying Bitcoins.
Mining can be modeled as a call option on the price of Bitcoin. i.e. after manufacturing the hardware and at $0 electricity costs they're paying $100 / coin.  SO, its still better for them to mine then to buy.

Ask that question to every investor in Bitcoin companies.  All the Bitcoin companies combined are worth more then Bitcoin itself.  
My guess?  It's much easier to sell investors on equity in companies then it is to tell them to buy bitcoin directly.

just wait until it's confirmed then, and/or the docs leak

How?  They'll have to lock down the mining chips to point the coinbase reward to their address, or else consumers will just point the chips to their own pools.

They aren't investing $120mm without taking a long-term view.  Once the reward drops to zero, they will be mining transaction fees.
You think Bitcoin only has $1.5Billion left to mine.  They think it will be worth $25,000 per BTC in 5 years, and there will be $150Billion left to mine.
The only thing ridiculous is you pricing future bitcoins at $250.

I'm concerned less about Andreas, and more about 21 Inc.

This might answer your question....
