Oh shoot, brought up the wrong page. Just take the next highest, and that's the case for the next model, so the video says at least.

[Looks like the Verge picked this up!](

Order of posting on YouTube, which looks to be the training site in reverse but with overview first.

I'm a bit late to the party, but if I were to fund an exchange account with BTC, then transfer to USD, would that dollar amount stay on the account for purchases if the exchange rate for BTC were to go down? I'm assuming yes, but I don't want to transfer funds and find out that I'm wrong.

Do you know who the owner of BitcoinTraining is? The videos on the site there are actually out of order, except for the first video, so that when the stuff is explained, it doesn't make sense since the author is referring to previous videos that you wouldn't have seen.

Is anyone else having the site forwarded to bitcoinstore**.vm**?

I mean, it's so complex...  /s

Excellent! Do you happen to know what OS it runs? I have a WiFi router now that runs tomato, which I really love.

My mistake. ^(You all may disregard my comment.)

Maybe you should add some other exchanges to see if you can encapsulate a lot more of the bitcoin traffic.
I personally don't like the Mt. Gox integration because of the lag in their API. It sounds cool, but a lot of the bubbles come in the waves meaning there are empty spaces where those transactions would be.

[They've updated their site with the new information, as far as I can tell.](
Looks like they've raised the price since I last looked, as well as changed the name to something more generic.

[Here's the code on Pastebin]( for the curious.
I started learning Python a few days ago, so I apologize for those who are fluent. I'm much better in Java, so this is quite the change over for me.
Problems with the code:
* No error handling (ex: CampBX went down for maintenance an hour or so ago, throwing an error and ending the program)
* Many variables dependent on my own screen (centered for 180 characters)
* Only works on Python 2.7
* Lame way of clearing the screen
I'm sure this little project will keep me busy for a while. Python is an interesting language, to say the least. I already like it a bit more than Java (somethings are so much easier, like strings to float, getting data from a server, JSON is worlds easier than gson ever is in Java)
Sorry if this isn't as related to Bitcoin as the other posts on this subreddit, but I figured I'd share nevertheless.

Just to warn you, it looks like this can only be powered with PoE, so if you don't have that, it won't work. Hopefully the seller can jump in with some info, as I'd like one so long as I can power it via traditional means.
EDIT: The manual the seller posted talks about a power adapter. Does anyone know if this is included with this particular item (as in this store's)?
