@_date: 2018-12-03 17:52:45

As we have a lot family strengthening programms in eastern europe as well its quite possible that we already support some children in those minority groups. I can ask tomorrow if thats already happening in the eastern europe organizations!

Thank you for your honest feedback. For ads sometimes those kind of pictures work better then pictures from the country itself. Often we don't even have rights to portrait children or we need to safe their privacy. Plus we have a lot of material on our campaign page from Uganda: Photos and a video about the problem.
I'll try to talk to our graphic department. I'll try to get something better fitting!

Hey! We help children in 135 countries. For this campaign we chose girls in Uganda because we just recently visited this country and saw an urgent need.

We can't be more grateful. Thx again to the whole moderation team!

Hey! Thank you so much. With crypto currency and blockchain in general we could help children in need with very simple measures. As you can imagine money is getting lost in currency changing. For example from € to usd to a 3rd local currency. Imagine everybody would accept the same currency (without transfer costs) and transferable within minutes.  But unfortunately we are not there YET. I cross my fingers for a global acceptance!

Hi reddit!
\*Backstory:\*Since 3 years I work for SOS Children’s Villages, an NGO that helps children in need with loving homes in 135 countries. I convinced my organization to accept cryptocurrency donations this year and we already have ideas to use blockchain driven technology to help more children in the future.
**With your help** we want to give girls in Uganda a better chance in life. At the moment SOS Children’s Villages is helping 2.473 girls in Uganda with school education. But the need is much bigger. **Young girls are often excluded from school education.** Families don't have enough money and in case of doubt boys are allowed to go to school.
Help us to enable school education for more girls. **1 Bitcoin enables 50 girls to attend a school for a whole year.** Your donation finances school fees, books, school uniforms etc.
Thanks to our cooperation partner Bitpanda (one of Europe’s biggest exchanges) we can exchange bitcoins back into € quickly and without any additional fees. **And until Dec 31st Bitpanda matches all crypto donations up to a total amount of 1 BTC.**
If you want to make a donation or if you have more questions visit our website: [ I am also going to answer all questions about this project in this topic. To legitimate ourselves I have sent reddit moderators official documents, as we know there is a lot of fraud going, even when it comes to help children in need. We are not allowed to hold any donations for a longer time. Speculation with donated money is wrong and also against the law in our country (Austria). So we are changing donations back into € frequently.
* We, SOS Children’s Villages, are helping girls in Uganda to go to school
* All donations are getting doubled until Dec. 31st up to 1 BTC by Bitpanda
