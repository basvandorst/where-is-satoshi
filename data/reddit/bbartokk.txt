If that is true I would not be amazed. Think about it this way. There is a huge store in your neighborhood. They have empty shelves and you say "I'm a small retailer. I cant afford a space this big, I cant afford the marketing required to promote my shop, I cant afford anything that would allow me to compete at your level. Can I put my items for sale on your empty shelves?" 
They say...sure! You put your items up for sale, this is what we take as a cut. If I owned that big shop and saw all your stuff selling well then I would buy those items too. 
If you want to compete and not get ripped off then start your own eCommerce site that provides good service and good products at competitive prices. Dont be surprised that using another companies infrastructure is a "rip off".
