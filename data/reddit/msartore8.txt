Guy is probably some fictitious character.  A front for some gov agency..
Just like wizard of oz...
Or I've amused myself with the scenario that Stephen Hawking is actually a vegetable, and the powers that be just drip their scheduled secretes of the universe through his little talky-machine.. ��

If you hardened (military grade lead enclosure) your coins and paper wallets, then survived the days of darkness and prolonged "winter"...
Then years later when everything is back to normal... Retrieve them...I'm sure they'd be worth something.

They're just trying to drive the price down temporarily then SCOOP mass quantities, then hype it up again. Pump n dump on the highest strata. 
Essentially, Whales "breaching" as opposed to "beaching"...
There's too much actual physical hardware across the globe dedicated to that specific coin right now for full on failure imo.
Blah blah blah...
