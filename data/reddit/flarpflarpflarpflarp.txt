I guess it sort of depends on what you'd consider investment, and the timeframe.  I built a couple websites that were generating passive income.  Cost me about $1000 total and some time setting them up, but I made about $40k off of them over a few years before they died off (i.e. Google didn't like my websites anymore).   And I also spent time in Northern California a few years ago and participated in the Green rush.  Did well, but that's about all I'll say, ha.

Ha, value was kinda questionable, basically they were curated lists of auctions on eBay.  Relisting items, but for specific niches like guitars.  One site was a collection of vintage guitars people were watching/bidding on, without all those stupid $1 guitars.  I called it a crap filter for eBay, but since it was just relisting eBay items, eventually Google started hitting me w duplicate content penalties.  I just let them die off naturally and didn't keep pushing it.

I don't dislike Canada or really Canadians, per se.  There's  just a condescending attitude of  talking shit from the bleachers I get from many Canadians.  So many Canadians come down to the states and complain  about the US, move to the US and spend a time bitching about how it's not Canada, yet for some reason won't go back to Canada.  I honestly can't express how many times I hear this, especially in a warm, southern University town.   Dont move to someone's neighborhood and start complaining aboot it.    (Or even like OP, who moved a large amount if money,is ignorantly and is blaming America for Anti-money laundering regulations.  Its idiotic)  I've had my eye on BC for a long time, but other places are higher on my list.  It's as easy for me to get to Europe as it is there.  Norway is easier.

You clearly reinforce my shitty opinion of Canadians as baselessly condescending.  Oooh, you've been places.  Neat, me too.  I've lived in S. Africa, Korea, spent a few months in Europe.  Small trips to S. America, too.  You'll probably just condescendingly roll your eyes and think I'm lying, but Canadians and Germans seem to be the worst about going somewhere else and bitching about it.  I've been a lot of places and met a lot of people of many different backgrounds.  
For what it's worth, I haven't once said USA is better than anywhere.  I'm saying it is part of Canadian culture to blame America and bitch about it while they visit.  When abroad, that's how you can tell the difference between the Americans pretending to be Canadian so they don't get kidnapped and the actual Canadians.

Sorry, but I don't think these are unfair points.  Bitcoin is bad for large scale transactions bc you can lose 10% in the 10min.  Thats a lot if you're talking $100000 or more.
Lose your private keys for a wallet yet?
We know this, it may not be bad, but yes people pay for illegal things w Cryptos.
Everyone complaining about BTC fees is evidence here.  I use LTC, I HODL BTC and don't transact in it bc there's a better solution.
They think it could be a bubble, but Yeah, govts are just starting to pay attention.  Be prepared for that or you're foolish.  It's going to happen, especially if BTC gets bigger.  Can't tell if that will be good or bad.
These countries are invested in cryptocurrencies, they will be affected different than the US.
If it gets to 60k (over. 1 trillion market cap) that's when they think government will pay attention.
These are all pretty valid points, and decent things to consider.  Doesn't call it a failure or claim BTC is the next Jesus. I'm more surprised by how reasonable these are.

@_date: 2017-10-24 16:53:56
You're twisting the original statement and missing the distinction between creating value and adding value.  Bitcoin doesn't use math to CREATE value.  The math BTC uses to verify the validity of a transaction ADDS to the value.  A lock on a door doesn't create the value of the door.  A hole in a wall that needs to be blocked is why the door has value.  (A record in the transaction log is why BTC has value.)  The lock and key that open the door do not create the value of the door as they do not solve the problem of the hole in the wall that needs to be opened and closed.  They only ADD to the value of the door.  You can improve the lock and key and have a more valuable door, but a door that has no lock and key can still cover a hole in a wall (a transaction record that doesn't use math can still be used to record transactions, the may just validates them).  Math doesn't 'create' the value.  
Remember, the CFTC classified BTC as a commodity, not me.  So, you're arguing against them.  No one said math didn't add to the value.  The mythical 'math' that btc uses has been used in server encryption for years, but people cant easily trade servers so tell me how the math creates the value of it.  It's confusing b/c BTC has features that make it very useful as a currency (seashells are a more useful currency than raw meat), but the value was created by the transaction record and what people are willing to pay for it.  Math only ADDS to the amount they are willing to exchange for it.   You don't 'solve math problems for money', if you think that you're either over simplifying it or misunderstanding it.

Bc you've already missed the fast rise.  We're only going to see slower growth from now.  The early adpoters already adopted and the transition to mainstream will be slower that all this hype is making it look.  Sell some of your stock and get into crypto, but just bc there's crypto, doesn't mean the rest of the financial system will disappear.  They're too entrenched and will regulate their existence.  Learn about alt coins and out some there, but selling everything lacks the fundamental of investment... diversification.  You should have done that years ago, now you're just buying at a high point.

Think of it like writing in a book. You don't need math to write the transaction record.  The math proves that what was written is valid and accurate.  Math isn't the record, its the handshake that all parties use to agree. Math helps for accounting total sums, but the value is still the record, not the math.
One thing to remember is that not all coins use math to solve the agreement (consensus).  Some use voters to say the transaction is valid, instead of math problems.

It comes to an existential/semantic  debate on when it becomes money though.  It becomes money once you start trading it.  It is still just a transaction record until outside forces attach value and are willing to offer something in exchange for it.  I don't see the transaction record as having intrinsic value until you can add some external exchange value to it.  The transaction(mining) doesn't take an item and make it more usable, like refining ore.  You can keep all the little pieces of gold for making gold bricks you want, but unless someone will trade other money for it, there's no value.  The us gov still counts btc as a commodity for this reason.  The immutability of the record is why people can use it as money, but it isn't really money.  Like, you wouldn't consider a cow money even though it can produce more cows.  Baby cows are the reward in that system, but cows aren't money, but can be traded for money.  
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:54:50
Sweet crap, people don't understand Bitcoin.  You don't get money for solving a math problem, you get a record in a transaction log for processing a transaction.  The math is just how it's validated. Mining and cryptography are still complicated concepts to most people.

@_date: 2017-10-23 17:41:33
Agreed, just using the term mining confuses people.  It makes sense in the context of how individuals are rewarded, I guess, but it makes less sense nowadays that most people are part of pools to even out the rewards.  Cryptography just sounds like ghosts or something scary, so I think that shuts people's brains down, but it's nothing new to the nerds that have to keep servers secure.  Most of the population doesn't need to know how they work.  They just need to feel comfortable with new words and that someone out there understands what's happening under it all.

That's a silly question people keep bringing up and shows how little they understand about mining or finance or running a business.  Why would anyone sell an interest in their business if they could keep it all for themselves?  People sell interests in businesses all the time for all kinds of reasons (like needing to buy more equipment so they can increase capacity).  Mining contracts are pretty much an annuity.  People sell annuities all the time.   It's not a new concept to invest a lump sum to get small increments returned.  Have you ever heard of a loan?  Why would anyone take out a loan for equipment and use the profitability of that to pay back investors? Oh maybe b/c they get a better deal if they buy a ton of equipment at once than if they just buy a little. 
Can you mathematically show me how it's not profitable?  I can show you that AND the situations where the math makes sense.   Just b/c you don't get the math, doesn't make it a scam.

You're right in that if you took Dollars and bought straight coins vs putting Dollars into a contract immediately, it's not the best move.  BTC will likely continue to rise in value, and the current fee payout (in btc) won't be as valuable (in Dollars) as if you just bought and held (probably).  But some of us are leveraging BTC's appreciation and buying contracts with that increase (profits). If you're just buying coins now, you're late to the game, thanks for increasing my value in dollars to the point that I could afford to buy a lot of computing power.  But I'm looking for things that will take btc and return in btc without additional capital injections, so the price of the dollar and the exchange rate will have little effect on me.  (Bonus: being that they take a fixed fee in $'s, I'm super happy if the value of btc goes up meaning they take a smaller % of my btc as the value increases). 
  
Comparing these strategies for me:
Buying hopes that 1btc bought for $2500 goes up to $3000 in a year ($500 profit).  
In my situation the 1btc I got years ago and traded for cheap computing power that will generate 1.2btc or more in the next year.  $3600 value ($600 profit or more) and I'll be able to take that profit and invest it into other things that earn btc.  I'm not playing the exchange rate game, it's WAY too volatile.  
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:13:39
Not that you'll actually read this, but...
That doesn't have much bearing on calculating profitability/ROI since the period increases are what will be used to calculate from the current difficulty going forward (use the mining calc on the site you sent me and you'll see how to account for difficulty).  You need to know the average period increase, not that it has gone up a lot to use in calculations.   All you're saying is that there are diminishing returns.  Duh, but how much? Do some math and you'll know.  
If the difficulty increases according to the historic trend and the value of btc increases then this is a better investment than holding.  If the difficulty goes crazy and accelerates its average increase (10%+ on average) through people bringing tons of computing power online while there's no increase in transaction volume, then mining (and contracts) isn't profitable for me or anyone.  But that doesn't seem likely since if difficulty drastically increases over time, people will retarget their power to more profitable coins.  It's a balancing algorithm that is meant to be stable so there aren't drastic swings in computing power. Happy to report back though.  So far my payouts are a small percentage more than suggested by the calculators.   
In many situations I know more than most people in the room.  Not always for sure, but there's no way to quantify that without sounding super douchey.  I spend the time to learn how things work and my best skill learning.  This is by no means the first profitability or business decision I have calculated, though.  Just a new medium which I'm spending a lot of time to understand.

Yeah, I mean, let me be clear that I just recently got a contract and am waiting to see profitability and if they will fulfil their contract.  I did a bit of research, but was limited in actual information on these types of investments.  I haven't been able to find much more than people yelling back and forth if it's a scam or not.  There's not much useful info either way.     
I was looking to reinvest btc profits into something that will earn btc whether it be physical or cloud.  Bitcoinwisdom seems to be the best site to calculate returns on both since they factor in an increase in difficulty.   The important part is that you have to buy contracts of a minimum size to see profitability otherwise the difficulty increase will eat up your returns before you have recouped your investment.  Most calculators do not factor in the difficult so you don't see how quickly your daily returns will diminish (assuming a steady increase of difficulty).  There's a reason large companies are getting into the mining space, and it's the economy of scale.  It's not as profitable as a small company.  It is less profitable, if at all for most of the low hashpower contracts.  Some of them WILL NOT break even and have no way to breakeven.  However, at a certain size they do become profitable (same with physical mining).  But then it's the question of how profitable.  This is where I think people are getting scammed is that they see the calculators say they will get a return of 150% on a small contract.  They think that's great, but they failed to account for difficulty rise and transaction fees eating into that.  So while your contract can return 150%, you need a contract that is going to return 200% to cover the fees and the diminishing returns.  If you're being safe on a small contract, you can't possibly outlast difficulty increase b/c you cant buy enough hp.  More companies are coming online to handle it and it will be come more competitive.   You have to invest enough to see the return.  It's the same with rig mining, a $300 computer generating XMH/s will get you nowhere in the mining space now.  You need XXMH/s min and a few cards now to see a profit.    
For one contract I have, it looked something like a 240% return when I bought it.  Do I think this is the actual return I will get?  No, but I've calculated the return (with a consistent difficulty increase towards the higher end of the historical trend), subtracted the various fees, and it looks like I'll be closer to the 170% over the life of the contract.  But my minimum threshold for return that I will be happy with is 'only' 20%, since that beats most markets.  The other thing I did was take the estimated payments and plugged them into an annuity calculator to understand the net present value.  The initial cost of the contract was significantly less than the net present value of an annuity with a similar payout structure.  So I pulled the trigger, and in my short experience the daily payouts have been higher than I was calculating to see a positive return, not drastically, but a solid few %.  Good sign it will fight off the looming difficulty increases.
Edit: Sorry for the text wall, kind of a tangent
