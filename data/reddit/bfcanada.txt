There was the option to vote as many times as you like. Only the last vote cast counted.

Francis Pouliot here - 
I tried this in Montreal Canada, and it works. I was surprised to see how easy it was. This will be very useful information for the many people that are trying to live only off of Bitcoin.
When on your phone, you can just click the button to add funds to your barcode "virtual giftcard" balance. This prompts an adress which you send bitcoins to via your mobile wallet. The balance is on the virtual giftcard for 60 minutes, after which any remaining change (or all the balance if unused) should be sent to you via an email.
The Starbucks clercks have barcode scanners. Just scan it like any other giftcard. I've heard from some people that sometimes the scanner doesn't work, but it definitly worked for me.
I should add that I sent 4$ worth of bitcoins and got 5$ worth of balance. 
Warning: **do not put a fake email adress when prompted by Coinbase**. The change is sent to you via email. a has 7$ worth of my BTC.

Really awesome! 
So good to see Canadian exchanges competing for customers by doubling-down on better and more diverse service offerings.
If Canadian Bitcoin business keep up their good work, Canada will soon become a model for best Bitcoin business practices

This is false. There is no new law regulating Bitcoin as money, only a provision in Canada's budget implementation act that includes "businesses that deal in virtual currencies" under the current Anti Money-Laudering law.
What are businesses that deal in virtual currencies? That is still to be determined through regulation.
There is a lot of misinformation coming out lately, be careful about which news source you trust. 
For the reality:

Hello ThePiachu!

Great initiative to get Jason via Google hangout

What happened to the forum?

This researcher seems to get it, we can almost tell he admires how Bitcoin works.

We reached out to producers and the director to arrange screenings across Canada (we were going to organize the screenings for them non-profit) and they were not interested.
It's a shame, documentary looks awesome.

Hello Emily and Tony,
My only question: is this available for merchants located outside of the United States? 
Thanks and keep up your excellent work!

This is the kind of events that the community should foster and sponsor more. Great initiative!

This is really great. I've just tried it and so far it works very well.
Good features:
1) Rush wallet is easier to set-up than blockchain.info 
2) You can export your keys
3) The goal progress meter is really cool
4) You can withdraw from your fundraiser to your main wallet in one click (sweep) and without affecting the progress meter
From no Bitcoin wallet to having your fundraiser set-up in less than 5 minutes
