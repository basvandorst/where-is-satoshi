I Didn't steal anything he sold it to me I looked through the hard drive and found it asked him if he wanted it back he said he knew nothing about bitcoin said it was mine so therefore your argument is invalid.

Will do

I Guess the reasonable thing to do is contact the seller again and arrange to give them half of the Money since they did sell the laptop but the seller in the description said as is no refunds or returns. So I don't know what to do IDGAF
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:12:04
or I can do as I wish

I fucking struck gold. Once in a life time opportunity never will something like this happen to me again. payed 100 dollars for a laptop containing 2.7 million USD
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:49:22
I just looked and the rate for the amount i have is somewhere around 2.7 million dollars. I think I just shit my pants.

the father replied to me and said he did not know what I was talking about so he said I sold you the laptop and the harddrive was included in the purchase so whatever you found it is yours to keep
@_date: 2014-01-24 19:00:53
I will keep all who are interested informed as to what I decide to do

I have contacted the seller of this laptop he has replied stating that he has no idea what bitcoin is this was his son's laptop as he is in the military and deployed his son told his dad to scrap the laptop. Guess he forgot it had bitcoin on it
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:51:51
he did not  know what bitcoin was
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:57:39
I am literally shaking right now no fucking clue what I am supposed to do morally I would give them half then give 500,000 to some charitable cause and keep the rest because I am 21 single may get married and have kids down the road need money for life so yea.
