Insurance will still be just as inefficient. Most of the value isn't lost in getting the money from and to people, it's in correctly figuring out how much money to send to whom and when.

I think you're grossly underestimating the amount of work that goes into insurance. I know several people who are candidates for a degree in actuarial sciences. Their whole career will be spent predicting the finances of insurance companies. Although it might seem that way at first, it's not a problem you can just "throw a few engineers at".

A partial fix for this would be if companies selling in BTC used futures contracts to fix the USD/BTC exchange rate. icbit.se can help with that.

I challenge you.
If you post your BTC address, I'll send you 50 cents worth. Try and double spend it. Try and make a wallet say there's money in it, and then have it revert after the first confirmation.
It's harder than you'd think. Most attacks against bitcoin are probabilistic in nature, and you can only say "this will probably work most of the time" with even the best 51% attacks. No-confirmation attacks are extremely hard to pull off, and impossible to do reliably. There's no way in hell people would risk doing it on a regular basis.

The point is you don't need to wait for the first official confirmation. For the price of a coffee, an unconfirmed confirmation is fine. This is the same principle VISA and Starbucks use. They don't wait for official confirmation, and I don't believe Starbucks even keeps receipts. They just eat the cost of fraud, because it's smaller than actually tracking it down. Also, fraudsters generally don't care about stealing a single cup of coffee.
Naturally, you'd wait for the confirmation on bigger purchases. This might become a problem at bigger stores (i.e. Home Depot or Best Buy). In these cases, you'll have to make people wait 10 minutes. A solution to that is to just amuse people for 10 minutes on checkout, or let people buy without an official "check-out procedure".
I don't really know. Bitcoin might just be a failed experiment listed in economics textbooks of the future. But until then, it'll be a fun (and enlightening!) ride.

They are betting that the price of bitcoin will regress, and will make a quick buck when it falls.
That, or scam.

Free market.
I, for one, welcome this kind of behavior. If it becomes common, the inefficiency will be eliminated by other free market participants picking up the free money.
Whoever is doing this is trying to manipulate people psychologically. That's fine. Lots of people can create programs which can't be manipulated by such schemes, and will just eat the profits from any attempts. Horray!
Regulation bad. Free markets good. This is bitcoin, practically the most libertarian movement around.
