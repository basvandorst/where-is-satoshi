your mad because they're calling you stupid... 
you can't figure that out? 
not to your face obviously but this general chatter of them going "man who would be this dumb" is getting to you because you're one of those people who is that dumb.

so is crypto. there is a set amount of it. 


but why were they handing each other shiny rocks like it mattered before they even knew what electricity was? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:52:11
because its backed by the central banking system and people have faith in it. 
if it ever collapsed and people got scared they would be dumping cash as fast as they could and trying to pick up any other kind of currency (unlikely given the global economy's hard on for the american dollar) 
paper money also has no intrinsic value and I never said it did.

... what intrinsic value does gold have? 
its shiny? 
people still uprooted their lives to go try to pull it out of the ground just cause they could sell it to other people. 
just because there isn't intrinsic value doesn't mean there isn't value in a decentralized currency.

it doesn't. that would be a bunch of shitty selfish people competing for who can give the most away. 
that's not good.

why do you need validation from other people to do a good deed? 
I think that's the bigger issue here.

lol. its the other way around pal. it went up too fast and the market corrects. it oscillates. always. anyone who rode it up to 20k and didn't think it was going to drop almost as quickly would be an idiot.

... people who go around asking for head pats for donating money give me the heeby jeebies. 
like why does he have to tell all of us he's donating? just give them the money and shut up about it.

... what? 
I'm saying there was no bank robbery... the bankers made off with the cash(coins) and said they got robbed(hacked) 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:30:21
lmao they didn't get "hacked" they stole your coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:58:42


no its not. its worth 100 dollars. because while it might be small amounts individually... it is cash... that can be used as currency... in the real world...

some people are just awful at keeping secrets

honestly what I find just absolutely astounding, statistically speaking of course, is how many people seem to make exactly as much money as they need and live paycheck to paycheck. 
isn't that odd? you'd think either people would not have enough or be saving something. but somehow people sort of seem to manage to get by for the most part on exactly what they make. 
but they don't do it on purpose of course... its just a huge coincidence. 
funny thing though, if you give them a raise they don't seem to put any money away. they just start spending that whole paycheck instead. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:08:29
ok. 
thanks for saying that. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:13:29
... yeah a soceity of selfish jagoffs seeking validation from each other sounds wonderful. 
oh wait. no it doesn't.
