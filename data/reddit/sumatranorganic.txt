Alts have been behaving in tandem. On a given high volatility day 98% of alts on Poloniex are either green or red. Over the last few months investing in any 8 of the top 100 altcoins would perform very similarly to investing in 80 top 100 altcoins. 


Margin trading, it's quite possible he was shorting ETH on Poloniex.

Isn't it far more incriminating that your physical home address is involved? I've never understood that, even with perfect payment anonymity you've still got a big box of drugs with your name on it. Doesn't law enforcement scan packages or use dogs or something?

To us the identification is only made because 'A said so', to the government it can be from the service you used to buy the coins, I.P. address, phone info etc. If you look into the Ross Ulbricht case they connected the dots by obtaining I.P. and e-mail information from every obscure site he had used over the previous several years. I guess if you're extremely careful there are ways to avoid making those dots connectable though. 
Of course, you have to commit a crime that justifies them digging that deep, such as a massive theft or selling drugs.

It has a market cap of $34,500 and has 3 trading-pairs on two exchanges. Seems to be working out very well for the currency of a crypto podcast.

Ya, that sounds like a snoopy wife. I share a bank account with mine so she'd notice an odd cam-site payment, but she's never even asked for the password to use my laptop, much less investigated my crypto activity.
