True enough. I should be asking something along the lines of how many GH/s I should be aiming for to provide a decent amount of BTC/m

My knees are in extraordinary pain, as to the likes Ive never felt before, they've been getting progressively worse but not this quickly, and it makes me wonder what the future holds in my ability to walk, so Id like to have my bases covered in case of the worst.

Thank you very much. Good info in there.

What does the average rig put out these days in GH/s?
@_date: 2013-11-08 07:30:33
I was thinking of ordering a couple of those 600GH/s but Ive been talked out of that. But 30GH/s doesn't sound like much honestly. at the current difficulty what do you estimate the BTC output at approx 30GH/s over the period of a month?

You raise a very valid point, good sir/madam.  What would you consider the best bang for the buck? Just if I want to spend a portion of the earnings on mining equipment?
