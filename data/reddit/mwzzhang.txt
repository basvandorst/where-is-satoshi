While on the other hand, people may see it as spam. Also some people find it annoying, and some people find the proselytism distasteful (like people seeing on or other subs).
And some people don't like other people putting a price (by extension, worth) on their comments (implying that their comment is practically worthless).

exactly, Weimar Germany was not socialist, Zimbabwe is not socialist.
I have already found examples where countries which are NOT socialism yet still suffers hyperinflation.
Meaning your hypothesis is not valid.
Also there were socialist government that spends within their mean, the province of Saskatchewan during the '50s was a classic case of that. Guess what that province had at that time that rest of the provinces don't? Public health insurance, public auto insurance, balanced budget.

Not to be a stickler, but the background doesn't look quite right.
Given many phone on the foreground have fairly subdued screen.
If those are actually the flashlight of the smartphones, that would explain it somewhat. But it still doesn't explain why so many phone in the foreground did not have the flashlight faces the camera. Also I don't think a phone's flashlight is THAT strong (some of them looks like it came from 100m+ away).
Don't get me wrong, I fully support HK democracy (China could use it as proving ground for gradual democratic transition elsewhere, they have to face the music at some point). But the picture raised some red flags for me...

But what is gold? Can gold be eaten? Can gold be used to build buildings? No. Gold is just another precious metal with an value assigned to it based on its scarcity. The gold dollar was arguably harder to manipulate. But that's about it.
IIRC back in the old days China functioned with chunks of silver as its currency. Now think of the same thing but with gold, then think of the old gold dollar certificate. There was functionally no difference.

Ever heard of 'too big to fail'. Yeah, printing currency isn't exactly the problem here.
You see, the market assumes that there are ENOUGH competitions so there is no monopoly nor could they collude and corner the market. You know damn well that is not the case.
You are not living in a free market. Free market doesn't exist in the real world. Get over it.
Because people are known to pull up the ladder behind them to reduce competition. But that also means there is no equality of opportunity.
Before you say libertarianism4lfye, I suggest you take a look at EVE online, DayZ, and other MMO games that have player-driven society to see how that would break down quite quickly.

No, China is not unbanning anything.
I am not an economist. but here is my 5 GRD's (roughly 0.02 CAD, 0.03264mBTC at the time of this post) worth:
Bitcoin is by design deflationary, and government-issued currency like USD are by design inflationary. So you have two system going the opposite way. That contributes the apparent appreciation in value of BTC against, say, USD.
Do keep in mind that BTC is backed by absolutely nothing other than the full faith and credit people places on it, government-issued currency is backed by the ability of the said government to levy taxes. Both are pretty arbitrary. Especially when the government's ability to levy taxes is called into question. That is why you don't see investors flocking to buy Zimbabwean dollars.
While the China-Russia energy deal does put into question the future dominance of USD, I personally don't think that affected the value of BTC by much. My understanding is that the reason for using local currency for the deal is because currency conversion is a major pain in the ass. Before, one party, say, China, has to go to the world market (probably US exchange), buy certain amount of USD, and use said USD to buy stuff with Russia. And the other party, in this case Russia, has to do the same thing in reverse -- i.e. receive USD, go to market and attempt to purchase RUB w/ said USD. Now, they can just trade w/o going to the world market, saving tons of labour.
That being said, don't expect the value of BTC to grow forever. As supply for new BTC dries up, people WILL start to horde it. With the usefulness of BTC as functional currency goes down understandably, the price will drop. Causing people to sell in order to recover their 'investment', causing the currency to be liquid once again. Thus complete the cycle. This applies to all other non-perishable commodity. The only difference is that BTC (and really any other cryptocurrency) is not centralized (only backed by the arbitrary faith people placed on it), so no one could effectively manipulate the currency effectively. Thus the cycle of boom-and-bust will not be affected by 'stimulus program'.

It's easy to say not to spend money one doesn't have. However, there are cases when you just don't have money. So it's either that or go live outside and be forever jobless.

Fractional reserve bank by itself isn't problematic (full reserve banking hasn't worked out so well...), it is problematic when fuckers gets greedy and set the reserve ratio at a ludicrously low rate, exposing themselves to more risk of market volatility.
Keep in mind the while fractional reserve banking sounds terrifying, fiat money is also just a number on a piece of paper. You trust it because someone with a fair bit of trustworthiness tells you it is worth that much. So there really isn't any difference.
It's all a game of trust.

Yes, like eating rotten vegetable. Have cardboard home.
But seriously, EI payment is awful and barely enough to cover living expenses.
Again, steady income = 0 in this case. So whatever measurement to lower living cost will not last forever. Saving will eventually run to zero thanks to the aforementioned zero steady income.

That's a disincentive.
You spent x amount of wealth to invest in bitcoin, you will want it back asap. Intermittent power supply means that **YOU** are not getting your money back.
Now for all I care, you could be made of money. But with investment mindset like that, I doubt you will be successful in the long-term.
