I consider bitcoins a high-risk, high potential return investment. These kind of investments should be diversified. Some are going to bust and others are going to boom. Anyone who is confident about what is going to happen w/ bitcoins is fooling themselves.

Currently, at least for US to Mexico remittance, most people use Moneygram- or Western Union-type services. I think the process of obtaining, sending, and redeeming bitcoins is rather involved for most people. I think the most likely development for bitcoin remittances is that there would be a company which, from a user interface perspective functions like a better or cheaper Western Union. You just go into the store and say that you want to send $1000 to X address, the guy behind the counter punches the info into the computer, and an hour later the transfer is complete. Actually what happened was that that the BitRemittance company deposited $1000 worth of bitcoins in X address and then caused those to be sold for pesos (or whatever designated currency) which can be picked up on at the specified location by showing the specified ID. But then why go through the bitcoin step? Why not just use your own software to let the foreign terminal know how much money can be redeemed.

I dont have a great solution, but the fact is that this is a major impediment to the bitcoin economy.

do you have a name or link for this site?

plausible, but dont over-convince yourself. we dont know what is going to happen. you should keep your eyes open and remember that bitcoin is a risk you are taking.

unlike bitcoin, silkroad has some notable weaknesses (no sort by price, search function is weak and limited). I definitely see room for a competitor in that market. I do wonder why they chose to go with litecoin. Maybe the proprietors are holding litecoin and want to drive up the price. Maybe they just want to be different.

Does it seem that the fork was produced intentionally by a miner intending to exploit, or was this an entirely unintended development resulting purely from the different gearing of 0.7 and 0.8?

I agree. If bitcoins continue to be primarily an investment, then that is just unsustainable speculation. But we have to be realistic about where we are. At this point, telling people not to worry about the underpinnings is not productive. There is not enough infrastructure in place.

except that if people are going to make an investment (which a purchase of bitcoins mostly is, at this point) they will want to understand some of the fundamentals so they can evaluate how good an investment it is. Sure, once there are tons of businesses accepting them and they are easier to use than other kinds of money, at that point there will be no need for most users to understand the underpinings, but thats not where we are yet.

Right, and it needs to be easier to buy bitcoins! I dont see a lot of migrant workers going through the MtGox verification process.
