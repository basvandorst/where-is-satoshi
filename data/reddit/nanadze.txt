Sorry, totally disagree. Bitcoin for miners? In this conditions and if it will stay in future it means bitcoin for Bitmain, centralization etc...
Poor miners mine empty blocks, earn bitcoins and trying to influence on bitcoin future development just with one purpose - more coins.
Users like you, I and all others are hostages of miners, we cannot influence in any matter. I care about future of bitcoin and want to be heard. 
UASF is fair to all. Miners have coins (if they do not like, no problem, there are lot of coins, go ahead), users are sure that nobody will influence on future development.

At the beginning for such sub you'll need few moderators which will be moderating and looking for interesting and useful info. Browsing sites, blogs, twitters, other subs...
