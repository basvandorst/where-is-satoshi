Good man :) let me know how you are doing in 3 months :)

Now is the time dude: do this, take 10 percent of whatever you make, pick up off the ground, or get for free and buy Bitcoin with it. No one misses 10 percent - I should know I did that even when I was so broke I couldn't buy cigarettes. And I lived in the bad part of NY at the time. Still saved. With Bitcoin you end up with more than your principle in a few months. By 6 months you can liquidate part of your monthly Gains and actually buy things - with some discipline and time according to your income (freelancing is way better than getting a minimum wage job) you will be able to do well. Just obey money law numero uno: never touch the principle amount you have put it, and never withdraw 100% of your gains.

Haha - yeah, but the plus is that you can work long hours without getting a headache and you don't have to do everything twice in regards to mixing.

It's what I do - but I don't have paychecks because I started my own business, so instead when I get paid by a client I take 10% of each payment and buy Bitcoin with it. As my business gets more successful I turn larger percentages (of increasingly larger revenue) into Bitcoin. It's comfortable and makes it really easy to grow your Bitcoin

These are pretty good - but I am not going to send anything for mastering until it has been thoroughly checked on the Genelecs. I do have to say I prefer them to other open back headphones - these are designed to be reference headphones while a lot of other open back headphones were incidentally used for mixing - buyer beware though, these are super quiet and require a soundcard or a USB DAC to really shine.

Audio engineering on the go :) heading to Goa for two months and don't want to lug around Genelecs. 
I might be able rig up a Max for live device to make the Bitcoin chart make some noise :)
