This bankster pretends to ignore what's Bitcoin but this fucking Wall St criminal knew Bitcoin since like 4 years ago according to personal accounts of him. He knows exactly why is dangerous for his fiat cartel and he's now hoping that the futures market or other cryptos attack BTC market.

Bitcoiners don't need only a nice UI site but one that actually delivers. If it's not professionally oriented for traders and good for all BTC ecosystem then it's shit. It's time they deliver on fixing their high fees shit and work on segwit or BCH.  Right now they are playing duck.

He doesn't understand shit about technology so he stays away from it. So his opinion on BTC is worth crap to me.

The *feeling* of joining it is absolutely related. :-)
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:59:30
Adopting users is one thing. Delivering on them is way more important. Now we are stuck with a bunch of newbies holding btc afraid of high fees and about to dump btc given the uncertainties created by Coinbase itself.

Well, I actually do find a big problem after trying to use a Wagecan card:
"Due to high demand top-ups, it takes 2-7 business days for your top-up request."
Really??? so much for living in a blockchain world and it takes up to 7 days for my card to get loaded after having already sent you my Bitcoin??
I think you guys need to create your own banks as well if this is going to be the norm on a regular basis...
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:35:52
Of course they do have to do with high fees.  Heard of Segwit? They are not using it.

HODL strong my fellow bitcoiners and remember this: 
Wallstreet will be simply trading with an index that attempts to mimic Bitcoin and settles with inflationary cash. Only do we hold true BTC so let them spit upwards in their parallel fake market made of petty fiat.
BTC is still significantly undervalued from a currency and store of value standpoint so don't let them shake it off your hands.
[HODL!](

Not necessarily. If the tail is much bigger in terms of trading volume than the dog, the latter can freak out and mimic the tail move.

We should probably put this up in change.org and highlight that the actual financial crooks are enjoying freedom and total impunity.
@_date: 2018-08-15 05:03:52
Manipulation is hard since you have to possess actual BTC spot (unlike cash settled derivatives/futures).  Also, the amount of BTC available for institutions to own is much smaller than all btc kept by old time hodlers.  How much could institutional manipulators move? Probably not much unless hodlers idiotically panic sell. I think it's already being manipulated so the only difference is the type of manipulator. Lol.

Nobody is trying to "harm" any crap. They are an awesome, feature rich pool and people simply point their miners to them. The fact that they are close to 51% is simply that they ROCK and other pools simply SUCK!.
The way to fix this is not to ban or limit Ghash is that other people build BETTER pools. This is purely a demand and supply play and we have to let the market work efficiently. People have the right to flock to the better supplier. No conspiracy crap. Alternate solution is to simply use p2pool.
@_date: 2018-05-03 05:27:10
This gent is right. It only up to HODLERS If  they want to remain the strong hand or instead surrender to banks to dictate BTC path after what they've done all these years. Wolves will always come as friendly sheep.

Could you please provide us with a step-by-step guide of the setup you are describing? 
Does this require a seedless/watch-only Electrum wallet or which Electrum installation method should we follow?
For those newbies of us, do we have to clone all that github? or how are we supposed to first install Electrum along with the Trezor plugin?

I hear It's being used to quickly onboard new nodes, who initially use Neutrino to start working faster, but after full node background sync up is complete, it stops using BIP157 and only working as full node. Is that still not cool??

It's not any bank but one that distributed private information to black market mercenaries. A KYC honey pot for fools. It's the Facebook of crypto. f*k that crap. Source of Liquidity?? Bitfinex, Binance, Kraken and others can bring more liquidity. The world can do without Coinbase anytime.

I think there has been a large positive outlook in general on the ideas and principles behind this initiative for a  long time.
Andreas Antonopolous has repeatedly said that privacy is of outmost and urgent necessity for bitcoin. So I think this will  greatly help increase value/confidence/security in bitcoin and help cement its dominance in the crypto space.

I guess  they were right but they just got ahead of the market. This is a huge crypto enabler!

Can coins get possibly tainted after using  wasabi/samourai? It wouldn't be fun to get good coins rejected by merchants for being seen as 'mixed' with bad coins.

I understand that it's worth securing the network but that doesn't prevent us from taking any action we can to reduce the environmental problem we are creating. I'm reading a single transaction takes up to 5000 times the energy that one Visa transaction takes. This is insane.
There are great ways to help. For example, buying a certificate to protect trees, which remove CO2, at Standfortrees.com (or any similar organization of your personal choice) should help a lot. 
This is simply about being responsible enough to clean after ourselves. Thanks.

Good news on SegWit and some recommendations to focus on adoption towards the end of their blog.

This was decided by the judge. There are people that had btc and other with fiat balances. Trustee needs to cover those fiat people so that at least they break even. As prices go higher he'd need to sell less coin to cover fiat people until all got their money back.

No threat. It's just Darwin doing its evolutionary genetics work in the financial services.

He's just a MtGox trustee appointed by the Japanese legal system I guess, completely clueless about trading evidently so not necessarily evil-oriented.

After actual tests and research by enterprise market with blockchain , I think this article describes key blockchain use cases to watch for.

This trustee needs more than "advice"! He needs to get his hands slapped until he knows proper trading manners before touching those coins.
@_date: 2018-03-08 06:11:25
Seriously! WTF is wrong with that guy?? For the sake of Bitcoin survival somebody gets a hold of the trustee asap  to use a better mechanism to distribute those coins!!
This is the MtGox trustee communication channel:

Yeah, it's not same thing, bro! Bitcoinwisdom was a REAL difficulty resource, It showed the actual data points for you to tell numerically.

Is there a quick formula to know the BTC break even price for miners? (approximations are welcome too)
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:35:09
Exactly. Some old timers lost a lot of coins in MtGox and this definitely needs to be bubbled up to the right people.
There might be a list of OTC providers that can work in Japan.
If there's anyone in here that experienced MtGox losses, you might want to contact your lawyer to bring this up and have the trustee gets his act together.

I said the risk is now to the downside (less resistance to go up at this point. No need to be dramatic. This is not armageddon but only a correction in the long run) ; not that it's impossible to go further down but So far behaving well..

Too stupid to short at 70% down from ATH. He's way better going long. The risk is now to the downside not the upside. They're not know for being precisely scalpers; they do 10 year bets.

Think about it. You'd be competing against a Ton of money that already got in and he usually doesn't join late. He also owns crypto start-up stock so he'd hurt his own portfolio. You can't  make shit guarantees if you are not an investor. Again, stop thinking he thinks like you.

Are you saying longs were nervous when facing resistance at 9700 so they closed their margin position for profit taking reasons and that caused the drop? But Why they so pussy if the market was going up AND bullish trend had just started?
Shorts would have be the ones paying longs to avoid getting squeezed, no?

I'm sorry you bought at the wrong times but Soros is not you. You are not Soros or the investment world. This article is referring to what actual professional hedge fund managers are doing. That's it. I can't respond for well intended individual/retail market frustrations or even hopes.
My only individual contribution really was that it seems now to be a good time to go long since typically 70% drops are more than enough to at least have a rally. I am more hopeful than not hopeful based on that risk profile. 
Of course, anything can happen and who knows for how long too ;-). 
@_date: 2016-05-28 02:59:37
So what happened? Did it work? 
You are showing a single cable but that setup would require two cables to connect Trezor to the Nexus USB-C port. 
What specifically would be the brand and type of the other cable needed?
I'm trying to use a Nexus 5X and a single, male-to-male USB-C to usb-micro cable  from Kanex but didn't work either. I mean it works 1 out of 10 times after following exactly the same steps every attempt.
Any hope for me?

what do you mean by a ledger individual account? Is there a link to learn more about it?
You are probably talking about storage but Coinbase was not just about storage it was also about buying and selling coins so how is your post useful in that case? Thx

I see but what type of old school OTG cable are you using? The Type C cable you are showing  above requires a male USB 3.0 connector but all the old micro-USB to USB 3.0 OTG cables I have seen around have *female* USB 3.0 connector...

This is loooong overdue and I've heard similar things before but godspeed! I migrated from version 1 to 2.0 beta and it worked but then I tried to further upgrade to 2.02 and "synchronizing" never synchs regardless of server and it seems to force me to reinstall from scratch, losing my contacts and notes....So I quickly reverted to the first beta and I'll probably be stuck forever with it for the remaining of my lifetime.
