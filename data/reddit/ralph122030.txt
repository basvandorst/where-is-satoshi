If you had that money in the bank, what are the chances that someone would hack into it and steal it? 
Close to zero...  Thats why i wont use bitcoin until it is completely secure.

Yes but it also sounds like millions of things that have failed. There's no telling what it will become and it doesn't seem worth the risk

As someone who does not have anything in Bitcoin and was interested in it for a while, it seems like all news is negative. People stealing coins, losing there wallets, scamming, everything. And not so much positive news. The price has been declining and there really hasn't been much news of any substantial advances and its way to difficult for the average person to simply get into it and use it.

Silk road was literally a drug marketplace. Dont pretend like its similar to msg someone on fb for a gram of bud.

He succeeded.

Banks really dont store that much money in their vaults. The vault is actually pretty small and my bank would hold a max of 40k in its vault. 
 We would get shipments from the fed weekly depending how much was deposited/withdrawn. 
Banks don't literally take your money and put it in the vault till you come back.

You... You can't be serious can you?

Lmao great read. 
I really hope that nobody actually believes what that kid is saying, that would just make me kinda sad.  
Buttcoin seems to attract a lot of people with views similar to  How can anyone believe that a ton of wealthy people are running drug rings and that buttcoin is scarring them. Its laughable.

Proper heads up is appreciated in a bank. You and 6 other people could come in and take 6,000 out leaving the banks low on funds. 
Its common sense.

You truly don't belive this do you?

Lmfao, I have 0 experience with bitcoin, nor am I a paid "anti-BTC shill" but i would like to point out why OP has these beliefs. 
I would imagine it would be **[from this thread]( where OP discusses leaving bits as "tips" for waiters instead of actual cash.  
Some of OPs insults to this "paid shill" include: 










**TLDR: Op is a dick to rational people who disagree with him.**

Why would you ever expect a doctor to accept that offer. 
It makes it seem like a scam. 
"Ohhh no I wont pay $10,000 dollars for this surgery!!  But wait... If you take $10,000 dollars worth of my bitcoin i totally will!!"  
Automatically makes me think that the 10 grand of btc is not really worth 10 grand. 
Its like in Better Call Sall when he is helping the man secede from the US and he gives saul a "million dollar retainer" but its in his own form of currency worth nothing.

In my brief 6 months of working as a bank teller I have only ever come accross 1 counterfeit bill. It's really not that frequent.
