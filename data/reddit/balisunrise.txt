IT WAS A JOKE; you didn't have to do it wtf. Nobody expected you to actually do it, this is the one time I would've prefered to be bamboozled. This is the most horrifying thing I've ever seen

Historically, every single time it rises rapidly like it did these past 2 days, it dips again to rise back up slowly this time. you should hold because it'll go back up eventually so there's no need to worry and avoid trying to sell high and buy low because bitcoin also has a history of not acting the way we want and most people who try to day trade end up losing.

anyone knows why it's trading at 14,789 USD in Mexico?

It's crazy that whenever bitcoin goes up I find myself kind of upset because I think "Why didn't I buy more?!" every single time it reaches an all time high instead of being happy it went up.
Instead of being upset over those lost coins you can start investing in it now so you don't kick yourself when it reaches $25k or $100k

You're driving my absolute dream car

is there a set date for when the fork is gonna happen? Or it can happen at any time in November?

that's my fear, im already kicking myself. the reason i don't have those $10k now is because they're in my banks shitty investment fund that gives me 3% and i can't access it until the end of the period

I guess I got the impression that it was pretty much consensus that it's very likely it'll go down before going back up again.
I already have some bitcoin which I don't plan on selling, but wondering if to buy more before or after the fork

Nice design!
