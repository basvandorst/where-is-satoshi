Who would buy colored coins? 
If the community set a good precedent for this situation, that could go a long way.

I think the question may be misleading, here. 
What if the other side's solution does not involve enforcement in the traditional sense? Then your answer will be "No" whether or not such regulation would work. 
Ignoring which side is right, if you ask a biased question, then you will get a biased answer. In this case, if you ask a question from a government mindset, then you will get a government mindset answer. Something hammer, something nail...
Point being: at least start dialogue from a neutral standpoint. From there, an honest discussion can occur. I don't know if you did that intentionally--I do not know you--but try and avoid doing that if you want to actually learn from the dialogue, and not just generate a circle-jerk of a thread.

In months, maybe, but in price fall%? That would be Bitstamp, which is also the longest recovery time after the DDOSs, but only took 10 months of recovery, which supports their conclusion.
I'm glad that they showed all the data instead of cherrypicking just what defended their hypothesis. We can admit that the OP has picked up on something real while still admitting that the data isn't necessarily conclusive.

The fundamental point that has somehow gone unmentioned throughout this entire pointless debate.

Considering that fees with services like PayPal was one of the original claimed perks of using Bitcoin, those fees might be a bit of problem.
PayPal isn't trying to change any systems.

Isn't that what the purpose of the price fall%? You get to see approximately how "bad" the event was, while seeing that the time it took to return has gotten shorter for relatively similar events.
Perfect is the enemy of good.

That's already accounted for. The 75% "threshold" is social, not technical: if the "75%" referenced is the same as the original 75% proposal, then it is actually planned for there to be three adjustment periods before the first &gt;1MB block is mined, which would give plenty of time for an economic majority to transition to how BTC was going to scale.

If anything is "misleading" is that some people have pushed these token values to indicate the value of the tokens post-fork, but what they really represent is the values post-fork, but with BTC-u weighted such that the tokens go to 0 if there is no chain split, which includes the scenario where Core compromises and gives up an increase in blocksize! The fact that the very victory conditions for BU are considered a loss for the token is absurd.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:44:41
Why is it out-of-bounds to point out that the tokens don't exist on even ground? This is a matter of user information: the face-value interpretation of what one would expect these tokens to indicate isn't exactly what they actually indicate, and everyone needs to at least be aware of this fact, lest they perceive this information to be sending signals that aren't actually being sent by this deal.
The markets are working, but the signal they're sending here isn't as conclusive as we should be lead to believe. [because what people seem to assume that they're signaling isn't actually what they're built to signal]

A transaction that is ineffective?
Yeah, that seems to describe more and more bitcoin transactions as each day passes by.

If buying things *in general* requires me to have some of my monetary value in something other than Bitcoin, then I have no interest in Bitcoin. 
I'll probably end up going with whatever deflationary currency that the market ends up deciding on.

Exactly, which is why it confuses me when people called the 2nd rise "tulips", then the 3rd rise "tulips", and now the 4th rise is "tulips" again.

But everyone will be RICH!
If that means that the end of your life will be much, much better, then why care about the theoretical being worse-off that the future ruling classes would have been? 
@_date: 2017-01-24 05:17:31
The actual explanation is way more boring.
The regular, consistent rate of transactions were already too heavy for 1mb per 10 minutes to sustain. For the past difficulty session, we were running ~1mb per 8.5 minutes, and that was just enough to keep a backlog from forming. Now that the difficulty has adjusted back to 1mb per 10 minutes, the network cannot handle what used to be completely standard flow without backing up. 
Some people may scream "spam!", but this was much more benign [predictable, even!] event.

The ticker symbols aren't what define the deal that is being made in these tokens. In this case, the terms of the deal are biased against BU. To be clear, _this is not a problem_*, so long as you understand the token values are not representing an equal comparison, but a comparison that is biased toward BCC. [i.e. if the tokens were equally valued, that would represent really bad news for BCC]
*that is, the tokens should still accurately represent the likelihood of the terms that they represent, so one should inform themselves of what those terms precisely are.
Other people have explained the bias in the tokens, so that you can understand what the tokens are truly representing the value of. Reference those and you will get a better idea of what they represent, and therefore will understand why, if any other organization creates unbiased tokens, the value _will not_ be close to bitfinex's tokens.

If you ever find a currency that doubles in value consistently and permanently, then let me know! Until then, that's a hypothetical that isn't connected to the real world.

I would love for them to coexist! The issue is that, if Bitcoin Legacy is destroyed, it will only be because of the decisions that this chain has made [i.e. strict adherence to 1MB blocks], and there's nothing that any supporter of Bitcoin Cash can do to fix that, even if they want to.

"Big blocker" here, can confirm that layer-2 solutions are awesome when they aren't forced onto every single individual who wants a usable Bitcoin.

Miners don't have to even mine full blocks if they don't want to, so they don't even need a spam attack to achieve the effect you're referring to. [although they would probably prefer to only accept transactions over a certain sat/B instead of purely empty if they wanted to attack the network _and_ get paid something to do so] I'm not even sure if a spam attack would be beneficial to this effect, perhaps you could explain why?
And, either way, we can see by looking at the total pending transaction fees that the ecosystem proper is running completely on schedule, so we can rest _assured_ that there is no colluding miner attacking the network at this time. And even if there _is_ a spammer trying to, he's learning why spam was never the actual root cause of the problems by the fact that we've cleared out the mempool within a day, and no bitcoin user that isn't also on a forum even knew it was happening!
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:58:07
Ironically, this is actually the only "spam attack" that has occurred, and makes clear one fact of actual "spam" that seems to have never been made that obvious. 
Look at the history of the mempool--not in size, but in _pending transaction fees_. This reveals something critical: while the mempool might have increased in terms of size, in terms of **fees required to get onto a block in a reasonable time**, the network is running almost identically to how it would any other day. Spam attacks **don't work**, they never have worked [at least, in the terms of the kinds of things that they're accused of having done], and what has slogged down the network in the past and accused of being "spam" was simply the native demand for blockspace overloading the native supply of blockspace.
But, as it stands, spam does not slog the network down. It simply cannot as long as your network isn't working close to capacity, and the only way it can have _any_ meaningful impact on the ecosystem's ability to use bitcoin is it the spammer uses a massive amount of money on the fees for his transaction, outpricing other transactions. But even then, all he does is create a different baseline for a fee market, and the network will still operate as per usual above that fee baseline, which is completely distinct from the behavior of a slogged down network, where the fees rise endlessly because _increasing fees do not increase blockspace_.

Then it's a good thing that the exact situation this thread was made for is making Bitcoin as unspendable as possible, huh?
