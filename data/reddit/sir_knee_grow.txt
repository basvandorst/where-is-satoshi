We need someone to analyze this data ASAP...

Everything about this comment is wrong 
@_date: 2014-10-15 01:34:37
The next few comments are crucial.

I condone this comment above.
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:37:16
We do NOT know that he commented on his post.
Wait for verification.
Spell Dorian right too.

Hey Funkee, hopefully you remember me!
You've come a LONG LONG way with your app!!!
Do you have any plans to add cryptsy?
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:07:09
Thank you Arthur.
Do you think Dorian would accept the funds being raised here 
[Fundraising Link](
(At the time of writing this has raised $ 25,637.40)
for this horrible inconvience caused by Newsweek?
I'm sure, as a community, we as Reddit want to say some things that will help to quell the anger that you have.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:59:21
No problem :-D
@_date: 2014-03-10 05:49:39
Seriously, she PLANS her **hallmark** trip to Dorian's front door (part of her TWO MONTH ordeal), and doesn't even anticipate anything enough to produce a Camera, let alone anything that can record audio?

Some comments on how Karpeles is acting, he seems batshit scared out of his pants, i think he's even mumbling something out of nervousness or it's not very well communicated through the mike.
I mean, even if public speaking isn't your thing, the style of speech just reeks of nervousness/anxiety, whether you think this is a good thing (worried about your money/a useless piece of shit) is your choice to make.
Another note i made, he made a constant effort to bow down 100% as much as he can, even going lower during the bowing as an effort (Bowing is a huge part of proper japanese etiquette.
Mark Karpeles:
As for the Bitcoin problem, there were sufficient checks in place, but all the Bitcoin went bye bye. (I say bye bye because the word he used, and the style of speech (informal) was pretty low for a business press release... word choice is the level of an elementary student)
Obviously, this caused is a big deal, and a bad thing to happen (to my customers) and caused a big inconvenience to everyone, and I am extremely sorry about this.


I think this is well enough confirmation that Mt. Gox singlehandledy buttfucked themselves and has nothing to do with the Gov giving a gag order to Karpeles.
Comment if you have a better translation, as this is as best I can do.

I speak fluent Japanese, first language was japanese, and have been speaking ever since.
  
Edit: He think's he is sorry.

Then quick, transfer to another wallet
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:00:32
Yeah, I always wondered why the process is so hard, since pools usually publish found blocks
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:34:51
Nope. We know neither.
You are basing both of these off of the p2p foundation "confirmation" which has NO evidence that it is from him.
There is NO PGP signature, NOTHING to prove that it is him.
For all we know it could be a hacked account, or admins fucking with us.
Move along now.

@_date: 2014-03-10 23:57:02
by the leaker, he made the program to steal wallets and included screenshot to make it look legit
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:30:19
I still get this like, instinctive feeling almost, that somehow he is involved.
I just don't know what to think :(
@_date: 2014-05-27 03:29:29
It's okay, i'm not having any luck untwirling it
@_date: 2014-05-27 03:32:30
Considering the dates on the transactions,
His step father spent around $55,000 assuming a $900 USD/BTC rate.

You see this is the correct mentality, once you put in more than you're willing to risk you're erring on the side of destructive gambling.

I need to stop opening random .exes
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:29:03
You COULD move to a browser based wallet system like 
Or if you want to keep it physically, make a paper wallet!
If you're worried about people going on your computer and then stealing it, store it somewhere else, like on a website, or in your safe.
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:33:00
I'm personally saying it is NOT collusion, or just an act.
I saw the dogecointipbot movement start, netcodepool doesn't have the resources to make it himself, hence putting the bounty up.
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:30:24
What does it mean!!!!
Oh god
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:19:27
coinedup is inaccurate, no one wants to trade on there.
but at the same time, it's a shitton of money, you can't deny that :P
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:32:15
You mean fractions of the conversion from USD to BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:05:37
It's all your choice! But you might want to take a look at going at a more traditional routes. Maybe do some simulations, and start there, even if it is just a little bit of money, good values and mindset is never bad for the starter.
