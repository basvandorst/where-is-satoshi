Also, the title is only 40% true. 10 words, the only ones that are true is "$5,000,000 in bitcoin donated". As you know, because you responded to the comment that points it out, UBI requires everyone involved gets it. The truth is that $5,000,000 was donated to a social welfare for the poor program.

Don't misunderstand, I think it would be awesome if you won. Assuming of course you have the rocks to maintain your conviction. But lets be honest, Texas isn't exactly liberal and your running against a very conservative incumbent. 
I mean at the end of the day it doesn't really matter. I had a discussion over dinner tonight with a friend who reminded me that the American people are so disillusioned with the entire electoral process and subsequent governing parties being so strongly influenced by corporate interests. 
The point is, even if you do win, why in the hell would any of us bother believing you could get anything done. Or would really want to. I mean at the end of the day its just a means to a fat paycheck

No one is doubting FIAT needs a replacement, but as far as what will replace it I am less confident it's actually BTC and not an alt-crypto that either currently exists and fixes the BTC flaws, or a method that's yet to be developed. Etherium looks promising for a number of reasons.
BTC at this point has become a method for the wealthy to inflate their wealth. It's a continual pump and dump scheme taking money from the informed and funneling it into the pockets of whales with enough currency to move the market. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:42:56
It cost me $11 dollars to make a transaction last night, moving roughly .5 btc to a paper wallet for long term storage. 
I have my doubts it will be BTC unfortunately. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:28:18
Because having it process in an hour gives me peace of mind sooner, which is worth the $11 to me. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:57:55
My man, I bought in at under $100 and mined extensively before ASICs were ever a thing. I'm telling you, this is the same cycle over and over. Every year I buy a little more after these massive rallies die down. I've made my money back over and over and over. But to call BTC a currency is like calling treasury bonds a currency. Sure, it has value, and people trade them, and you could even buy a house with them if you found a motivated seller, but it's not a "currency" in the traditional sense of the word. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:31:40
That wasn't express. That was the standard suggested fee according to blockchain.info. Express was $17.

Bitcoin transactions become expensive. 


@_date: 2017-11-29 14:49:05
The biggest hurdle facing $100,000 in my opinion is the fact that we're still using the btc denomination. Inexperienced new users aren't immediately aware they don't have to buy a full btc to get in. Explaining to users what a uBTC is and how it's currently worth a little more than a penny each makes things easier. 
"I can't afford BTC, it's like $11,000."
"You can buy 2000 uBTC for $20!" 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:17:49

Well individuals don't really get involved in fractional reserve. That's really just banks lying about how much money they have. 
But stocks. I would say the majority of Americans over 25 are aware of the basics of stock trading and have money invested in 401k or other retirement plans. So I wouldn't say "most" normal people don't know about stocks. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:02:33
Yup. I was just having a conversation last night with someone who is usually pretty "tech savy". He's the help desk type that knows enough to be considered a "computer guy" but he didn't understand this at all. He was asking questions like "What happens when someone hacks a large datastore" and "With the price so high how could normal people buy in?" 
Your average Joe doesn't understand any of this at all and hasn't moved past "considering learning about it". 
I was actually going to exit my positions last night until I talked to him and realized that market saturation is minimal.

And the fight begins. This is why I've been watching bitcoin. Anyone with half a mind worth of sense saw this coming, I just want to see it play out. Will you defy the law to maintain your digital currency? Will you adhere to the law laying bitcoin at the feet of the wealthy? Or will you abandon your cause? :)
Human nature on display right now. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:16:17
Ok, here's the long and short. Everyone here will likely tell you to throw everything you have into it, and they very well may be right.
This is a HIGH RISK investment. As in so high risk I don't think you could fit it on a risk matrix. HOWEVER, the returns over the last three years have been .59% a DAY, that's huge.
At the same time, this is not designed to be a commodity or an investment vehicle, even though for a lot of us it acts as one. I would encourage you, if you decide to purchase, to read up on exactly what you're walking into in great detail and also SPEND THE COINS YOU BUY. Use them as a currency as well as hold onto some as an investment.

$40,000 is $684,315.91 after 24 years in a Vanguard balanced composite index averaging 11.54% annually (average return over the last 3 years).
This will provide enough income to allow me to retire at 50 and get me through until my actual retirement benefits kick in at 65. 
I will likely see a higher return due to playing a riskier investment index for the first decade and reducing risk over time. 
Not too bad for a $4,000 investment. :)
EDIT: These numbers are dependent on a relatively quick jump to $1500. However any time knocked off of my working years is a good investment.

Yea, but that's a hassle, and with rate fluctuation and fees and the requirement to link a bank account etc etc (I.E. can't be done with paypal) it's easier to get cash.

For 63 million you could buy enough 55nm chips from Avalon to match the current 6500 TH/S network rate. You could do a 51% attack by being your own pool for 63 million dollars. 
If a government really wanted to shut this thing down it wouldn't be that hard. Programs I work on spend more than that monthly. 
Considering you would only need about half that in reality, you can say this entire thing can be obliterated for ~30m.

@_date: 2013-11-30 17:07:51
While this may be true, one of the core lures of bitcoin is the fact that we're in control of our wallets, and our funds. It's appealing not to need anyone else to pay and receive payments.

Assuming 3% average inflation it will still provide $317,313.68 of purchasing power. On top of standard savings and the reduction in expenses considering my home will be paid off by then I don't see any issue with it.

It's a bubble. It's not the first we've seen. I'm just betting on the odds here (like everyone else is) and assuming that like most bubbles it will settle down well below where everyone expects it during this mania phase. I think we're headed towards the blow-off phase.
This is the dotcom bubble all over again. I'm going short. 
Edit: To clarify, I believe bitcoin has staying power, at least for a bit, but long term I'm doubtful. I think it will settle at about 20 bucks per coin and rise steadily with standard inflation. There are currently 11m coins floating around if I'm not mistaken, so at 20 each that's only 220m dollars, that's just not enough to keep it around long term.

I think bitcoin is an interesting concept, and I understand exactly what you are saying and I mirror your concerns. However, I do like the wallet being able to be stored locally, I like to keep a backup.
However, I'm afraid for the very reasons you've stated BitCoin wont see mainstream acceptance. However, it will fill a very vital role. It will provide a proof of concept for the future digital currency system. Bitcoin is complicated, I'm a SysAdmin so I'm pretty used to clients "not getting it", this is currently way outside of the scope most of my clients would understand, let alone be comfortable with.
BitCoin has done an amazing job for what it is, a concept. The next iteration, the one that gets simplicity right will be the one I jump on.

If they drop down to 20 per coin like I expect them to I'll invest at that point. I'm waiting for this bubble to die down before I assess the long term value of this. Honestly, I have more faith in litecoin based on scrypt.

@_date: 2013-04-18 00:26:25
A stop-loss is something offered by most brokers. It's when you set an "auto-sell" point. So for instance if I short BTC at 90 because I expect them to be about 20 bucks each this time next year (which I do) I can say "stop my loss at 120" which means if they reach 120 I automatically sell them at that price and my loss is only 30 per coin. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:43:37
I don't think $250 is greedy. I think that's about the correct price. The last six days have seen "abnormal" growth rates. I was waiting for this dip, it's not over yet. I still think it will fall below $250, but $250 is my buy-in point. (On the opposite end of the scale, if I'm wrong then $375 is my upper buy in point)

I think you miss the point. Even if your message is valid it's delivery is detrimental. First of all, stop implying your audience is ill informed. We're well aware of what your suggesting. Secondly, stop telling people to google things, it's pompous.
Finally, if you want bitcoin to succeed it has to go mainstream, in order for it to do that merchants have to accept it. What business owner is going to accept a currency designed to make the system they thrive under fail? Really? Get a grip man. If you want to win you have to win the hearts and minds, not scream and stomp your feet.

@_date: 2013-12-09 20:06:22
Honestly it wouldn't surprise me if they were.
If I were the government, and I saw this currency as feasible I would build a 10,000 TH/S farm and wait. Once I feel everyone is adequately invested I would attack the blockchain. Not to destroy it, or to change it, but to control it absolutely.
I could then use it as a national digital currency and make whatever changes I want to the source by rendering any blocks not coming from someone with my version of the client to be rejected.

I'm taking this money out of money I was saving for a paintball gun, I don't really want to make this my entire life.
This is more an experiment to see if we can trust each other enough to trade. Because if it takes a middle man every time someone wants to spend some money I'm afraid my outlook for this isn't good.

My *guess* is yes. But it's really just a guess. I honestly expected a bigger dip the other day when we saw it drop to ~$300. 
It's hard to guess. I know I personally feel that itch to unload soon.

Unless you're not retarded and you implement a stop loss?

She's eluding to a lot of future regulation in my opinion, without committing anyone to actually implementing it. And her entire focus is on the illegal activities taking place in BTC.

I'm working on it. :p

My mistake, I'm sorry. I thought they were recent adopters. Thank you for correcting it. :)

You must be new here... you can find gambling sites with 99.9% odds. Also they have a zero risk solution called a laundry...

The comments clearly outline police mentality and unwillingness to learn. It shows us that our nations police force is quickly becoming incompetent in the digital age.

I like how Lowery opens up with "The issues and threats of digital currency". :(

But your prices aren't market prices.
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:43:45
What makes you feel that way?
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:41:31
Woot! My first ever bitcoin fraction! Thanks. :)

You work for goldcoin don't you? Also, isn't goldcoin centralized?

So does this mean you're only paying 5 people?

I know a couple people who do this regularly to buy on margin. 
The bank kicks it back, coinbase changes the status to canceled, you get an overdraft fee.
