I like this comparison, BUT you missed the mark a little.. the breaking point when paypal's exorbitant pricing model really starts to become most evident is about the $2000.00 mark. it arises sooner if you make multiple transactions to get to that $2000.00 mark. (i.e. if you process 20x$100 transactions you're already paying an additional $6 in transaction fees alone)
I have done heaps of these comparisons over the years as i work in payments and all i can say is paypals advertising is spectacular, the provide an over priced product and the majority of people to do not realise.
If you re-do your figures with $2000.00 you will find that the gap will be much much wider, i haven't run any comparisons on bitcoin but i do believe it will come out at the top of the pack.

While i understand your point, you are referring to people processing 20k-30k per month, they are not micro-merchants, nor do they fall under the paypal base rate i believe the volume breaks start kicking in at 5k per month.
So yes a company that has a buy rate of say 0.90% on Visa/Mc/Discover and maybe 2% on Amex can afford to wear a 4% fee on some transactions which go through paypal. but you would not setup a merchant account strictly through paypal as it is essentially throwing about upwards of 2% of credit card turnover.
Personally i think we will see someone like RBS or FDI combine bitcoin in their card processing environment so your facility will accept both CC and crypto.
Okay it probably wont be RBS or FDI as they are just too big and sluggish, but it will be a smaller player who will then get bought out by either of those companies.
Also in some markets it is all about price, hell i can pick up new merchants in the US by knocking a basis point off their current rates because the cumulative total of that 1 basis point can run into the thousands or hundred of thousands of dollars.

Paypal bad..
People signup because its easy, and truth be told if you are processing less than 2k / month you will probably not find a better deal as you are essentially a micro-merchant.
I am always surprised to see large companies with large transaction volumes opting for paypal, even with volume breaks they still charge a ridiculous amount of money.
lesson here is, use paypal if you must, but if you break 2k/month there is a better deal out there for you. If you are processing less than 2k / month sadly you are kind of stuck with them.
in regards to bitcoin, some smart cookie will find a way to integrate bitcoin into a merchant processing bundle at some point, so the ability to accept bitcoin will be no different to adding Amex to the cards you can process through your conventional merchant terminal.

Congratulations on your $450 investment, may your $300 provide you with a valuable investment in 10 years.
Spending $486 on a crypto currency is a big step, but the $512 you have spent will be beneficial to you in the future.

Try to page Lamar Wilson into this thread, maybe he can explain the encryption so people can actually help.
I did a bit of digging around and that is his user name but it appears to have been inactive for a year. :(
EDIT: also from one of his threads on reddit..
"Essentially, logging out only destroys the locally saved wallet. But the wallet is backed up on our servers encrypted, so you don't lose access to your keys, if choose to log out."
Give MD5 a go as that would be most obvious.

Okay.. remove bitcoin from the equation so this makes sense.
This is no different to buying something from an EU website and paying in USD which is converted to EURO via your bank or CC provider. The merchant receives EURO, you pay in USD.
So say you buy something for 100 EURO, that amount is converted to USD and a USD amount is billed to your card. 
If a refund is given the merchant refunds 100 EURO, which is the converted back to USD to your card.
So the price will always be different, that is of course unless the conversion rate is identical to the day you purchased the item. So there will always be a discrepancy in value. 
When it comes to BTC though the difference can be worth $200+ as in your case, but ultimately what you paid in BTC was returned to you, so the merchant has done the right thing, they do not dictate the market conditions, nor should they have to reimburse you the difference.
did you receive the same amount of bitcoin you paid back? if the answer is yes then then i see no problem.
The value you spent was $X btc, the amount returned to you is $X btc, i don't think anyone has ripped you off, but you should read up on currency conversion as what they have done is completely normal when dealing with foreign currencies so why should it be any different for crypto?
