This is exactly what we should be avoiding

That is so low... Wow
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:38:40
I'm also curious about the electrical requirements here.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:28:12
There's still mining going on even if LN scales.
Just significantly reduced, yes?
Reduced by 100x? 1000x?

Will every wallet and place that accepts Bitcoin have to somehow implement this?
Look at segwit, that's such a good idea and it still has taken forever and not really many have done it.
Will this be the same case here?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:22:38
Any major differences between this one and Trezor?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:37:53
Coinbase reward?
As well, I think the electrical needs must be mitigated. It's bad enough in the current state let alone as it gets more expensive.
As well, I hope the LN can be of use for this. I suppose I need to reread the original paper for LN.

What is a better US accessible exchange in your mind?

I totally hear you on this one. I will be traveling with it to Amsterdam soon and I'm trying to make every purchase I can with it.
When I post about it or and people ask me about it I try and divert away from the price and into how powerful of a network and idea it is.

I have some extra raspberry Pi's. Will these work well or should I just go get a cheap and crappy laptop?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:39:05
Can anyone explain the liquidity Spike he mentioned? I think that would be well worth a look at as far as timing goes
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:03:51
Thank you for the response. I will look into getting a laptop.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:54:32
Those of you who use it for purchases? Do you immediately buy back in with USD afterwards so as to not leech your position?
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:43:32
Excellent reply, thank you for explaining your perspective. I will certainly take that with a grain of salt and I look forward to seeing how the field evolves over the next few weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:05:56
I sure will keep you posted! Going there in a week
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:48:47
Thank you so much for the helpful links I will be sure to do some more research this afternoon!
Keep up the good work!

I have two follow up questions to make sure I'll actually be contributing and not getting this wrong.
1) Does it absolutely need to be running 24/7?
2) Is bandwidth a concern? What is the minimum requirement? Will dipping below this harm the effectiveness of my node OR the network as a whole?
Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:09:23
Thank you for the reply. Timing this, or looking out for this spike, or the potential for one, is of interest to myself - and others I am sure.
Would it logically follow that such a spike would not be a long term event or a sustainable price increase? Such as it would be "shorted" soon thereafter?
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:46:23
I'm frankly not sure if that's the case.
When I set it up it made me write down of course the 12 words seed as well as the key so I'm pretty sure that's all there.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:44:22
Excellent, thank you so much. I look forward to getting a real cheap laptop and hopefully I can get this thing up and running and do my part!
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:48:21
That's too funny I literally did it for the same reason initially
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:05:21
What factors will cause this rise to pop?
What triggers should we look for.
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:06:20
Yeah, near WA it's only 4% as well
