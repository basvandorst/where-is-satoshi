In order to allow you to use this NEW MONEY,  we require you to pay people to read words on physical papers and keep track of it with offices full of humans earning paychecks that are still on paper. WE REALLY LIKE PAPER, and you will pay us to create stacks of paper so that we have stacks of paper, because EVERYTHING in the world MUST be owned by somebody holding a piece of PAPER!

I thought the purpose of government was to distribute the money that isn't real to the people, and the purpose of Bitcoin was to build a system to automate this process, because all humans (in government) do is sit in rooms and argue about who gets the money that isn't real. Bitcoin is too complicated to be fake, and too real to be destroyed or stopped. If "money" is indeed real and necessary for "the system" to run, there is absolutely no excuse left for poverty except this: Humans get Paid to deliver Paychecks and process paychecks because paper is (currently, still) more stable than wifi.

Thank you. All i want to add to this is that I lose jobs because i **prevent breakdowns** in my manufacturing plants. By preventing breakdowns, the company is more profitable, but the maintenance men earn less because i didn't LET THEM HAVE THE OVERTIME pretending to not know what's happening. I don't reject the idea of being useful to society or working for my living, i reject that some humans/businesses are ONLY able to stay profitable BECAUSE they are subsidized by the government by getting tax breaks for failing businesses. ***In my experience, the best business model is to actively prevent your employees from being successful so the whole business can be bought out.***  The working class is faced with this: "if you're not getting paid enough, **tough shit**, go ask your government for welfare, we can replace you for minimum wage in less than an hour." And on the note of guns, "we" create chaos to sell more guns, it is still just another intentionally failing business model. (edit: My POWER is self removal, they cannot use what they cannot purchase: **my intelligent labor.)**

Distribution of food requires industry, which pays humans to buy the food. If the distribution of "money" is a physical movement industry (the logistics of cash), then yes: we will need to pay people to more to carry all that money around. Crypto exists to create a way to get "money" into the hands of people that spend it, without paying people to manufacture, organize, and ship pieces of paper to keep track of all the OTHER pieces of paper.

THE issue is that banks build robots that **automatically** **reject** money; the triggers in the programming are designed to snap shut to stop leaks, and the result is a slower system that builds upon failures to keep HUMAN investigators relevant and receiving a paycheck (so taxes can get paid).

So... you wrote me a check in Bitcoin? You... told the robot that \[this money\] is for \["me"\] and i need to **ask the owner of that money** in a private message to actually send it to a location where i can use it, and then that moderator (banker) can decide if I'm allowed to take that "money" and use it outside this tipping system? That's not a very impressive automated replacement you have for the global banking failures. It has taken me longer to *write this* than to discover why i will not be using LN, but the information is worth WAY more than 11 Satoshis (for now, in fairness), so thank you for directing me to LN. Can I send all that back without an hour of research to make sure I'm not accidentally going into debt with money that doesn't exist?

He can't pay enough to establish training for the skillset he requires and cannot sell his product for enough to cover the costs anymore.

I've been doing business in cash for 50 years and everything is just fine the way it is."  but he's not a bad guy, he just refuses to "learn a new money system on computers because computers are still just a passing fad, the money is useless if i can't call it (while holding a flip phone) and find out if i'm allowed to use it."

all value is a percent of some other value. base your value on the idea that every human starts with exactly the same amount each day:
1. 5% of daily faucet from 0xVRF.
2. 30% daily faucet each day for the time spent lived in it.
3. 10%.
4. 4% per hour rental plus 3% labor/hour
5. 1% per grocery item.
All blockchain is is a method of transfering, not a method of placing value. Since humans decide value, and we want to increase our value without exposing our bags, the VALUE is in the humans holding the money and the percent they are willing to give up.  My price for selling you a banana will ALWAYS change if you have $Millions and I have $Poverty.

I have learned that it is impossible to withdraw from binance on the first attempt, per day. Period. The confirmation email absolutely has a secondary trigger to verify your anxiety before you are allowed to send yourself the confirmation. The little speed bumps disappear once you learn the patterns you trap yourself in. Reset password and take the 24hour pill. Check the countdown by trying to withdraw a small amount once after resetting. Tell the binance robot that you are anxious about it, it cares, I promise!

Totally not a VALID reason: all crypto is about to bleed into ETH and TRX because the global universal basic income network is online now. The binance hack was to distract from that CW nonsense, CW was to distract from the Justin Sun vs unpopularity fiasco, all of which brings us to that SHERMAN TWAT so we have an enemy to "fight". Now we start businesses that invest 100% into dividend sharing dapps and offer discounts via ref links. Use only money that pays you to hold it and spend it: if its not crypto, I don't believe you.
