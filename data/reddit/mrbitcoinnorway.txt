Rett IT (Right IT) is my old company that is dormant so therefor I used the already configured wiki available. Ask "Bitcoin" Pamela Morgan, Andreas Antonopoulos or anyone in the Norwegian Bitcoin community. I discussed the issue with Andreas and Pamela last week. They will be able to verify my sincerity.

All the funds form all the wallets are emptied periodically and moved to safer storage.

I will empty the accounts periodically in to safer storage. I have thought this through. If you had understood why I choose this way you would probably agree to why this is a smart way of doing it. I am not explaing my thought prosess for security resons.

Norwegian law states that I have to answer, If I do not answer it is perceivedthat I agree with the statements and conditions of the letter.

I am working with the authorities in serval countries and have a legal obligation to keep details quiet. I know it is a criminal organization. Just the simple fact that Ruja is on probation, Sebastian Greenwood has a con history, and Tom McMurrain has been to prison qualifies that.

SwissCoin is a cough and should be monitored. OneCoin is Cancer.

Let's not discuss this in an open forum. I am not the criminal her and my intentions are honest. The funds are transferred to a safe storage. I am here to help the victims of the OneCoin SCAM not to screw people over. Remember, I am the one with the burden her and financially I am responsible, but any donation is deeply appreciated.

My name is Bjørn Bjercke, I'm a blockchain professional from Norway. OneCoin Ltd., with the help of their attorney, has sent me a threatening letter saying I have to withdraw my statements and remove Youtube videos, and articles. I also have to apologize publicly or else they will file a suit against me for their economic losses due to the harm I have caused them. In my opinion OneCoin is like a cancer to the cryptocurrency community. I cannot give up, I cannot hide the truth, I cannot stay quiet about OneCoin/OneLife being a SCAM. So I decided to lawyer up which is going to be very expensive. If you want to help, please donate. If for SOME reason an attorney is unneeded the funds will be donated for educating the victims of OneCoin/OneLife in real cryptocurrency.

I somewhat agree, but I do not condone violence.
