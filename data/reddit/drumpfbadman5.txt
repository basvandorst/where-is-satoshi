Giving your financial and identity information to Faceberg is an incredibly bad idea, given they've shown that they aren't above giving it out/selling to identity thieves.

They'll care when Faceberg steals their money because they posted a meme that its censors disliked.
And you can be assured they will consider any funds held by them to be *theirs*, especially if they decide to unilaterally close the user's account due to some joke they find offensive (i.e., any joke).

Whether or not you think that, the Federal Reserve and its usury scam is largely controlled by jewish people, and has been from the beginning.
The majority of all Fed chairs have been jewish, despite jewish people being less than 2% of the US population. 
Let's not pretend that reality doesn't exist simply because it might be inconvenient for jewish people.

Given how little hash power they have it would be pretty easy for Bitcoin miners to 51% attack BCH and BSV.

Well the thing claiming to be Mark Zuckerberg is actually a reptilian, so that seems possible.

Facebook is going to use this to harvest financial data and SSNs and sell them to their shady black market for user data.
Using Faceberg's shitcoin will be deliberately giving away your identity to identity thieves.

My guess is that denotes when the contract closes, e.g., end of day or end of month.

Imagine listening to someone who isn't smart enough to understand the Federal Reserve fiat usury scam.

Thanks for your MSM approved shilling content, it's so informative. Please tell us how to think so we can be good little drones like you are.


I'm a Bitcoin maximalist and think it's going in the right direction, duh.


Says the guy who started whining in the first place, because the TV told him to. You're a pathetic mindless drone who does whatever your little MSM puppet masters want you to. I'm surprised you aren't calling for Bitcoin to be banned like your TV politicians tell you to.

Yeah it's not a revolutionary concept, it's a retarded concept that has never worked in history and we can currently see the end result of it in Venezuela.
Let's stop pretending that hyperinflation is some sort of clever fix.

Rumors are the OTC market in general has been dried up for a while. My personal theory is that that's exactly why we say "Bitcoin Steve" or whatever it's supposed to be buy $100m worth across three exchanges: there simply wasn't anywhere else to get that volume because OTCs are out of sellers.
The meandering low price we saw was because all the whales were buying outside of exchanges, IMO.

Shocker that he's a duplicitous worm.

I mean it's nothing really crazy. It's just an article about a slightly more exclusively OTC exchange than the others.

They don't really have enough viewers to be said to have a demographic at all. No MSM "news" does at this point.
Random shitty YouTube 'personalities' have 10s of millions more daily viewers than the bulk of the MSM primetime combined. Sounds crazy but it's true and you can look up and compare the numbers yourself.
@_date: 2019-05-20 05:58:25
Even if 90% of YT numbers were fake, they'd still have millions more viewers than MSM.

The decimal precision will just be increased so we can go to 10ths, 100ths, and 1000ths of a satoshi.

No way you would get those coins for a total of $31bn, though, which is the point.
Hell even the lady doing this says "it's not possible to realize that", because the supply would dry up real fast at current prices if someone started accumulating that much.
Plus, the actual *traded* coins are a lot smaller percentage than those that are non-lost. So it would cost even more than if you were factoring against the 14m number.

You mean China's trade war they have been waging 100% one sided for decades, right?
Because regardless of whether CNN tells you this or not, China has been putting tariffs on ALL our shit for decades and we have none on theirs, so it's actually and always has been their trade war against the US.
Stop being so damned ignorant, it's embarrassing.
