Sure thing.  
1.  Go to a local store.  You can pick up a prepaid credit card.  Greendot is a typical supplier of these.  These typically run $5 or less.
2.  MoneyPak is an intermediate entity to load prepaid cards.  Therefore, once you have the prepaid card, you purchase MoneyPaks to load it.  You can purchase them using cash.  Or, more interestingly, you can use BTCPak.com to purchase a MoneyPak.  You will receive a 14-digit code that you will type in on the MoneyPak website.
3.  Use your prepaid card to purchase goods. 
Let me know if you have any other questions.

The service is automated.  
I think the MoneyPak API you are thinking about is to ACCEPT MoneyPaks.  I also tried to get access to this API without much success.  However, I am selling MoneyPaks, therefore I do not need access to the API.

Thank you.  However, I have to give credit where credit is due. 
While I did all of the backend programming, I actually hired a man who goes by "phraust" to do the website design.  I couldn't be happier with the results, he did a fantastic job.  You should have seen the site before I implemented his changes.  The only html was &lt;b&gt;
And, obviously, he was paid using Bitcoins.

I would be interested in taking a look at that.  Is it available online?

I am going to provide a shame-less plug (spam?) for BTCPak.com.  There you can purchase a MoneyPak for Bitcoins.  You can then use that to load numerous prepaid cards that you can purchase at Walmart or pretty much any local convenient store.  
Please let us know if you have any questions or need assistance.

There are a couple of commits to the Bitcoin daemon that let you see more information about each transaction.  I haven't implemented those yet, but plan to in the future.  For now I am leaning on a third-party for verification.

I am hoping that this post doesn't appear "spammy" (although, it kind of does).  I would like to start a discussion about a service I launched, BTCPak.com.
BTCPak allows you to exchange your Bitcoins for MoneyPaks.  We offer $100, $250 and $500 denomination MoneyPaks.  
The process is straight forwards.  You simply select the denomination of MoneyPak and provide a refund address in case something goes wrong.  You are then provided with a Bitcoin address to send your deposit to.  After 6 confirmations, a MoneyPak code is displayed.
We also accept the Mt. Gox green address, allowing for instant transactions.
I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the website.

Although at first glance it appears not to have caught on, I have the opposite experience.
BTCPak recognizes the Mt.Gox green address.  I would say about 20% of our transactions are initiated via the green address. 
I don't really care what we call it, but I wish more services would implement it.
