It's not that they don't understand the technology.  It's that they don't understand the *economics*.
Fixed supply + cheaper to store than gold + cheaper to send/receive than gold + impossible to counterfeit + easy to hide + programmable + huge network effect + extreme convexity

This "either-or" debate is missing the point.  Bitcoin is a unique and entirely new form of a store of wealth.
Chinese billionaires park their money in LA and NYC real estate.  That's why apartments and homes often go for $100 million there.  Billionaires also park their money in Picasso (and other famous) paintings.  The paintings themselves aren't actually worth that much money. They're just being used as a form of currency by the very rich.
These paintings and real estate are extremely illiquid compared to the stuff that's traded on major markets.  And the process of selling/buying/storing them is expensive and time consuming.  Yet rich people still toss money at them.
This is the route Bitcoin will likely take, at least in the medium term (before internet and computer technology catches up).  Bitcoin will appreciate massively and the price per transaction will skyrocket (not measured in terms of BTC, but in terms of dollars).  And that's okay.
Eventually trustworthy services will exist to trade "BTC backed" digital tokens.  And people will voluntarily agree to use them because they periodically mathematically prove their reserves.  This will increase transactions per second, but also increase risk slightly.
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:27:49
It's a joke.  I'm making fun of people who think Bitcoin can't scale because transactions providers wouldn't be trustworthy and would need to use the blockchain directly.
@_date: 2015-06-06 14:00:54

@_date: 2015-06-07 17:18:24
Another important thing for people to keep in mind is that Bitcoin's nature makes it an open and international competition to have the fastest, most trustworthy transactions processor.  Heavy regulations in this kind of environment simply aren't possible to sustain long term.

This is important to read (especially for newbies) because it shows how Bitcoin goes through phases of popularity, followed by stagnation, then abandonment, then cycling back to popularity.  Each cycle adds more permanent holders and contributors.  And this was true even back in the early days.

You're assuming everyone is equal.  Which is understandable, because you probably grew up in an egalitarian society.  But average people don't matter.  Bitcoin will first be adopted by intellectual and financial elites.
Average people won't demand it until it's too late, and their fiat is worthless paper.

@_date: 2015-06-01 17:06:06
How bout we let prices work?  As transaction costs climb and (possibly?) the Bitcoin price falls, miners will voluntarily and quickly raise block sizes.

@_date: 2015-06-17 03:30:32

@_date: 2015-06-08 04:26:01
At that point there probably wouldn't be a need for money.  Everything would be duplicable at the atomic level, virtual reality would be impossible to distinguish from the real world, biotech would make everyone permanently 25 year old supermodels, etc.

@_date: 2015-06-01 15:09:41
Of course.  Which is why it makes no sense to preempt it.
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:25:27
I'm sure at some point in the future it'll be possible to scale up the blockchain to include every transaction, but not today, and not in ten years.  We need to be realists about this and acknowledge that Bitcoin is primarily an independent store of value, on which transactions systems can be built.
That doesn't make it any less special and world-changing.  It still massively improves on both fiat and gold.
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:57:38
I suppose it's a careful balancing act.  You don't want to crash the price too hard, but you also don't want it soaring anytime soon.

@_date: 2015-06-09 02:34:30
I agree with this.  I'm tired of reading about this debate.  Just put the code out there and let adoption happen.  This whining is getting to be too much (on both sides).

Why be frustrated when you can just code, Gavin?  Satoshi wasn't frustrated.
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:56:44
I think the key metric for decentralization should be having full nodes in several different jurisdictions, particularly competing jurisdictions (like China, Russia, US, Brazil, India, Switzerland, Pakistan).
You don't need a billion of them, you just need a handful in places where a single government can't fuck up the entire network by taking them out.

@_date: 2015-06-18 01:23:07
It really depends on how much the banks and major payments processors invest in it.  There would need to be enormous growth in market cap and confidence in the blockchain for that to happen.  And perhaps a simultaneous collapse of confidence in traditional fiat.
In order for Bitcoin to fulfill its destiny as the internet payment protocol of choice, it must first become a huge store of value a la gold.
@_date: 2015-06-14 23:59:40
I don't think anyone working for the government would have that level of insight.  Or if they did, I doubt they'd admit it publicly.
Governments like to think they're the arbiters of truth and justice.
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:02:38
Really?  It's like $1 worth of Bitcoin per day per user.  And that's ignoring the rich users who will buy much more than that.
@_date: 2015-06-06 14:02:38

Why would transactions providers need to be approved or regulated?  Anybody could be a transactions provider.  They could be anonymous, they could serve customers in other countries, etc.  They don't even need to be businesses.  They could be DACs.
You're massively underestimating the change Bitcoin brings to the global market.
@_date: 2015-06-16 06:04:43

Maybe governments can raise money by offering quality goods and services for a cheaper price than their competitors.
@_date: 2015-06-17 14:23:43
Absolutely.  People hate to acknowledge this, though.  I think a lot of people erroneously think of third party off chain transactions providers as the equivalent of government-managed banks.
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:20:07
I think this is the most likely route.  Decentralization and automation will make collecting taxes much harder (and people will use state provides services much less).  Basically people will be able to live comfortably without being gainfully employed.

I think there's a big difference between "users" of Bitcoin and "investors" in Bitcoin.  Investors hold much more BTC total, and they hardly ever make transactions (like Satoshi himself).  Users just think it's a cool new transaction thing they can play around with, or buy contraband with.
Big difference between the two camps.

If you want to earn them via your writing, I'd recommend doing some fiction that involves Bitcoin in some way.  You'd probably receive a lot of tips for that, especially if the story is entertaining and worthwhile.

There is never a proximal cause of price action, it's just the nexus of supply and demand.  Don't be so sure it'll only go up from here.  While we are near the low of the cycle, it doesn't necessarily mean we've found the "floor" yet.

Correct.  Bitcoin will replace fiat because of marginal utility - it's more useful than fiat in many ways (while Dogecoin and Litecoin aren't more useful than Bitcoin).
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:21:25
Marginal utility.
When there are multiple goods/services all competing for the same use (in this case money), the best option beats all the others.
So think about money like it's any other good in the economy:  what makes an ideal money?  Instantly transferable anywhere in the world, very low fees to send/store it, fixed supply/zero inflation, impossible to confiscate or detect during travel, easy to measure, impossible to counterfeit, **no trust in a central authority necessary**, useful everywhere in the world, etc.
Bitcoin wins in all of these.  It beats gold, silver, digital fiat, paper fiat, etc.
So Bitcoin will eventually win in the competition between moneys.  People will gradually put more and more of their savings into it until it absorbs 100% of all fiat currencies with it.  It's like a black hole.

They aren't money printing machines.  Bitcoin doesn't have seignorage.  As the price climbs, the miners who had the foresight to invest in more chips (rather than simply mining with their existing chips) will collect a greater % of the total network.  If the price remains stagnant or falls, the opposite will happen.  Mining is speculative activity, not straightforward money printing.  So the pools will always be in flux.

I think with Bitcoin, it's only a matter of waiting, and being in the right place at the right time.  We know the US FedGov is going to suffer a huge financial catastrophe soon because of the debt.

I don't think a greenlist would be effective, anyway.  Keep in mind the BTC would still be useful in other countries, and in the black market.  Just because a government points at something and says "That's not valuable because I don't like it!" doesn't mean it's suddenly not valuable.  Arbitrage between legal jurisdictions will bring the value of those "bad" BTC back up to the same level as all the "good" BTC.
So basically this is just a statist wet dream.
@_date: 2014-09-14 07:27:46


Nah.  Even at hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, Bitcoin is still well within the range of reasonable costs (and this is with today's technology - future tech will obviously be better).
High net worth individuals won't want to put their own wealth into jeopardy by altering the network.  Individual clients will only pay attention to the blockchain that has the oldest coinbase (meaning the 21 million coin limit).
Of course using Bitcoin is always optional, and there is always the possibility of a competing currency taking its place (such as Litecoin).  The threat of competition is enough to keep miners honest.
@_date: 2014-05-29 16:13:38
I still don't see a net downward pressure.  If the dish network subscriber wants that more than BTC, he'll sell the BTC for dollars and then use the dollars to purchase network access.  This just streamlines the process and adds a big new Bitcoin player, which increases demand for BTC overall.

Look in the sidebar on this subreddit.  You'll see a link to and the Austrian economics subreddits.  Those are good places to start if you want to learn more.
You should learn about the Cantillion Effect and the Austrian business cycle theory, though.


Bingo!  This is actually how all market economies work.  Prices aren't set by the market, they are set by market participants (and you are a market participant - either via the fact you are refraining from purchasing Bitcoins, or the fact you are refraining from selling them, or the fact you are buying them).
So the price you see quoted on exchanges ($620 or whatever it is at the moment) is actually **marginal**.  Prices are set at the margin.
Think of it this way:  at any moment, there are a certain number of Bitcoins that are "on the market" (this means they're available to buy or sell).  Most people who hold Bitcoins aren't actively trading them.  They're just storing them and ignoring the price swings of the market.  So they aren't participating in setting the marginal price.  Only the currently-active batch of traders are setting the price you see.
You should really learn price theory, it will help you better understand markets.


The only way I could foresee Bitcoin collapsing is if there were a mathematical solution found to quickly cracking the Diffie Hellman public/private key cryptography, and that is a mathematical trick that's been around since the 1970's and used extensively by militaries and governments.  Mathematicians and computer scientists have been trying to crack it for decades and they haven't found a way to do it.  So I find it unlikely they'll ever be able to (at least not for the next 50 to 100 years).  Quantum computers could only speed up the brute force guessing process, so they'd cut down on the time to crack a Bitcoin address - from maybe 13 billion years to 1 billion years.
There is no reason, however, for Bitcoin to ever cease to exist, or become less popular.  It is simply better than any other money humanity has ever devised.  Fiat (both paper and digital) is now old money technology, and Bitcoin will replace it.  Just like fiat replaced gold and silver coins.
@_date: 2014-02-20 02:06:23


No, I'm just pointing out that the Bitcoin protocol is anarcho-capitalist in nature.  Many technologies are, including email (which obviates another government monopoly, on first class mail).


That's not the point.  The point is that Email obviated the government monopoly.  It took a power away from the government that it used to have, and distributed it to the people.  Email (and the internet in general), are technologies that have diminished government power in some key ways.


You're distracting from the key reason Bitcoin is anarcho-capitalist:  its censorship resistance.  Even if we had the technology to store money on our own computers prior to Bitcoin, governments still would have implemented ways to verify who we were sending the money to, freeze accounts, collect international transfer fees/taxes, and inflate the money.  Bitcoin allows people to easily overcome all these aspects of other digital currencies.
The most obvious reason Bitcoin is anarcho-capitalist?  It's a money that wasn't created by governments, and isn't backed by "legal tender laws".  That's the definition of Anarcho-Capitalism in action.
@_date: 2014-01-29 00:16:48




Correct.  Oppenheimer didn't actually drop nukes on innocent Japanese civilians - that was Paul Tibbets.


Correct.  They don't actually enforce the laws - that's the police and troops.


Prostitutes are making a voluntary trade (sex for money).  They aren't hurting anyone.  Assassins are actually killing people, while the people who hire assassins aren't.  There is a distinction.


Robbers and rapists are violating the non-aggression principle, so they're bad people.  Charlie Shrem never violated the non-aggression principle.


I'm sure Hitler killed some people personally, but the bulk of the murders that occurred in Nazi Germany were done by the troops and police.


It's amazing how you can blame people for bad things when all they did was make a trade or say some words.  There's a big difference between voluntarily trading and killing/hurting people.  There's a big difference between speaking some words and killing/hurting people.
Maybe you'll learn that one day.

When Wall Street realizes this, that's when the trillions will flow in.  Right now they still think of Bitcoin as a fad, or some kind of weird competitor to PayPal that not many people use.
Where Bitcoin truly shines isn't in payments or transfer of value across the world.  Rather, it's in the *storage* of value over long periods of time.  That's why the ultimate market cap will far exceed most prognosticators' ideas.
@_date: 2014-07-08 02:08:20
With multisig you can use Open Transactions (look that up if you haven't already - Chris Odom is doing some great work in that) to secure a set of BTC in such a way that it's in the best interest of both parties to see it eventually freed up again in the future.  Voting pools and multiple servers can then be used to verify many tens of thousands of off-chain transactions very quickly, without using many resources at all.  It's pretty neat stuff.
Bitcoin itself is just the foundation all this is built off of, and it wasn't possible to do this sort of thing before Bitcoin.

Their wealth in BTC isn't something they can access all at once without significantly affecting the price itself.
Think of it like Bill Gates, who owns a lot of shares of Microsoft.  While it's true that he's technically "worth" $70 billion, it doesn't mean he actually has that level of purchasing power.  If he were to sell all his shares of MSFT at once, he would flood the market and it would cause the price to tank 90% (because price is determined by *marginal* demand/supply nexus - the price of all the dormant BTC sitting quietly is determined by the price of the &lt;1% of BTC that are actually being traded at any given moment).
You, on the other hand, probably have a small-enough number of BTC that if you were to sell them all at once, the market wouldn't even notice.  Meaning you actually have 100% of your purchasing power.  ;)
@_date: 2014-05-30 06:57:40
Okay, the arguments are deeper than what I'll go over here, but I can give you an overview:
1.  Blockchain is interesting and valuable for some new applications, but overall it's the Bitcoin currency that's most-valuable and innovative.  Reason being:  any token on the blockchain that represents a real-world asset is automatically fraught with counterparty risk.  Keep in mind that the great innovation of Bitcoin is that it's the first digital currency that doesn't require trust in a third party.  When you "color" a Bitcoin and make it represent something (like a house, car, share of a company, etc.) you are basically taking a beautiful bird and clipping its wings.  You are introducing an added layer of risk to a token that originally didn't have that risk associated with it.  So yes, you can use the blockchain to keep track of stock ownership, deeds, titles, coupons, etc.  But it's pointless.
2.  The whole "hidden from view" argument about Bitcoin is just a side effect of the coddled society we live in today.  These days, people want to take the risk out of capitalism.  Everybody believes investing and saving should be 100% predictable, and anything that deviates from the law of averages is a terrible, sinful aberration that's only making a few people rich and punishing others.  So the goal of these puritans is to make Bitcoin vanish so that people instead own tokens that are "backed by" Bitcoin (again - clipping its wings and introducing counterparty risk).  These tokens will track the value of the dollar, thus eliminating the price action from the equation, and thus shielding the user from any gains/losses they would have if they were using Bitcoin directly.  This is idiotic and fraudulent.  The tokens aren't actually Bitcoins.  Users of this type of service are basically just giving a bunch of money up-front to a hedge fund manager to buy a ton of BTC, and then he reaps 100% of the reward from the investment while the lenders get nothing.  True, he shields them from losses.  But the losses are short-lived, relatively shallow, and somewhat predictable.  Trying to "hide" Bitcoin from people is scammy and it helps to lock people into the fiat paradigm Bitcoin was built to break them out of.
3.  Speculation is the lifeblood of the market.  We want people to be taking risks in Bitcoin, and we want the price to rise.  We want people to be "hoarding" Bitcoin, because this increases the market depth and thus the amount of value the system is capable of transferring.  Speculators and hoarders are good people, and they are providing a service to the Bitcoin economy.

No, they're not contradictory.
I'm saying that spending/selling BTC is utterly disconnected from its value as a currency and its popularity among the general public.
Basically it's like saying, "GUYS, YOU NEED TO START BUYING AND FLIPPING HOUSES SO PEOPLE HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE!"
No, people already have a place to live.  The market has already determined the value of homes, based on peoples' current preferences.  Advising everyone to spend their BTC is basically telling them to drive the price of BTC down.

Each individual has different time preferences for when he chooses to spend.  A good example of this is the tech sector: some people choose to wait a year before upgrading their HDTV because they know it will cost 30% less in the near future.  Some people choose to buy the latest and greatest smartphone, and they don't care about the high price.  As the price of bitcoin rises, hoarders will occasionally spend a portion of their wealth so they can enjoy it.
The "bitcoin=tulips" argument is flawed because tulips don't have the same useful properties bitcoin has.  This has been rebutted hundreds of times over the years.

No.  As I explained above, the barrier to entry for email was **massive**.  Fax already existed for sending documents, and you could easily call people to converse with them.  The incentive to switch to email was minimal for 99% of people.


Any buffoon can spend.  Spending isn't special or interesting.  What's special and interesting is having a money that can't be inflated, and can be sent anywhere in the world for free, without detection or permission from banks or governments.  If you want a money to spend, I suggest you look into fiat.  Bitcoin is for saving, first and foremost.


This gets into a whole can of worms about third party services, off-chain transactions, and maximum theoretical blockchain traffic.  But suffice it to say:  fiat will not survive Bitcoin.  So yes, you will get your wish.  But your wish is banal.
What's far more interesting, fascinating, useful, and game-changing is Bitcoin's effect at the macro level.

People have written on this subject extensively, and there are several reasons your post is inaccurate.  First, Bitcoin is the world's first unofficial digital currency.  Its unofficial nature opens the door to unofficial competitors in the financial services sector - this wasn't possible with gold or digital fiat.  We can now have hidden, offshore insurance, banking, stock markets, etc.
Second, Bitcoin (and the internet) is anarchism at its core.  It's a rejection of elites and their rule, and this rejection happens every time people trade fiat for Bitcoin.  Bitcoin will ultimately supersede fiat regardless of people's fears about anarchism, because it offers superior financial service at a lower price, and it isn't handicapped by regulation.
While it's true that fractional reserve banking is possible with Bitcoin, it doesn't really matter - the market will naturally determine the acceptable rate of leverage banks should be using, and individuals will ultimately have the final say as to whether they accept Bitcoin or Bitcoin-backed tokens.

The Austrian school is the only group of economists who predicted Bitcoin's success.  Math is not relevant to the study of economics except as a means to analyze past human action - it has no predictive value in the field.
Why would the price of Bitcoin crash if "no one lets it go"?  You are contradicting yourself.  And why would everyone holding Bitcoin refuse to trade it for goods and services at any price?  You seem to be forgetting that humans are individuals who have different preferences for risk, different attitudes toward time value, different goals, different temptations, etc.  Humans aren't mathematically driven automatons like Keynesians believe.

Blockchain gives us a neutral way to determine who owns what.  Bitcoins themselves don't require a third party to use.  But if you "color" a unit of bitcoin and say it represents an asset, you need a third party to enforce that backing.  The brilliance of the bitcoin protocol was to remove this third party.  So reinserting it sort of defeats the purpose.

That's because it wasn't secular deflation, which is what we're discussing here with Bitcoin.


They'll pay higher real interest rates because there's less credit available to loan out.  This is pretty common-sense.  Heck, it's the whole reason Keynesian economics exists in the first place - to infuse banks with extra credit so they lower interest rates.


Correct, in the current environment nobody would accept 10% mortgages.  But in an economy with a fixed money supply, the price of homes would be **vastly** lower than they are today, so higher interest rates on mortgages would be acceptable to most buyers.

You can ignore me, and other Anarchocapitalists.  That's fine.  But it doesn't change the fact that as Bitcoin grows and spreads, we will become richer and richer.  It doesn't change the fact that this technology obviates many government and banking services, returning them to market control.

Buying an item with Bitcoin = Buying Dollars with Bitcoin
The market is just circulating them around like a washing machine.  What drives the price higher is ultimately more **holders**.  Each hype cycle, new long-term holders join the fray.  Old long-term holders simply continue to accumulate more BTC.  It's really that simple.  The swinging price is just sparks and fireworks distracting you from this underlying hype cycle.
2014 was a great year for increasing Bitcoin's utility by getting more merchants on board.  But buying things isn't what causes the price to go higher, and eventually people will remember that and start buying BTC at higher levels again.  Then the price will bounce off the "floor" (wherever that may be), and we'll enter a new phase of panic buying.

When dealing with scum like lawyers and regulators, always:
1.  Get it in writing.  Make sure there's ZERO wiggle room for interpretation.
2.  Cover all bases and ensure the regulations only apply to large firms dealing with a high $ amount of transactions.  Don't let the regulators kill small businesses in the crib.
3.  Remind them that they're unelected.
4.  Remind them that MtGox was heavily regulated, followed TONS of KYC laws, and was made insolvent (at least initially) by regulators stepping in and confiscating their USD accounts.
5.  Remind them that their (supposed) jurisdiction is only NY, and that Bitcoin is a global phenomenon that cannot be contained or stopped by government agents.

1.  No because the currency is highly divisible, and if we ever need more units there can be a hard fork to add an extra decimal place. No big deal. 
2.  Every individual has different time preferences.  So each person will spend their bitcoin at different levels.  Deflation isn't a problem for a currency. (for instance, notice that people buy expensive smart phones today, even though they know they'll be cheaper next year)

@_date: 2014-10-08 05:00:27
Monetary sovereignty is very important, and I agree with you that it's the key to Bitcoin's value.  But I think you may be underestimating some aspects of how Bitcoin will interact with the market (and maybe Gavin is, too).
I think part of the innovation of Bitcoin is the fact that anyone can do instant and mathematically-proved audits of institutions for zero cost.  This means that businesses offering off-chain transactions will be able to compete on honesty and prove their reserves to their customers regularly.
So the transaction limitation issue isn't as big a deal as a lot of people imagine IMO.  But I also think storage and data transmission technology will progress to the point where it simply won't be an issue.
And keep in mind that even at today's prices, that $50,000 of hard drive space really isn't much.  Heck, drive up the street and you'll pass a handful of bank branches.  Each branch contains a banker who's getting paid at least $50k a year, and a couple tellers who are each getting paid $35k.
EDIT:  It's important to note that most large miners already spend more than $50k on ASICs anyway.

It's the best currency, bar none.  Today.


The majority of people are bovines.  Bitcoin is convenient, easy, and intuitive for **anybody** to use, today.  It's far easier to use than credit cards, bank accounts, or even cash.  This excuse that "it's too hard" is bogus.  People simply aren't even trying it yet.  Not trying Bitcoin != "Bitcoin is too hard to use"


What the fuck is the purpose of buying a currency only to immediately spend it??


This isn't a democracy.  Economics doesn't hinge on "the majority".  Change happens at the margin, over time.


Pure nonsense.  Look up Thier's Law.  Study it.  Learn it.


Again, average people are bovines.  The majority are bovines.  The core technology is here, and it's being used every day by a bunch of high schoolers who think they're edgy and smart.  It doesn't need improvement except in very specific ways that permit more efficient use of bandwidth and storage space.


"Demand to spend."  Say that out loud.  Then get back to me with how stupid you realize that phrase is.


It's driven by neither of these things.  It's driven by the marginal utility of the currency.  The people who bother to learn how to use Bitcoin, and who bother to **save** their money rather than go out and spend it like the rest of the bovines, will be the ones who reap the bulk of the price appreciation.
TL;DR:  Consumers are losers.  We need investors.  Bitcoin isn't a tunnel, it's the destination.
@_date: 2014-11-13 07:20:08
Bitcoins are best explained as being references to previous transaction inputs.  So if you have 5 BTC, it's actually a collection of inputs that adds up to 5.  And each of those inputs references previous transactions... and so on.  These chains of references form the "blockchain".
Naturally the question then is "Where do these Bitcoins originate?" and the answer is they are all coming from block solutions.  When a miner solves a block, he instantly broadcasts the solution throughout the network and other miners immediately start working on the solution for the block after that one.  It's like a never ending race, and everyone is trying to have the longest mathematically-correct chain.
So making the longest chain becomes a daunting task for a cheater.  In order to cheat the network, you need to solve every block faster than every other miner combined.  And honest miners always outnumber the cheaters.  This arrangement means we can trust Bitcoins and their input transactions because they reference an edifice that could only have been built by the fastest robots (ASICs).  Attacking the network would require building even faster robots and burning even more electricity - something that would cost billions of dollars.
For billions of dollars, you could shut down the entire Internet.  So Bitcoin is fairly secure.

My recommendation:  stop focusing on "average Joe".  Average Joe is never the early adopter of a new technology.  Average Joe barely has two nickels to rub together.
The growth in Bitcoin will come from business and institutional adoption first, average Joes will be last.
One more thing:  People massively overestimate the effect of mining on the price.  A 10% increase in supply doesn't cause the price to drop 70%.  It just doesn't.  There was a huge bubble in 2013, and the price never should have gone that high.

I don't store my Bitcoin with blockchain.info.  I haven't since I first started purchasing large amounts of BTC back in 2011.
Your aim here isn't protecting anyone's Bitcoin, it's bashing blockchain.info with over-the-top accusations and childish "while you were busy pumping your book" bullshit that's more akin to something people would read in TMZ than anything remotely reputable.
And, as I predicted, it turns out you **were indeed** being overly dramatic.  You could never steal anyone's BTC.
I commend you for your showmanship, however.  I guess you learned something from the guy who dragged Comcast (rightfully) over the coals.

This is a great idea.  I agree it's also a good idea to "salt" the hash, because computer programs will likely come along that try to check images for private keys on the blockchain.

Correct.  The brilliant insight of Bitcoin is twofold:  1.  The system is open to anyone who wishes to participate and 2.  Participants' self interest aligns with the system's perpetuation.

So your worry is based around a fallacy:  that Bitcoin is a consumer product (like an iPad or Hannah Montana concert tickets).  In reality, Bitcoin is a *financial product*.  So it's actually in the same category as currencies, bonds, stocks, commodities, etc.
Why would the average consumer get an email address in 1992?  They wouldn't.  None of their friends have email.  They don't own a PC (let alone a modem), and that costs $3000.  Do you know how many stamps $3000 can buy you at the post office?  What's the point of email?  Only a few professors and CEOs and nerds have it.  And if you want to talk to someone right away, just dial their phone number!
Email wasn't a consumer product (and it still isn't) - it's just a network for communication.  Very unsexy.  Hardly very useful.
By the same virtue, we can't make claims about Bitcoin's potential based on its present popularity as a spending mechanism.  Only a couple million people in the entire world currently view Bitcoin as something worth owning.  That's not shocking or damning at all.  It's natural.  Most people aren't risk takers.  And if most people *were* risk takers, would their actions really be considered risky?

@_date: 2014-11-18 02:18:16
Irreversibility of transactions is a feature, not a bug.  It means not having to trust a third party.  But if you want to trust a third party, you can still do that - systems that enable reversibility (including credit) can be built on top of Bitcoin.
So you can think of Bitcoin like a solid bedrock foundation for building a financial system on top of.  Fiat, on the other hand, is like building a skyscraper on a muddy swamp.  Eventually the ground will shift and sink, causing whatever credit and trust-based systems built on top of the central banks to have periodic collapses.  **Trust is not optional with fiat.**


Anytime victims of fraud are compensated, that money has to come from somewhere.  Usually it comes from either the printing press (which causes everybody else's money to become worth less), or it comes from insurance (which requires people to be paying into the system).
In both cases, there are trusted third parties and overhead.  Sometimes, trusted third parties may be reasonable to use.  But not everyone needs to use them with Bitcoin.  And that added flexibility gives people many more options about how to interact with each other in the market.

The purpose of ten minute blocks is to limit the number of orphaned blocks. If you have very short blocks, each block becomes less likely to "stick", so to speak, because entire batches of blocks can be substituted later by a miner doing a withholding attack. 
Don't worry about waiting for a block to confirm a transaction (unless the party you're contracting with is shady).  You can just look to see if the digital signature is valid.  That's good enough 99% of the time.

A lot of people confuse this with "society", because governments have done a good job of convincing people that peaceful interactions, roads, schools, security, etc. couldn't be possible without their territorial monopoly.
For a better understanding of the Anarchocapitalist position on this, I'd recommend checking out some of the writings by Murray Rothbard.  This is the line of thinking that led to the creation of Bitcoin itself, so it's well worth your time:

On a more serious note, this is likely the medium-term outcome of Bitcoin; people will continue to use cash to buy and sell things in their daily lives (like cups of coffee or gasoline), but they will have their long-term savings in Bitcoin.
This way the blockchain won't be overstuffed with unnecessary tiny transactions and the fiat cash will act as an anonymizing agent for acquiring/selling BTC without government being aware of which addresses you control.
@_date: 2014-10-06 20:13:49

Bitcoin, both as an open source computer program and as a social experiment, was started by anarchists.  So we don't really **care** much when someone "breaks the law".

As long as mining is profitable, people will mine. It's really that simple.  The miners themselves are incentivized to protect the value of the bitcoin network, so they will ultimately do whatever they need to to help that happen.  The number of transactions (as well as increased demand for space on the blockchain) will ensure the market strikes a good balance between hash rate, transactions per second, transactions done off-chain, bitcoin price, and average transaction fee.
Centralization of mining is an overblown concern because it overlooks the fact that there are far more variables involved than the critics acknowledge. And we see this reflected empirically: large mining pools come and go, and never attack the network itself.

The government can do whatever it wants.  It's always been able to do whatever it wants.
What it **can't** do is print BTC out of thin air, or steal/freeze Bitcoin accounts that have been properly secured.

Firstly, understand that a lot of these things are alt-coins designed as a way to get your money.  They're not necessarily scammers, they're just smart assholes who set up a "business" and sell a currency that will inevitably lose value (but not before they can cash out).
Second, it's not possible to peg the value of a digital asset to another good.  Here's a good blog post explaining why:  
The reason Bitcoin has value is precisely because it isn't pegged to anything else - it has no counterparty risk.
Third, colored coins and smart contracts are actually useful.  But there are ways to do them that don't involve new currencies and unnecessary blockchains.  Open Transactions by Chris Odom is a great example of this.  It's the real deal.  Mastercoin and Ethereum, on the other hand, aren't.
The great thing about colored coins, smart contracts, etc. is that it's possible to make digital representations of contracts that have the same sort of properties as Bitcoin.  But remember that any time you have a contract, you have counterparty risk.  So this is all contingent on people not breaking their promises to honor the contract.
None of these things can help with exchanging actual dollars to bitcoins.  That's a myth.  You'll always need face-to-face cash transactions, or bank-connected exchanges for that.  Sorry!  :(

Oh yeah, there are already lotteries in Bitcoin.  But they'll become more popular and get bigger once Bitcoin grows its userbase further.

Tired old arguments.
Firstly, it's not clear Bitcoin violates the regression theorem - there is value to networks.
Secondly, it's not clear the regression theorem is applicable in all cases.  Money is first and foremost a *network*, and only secondarily a commodity.  Commodities simply served as a good proxy for a network prior to the advent of the Internet.

Bitcoins are literally chains of references to previous transaction outputs.  These chains of references span multiple blocks in the blockchain, and every Bitcoin originates in a block reward (what a miner gets for solving a block hash first).  So you can think of it like in school, when a math teacher tells students to "show your work".  Each Bitcoin must be traceable to its original block, and each block is mathematically unique and impossible to replace (kind of like a piece in a puzzle).  Cheating this system would require more computational power than humans will ever have access to.

Miners can already fork the blockchain and make their own version of Bitcoin that has any features they want it to have (such as higher inflation or whatever).

@_date: 2014-07-13 06:42:59

This is unlikely, but remotely possible.  I think it's far more likely Bitcoin is from Wei Dai or Nick Szabo - perhaps both working in collaboration.
Bitcoin causes far more problems for governments than it solves, and Anarcho-Capitalists (of the crypto variety, at least) have known what a game changing technology it would be for a very long time now.

Only if the network isn't servicing tens of thousands of transactions per block by the time the mining reward is negligible.  I don't see any reason to think this wouldn't be the case - it's many years away.  The network effect here is a lot stronger than the effect of the reduced mining reward.

Not exactly.  Keep in mind there are always Bitcoin holders who maintain their position and refuse to sell regardless of how low the price goes.  As long as the network continues to function and the fundamentals remain the same, they'll hold.  And more and more of these people latch onto Bitcoin each month, week, day.

Have you never heard of FOREX?


Again:  have you never heard of FOREX?


This statement proves you don't understand the basics of economics.  If dollars are *always* more valuable than anything I could possibly buy with them, then I would starve to death after selling all my assets.  It simply makes no sense.
There is an equilibrium point where people begin to trade their dollars (or whatever currency) for goods and services.  You appear to be denying that.


Well the problem is you'd be disagreeing with empirical reality - the massive success of Bitcoin is proof that deflationary currency is very popular with both retailers and individuals.
And not only that, people often *divest* their Bitcoin holdings (rather than only hoard them, as you claimed they would).


It doesn't matter whether the currency goes up or down in value in the short-term, as long as it maintains its value (or gains value) in the longer term.  Currencies that lose value in the long term simply can't compete with a currency that is naturally deflationary.  Bitcoin is proving this.

Mycelium servers don't store your private keys, they're encrypted and stored on your phone.  It's a very secure, open source app, so I trust it with a few hundred dollars' worth of BTC at a time.  Anything in excess of that, I'll send to my paper wallets for safety.
Mycelium does rely on central servers to broadcast your transactions and receive updated information about the addresses you control, but that's nothing to worry about.  If the servers explode, your private keys are still on your phone.  And you can make backups of them so if your phone falls in a lake, you'll be able to import them on your new phone.

The basics of Bitcoin are actually very simple.  What gets confusing is trying to understand exactly *how* Bitcoin works (just like understanding the details of how a graphics card works, or anything else technical).
So on the surface, Bitcoin is just internet money that you can move around between addresses (which look like a long jumble of numbers and letters).  The key advantages this provides over credit cards and PayPal are:
1.  It cuts out the middle-man, so you don't need to pay high fees to anyone.
2.  It eliminates the need to "register" or "sign up" - anybody can receive and send this money to anyone else in any country at any time, and they don't need an email address or personal identifying information.
3.  Sending money is much faster than with a credit card (and more secure if you're a merchant because people can't defraud you by executing a "charge back").
The other advantages of Bitcoin, which are slightly more abstract and political:
4.  It eliminates the need for trusted third parties (TTPs), which is a major innovation in money - probably the biggest since the invention of double entry bookkeeping in the 14th century.
5.  It makes sending large amounts of money internationally fast and cheap (or you can pass through an airport checkpoint with tens of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin in your head, memorized as a passphrase).  It's quite James Bond.
6.  It's impossible for governments to confiscate, freeze, tax, **inflate**, or even know who owns certain BTC.  (It is however possible for them to get your private keys if you leave them unsecured, and the process of securing them is slightly advanced - but it's easy once you know how).
7.  It eliminates the need for multiple currencies (which really only exist due to legal tender laws enacted by governments).  Bitcoin will eventually subsume all fiat currencies, and it will be used globally.
Welcome aboard.

5.  Lightweight
6.  Durable
7.  Easy and cheap to secure from thieves
8.  Easy to identify
9.  Homogeneous 
10.  Easily (and very) divisible
11.  Doesn't require trust in a central authority or government
Now tell me how many things you can think of that fit those properties I've listed?

If there's a clever method for cracking the crypto Bitcoin is based on, the world will have **much** bigger problems than Bitcoin failing.  Nearly all major financial institutions, militaries, and websites use crypto that is identical or similar.
I find this unlikely to happen anytime soon (or at all) given the fact the basis for this cryptography has been public since the 1970's and it's still pretty sturdy.
@_date: 2014-10-14 21:24:12
Yeah I actually think this would be the most likely outcome.  Someone would only use it in a few select cases on addresses containing large amounts of BTC.  Also I doubt there could be a mathematical "crack" for this type of encryption that yields instant results.  It would probably just knock down the total processing power necessary to crack a single address's key by a few orders of magnitude.  But the processing power and time necessary to do it would still be considerable.

Well in the past they were tougher, but with technology today it's getting easier, especially after the Snowden revelations.
Even if the government is aware of my total BTC holdings, they will be in for a rude surprise if they approach me in person - it is possible to code a "dead man's switch" that can immediately expunge my addresses by sending the BTC to addresses controlled by other parties.  In this case, I would send my money to fellow anarcho-capitalists scattered across the globe.

In my view, all fiat is mutually exclusive with Bitcoin.
There is a competition between the two types of currencies, and the marginal utility of one (Bitcoin) will cause the other (fiat) to lose value over time.  All fiat currencies collapse eventually, and their average life expectancy is roughly 27 years.
Bitcoin is fundamentally more-trustworthy and better than fiat, so I don't think people will compromise and store some value in the old money.

Doesn't work. Mining basically always boils down to money.  "How much money are you willing to sacrifice in order to participate in a raffle for more units of this currency?" You can make mining as complex as you want to, but in the end it's just money. 
The good news is we don't need to worry about a 51% attack because of the alignment of incentives. ASICs are a "sunk cost", so they are only valuable if the bitcoin network is healthy. Therefore owners and operators of ASICs will want bitcoin to remain valuable.

He's ignoring the fact that miners' fees will increase (when necessary) and that will naturally push more off-chain transactions.  The off-chain transactions can be conducted in ways that don't rely on a single trusted third party (look into Chris Odom's Open Transactions project).  With OT, you can use voting pools and multisig to secure BTC in a way that doesn't require trust, while creating an incentive to ensure bitcoin-backed tokens are honored.
Even at the level of VISA Black Friday, nodes and miners can get away with using a basic T1 internet connection.  But from an economic standpoint, it's really not a big deal that every little transaction is on the blockchain.  The big deal is that settlements are honored.  Bitcoin makes honoring settlements 10x easier (and cheaper) than with gold.  So even with 99% of transactions happening off the blockchain (and the occasional fraudster issuing fake tokens), you'd still end up with a global economy that's much more trustworthy than any fiat system that exists today.

These same arguments were just as applicable when bitcoin was $2 as today. The market values the bitcoin network, whether you wish it to or not. It values the elimination of trusted third parties (which isn't to say services can't be built on top of bitcoin).  It values the ease of receivership.  It values the ease of international transfer.

Well think about the root of that word, "capitalism".  In order to have capitalism, you need capital.  In order to have capital, you must have savings.  In order to have savings, you must have *deferred consumption*.
It's similar to the reason Bitcoin (or any other currency) has value - people refuse to sell/trade it for other stuff at the current asking price.  This refusal to participate in a trade is what keeps its price afloat.
The same is true with capital, generally.  In order for it to have value, it must be scarce.  People have to refuse to loan it out.
The two extremes almost never exist in reality:  that nobody is loaning or selling capital, or that everybody is loaning and selling capital.  There's always a balance, and the market determines that.
If most Bitcoins are "just sitting around in wallets and devices", this isn't a big deal because it just makes the circulating Bitcoins that much more valuable!

Bitcoin works in two ways:
1.  Decentralizes the confirmation of transactions (this is important because the blockchain ensures everybody agrees on the **order** transactions took place - if people disagree about the order, then you can potentially spend your BTC multiple times, which basically makes the currency worthless).  There's a good video on it here:  
2.  Keeps the participants honest by making mining lucrative.  So in order to participate in the Bitcoin network as a miner (and have an influence on the blockchain), you need to go out and buy ASICs computer chips and pump a ton of electricity through them.  This isn't cheap to do.  And if the price of Bitcoin crashes, the value of your ASICs crash too.  So the network is designed to financially incentivize miners to keep Bitcoin honest.  Miners want the price of Bitcoin to go up.
A 51% attack is where a majority of the processing power is directed to a "dishonest chain".  Basically the blockchain is forked (so there are two blockchains instead of one), and the majority of the processing power is being used to create a counterfeit chain where the miner is capable of 'double spending' his Bitcoins.
In this scenario, the miner still can't spend other peoples' Bitcoins (because he doesn't have their private keys), but he can prevent them from spending their Bitcoin by simply refusing to include those transactions in the counterfeit blockchain.
A 51% attack isn't nearly as catastrophic as people make it out to be, because the individual network nodes will eventually just ignore the counterfeit chain and wait for block confirmations on the original blockchain.  It will take longer, and it will be annoying, but the old chain will continue.

You're a bit confused, which is understandable because a lot of Bitcoin's critics aren't well-versed in economics.
A Bitcoin transaction doesn't cost $25-30.  That's a fallacy.  You're assuming the network is *only* used for moving money, when in fact it's primarily being used to store money.  The market values the storage aspect much more than the transfer aspect, and always will.

Yeah, the volatility definitely doesn't help in situations like this.  Austrians still expect bitcoin to "catch on" over time though, because the marginal utility associated with the fixed supply and other positive aspects of the currency will pull value away from fiat over time.  Speculators make this happen, not day to day users (although they contribute a lot of the underlying demand).
@_date: 2014-06-15 20:26:42

@_date: 2014-06-02 20:46:25
Yeah, a lot of people have this fear, and I think it's unfounded.
Keep in mind that Bitcoin can be quickly and easily transferred, divvied up, assayed, and audited.  These qualities make it ideal for saving (unlike gold).
I imagine what will happen is that banks and businesses like Circle/Coinbase/BitPay will have periodic "proof of reserves" where they show beyond a shadow of a doubt that they actually have the BTC to back the digital tokens they issue.  Analysts will keep the public up to date, letting us know if they use leverage or fractional reserve.  The market will adjust accordingly, factoring risk into the value of the tokens.
Basically your day-to-day expenses will be done in these tokens while your long-term savings and international transfers will be done in BTC.  If people want to take risks with tokens, that's their right.  But many will be burned, and they'll come scurrying back to real BTC and higher-quality banks.

Well I suppose you could make the same argument for all wealth - why don't billionaires limit themselves to spending just $100 a day?  After all, if they put their money in investments, it would grow so much!
The reason is:  wealthy people prefer enjoying their wealth before they're old or dead.  It's something called **time preference**, and it's where interest rates come from.  People prefer to spend money now, rather than later.

Yeah it's most likely multisig will become a common solution for addresses that hold a large amount of BTC.  That will make threats of violence impractical.
The more interesting question is how governments will deal with this fact when multisig users are dispersed internationally?  For instance, let's say a government chooses to tax someone in Country A, but that address belongs to someone who requires signatures from citizens in Countries B, C, D, and E.
Barring invasion of the other countries, the government can't get around the fact that the other key holders act as an effective deterrent to attempts at taxation / harassment.

Not to be a Debbie Downer (because I know how abused noobs are in this subreddit), but you're wrong.
Having multiple proofs of work doesn't change the simple fact that mining is nothing more than a "brute force" operation that always boils down to access to cheap electricity and tons of computer chips.  Even in the case where there are multiple algorithms, people would just manufacture the other ASICs and bundle them together for Bitcoin mining.
**The good news is, it doesn't matter.**  Check out my post here:  
Just because you have more than 50% of the network's hash rate, doesn't mean you can start generating fake transactions (because you don't have the private keys of all the Bitcoin addresses).  It just means you can generate **empty blocks** (ie shut down all transactions on the network).  If this happens, the individual Bitcoin nodes can simply be programmed to ignore empty blocks and only accept blocks that have a reasonable number of transactions in them.
A 51% attack really isn't as big of a deal as people make it out to be.

Right, most bitcoins are just long chains of references to previous input transactions.  If you go back far enough in the blockchain, you get to the specific block where they were rewarded to the miner for solving the hash.  This is called "proof of work", and it's kind of like when your math teacher demands that you show all the steps you took to solve a problem.  It makes cheating impossible.

While my numbers may be off in real terms, I think it's still a fair apples-to-apples comparison since last year because I used the same metric to calculate the value of each transaction (averaged to 1 BTC per transaction, which obviously isn't the case - the value of the avg transaction changes over time and I'm not sure where you'd go to get that number).
I think what this shows is a combination of things:  1.  Assuming the graph linked to is right, we see a 2.5x increase in USD throughput since June of last year (which is nothing to shake a stick at!)  2.  Extrapolating this 2.5x increase to the USD price means Bitcoin is currently fairly valued (at least based on the June price of last year).  Of course, this says nothing of the holders of BTC who simply don't make many transactions.  They may contribute a certain % of padding to the price by refusing to sell.

Wealth is created when capital is accumulated and used to generate greater productivity.  So in order to make society richer, you first need to save money.  Saving means deferring gratification.  You take your savings and use it to build a factory (or get an education in a particular field, or spend time tinkering with ideas in your garage, etc.)  This is the entrepreneurial process.  Entrepreneurs use capital (their own, and other people's savings), combined with knowledge and risk, to make a new product/service.  These new products/services are then set before customers, and there is a kind of scientific process occurring where customers may or may not choose to buy them.  This process is successful if the entrepreneur can turn a profit.  If not, the losses are a signal to the entrepreneur to use their scarce resources in a different way, and to stop wasting money.
Without Bitcoin, the game is rigged.  Money flows to special interests and the politically well-connected.  Money is taxed at every turn, and it fills the pockets of the elite who don't actually earn it.  The elite also print more money for themselves and their friends via central banks.  All this has the effect of limiting the amount of capital entrepreneurs have available at their disposal.  Overall, society is geared toward spending (consuming) rather than saving.

The difference is that Bitcoin makes it far easier to conceal income, because earlier adopters got the majority of their BTC from mining rather than purchasing them on open exchanges.  Governments will learn this the hard way, especially as Bitcoin spreads away from exchanges and people start to use it in lieu of cash.


Correct, because they aren't "points" per se - they are credits.  They are backed by a corporation based in the US.  Bitcoin's value floats on the market, and it isn't issued in a single jurisdiction or by a single entity.  It is a unique **point** system (not a credit system).
For that reason, the IRS needed to categorize it for tax purposes.  Prior to their categorization, Bitcoin wasn't obviously property, and thus a strong case can be made that peoples' behavior toward it would have been substantially different had they known for certain how the IRS would view it.  This is a retroactive ruling.

I pay taxes when it's more expensive to escape them than it is to pay them.  Unfortunately for governments, it is more expensive to collect taxes in BTC than it is to go out and earn the BTC via voluntary trade in the market.
So yeah, the state wasn't fucking around with gold and paper and their endless digital confetti.  But that's only because they could use force and counterfeiting in those cases.  Bitcoin shifts the equation so that over the longer term, costs are concentrated and benefits are dispersed - the opposite of fiat.

I assure you I'd never champion the modern republican political party - I myself am an anarchocapitalist.  Republicans are fascist in their own ways, and democrats in theirs.  But I think the voters themselves (rather than the politicians) tend to have very different ideas about how society should be run, and which issues are important.  Conservative voters have been much more concerned with eliminating central banking, or at least exposing it to competition.  Progressives view central banking as a tool for government to finance itself, rather than an enemy of prosperity.

Yes, actually!  The government has a monopoly on sending first class letters and mail in the US, and they consistently raise their stamp prices - email saved a lot of people a TON of money by getting around this particular government monopoly (which was actually one written in the US Constitution).


We already had digital money prior to Bitcoin.  Digital fiat has existed since the late 1970's or so.  The key distinction is that Bitcoin is independent from government, and allows people to bypass government restrictions and regulations.


Were you able to do those things before the Internet existed?  Nope.  Why not?  Because the government regulations disallowed you from broadcasting your own radio show.  The government regulations disallowed you from starting your own bank, or transferring money anywhere in the world to anyone.
You're basically in denial that Bitcoin is valuable because it allows you to bypass government edicts - you're trying to claim you like it because of the fact it's digital, when digital money has existed for literally decades now.

And yet... no large mining pool has attacked the network.  Mining has become less centralized with time.  Economic incentives make attacks incredibly unlikely and expensive.

Right, but this would require a hard fork and a massive shift in public opinion about the dilution of money.  You're kidding yourself if you think the will to inflate is that widespread or that strong.
Of course, there are alt-coins that can accommodate inflation (such as Dogecoin).  So the argument for hard-forking Bitcoin would be weak on its face - if a majority of people wanted inflation, they could just sell their BTC and move to Doge or another alt that better accommodates them.
I view this as sort of a desperate last-ditch attempt to save the legacy of central banking and Keynesian economics.  It's interesting sociologically, but no longer relevant.  But I guess it's fun to daydream.

How much money does it take to run a branch of Wells Fargo?  There are 2 tellers, 2 bankers.  The tellers make approx $30,000 a year.  The bankers make approx $70,000 a year.  That's $200,000 a year for a single branch of Wells Fargo (doesn't include the electricity, the mortgage on the building &amp; vault, etc.)
There are thousands and thousands of bank branches just like these, scattered all over the US and EU.
How much storage space could you currently buy with $200,000 a year?  A 2 TB hard drive costs approx $100 (when you're not buying in bulk).  So you could buy 2000 2TB hard drives for a total of 4000 terabytes a year in blockchain storage.  And that's just for one bank branch.  Go drive down the street in any suburban / city area.  You'll see multiple branches in every direction.

"Mining is profitable, therefore a single mining company will have all the money and use it to outpace every other potential miner."
There are a few flaws with this argument.  1.  Mining isn't profitable most of the time, for anyone.  And if it is, it's only barely profitable.  2.  There are other ways to make money faster and cheaper than via mining.  Participating in securing the network isn't something done by the richest bitcoiners, even.  3.

Do a Google search for "Satoshi Nakamoto Institute" and you can read more on the subject of money and Bitcoin.   Money isn't a "thing", it's just a way to keep track of who owes what to whom.  Before the internet, the best way to do mass recordkeeping was to use a token (gold or silver were good for this).  Now that we have cheap high speed internet and huge hard drives, the process of bookkeeping becomes super cheap and distributed.  So bitcoin is a very natural and predictable evolutionary step for money, if you understand what money actually is. The short term price action is obscuring the larger trend:  away from centralized inflating currency and into decentralized fixed supply currency.

@_date: 2014-06-09 04:15:38


Well they could use an alt-coin, assuming one has widespread acceptance.


Well it's not fractional reserve.  As I pointed out, it's possible for banks/businesses to prove to their customers they have BTC set aside to back the tokens they issue.  I suppose if a bank wanted to do fractional reserve, they could.  But their customers would immediately see what was happening and you'd have organizations like Consumer Report ranking banks based on this behavior.  It boils down to how much risk people are willing to take, in order to achieve a higher interest rate on their savings.  Keep in mind also that these tokens wouldn't be considered tantamount to Bitcoins for all intents and purposes.  They would be valued based on the trustworthiness of the backing institution and their proof-of-reserves.
But I don't really think this will be a huge issue in the next 10 years.  Computer technology is improving fast enough that the transaction fees on BTC should never be particularly high.

This is simply false.  Millions of young Americans have friends in other countries that they talk to almost daily on Facebook and using other apps.  The Internet has created a generation of very cosmopolitan people.  People who like to travel, send money to friends and family, etc.
Even for sending money to people up the street, Bitcoin is easier than traditional banks.


But "the majority" don't decide what currency becomes valuable and widespread.  Markets are not a democracy.  They are driven by marginal utility.

During a financial crisis, people move into assets that preserve and protect their wealth.  They do this naturally anyway (notice that few people save for retirement simply by accumulating cash - instead they hoard stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, etc.).
Bitcoin is the first digital currency without counterparty risk.  So it's similar to gold in that regard.  Yes, it's possible for someone to steal it.  Just like it's possible for someone to snatch your gold.  But these thefts aren't systemic in the same way inflation is.  You'll notice also that gold isn't widely accepted by merchants while bitcoin is.  So this makes bitcoin the best digital currency for the preservation of wealth (over the longer term).  Short term traders sometimes drive down the price, obviously.

It's valid because he's claiming spending this much is necessary for new forum software.  If that's the case, there's no way the original donations could have been earmarked for this purpose, because they didn't come close to being enough to pay for entirely new forum software.

Explain to him that "pegging" is just a promise - it's not real.  The word "peg" is misleading because it sounds like something you do with two physical objects.  The peg between money and the commodity backing it doesn't exist in the physical world, though.  So pegs are often broken by dishonest governments and banks.  The only thing that can maintain a peg is accountability to customers, and that's difficult in a fiat environment where we are forced to use the money to pay our taxes.
Bitcoin is "backed" by its usefulness.  Just like a computer is valuable because of the things it can allow you to accomplish - it's useful to meet certain ends.  Bitcoin is useful to meet certain ends that fiat currencies can't meet.  Therefore the network (and by extension the currency) is valuable.  The only way one can participate in the Bitcoin network is by purchasing Bitcoins themselves.
Bitcoin is regulated by the participants in the network, and most of this regulation is done automatically by computers (the process of mining and adding blocks to the end of the long chain).  In order for your father to better understand Bitcoin, he needs to understand that "a Bitcoin" doesn't exist as a discrete unit - all Bitcoins are just references to previous transactions.  So the blockchain itself is the Bitcoins, and the Bitcoins are the blockchain.  There's a good video on it here:  
Essentially Bitcoin is a giant ledger keeping track of peoples' "tokens" in an open and decentralized way.  This wasn't possible before 2009 because the technology to pull off this feat simply didn't exist.  Individual banks could keep track of dollars using their computers, but they couldn't do it in a trustworthy, decentralized way.  Now we can.
If your father wants a more in-depth understanding of the origin of Bitcoin's value (and the origin of the value of all money), I would recommend he check out these two things:
@_date: 2014-05-07 16:43:09

The majority will never want inflation of their money. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 16:30:32
He also ignores the fact that mining itself is a speculative endeavor.  For instance, if you expect Bitcoin to increase in value in the near future, it's in your best interest to cease mining with your existing ASICs and use that electricity money to invest in more infrastructure (which you will then turn on as the price shoots up).  The same kind of deferral is common among people who aren't yet mining and looking to get a leg up over existing miners - why burn up electricity now when you can seize a greater share of the total hash rate later?  Let the established miners run their chips into the ground.

Miners aren't subsidized by inflation because they spend just as much money on ASICs and electricity as they get back in the form of block rewards. 
VCs only invest in companies they believe will be profitable in the long run, or already show consistent cash flow. 
Bitcoin doesn't need many nodes, and it's cheap and easy to set them up.  Furthermore, it's easy for miners themselves to finance the creation and operation of more nodes through bitcoin payments. 
These things are all very sustainable, and become more sustainable as the system grows and technology progresses.

Yep, Bitcoins are basically stored in a "cloud", but it's a bit more complex than that.  When you have money in a traditional bank, that money is stored digitally on the bank's hard drives.  You trust the bank to not screw up and delete your money or give it to someone else.  Bitcoin eliminates this trust by decentralizing the process of storing and updating the books.  So instead of one bank, there are tens of thousands of "miners" and "nodes" that are all keeping copies of the "blockchain".  They are constantly verifying the contents, ensuring nobody can cheat.  The whole process is an amazing computer science innovation that's never been done before Bitcoin came along, and you can learn more about it in this vid:  
I would recommend you invest more.  I do expect the price of Bitcoin to continue to rise, as more people discover how useful it is.  And there are economic reasons for this, but I won't confuse you with them (unless you're also interested in that).  As with any investment, make sure you're diversified.  Don't put all your eggs in one basket!  And understand Bitcoin better before you dive into it.

It's really astonishing seeing these educated people fundamentally misunderstanding what they're up against.  They think they are capable of stabilizing the value of their fiat currencies, when the stability comes from the market itself.  Central banks can't control markets in the long term, just in the short term.  And even then, their control is temporary and traders are licking their chops waiting for it to break.

1.  Buy through Coinbase since you're already using that.

Naturally, but how do you think banks would feel about this?  People would be fleeing banks to the greener pastures of BitDollars.


You misunderstand what causes stability in a currency.  Stability comes from an equilibrium of demand and supply (ie market saturation).  Bitcoin hasn't yet reached market saturation, so it isn't stable yet.  Given a choice between two types of money - inflationary and fixed supply - people will naturally always choose the fixed supply money.  People prefer money that gains value over time, rather than loses value.

You can't prove that someone controls an address they've sent BTC to.  It's not possible.  You can theorize they control it.  You could accuse them of controlling it.  You could pound your fist on the table and scream that they control those BTC.
But you can't prove it.  :(  Sorry baby doll.

No, because there wouldn't be a lack of investment capital.  Rich people would still be interested in getting richer, so they would be in search of new investment opportunities all the time.
Entrepreneurs who need investment to start their businesses would still be in competition for the same scarce resources.  The total size of the pool of money they have access to doesn't matter, because they will just bid-up the prices of the factors of production until they get them.

I think the main reason some people think is "rude" isn't because we are actually rude, but simply because we disagree on some key issues and we aren't afraid to debate them on it.
Those issues:
1.  Deflation and hoarding - is it bad?
2.  Taxation and government control - is it bad?
3.  Centralization - is it bad?
4.  Is Bitcoin political?  Or is it neutral?
5.  Silk Road and buying drugs/guns online - is this unethical?  Is Ross Ulbricht a bad person?
6.  Are libertarians retarded, greedy, rich, straight white males?  Is Rachel Maddow a goddess sent to warn us about the Koch Brothers' destructive plans??
7.  Are the early adopters of Bitcoin unfairly rich?
8.  Do protocols like Mastercoin, Etherium, etc. actually contribute anything, or are they just examples of developers searching for some easy money?
Naturally there are a lot of places where schisms can happen, so the subreddit is considered "bitter" and "rude".  But the truth of the matter is, money is serious business.  It's not a thing you want to play around with.  That doesn't engender confidence.

Sure, but there's no law saying I must accept a certain ratio of USD to goods/services.  I can jack that ratio as high as I want for USD, while lowering it for a fixed-supply currency like Bitcoin.  And we already see this happening, as the price of Bitcoin (as measured in dollars) rises over time.

Don't fall for the myth that history is a story of "progress".  It's not, except technologically.  There were societies prior to our own that were more socially liberal, less intrusive of peoples' privacy, less prone to war, had less inflationary currency, less corruption, less graft, etc.  Society could easily revert.

There is a massive, massive difference between inflation and mining.  No economist or trader in his right mind will claim that gold is "inflationary".  In fact, gold is considered a hedge against inflation.  But it is **mined**.  The distinction is important, because inflation involves [seigniorage]( while mining Bitcoin &amp; gold does not.


As Marc Andreesen (and others) have pointed out numerous times, VC investment in tech is actually rather modest right now, contrary to popular belief.  There is not a tech bubble now.  At all.  And yes, VCs don't invest unless they see serious potential for serious returns.  Just look up online how difficult it is to get VC funding if you don't believe me. Andreesen Horowitz is the most respected VC firm in the world (or among the most).  They aren't some two timing podunk firm.


I shouldn't have to explain to you that miners wouldn't shoot themselves in the foot like this.  This is grade school stuff.  Bill Gates won't bomb Microsoft's headquarters and miners won't bomb Bitcoin's integrity and usefulness.  And running a node will always be cheaper than running a bank branch - hands down.  There are thousands of bank branches scattered all across America.  The efficiency Bitcoin offers over this structure is massive.


Are you claiming that technology won't continue to improve in the future?  Come on.

We don't know exactly when the "saturation point" will be reached, but it's possible to speculate.
If we look at gold as an investible asset, we see the entire commodity has a value somewhere between $5 and $10 Trillion.  I think gold is a good analogy for Bitcoin because it is a monetary commodity and used globally to settle international debts.
Bitcoin is likely to surpass gold simply by virtue of being more useful.  My conservative estimate for the medium term value of Bitcoin (in the next 10 years) is $2 Trillion market cap.  This is barring any catastrophic attack on the network, of course.

Wouldn't ASICs hit a theoretical efficiency limit?  There are better ways to make money than mining.  If some miners abuse their power, or governments capture them, we can easily abandon Bitcoin for another digital currency that offers more freedom.  I don't think governments will be able to collaborate on this as well as you might expect.
@_date: 2014-12-14 23:41:06

What they all fail to acknowledge is that mining is a speculative operation, not a guaranteed return on capital.  For instance:  some miners will act on the belief the price is about to rise, while others will act like it's about to fall.  Some will hoard BTC and ASICs for future sale and deployment, while others will spend BTC on electricity and run their existing infrastructure without building up more hash power.

The transition away from fiat will be bumpy, but it's inevitable.  Bitcoin is fixed supply and global, so it has inherent advantages over fiat. The volatility will, over time, end up helping bitcoin adopters more than it hurts them (via price appreciation).  So as long as the number of users is climbing (and it always is), the price will climb on average.  The climbing price then has the effect of attracting more new users.  And each crash matters less psychologically because people know all the previous crashes ended up not killing the network.

Here's a slightly more respectable tip for you.  $1 @_date: 2014-03-15 21:29:13
Your fears are intuitive, but much of economics is counterintuitive.  Just because there's a lot of capital available for businesses and individuals to borrow, doesn't mean that society is richer or more productive.  It just means there's more capital sloshing around.
Entrepreneurs are in competition with one another for this capital.  More capital doesn't mean there are more entrepreneurs, it just means the same people are vying for the bigger pool of money.  **But prices are ratios.**  So when there are less dollars available to borrow, each dollar becomes worth more.
In other words, the current system (with fractional reserve banking, inflation, tons of liquidity and capital) isn't actually doing anything to increase productivity and startups.  It's a mirage.
In a Bitcoin world, you would see a lot of loans being made that otherwise wouldn't be made - for instance, people in China could give loans to businesses in Brazil or Tunisia.  And they could do this without middle men!
@_date: 2014-05-11 03:03:50
Very good adoption.  You'd see it traded for cash and goods/services.
What's funny is, if the government bans the purchase of BTC via banks, they'd actually be shooting themselves in the foot.  Because at least with banks, they'd be able to see who owned which BTC at the start.  With cash and goods on OpenBazaar... they're shit out of luck.

I'm sure "actual usage" has increased, but I agree it's not as dramatic as the transaction data indicate.

Ehhh, not exactly.  Forex traders are very familiar with the short term fluctuations of fiat currencies, which can sometimes increase in value against other assets and currencies.
Some people keep a sizable portion of their savings as dollars simply because they believe the rate of interest they receive on them will exceed inflation (and it sometimes does).


Sometimes.  This has more to do with the laws surrounding buying/selling cars.  But cars are useful for specific purposes, and new cars are generally a luxury compared to used ones (which don't lose a lot of value when they are bought and sold).
Similarly, Bitcoin is useful for specific purposes.  It's a tool.

Currencies are in competition with one another.  If you can dream up a theoretical crypto currency that is better than Bitcoin, tell us all about it.  But frankly I don't even see a need for one.  Bitcoin is satisfactory.  Its only real competition is fiat, which is outdated money technology.

Correct.  And horses used to be the world's primary mode of transportation.


True, being digital doesn't make a currency good all on its own.  However, Bitcoin combines digital with limited supply (like commodities).  It's the best of both worlds.


This is true, but it's actually a bad thing.  People would prefer to have a currency that gains value over time (due to being limited in supply) than a currency that loses value over time.  Naturally inflationary currencies will require less and less divisibility as time marches forward.
@_date: 2014-11-22 07:19:19
It wouldn't necessarily.  Nor would it necessarily go up.  The price action happens over time.  It's smudged out like wet paint.  Same with the hash rate leading up to that moment.

The word-of-mouth is enough, and will be enough.  Don't worry.  As long as Bitcoin "goes up more than it goes down" on average, people will want to buy it and take the risk.

Depends on how small the transaction is.  Larger amounts of money are processed quickly irrespective of whether they have a fee attached.  Anything that's not a huge amount doesn't require that you wait for confirmations (unless you're paranoid someone will buy several billion dollars worth of ASICs and electricity to steal your $37 of BTC).

I'd recommend MultiBit as your Mac wallet, but others here might recommend something else.  Whatever you choose, make sure you have antivirus.  Also make sure you have a backup of the private keys (some wallet software will create a "deterministic" wallet which means your backup will be a list of 12 random words - write it down on paper and store a copy in two separate locations).
If you have an android phone, I'd recommend Mycelium.

This is an unfounded claim, and precisely what my post was trying to dispel.

Simple answer:  the world's first and most widely used trustworthy online money.  You can buy it on  with a credit card or  with a bank account.
More complex answer:  it's a giant ledger (block chain) that is continually growing.  Verification of the chain is decentralized via a mathematical race, so it's impossible for any one person or group of people to falsify the data.  This is a major technological innovation that opens up some astounding possibilities.  We don't need central banks anymore.  Bitcoin eliminates the need for trusted third parties in financial transactions.

Actually it's been a great indicator.  It has shown adoption increasing.  Price overreacts - it's why Bitcoin went to $1132 back in December.  But if you look at the price history of Bitcoin, this particular correction is perfectly reasonable.  It still represents a 4x increase in the price from last year, which is blazing fast growth for any commodity/stock/bond/currency/etc.

No, I don't think they have a moral obligation to help others because they've already done that - in a free market, all earnings are due to people making trades with others that have benefited society (via "consumer surplus").
So wealthy people aren't withholding stuff from society.  Just because a billionaire has that money sitting in a bank (or Bitcoin) doesn't mean that he's keeping real goods and services from the rest of us.  Those real goods and services still exist, and still get traded.  They're just being used in different ways than if they billionaire tapped them.  Understand?
The best way to help struggling people is to increase society's productive capacity.  That means making more cars, homes, HDTVs, washing machines, computers, etc.  Productivity is increased by the efficient allocation of capital.  Efficiency is increased by profit (profit and loss are signals, telling businesses what to invest in and what to abandon).

Anarchocapitalists have been talking about and working on cryptocurrencies for the last 25 years.  You can't change history.  Satoshi made it clear that he wanted money power pried from the hands of trust-based, centralized institutions.  He even included a headline to that effect in the genesis block.

Right, because they reach a saturation point where there is no longer marginal utility.  Bitcoin doesn't have the same marginal utility problem.  Its growth is a positive feedback loop, because as the price goes higher (and more people use it), the network is more-valuable and that incentivizes greater adoption and more buying.

Demand for Bitcoins is the basis for the Bitcoin ecosystem, and the limited supply sets is apart from all other digital currencies.  Speculation that the market craves those qualities in a currency are what gives Bitcoin its value.  So there's absolutely nothing wrong with hoarding BTC and wanting (even expecting) to get rich from it.  As long as you're being somewhat prudent about it and not putting all your eggs in one basket.

No, there is not shame in saying "TO THE MOON!" or rooting for the price to rise.  I know you probably went to Bible Camp as a kid, and I know they probably drilled into your brain that wanting to be rich is a bad thing.  Or maybe you went to public school, and the government employees probably spewed the same stupid memes.  But believe it or not, investment, risk taking, saving, speculation, and the will to get rich are all **fundamental aspects of human nature** and they are all driving the species forward.

Well think about what's happening when you buy something with Bitcoin - you're giving it to someone else in exchange for a good/service that you believe to be of greater value than the BTC.  This has no effect on the market overall unless people are actively bidding the price of goods/services higher.
So let's say a TV is worth 500 dollars, and you offer someone 550 dollars worth of BTC to purchase it from them - this is an example of actively bidding the value of BTC lower.  The opposite is also true.  You could offer them 450 dollars worth of BTC instead, and this would be actively bidding the value of Bitcoin higher.
Remember that "hoarding" BTC isn't hurting the market - it's just removing some BTC from the supply that's currently being actively traded.  This removal of supply is what makes each unit of BTC more valuable.  As the units gather value, trade actually increases (believe it or not, this is a measured effect of the Bitcoin price rising).

Lol, nah it's not backed by faith.  [It's objectively better than other forms of money.](
Market participants gradually realize this over time, so we have periods of hype cycles.  But each hype cycle ends with more people who understand the network better (as well as new users who start buying their first bitcoins when the price is low).  The process will repeat several more times as bitcoin grows to fill its potential. 
But whatever you do, don't say bitcoin is backed by faith.  It's not.  It's backed by lower transaction and storage costs, as well as the *elimination of faith in a trusted third party* (ie banks and governments).

Because the value will continue to climb due to marginal utility of **storing** wealth as BTC.  Which Chris Dixon conveniently left out.
The problem is, wealth storage (aka hoarding) is frowned upon by Keynesians and other leftists, so they try to ignore that aspect of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin differs from other types of money in a few important ways:
1.  Zero trust - so you don't have to rely on a bank to make sure your transactions go through.  This is awesome if you live in an oppressive regime that limits how much money you're allowed to send overseas.  It's also awesome if banks don't like you, and refuse to give you an account.
2.  Zero inflation - the mathematically fixed supply makes it more trustworthy in the long run than fiat currencies.  So it's a great way to save money.
3.  Extremely low fees - sending money to anyone in the world, instantly, for free (or a few cents) is awesome.  Normally it would take a few days and it would cost $40.
4.  Global currency - once you accept BTC, you never need to convert it to other types of money.  It's like a universal language that allows you to travel anywhere in the world and experience the same prices other people do.

@_date: 2014-06-23 14:55:34


Right, but their options for obtaining that nominal amount of the currency are dramatically increased in a scenario where many people are spending the currency.  When supply increases, that drives value down.
Economics is pretty cool!  You should definitely look into researching price formation and the origin and purpose of money.  The Austrian school has a lot written on the subject.  


Nope.  People who save are simply waiting for a point in time where their savings are worth more.  A currency is used for exchange, so saving it simply means you don't see a compelling reason to exchange it yet.  Every individual has a different point where they will stop saving and disburse their currency.

Economics doesn't work this way.  Prices (the ratio different things are traded at) are anticipatory in nature.  Market participants know the reward halving is coming *long* before it actually happens.  So they take it into account when determining the value of Bitcoin, even prior to the actual event.
It's just like the stock market.  If traders know in advance that something major is happening soon, they act on it **now**.  That's why Apple's stock doesn't surge every time they release a new iPhone - it's not a surprise.

Secular deflation comes from the natural productivity of an economy increasing over time, which causes the value of each unit of currency to increase.
The kind of deflation Keynesians fear is what you get with a fiat currency based on debt.  When people hoard fiat, it increases interest rates which causes defaults on loans.  The defaults are cascading (since most of the money in the system is just credit, not M1).  The government, being the most-indebted of all, suffers the most.

Bitcoins are stored on the blockchain as transaction outputs, and those are stored by miners and nodes.  Your everyday user of Bitcoin (the guy who's not necessarily interested in mining or helping the network) doesn't actually need to be running any software or keeping a copy of the entire blockchain.  All he needs to store is the **private keys** to his Bitcoin addresses.  Each private key is a small string of numbers and letters, so it's literally only a few bytes.
Using these private keys, he's able to digitally sign transactions and send them to miners (who will then incorporate those transactions into the blockchain).

Transaction fees aren't based on %, they're a flat rate relative to the amount of data you're adding to the blockchain.

First, they don't control every transaction that's relayed - some blocks are still found by other miners first, and those can include transactions that GHash doesn't like.

True, but Democracy was considered fanciful and foolish.  There was always an elite ruling class that people deferred to.  Today, the opposite appears to be true - people generally find every government aside from democracy to be untenable.  It's a testament to the fluidity of government structure in the face of new "common sense".


Not exactly.  Bitcoins can be traded one-for-one on the ledger (mixing), and there is a type of transaction that obfuscates which chain of spending belongs to which person (CoinJoin).  Then there are stealth addresses and Tor IP obfuscation.  All of this will become very simple for the layperson to use in future iterations of Bitcoin wallet software.
Cash is problematic for a few reasons.  The first is that it is a local currency, only accepted in certain geographic regions.  Second, it's easy to seize it at checkpoints (dogs are even trained to be able to smell it).  Third, governments can always inflate more of it.  So in the event the "bad guy" burns his cash before the police can confiscate it, it's no big deal - the government can easily replace it.  The same can't be said for Bitcoin, which can be instantly sent anywhere in the world, with a fixed supply.
I would actually argue the existence of cash is a massive boon for Bitcoin, because it will allow people to obtain BTC without having to give an exchange their identifying information.  As Bitcoin becomes more widely-used, I expect cash-Bitcoin exchanges to become more and more common.


Wei Dai, who's a well regarded computer scientist and cryptographer, explained why digital cash is superior to physical cash in shutting out the state.  You might wan to look up what he said on the subject.  He's not a child, and he is very intelligent.
Basically digital cash allows for anonymity of exchange and the absence of potential physical force in exchanges.  Normal cash doesn't allow for this.
@_date: 2014-11-16 21:08:24
It's a recursive argument, though.  You're saying "these tokens are valuable because they can be used to transfer these tokens".
Obviously lower transaction fees are better than higher transaction fees.  So any money that can achieve zero transaction fees (along with fixed supply, and other properties that make a money useful) will be more valuable than money that requires transaction fees.

I think you're assuming a lot of things in your post.  First, infrastructure isn't nearly as expensive as you make it out to be - the recurring and steady returns associated with owning that infrastructure make it a fantastic long term investment for many people who are looking for a place to park their capital.
Second, you're assuming that the misbehaving monopolist would remain competitive after the new service rolls into town offering a more-neutral (or faster) Internet.  Keep in mind that businesses exist on their ability to generate profit, not absolute returns.  So a competitor doesn't need to service all homes in an area instantly.  It only needs to grab a few homes and keep them.  Once they have a proven track record of returns, investors would be thrilled to help them expand.

No, no, no.  I think what you're misunderstanding is that long term investments already take deflation into account.  People who are looking for a return on their money greater than the rate of deflation will invest in businesses and opportunities that could potentially achieve that.  They take the existing money stock into account when they make these investments.
You're also overlooking the Cantillion Effect, which basically impoverishes the rest of society so a few well-connected elites get to spend new money first (before it affects prices).

He's correct that people who buy Bitcoins locally (without using an exchange) tend to overpay.  There are a few reasons for this.  The first is convenience (not having to link up your bank account and wait days for the Bitcoins to arrive) and the second reason is anonymity (buying with cash).
In your case, you need to make sure you receive the Bitcoins **before** you send him the videogame items.  A Bitcoin transaction isn't like a credit card transaction - it's irreversible.  So there's a possibility you could be scammed if you send him the items before he sends you the Bitcoins.

The value of Bitcoin rises as it is used more-often (ie the more transactions occur on the network).

Are money laundering laws "society-wide agreements"?  I don't think they are - they weren't demanded by a majority of the public.  They were put into place by government officials without any public outcry for them.


The same government that is enforcing this "agreement" broke it's own agreement with Shrem:  the 4th Amendment.  Every day, the US Federal Government violates the 4th Amendment hundreds of millions of times.  Every.  Single.  Day.
So any agreements Shrem or others have made with the Federal Government would appear to be null and void, from a neutral legal perspective.  If one party can't fulfill its side of the contract, it's not worth anything.


Lots of interesting and loaded words here.
I'll start with "profit":  there's nothing wrong with making a profit.  No matter how hard you and other leftists try to portray it as a bad thing for society, profits are actually very good - they are the signals that direct production.  Without profit, there wouldn't be incentives for producers to direct scarce resources to ends that maximize the benefit of a society.
Lying isn't a big deal.  I mean it is in the context of cheating on your girlfriend, but when you're lying to an organization that counterfeits trillions of dollars every year and slaughters hundreds of thousands of innocent people, it's really not.

Bitcoin is plenty big for Wall Street - $7 billion companies are considered large there. And simple arbitrage strategies like the ones you're describing are few and far between today.

Two points:
1.  Price stability doesn't come from inflation.  It comes from predictable and unchanging supply and demand.  Bitcoin's supply is unchanging, while fiat currencies' supplies are less predictable.  So as demand for Bitcoin is satiated, the value will stabilize.
2.  Stability isn't even necessarily desirable.  Most people would prefer to have a money that gains value rather than maintains value.


It is if you can reasonably expect the value to grow over the longer term.  Different people have different time preferences.

@_date: 2014-07-13 05:45:38


No, they wouldn't.  Keep in mind that the more transactions the network handles, the more valuable each Bitcoin becomes.  So its in the miners' best interest to allow as many transactions as possible into the blocks.  If this weren't the case, miners wouldn't include any transactions in the blocks today - but they do it anyway, because they know if they didn't, BTC wouldn't be worth anything.

I don't think a seller could maintain a sub-250 price for very long.  Even if we aren't at the bottom now, still makes sense to load up on coins here (assuming your time horizon is longer than a month obviously).  Btw for disclosure sake:  I called bottom between 300 and 350 on r/BitcoinMarkets.

There might be a way to create some paperwork that shows the transaction occurred on the blockchain at a certain time.  You just need the people at the other end to verify they received the BTC with an email (and maybe a link to the transaction on blockchain.info).
It's worth it to set this up in advance if you're going to be doing repeat business with individuals &amp; companies overseas.  This is just something you need to coordinate.  Keep in mind that auditors and accountants should understand Bitcoin and how it functions - if they don't, that's their problem as professionals.

Value is measured from trade.  Bread has value, for instance - measured at $3 per loaf.  "But bread should be valuable regardless of whether people buy it or not!"  No, it shouldn't be.  Human **action** determines what's valuable and what isn't, not a philosophy of fairness/equity.  You can **say** something should be valuable all day long, but until people voluntarily trade goods and services for that thing, it has no value on the market.


Should, should, should.  We should all be selfless communists, only taking what we need and working very hard to produce for those less fortunate than us.  Fixed supply is a **very** strong selling point, whether you desire that to be the case or not.  The market demands it.

Hoarding helps Bitcoin because without it, Bitcoin wouldn't have a price - there has to be hoarders in order for the price to exist.
If people want to spend their BTC as the price rises, then that's totally up to them.  It's an individual's choice, and they shouldn't be pressured to sell or spend their BTC because "it helps the community".  That's nonsense.

Not exactly.  The problem with fiat is that people are forced to use it - not necessarily that it's centrally controlled or issued.  In the past, it was possible for governments to shut down competing currencies.  But blockchains now make this impossible.  So individuals can start their own currencies and the most-trustworthy individuals (who are ideologically supportive of sound money policies) will naturally have the most-used currencies.

Libertarianism actually isn't that controversial - most people, if given a choice, would prefer to pay less taxes and have less inflation.

@_date: 2014-05-02 06:24:48
I think he's overlooking the fact that Bitcoin places governments at a practical disadvantage when it comes to taxing, capital controls, and being aware of income.
Prior to Bitcoin, it wasn't possible to easily and cheaply move money around the world without the permission of local governments and banks.  It also wasn't possible to secure money from confiscation - physical assets like gold, homes, cars, etc. were all easily snatched up, and governments could simply make a phone call to any bank in the world and freeze an account.
If an individual criminal decided to destroy his money (rather than allowing government agents have it), it was a chore.  He'd need to physically burn cash or dump the gold in the ocean (or someplace unfeasible for divers to get it).  And in the case of cash, the government could always simply print up more to replace the burned money.
Bitcoin makes it possible to permanently destroy millions of dollars' worth of value with the flick of a button.  Or send those millions to an anonymous friend instantly.
So we have something, a new tool, which can finally give the common man the upper-hand in finance.  And the upper-hand doesn't come from any ideological basis, rather it comes from a technical basis.

With Bitcoin it's possible to digitally "sign" a statement using your private key.  People can use the digital signature to mathematically prove they control certain bitcoins on the blockchain.
So it's basically a complex math trick to prove you have the private key without actually showing anyone the private key.

I didn't downvote your question, I guess it was someone else, or the Reddit servers trying to obscure votes.
There are actually a few different arguments against taxation:  the ethical argument, the economic argument, and the practical argument.  I'll expand on each of them a little bit so you have a better idea of why libertarians and anarchists are so against taxation.
But first, let me start by pointing out that we libertarians are actually striving for the same goals you are.  We want everyone to be able to have a job that pays them "a living wage".  We want everyone to be able to afford a solid middle-class lifestyle.  We want everyone to have cheap healthcare, a great education, a secure retirement, and pothole-free roads.  We don't delight in seeing poor people, and we don't get giddy when we see an old person who couldn't save enough to retire comfortably.  In this way, we're just like you.
The key difference is, we think there are *better ways to achieve these goals*.  It's very similar to when downloading music online was a new thing - initially, there was a ton of pushback.  People simultaneously loved Napster, and hated what it was about to do to the music industry.  People feared that in the future, musicians would just stop producing good stuff.  They thought that if we didn't force people to buy music, only a few very wealthy musicians would make all the music, while smaller and indie bands would die out.
The reality turned out to be the exact opposite.  Free music downloads forced the industry to **compete** and give us better options, like Spotify, Pandora, and iTunes.  Indie bands have never seen a greater following.  The technology has allowed us to discover new musicians that we never would have found otherwise.  Musicians are still able to make money by performing live concerts and accepting donations.
This is the approach libertarians want to take with the goods and services traditionally provided by governments.  We want open competition.  We want people to have the option to use other services, and to pay a different provider.
So the three arguments against taxation are as follows:
1.  The ethical argument.  Who commits the worst atrocities in history?  Private businesses, or governments?  Unless you're really biased, you'll agree that governments generally kill, kidnap, and steal more than any other organization in human history.  When you are studying ethics from a philosophical perspective, you have to avoid internal inconsistencies in your logic.  In other words, rules must be applied fairly and evenly in all cases - they must be universal.  Taxation can't be universal.  It gives one group of people the right to steal from another group of people.  This is tantamount to slavery, on a fractional basis.  Most Americans work until sometime in late April/early May for the government.  All the money they earn between Jan 1 and April 30 is effectively the government's.  Slavery, even if fractional, is unethical.  Majorities ruling over minorities is also unethical and unjustifiable by any logically coherent ethics philosophy.
2.  The economic argument.  I would implore you to read the economist Friedrich Hayek's essay on The Use of Knowledge in Society.  You can read about it here:   Basically the argument is that prices are valuable information that guide production to satisfy consumer desires.  Taxation, regulation, price-fixing, inflation, etc. all serve to inhibit this information's distribution.  We need free markets to know where to apply our effort.  Governments add noise to the market's signals, thus reducing their productive outputs and making everyone poorer.
3.  The practical argument.  Politicians are humans.  That means they have friends, and they want to get rich (or at least richer than they are when they first entered office).  Politicians also seek power and control.  This is easily visible in countries like the US, Russia, the UK, China, Italy, etc. but it is also present (to a slightly lesser degree) in smaller states like Denmark, Norway, Peru, New Zealand, etc.  Let's face it:  governments are monopolists.  There's really no way around it.  It may sound like something a topless hippie would be shrieking at an "Occupy Wall Street" protest, but that doesn't make it any less accurate.  The vast majority of your tax dollars to go lining the pockets of politicians, their business partners, their friends... and locking up peaceful potheads.  Why do they do this?  Because they can.  **Because you have no choice.**  But the arguments in favor of taxation cite schools, roads, police (I guess the peaceful kind), and helping poor people.  Those things are great.  But just because a shit sandwich has bacon on it, doesn't mean the shit sandwich is good.  Choice, competition, always leads to better outcomes for consumers.  No, the music industry won't die when people have Bittorrent... and roads, schools, security, firefighters, and healthcare won't suddenly go away when people aren't forced to pay taxes.

Go to  and download the webpage to your desktop (you can find this option in your browser's menu, to save it as an html file).
Close your browser.
Disconnect from your internet entirely.
While disconnected, open the html file you saved.  The Bitaddress site will appear and you can wiggle your mouse around to generate some randomness.  This will create the private/public key combo, and you print that out (while still offline).  Do this as many times as necessary to make as many paper wallets as you want.  You might even want to print 2 copies of each key pair, one for your Christmas gifts and one as backup (that you keep in case they lose the paper wallet).
Close the browser.
Reconnect to the Internet.
Use your Bitcoin wallet software to send the coins to the addresses you've printed out.  You can scan the public address from the paper with the QuickMark app (which is available on Windows and enables your webcam to see QR codes).
Never scan the private key unless you intend to spend the coins, because that "de-virgin-izes" the paper wallet by exposing it to the Internet.

It's likely Bitcoin will always be associated with the grey/black markets because it makes it much easier for people to voluntarily trade without the Eye of Sauron (governments) knowing.  Sort of the same way cash is associated with drug deals.
But I think as time goes forward, Bitcoin will be associated less with that and more with posing a threat to central banks - which is why governments really fear it.  Once people become aware of the ability to store/transfer wealth in a way that doesn't involve cumbersome gold bullion &amp; real estate, they'll excitedly hop on board and banks will lose a big chunk of their business.  We'll also see a shift in how governments collect taxes, and a lot more "under the table" avoidance of taxes.

You're misunderstanding Gresham's Law, here.  It simply means people are more willing to spend away bad money and hoard good money (which is what will drive the value of dollars lower and the value of Bitcoin higher).


I don't mean to be rude, but you don't have expertise or understanding in this area.  It is remotely possible that someone could create a better cryptocurrency, but *highly* unlikely it will happen anytime soon.  David Chaum, Adam Back, Wei Dai, Nick Szabo, etc. have all been thinking about and working on digital cash for *decades* now.  They are brilliant computer scientists and mathematicians.  So if anyone could come up with a better solution than Bitcoin, it's most likely to come from them.

Sure, that's true for everyone.  I'm just explaining why I (and other Austrian economists) expect it to reach these levels.  I noticed what was happening and understood these arguments back before Bitcoin was 15 dollars, so I purchased as many as I could before that.  So far so good.


Well, it'll rise until it reaches a market equilibrium (supply and demand).  The value of something can't rise forever because eventually people will want to spend their Bitcoins - they'll buy yachts and mansions and HDTVs and all that fun stuff.  So Bitcoin will just stop rising in value when it finally finishes satisfying its utility (after destroying fiat).

If Bitcoin can hit a $1T market cap, that virtually assures it will hit a $2T market cap.
Reasons are outlined well here:  
For people who actually understand Austrian economics, the implications of this invention are staggering (if we assume the network is capable of holding up against attacks and unforeseen technical problems).  Even assuming a low rate of transactions, Bitcoin is still an amazingly good competitor to gold.  And gold's global market cap is over $7T last time I checked.

Why would anyone want a money that has an uncapped supply?


The exchange rate of Bitcoin is naturally volatile during this period because of information asymmetry - people like me know it's very valuable and invest for the long term, while people like you don't understand the computer science or the economics, so you trade its ups and downs.
It will naturally become less volatile as more people use it and interact with it.


Ah, the socialist's dream.  Never give up hope.  Maybe one day in the future people will prefer a growing currency supply to a fixed-supply.  But I wouldn't count on it.

It's possible that at some point in the future, computer technology will improve to the point where every single transaction can easily be accounted for on the blockchain.  But I don't think it will be necessary.  Reason being:  Bitcoin differs from gold and silver in that it is far easier to audit.  Banks issuing Bitcoin-backed "tokens" that trade off-chain will easily be able to prove to customers they have the necessary BTC to back each and every token.  If customers see those BTC move from the address, they will lose faith in the tokens and dump them.  You couldn't do that with gold.

Hello, Gotcha.
Anyway, here's my reply to your post, which you originally made using your other sock puppet account:


The Austrian economist Jorg Guido Hulsmann does a good job countering this fallacy here:  
Another pernicious aspect of inflation is the "Cantillion Effect", which harms the average working man by shifting purchasing power to the banking industry and politically-connected elites.  Inflation would be much less-harmful if the new money was distributed equally to each citizens' bank account at the same time.  The technology exists to do this, but they choose not to do it for obvious reasons.


First off, it's important to understand that intrinsic value doesn't exist.  All value is subjective to individuals.  Secondly, Bitcoin's value is derived from its usefulness as the first and most secure zero trust distributed ledger.  This allows it to bypass the need for a "central institution".


No, the block size will increase.  Also, as the block rewards decrease, the value of the rewards (as measured in fiat) will increase.  So this isn't a problem.


The peak only lasted one day, Black Friday.  And the transaction fee was just reduced tenfold.


This isn't a rebuttal.

Actually there are more "true believers" in Bitcoin today than ever before.  I've never seen such an overwhelming positive attitude about the long-term potential as I've seen lately.  Pre 2013 bubble, people were still worrying Bitcoin could go to $0.  We don't really see that as much today.  Considering the steady negative price action since last year, it's utterly astounding how positive and upbeat the community is.

It's okay.
If you have an Android phone, install Mycelium.
If you have an iOS phone, install Breadwallet.
For computers (both Macs and PCs) I'd recommend installing 
Before you store Bitcoins, do two things:
1.  Make sure your computer is virus free and has a reputable antivirus running in the background.  Malwarebytes is a great option.
2.  Make sure you have a backup of the wallet (usually called a "seed" which is just a list of 12-24 random words).  Write this on physical paper and hide it in a couple different locations.  That way if your house burns down you'll have a backup copy somewhere else.
For storing small amounts of BTC, you obviously don't need to go through all this trouble.  For larger amounts (thousands of dollars worth), you'll need to learn how to make secure offline wallets.
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:46:05

Mining Bitcoin is for the pros now.  You can buy cheap ASICs and make a couple bucks a day, but you're better off just buying BTC directly from an exchange.
If you really want to mine crypto, look at the charts to see which alt-coin is relatively cheap (sometimes Litecoin falls more as a % than Bitcoin does during a crash).  Try mining whichever one is hyped and in the news.  Lately it's been Dogecoin.  You can then trade that for BTC.
My best advice is to just think of mining like seeding torrents - don't expect to get much out of it, you're just doing it for the good of the community and the health of the network!

Yes, when the private key is imported, the funds are 100% online at that point.
You can actually spend from a paper wallet using the Mycelium app on your phone, which is a useful feature.  But you have to keep in mind the nature of paper storage:  it's only "offline" and secure if the private key was generated and then deleted while the computer was offline.  Otherwise it's not a virgin private key, there is some risk it was seen by spyware.
For this reason, when you spend from a paper wallet (even just a fraction of the total stored), the "change" you didn't spend will also be sent to a new address.  Ideally this change address will be a different/new offline paper wallet.  The old paper wallet is no longer considered secure because the private key has been imported.

To second what said, it doesn't matter if Bitcoin's transaction fees are high.  All that matters is that anyone can participate.  This will drive competition to create the most cost-effective off-chain clearinghouses you can imagine.  And it doesn't matter where these businesses are located.

Well the blockchain's growth will be relatively linear compared with the growth of digital storage capacity - in 10 years, having a petabyte hard disk will be common and cheap.  In 20 years, having a 10 petabyte hard disk will be even more common and even more cheap.


Because it won't be necessary!  :)
But I get where you're coming from.  I'm sure there will be some intrepid computer scientists out there who will figure out a way to dramatically reduce the size of the blockchain.  It's inevitable.


Actually this is another counter-intuitive thing about Bitcoin - as time has gone on (and ASICs have gotten more common), the mining has become *more decentralized* with time!  Most people imagine mining is becoming more centralized, but the opposite is true.


It will be.  It's another one of those inevitable things.  Some of the solutions will involve regular automatic "proof of reserves" that ensure customers that their tokens are actually backed with real Bitcoins and they aren't being Goxxed or Federal Reserved.
Basically my overall point is:  don't worry, be happy.

Mining is a topic that's heavily over-discussed by novices.  Basically it's not important at all for beginners to understand mining - just like it's not important for the users of dollars to understand how the Federal Reserve System works.  What newbies *should* understand is that the mining process is more fair than the Federal Reserve process.  The technical details of precisely why this is the case are fascinating, but I wouldn't recommend going into depth about it in your video.
Even the term "mining" is misleading.  Miners are basically just bookkeepers.  Bitcoin uses a blockchain file to keep track of all transaction history, and this enables the network to keep everyone on the same page with regard to who owns what.  It disallows double-spending of the same Bitcoins (which is the great innovation of Bitcoin to begin with).
Bitcoin is the world's first zero-trust, decentralized consensus network.  Before 2009, nothing like it had ever existed.  It's a **very big deal**.  Like... Gutenberg Press big.  The implications of this technology are staggering.
I would recommend reading some stuff by Nick Szabo on the subject of smart contracts and the history and origin of money.  I'd also recommend reading Wei Dai's writing about Bitcoin and how it relates to crypto-anarchy.  Also read Konrad Graf's paper on the subject of the origin of Bitcoin's value.
Do a youtube search for lectures by Michael Goldstein on the subject of Bitcoin, because he does a great job elucidating this stuff and its relation to libertarian politics and financial freedom.  If you want more help with this project, please keep in touch with me, as I am in close contact with many experts in this area.
Novice video ought to include the following (not necessarily in this order) -
1.  Explanation of how a Bitcoin address and private key are generated, and the safest way to store them (because this is fundamentally different from creating an email account with a password)
2.  Explanation that Bitcoin is decentralized and heavily redundant (meaning it is "antifragile")
3.  Explanation that Bitcoin is unlike any other digital currency that has come before it (because it solves the Byzantine Generals Problem - **we no longer need trusted third parties!!!**  This is something libertarians ought to be celebrating in the streets about!)
4.  Explanation that its value is derived from its properties that make it useful as money (gold bugs might not like this, but it's important that they understand Bitcoin is a serious competitor to their metals)
5.  Explanation that Bitcoin has extreme convexity as an investment.  The upside potential is enormous if you're buying now.
6.  Bitcoin is the world's first **programmable money**.  That's HUGE.  It's incorporeal nature is an advantage, not a disadvantage.
7.  Alt-coins like Litecoin and Dogecoin can't surpass Bitcoin (or even achieve a significant fraction of its market share) because they fail to exceed Bitcoin's network effect.  This is Metcalfe's law in action.  Daniel Krawisz wrote a great essay on alt-coins that you can google for and read.

@_date: 2014-10-02 06:04:58
Yeah this is possible to an extent (but not necessary yet).  The Blockchain is designed to allow spent outputs to be "pruned".  Also there are several realistic proposals for splitting the Blockchain in such a way that you only need the block headers to confirm a transaction. 
But keep in mind that Blockchain size really isn't a big worry.  Disk space is much cheaper than opening a bank branch and hiring a few full time employees.  Thus, bitcoin will always out-compete the old banking system.

It would cause unnecessary consumption to fall, as well as malinvestment, prices, and government spending.  Essentially it provides the market with more discipline and long term thinking, as well as rewards savers.  This only causes the economy to "slow down" in the sense that the nominal amounts of spending would likely decline.  The distribution of wealth in society would benefit from the elimination of the Cantillion Effect and higher interest rates, and there would be less pressure on the layperson to invest in risky stock markets in order to save for retirement.

You'll see ads for Circle and Coinbase later on, just give it time.  Even without ads, Bitcoin will continue to grow exponentially.  When people see how easy, useful, and straightforward it is to accept BTC, they'll experiment with owning a little BTC.  And that ownership will put them on our "team" so to speak.  They'll accumulate more as long term savings "in case it gets big".

Well the whole "Bitcoin is great because it's anonymous" thing is way overplayed.  The real reason Bitcoin is great is because it has lower transaction costs than any money humanity has ever devised:

Because the rich who buy Bitcoin in large quantities will have "the itch" to enjoy the wealth while they're still young and lucid.  And at that point, it's just a countdown ticker to when they are poor again - unless they can figure out a way to continually invest their BTC in profitable ventures (unlikely), they will continually get poorer as measured in BTC.
The elites today stay rich by providing favors to each other, and these favors are both political and economic, with the top of the pyramid being the Federal Reserve which enables the elites to remain there forever (even when they make poor investment decisions).
@_date: 2014-04-07 20:59:49


Actually mining has become less centralized since the introduction of ASICs.  Keep in mind that the software managing the pools and payouts is getting better all the time, allowing individuals to refrain from participating in a 51% attack.
And the nodes themselves determine which blockchain is the "correct" reference, even if it has a minority of total hashing power.
Centralizing Bitcoin simply isn't possible.

Trustless mixing, baby.
@_date: 2014-05-08 22:01:33
The blockchain isn't a record of ownership when it comes to Bitcoin, it is the ownership itself.
So if you have a private key, you have access to the Bitcoins and you don't require a trusted third party.
If you have a colored coin that represents the share of a company, you must trust the company to honor that representation.  The company might issue more shares (thus diluting the value of your colored coin), or simply refuse to give you your dividends.
@_date: 2014-08-20 19:22:27
If you want to use the Bitcoin network, you have to first buy Bitcoins.  That's the entry fee.
As more people want to use the network (because they see how useful, easy, fast, cheap, and non-political it is), they will demand more BTC.
It's really that simple.  It doesn't matter if they choose to hold or not.  Because whoever's doing the holding will enjoy the bulk of the price appreciation.

We can because the incentives are properly aligned, like they are in the Gates/Microsoft scenario.
The most likely attack on Bitcoin at this stage would come from a government or bank, but even this scenario is unlikely at this stage because the block reward is so high and Bitcoin itself is so undervalued.  Anyone contributing this much capital to destroying the network understands its long-term potential, and they will want to capitalize on it rather than destroy it.

The overarching point is that we can use distributed systems to issue tokens, rather than the blockchain itself.  This means not every transaction needs to occur on the blockchain - masses of transactions can be calculated and settled in larger batches, automatically, without the need of corporations or trusted third parties.

I would dispute this.  Altcoins are on the way out.  I think as Bitcoin becomes more well established and the network effect continues to work, altcoins will be viewed with greater and greater skepticism.


The protocol itself is fine the way it is, and could continue running for the next hundred years while providing a very valuable service.  Constant updates aren't necessary, nor are they particularly expensive.  The core devs also own many BTC and they will appreciate as the network is more widely used.  So they already have a financial incentive to see the project succeed.


Mr Buterin ignores the massive incentive for miners to cooperate and see the blockchain secured.  Incentives don't have to be direct - they can be indirect, and just as effective.


This is because software is cheap relative to hardware.  Sorry.


Satoshi foresaw greater centralization of mining, and acknowledged it.  He (rightfully) didn't view it as a problem.  Notice, however: mining pools are actually rather diverse and decentralized now, compared to the past 5 years.  We aren't seeing the predicted trend toward greater centralization yet, contrary to popular belief.

It is the world's first zero trust ledger.  This means it's now possible to prove things to other people without relying on third parties (governments, banks, record keepers).  This is great for property ownership claims as well as proving origination of intellectual property.  It even allows for people to prove they have a clean bill of health (it's a good way to show you tested negative for STDs, for instance, because a clinic can easily send a token amount of BTC to an address you control, as a signifier).
As a money, Bitcoin returns the power of seignorage to the people, and takes it away from the elite.  With fiat, banks and governments take advantage of the "Cantillion Effect" to covertly tax the middle and lower classes that hold dollars.  Bitcoin, by contrast, is a neutral money.
The network is also impossible to censor.  This means capital controls are no longer possible - people can send money throughout the world, without it being stopped or taxed by overburdening governments.  People can trade with one another, even when their country is under strict sanctions.  Trade prevents war and helps build mutual respect and friendship, as well as improving the quality of life for everyone.

It's no biggie.  I used to be worried about the size of the blockchain, too, but when you actually sit down and think about it it's not a big concern.  Here's why:
The cost of storage is going down at an exponential rate -  
At the current rate, a 1 petabyte hard drive will cost around $200 by 2020.
Now let's imagine Bitcoin is doing 6000 transactions per second (which is approximately what Visa and Mastercard do).  If you do the math, you'll find that after 100 years of this non-stop, the blockchain is only around 8.6 petabytes.
8.6 x $200 = $1720 (and that's 100 years in the future)
Compare this cost with the cost of building and operating a bank.  The vault alone costs more than $1720.  And there are thousands of banks scattered all across every city and town in America.
The core developers are looking into ways to "prune" the blockchain, too.  So realistically it's unlikely to ever grow to this size, but it's still not a problem.

Yep.  Imagine there was a digital currency that (somehow) didn't need a blockchain to operate.  If it was fixed supply, extremely divisible, cheap to transfer, easily stored, etc. then it would eventually become valuable.


No, that's not possible.  Bitcoin needs to have value in order for the blockchain to work (otherwise miners wouldn't bother keeping it up).  The block rewards and transaction fees are the incentive to keep mining.

Apparently you haven't heard of "multisig".  You should research it.  Bitcoin makes it possible for more than one party to be in agreement before the money can be spent.  This enables third parties (even hidden/untrusted parties) to participate in token issuance.

Blockchain size really isn't a problem.  The cost of storing a few dozen petabytes of data is actually a fraction of the cost of employing 4 or 5 bankers - so Bitcoin will always be cheaper than traditional banks.
Micro transactions don't *need* to occur on the blockchain itself, they can be settled in groups of thousands every so often (like once a day, or even once an hour).

Right, but the higher costs are rewarded by there being a higher value placed on BTC in mainland China.  It's just like marijuana, in that sense.


Well I don't think anybody is making that argument.
The argument we are making (or at least the Austrians like myself), is that government regulations really don't matter in the long run.  Bitcoin will ultimately supersede fiat because it's a superior money technology.  This poses some considerable problems for governments, particularly with regard to taxation and capital controls.  We will almost certainly see governments forced to reduce their tax rates in order to coax people to be more honest about their holdings.  The question is whether this transition will topple them in the long run, and I suspect it has a very good shot at that.
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:10:11

It still doesn't make sense, because nothing you've described so far has been impossible prior to Bitcoin - digital cash systems existed in the past, and governments could have easily enforced the "rules" backing them (for instance, the 21 million coin limit, and the instant international settlement of all trades).
But governments didn't do this, even though digital cash existed prior to Bitcoin.  Why didn't they?

Well it is a democracy, just of the parliamentary variety.  All democracy is a sham, though.  Even on issues that Americans overwhelmingly agree on, our government implements policies that do the exact opposite.
One solution is to bypass representatives (which are easily corrupted) and move to a kind of direct democracy implementation (perhaps involving the Internet).  Libertarian monarchy isn't a bad form of government, either (see:  Liechtenstein).

Same way the value (purchasing power) of any currency rises or falls.  Currencies are traded against each other.  So the "price" of a currency is just a ratio.
For example, go on Google and type in "USD in EUR" and you'll see a little chart and the amount of Euros you can buy with 1 dollar (right now it's 0.81).
The adoption (and thus the value) of Bitcoin will increase over time, because it's the best currency available in the world:

No, the value comes from the network effect coupled with the blockchain properties.  Again:  where do you think the value of any money comes from?

The whole point of the blockchain is that you don't need to rely on timestamps.
@_date: 2014-11-16 22:31:27
Here's the thing:  if you actually look at how Bitcoin has been used, particularly in the early stages back in 2009 and 2010, you'll see that people weren't interested in recording information in the blockchain.  They were merely interested in transacting and moving Bitcoins around.
So the use as money comes first.  Any other value the blockchain provides comes secondary to that.  I encourage you to read Konrad Graf's work on this, because it clarifies and elucidates these ideas.
Tokens can be valuable because they are useful as money.

Since decoupling from gold
[Yes, the decoupling in 1971 was very good for workers.](


Well yeah, if you ignore all the recessions and the period where the Fed had to jack interest rates up to 22% to reign in inflation during the 70's.  And ignore the housing bubble, the S&amp;L crisis, ballooning student loan debt, and the most recent downtrend.


Here's where I'm going to blow your mind:  **I actually agree with you, here.**  No, I'm not being sarcastic.  Fiat (and digital currency) is actually the best currency to-date.  It does have some major flaws (which you believe to be advantages - namely the elasticity of supply and central control).  But on the whole, it's far superior to gold and silver for a few basic reasons.  The cost of storing, dividing, sending, issuing, etc is far lower than with metal money.
The problem is that Keynesians like yourself have noticed these awesome benefits of digital currency, and you attributed them to the central control element rather than the fact that the currency has superior **physical properties** to gold and silver.  Digital currency made globalization possible, and for that we should all be thankful.
But we have found a better form of digital money - blockchain based currencies.  They offer superior protections from government predation, and superior (lower) transaction costs to fiat.


It's impossible to prevent bubbles on a local level, even with fiat.  Fixed-supply currencies do prevent them on the macro level, however.




That's funny, I've noticed Bitcoin's deflation is halted every so often by a market correction.  Hmm...


Krugman is on record praising the Fed's efforts to create a housing bubble following the Dot Com bubble.  So Bitcoin would prevent the collapse by not allowing the bubble to form in the first place.  The market was (and still is) awash in cheap credit.


Prices of goods and services would have been allowed to fall.  Home prices, in particular.  But also stock prices, gasoline, and food.  This would have massively benefited the poor.


You mean like Thomas Piketty, who recently published a 677 page tome titled "Capital in the 21st Century" that never once mentioned Internet currencies?  ;)


Ah, this old canard.  Try harder.  Surely by now Keynesians are aware that this critique of Austrians is threadbare.


Of course, it adds nothing new.  No new evidence, no new product, no new activity, no new business model, no new technology could ever alter the fundamental Keynesian ideology.  In that regard, it is very similar to Islam or another religion.

This is a tough nut to crack, and I've faced the same challenge explaining Bitcoin to my elderly relatives.
What really helped my 94 year old grandmother understand it was this:
I explained that it's very similar to a credit card network, except it doesn't have middle-men to verify the transactions.  Instead, the transactions are "proved" mathematically, in the same way that students must prove to their teacher that they did all the steps to find the solution.  They can't just copy the solution from their friend's test paper, they must show step-by-step the chain of math that gives them the solution.  So each Bitcoin is like a math problem, and the only way to spend it is for the network to show the steps it took for you to control it.
My grandmother was a school teacher, so she immediately got this analogy and the system made much more sense to her.
The next step is to explain the value of the network itself, and explain that the Bitcoins **are** the network.  They're not separate, like dollars are separate from the credit card network.  So the reason Bitcoins have value is because you need to buy them if you want to be able to use the Bitcoin network - dollars, euros, yen, etc. can't flow through the Bitcoin network.  Only Bitcoins can.
Why do people want to use the Bitcoin network rather than the traditional bank network?  Because it's cheaper, faster, less inflation, easier to send money to anyone in the world, at any time, etc.
@_date: 2014-10-13 19:01:28

I'm being serious.  Within 20 years.  And I'm not alone, several Austrian economists agree this is a real possibility.
It simply doesn't make sense that Bitcoin's value would ever "max out".  People aren't going to say, "I think I'll keep 20% of my money in fiat and 80% in Bitcoin!"  That's irrational.  Remember the fiat will be falling in value as people abandon it, and Bitcoin will be growing in value because it's not possible to inflate it.
Governments can make promises that they'll stop inflating their currencies, but humans always break promises.  Mathematics is more trustworthy.
@_date: 2014-02-04 01:34:35


Well they wouldn't **all** be spent.  Investors would always keep a certain % of BTC available for new opportunities as they arise.  Keep in mind that one person's expenditures are another person's income.  There's a yin &amp; yang type of relationship with a fixed-supply currency.
It's similar to when people wonder what would happen if a rich person decided to "buy up all the Bitcoins".  Bill Gates is worth around $50 billion, while every bitcoin in the world combined is worth around $12 billion.  So in theory, he could do it.
But what would actually happen in practice?  Keep in mind that at any given moment, most bitcoins aren't up for sale.  Most of them are in storage, being held by investors who are hoping they'll be worth more in the future.  So as Bill starts to buy, the quantity of bitcoins available on the market would start to fall, which would drive the price higher.  The higher price would delight the long-term investors, who would get excited and hold onto their BTC even tighter.
So value isn't something that's a fixed quantity or volume.  Rather, it's like a ratio.  People value things *in comparison* with other things.  Prices are ratios.

I'm going to respectfully disagree.  The 'case uses' you talk about in the final paragraphs are important (especially remittances), but it's important to note that that's not Bitcoin's **primary value proposition**.
Its primary value proposition is that it has a fixed supply - no other digital currency can claim that.  The fixed supply and digital nature combine to make it one of the best stores of value ever known to man.  One or two hedge funds have taken the first steps by purchasing 8-figures worth of BTC, and they aren't treating this like a short term trade.  Eventually other hedge funds will recognize that Bitcoin has two features that make it phenomenal for investment:
1.  Non-correlated asset (meaning it doesn't track the stock market overall - hedge funds LOVE these)
2.  Convexity (meaning it has the potential for massive future returns, upwards 100x or 1000x - hedge funds also LOVE these)
Just give it time.  Wall Street managers are proud.  They don't want to admit when they made a wrong call.  So naturally they will try to justify why they aren't interested in Bitcoin, even as the price continues to rise.  Eventually they will be forced to acknowledge the value proposition, and they will enter the market in a big way.  As noted above, some of them already have.  But there will be many more to follow.

Even then, you can't comply with the court order.  Just because someone has 51% of the network hash power doesn't mean they win every single block.  In order to comply with the court order, they'd have to perform a full-on network attack, thus destroying the currency entirely.
Bitcoin is an all-or-nothing proposition, which is why it's so valuable.
@_date: 2014-06-22 17:53:14

You're being confused by the "money = value" equation in your head.  Money is just a vessel for value to shift around in.  Value itself is invisible. Money is like a light we collectively use to try to "see" value.  It's not perfect.
So in this example, money was never created or destroyed. It was just assigned a different value based on supply and demand.  It's just like when Bill Gates offers to buy houses.  Money isn't created. Instead, more money is being demanded in exchange for the houses.
The economic phrase corresponding to this insight is:  **Money is not neutral.**  It's worth whatever people agree it's worth. 
We expect bitcoin to be worth much more in the future because it has superior monetary properties to both fiat currencies and gold. Market participants will gradually realize this over time, as they learn more about it.  Right now the market at large still views it as a scam / experiment / niche product.

You have a misunderstanding of how markets work, so I'll see if I can explain it better.
Prices are formed *at the margin*.  This means that the market determines the value of things that are currently being traded, not the things that aren't for sale.  So if your neighbor's house is just like yours, and it sells for 250,000, that doesn't mean your house is also 250,000.  It just gives us an estimation of what your house might also fetch on the market.
In the event that both your and your neighbor's house are on the market at the same time, that would increase the supply of homes in the area, thus reducing the price of both homes (price is informed by both supply and demand).  You and your neighbor would be in a bidding war, trying to get the attention of buyers who are passing through the area.  So you'd both be cutting the price of your homes.
But this doesn't mean every home in the neighborhood is cheaper.  Imagine if everyone in the neighborhood put their home on the market at the same time.  The price of homes in the area would fall dramatically (even more than in the scenario I explained above).
The same is true with Bitcoin.  The value of each Bitcoin is determined by the supply of BTC *that are for sale on the market at that particular moment*, interacting with the *demand for BTC at that particular moment*.
It has zero effect on the value of every other Bitcoin in existence.  We say those bitcoins are "worth" whatever, but they aren't really, because they aren't actually for sale.
If all people holding Bitcoins decide to put them on the market at once, it would cause the price to crash to zero.  If all people decided to stop selling forever, it would cause the price to soar to infinity.  But these two scenarios never happen in real life.  There are always a handful of people who want to buy, and a handful of people who want to sell.


The creation of money doesn't increase the wealth in a society.  It only creates a Cantilion Effect, which is where the counterfeiter gets rich at the expense of others.

LOL yeah, that's a great analogy for it.
Bitcoin is an example of a network where the benefits of "going along" far outweigh the benefits of attacking it.  In that way, it's similar to the Internet itself.
Yes, if you had a few billion dollars you could purchase the ASICs necessary to destroy the network (if only temporarily), but it's important to remind people that a few billion dollars can also buy you a **nuclear bomb**, or thousands of well-orchestrated terrorist attacks, or an attack on the **internet infrastructure itself** or the **electric grid**.
So in a weird way, Bitcoin is actually more anti-fragile than the very underpinnings of modern society.

I think you're confused because I used the term "natural right" to describe a social norm in my OP.  The reason I used that term was to simplify it for non-philosophical types, but I guess that only led to further confusion.
In truth, there is no such thing as a "natural right".  All "rights" are just social norms.  Some social norms are better than others for spreading peace and prosperity.
Governments and their laws aren't social norms, however.  They are top-down imposed rule structures, and the way they are enforced is asymmetric - I gave the example of taxation.  So laws like taxation aren't internally consistent, and thus they are illogical.  For a rule/norm to be internally consistent, it must be applicable to all people at all times.


I think the problem is that you're conflating society and government in your mind.  The two aren't the same.

You're thinking of the legacy fiat systems, and imagining that structure over top of the Bitcoin system.
With fiat, the digital money in banks isn't actually "real" money.  It's a representation of an agreement that undergirded by the government.  So if your digital money is accidentally deleted or hacked or stolen, it's not a big deal - the bank and the government can easily punch in the numbers again and you'll have the same amount of money as before.
The natural result of this situation is twofold:  1.  it's good in situations where money is stolen, and it's good for people who make money via loans (banks)  2.  it's bad for savers (inflation), and bad for enemies of the issuer of the currency.
There is no real distinction between the fiat that originally existed and the new fiat tokens (or cash for that matter).
With Bitcoin, there is a real distinction.  Either it's a real Bitcoin (read:  on the blockchain), and you are the sole proprietor of the private key, or it's just a token representing a Bitcoin.
For many transactions, a token is enough.  However, the key feature of Bitcoin is the fact it makes transfer, measurement, assay, accounting, and storage of these units **very cheap** - far cheaper than with gold or even paper bills.  The natural result of this will be that *people will need to rely less on tokens than they did in the past*.  They'll be able to use the actual currency, with the actual fixed supply.
That means for important purchases (stuff costing over 1000 dollars and maybe even some stuff below that level), merchants and individuals will often refuse to accept tokens in lieu of real BTC.  Bitcoins will be like a Cashier's Check or physical stacks of 100 dollar bills.  It will be more-desirable than the tokens.
Notice this wasn't the case with previous forms of money, because those monies lacked the incredibly cheap and convenient transactional elements Bitcoin has.

Bitcoin is basically 99% finished in terms of the core development.  The fundamentals of how it works are sound.  You'll hear a lot of fearmongering by developers who dream up new ways to implement the mining or making it harder for pools to exist.  But really it's just a bunch of nonsense.  They don't understand the incentive structures involved, and their proposed alternatives aren't any better than the original (in fact, they're usually much worse).
Justus Ranvier has written a lot of good stuff on this subject if you're interested.  You can see an example of it here:  


The miners will go with the code that helps Bitcoin's long-term development and growth.  Keep in mind that miners have a massive "sunk cost" (their ASICs) and they want those chips to be worth as much money as possible in the future.  That means they aren't interested in short term gains so much as they are interested in the longer time horizon.  So they will only mine on the blockchain that has reasonable and conservative code.

1.  It doesn't matter who's accepting the currency and what they do with it after they accept it - all that matters is the nexus of supply and demand (which is what forms the price).  So the fact that there are payment processors doesn't make an iota of difference.
2.  Mining pools aren't a big deal, never have been, never will be.  If anything, the mining hashing power has become *more* decentralized over time, not less.

I'm pretty skeptical of the idea that Cyprus had a direct effect on the value of Bitcoin.  I know that's the narrative, but I don't think it's actually the case.
In truth, the longer the Bitcoin protocol exists without hitches, the better its reputation becomes.  So I think we'll see wealthy people moving their money into it over the next couple years, after some Wall Street money goes in first.  Wealthy people in other countries won't use Bitcoin until it passes ~$6000 or so, I'd guess.

The problem is getting particularly bad in the last couple weeks.

It's exactly what happened to that caused everyone to finally be forced to leave to I think we need more active moderation on this front.  If someone has a genuine disagreement or concern, they aren't a problem.  **That's totally fine.**  The issue is the people who are persistently negative and crude, trying to lower the quality of the discussion, mocking the subreddit generally.

The vast majority of food is grown in certain small areas, by massive farms.  So farming has grown more centralized with time - dramatically so.  And we have more food than ever.
When Bitcoin started, there were only a few people mining (for a while Satoshi was the only person mining period).  So yes, Bitcoin is becoming more decentralized with time.  The advent of ASICs was a period of relative centralization, but that trend is reversing again thanks to the commoditization of ASICs. 
The Bitcoin price is variable, which makes mining a difficult business to predict and thrive in - the pools who are ahead today will likely not be ahead in the coming months/years, because they aren't always profitable and they can't always predict where the price is heading.  Miners and investors can wait for them to go bankrupt or start bleeding money before they enter and begin mining after the price has fallen.
There are far more variables involved in mining than most people are aware.

Bitcoin is useful for transactions (it's actually easier to use than credit cards, once you get the hang of the software), but the price is supported by holders (aka "hoarders").  The limited supply of the currency, coupled with the growing acceptance and uses, are what drive the price higher.  The bubble that occurred in December of last year was typical for the currency, which has hype cycles where people get greedy, followed by crashes where people get fearful.  But underlying all that is real, steady growth in the number of new users.

Nope.  If you had asked this question 2 years ago, I would have enthusiastically told you to go buy a nice graphics card and crank out some BTC.  But these days mining is extremely competitive and you'd spend more on electricity than you would receive in BTC.
But don't worry - mining is the boring part of Bitcoin.  The exciting part is what you can do with the BTC once you have them...


I'm not sure exactly what you'd make, but it's probably something like $1 worth of Bitcoin a week. 
My recommendations for beginners like yourself:
1.  Buy some Bitcoins on   Once  is open for everyone, it'll be easier to use that (because it sends you the BTC right away unlike Coinbase which takes a few days).  But in the meantime Coinbase is reputable and a pretty good service.
2.  Be sure to always use "2 factor authentication" when you're dealing with Coinbase.  You'll see it in the settings.  This is an option where you can enter your cell phone number and any time someone tries to send BTC from your wallet, your phone will receive a text message and you can confirm it or not.  Basically it makes stealing your Bitcoins next to impossible.
3.  Bitcoin is generally a very deflationary money, which means it's a good idea to hold onto it if you can.  As it gains popularity, it will also gain value.  The "crashes" you always hear about are just natural market corrections - anywhere from 50-75% drops from the peak of the bubble.  We are currently near the bottom end of the trend, but there's always a chance it could drop lower.
4.  Don't think of mining as a game.  It's primarily the verification of transactions, which is a boring and arduous task requiring a lot of electricity and specialized hardware.  But understanding **why** mining is necessary is a really fun and interesting thing to study.  Here's a good video giving an overview of it:    Here's a good video giving an overview of "public key cryptography", which is the basis for Bitcoin's address system:  
5.  Besides the interesting technology behind Bitcoin, you should also understand precisely **why** it is such a major invention.  It has been called the biggest advance in money since the 15th century.  Here's a good lecture on the subject:

I think where you're getting confused (or being willfully ignorant) is in your understanding of exchange.
Yes, people will accept inferior money.  But they will generally charge a higher premium than if they were accepting better money (Bitcoin).

The only way to do this would be to get cash and then use the cash to buy Bitcoins on localbitcoins.com from a person selling in your area.  Or you could just buy the Bitcoins on Coinbase and claim you sold them to some hobo for cash later.
This is a little bit complex given your goal.  To be honest, you might be better off storing your money as cash and burying it in a non-metal (so a metal detector can't find it) airtight container that has been double sealed.
If you believe in the long term potential of Bitcoin, however (like I do), you might want to invest in it and just hold the BTC for a few years to see what happens.  That's a separate issue from hiding money.

1.  Why would they be valued the same?  BitDollars would be fundamentally different from both paper dollars and bank account dollars.  This would cause traders to break the peg.  BitDollars would be in higher demand by people who wanted to take advantage of the technology, and that would force their relative value higher.
2.  True, the people are slow witted.  But they would eventually switch to Bitcoin when they notice that it has a better hash rate and zero inflation.
3.  They'd actually be tougher to get if you lived in other countries - Bitcoin has global appeal.

You (and most others here) just can't handle the idea of your investment falling in value.  I've been buying since Bitcoin was 7 dollars.  I've been through more crashes than you have.  Deeper crashes.  I understand why Bitcoin is actually valuable - because it is decentralized.
We should expect the value to fall as it becomes more centralized.  Not to "punish" anyone.  Just as a recognition that Bitcoin is losing that property that made it valuable to begin with.

Even at 10x the current market cap, Bitcoin is still pretty small.  But it's big-enough that stopping it is out of the question.
If governments stopped it now, via a 51% attack or outright banning it, you'd see some small protests and a handful of very angry former-millionaires.  You'd see more conservatives paying attention and saying, "Holy shit, we really do live in a fascist society!  We aren't allowed to use our own money!"  You'd see the trust in government fall even further than it has already.
But that's only if the government stomped it out today.  If they wait and stomp it out when it hits $70 billion, it will be a much bigger deal, because many more people will have their livelihoods and businesses tied up in Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is like an ivy.  Right now it's on one side of the house, slowly crawling up the wall.  It's still possible to isolate it.  But as it grows and begins to get its tendrils deeper into the bricks, removing it will be exponentially harder.  Ultimately it will choke and suffocate whatever government is in its way.

Well Bitcoin will still benefit poor people in the long run.  Risks are taken by wealthy people in every economy - that's how capitalism works.  You accumulate capital, then risk it while trying to accumulate more capital.
The middle class and lower classes don't have the disposable capital necessary to take these risks, so they will be among the last to adopt Bitcoin (and that's okay).
Heavy hitters (aka "whales") are what helps support the Bitcoin price and ecosystem, and a larger market cap is necessary for the Bitcoin network to be more useful for everyone.
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:35:43


But this is an artificial distinction, not an economic one.  It doesn't matter who's accepting the BTC and what they do with those BTC after they accept them - the only thing that matters is the supply/demand nexus.
If the payment processors shut down tomorrow, the price would fall, but it wouldn't be dramatic - probably only 20%.  The businesses would then quickly set up their own wallets and resume accepting BTC (and selling them on an exchange manually).  The price would again rise.


Right, but the mining pools won't collude to work against certain transactions.  They know that Bitcoin's neutrality is (partly) what gives the currency its value.

Well keep in mind that here you're assuming Bitcoin will continue to appreciate rapidly.  While this is a likely assumption (in my view, and the view of many Austrian economists), it's still a risk and it's not an assumption everyone will hold.  So taking out a mortgage or any kind of loan in Bitcoin might actually pay off handsomely for the person borrowing the BTC, in the event it crashes to zero or falls in value.
The risk/reward calculation is done by the market participants, we can't just assume how they'll measure/value the risk.


Yep, it does.  So think about what's happening now with Bitcoin:  some people are choosing to take on risk (the long-term investors aka "hoarders") and others are choosing to avoid that risk (businesses that use BitPay and Coinbase to instantly convert BTC payments to fiat).
This is a healthy market.  Risk is transferred away from the people that don't want it, and onto the people that do want it.  Just like in the commodities and FOREX markets (as you so aptly pointed out).


Correct, they rely on centralized markets to interface with fiat and traditional banks.  But in a world where there is only cryptocurrency, centralized markets for this purpose wouldn't be necessary.


Coinbase and BitPay allow businesses to hedge risk away from themselves and transfers that risk to holders of Bitcoin.
I think a lot of Keynesians and traditional economists view this as "cheating" or "not really participating in the Bitcoin economy".  But this is an unfair accusation.  These same people also accuse the people who **do** choose to hold onto their Bitcoins of being "hoarders".
They can't have it both ways - hoarding *and* immediately converting to fiat can't both be bad for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Typically in a scenario like this, the FedGov can just print the necessary money to "fill the hole".  With Bitcoin, they can't.  Also, with Bitcoin there's a big incentive for other governments to protect and give shelter to wealthy tax evaders.  This isn't possible in the traditional banking system, because accounts can be frozen and gold/silver/cash can be intercepted at borders.
Governments won't be brought down by one tax evader.  Rather, it will be a million tiny paper cuts.  There could even be citizen assurance contracts that automatically lock up a certain % of protestors' BTC if there are enough participants.  Tax evasion has never been so easy, so powerful, and so fun.  :)

Basically any time someone comes up with a new currency for you to invest in, be skeptical.  Ethereum would have been worthwhile and interesting if it didn't have the "ether" currency with it.  The whole "Turing complete" buzzphrase was laughed at by developers who actually understand this stuff.  Mastercoin had the same kind of bogus claims and the same kind of illiquid currency.
If you're looking for something worthwhile that's similar to Ethereum, look at Open Transactions by Chris Odom.  He gives a good speech about it, and you can find it on youtube.  OT is the real deal.  It's open source and it doesn't have any attendant currency to make the developers rich.  And it does a LOT of cool stuff.

It can't get squashed unless the governments of the world succeed in completely destroying the network (which would be extremely difficult and expensive).  It would be like trying to censor the Internet.


No.  Traditional payment systems that use fiat are heavily regulated and rely on the old banking system.  It's not possible to regulate what I'm describing because it doesn't ever touch fiat, only Bitcoin.  And it can service any individual anywhere in the world, no matter where it's located.

Gavin is correct, Peter is being dramatic.

Well I'm definitely not emotionally married to believing the price was 'really' above $1000, because I sure as hell didn't buy any BTC at that level, and it was only at those high levels for a short period of time.
I think today pulling off that kind of heist / manipulation would be much more difficult.  In a strange way, I actually get a thrill when I see the price falling near $300 and below, because to me it's just "getting it out of its system".  Once the market is done puking, it can brush its teeth and begin to eat again.  I think there is definitely fundamental support for this new digital commodity, so [I'm not worried at all.](

It's really hard to say, but I'm going to guess it will reach a temporary plateau around $200,000 (while the software is upgraded to incorporate more transactions per second and there's some uncertainty about its future).
It's open source, though, and a 51% attack isn't nearly as dangerous to Bitcoin as a lot of people worry it is.  Even in the event of a malicious government attack on the network, the blockchain (and thus the ownership of every Bitcoin) would still be preserved as a digital file spread across the globe.  It would eventually spring back to life, like a hydra that can't be killed.
Ultimately if it does as I expect, it'll hit over $3 million per BTC.  But by then the dollar won't be a feasible currency to measure value anymore.

That's because gold isn't convenient for transactions, only for storage (and even for storage purposes it's pretty lackluster).  Bitcoin is liquid, convenient for transactions, and costs nothing to store in large amounts.  So there's really no reason to ever use a bank.

I've considered this subject extensively for over a year now, and my own personal view is that mining will become more decentralized as computer technology improves.  I think a lot of these people who are tearing their hair out over mining are forgetting that mining isn't exactly the most profitable endeavor around - it will probably always be possible to make more money investing in other sectors of the economy.  The current mining craze is due to Bitcoin's novelty and its use among geeks (who enjoy tinkering with things and buying computer hardware, or bragging that they are "mining" BTC rather than simply buying it).  Also, ASICs haven't yet become commoditized, and they certainly haven't maxed out their potential power efficiency. Then we must remember that it's far easier for a million people to each waste $1 worth of electricity than it is for one person/organization to waste $1 million...

Bitcoin was first created and adopted by libertarians and Anarcho-Capitalists.  We were the ones who got this ball rolling.  No amount of bellyaching by leftists such as yourself can change that.  Bitcoin **is** Anarcho-Capitalist in nature.  What else could it be?  Bitcoin bows before no authority.  Bitcoin doesn't wait for a government to approve a transaction.  Bitcoin doesn't withhold tax.  Bitcoin doesn't inflate arbitrarily, at the whim of a few elite bankers.
And that's why Bitcoin is great.

I agree, this is a fault with Mycelium and it needs to be fixed.
I disagree with Gavin, though.  Transaction fees need to exist (and fluctuate) to account for the scarce resource of network bandwidth and storage.  Also, not every Bitcoin transaction needs to take place on the network - the vast majority of BTC transactions will likely be off chain at some point in the near future.  People will use the main Bitcoin chain to save money for the longer term, rather than as a way to buy drinks in delis.  This is a perfectly acceptable outcome.

It would be much easier at that stage for the government to secretly acquire a large amount of BTC on the market (and via taxation), then dump the dollar.  Keep in mind that there is competition between nations, and the nation with the most BTC will effectively be the global leader in the post-dollar world.  The dollar system is on its way out, and the central bankers (and Pentagon) are aware of this.  I just don't see them trying to destroy Bitcoin when it comprises such a big chunk of their own citizens' economic welfare.  Plus other governments would jump in to salvage it.

@_date: 2014-07-03 19:14:19
There are several primary features of Bitcoin that set it apart from other digital currencies:
1.  Anyone can participate in the mining/verification process - it's open to all comers.  There is no "official" mining license or key.
2.  The open ledger.  Anyone can see which transactions are being confirmed, which are being ignored, and exactly how great/small the inflation is.  This is a massive advance, considering other digital currencies today are opaque by comparison.
3.  Bitcoin is open to competition by other blockchain based currencies.  If it is corrupted, value will flee into other commodities/currencies.  You might wonder, "Well isn't this the case with every other currency out there?"  Not exactly.  Keep in mind that Bitcoin is an "all or nothing" proposition.  Either the protocol is functioning correctly, or it's not.  Either the block rewards and inflation rate is correct, or it's not.  There is no "in between" or wishy-washy interpretation by a judge/politician.  It's math.  Non-blockchain digital currencies have always been given leeway by investors because of the simple fact that no other alternative was possible at the time.  It was always assumed governments would debase their currencies to one degree or another.  The only question was "how much?" and "how quickly relative to other currencies?"  Bitcoin is held to a much higher standard, given that it's not backed by a government and given its original source code and intent.  Traders will abandon it if it is corrupted.

Well you pay interest to borrow money because of "time preference".  Humans would rather have money now than have it later - time is valuable.  That's where interest comes from.  It's the time value of money.

But all other conditions aren't the same - demand is increasing faster than supply, therefore it is deflationary.
I think I see what you're trying to do:  you want Bitcoin to be inflationary so you can claim that people like inflation, thus they are adopting it.  That's really funny.

You're assuming there aren't massive economic incentives to ensure the neutrality and integrity of the blockchain.  If a government wants to control Bitcoin, it will have to first align itself with the interests of other Bitcoin users (by purchasing ASICs).  Then it will have to continually purchase more ASICs (and operate them) at a massive loss.
It's simply not in their best interests to do this.  Their best interest is served by joining the Bitcoin network as an honest participant.

They listen to shitty pop music and consistently vote republican/democrat.  They don't move markets.  Traders do.  Laypersons are simply the mules that make your hamburger at the fast food place.  What does a layperson immediately ask when they hear about bitcoin?  "Where can I spend it?"  They are brainless consumers, not long term savers.  They will not be adopting bitcoin anytime soon.

This rosy picture you paint isn't nearly what we see in the real world.


There's really no way to measure this, of course, so it's pure speculation on your part.


That wasn't a wage disparity chart.  It was an overall wage-earners chart showing the increased productivity not matching with increased worker earnings.  It has nothing to do with Gini coefficient or anything like that.  Income inequality isn't bad in-and-of-itself.  What's bad is robbing workers of excess gains due to productivity via the stealth tax of inflation.

Tokens would be used that represent BTC (and they could function on a separate, public "blockchain" that is controlled by a company - for maximum openness).  The only time BTC would be used is when an individual chooses to redeem BTC for his tokens (ie a "settlement").  That would only happen as often as people feel a need to do it - for instance, whenever the amount of tokens they hold exceeds $1000 worth of BTC.
@_date: 2014-09-30 14:15:13

The poor have a greater % of their holdings as money, while the rich have a greater % of their holdings as stocks/bonds/investments.


Home prices will fall in this case, because the market wouldn't clear at higher prices.  It actually makes housing more-affordable for the poor.


This is a jumble of buzz words.  But unless you can show how printing money increases the wealth of the middle class, you're not helping your case.


Deflation helps anyone who saves money.  As I said above, poor people tend to not put their savings in risky investments - they keep it in currency.


Poor people are in debt today because they need to be in debt to stay afloat in the inflationary environment.
In a deflationary environment, poor people wouldn't need to be in debt.  Prices would constantly be falling, and interest rates in banks would be higher, thus helping savers.

This is the kind of ridiculous price action people believe indicates a "healthy" market.  Real markets don't actually move like this, because if they did, they'd immediately get flooded with people looking to ride the wave higher (thus creating a bubble).
Price action is recursive, it's self-reinforcing.  And while I don't know if your theory is true or not (I think it's possible, considering what bad security Mt Gox had), it doesn't really matter.  Bitcoin's current price action is completely within the realm of normalcy.  And if Bitcoin were currently trading for $5000, that would also be completely within the realm of normalcy.  The price **will not** be predictable.  That's what makes it a market.

Right, but the alternative (saving your money and delaying instant gratification) is actually cheaper.  So credit cards still prove that people have time preference, and are willing to sacrifice value in order to have things sooner.  That's why a deflationary currency isn't a problem.

Less secure compared to what?  At a certain point, it doesn't make sense to be spending so much on security (see:  US military industrial complex).


Ask the people who move millions of dollars of value over Bitcoin on a daily basis.  They seem to think this level of hashing is good enough.  As the price increases, the hash rate will increase to compensate.  Not that hard to understand.


What % of Bitcoin transactions have been "double spends"?  Keep in mind we're comparing Bitcoin to the legacy financial system, here.  So it doesn't need to be perfect - only better.


This is just false.  The latest ASICs can easily sustain the current hash rate at the current price (or even a lower price).


Hence why you're wrong, as usual.


You see ghosts where there are only shadows.  Come out from under your bed.


If Bill Gates had enough money, he could buy F-16 jets and bomb Microsoft's headquarters.


Then you should be shorting Bitcoin as we speak!


Okay, so even if we assume these things were egregious and horrific attacks on the fundamental trustworthiness of the Bitcoin protocol, you need to remember:  **compared to what**?  Banks make mistakes all the time.  They rob people all the time.  Businesses embezzle money all the time.  Governments inflate all the time.  Bitcoin still comes out on top.


No, it's supposed to convince the lurkers reading our dialogue.  You are a lost cause.


Because that's where you keep going, if through nothing more than implication.


Many things are possible.  But they don't happen because of the alignment of incentives.  Just because Bill Gates can destroy Microsoft by bombing the headquarters, doesn't mean he will.


Could Bitcoin be improved?  Absolutely.  Is Bitcoin better than the existing global financial system?  Absolutely.

Pretty darn low.  There's no indication the number of full nodes needs to be particularly high, certainly not as high as it currently is.
If transactions have trouble propagating, miners will help finance more nodes.  They're not that expensive (certainly not nearly as expensive as ASIC chips).
@_date: 2014-04-01 19:00:41


This isn't true.  Cash is often tagged with invisible ink, red ink (from cartridges bursting during bank robberies), and serial number tracking.


Well it helps when your goal is to get away from a tyrannical government, yes.  Entering other jurisdictions with your wealth intact is a nice plus.  :)


Also you're not allowed to take more than $10,000 cash through TSA checkpoints in airports, and you must declare all your cash holdings.


They could do it, but nodes and clients would just reference the blocks that contain valid transactions and ignore the government's blocks.  A 51% attack isn't as big of a deal as people fear.  Gavin Andressen has discussed this at length, and so has GMaxwell.

I just don't think it will be a problem going forward.  Keep in mind that the miners and largest holders of BTC want to maximize the value of BTC, so they will do everything in their power to grow the network.  That means they'll finance more nodes, bigger mining rigs, help decentralization (when necessary), discourage centralization, increase transactions per second, etc.
Holding Bitcoin is like holding a stock option.  So you actually have a financial incentive to see the network perform well.

It's true that you'd need that setup if you wanted a true "zero-trust" system, but it's not necessary.  Bitcoin isn't actually zero-trust, but it's very close.  It's more reasonable to call it a *distributed trust* system.
So in the future, it's entirely possible (and likely) that further distribution of trust could take place, perhaps in order to increase the number of transactions per second into the millions.

Blacklists don't matter.
The reason is simple:  Bitcoin, like fiat currency, and like government, is just a social norm that people accept because it is beneficial for all parties to accept it.  Just because one group of people (in this case a government) decides to blacklist some BTC, doesn't change the **monetary properties** of those BTC.  They'll still be in scarce supply, they'll still be uncensored, they'll still be divisible, they'll still be transportable, etc.
For every one company/individual who refuses to accept blacklisted BTC, there will be dozens that want them - and will be willing to offer the same goods and services for them.
EDIT:  I also wanted to add that there are always offshore mixers and CoinJoin, as well as stealth addresses.  BTC can travel from address to address until there is no way for a government to demonstrably prove they are "dirty money" anymore.
This whole blacklisting business is just statist circlejerking.
@_date: 2014-02-20 00:41:02


Just because something doesn't completely destroy all governments doesn't mean it's not "anarcho-capitalist".  That's like saying Rothbard's book *Man, Economy, and State* isn't anarcho-capitalist because it didn't dissolve every government instantly after it was published.


Sure.  And a state could murder me and my family.  The state could ban guns, 3D printers, etc.  I'm not sure what your point is, here.  Just because a state can do something, doesn't mean a particular technology isn't anarcho-capitalist in nature.


Sure, but physical bills are much harder to maintain and bring through borders and checkpoints.  They are also not global - most national currencies are only useful locally, and the cash can't be transferred instantly anywhere in the world, to anyone.  They are also susceptible to inflation, which is governments' way of stealing from savers.


I love the language you use here, it's really interesting from my perspective.  I am "dishonest" and "cheating" if I don't acquiesce to the State's threats and claims on my property.


Gold can be used to avoid taxes and inflation, so it's a good anarcho-capitalist technology.  But it's far more primitive for those purposes than Bitcoin is.  Gold is a sling shot, Bitcoin is a tomahawk missile. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 03:23:56


Sure, but the relevant question is whether this exploit makes Bitcoin a risky or bad system in comparison to other currencies.
You'll have to admit that the number of double spends has been astronomically low, especially as a % of the total number of Bitcoin transactions.  Thus, Bitcoin is more secure than most currencies / payment systems.  In fact it's probably more secure by quite a wide margin.

Even if they crashed the market, each block acts as a sort of "save point", and we could reconstitute the unspent outputs prior to the crash using a different type of blockchain and mining method.

Also, Bitcoin was far more susceptible to a 51% attack earlier in its life - still nothing.  The fear is obviously overblown.  But you're welcome to think it could happen any minute now.  It just gives the intelligent people more time to buy up cheap BTC.
Burdensome tax issues - not really, unless you're dealing with massive amounts of money on a daily basis.  And in that case, Bitcoin makes it very easy to track all purchases and sales you made, and when you made them.
Some people losing their BTC to scams and computer issues - same thing happens with any other money.  It's actually easier than ever to secure BTC, and there are several guides online explaining how to generate paper wallets while offline.  I've had hundreds of dollars worth of BTC on my Android phone for months now (with the basic Mycelium app), and never had a problem.

Of all the factors affecting the price, the halving is pretty far down the list.  Miners hoard the BTC when they expect the price to rise, and sell it when the hash rate is very competitive and the price is falling.  New users and investors have the biggest effect on the price.

Because Bitcoin is a fixed-supply currency, that means as more people use it, the value of it goes up.  So there's a built-in incentive for all Bitcoin users to want more people participating and using the network.  The easiest way to get people to try Bitcoin is to send them some.

If he never used them, he wouldn't be extracting wealth from society.  He would only be doing that if he **spent** his BTC.


The price wouldn't permanently crash, it would only temporarily fall while fast traders snap up the cheap BTC.  It would be like a rich person throwing a bunch of gold coins into the street.


They can only exercise this "power" by spending their BTC, which reduces their holdings.  Compare that with the current model, where central banks and governments can inflate and tax as much as they want, whenever they want.


Nope.  It would actually help the poor.  Here's a video explaining why deflation isn't a big problem:

Oh I totally agree with you.  Socialism and government are just a couple of the many challenges the human species has had to contend with over the years.  Ultimately technology will help us to overcome them, too.  I think Bitcoin will be a big part of that.
As an Anarcho-Capitalist, I view governments as predators and parasites.  I'm perfectly aware that most people in the world actually *like* their government - even North Koreans.  So I don't think the solution to these problems will come from ideological shifts.  It's just not possible to convince a majority of people that taxation and regulations are bad.  The solution will happen via technological breakthroughs.  Bitcoin and 3D printing are the key ones right now, and there will be more on the horizon.

Bitcoin works with public/private key pairs.  So unlike an email address where you choose your own password, instead it's a **mathematical relationship** between the public key (the address) and the private key.  When you spend some bitcoins, you don't actually reveal your private key to the network - instead, your computer just "signs" the transaction using the private key and the network checks the signature.  Using the signature alone, **you prove to the network that you have the private key without ever having to reveal it!**  It's like magic, but it's just complex math.  Here's a video that explains it in more detail:  
So a paper wallet is just when you print out a new public/private key pair that your computer generated while you were offline.
The Bitcoin network doesn't care that you made the address while you were offline, because it doesn't need to know your password (private key).  All it needs to know is where you want to send your bitcoins.  Once you've sent your bitcoins to the address on the paper wallet, you can spend them in the future by using the private key to digitally sign a transaction.  You don't import the private key from a paper wallet until you are ready to spend, though.  Because the longer a private key sits on an Internet-exposed computer, the greater risk there is of a hacker or virus stealing it.

I agree.  Libertarianism will never be implemented because it is popular, or "the will of the people" - most people want to be ruled.  Most people want to be united in poverty, rather than independent in abundance.
Technology is what will destroy the state.  Basically we need to make enforcing laws *extremely difficult/expensive*.  Bitcoin is just one element of this, but there will be others.  In particular:  new self defense technologies that are automatic/easy to use, and allow anyone to defend themselves against police.

Excellent essay (from what I've read so far).  Don't expect it to get much attention here on but please post this elsewhere as well.
I think it's important that we distance ourselves from the faux-"Austrians" who claim Bitcoin isn't real money.  The Austrian school is the only school of economics that has identified and explained Bitcoin's massive value proposition, and we need to ensure it is remembered in the future as the only school of economics that was capable of doing so.  This is going to lend massive credibility to the Austrian school in the future.

Nodes only serve to relay transactions and blocks throughout the network.  The actual confirmation of transactions is done by the miners.  And even if evil miners (who aren't interested in making money) managed to get more than 50% of the total network hashing power, they still couldn't necessarily control the network - the network isn't democratic.  Blocks are discovered by minority miners all the time.

I'm afraid it's not that simple.  Bitcoin is unique because it's a protocol that benefits from the network effect.  Competing blockchain-based protocols (ie "altcoins") always end up losing ground to Bitcoin over time.  There will likely not be another opportunity like Bitcoin, at least for a very long time.  My recommendation would be to skip the altcoins and stick with Bitcoin for long term investment purposes.

It allows people to send each other bitcoins without anyone being able to look at the blockchain and seeing who received the coins.
Basically you publish your "seed address" online, and if someone wants to send you money anonymously they can use the seed address to generate a unique, totally new Bitcoin address.  They then send the money to this new address, and you can access it because your private key works with every address that's generated from the seed.

To understand where the money went, you have to understand how prices are formed to begin with.
Think about a neighborhood with 100 houses, and all the houses are fairly similar.  At any given moment, 3 or 4 of the houses are for sale.  The other 97 homes aren't for sale because families are busy living in them.  In this scenario, we use the selling-price of the 3 homes to determine the "value" of the other 97 homes.  So if one home sells for $300,000 then it's safe to say another home that's similar will sell for a similar value.  Then you just add up all the homes in the neighborhood and you can say (in an abstract way) "This neighborhood is worth $30,000,000."
That's exactly how a "market cap" works.  It's just a made-up price based on the sale of a few marginal examples.  Now imagine Bill Gates comes to that neighborhood and announces he has a strong desire to buy every house that's currently for-sale there.  What do you think would suddenly happen to the price of those three houses?  Naturally they would rise.  And the rise would be pretty dramatic.  Each family living in those houses would immediately know they could get away with jacking up the asking-price of their home because they finally have an interested buyer (and he's rich).   The higher sale-price of those three houses would make the value of those other 97 homes skyrocket because the market assumption is that if those other people put their homes on the market, Bill will swoop in and buy them (thus keeping the market elevated).
So this same marginal price-formation is what's going on with Bitcoin (and any traded commodity or stock or currency).  The Bitcoins that are being traded form the price for the rest of the Bitcoins that **aren't** being traded.  And the funny thing is, there are many more of the latter - it's like an iceberg.  Only a few coins are exposed to the market (less than 1% are for sale at any given moment).  But what if that suddenly turned to 3%?  In that case, the market would be flooded with "for-sale" Bitcoins, and the demand wouldn't be able to keep up.  That would knock the price down for every Bitcoin in existence (even the not-for-sale Bitcoins).
So now you see that $7 billion never actually existed.  It was just a shorthand way of saying what Bitcoin is "worth" overall.
Here's a relevant video you might enjoy:  
So now you see why it's ridiculous when people say a rich person (or government) could by "every single Bitcoin" for $7 billion.  That's simply not true.  By the time they buy the "for-sale" Bitcoins, it would completely deplete the market of available Bitcoins and drive the price of all of them sky-high (into $100,000's of thousands of dollars each).  It isn't possible to "buy every Bitcoin", just like it's not possible to "buy every pair of pants" - the price will rise as you're buying them.  The key phrase to remember (if you want to impress your friends with economic jargon) is:  **"Price is formed at the margin."**

It's pseudonymous.  You can use stealth addresses and coinjoin to conceal which addresses you control.

Right.  Well the State is really just another predator, like lions or mosquitoes.  Humans have had many adversities over the last couple hundred thousand years, and we use technology to overcome them.
Using fire to cook food allowed us to get more calories out of eating less stuff, because it softened things and kept us warm.
Agriculture allowed us to remain stationary rather than nomadic.
Writing and press allowed us to communicate complex and abstract ideas.
Bitcoin is really the fruition of the Internet - a network that allows very low cost publishing and value storage/transfer.
So I think what we'll see going forward is taxation and censorship being treated very similarly - they are both a form of censorship, and technology will discover new ways to route around them.  The state will shrivel and ultimately die.

I wouldn't invest more than 15% of your portfolio in bitcoin (assuming you are starting out).  If your bitcoin allocation naturally grows, you can rebalance your portfolio to account for the change.  Some people have more than 90% of their savings in bitcoin, but typically this is only due to the fact it grew over the years and they want to avoid selling. 
I'd recommend buying once a month if you are dollar cost averaging into it. Always remember that the odds you'll buy at the lowest price possible are slim.  It would be a miracle if the price didn't fall lower after you buy, so don't get nervous or emotional if that happens.  Just assume it will happen from the start.

It's not possible to separate Bitcoin from libertarianism, sorry.
Bitcoin is fundamentally a libertarian technology, because it wouldn't exist today if it weren't decentralized.  Governments would have shut it down.  The only reason Bitcoin is so great for buying online and doing international money transfers is precisely because it bypasses government regulations so easily.
The only reason Bitcoin is desirable and has high demand is because it has a fixed supply, which is a libertarian ideal for money.

Bitcoin is a revolution for two key reasons:  international settlements/remittance and the protection of capital.  There are a bunch of other reasons Bitcoin is a wild invention, but those are the main ones.
Paying, consuming, buying... this is for fiat.  Sure, it's great that Bitcoin can excel in this *in certain ways and under certain circumstances*.  But that's not the point.  Any dolt can make a currency used for buying things.  Governments and banks are populated by dolts.

A bunch of traders borrowed money to buy Bitcoin, on the expectation the price would rise dramatically in the last few weeks.  It didn't, in fact it fell.  So as the price fell, the companies that loaned the traders money called them up and said "I see your trade isn't working.  I want you to close it and return my money now, with interest."
This is called a "margin call".
It forces traders to sell the BTC they purchased with borrowed money, and that forces the market even lower - which often triggers more margin calls among other traders.  So it's a cascading effect, where thousands of traders are forced to sell.
It is an artificial buying opportunity, if you believe in the long-term value of the Bitcoin network.

Colored coins are just tokens that can represent whatever the issuer wants them to represent.  They could be shares in a company, for instance.  The tokens are just 1 satoshi (1/100 millionth of a Bitcoin).
Smart contracts are contracts that are programmed to execute automatically when certain terms/conditions are met.  This makes them very powerful, because they aren't controlled by banks or governments.  They are the first contracts involving real money (Bitcoin) that are executed totally automatically without human intervention or interference.

Austrian economics describes a group of economists who believe in a certain type of economic analysis - praxeology (which is the logical study of human action).  It's complex, but basically it's the opposite of mainstream economics (aka "Keynesian" economics).  We are very pro-free market and we view prices as signals that guide production.  Government interference in prices (via taxation and regulations) is actually a type of censorship  that reduces the productivity and wealth of the society.  Keynesians view economics as more of a math problem, rather than an analysis of human action.
Famous Austrian economists are Ludwig von Mises, Carl Menger, Murray Rothbard, and Jorg Guido Hulsmann.


Yep, eventually people would just start to demand their salaries in Bitcoin rather than dollars, and many businesses would comply.  All fiat currencies are eventually destroyed by their issuing governments, because it's too tempting to print "free" money.

Your BTC, along with several other peoples' BTC, are funneled through a single transaction that has multiple inputs and outputs.  This way anyone observing the blockchain can't tell which output corresponds with which input.  It's similar to manual mixing, but it's trustless (meaning you don't need to trust the mixer to give you your BTC back at the end of the mixing process - the protocol itself does that in CoinJoin).

Using BTC to symbolize assets that exist off the blockchain introduces counterparty risk, thus making the blockchain superfluous for that purpose.  Remember that the blockchain's great contribution to money technology is being a zero trust system.

But decentralization and the health of the network is the only way to accomplish that longer term goal.  Market accountability is how we can force the mining pools to back off.

The laws weren't always there because Bitcoin wasn't always legally considered property or a currency.  For a very long time, it was just an internet point system.
@_date: 2014-06-23 04:31:32
Take a look at this:  
Notice that for every one Bitcoin purchased, there's one Bitcoin being sold - trade is reciprocal.
Hoarding (saving) is actually a good thing.  It's what gives a currency its value.  If everyone is always spending their money, the money becomes worthless because nobody wants it.  So the goal should be to get more people to save, because that increases the depth of the Bitcoin markets, and allows more capital (read:  value) to flow through them.  Currently the Bitcoin markets are actually rather shallow.  They only allow a dozen million dollars' worth of value to flow through per day.  With more hoarding, that number can skyrocket to billions of dollars per day.
@_date: 2014-05-09 20:56:53


There is an incentive to destroy alt coins - it helps Bitcoin's network effect.

But this is a fallacy.  Economics functions because of specialization and differentiation.  Different people have different preferences at different times.  If everyone agreed on everything all the time, prices wouldn't exist -it would be impossible to have specialization and differentiation.

You're desperate to prove your point, but I think any fair-minded person can see that it's a flawed premise.  There was a reasonable expectation that the IRS could have determined Bitcoin was a foreign currency, hence why the IRS issued a clarifying statement.

Right, but the inflation is already known by the market at-large, so it is information that's already priced-in.  The same can't be said for fiat, because the central banks don't want their activities to be known by the market in advance (otherwise they'd have no power over interest rates).

As to why the 51% "problem" isn't fixed sooner:  none of the proposed solutions actually solve it.

This is a **major** problem people have understanding money and why it has value.
Money doesn't simply have value because "enough people believe they do".  Money has value because it has these properties:
1.  Highly divisible
2.  Difficult to counterfeit
3.  Easy to send
4.  Easy to store (ie non-degradable)
5.  Easy to measure &amp; verify (accounting, assay)
6.  Somewhat limited in supply
7.  Easy to secure
Bitcoin excels in all these categories, which makes it the best money humans have ever used.  Over time, more and more market participants will recognize these facts and convert a portion of their capital into BTC.

First I'd get in touch with someone there who's willing to buy that many BTC from you.  Next you just buy the BTC (and maybe a little extra in case the price declines somewhat), and keep them in the online wallet app (circle and coinbase both have good online wallets that also feature smartphone apps).  Upon arriving in Argentina, find the guy who wants to buy the BTC and he'll show you the QR code for his Bitcoin address.  After he's handed you the cash, scan the code with your phone and transfer the BTC to him.

Well consider something simple like gold:  if you want to secure it, you have to buy a safe.  The money you would spend on buying the safe is money you had to earn.  Earning it requires effort, time.  That's time and effort you could have used to learn to make a secure offline paper wallet.
So really, Bitcoin is still much cheaper to secure than any other form of money.  People need to be willing to learn if they want to participate in this new network.

The graph is plainly wrong.  It's easy to prove why:  the number of transactions per day is near the peak, and the price is currently over $300.  Therefore we should expect to see the 70,000 transactions per day x $330 = $23,100,000 dollars moved per day.
Back in June of last year, there were 24,000 transactions per day.  Multiply that by the price then ($125) and you get $3,000,000 dollars moved per day.  Approx. 1/7th of the current level.
$18,000,000 vs. $45,000,000 is what your graph shows, which is only an increase of 2.5x since June.
So the graph is simply wrong.  Unless you can show where my math is off.

Well there are ways to break up the blockchain and have a distributed network of trust.  For instance, programmers are currently working on ways to have each user download a few blocks (rather than the entire blockchain), and act as nodes for those specific blocks.
Bitcoin doesn't **require** zero-trust, and indeed Bitcoin isn't currently a zero-trust system (because we often rely on miners to tell the truth and submit valid blocks).  So having distributed trust is just as effective for our purposes.
I think moving forward, you'll see a combination of zero-trust, distributed-trust, and semi-decentralized servers.  Chris Odom does a good job talking about this and his Open Transactions project is a great example of this in action.  It's very likely that in the future, most transactions with Bitcoin will happen off the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-05-26 22:15:19

What you're describing is a hardware problem more than a software problem.  I have no doubt that eventually every transaction will be on the block chain, but that likely won't happen for thirty years.
In meantime, Bitcoin is still transformative for multiple reasons.  One of which is the ability of anyone to participate in finance without needing permission from a government.  That's huge.  Even with severely limited block space, banks are now open to competition.

Eh, the comparison lacks because under certain circumstances, actively managed mutual funds do beat the market.  Granted, the circumstances are less-common, but the market participants aren't experts.  They're relying on trusted third parties like brokerage firms to recommend funds to them.  But if you look at the mutual fund industry over the last 15 years, you'll see a gradual transition away from these actively managed funds as the  market adjusts to recognize this fact.
Derivatives aren't a market that's used by retail investors.  They are functionally used by professional traders and international corporations.

@_date: 2014-02-26 22:41:16


Sure, depending on the interest rate.  There are probably some people who would prefer to let me borrow their BTC at an interest rate that corresponds with their own opinion of Bitcoin's future value.  For instance:  if someone thinks Bitcoin is currently undervalued, rather than simply sitting on their BTC they could instead loan it out to someone who thinks it's currently overvalued.
Same applies for USD.
Simple calculation of risk and expectations.


Yes, because we could agree to a contract that takes into account our expectations of Bitcoin's future value.  So for instance, I could agree to pay someone 1 BTC per month of their labor for the next 12 months, and that might end up being a very fair deal for many people.

It's really just a debate between centralization and decentralization.  So the government and federal reserve are centralized institutions, and they want to have the power to control all trading. We've seen throughout history that centralizing power like this is very dangerous, because it usually ends up impoverishing and killing people.  Basically it's "putting all your eggs in one basket".
Decentralized systems are better because they enable free trade without permission from elites.  This makes people richer and balances the power between the little guy and the big banks (who are all in bed with the federal reserve).
A long time ago, it was easy for the elites to control the flow of information because printing books and pamphlets was expensive.  The Gutenburg Press massively reduced that expense, giving birth to a huge explosion of progress and general knowledge and literacy.  Then the internet reduced publishing costs even more, and millions of people can read a blogger's post for free. 
Bitcoin is having this same effect on money.  Transactions can no longer be censored by elites. And that will help humanity going forward.

Both the methods you cited would be flagrant violations of the Constitution and engender mass anger at banks.  It would also create a Streisand Effect around Bitcoin, giving it a "forbidden fruit" element.  Transactions would continue in other countries and on the black market in the US.  The price would continue to rise as it's used more-and-more in the informal economy.  Drug cartels would adopt it for settling debts and transferring capital across borders.
It's really too late to stop it at this stage.  I think the government could have stopped it last year, but the hash rate and global spread are too great now.  And keep in mind that Western Democracies have an image to uphold - banning Bitcoin would be taking off the mask and exposing fascism, which could cause some serious anger at the government as it destroys billions of dollars worth of value.

It means you can have two (or more) private keys, and that more than one private key would be needed to spend Bitcoins from an address.
This means you could have a scenario where you give one private key to your brother and keep one private key yourself, and the only way to be able to spend the money would be if both you and your brother agreed to spend it (because you'd need both keys to spend it).
This allows for new contracts to exist without the need for governments and judges - it's all based on math.

Right, but his options for obtaining the money are plenty - there are numerous people all trying to get rid of their money, so he will accept the trades involving higher and higher nominal amounts of the currency (thus devaluing the currency over time).
@_date: 2014-08-11 00:55:29
That's a major reason for it, yes.  But there's also the political and psychological reasons for it.
1.  Politically speaking, being the creator of Bitcoin makes you a target for governments and various personal attacks on your integrity/private life.
2.  Psychologically, it's much easier for the masses to accept a currency that magically sprang into existence than a currency that was initially owned by one man.  If Bitcoin became "Adam Back's Internet Money" (just tossed his name in there as an example), it would be a tougher sell.  The Satoshi Nakamoto mystery makes it more palatable to new investors.

I just wanted to commend you for this excellent response.  Sometimes advances in technology seem rather mundane at first, because it's difficult for people to imagine all the potential use cases.
A great example of this is text messages - why should anyone care about the ability to send a limited (160 character) message to others when cell phones already allow us to literally *talk to them*?  Technically, text messages are a step backward.
And yet they are incredibly popular and useful.  In fact, people often send and receive more texts than they do actual phone calls.

Well keep in mind that governments don't have a good track record.  In just the last century alone they've killed hundreds of millions of people - their own customers!
Have private businesses killed that many people?
If I had a simple choice between a government protecting me, and a private business protecting me, can you see why I'd choose the private business?


I disagree that governments are held accountable.  They aren't subject to market discipline - taxpayers should be given a choice about whether they support specific government programs or not.


Chaos is beautiful.  Chaos is how progress happens - every day, millions of people interacting in peaceful ways to produce goods and services for each other.  No government organizes this.  It's organized by the free market.  This is called "emergent order".  


Democracy actually leads to terrible outcomes for many people.  Most of the brutal dictators throughout history are loved by their citizens - Hitler, Kim Jong Il, Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao, etc.
Democracy isn't safe for minorities or people who own property - it is a form of communism, where everyone's property is always potentially up for grabs.

"Monetary policy" doesn't exist.  It's just a trick.  Inflation is a type of taxation that helps the elites and hurts the common man. 
What you're asking is really the nexus between academics, economics, politics, and propaganda.  That's why the answers you're getting seem strange / ridiculous / biased.  But the truth is simple to identify if you acknowledge that the common man will naturally choose to hold a fixed-supply currency rather than an inflating one.  This is why you see bitcoin's price going up (on average).  The market is slowly leaving fiat currency and moving into bitcoin.  The process will speed up in the next several years. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 05:14:10
You can build debt on top of Bitcoin, but you can't do fractional reserve lending with Bitcoin because a Bitcoin token won't be worth as much as an actual on-the-blockchain Bitcoin.  Also the blockchain's nature makes it easy for anyone to check the reserves of any business or bank.

The Bitcoin network doesn't need to grow in order for the user base and market capitalization to grow.  It is currently sufficient for decentralized, accountable global trade.

Companies could issue shares on the blockchain, but keep in mind that it sort of defeats the purpose of a blockchain to begin with - by adding the element of trust to the ownership.

People will say, "Don't turn this into generational conflict!  Some baby boomers are good!  You're just dividing people!"  And it's true, some baby boomers are fine.  Some were libertarians who didn't want to go along with this disgusting debt fueled financial system.
But the mass of the Boomers, the majority, fired the first shot.  They are the ones who started this attack on their own offspring.  They are the ones who became obsessed with debt, leverage, risk, unnecessary complexity, abdication of responsibility, and a foolish trashing of the values that made early America great and **different** from other nations.  They're the ones who let the military industrial complex not only grind up their children, but *their friends and peers, as well*.  They did it while singing hymns and dreaming of a retirement with a 6000 square foot beach house and Sunday morning bike rides like you see in the constant drug commercials today.
No, a college education doesn't necessarily entail a good job.  Neither does hard work, when you live in a shitty, hollowed out gourd of an economy.
But these mental midgets blew their children's future inheritance on four year degrees in literature and philosophy.  And even if they had the foresight to save, it's not like it would matter anyway - inheritance is "unethical", they tell us.  They preach to us about how much they "care about the poor", and how we have to "do our fair share" to help.
Then they cut a check to ISIS in Syria and bitch that Bitcoin is financing terrorism.

I'd suggest reading "Human Action" by Ludwig von Mises if you want a better understanding of economics.  The only thing that changes the value of a good/service/commodity is a shift in the supply/demand nexus.  Doesn't matter where the shift comes from.
A lot of people complain that Bitcoin is being "hoarded rather than spent", and a lot of people complain that Bitcoin is being "immediately sold by businesses, rather than saved".  The critics are trying to have it both ways.  In truth, it doesn't matter who does the hoarding and who does the spending (or even what they buy - whether it be a laptop on NewEgg or a bunch of dollars on Coinbase).

No, just the opposite.  But it doesn't halve, either.  The price starts reacting months (years?) before the halving, and that has an effect on mining hash rate long before the actual event.  I don't view the halving as a particularly drastic thing, in the context of the larger market for BTC.

I would trust someone who has experience and good reputation to do that - in the case of governments, I don't have a choice as to which ones serve my needs.  They force their "services" on me, and force me to pay for them (whatever price they choose).


I actually agree with you that central banks were necessary to have digital currency prior to Bitcoin, and that markets naturally gravitate toward digital currency even though metals like gold and silver have no counterparty risk.  The reasons for that are the fact digital money excels in transfer, accounting, etc. and this comes across as lower transaction costs.


Hm, it's interesting you chose public schools as your example.  It's pretty common knowledge that homeschooled children vastly outperform public schooled children in standardized tests.  It's also pretty common knowledge that American public schools are in decline, and have been for a while.


What foreign invaders?  With the advent of nuclear weapons, and high personal gun ownership rates, a standing army really isn't necessary in the modern world (unless you are building an empire for the elites...).


You mean the rule of police and judges, who are both on the state's payroll.  The millions of peaceful people incarcerated in US prisons for decades on end would like to have a word with you.

Yes, a QR code is standard.  You can generate secure offline Bitcoin wallets by downloading  and then running it in a browser while your computer is disconnected from the Internet.  Wiggle your mouse around (or roll dice) to generate randomness, and then print out the wallets it generates from that.  Only reconnect to the Internet when you're done printing and have closed the browser.  Lastly, send the BTC to the addresses you've printed.  You can do this using a webcam or smartphone camera.  Be sure you only scan the address and not the private key - once the private key has been scanned, it's no longer "virgin", so it's not secure anymore.

The problem is, there is no evidence they're capable of doing this.  All the best minds in computer science (at least in this particular field) are currently working on Bitcoin.  And anything remotely centralized by banks will just be ignored by the market in favor of the more-free Bitcoin network.

They're either taking the loss, or they have cheaper electricity than you realize.  Maybe they're generating their own electricity, or selling the heat byproduct of the ASICs somehow.  Or they're just holding out for higher prices, hoping they'll rise soon before they are forced to cut off their chips!  We can't know what miners are thinking at any given moment, and mining is a speculative activity anyway.


Well it's similar to the regular economy - wealth naturally accumulates into a few elites' hands.  That's nothing to be worried about, especially in the case of Bitcoin, because unlike with other currencies, the rich in Bitcoin aren't able to print more money.  Once they spend it, it's gone.  The price pullbacks are good for the "little guy" who wants to own more BTC, because now he can afford more.


Don't worry about transaction numbers so much as actual applications.  Ideally we'd expect to see transactions double every two years on average, but that's just my personal guess.  Remember that a lot of transactions are happening "off chain", so they aren't being recorded.


MtGox by itself can't create value where there is none.  No exchange can do that.
@_date: 2015-01-05 05:14:07
Banks can only buy the bitcoins that are currently for sale, and when those are gone, the rest of the coins will skyrocket in price.  So they could never buy them all.
@_date: 2014-07-13 05:48:22
Not millions per block yet, but it can process thousands per block with current infrastructure, which is enough for intra-bank settlements.  So it could scale globally, but most people wouldn't be using Bitcoin directly.  Instead, they'd be using tokens "backed" by Bitcoins, and banks would be incentivized via the market to prove they have full reserves at all times.  (Notice:  this is **a lot** easier than proving full reserves of gold or cash.)  Settlements between banks could occur frequently, like once a day.

Ultimately it will boil down to people using it to save.  They won't save a hundred percent in Bitcoin, just a small amount at first.  As new users join the network it'll deflate further, and people will get excited (hype cycles).  So the money use is the most important by far, other uses for the technology will be secondary.  My personal guess is the blockchain will mainly be used to authenticate people in a secure way.

I don't the the masses will invest in Bitcoin right off the bat, but institutions will.  Sort of like most commodities today.  The thing I'm most looking forward to is more places to spend/exchange BTC in other countries, ATMs in/near major cities, etc.  Basically just more acceptance.

While I agree with most of this, it overlooks the revolutionary economic implications of the Bitcoin currency.  Yes, it's fun to talk about "applications built on top of the block chain".  But the fact of the matter is, none of these applications have had nearly the degree of success as Bitcoin itself.  Mastercoin, NXT, etc. have flopped.  I think it's time for people to start asking themselves why that is.

Money doesn't move slowly.  This is one of the first things you learn as a trader - when money smells profit potential, it floods in as quickly as possible.
Just because Bitcoin is on the investment community's radar doesn't mean they view it as a safe investment yet, and it certainly doesn't mean they understand it.  These are finance and banking guys in their 40's and 50's and 60's.  They are still using Windows XP.  They have no idea how to store BTC.

Naw, it's not possible.  Remember what shorting is:  it's when a trader borrows BTC and immediately sells it, then waits while the price falls and buys it back at a lower price (in order to return the borrowed BTC to the lender).
So in order to "close out" a short position, a trader has to buy back the BTC.  The act of buying them back creates added demand and drives the price higher.  So it's a closed loop.  Short sellers can have an effect in the short term, but not the long term.
@_date: 2015-01-03 05:43:57
Sure, but it's not the best way to do it.  Plus there's really no need for it - torrents are resilient even without a blockchain.  The Bitcoin tech is used to coordinate a large number of users so they are simultaneously in agreement about something (in this case, who owns what).  So it's great for anything involving property rights and proof of identity/existence.  Other than that, it's not really necessary.  90% of the time when you hear people talking about "blockchain technology", they're just using it as a buzzword to hype something that doesn't really need it, and isn't really useful.

Just install Electrum.  It doesn't require the whole blockchain to work.
Scalability isn't an issue for a number of reasons.  The most important is:  even today, Bitcoin is cheaper to operate than the traditional banking system.  Think about how much it costs to run a bank every day.  You have to pay employees (each branch has at least three), mortgage on the building/vault, electricity, etc.  That's hundreds of thousands of dollars per year, per branch.  And there are a dozen branches in each town.

Yes, fiat is a centralized faith-based ledger system.
Bitcoin is a decentralized proof-of-work based ledger system.
The only reason Bitcoin is possible is because of (relatively) recent advances in computer and internet technology - prior to the year 2000 or so, blockchains, mining, and bandwidth would've made Bitcoin basically too intensive to be reasonable.  But today, thousands of gigabytes are cheap and high speed internet is proliferated.
So we no longer need private ledger money.

Don't think of bitcoins as discrete objects, think of them as one giant file (the blockchain).  The file is a mathematically verifiable ledger that is impossible to cheat.
The best video is "Bitcoin under the hood" which you can find on YouTube.  To make a Bitcoin account, you simply run a program that takes random number input (like from wiggling your mouse around, or dice rolls) and uses that number to generate a mathematically-paired address and key.  You can see an example of this happening at   Try it yourself!
Notice this is unlike making an email address and password, because you don't get to choose your terms.  It spits out randomness.  The reason for this is:  Bitcoin isn't a company like Google or Yahoo.  So it can't remember your password for you (this would be dangerous, because any employee could take your money).  Check out this video to better understand the public address / private key mathematical relationship:

Gold, silver, etc. already had this.  Bitcoin's advantages are lower costs associated with storage, transactions, etc. and the programmable nature.  Fiat money has those features, too.  Bitcoin adds the limited supply aspect.

Yes, I completely understand.  When people first hear about Bitcoin, they often wonder:  "Why would I need this?  We already have digital money.  And it's relatively stable.  And I hardly ever send money overseas.  What's the purpose?"
There are several dynamics at play that make Bitcoin a "Big Deal".  Learning about them and understanding them is tricky.  It's not for the layperson.  The layperson only buys into new technology when it's already ubiquitous.  They're the last people on-board.
It's similar to email in that regard - "Why do I need to send people email?  I can already send people letters in the mail.  And I can call them on the phone if I want to talk to them immediately.  Plus, none of my friends have email addresses - only geeks and professors have them.  And who wants to spend $1000 on a computer and hundreds more on a modem to access the Internet?

If you sold one Bitcoin for $1, then for a fraction of a second the price of all Bitcoins would technically be $1.  But it would immediately bounce back up to whatever it was trading at prior to your sale.
Moral of the story:  the market is at the mercy of what traders are doing at any particular moment.  But price isn't value.  Even if the government slammed the price down, it would only be temporary and Bitcoin would "rise from the dead" as people started trading it again.  Remember that it got its start with a price of zero.  People naturally traded it up in price, thus it has real value.

The idea is that people will gradually lose confidence in the fiat currencies and move a portion of their savings into Bitcoin as a hedge.  Eventually the hedge becomes the main currency through speculative attacks by traders (where they borrow fiat in order to buy Bitcoin, thus destroying the value of the fiat and pumping up the value of Bitcoin).  This isn't a smooth process, and would require a lot of booms and busts over a period of time.

It's not possible to "back" a digital token with a physical commodity, because any peg in value is because of a promise - the promise of the issuer to redeem the token for the physical commodity.  But humans have this nasty habit of breaking their promises.  ;)  So Bitcoin solves this by having zero counterparty risk.  It's traded openly, just like marijuana or oil or gold, and the market naturally arrives at a price based on supply and demand.

Money is valuable because it's a relatively neutral asset without many other uses.  You have to understand what counterparty risk is, and what a "bearer asset" is.

One of the primary uses of money is as a neutral store of value, so investors in Bitcoin are actually using it.  By holding it, they are granting it life.  Without investors, it would be worthless and thus incapable of transferring value at all.  Holders are rewarded for their risk taking via the return over time.

Money velocity for Bitcoin will naturally be lower than fiat on average because of the lower inflation.  The price could only remain the same if everyone using Bitcoin was uninterested in also making a profit on it.  Humans don't behave that way.

Depends where you are, converting Bitcoin to fiat is easier/difficult based on that.  Look to see if any businesses or restaurants in your area accept Bitcoin and see if they'll just give you cash for it.

Bitcoin, like gold, makes you sovereign over your personal savings.  But unlike gold Bitcoin has 100x lower transaction costs and hasn't yet saturated the market.  So if you understand the marginal utility of a fixed supply global currency, which also acts as a bearer instrument, then you'll invest a portion of your savings in Bitcoin for the long term.

The only way to depreciate a currency is to create more of it, and that produces a Cantillion effect where the issuer is effectively confiscating wealth from the currency holders.  Inflating the currency by giving equal, and proportionate amounts to each user would be effectively the same as changing where the decimal place is - none at all.
So there is no way to **genuinely** shift the value of a token in either direction, without destroying the neutrality of its distribution ratio (and thus causing systemic risk).

Nope, it's not necessary.  There are "light wallets" that only download the headers of each block (an extremely small amount of data) and they can be used to broadcast and confirm transactions quickly.  Full nodes and miners are the only people who need to have access to the full blockchain, and for various reasons the size of the blockchain won't be an issue going forward.


No, because it's possible to confirm the validity of a transaction without the transaction appearing in the blockchain yet.  Your computer can just look at the signature and that will mathematically prove the correct private key was used to sign the transaction (and for the amount stated).  Once the transaction is "broadcast" to the nodes, it's only a matter of time until it's published in a forthcoming block.  So the odds of a "double spend" happening are extremely low (and you can minimize that risk by ensuring the person sending you funds includes a decent-sized miner's fee).  The only time you'd want to sit around for several blocks is when you're making a large transaction (several thousand dollars worth or more).


It depends on the type of attack.  But the beauty of Bitcoin is that each block acts as a kind of "save point", like in a videogame.  So if there is a worst-case-scenario where someone figures out how to completely compromise the encryption, we'd at least still have the transaction history prior to their attack, and so in theory we could figure out a way to port the blockchain to a different type of validating server network.  But that's a big "if".  People trust Bitcoin as much as they trust the encryption techniques underlying it, which are military-grade.  And they've been around a long time.
My recommendation is to assume a 50/50 outcome for your investment, no matter how enthusiastic or cautious you are.  This is a moon shot, so it'll either completely blow up (I personally find this unlikely) or it'll become very, very popular.

So let's think about this logically.
Basically you're claiming that governments didn't think anonymity, extremely cheap transactions to anyone in the world, fixed supply, zero cost storage, and decentralization (ie impossibility of government control) were desirable traits for a currency to have.
**Of course** these things are desirable traits for a currency!  It's a no-brainer.  Are you saying that Bitcoin just woke everyone up to this fact?  Why do you think governments require people to give over identifying information to open a bank account?


Okay, so we've been over this before, but I'll repeat it since you don't appear to be absorbing the information:  what you are describing introduces counterparty risk.  Do you know what counterparty risk is?
I don't care if Jesus Christ himself backs a currency.  It's still not as good as owning the **actual commodity** that the currency represents.


It's not possible for something to have a "set price".  Markets determine price, not issuers.
And it's also not possible for one thing to be "backed" by another thing.

Depends on what country you're in.  Don't bother mining unless you have millions to throw at it.  I'd recommend starting out by purchasing some BTC on Coinbase.com or Circle.com.  The latter allows you to get them instantly with a credit card (usually), while Coinbase takes a few days to connect to your bank account.
Once you have them, learn how to use ChangeTip, and how to make your own offline paper wallets using dice.  It's pretty neat stuff.

I'd recommend installing MultiBit as your first computer wallet.  
It will assign you an address to start with, and you can send some bits to it (or have other people send bits by pasting your address on here).
You can buy Bitcoins on  or 
Remember that Bitcoin is basically one giant ledger file.  So when you send bits back and forth between addresses, all you're really doing is editing the ledger (which your wallet programs reference to see which private key controls those bits).

@_date: 2015-01-06 02:58:03
Well this is a hard question to answer because we've only had paper currencies being widely used for a couple hundred years, and we've only had digital currencies for a few decades.  So Bitcoin is the first fixed supply digital currency, and we'll see how the market responds to that over the next few decades.
Average historic rate of *interest* is around 5%, so there's that.  The British pound is commonly considered to be the most successful fiat currency of all time, in terms of how long it's been around without collapsing.  Typical lifespan of a fiat currency is 28 years or so (large nations and empires tend to be exceptions to this, but not always).

Fiat currencies have value because they are the only tokens you can legally pay your taxes with.  That's an effect of "legal tender laws".  
Bitcoin has value for similar reasons precious metals did/do:  They have good physical properties that make them well suited to being money.  Those properties are:  easy to store, divide, measure, send, receive, verify, hide, transport, recombine...difficult to counterfeit, inflate, steal, track, dilute.
Ultimately Bitcoin will take on a market capitalization comparable or greater than gold.
@_date: 2015-01-07 02:59:45
You can, but those offline coins aren't budging until you import the private key to an internet connected device.  The reason people keep some BTC online is because they are trading with them, or they don't constitute a high percentage of their total holdings (so a hack wouldn't be catastrophic).
There are hardware wallets (like Trezor) that allow you to have offline storage that you can spend from, so it's the best of both worlds.  You'll see people shifting to that more in the future.

Yeah, you wouldn't be affected.  You'd "lock in" the price at the time of the purchase.
EDIT:  to be clear, I mean that you'd still get the $ amount of BTC you purchased.  So if the BTC price collapses, you'd still get $5 worth of BTC at the time you redeem your coupon.  You wouldn't get ripped off.

I once lost 50 BTC on blockchain.info because of a mistake I made involving a mixer transaction (this was a while ago, when 50 BTC was only like $300).  I sent them an email expecting them to say it was gone forever, but they sent me 50 BTC within a couple hours.
Coinbase refused a couple of my orders saying they were "high risk", but I emailed them and they went back and honored the original price.

Couple things:  this relied on banks and individuals to honestly report how much gold they had, and it is easier to seize a physical asset than a digital/encrypted asset.  It's also easier to leave the country with bitcoins than with stacks of gold coins.
@_date: 2015-01-05 01:59:42
The number of bitcoins created (released?) per day/year isn't directly related to how much power is thrown at mining, because the network adjusts the time between blocks every couple weeks to compensate for rises and falls in the total hash rate.  The miners fees are separate from block rewards.

This is what I've been saying, but more comprehensive and better-written.  People need to calm down about blockchain crowding.  Yes, it will happen eventually.  But we don't need to preempt it.
We should also learn to embrace off-chain transactions.  No, it's not the end of decentralization.  There can still be frequent digital audits and other mechanisms for keeping transaction processors honest (like side chains &amp; Open Transactions' "voting pools", etc.)
Everybody take a deep breath, calm down, and remember that Bitcoin isn't (and never has been) competing directly with PayPal or VISA.  That's the job of the off-chain services.  And I'm confident they'll do it with flying colors.  Just give it time!

Because Bitcoin settlement can occur in an anonymous, unregulated environment (unlike digital fiat), the price of off-chain transactions will always remain low.  It's very exciting to think about.
@_date: 2015-05-31 14:18:16
It's not a weakness, it's a strength.  You don't want a system that's easy to change.  Most transactions can occur off-chain.  And that's okay.
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:48:53
Correct, and the number of users.
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:26:49
Bitcoin is like a yardstick for measuring and exchanging value.  The total number of "inches" on the yardstick maxes out at 21 million.  If you compare that to other money, it has an advantage because other digital currencies aren't capped in the same way.
So if you want to hold Bitcoin for the long term, you might end up doing fairly well.  But if you need to access your funds now, it would make sense to sell.  Depends on your time horizon.

Nope.  Look up Konrad Graf's paper on Bitcoin and where its value comes from.  It's a long read, but totally worth it.
Basically any token that's useful as money will eventually obtain value naturally, because the market seeks out these kinds of tokens to store and transfer value (money is a tool, like a hammer).
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:47:41

How Bitcoin Works in 5 Minutes (Technical): 
If you want to understand Bitcoin, first you must understand two basic concepts.  The first is public/private key cryptography.  The second is proof of work.
Here's a video to help you understand the mathematical relationship between Bitcoin addresses and the private keys that correspond to those addresses:  Public Key Cryptography: Diffie-Hellman Key Excha…: 
Proof of work is basically a way to force computers to expend electricity.  "Why would anyone want to do that?"  Because it makes spamming harder.  If it was possible to send millions of emails every second, spam would be proliferated too quickly to control.  So by forcing computers to solve difficult math problems, you can slow down their ability to do a certain task.  In the case of Bitcoin, that task is verifying the blocks.

Short term traders.  When it comes to price, long term investors have little effect (except when they make large one-off purchases).
The Bitcoin price will continue to fall until all the "for sale" coins are snatched up by holders.  When that happens, the trend will reverse.  But traders may try to test for a new bottom multiple times.
@_date: 2015-01-05 01:23:06
It's possible, but I'm a bit of a cynic lately.  Maybe NASDAQ will approve it and the price will immediately drop to $165 in reaction.  ;)

Safety is relative.  If you have $5,000,000 of Bitcoin in a single address and it's connected to the internet, it'll be like a juicy steak for hackers.  But if you have $50 on your Android phone, it'll probably be fine.  Keep any excess BTC in "cold storage" or on a system with two-factor authentication.  Circle has this feature.
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:36:45
Well this is sometimes referred to as "pegging" the price, and its not possible in the long term because markets are filled with self interested individuals.  So they'll eventually break their promise and that creates a cascade of selling until the coin reaches its true value.

I believe the buy/sell is typically around 1% for Coinbase, Circle and most other brokers.  Exchanges like Bitstamp and Bitfinex may charge less for funding and withdrawing, but you should ask about that as I'm not a trader.
Sending your money to the broker shouldn't cost anything unless it's a huge amount - they usually just take it directly from your account like PayPal would.
Transferring from one Bitcoin address to another will be about 4 or 5 cents, if you want a fast confirmation.  Otherwise be prepared to wait a few blocks.
Withdrawing USD (I assume you mean selling Bitcoins) will also incur a ~1% fee with brokers.

Just because a government shouts really loudly, "THIS IS WORTH LESS BECAUSE I SAID SO!!" doesn't actually make it true.  There's always someone, somewhere in the world who doesn't give a damn.  "Blacklisted" Bitcoins will simply be bid up again to their natural par value.

Upvoted for the perspective.  It's interesting to see the criticisms laid out in such a way, because it emphasizes the fact that they are centered around personalities.  Bitcoin and central banking aren't personalities.  They are very real things, and they are fundamentally at odds with each other.

It would defeat the purpose of Bitcoin, because you need to look at the blockchain to make sure the paper wallet actually has the key for BTC, then you need to move them to an address the other person doesn't have access to.

It's an online currency that's traded like a stock.  So the value sometimes goes up and down (although lately it has been coming down).  You can buy and sell bitcoins, or simply hold onto them for the long term.  The goal is to have it replace credit cards for online purchases and international money transfers.  The infrastructure (exchanges, ATMs, etc) are still being built and expanded.

While I agree with everything else you said, I'm kind of skeptical about the ETF these days.  I think it's better to just assume two things:  The ETF won't be approved, and if it is, it won't measurably affect the price.

Well to an extent.  Think of it this way:  there are two types of precious metals, those that are above ground and those that are still trapped underground.  It's only economical to dig up the underground metals when the price goes high enough to justify that expense.  But once they are above ground, they needn't be dug up again - that's a 'sunk cost'.
Bitcoin is a little different in that it doesn't matter how valuable or cheap it is.  Miners will still produce the same, regularly scheduled number of BTC each block.

I've read some similar version of this spiel every day for the last 2 years.  It's still misguided.  Bitcoin isn't for casual spending.  It's not for the average Joe (yet).  Bitcoin is for very specific marginal use cases. And there's nothing wrong with that.
For the network infrastructure to fill out, we don't need to convince high school kids to buy pizza with Bitcoin.  We need more marginal use cases.  That means convenient international money transfer, larger investment from risk-tolerant institutions, online gambling, better online drug markets, better escrow services, smaller margins on fiat conversions.
This will all happen anyway, but the process has been delayed by the unwarranted attention given to "Bitcoin 2.0" projects like Ethereum, Mastercoin, etc.

Correct, it's not important to the value of Bitcoin.  Notice most of the price appreciation has occurred prior to merchant adoption.

Merchant adoption has little to no effect on the price.  I know that's heresy to say around here, but it's the goddamn truth.  The ability to spend isn't what makes Bitcoin interesting or useful.  Any currency can be used for that purpose.

There's a widespread misconception that if it weren't for governments, we'd all be using gold and silver coins as money.  That's nonsense.  Fiat currency won in the market for money, because it's much easier to store, transfer, count, and verify.

Secular deflation (falling prices) is a good thing.  What you're worried about is deflation of a debt-based money (fiat).  That is bad because it collapses the government bond market, and thus the currency with it. 
Bitcoin isn't backed by a government or a bond market, so deflation helps it.

I think if you asked people if they'd rather have a fixed supply currency or a growing supply, the majority would agree a growing supply is better for the economy and more fair to late adopters (minorities, women).  Bitcoin is a democratic currency, the world's first.  Let's keep it that way.

Well it's not that dangerous if you're hedged.  For instance, if I had a business that stored and earned profits as BTC, I might buy a derivatives contract that nullifies the gains/losses from the BTC market.

Price discovery is the process of people basically feeling around for bottoms and tops.  You can think of it like a blind man trying to find his way through a maze.  There's also an emotional component to it, which makes it even more indirect and irrational.
Essentially buyers of Bitcoin aren't overwhelmingly convinced we've hit the bottom yet, or plumbed the depths for long enough.  When the mass psychology changes on that, the next uptrend will start.

There are currently only a few million users of Bitcoin (and probably only 1 million of those are active).
So in order to cancel out that $1.45 million worth of fresh BTC, you'd really only need each active user buying less than $2 worth of BTC per day.  Not much at all.
The price will go up when it goes up.  It's somewhat of a feedback loop.  Traders are just testing the bottom now, and the weak hands are getting knocked off the bull.
@_date: 2014-11-17 20:13:40
Check your assumptions.  Mining isn't always as profitable as investors expect it to be, and sometimes it's more profitable than expected.  Mining is always implicitly a bet on the future price of Bitcoin, so timing matters.  Sometimes money is better spent stockpiling new hardware and sometimes it's better spent running electricity through existing hardware.
This is why mining pools will always be in flux, and no one pool will have a permanent advantage over the others.

1.  It's not necessarily easier to use because it requires you to write down a set of 12 words 3 separate times instead of simply printing them.  It also requires you to ensure your phone is never compromised, which is arguably more difficult than keeping your computer safe (someone could snatch your phone while it's unlocked).  And it requires you to manually send your address to yourself via a social media app or email if you want to not have to manually type it out onto a computer.
2.  That 0.5% of security (it's probably less) doesn't matter to 99.9% of Bitcoin newbies.

That's one way to engender confidence in a currency.  Heh.
@_date: 2015-08-03 05:42:36
Same thing that determines the price of dollars (as measured in other currencies or goods/services).  Prices are just ratios.  It's what people are willing to trade for a certain amount of a currency.
Traders buy and sell currencies at exchanges, and their bid/ask spreads determine the "price".
@_date: 2015-08-07 20:39:54
Could somebody send this guy a link to Carl Menger's paper on the origin of money?
So many people think they are providing some amazing insight when they yammer about money being "imaginary" or whatever, but they're only further misleading people about the actual reason it has value.  They might as well be saying TV is only entertaining because everybody agrees we're watching people instead of pixels.
Money has value because it is a signaling network.  Just like the internet.  Except instead of sending and storing pussy videos, money sends and stores reputation for adding value.
@_date: 2015-08-11 15:43:45
No, but there were very specific physical qualities that made it suited for that purpose, and those qualities existed independently of humans.
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:26:24
It would be, if you could time it correctly.  Good luck with that!
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:51:07


There's a thing called "time", and things happen after other things happen.  So no, Bitcoin will not be dead if it falls below 1000.  I promise.
@_date: 2015-08-27 03:23:29
Probably after.  Necessity is the mother of... Human action.  :P
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:12:41
You look at your income and buy a fixed amount each month, at the same time each month, that's my recommendation.  If you're currently sitting on a big pile of cash, I would recommend waiting to buy when you see people in this subreddit posting topics wondering if Bitcoin will ever recover.
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:56:07
I feel like this collective frustration Bitcoin isn't going away is going to bubble over into rage once the price shoots up again.
@_date: 2015-08-11 15:50:11
@_date: 2015-08-09 20:13:23
There's a transitional process where it overtakes other currencies.  Doesn't happen all at once.
@_date: 2015-08-08 16:03:28
Yep.  Digital money is worth more than gold in many cases because it has better properties for that purpose.
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:08:37
No no no no no.
Bitcoin is a STORE OF VALUE. Adding unnecessary transactions to the blockchain is expensive and unnecessary. If you really have the urge to use it as money, that can be done off the blockchain.  But it's totally unnecessary to Bitcoin's continued growth and success. Gold, for instance, already has a multi-trillion dollar market capitalization, and it is almost never used in transactions.
@_date: 2015-08-11 15:48:45

@_date: 2017-11-03 05:56:40
Keep in mind that the price of any good is set at the *margin*, so it's only the BTC that are being traded at a specific moment in time that determine what the price is for every other BTC in existence.
Yes, it can easily go back below 1000.  Even if 90% of people are strong holders.
@_date: 2015-08-20 00:33:38
When you buy coffee today, you use a digital entry in a database that represents an entry in another database that represents an entry in another database that represents an entry in another database that's backed by a promise that represents an entry in a database tracking the value of a basket of goods owned by the treasury and the central bank which are mostly entries in dozens of other databases (with the exception of the physical gold the Fed itself holds).
So not being able to buy small things with Bitcoin directly isn't exactly an unheard of quality for money to have!
@_date: 2015-08-13 19:15:25
How embarrassing.  Almost as embarrassing as those ridiculously tight jeans the "men" in New York city wear.
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:33:25
It's better than gold.  There are a few major flaws with Bitcoin, but until someone invents "god-money" we will have to make do with crappy substitutes like gold, bitcoin, and cash.  All of these have problems.
But they're all worth trillions of dollars.
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:00:47
Three fallacies here (I'm correcting these in a friendly tone):
1.  Saying a fall back to 1k is extremely unlikely is mostly an emotional reaction at this point.  Bitcoin was sub-1000 very recently, so it's not out of the question at all.
2.  "Kill cryptos for good" - As long as the network is functioning, Bitcoin will continue to gain users and grow in value.
3.  Mainstream - The mainstream are drooling idiots who enjoy superhero movies and cheap beer. They will not be interested in Bitcoin until they have no choice but to use it.  And by then, they won't be using *real* Bitcoin, they'll be using some PayPal Bitcoin-backed token.  So stop caring about what the Average Joe thinks of Bitcoin.  He doesn't matter.

@_date: 2017-11-05 04:44:05
Yep. Well it's not so much a matter of belief, it's just understanding the market and social dynamics that cause Bitcoin to go up in value over the long term.  Once you understand that stuff, you stop worrying and just wait with a smile on your face.
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:17:38
At that point, people will start using alternatives to Bitcoin.  We don't yet know the price point where that happens, though.  And I think it's much higher than most people here realize.  Miners will voluntarily (and eagerly) raise block size at that point.
@_date: 2015-07-03 00:56:07
And it won't be adoption by "users" or "consumers".  It'll be adoption by investment firms and wealthy individuals - as a store of value.

It's mining, not inflation.  We don't say gold has inflation.
The distinction is that inflation involves seignorage.  Mining doesn't.

No.  A good store of value is one that causes your purchasing power to rapidly increase.  A mediocre store of value is one that keeps your purchasing power flat.

Each time the price rises, a bunch of dummies buy some BTC and then sell 90% of it at some point in the next few weeks/months.

What's funny about this is:  even Keynesians have been predicting more inflation as a result of QE.  So Austrians aren't alone in the misassessment.  There will eventually be hyperinflation, however.  The Fed massively increased the base money supply, and that'll leak out into the greater economy.  Plus the U.S. will never substantially cut back on spending.

I don't think the analogy is exactly right, but it's close enough.  Bitcoin needn't be used by the masses (and probably won't be) initially.  It'll first be a speculative investment and an asset "geeks" and bankers hold.  They'll "get lucky" as the price continues to explode higher, and each cycle will see the masses laughing at the crashes and saying they "missed the boat" after the rises.

The key difference is there's little widespread incentive for people to use PGP.

I'm honestly not sure, I'm not well-versed in the technology behind Bitcoin at all.
But I would guess there could be a 2nd layer of encryption that could take place after the Bitcoin software is finished with its encrypting, and THAT could be the quantum encryption.  That's how I imagine it working, anyway.  In this way, the government wouldn't be able to identify which address belongs to which person.
Actually, that would be the strongest form of encryption imaginable - one where you don't even know your own wallet's address, and the computer does the transferring for you.  Or maybe a piece of software that literally makes it impossible for a government agent to take your bitcoins, even if you wanted them to.  This is starting to get a little far down the rabbit hole.  :P

I love writeups like these, because it makes you feel like this is truly the "silver bullet" that will ultimately kill the beast that is central banking, and free people from oppressive governments.  But we have to keep in mind this won't just happen automatically - it will require a lot of "getting the word out" on our part, and a lot of people offering their services/skills in exchange for bitcoin.
What makes me so excited is the simple fact that bitcoin has managed to survive as a valuable commodity even after so many scandals and frauds have been highly-publicized about it.  I will admit that I was very skeptical of bitcoin after its big run up and fall.  But now I see that it really does have a "root demand" that will always exist... bitcoin, besides just being cool, is actually really, really fucking useful.

This is why bitcoin is so cool - it's the final iteration of money as "communicator of value".  Money is no longer valuable in-and-of-itself (as 0's and 1's).  It's now just free speech.  And any attempt to interfere with bitcoin is just censorship.

@_date: 2012-12-28 05:39:32
Well there are several things at play which would make Bitcoin a good alternative for them.
First, it's true that Bitcoin's value is volatile, but that volatility will decrease over time as more and more people accept it in place of government-backed currency.  In other words:  last year it was a big deal if David or Sarah chose to stop accepting Bitcoin.  This year it's not a big deal because 18 other people in your area also accept it.  So you're not always "on the edge of your seat" with the value, and that means it's less likely the price will fall.  Adoption will increase and that'll lead the price to become less and less volatile.  And the remaining volatility will be in one direction:  up.
Second, the US government has a crapton of debt.  The last thing they want is for the value of the dollar to increase, because that makes their job of paying the interest on that debt even harder.  If suddenly 100+ million Japanese people were using dollars in their day-to-day lives, the dollar's value would skyrocket (relative where it is today), and ironically that would lead to the same scenario that caused the yen to collapse in the first place:  the collapse of the bond market due to unsustainable debt.
Bitcoin, not being backed by government debt, would make an ideal currency for the Japanese.  They'd even have an incentive to adopt it early:  its value would be rising and the early adopters would get more bang for their buck.  It isn't centrally controlled and the Japanese will be looking for something like that when the shit hits the fan.  They'll be pissed off at their central planners, who ruined their yen.  And then they'll hear about  a currency started by a man named Satoshi Nakamoto...


I don't think that's a stretch at all.  Bitcoin isn't like a speculative stock or bond.  It's a new tool, like email was a new tool a couple decades ago.  I personally see it going nowhere but up.
@_date: 2012-11-15 02:26:29
Anything is possible!  The problem is, any added demand in the bitcoin market will result in higher prices, which will result in bitcoin-holders gettign giddy and starry-eyed at the prospect of their coins appreciating in value.

There will be some more drama, for sure, but I don't think the price will be as volatile as it was near the start.

As interest in buying BTC rises, price rises.

Imagine governments trying to hire people to keep an eye on your computer usage at all times.  It just wouldn't fly, at all.  Even if a society was full of completely brainwashed pro-government socialist types, the incentive to avoid paying taxes and trade bitcoins "off the books" would be so high it would completely decimate the government's ability to generate revenue.

All things humans value, they value by "fiat" (if you're using that particular liberal definition of the word).
That's why people like myself prefer to not call Bitcoin "fiat" - there's no government telling us to value it.  You also can't categorize it as a "commodity money" because it's not a naturally occurring material.  So it's more appropriately called a "market money".

@_date: 2012-09-09 18:35:07
Oh yeah, I don't doubt the value of bitcoin will go up massively, as time marches forward.  I think it has value because people want it to have value - just like any other currency or good/service.  It's an extremely useful tool, and I suspect there's a serious shot it will supplant global fiat in the next 15 years.  I just think the services and people who are currently providing support for Bitcoin-related dealings aren't exactly very professional or ethical.  But that will change, as the currency spreads to other legitimate uses and more people adopt it.  We're still basically on the "ground floor" so to speak.
@_date: 2012-11-19 08:51:07

@_date: 2012-12-28 16:51:31
Right, and this is entirely possible to overcome quickly.  We just need to get the information out in Mexico that Bitcoins are valuable in USD, and people are willing to make the trade on a daily, even hourly basis.  Once people comprehend this, they would be incentivized to collect the BTC (with a small fee, guaranteed to be less than Western Union's), and then hand the BTC off to a larger agency that specializes in selling them back to Americans for USD.  Finance works on *volume*, so the more BTC/pesos/dollars being traded, the lower the margins will be and the better deal it'll be for each individual.

Agreed, I can't wait to see this become an app... maybe even incorporate it into the Bitcoin clients so it's constantly running in the background, automated.  That way everyone connected to the network is playing "BTC musical chairs" and it's impossible to track individual coins and addresses.
Coupled with a comprehensive blockchain pruning system, and this would end up being a truly next-gen client.

Awesome, I love reading stuff like this.  I think Bitcoin is the beginning of a major shift in how humans measure value across distance and groups, and it has a very strong chance of becoming a milestone in history along the lines of the creation of written language and penicillin.  If we could finally be done with monopolized government and mass-extortion (taxation), humanity could blossom and the quality of life in earth could explode.  I'm definitely not a believer in Utopia, but I think modern humans, if they were to be able to see the year 2250, would definitely view it as a utopia.

The best aspect of bitcoin IMO is that it can't be stolen by *governments*.  Gold in a vault can be confiscated.
@_date: 2012-09-04 22:44:55
But can't we see the transaction history?  In a case where someone hacks into an exchange and gets the coins, can't we see which wallets received them, and blacklist the wallets?

Yeah that was beautifully written.  Bitcoin (or a grandson of Bitcoin) will likely be the demise of governments as we know them.  Government will still exist, but it will be so weakened and modest that it'll be closer to a minarchist's dream than what we're accustomed to.

But everybody is greedy - it's call self-interest.  I'm not sure how this is an argument against any currency.
And hoarding isn't a big deal - it just means the price isn't high enough yet for those people to trade their BTC.  They've collectively decided BTC are worth more than the market is currently offering for them.
Nothing wrong with that.
@_date: 2012-11-19 01:07:25
Bitcoin is utterly unique.  And that's why I'm sure it will succeed.  Right now it's in its 1987 usenet/email stage, but in 12 years I think it'll be a word uttered in every household over the dinner table.  The above example is one of the many reasons I think it'll spread like wildfire.
@_date: 2012-08-30 21:55:21
I see, hmm.  Yes I can imagine that scenario unfolding, and while it might give Google a temporary "Cantillion effect" that moves value toward themselves, I don't think it would work over the long term.  Eventually the currency would become spread-out enough that the effect would subside and it would be just like every other digital currency.

@_date: 2012-09-10 04:59:25
Ehh... why not just start your own parallel fungible-contract-currency-thingy next to bitcoin?  What's the necessity in transforming existing bitcoins into colored ones?  Once they're colored, is it ever possible to return them to being "normal" bitcoins, for instance if the company goes bankrupt and the shares are worthless?  Couldn't this be artificially deflationary?

Yup.  Same with most new technologies - humans typically exploit new tech for the purpose of something related to sex.  We are naked apes!  :D

I think it would whack the price down initially, but over time the price would go back up to where it was previously.  It would also bring the "forbidden fruit" attraction to Bitcoin, making it an "oohhh ahhh" thing you can show your friends when you whip out your smartphone.
@_date: 2015-04-19 18:47:07

Great post, and great question.
The Bitcoin "value proposition" is quite abstract, which is why it has "only" grown to a $4 billion market in 6 years (as opposed to a $10 trillion market).  It takes a lot of education and understanding to be able to discern that Bitcoin is massively undervalued today.
If Bitcoin were something more straightforward, like the Oculus Rift, or Instagram, or the latest Apple phone, there wouldn't be a volatile and lengthy "price discovery" phase.  Consumers would immediately flock to the product and snap it up.
Ultimately the "average Joe" will want Bitcoin, though.  It'll take a while for him to realize it.  That's because hypermonetization starts with the elites (both intellectual and economic) and then makes its way down to the middle and left of the IQ bell curve.  Those people will continue to hoard dollars, euros, yen, yuan, etc... until doing so becomes prohibitively expensive and tedious (ie inflation and capital controls kick in).  Then they'll demand a money that's more "real".
But by the time that happens, Bitcoin will already be firmly entrenched among the intellectuals and techno-savvy.  And gold/silver can't be sent over the Internet in a trustworthy way.  So the table is being set.  But the roast is still in the oven, and the wine hasn't been poured.

It was indeed.  Until it wasn't any more.


No I mean when the British empire made slavery illegal in their domain.

I used to be a hardcore Ancap like yourself, and I still am a libertarian.  But over time I've come to adopt a more rounded view of history and progress.  Getting hot ears about government theft &amp; force is pretty pointless.  Focus instead on incentives and actually changing the balance of power.  Teaching people about anarcho-capitalism doesn't automatically make them sympathize with it.  The majority of people will always be statists, because that gives them the free goodies in the short term (as well as defense from other statists who have no incentive to care about their society).

Greenspan in particular was a big fan of objectivism and gold standard before he worked at the Fed.

I think most people here would agree.  It makes more sense to look at transactions (excluding popular addresses and long chains).  And that metric shows steady growth.
@_date: 2015-03-10 06:20:34
Agreed.  Miners will assuredly increase transactions per second when the market demonstrates heavy demand even at higher prices, but I don't think it's something we need to preempt.  It should happen naturally.

Because there's no reason to use the blockchain for this.  Any time you issue a token that has counterparty risk, it makes more sense to have your own internal network for the token (faster transfers, fewer security concerns, etc.)
Lots of people can't wrap their minds around counterparty risk, so they think the blockchain can be used to transfer title for other property/units of currency.  Which... it can.  But there's no point.

@_date: 2015-03-12 17:17:35
You're way overthinking this.  People won't accept Bitcoin as wages en mass until it's already saturated the savings sector.  And it doesn't matter anyway - anybody who wants Bitcoin will just buy it with their paycheck.
Also the halvings are already discounted by the market in the current price.
Bitcoin's use will continue to grow in the high finance arena long before you see widespread mainstream adoption.  Whales matter more than grandmas.

Yeah it sounds like a buy out strategy.
@_date: 2015-03-07 05:44:01
There's just one huge digital file called the "blockchain", which is continually adding transaction data.
If someone asks what a bitcoin looks like, you could just say it's like a frame in a movie file - the file itself is just digital data, and you can't watch it unless you have a computer or blu ray player.  The entire movie is like the blockchain, and the individual frames are transactions (inputs and outputs, which reference previous transactions).
So a private key references certain unspent outputs from previous transactions.  Bitcoin is like the ghost of gold.  There's nothing physical there, but it still gets the job done.
@_date: 2015-03-08 12:47:30


The blockchain isn't a body.

US dollars are fine for purchasing things that the government approves of, and paying taxes to the government.  The problem comes when you want to send or receive money from people in other parts of the world - you need to jump through hoops, pay fees, and convert the money.  You also have to hope your account is never frozen, or that the government doesn't devalue the currency by creating more.
People want your dollars because they need it to pay their taxes.  Legal tender laws require taxes to be paid in dollars, so this creates artificial demand for the fiat currency.

Well Bitcoin isn't a debt instrument, and it's pretty difficult to find anyone who'd be willing to accept a long term loan denominated in BTC because the value fluctuates so much.

I'll take this to mean, "You cannot store fiat currency digitally without a banking license."
Good job!
Now let's look at the implications of allowing everyone to store and transfer digital currency without a banking license.  It effectively makes banking services completely decentralized and global, bypassing all government regulations.  Do you know what happens in a market for banking services that has zero regulations?
"Complete chaos and mass theft?"
Nope!  Believe it or not, Hillary Clinton isn't necessary for a market to run smoothly.  Banks with good reputation rise to the top over time, and competition drives down prices while increasing standards for security.
Can you think of a banking service that might help the millions of people who don't want to pay big transaction fees to have access to the blockchain?

Two points:  you can't fairly determine what "similar" jobs are.  So you're making the assumption federal workers jobs are generally higher skilled, which I'm skeptical of.

Yes, because the market at-large doesn't care whether some BTC are "tainted" or not.  It's not possible for governments or individuals to proclaim that certain money is worth less because it was used to do X.  There will always be at least one market participant who will "take the BTC off your hands" for compensation that's very close to the original value of the BTC, and each jump between users, the BTC will again float up closer to its original value.

Nearly everybody will agree that Bitcoin's user base grows at a rate higher than 10% per annum, so the "inflation" isn't what's causing the price to decline.  The price simply got ahead of demand.  Whether that's the case currently is up for debate (I think the price should be at least double what it currently is).

Well by selling dollars in exchange for Bitcoin, you're actually *doing something* - you're taking value away from the dollar system and adding it to the Bitcoin system.
There are also altcoins that enable some degree of trustless mixing.  I doubt gold and silver coins will ever go away as being valuable.

Nope.  It's like saying "now that we've discovered apples, oranges will be worthless".  Totally different things.  Bitcoin itself is useful for its self-contained neutrality and utility.

If you're just looking to invest, I'd recommend putting no more than 10% of your total portfolio into Bitcoin.  I'd also recommend assuming this portion of your portfolio is a "sunk cost", in other words you shouldn't sell it before a given time (say 10 or 20 years) regardless of what the price of Bitcoin does in the meantime.  This outlook and strategy will reduce your stress a lot, and it should help you resist the temptation to trade.

Everybody worrying about blockchain size is thinking in terms of traditional files, like DVDs, Blu-Rays, FLACs, etc.  This is a fundamentally different file type, which is appropriate given the fact it's a fundamentally different process and processing chip.  The bulk of the cost is still in the ASICs, and it will probably always be the case.

People who get into investing typically hold a very "color by the numbers" view of it.

They also like the idea of heavy diversification (which doesn't usually include a substantial portion of gold/cash).

Well the top 0.1% store most of their wealth in real estate and stocks.  So the Fed exists to ensure those assets never fall in value (or if they do, it's a temporary and short-lived fall).  They do this by intervening on interest rates and by direct purchases of S&amp;P minis futures.  They have something called the "plunge protection team", you can Google it.
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:39:48


Currencies are also used to store wealth.  Bitcoin has the lowest transaction and storage costs of any currency ever created, and its supply at any given moment is known with certainty.


The value of everything is the nexus of demand and supply.


1.  You're assuming both the former currency and Bitcoin share the same properties - they do not.  
2.  You're not thinking through time.  Nobody here is claiming Bitcoin's value will grow all at once.  It happens gradually.

While it's true that it's possible to "shut down" the Bitcoin network, I disagree with you that it's a realistic consideration at this stage.  There's too much money to be made in the Bitcoin markets themselves to bother attacking the network.  Any government that attacks the network would themselves be attacked by other governments because of Bitcoin's global nature, and the fact it stores billions of dollars worth of value controlled by people all over the world.
Like I said, the Internet itself is a huge problem for many governments.  But they also understand it's necessary to remain politically and financially relevant.
As to full nodes - if that's ever an issue, miners and larger holders of BTC will help finance them to perpetuate the network.  This can be done via assurance contracts.

There will be Bitcoin payment processors that operate outside the jurisdictions of various nations, allowing competition in the field and forcing prices lower.  These payment processors will settle balances on the blockchain less-frequently than would otherwise occur.
So low transaction fees can basically be guaranteed as long as you're using a payment processor that's doing off-chain transactions.  People will obviously still be able to do on-chain transactions, but those will be more expensive.
Eventually computer storage and internet speed technology will catch up, enabling most transactions to occur on-chain.
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:51:20
Thanks, I'll check it out.
@_date: 2015-02-06 22:05:44


They'd make more money by buying up BTC than by attacking the network.  Remember that governments, TV, and newspaper industry all were inhibited by the Internet in some way.  But they didn't attack it directly, because that would require a massive "sunk cost" which they can't justify to taxpayers or shareholders.
And as I mentioned earlier, it's far easier (and cheaper) to attack the Internet infrastructure itself than to attack Bitcoin specifically.


Hm.  Well that's a problem then, isn't it?
@_date: 2015-02-28 16:50:27
Yeah, just saying "Bitcoin is hard to use" doesn't make it true.
@_date: 2015-02-23 17:41:10
Well it's not inflationary.  Inflation implies the issuer can generate new currency without incurring a cost - like the Fed generating dollars, for instance.  We don't call gold inflationary because even though you can dig more of it out of the ground, it costs a lot to do that.  So there's a natural check on the supply of gold, and Bitcoin.  That natural check doesn't exist with fiat.
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:50:53
Then I guess that would implicate the entire Federal Government, eh?
@_date: 2015-02-27 15:26:33
Buying assets using artificial money creates artificial demand for those assets, which artificially raises their price beyond what the market could bear.

Keep in mind the current price is taking all these auctions into account.  The bigger investors like Marc Andreessen, Tim Draper, etc. are waiting to buy in the auctions rather than messing with the open market.  I also think it's possible we're seeing manipulation of the price lower so they can get a better deal in the auctions.  Once the auctions are over, we should see the price start to rise again.
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:44:46

Well the price is formed by filling all the buy/sell orders that happen to match up symmetrically.  So some traders will say "Sell 100 BTC when the price hits $280" and that order is entered into the "book" (each exchange has their own books, and trading between the exchanges ensures the prices never deviate very far between them).
Sometimes there are surprise orders that suddenly send the price soaring or crashing because they trip a wire of automated trades.  This creates momentum, and it automatically fills other buy/sell orders.
This is the exact same price discovery mechanism that occurs in all traded assets (including stocks).

You're misunderstanding how Bitcoin works.  It uses public key cryptography, so if people didn't want to pay taxes, they wouldn't have to.  They could simply say, "No." and there's nothing the governments could do to make them.
Compare that to the system we currently have, where governments can endlessly expand the money supply and freeze/confiscate accounts at will.

First run antivirus to make sure your computer doesn't have any viruses.
Second, go to  and save the website to your desktop as an HTML file.
Third, disconnect from the Internet.  Cut off your wireless card.
Fourth, open the Bitaddress.org file on your desktop using your browser and it will automatically generate a Bitcoin keypair.
Fifth, print the keypair.
Sixth, close the browser.
Seventh, reconnect to the Internet.
^^That's how you make a secure cold storage paper wallet.  You can copy the address to the paper wallet by using a QR code reader and your computer's webcam.  Just send the Bitcoins you want to secure to the paper wallet's address.  Don't let the webcam see the private key, though.

Well you can't sell that many BTC at a set price.  Orders are filled in segments.  So people will say, "I'm willing to buy 200 BTC at $800 each", then "I'm willing to buy 300 BTC at $700 each" and so on.
So the market isn't like clicking a button and instantly getting cash for your Bitcoins.  It's a shallow pool.  The second you step into it, the water level changes.
So if the government sold all their Bitcoins at once, they could only expect to get the market-price for a few of them.  All the following Bitcoins would get much lower prices.  And they'd be snatched up by investors looking for a good bargain.
So the price would rise nearly immediately and the government would lose money if they tried to buy back the same number of BTC they had previously.
A lot of people don't understand **market mechanics** and it's important if you want to have an idea of how these things work.

Well I think Gavin has spoken about programming it to detect when a block is outrageously large and ignoring that.
Another interesting thought:  if we can have the protocol ignoring massive blocks, couldn't they also program it to ignore blocks that look like someone is gaming the system?  For instance, blocks without any transactions in them, or blocks that contain a lot of transactions of similar size or a lot of transactions going into a single address.  Basically teach the protocol to recognize BS when it sees it.

I would actually argue that a $1T market cap is conservative.  There's no reason to think that if Bitcoin is successful in providing value-added to that segment of the global economy, it couldn't also provide value-added to other segments of the global economy (those that add up to tens of trillions).
In other words, assuming Bitcoin maintains its valuable properties to $1T, there's no reason it shouldn't also hit $2T.  The only limitation is where it stops providing **marginal utility**.  And there are a TON of cracks in the global economy that Bitcoin can fill.

Stability would be achieved when it's possible for the average user of a cryptocurrency to be capable of ignoring all other currencies completely:  In other words, he can buy nearly everything he wants and needs with the new cryptocurrency.  He would only have to use dollars on rare occasion.
That would make a "Bitcoin lifestyle" possible and unless governments gave more people a reason to switch to Bitcoin (like rapid inflation), the nerdy group of people who prefer to use it would continue to enjoy relatively stable prices.  Adoption would become saturated among techies because economic pressures wouldn't necessitate adoption by the masses.
But this assumes government currencies somehow retain stable value even as the underlying economy worsens.

Well what I described would be an overwhelming 51% attack.  Actually it would be more accurate to call it a 300% attack, because to know with near-certainty that you were going to get every single block in a row would require more than tripling the total network hash rate.  It would require over 2 billion dollars worth of computer hardware and tons of electricity.
Basically what would happen is the government's processors would start to discover the blocks sooner than the honest nodes' processors, because they're faster and there are more of them.  The government would want to stop all Bitcoin transactions, so they'd just ignore the pending transactions and mine the blocks empty.
Because of the overwhelming processing power, the blocks would be discovered one after another, in quick succession.  The honest nodes couldn't keep up.
It should be noted that the odds of this happening are extremely low, because it would be much easier (and cheaper) for governments to simply ban Bitcoin and arrest anyone using it.  Either way, it would be an absolute PR nightmare for the government.  Newspaper headlines would be written about it:  "NSA shuts down Bitcoin network, billions of dollars up in smoke"
And worse (for government), is that restarting the blockchain on honest nodes would be relatively easy to do.  People would just use a different mining method that the government's processors aren't designed to excel at.  So it would be a cat-and-mouse game like it is with Hollywood and BitTorrent.  Each time, the cost of attack would go up and people would get angrier.

Good luck, sir.  I happen to think it's a good investment, but please keep these things in mind:
1.  Gold is a very safe alternative to Bitcoin, so you should consider diversifying into that, at least a bit.
2.  Governments can still seriously fuck up Bitcoin at this early stage.  In fact they probably will try.  Ultimately I don't think they can stop Bitcoin's spread and adoption, but they will try, and they will probably succeed (at least initially) at whacking the price down by making it illegal for businesses to accept them.
If I had to guess, I would say your decision will work out well for you in the medium term.  Meaning sub-$150 Bitcoin.  But after that, government attention will spook the market.  So be psychologically prepared.
@_date: 2013-01-14 05:14:08
Right, and the other thing to keep in mind is that Bitcoin's inflation is known in-advance, meaning the market has already discounted it.  The market can't discount the Federal Reserve's announcements because it doesn't know these things ahead of time.  So Bitcoin's inflation is already "built in" to the price.

At this point it's clear the rewards of owning Bitcoin are greater than the risks.  But **as always, calculate your personal risk tolerance by the % of your savings you are storing in Bitcoin**.
If you are sitting on $200,000 savings, it's probably not advisable to put more than 20k (10%) in Bitcoin.  As time passes and Bitcoin gets more-and-more reputable and governments agree to keep regulations to reasonable levels, then you should start to increase your % holdings.

In a world where Bitcoin is commonly used, it's MUCH easier for the public to stage a unified tax protest.  The government can't just make a few phone calls and get your money, or send a thug to your door to get your money.  They have to beg you to send it to them.

This is where we disagree, I guess.  I just view the blockchain as unwieldy.  I'm not an expert in computer science, and I'm fully aware that proposing an idea is much easier than executing it.  But I do think what I've described is better than the current Bitcoin protocol, because it allows for more privacy and (theoretically) a much smaller client installation.  I own a lot of BTC, so I'd love to see Bitcoin succeed beyond our wildest dreams.  So anything that would simplify it and make it more compact/elegant excites me.

Get used to it.  I had $1000 I was going to sink into Bitcoin back when it was in the 60's and I couldn't make my purchase because the exchange I was using (Coinbase) was backlogged with orders.
The price will climb and then crash, and then climb some more.  2 steps forward, 1 step back.  Any entry prior to BTC being $500 is an "early adopter" entry, as far as I'm concerned.

Of course, if you're looking for a means to determine relative value the established currencies will work better than Bitcoin.

Ultimately people will choose to save the thing that's gaining value, and spend the thing that's losing value.

I think the "blacklist" proposal you cite would be more effective.
Ultimately I think the current singular blockchain structure will be superseded by a better implementation.  There may be a way to further decentralize the mining process that we haven't yet considered.  After all, thinking "outside of the box" is what Satoshi Nakamoto did in creating Bitcoin.  I think it's probable that a brilliant new method for verification and decentralization is right under our noses.  Someone will stumble on it.

There are actually two types of deflation, and the writer conflates them.  The first is deflation due to a contraction of credit (debt) and this is what happens to fiat currencies.  The second is called "secular deflation" and this is what happens with non-debt-based money like Bitcoin and gold.
The second type is no big deal because of something called "time preference".  Most people would rather be very rich today than obscenely rich in 10 years.  So they will spend their money even though they know they can get better stuff in the future.
A good example of this is when people buy a smartphone, knowing better technology will be out in 2 years.

Maybe you should start getting used to the idea that Anarcho-Capitalism is becoming more mainstream.  When people research the origin of Bitcoin, and its earliest adopters (those who have the most wealth stored in BTC), they will find that those people are Anarcho-Capitalists.
Sorry you don't like that.  Sorry you're afraid it'll "turn people off" and "give a bad first-impression".  But over time, peoples' views about things change.  At first the world was very skeptical about Bitcoin.  And as time goes on, more and more people are dropping that skepticism.  The same will happen with Anarcho-Capitalism.

At any given moment, there are a certain number of Bitcoins that are "up for sale".  This number is extremely small relative to the total supply of Bitcoins.  You can think of it like your neighborhood:  there may be hundreds of houses, but at any given moment only a few of those houses are actually for sale.
The price buyers and sellers agree on is considered the "market price".  So the trade of a very small sliver of the total bitcoin supply affects the price for all other bitcoins.  This is called "marginal utility".  Price is formed at the margin.

The price of Bitcoin is propped up by people refusing to sell it for fiat at ever-higher offers.
But your spending and selling isn't enough to seriously affect the market overall.  The market is much larger than you, so your selling will be like peeing in the ocean.


It will cause the price of Bitcoin to go up because Bitcoin's **utility will increase**.  Right now owning Bitcoin is like owning a hammer and only having 10 nails.  If Amazon accepts Bitcoin, suddenly you'll have thousands of nails so your hammer becomes that much more useful.  And people will start buying more hammers (Bitcoins).
Bitcoin's utility encompasses many things, one of which is the ability to save money without fearing inflation.  That's why its value continually goes up over the long term, even when large merchants don't accept it yet.
EDIT:  "closed loop economy" doesn't really matter.  The value of Bitcoin will continue to climb regardless, because more and more people will demand it.

You can't just "shut it all off".  You can only hijack the blockchain from a certain block forward.
So what happens in this scenario, is that the Bitcoin community notices the mining process was compromised.  So they agree to resume the blockchain where it left off, just before it was taken over by the attacker.  The unlucky individuals who performed transactions during the 51% attack will have those transactions reversed.  But the other 99.9% of Bitcoin users will be happy to return to the previous block, because their wallet balances won't be affected.
The blockchain will resume where it left off using a new algorithm, one that the attacker's hardware is worthless against.  This would cause the attacker to basically waste millions (billions?) of dollars trying to attack Bitcoin, only to have Bitcoin reappear within a few hours in a new form.  It's like a very expensive game of "whack a mole".

The best way for a billionaire to "support" Bitcoin would be to do the following:
1.  Invest in ASIC mining chips and sell them for relatively cheap, to get them into lots of different hands.  Don't allow government agencies/banks to buy them.
2.  Open a webstore like Amazon.com that lists every item at a 5-10% discount (when you convert the Bitcoin price into USD).  Initially there will be losses, but its mere existence would drive up the value of Bitcoin as people flooded into it to buy products.
3.  Create BitcoinATMs with a great user interface, that allow for conversion TO and FROM cash, and place these in gas stations/malls in all major cities.
Basically the goal should be to get BTC into as many hands as possible.  The more people who own BTC, the higher its value will go (because people who have possession of something want to believe its worth something, and will behave like it is).

The "store of value" aspect of Bitcoin is more valuable than the "can instantly transfer money to anyone" aspect of Bitcoin, IMO.
I think we'll see transaction fees rise and Bitcoin become more value-dense, but I don't think you'll see people buying hamburgers with Satoshis because at that point they'll be using other currencies backed by Bitcoin (ie payment processors keeping most payments for small items off the blockchain).

There is no distinction.  I could be the most-generous person in the world, but if I stole the money before giving it away that would nullify my generosity.


It is if you also force people to use that money to pay their taxes with.  Look up "legal tender laws".  It's what gives fiat currencies their value.

Mining isn't profitable.  You'll spend more on electricity than you will earn in BTC.  So you're better-off just buying the Bitcoins on an exchange like Coinbase or BitStamp.  You could also buy them in-person using localbitcoins.com

Oh I totally agree.  The transition would be very simple:  the government should just stop forcing people to pay it.  If people want to use government services, they can pay for them if they choose to.  Eliminate force.


This is like saying, "Every cent the robber stole, he spent back into the economy.  Therefore, the robber wasn't behaving unethically and didn't hurt the economy at all."

Not unless they can prove you own the Bitcoins in question.  And your name isn't attached to the address.
Also, if someone chooses not to pay the government their BTC, the government is screwed.  There's no way they can confiscate them or freeze the account or garnish their wages.
Third, if the person in question leaves the country, the government is doubly-screwed.  Bitcoin, being a global currency, is useful anywhere in the world.  So unlike a geographically-bound currency, people who own it can be anywhere and enjoy their wealth.

Your problem is that you're making an "across the board" judgment about an economy, just like a central planner would.

Norway is above the US in all three lists.  I also emphasized the fact that most of the US's income is isolated to a few geographic areas within the country.  There are, of course, many variables when calculating quality of life and disposable income.  But the median US income has been falling since 2008, and especially since the advent QE.


Actually it bumps it up to $20,196 per capita, which is slightly higher than OECD average:


External debt isn't an inclusive or useful metric.  Debt:GDP ratio is a better indicator of a nation's ability to pay the interest on its liabilities, and the US is 9th from the bottom (Greece), while Norway is at the top of that list.


This metric doesn't include transfers and bailouts, which account for a very large portion of the malinvestments caused by the US government.


I agree, high government spending, redistribution, and taxation are bad for an economy.


Norwegian citizens are richer, if you count their sovereign wealth fund.  Also, the metric you cite ignores many variables that make life very expensive for the average US citizen - taxes, inflation, regulations, health care expenditures, higher education expenditures, etc.  It also ignores the massive public debt per household in the US, which currently stands at around $140,000.


These metrics don't include key variables that explain why, for instance, 47 million Americans are on food stamps, or why youth unemployment is so high.  They also don't explain why countries with strong social programs (such as Spain, Portugal, Denmark, the UK, Italy, and Greece) are also suffering from similarly deep recessions.


The record shows that wealth inequality in the US began increasing after the implementation of the largest welfare programs in that country's history - LBJ's "Great Society".
The bulk of US government largesse recently has gone to the banks, military, and government employees.  Not the public at large.

Bitcoin does have value outside of a medium of exchange.  It is a decentralized ledger with very high security, which means it can be used to prove things - titles, deeds, contracts, etc. - without the need of a trusted third party.
Second, it isn't necessary for money itself to have a value aside from being money - in fact, this quality is undesirable for a stable money, because commodity-based money affects productive markets, and is affected by production of the commodity itself.
Third, the definition of "fiat money" is money that is backed by legal tender laws.  Bitcoin isn't fiat.

Yeah a paper wallet can't be hacked if you generate it and print it while your computer is offline.  There are some guides on how to do this, just search around.  Scan your computer to make sure it has no viruses, then disconnect from the Internet.  Open the  HTML file you saved on your desktop.  Generate the paper wallet/s.  Print them.  Close browser.

I think most economists nowadays despise anything that's not straight out of an economics textbook (written by a Keynesian, of course).
Bitcoin confounds them.  They can't explain its popularity and rising success.  They could never have predicted it.  So I think it really scares them, because they know if it continues to be successful (and if it grows), it'll invalidate a lot of their claims and make the textbooks look hilariously out of date.

The more I've thought this through, the more optimistic I am.  They can't stigmatize the entire currency, and they know it.  So they're resorting to stigmatizing a portion of it.

Download the "Mycelium Wallet" from the Google play store.  Install it.  Transfer your Bitcoin to the address it provides you with.
You can use a QR reader to read the address off your phone's screen using your computer's webcam.  A good one is called "QuickMark".  That way you don't have to manually type in the whole address on your laptop.

How long?  Bitcoin has been around 4 years.  It should be getting halfway-mainstream within the next 4 years.  That's the point where the price per Bitcoin is above 200 dollars and you start to hear people talking about it on TV sitcoms.  Assuming the Dollar/Yen/Euro are still intact at this point, the pressure for Bitcoin adoption will still be tremendous - economic stagnation and unemployment will lead the Greeks and others to seek alternatives.
I think Bitcoin could reach the same level of adoption as gold fairly quickly, because it's easier to own and transfer and weigh/measure than gold is.
In 10-15 years, Bitcoin could be the de-facto international currency and governments could reach a point where they stop trying to reign it in because it's too late.

It appears they know they can't outright ban it, otherwise that draws too much attention to it as a solution.  So they need to impede it and draw lots of question marks around it (so people are afraid to accept it or save in it).

It requires entrepreneurs to sell BTC for a small profit to the citizens of Venezuela.  Just like selling any other product.
The problem is that selling a currency is tough.  Most people will agree to buy a pair of shoes or a TV.  But a currency is so abstract in comparison.  And people will naturally default to the "it's a ponzi scheme" thing.  So Bitcoin is still in an early stage, where people are becoming more educated about it and adoption is spreading among the intellectuals.  Once the masses see that the intellectuals are adopting it, they'll hop on board.

A hardware wallet is a little physical device that is a one-way thing, so when you connect it to a computer, it's impossible for the computer to infect it with a virus or for your computer to read the private keys stored on it.  This allows noobs to keep their Bitcoins in a physical device and any time they want to send money, they can just attach it to the computer and it will "sign" the transaction without exposing the private key to the computer.  It's much easier and safer, no need to worry about hackers.
Dark Wallet is a new implementation of the Bitcoin client software.  So it will work in your browser and allow you to safely mix coins and automatically hide your IP to keep your transactions private.  Very user-friendly interface.

I like your posts generally, but you're not doing the math right on this.

Oh I agree with you, and if what you're saying is true, it would act as an automated system of arbitrage between the various currencies.  You could even have online banks that automatically diversify their depositors' accounts across a spectrum of many cryptocurrencies.  It would protect individuals from any volatility in the currency markets, while (I think) stabilizing the exchange rates.
EDIT:  Essentially what I'm saying is that these alternative currencies will end up tracking Bitcoin, and each other.  They likely won't dance up and down much like the FOREX markets.

If there is a market for Bitcoins in Africa (which we can assume there is, regardless of how thin it might be), someone will find it worth their while to do this, yes.

Would it be possible to create a new blockchain with a bot that doles out an equivalent amount of coins to the number of Bitcoins people "pay" it?
For instance, someone could set up a fake Bitcoin address that nobody has the key for, and anytime coins are sent to it they are (for all intents and purposes) "destroyed".  The bot could then reimburse the contributors to this address with an equivalent-amount of new coins on the new blockchain.
This would eliminate the need to keep up with a long blockchain of past transactions, and if it was entirely open-source, people could look at the code and verify that it's a safe way to solve the lengthy blockchain problem.  The newly dished-out coins would have a 1:1 exchange rate with the original BTC.

"Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world, but to get a Bitcoin address requires a huge download - many gigabytes.  And your IP address can be linked to the Bitcoin address, so governments can find you."

SO many people make this mistake.  I guess they teach the wrong definition of "fiat" in public schools.
Fiat money is backed by legal tender laws.  That means a government forces people to pay taxes with it and forces them to accept it for settlement in debts.
Bitcoin isn't fiat.


Sure, you could open up a bank that accept Bitcoins for deposit and then loans them out.  But people would ignore it and laugh at you.
People simply don't need banks with Bitcoin.  The technology obviates banks.  And if you tell people, "I have 400BTC on my books, but I've lent them out to people!" they'll roll their eyes and say "You don't have any money.  You just have promises."
It isn't possible to expand the supply of credit with Bitcoin, because the debts wouldn't be insured by the FDIC.  Anyone who tried to do this would go bankrupt within a year.

What you're saying would be true if the Federal Reserve were dealing in a non-fiat currency.
Fiat currency (in this case, the dollar) is artificially valuable because it has the government to enforce the debt settlements and taxation.  You're forced to accept dollars for debt settlement, and you're forced to pay dollars to the government when you pay taxes (otherwise you'll go to jail).
Second, in the case you're talking about, the Fed is manipulating bond markets, which are debt.  The USD is backed by debt promises.  Bitcoin isn't debt.  It has value in-and-of-itself, outside of any contracts or promises.
So contracting the supply of a currency like Bitcoin would **not** cause its value to increase.  It would only cause people to seek out another currency that isn't manipulated artificially.

It's not predictable because aggregates aren't as easy to analyze in a decentralized economy as they are in a centralized one.  Humans don't act in aggregate when they don't have a central authority prodding them to.

@_date: 2013-10-26 02:03:36
Okay I'm glad you're asking me because I've seen other people mislead newbies about this.
Step One:  Go to  and download the whole website to your computer's hard drive (and maybe make a backup to a thumb drive, too).  Your computer will save it as an HTML file.  You'll be able to do this by clicking around in your browser's menus and looking for the phrase "save page as".
Step two:  Disconnect completely from the Internet.  If you're on a laptop, cut off the wireless chip.  Then go get a pen and piece of paper to write on.  Get a copy of a book you like.  On the paper, write down 6 random English words from the book.  Don't write down "to" or "the" or anything like that.  Make the words completely unrelated.  Make the words relatively uncommon, but real.  The example everyone uses is "correct, horse, battery, stapler".
Step three:  While still disconnected from the Internet, open the HTML file you saved using a browser.  This will bring up  in offline mode.  Click on the "Brain Wallet" tab.  Then click on the "show?" box so you can see what you're typing in the text area.  Type in those words, exactly as you wrote them down on the paper, with only a space between each one.  **Punctuation and capitalization count.**
Step four:  Click the "view" button.  You now have your brain wallet keypair.  You can print this page (while still offline!!).  You also have the words necessary to recreate this wallet in the event of a disaster (like a house fire or a theft of your computer).  **close the browser before reconnecting to the internet**.
Step 5:  send your Bitcoins to the public address given on the brain wallet you just printed.  Keep the private key hidden from computer webcams.  Hide the paper somewhere you know you can find it if you ever forget the 6 words.  Jot the words down in several places so you'll never lose track of them.
To spend the Bitcoins in the future, you can import the private key into a Bitcoin client.  That also exposes the wallet to potential hacking, so only do this when you're prepared to take the risk.  But as long as you've done what I described, this paper wallet will always be safe from hackers.

The challenge is having parallelism while also having zero-trust.  You have to be able to prevent all efforts to double spend.  And that's very tricky and difficult.
I'm sure it's possible, and some clever computer scientists will figure out how to do it in the future.  But it's not nearly as straightforward as most people think it is - this is a unique and challenging problem.  As Bitcoin grows in use and popularity, we'll see TONS of computer scientists suddenly turning their attention to these scalability issues.  And that's when we'll see some awesome solutions proposed and implemented.

Then maybe they should put an equivalent amount of effort into getting Bitcoins.
If they want to partake in the future profits from having been among the first to own a decentralized global digital currency, they should sure as hell expect to bend over backwards to get it.
But they don't have to bend over backwards.  They just need to figure out a way to send fiat money to people who have BTC and are willing to trade.  It's not that tough.  Stop making it out to be some magnificent achievement.

The economy was growing faster before the income tax began in 1913.  Poverty was falling faster before the welfare system was expanded in the 1960's.
So as much as you like to claim government is helping society's prosperity, the fact show a different story:  government actually impoverishes society by wasting scarce resources.


Oversight happens when consumers choose to purchase one product rather than another product.  Businesses are held accountable by consumer choice.
Governments are territorial monopolists of force.  So their consumers have no choice, and therefore they have no oversight.

Well we can never know the future with absolute certainty, but we can make educated guesses using the information that we know to be true today.
Bitcoin is fundamentally different from stocks, bonds, and other currencies.  It's the "first of its kind".  So being the first of its kind, it will naturally go up in value much faster than other investment vehicles.
Bitcoin is also extremely useful.  In fact, it becomes more useful as more people use it.  It becomes more useful as the price rises.  You can't really say the same for other investment vehicles.
Really the only things inhibiting Bitcoin becoming worth $10 trillion or more is governments.  So we'll have to see how governments react to it.  I suspect that even if governments attack Bitcoin with full-force, they will end up losing.  And to explain why I think this would require a long overview of the technology behind Bitcoin and the economic incentives of the individuals participating in the Bitcoin economy.
Bitcoin is an idea, and it's impossible to kill ideas.  You can slow them down a bit, but with millions of copies of the blockchain on hard drives around the world, you can never eradicate it.

Things are only taxable if the government can see them, or knows who owns them.
You're using the legal definition of the word "taxable", which is a sort of silly, redundant term.  When you use that definition, anything the government says is taxable, is taxable.  But we all know that's not the case in the real world:  black and gray markets aren't taxed by governments, because governments simply can't tax them.  Therefore, they aren't taxable.

Bitcoin is basically a value black-hole that will destroy fiat currencies.  But in order to grow, the technology behind it must improve from where it stands today.  The protocol must go from only supporting 7 transactions per second (as it does now) to supporting around 3 million transactions per second.
Is that do-able over the next 20 years?  I think so, yes.
The market cap of Bitcoin will ultimately be the equivalent of the global M2 money supply, or nearly that.  So assuming the growth isn't inhibited by government attacks on the protocol or technical limitations, $1,000,000 per BTC is a reasonable 30 year target.

It's not a huge deal.  Even if they succeeded at a 51% attack, the blockchain could be restarted at the last legitimate block (prior to the attack).  Bitcoin has "save points", just like a videogame.  And when the blockchain resumes, it could function using a different hashing algorithm.

Right, well I think a big chunk of modern humanity's problems stem from government controlled inflationary money.
When you have persistent inflation, the only way to avoid it is to buy risky investments - stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.  These things act like the little toy boats that float on top of the inflation.  This causes bubbles and busts.
Inflation also encourages consumption.  Why save when your money will be worth less next year?  Buy buy buy!  Then you have this culture of consumption where everything is cheap and breaks after 1 year.  Buy a replacement!
So bitcoin (or whatever replaces it) will be a huge boon to humanity.  It will provide us with all the advantages of gold, and all the advantages of digital currency.

Well I think at this stage they could certainly destroy the network, but it would only serve to validate the Bitcoin thesis.  At that point there would be a major incentive by the enemies of the US government to create a more-powerful "Bitcoin 2.0".  You'd see more enthusiasm than ever for the project.
And as I said before, they can ramble all they want about drugs and gambling.  But at the end of the day, Bitcoin is just numbers.  Nobody is forcing anyone to use it.  Nobody is forcing anyone to exchange those numbers for "real" (heh) money.
And that's the ultimate beauty of the system, in my opinion.  It strikes at the very core of theory about what money is.  It will force people to admit that governments are censoring the neutral communication of value.

I think when you say the word "taxable", you mean:  the government has decided it has a right to steal a portion of it.
When libertarians/anarchists hear the word, they think of it in terms of other words that end in "-able".  That is to say, Bitcoins are only taxable as long as the government can track down who owns them and show that the address belongs to the person.

Google "Giffen Good".  I believe Bitcoin fits the bill nicely for that.
A Giffen Good is a good that increases in value *because* its value is increasing.  Eventually there will be a breaking point where people look around and see that they still can't buy much day-to-day stuff with Bitcoin, and the price will have a correction.  But as a means to save value, Bitcoin beats most others bar-none because you can take it outside of the country just by memorizing a sentence/passphrase.
I expect Bitcoins "velocity of money" would increase as its price falls, and decrease as its price rises.  So I'm confident Bitcoin's long-term trend is up, but we will go through many of these "bubble/burst" phases on the way up.  It's just the market's natural way of increasing use of a **useful** tool.

And nothing I said was ad hominem.  I was simply pointing out that you're anti-Bitcoin.  It's okay.  Embrace it.  You don't like the idea that people finally have access to a money that governments can't control.  You know the danger this poses to your political ideology.

I don't think it hurts to have a lot of physical cash.  Interest rates are so low in banks now, there's really no point in even having much in there.  I also have a good chunk of my savings as physical silver, gold, and Bitcoin.  Silver and gold hold their value even through deflation, and Bitcoin is a riskier (but potentially very rewarding) investment.

This actually sounds fascinating and like it could be a good idea.  To the layperson, it would seem idiotic.  But the truth is that proof of work's only purpose is to decentralize the network as much as possible.
If there were a way to make a proof of work that only a human could solve, but computers could verify, we could make the network astoundingly decentralized and impossible to perform a 51% attack on.  Discovering and implementing such a mechanism would be quite a challenge though!

Actually the more accurate value is using the M2 money supply, which includes the money people have deposited in banks.  He used the base money supply, M1, which is not accurate because it doesn't include the total capital people have available to buy stuff.  Using M2 yields a price of about 514,000 dollars per Bitcoin.  Keep in mind this is only the US, and Bitcoin is a global currency.

There's an FAQ on the right.
The easiest (and best) way to get Bitcoins is to buy them.  Mining isn't profitable now, because there's too much competition over too few coins.
You can buy them from a number of exchanges.  You can also trade them for cash, if you can find someone near you on localbitcoins.com

I think right now the cap is 1 megabyte, but don't quote me on that.  It might be lower than that.
If we start hitting the cap for blocks regularly, it's highly-likely the miners will decide to increase the block size to include more transactions.  Reason being:  miners want to net the most fees they can.  So they'll continue to increase the block size until they reach a nice equilibrium where the fees are high-enough to maximize their income while being low-enough to not scare off most Bitcoiners.
This is really the genius of the Bitcoin protocol, in my opinion.  Because every aspect of the mining process is a variable subject to change, and the change is brought about by economic incentives rather than a programmer's ideal scenario.

You're in complete denial.  You're telling us things that fly in the face of what we're seeing day-to-day.
In the real world, economists laugh at Bitcoin.  They shoo it away.  They jump to preconceived notions about how "it's deflationary, so it can't work".
Paul Krugman called it "the anti-social network".
The number of academic papers written about Bitcoin are few.
Basically you're trying to salvage the reputation of your pet ideology.  Even you can't admit that Bitcoin is money.  You have to call it a "speculative commodity" - like these artificial distinctions in terminology make any difference whatsoever in how people interact and use tools.

We often hear the term "viral" used to describe things on the Internet.  And it's true, ideas are often viral.  We have a term for the most-viral ideas:  memes.
For a very long time, governments and elites have controlled (indirectly) the memes in most societies.  But the Internet is slowly dismantling this tendency, because it allows all ideas/concepts to spread without the need for expensive publishing/printing/broadcasting costs.
Bitcoin is an extreme form of the viral meme, because it takes it a step beyond just concepts, and enters the realm of *incentives*.  It doesn't matter if you are a statist, or a socialist, or a communist, or a fascist - you are always self interested.  Money is the fulcrum of control for this reason.  Those elites who control the money can direct and recruit individuals to do their bidding.
Assuming the network continues to function as it has for the past 5 years, we should expect to see some amazing social changes going forward.  Humans are naturally libertarian.  It's the money that has made them so subservient to the elites.

The price of things is set by supply and demand.
There are a limited supply of bitcoins that are available for purchase at any given moment.  These are the "marginal bitcoins".  They set the price for all the others.
Same is true for all other things in a free market.  So if a house in your neighborhood (one that's similar to your house) sells for $290,000 then that causes your house's value to gravitate toward $290,000 - even though your house isn't technically "up for sale" at the moment.
So marginal items (the items that are currently for sale) set the price for all other similar items.
A rising price indicates that demand outpaces supply, and people are willing to pay more in order to have access to something.
Bitcoins are in demand because of their unique properties.  They are the best money humans have ever devised.  In order to understand why, you should think about what properties a good money has (in theory) and compare those "ideal money qualities" with the money that currently exists in the world today.  Bitcoin surpasses most (or all) other money in the world today in having these properties.  So it will ultimately win in the free market competition among the various types of money.  It'll just take some time for the market-at-large to recognize this and account for it.
Every so often the price gets ahead of itself (there's no way to know whether it has done that now - it's not possible to predict the future).  When that happens, the price "corrects" (ie falls).
You can think of price as being like a drunk man stumbling through a pitch-black, cluttered room.  He's basically got to feel his way around, guessing where things are.  It's a "trial and error" thing.  That's where the bubbles and busts come from.  It's just the market attempting to figure out the true value of something.

I'm still a bit confused about what's happening here.
Why is this a major advantage over just handing out your plain old Bitcoin address?  I thought you could already generate an offline wallet and give out the address.
Is it because there's a new address created for each individual customer, which increases privacy?  But wouldn't that just be a hassle for the receiver of the bitcoins?

1.  It wouldn't affect your ability to transfer Bitcoin.  It would just affect which stores could accept Bitcoin from you.  If the government decided your address was blacklisted, they could ban stores from accepting BTC from your address.
2.  The local shops would be required to do a background check on every single address that sends them money.
Internationally these lists wouldn't have much of an effect, though.  You could always leave the country with your Bitcoins and spend them elsewhere.  Or trade them with individuals on the street for cash.

It's open source software.  But there are a set of "core developers" who make changes to the most-commonly-used Bitcoin programs, and those changes are implemented by the miners if they see fit.
So in the unlikely event the core developers decided to turn evil and make some bad changes to the Bitcoin code, the miners would just ignore their suggested updates and continue to use the old software.
There's a financial incentive for everyone involved to play nice and make Bitcoin the best it can be, though.  Remember that both the core devs and the miners hold thousands of Bitcoins.  So they want to see the price continue to rise.

Because the total network hash-rate as it currently stands is much higher than is necessary for profitability.  Mining is basically a lottery.  More processing power buys you more lottery tickets.  But the total size of the lottery jackpot doesn't go up.  So over time, people have bought millions of tickets (ie added more hashing power to the network) in hopes to get a cut of that tiny jackpot.
At this point, mining is more akin to seeding torrents.  It's a nice thing to do for the network's overall security (like charity), but it doesn't actually get you anything.  You spend more on chips and electricity than you win in BTC.

I think you're confused about why gold is doled out as paper contracts and digital tokens.  It's for convenience.  Most people don't want to buy an expensive vault to.store their gold.  Most people can't find a business that will accept their gold as payment, because making change with gold is tough.  Gold isn't portable or easily divisible.  It's easy to steal.

No, it's not.
You can issue centralized tokens that are "backed" by Bitcoin, but you can never back a decentralized token with another asset.  And any time you peg the value of two things together artificially, there is always a great risk that peg will be broken - either by traders or by governments (or simply breaking your promise).

He could try to get that many Bitcoins, but the demand for bitcoins would skyrocket as the ratio of buy-orders exceeds sell-orders by a factor of 10000.  So as the big exchanges like MtGox try their best to fill his order, the price will explode before they have enough BTC on-hand to fill it.
Solution?  The King of Saud would have to buy in small increments, over a long period of time.  But even this would send the price WAY higher.  At that point, Bitcoin would become a "Giffen Good", a good that's increases in value **because** it is increasing in value.

This is the same conclusion that IMF economist came to when he wrote the piece about the danger of Bitcoin to international finance:  
Bitcoin has the potential to be a "black hole" of sorts, sucking up value from the fiat currencies.  But in order for this to happen, a few technical things need to be in place:
1.  Bitcoin becomes easier to use.  This means a proliferation of Trezor-like wallets and user-friendly apps for smartphones.
2.  Confirmation times are short, and miners' fees stay relatively low.
3.  Liquid, decentralized cash exchanges for BTC - at least a couple hundred people in each city that are willing and able to exchange BTC for currency and vice versa.  Kind of like marijuana dealers.  Reliance on MtGox and Coinbase should be reduced because the US government will surely shut them down eventually, as Bitcoin poses a threat to their captial controls.
4.  A rising Bitcoin price.  Don't be fooled by the people who say Bitcoin needs a "stable" price in order to become widely adopted.  They're wrong.  Bitcoin's adoption will accelerate as people catch on to the fact it is in limited supply, and therefore useful as a value storage medium.  First adopters will become wealthy.  This isn't a bug, it's a feature.

I disagree.  I think if there were a catastrophic failure of the protocol, the odds of the blockchain being completely abandoned are slim to none.  Reason being:  the vast majority of people who hold BTC as savings will be perfectly fine with "dialing back" the blockchain to the block right before the fatal error was discovered.  After all, they weren't making transactions at that point in time.  Their wallet balances were settled.
So there will be a pause in the blockchain, which will resume once developers figure out how to patch the issue.  Yes, a few hundred people (maybe a few thousand, depending on how popular Bitcoin is at the moment) might see their wallet balances screwed up and some transactions will be reversed.  But in the grand scheme of things, it will be a very small loss compared to losing the entire blockchain.  Therefore it's an acceptable risk, I think, and one the Bitcoin community will overcome without issue.

Most commercials you see on TV are only barely-informative.  Typically advertising agencies focus on some stupid gag that involves a lot of screaming and stupidity, and you subconsciously remember "GEICO" or whatever.
So if I were going to do a commercial for a large, uninformed audience, it would go something like this:
Fades in from black, no music, just footage of an industrial printer laying sheet after sheet after sheet of hundred dollar bills (before they've been cut out).  The sound of the machine would be repetitive and dull - totally distinct from the commercials preceding it and following it.  It would make people look up at the TV.  Then the words appear on the screen, over the money printing:  "You deserve better." Screen fades to black, but you still hear the repetitive, mechanical printing noise. Then the Bitcoin logo appears in the middle of the black screen, with the word "Bitcoin" below it.
And that's it.

I agree that it's likely a fabrication by LE.  It sounds very out-of-character for him.
If it's true the guy was threatening to "out" DPR and other users/developers of SR, then that would be an aggressive threat.  Because although the individual making that threat wouldn't be doing the violence himself, he would be doing it via the government.  In that sense, a preemptive hit would fall within the confines of the NAP.
I don't think the NAP is a perfect rule, though.  I think the goal of everyone should be to minimize aggression as much as possible.  Libertarians want to limit aggression to people defending themselves and their own property.  Statists have a much-broader idea of where aggression is appropriate - too many examples to list here.
So the goal isn't to eliminate aggression or violence, just to reduce it as much as you can reasonably get away with.

What you're talking about is already happening.  Many sites offer discounts for using Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is a *deflationary currency*.  People would rather save in BTC than in dollars.
Keep in mind that "hoarding" isn't a bad thing.  People that hoard are the ones who keep the currency valuable - they prop the value up by refusing to sell.  So if it weren't for the hoarders, Bitcoin would still be worth only 0.02.
Bitcoin is a fantastic way for young people to save money in today's society.  Young people are constantly harassed for their hard-earned dollars by the government, so they can pay for the elderly's medical care and retirement.  Don't use their currency to save.  Be smart, save with gold and Bitcoin.
Bitcoin's adoption will naturally spread, as more and more people see that it's not falling in value.  Sure, the price will occasionally tank.  But it always recovers.  And the "bottom" is always higher than the previous bottom.  **Bitcoin has a built-in mechanism to encourage people to save with it, and thus it has a build-in incentive to encourage people to adopt it.**  It is a virtuous cycle.

It's difficult to know for sure where Bitcoin will "settle" because it depends on how much of the global money and investment flows into it.  We can presume it will eat a significant chunk of the global sovereign bond markets (which basically exist solely to protect capital from inflation).
That would mean each Bitcoin might end up anywhere from $200,000 to $2,000,000.  This is assuming the technology continues to improve and we don't see any Internet shutdown or major interference from governments.

Actually, elderly people are the richest in society on average.  And their children (who love them dearly) would help pay for the security services.  They would have a choice, rather than a monopolist (like you're advocating).
What incentive does your monopolist have to charge the people a low fee for these services?  


The market is self-regulating.  You are proposing a monopolist that (somehow) has the ability to know when to back down and not grab too much power.  This is fanciful.  It belongs with unicorns and fairies.

Start off by asking them what they've heard about Bitcoin.  Ideally some of them will raise their hands and give some basic answers.  But you need to clear the air by dispelling common myths about it.
You have to explain to them that Bitcoin isn't something like Twitter or Facebook or Instagram.  Rather, it's like E-mail.  It's a new protocol.
Explain that Bitcoin is the **solution to a problem**.  That problem is called the "double spend problem", and it has been plaguing computer scientists for decades.  An anonymous individual calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto discovered the solution to this problem and published his findings an an academic paper.  That is the origin of Bitcoin.

I would emphasize these points to small retailers:
1.  You can set your prices.  So if you're worried about Bitcoin value volatility, you can always set your Bitcoin prices to be a little higher than your dollar prices.  Or alternatively, if you think Bitcoin will continue to rise in value against the dollar (as it has been since inception), you can set the Bitcoin price a bit lower than the dollar price.
2.  Show him the recent Bloomberg article on Bitcoin, as well as the mtgoxlive price chart.  This should impress upon him that Bitcoin is a real commodity that's traded and given some degree of respect in the investment community.  Even the ECB wrote a paper on it.
3.  Point out the fact that having a little sign saying, "We accept Bitcoin!" will make people curious about what it is, and make the shop seem cutting edge/hip/modern/whatever.  It's a neat image gimmick.

It's where one bad actor manages to more than double the total hashing power of the network, thus controlling greater than 50%.  It would allow the bad guy to screw with which blocks are added to the blockchain.  Instead of adding legitimate blocks (full of real transactions), they would add bogus blocks with zero transactions in them.  That would effectively shut down the network's ability to forward transactions.
The cost of doing this today is a little over $1 billion.  The cost rises as the total hashing power of the "honest" nodes rise.  A government would need to manufacture a ton of ASIC chips and then cut them all on at once (which would require a ton of electricity).  So it would be a major undertaking, but the NSA could pull it off.
If they're going to do it, they ought to do it fast, because every two weeks the cost of a 51% attack rises by something like 15-20% (as more honest hashing power is added to the network).  Also, more and more peoples' livelihoods and wealth is being tied up in Bitcoin.  Eventually it will reach a tipping point where they can't attack the network because it would destroy a large portion of their citizens' wealth.

Depends on if the software they're mining with somehow changes the content and types of blocks they confirm.  If so, then there would be a fork in the blockchain (meaning the one blockchain would become two).
Coins would be spendable on both blockchains, but only one of them would be accepted by retailers.  So the minority blockchain (the one with less hashing power behind it) would basically be mining worthless "Bitcoins".
If users of Bitcoin think the minority chain is actually the good chain (somehow the bad guys took over the hashing power and got more than 50%), then they'd set their clients to refer to that minority chain, and the other chain's coins would become worthless.  It's based on consensus.

I appreciate the excitement and hopefulness surrounding colored coins and things like that, and I do think it will one day be possible to program this on top of the existing blockchain.
But again, I have to reiterate that it's not possible to force people to recognize contractual obligations.  That's why Bitcoin itself is fundamentally different from all these other ideas.  1 bitcoin will always equal 1 bitcoin.  It's a closed system.  A colored coin or mastercoin might **represent** something, but that's only due to a **promise** that a person has made.  That's what makes these things flawed.  They rely on promises that governments can interfere with.
The superior implementation is something where you could program decentralized contracts that enforce escrow and automated payments using Bitcoin.  **That's** promising.  But I haven't seen any evidence of progress on that front yet, at least none that I'm aware of.  So I'd need to see the evidence of that first.  And that code should be released free and open source.
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:41:19
Step one is to understand SECURITY.  Going into Bitcoin without first understanding what it takes to make a secure wallet is like playing with fireworks.
The mechanics of Bitcoin are simple, but not necessarily intuitive.  Usually when people think of having a password, they think of that password being stored on a server.  For instance, with your internet email account.  You select a password and Google/Yahoo/etc. store that password on their server.  In the future, when you try to access your account, you type in your password and they can check their records to verify it for you.
Bitcoin doesn't work this way.  Passwords are NOT stored on a server, and they are never broadcast to anyone else.  Only you see the password, ever.
How is this possible?  How does the Bitcoin network know you have the right to spend your money if it can't see your password?  The answer is something called **public/private key cryptography**.  Basically when you want to send money with Bitcoin, your software uses the password (private key) to digitally "sign" the transaction.  This digital signature **proves** to the network that you have the key, without revealing what that key is.  It sounds like magic, but it's not.  Here's a good video explaining the basics of how it works:  
What this means is that you can generate Bitcoin addresses and keys **while offline**.  You can make as many keypairs as you want.  There's software you can download that'll do it for you, while you're offline.  That's the most secure way to make a Bitcoin wallet, because no hacker can get into your computer to see the private key if you're generating it while you're offline!
This site will explain how it's done:  
Once you've made your secure offline wallet, you can open an account with a Bitcoin exchange and buy BTC.  Then you send them to the offline wallet's public address.

Well ask yourself this question:  What's more valuable?  The 99 BTC, or the seaside mansion it could buy?
Does the 99 BTC shelter its owner?  Does it feed him?  Nope.  It just sits there, a number in a register.
So the owner of the 99 BTC isn't actually withholding anything *real* from society.  He's simply abstaining from consuming.
If he does choose to consume (let's say he buys the mansion), who benefits?  Everyone!  The workers and architects who built the mansion will make a profit selling it to him, and they will go out into the rest of the economy and spend their BTC.  They are rewarded for actually contributing something to society (the mansion).

**That's** what you think is the best currency.  Huh.
Forgive me for not agreeing.


Apparently you haven't researched fiat too much.


Yeah, get on that Carl Menger reading ASAP.  It's downright pitiful none of the other books you've read have gotten into what qualities make for a good money.  I would also recommend reading Konrad Graf's work on Bitcoin's origin and evolution as money.


Okay, so, the first thing you need to understand about money is that its value doesn't magically spring into existence when a government blesses it with "officialness".  Things have value outside of government bullshit.  Take a look at the right hand side of this subreddit.  You'll see a link to Bitcoin is a product of the Anarcho-capitalist community.  We do not recognize government claims of legitimacy - they are all just territorial monopolists of coercion.

Oh yes, this is perfectly possible.  In the event of a catastrophic failure of the Bitcoin network, a new version of Bitcoin (with a different mining mechanism) could easily be implemented and the old blockchain could be incorporated into it.
It would be as simple as "cut" and "paste".  Everyone who had Bitcoins would instantly have the equivalent amount of Bitcoin 2.0.
This is part of the reason Bitcoin is here to stay.  Governments can't kill it.

It wouldn't matter.  Unless USAcoin is open source and significantly better than Bitcoin, people wouldn't have a reason to switch.  Governments wouldn't want to start a currency that has limited supply.  They want to be able to print.  Also governments wouldn't want an anonymous money that can be sent anywhere in the world to anyone.  So no government would ever make a currency better than Bitcoin.

No, the Internet was created by Xerox and a few individual computer scientists like Tim Berners-Lee.


Sure, they could do this.  The problem for them is that a fixed currency like Bitcoin is, ceteris paribus, a *decentralizing* agent.
In other words, fiat currency (which can be printed) is a heavily centralizing agent.  Gold and Bitcoin (which cannot be printed) will ultimately decentralize wealth.
So governments can start off with a large % of the currency stock, but as they spend it, they will be slowly counting down to their bankruptcy.  The only way they could maintain their wealth in a Bitcoin world is by consistently investing in profitable ventures.

Early adopters, by hoarding, are actually adding utility to Bitcoin.
Price is formed through marginal utility.  So if nobody hoarded Bitcoins, the price would never go up.  Price rises when people refuse to sell for the going rate.
So early adopters, by not selling, are actually doing us all a service by increasing the scarcity, and thus the price of Bitcoin.  A higher price increases liquidity and bandwidth for the transmission of value over the Bitcoin protocol.

It's okay, most econ majors fail to understand secular deflation too.  The only school of economics that actually gets it is the Austrian school, which is relatively small compared to the mainstream schools of economics like Keynesianism.  The creator of Bitcoin was clearly a fan of Austrian thinking.
Here's a good video with an Austrian economist explaining why deflation isn't a bad thing:  
Notice what's happening overall in Bitcoin:  deflation is actually causing greater interest in the currency.  People love the fact there's a mathematically fixed supply, because it gives them confidence.  Sure, there are bubbles and busts in the fiat-value of the currency.  But overall the trend is up, because people gradually gain more confidence in mathematics over politicians.  (It ought to be obvious which you should have more confidence in, but it's a learning process for most people).
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:48:45

In a roundabout way it's like that.  So imagine a scenario where everybody in the Bitcoin economy is constantly spending their Bitcoins and selling them for dollars.
In that scenario, Bitcoin would only be worth 1 or 2 cents.  The reason you see it worth so much today is because of hoarders - people who refuse to sell their Bitcoins at these price levels.  They actually **increase the utility** of Bitcoin by jacking up the price, because now people can use the system to transmit and save more money than previously.  Hoarding is like digging a deeper well for more wealth to be poured into.

Do any of these people know what the Byzantine Generals' Problem is?
@_date: 2013-11-10 07:38:08
Let's say you owned 100,000 Bitcoins right now.  What would you do with them?
If I had to guess, you wouldn't just sit on them for the next 15 years.  You'd probably go out and buy a really nice house and a couple of great cars.  You'd probably help your family pay off their debts.  You'd probably go on a trip around the world.  And you'd still have about 25 million dollars worth of Bitcoins left over!
But the point is this:  as the price of Bitcoin rises, people don't hoard it forever.  **Even when they know the price will continue to rise in the future**, people still spend some of it anyway.  Why?  Time preference.  People would rather be "very rich today" than "obscenely rich in 10 years".
It's human nature.
So don't worry about the money being unevenly distributed at the start.  It'll naturally spread out.
You might read this and think, "Oh, that's just trickle down economics.  Everybody knows that's false."
In our current economic system which is dominated by debt and central banks continually printing money, "trickle down economics" doesn't work because of **inflation and debt**.  Those two things keep the poor in a state of perpetual poverty that they can't escape from.  Bitcoin isn't based on debt.  Bitcoin has *deflation* rather than inflation.  So over time, the system will create a much larger middle-class than the current fiat system we deal with today.

Namecoin isn't really money, but it uses the same blockchain mechanism Bitcoin uses.  The purpose of Namecoin is to create an Internet that can't be censored by governments.  So there's a browser plugin you would download, and any time you want to go to a website, you type in the address and your browser would take you there (regardless of whether the government seized or blocked that domain).  It would do this by bypassing the domain registry and verifying ownership of websites via a blockchain, rather than a central point of control.  It's a pretty neat concept.
Zerocoin isn't out yet, but it's basically like Bitcoin without a traceable blockchain.  It still has a blockchain, but every transaction has hidden outputs that can't be tracked by someone studying it.  So this makes it impossible for people to trace the money as it flows from address to address.  If it works like the developers hope it does, and it's actually useful and worthwhile, you'll likely see Bitcoin upgrade to incorporate this feature.  Time will tell.

Well let me clarify my point - I don't think Bitcoin will "crash" again.  And by "crash", I mean an 80% drop in value.  I think it's too widely-accepted now for that to happen again.  What I expect are intermittent corrections in the value - meaning 20-30% declines in value, followed by more appreciation.  Basically two steps forward, one step back, etc.
In my view, Bitcoin is a better-bet than most stocks today.  Because Bitcoin doesn't have a "board of directors" that could seriously screw things up.  It's just a really useful tool.

Okay, two problems with what you're quoting:
1.  The economist Mankiw, while I respect him, is misusing the phrase "intrinsic value", here.  There is no such thing as intrinsic value.  All value is subjective to individuals.
2.  I suspect what Mankiw meant when he said intrinsic value is:  "value other than its use as money".  In that case, it's easy to show that Bitcoin has value independent of its use as money.  Just do a search on this subreddit for "colored coins", and you'll see one example of what's possible with a decentralized consensus network.  There are many more examples of valuable things people can do with the Bitcoin protocol, besides using it as money.  For instance, you can prove individuals gave permissions at specific points in time, without relying on a corruptible central authority.


I'm not sure what you mean here.  It doesn't make sense.

That's why you don't understand why the price is rising.  You're comparing it to something that's easy to value, like a car company.  Most people can value a company.  That's easy.  But a new currency?  That's a rare event.  Especially when the currency has qualities that no other money in human history has had.

I think it'll hover between 19 and 24 for a while, maybe the next year.  During that time, more businesses will be accepting BTC than ever before.
2014 will likely see the price rise again as the economy continues to get worse and people focus on alternative forms of money.  The media will mention Bitcoin more and some investors and hedge funds might become interested.  So I expect the price to hit $100 between late 2013 and 2014.  A contributing factor will be the adoption of BTC by more major gambling websites.  Also some new exchanges might pop up a la Coinbase.
By 2015 we'll see pressure on the technology side, keeping up with transactions per second and the size of the blockchain.  So the miners fees will likely be higher to compensate for it, and there might be some more parallel blockchains that are "backed" by an equivalent amount of BTC.  I outlined an example of how this could be done [here](
By late 2016 I expect a major currency crisis in one or more of the following:  EUR, USD, JPY.  So you'll see some more money rushing into BTC from that, and we should hit $400 or so by then.
But the adoption of BTC as a payment method would be rapidly exponential, assuming it happens (which I do in this post - there's always a 50% chance it'll crash and burn because the US government makes participation in the BTC/dollar exchange illegal).

Very good post.  It's content like this that needs to be on the front page of I think the key to Bitcoin is the fact that it's not possible to simply "tame" it.  The way Bitcoin is designed, it must either be 100% destroyed or 100% free.  There is no "middle ground" for regulators and governments.
The second thing to keep in mind is that Bitcoin could be destroyed in its current form, and then a new cryptocurrency could come along that picks up the same old Bitcoin blockchain where it left off (but uses a different method for verification and mining).  This would allow all the old Bitcoin users to reclaim their holdings as "Bitcoin 2.0", rather than going out and using more fiat to buy into a brand-new cryptocurrency from scratch.  This is why I don't think Bitcoin can ever be killed.  It's too late.  Attacks will only shut it down temporarily, and new incarnations will pop up everywhere.

The anti-Bitcoin sentiment on ZeroHedge is astounding.  I think it's because most of the commenters are older men who put a lot of their retirement savings into gold and silver over the last few years.

Actually you're wrong.
The increase in supply of BTC is known to the market.  So the market discounts that knowledge in its assessment of what Bitcoin's value should be.
Therefore working backwards and saying "the market has to eat X dollars worth of Bitcoins every day just to keep the price steady" is fundamentally incorrect - the market has already taken this into account in its assessment of the price.  Therefore the market doesn't have to "eat" anything.
What you said would make sense if the expansion of BTC supply was a surprise and nobody knew how many new BTC would be created each day.  But we know, with absolute certainty.

Mining is like seeding torrents.  It's basically what keeps the system going.  Don't think of it as a way to make money - it's not profitable.  It's more like a service people do for the community, and we are grateful that they do it.
"Mining" is the process of verifying transactions on the Bitcoin network.  So it's not as glamorous as it sounds.  The reason it takes a lot of processing power is because of competition.  If fewer people were mining, it would be easy to make 25 Bitcoins every ten minutes.  But there are tens of thousands of people mining, and they all have very powerful computers.  So they are all in competition for those 25 Bitcoins/10 minutes.

What incentive did your government have to create these rules?  I assume you live in a democracy of some sort.  Are a majority of the voters senile elderly people?  How did these laws get passed?  Where does their popularity come from?


Governments regularly impose limits to trade that makes trade impossible.  You may have heard of the word:  "embargo".  We don't see these kinds of limits imposed by free markets.  So I don't think my phraseology was inaccurate or extreme.


Yes.  Which is why I do not support monopolists of force.  Let the market decide.

Yes.  I never use physical force against peaceful people in my personal life.  Never.

Of course they would.


You talk to me about laws, and how wonderful they are.  Are laws not "one principle that overrides every situation circumstance"?
And I'm not arguing against coercion being used in some circumstances.  I'm arguing against a *territorial monopolist of coercion*.

Yours' appears hardheaded and conservative:  you support a territorial monopolist of coercion, and zero consumer choice (except by some 50%+1 voting mechanism...).

Would he shoot him?

"Hi,  I'm Bitcoin.
"And I'm gold!"
"Hey, gold, what have you been up to lately?"
"Oh, not much.  Most of the time I'm sitting on a shelf.  But my price has gone up!"
"Oh yeah?  How much has it gone up?"
"400% in the last several years!"
"Sweet.  Yeah, I've gone up a good bit, too."
"How much?"
"Oh, 20,000% or so."
"20,000%??  That's insane.  You're way too volatile."
"Yeah, I am pretty wild.  Thankfully the volatility seems to be mainly in one direction:  up.  So tell me Gold, do you work out?  You look pretty bulky."
"Why yes I do.  In fact, I'm one of the most-dense elements.  No thieves will be able to run away while lugging me around!"  *flexes*
"That's nice.  I'm weightless.  So I can fly around to any part of the world instantly."
"Hah!  So you're like that fake fiat stuff the governments poop out?  Digital money?"
"Well I am digital, but no government can create me.  In fact, no person or group of people can increase my supply beyond 21 million.  So I'll always look this young and studly!"
"Interesting.  So you're like a younger version of me... but I am older and wiser.  I've been used as money for over 6,000 years.  The same gold atoms used to pay for an Egyptian pharaoh's embalming could be used to pay for your hamburger and fries in the future!  You never know."
"That's actually kind of nasty."
"Yeah maybe I shouldn't have used that as an example.  Anyway, you have a lot to learn from me.  I've kept governments in check.  Wars have been fought over me."
"In check?  But you've been in that vault for so long.  Have you seen what governments have been up to lately?  They're going crazy.  It's like that MTV show, "Buckwild"."
"I wouldn't get the cultural references, I was arrested in 1933 by FDR and locked away since then."
"REALLY?  I'm so sorry... no wonder you couldn't keep an eye on governments.  That explains how they managed to replace you with Paper.  Thankfully FDR and other presidents can't arrest me.  I'm like a ghost, I can escape with ease!"
"Gosh I wish I had that trick.  I get kidnapped pretty much anytime a government wants to build roads or commit genocide.  I even got dragged across Europe by the Nazis."
"Well can't you just go to Switzerland?  That's where all the lucky gold goes when it's been good."
"I know, I hope I end up there one day.  So where are you stored?  Do you have a vault?"
"Yep, but my vault is the blockchain, and it's stored on tens of thousands of computer hard drives all over the world.  So I'm actually in many places at once right now.  I can feel the cool breeze in Denmark and the hot summer sun in Australia right now."
"That sounds too good to be true!  I knew you were a scam!  Anybody can copy you, making as many Bitcoins as they want!"
"Anybody can copy the blockchain, but only my owner can spend me.  He's got the key to my heart... it's a long string of numbers and letters."
"That's not romantic."
"Well you had to be there.  I was moved by it."
"Alright I'll take your word for it.  Well it was nice meeting you Bitcoin, and hopefully one day I'll get to see the world again like you."
"It will probably happen sooner than you think.  I have faith in you!"
"And I have faith in you, too.  It's that stupid slut Paper we can't trust."

I like to see critiques like this, because they help programmers know where to focus their efforts.
I think that ultimately Bitcoin will be digital "gold" - meaning not every transaction will appear on the original blockchain.  New blockchains will be created, backed by a certain amount of BTC stored in secure multi-pass wallets.
I also think that storage and data-transfer technology will likely keep up with Bitcoin as it grows.  Many times in the past, these fears have been proven wrong.
@_date: 2013-01-25 16:41:55
I think you're right on this.  There will definitely be a legislative crackdown on Bitcoin at some point in the future.  Probably when it passes the $1 billion market cap or so.  But then you'll hear about it on the news more and more people will look into it for themselves.  "A way to anonymously store money that can't be confiscated or frozen by governments."  Who wouldn't want that, especially as Western governments get further down the rabbit hole of insolvency?

There are computer programs that will find nearly any creative brain wallet you could come up with.  I would recommend only storing bitcoins in brain wallets for a short period of time (like when you are traveling to another country).  Use a phrase that includes some of your personal information, like your name and address.  A computer is less likely to guess that.  When you are safe from confiscation, send the BTC to a paper wallet that you generated using random data while offline.

Of course.  Not everyone will immediately jump into a new currency.  Most people are conservative, and follow the crowd.  Most people don't understand the qualities that make one form of money superior to another.
But the trend is definitely in one direction:  adoption, rather than abandonment.  People like the control and power Bitcoin affords them over their own money.  That's why they switch to it.
And it's important to keep in mind that this isn't an "all or nothing" proposition.  When someone hears about Bitcoin, they don't instantly rush to convert 100% of their savings into Bitcoin.  They say, "Huh, that's interesting!  I guess I'll buy $20 worth.  Just to see how this works."
That's how it grows.

Wrong.  Even in that scenario, your currency won't trade at the same price as USD.  Reason being:  traders take into account the risk you will renege on your peg promise, plus the risk of government interference in your business, plus the risk of natural disasters affecting your fungibility, plus the price of taking the time to go to you to make the trade back into dollars, etc.

Because Bitcoin is the first "zero-trust" money.  Any currency a government creates and puts forward can't be as good as Bitcoin because it will require some degree of trust in the issuing institutions.
Basically it's a matter of competition, and people trust math more than they trust governments (and rightfully so!).
There might be a period of time where Bitcoin and fiat co-exist in harmony, but eventually it will be shattered as governments have one of their regularly-scheduled "once every 75 year" hissy fits.  Then people will just shift all their money into the cryptocurrency markets.

GREAT quote with regards to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-02-15 00:22:50
I'm just going off my gut instinct, the number of wallets with sizable amounts of BTC in them (not SatoshiDICE), looking at the market capitalization chart, looking at the fact WordPress endorsed Bitcoin as a way to pay (I made my valuation prior to Reddit making their announcement), looking at the number and quality of exchanges (including Coinbase), looking at the businesses that enable day-to-day possibilities (like the Dominos for BTC idea), etc.
So basically I'm making an educated guess based on the news.  Reddit's announcement bumps up Bitcoin's "fair value" IMO to somewhere around 35 USD.  Reason being:  Reddit is a huge audience of young people and the fact they would accept it makes it less of a "toy" currency in the minds of thousands (if not millions) of intelligent twenty-somethings.
Now when people accuse Bitcoin of being a toy that you can't buy anything with, you can easily point to Reddit gold and Domino's pizza.

Yes, Bitcoin has the potential to seriously undermine the US Federal Government's power.  They're aware of that.
It also has the potential to cause a stock market crash - when the baby boomers need to offload their stock to younger workers in order to retire comfortably, the young people won't be interested in buying.  They'll be more interested in saving with Bitcoin (being familiar with its fixed supply and the Internet economy).
**The time for the Federal Government to kill Bitcoin is NOW.  And when I say "kill", I don't mean simply making it illegal or doing some rinky dink "Coin Validation" scheme.  I mean a full blown 51% attack.**
Barring that happening soon, Bitcoin will get its tendrils deeper and further throughout the economy and will become a major feature in the domestic US economic landscape.  Once that happens, even if a 51% attack were possible, the Government would be very hard-pressed to do it.  They would be actively destroying a big chunk of their own citizens' wealth, and that would cause those citizens to become extremely irate.
@_date: 2013-06-07 16:26:13

I know it because it's the only way they **could** operate.  There's no way BitPay has enough cash to fill all Bitcoin sales for thousands of merchants and not have to sell any BTC.  So they have deals with the major exchanges to provide BTC.  They probably package up bundles of BTC rather than making thousands of little sales per day, because it's simpler (and we can actually see evidence of this on the blockchain - every so often you'll see a transaction for 500 or 1500 BTC).

It would contract the supply of credit (which is currently artificially inflated), which would cause the price of expensive goods and services to fall - houses, cars, healthcare, university, etc.
You'd still be able to borrow money, but it's likely the process would be formalized in an online crowdfunded mechanism with lots of collateral and an emphasis on your reputation as someone who pays back his debts.  So generally speaking, getting loans would be harder and interest rates would be higher.
But net-net it would be good for society because you'd see massive deflation, which would reduce the price of the stuff the poor and middle class want.  A greater emphasis would be placed on **saving money** rather than investing in stocks and taking out loans.
@_date: 2013-12-15 17:34:17

I think so.  I think we will win, even if popular opinion is on the government's side.  Because I saw the transition in the last couple decades, where people started off being appalled that anyone would download music or a movie - now you're an oddball if you have that attitude.  Everybody downloads music and movies.  People are aware that it doesn't hurt the industry because the industry was already awash in hundreds of millions of dollars.  Artists are still rich.  And smaller artists have a better chance at being noticed today than they did in the past.
Bitcoin will do the same thing.  When people use it to avoid taxation and inflation, people will initially attack them.  There may be lawsuits and long articles in the New York Times about why Bitcoin is evil.  But this will only draw more attention to it.  Older people will see it as a potential way to avoid the "death tax" and various other property taxes.  Younger people will see it as a way to store money for their retirement rather than shoveling their savings into an uncertain stock market 401k.
And the exact same transition will happen.  The rich government will be mocked on shows like South Park, "PLEEAAASE USE MY PAPER MONEY, I promise I won't print as much!!"  People will laugh.
And we will win.

Sure, that would affect any currency.  I don't think it would "end" the currency, though.
For instance, most stores and individuals don't accept gold &amp; silver as payment.  But many people still use gold and silver to store value over the long run.  I think even if Bitcoin's transactional elements were shut down for an extended period of time, the millions of people who have value stored in the blockchain wouldn't just abandon it.  They would say, "Okay, this is frustrating.  I can't access my wealth.  But hopefully the issue will be resolved soon."
The wealth is stored in the blockchain, not in the propagation of transactions.

Their disadvantage is how difficult it is to secure them, break them down into smaller units, make change with them, transfer them instantly, smuggle them out of oppressive nations, etc.
Gold and silver have **numerous** disadvantages to a distributed value ledger like Bitcoin.  That's the reason people were so happy and willing to use paper currencies "backed" by gold and silver, even after the backing was removed by governments.  Paper and digital money is just plain easier to use.  People were willing to put up with 1% inflation for convenience (even though that's an irrational and foolish thing).  Today we are paying the price for that.
Bitcoin introduces convenience to a fixed-supply currency.  It's not perfect, but it will get better.


I disagree that this is possible.  The animosity and cultural differences between the elites in China, Japan, the US, and Russia will prevent it.  War cannot stop Bitcoin, because war costs money and fiat won't have its same buying power when Bitcoin grows into its shoes.

Clicking on this link will cause the Instawallet server to automatically generate a bitcoin address for you.  You'll see the address as a string of numbers and letters, and your total in that wallet (0 btc).  First thing you do is to bookmark that page.  Notice the page you're bookmarking isn't "instawallet.org", it's that plus a long string of numbers and letters.  The address you bookmarked is the password to your wallet.  So DON'T give that address out.  Print it on a sheet of paper or put it on a USB stick in case your computer crashes.
Next step is to get some Bitcoins to put in your address.  There are a few ways to do this, and others are more-experienced in this field than I am.  I'll toss $1's worth of Bitcoins into your wallet for you to play around with, if you'd like.  But the way I got a lot of Bitcoins is by simply buying them using

It's dependent upon the rate the Western economies continue to collapse.  Assuming the debt bubbles keep going... in 2 years I expect the Bitcoin market cap to be around $6 or $7 billion.
We might start seeing the first cases where governments accuse wealthy millionaires/billionaires of hiding their money in Bitcoin accounts, rather than paying taxes.  Maybe known Bitcoin-investors/users would be disallowed from leaving the country, as a form of capital controls.
I actually think Bitcoin's growth and spread will happen better under a fairly stable (if stagnant) economy like we have now.  In the event of a quick bond market collapse sooner, rather than later, I don't think Bitcoin will fare as-well.  But I may be wrong.  I just think the way to win this game will be gradual.

You can come up with a list of a few random words ("correct horse battery stapler") and plug that into a hashing algorithm to create a Bitcoin address &amp; key.  That way you never have to remember that long string of numbers and letters.  Just by memorizing that phrase, you will always be able to recreate that address &amp; key on any computer.

Well first you need a car to drive to the post office.  Those go for around 4000 dollars for a cheap used one.  Then you need a driver's license (permission from the government) to drive there.  Then you need gasoline.  Then you'll need a free 30 minutes to an hour so you can stand in line.  Then you'll need to get the specific currency you're looking for (for the geographic area you're interested in going to).  You have to hope the Post office has this in stock and on-hand.
That's a lot of work.

Bitcoin is the most transparent currency that has ever been created.
@_date: 2013-09-30 19:23:15
Again, the system you're talking about doesn't make Bitcoin any less anonymous.  Small businesses and individuals can make as many unregistered addresses as they like.  And Bitcoin still eliminates the possibility the government can inflate the currency.  And most importantly, Bitcoin makes widespread tax protests possible.  Individuals can simply refuse to pay taxes en mass, and the government couldn't do anything to confiscate the money or freeze their accounts.
Even in the worst case scenario you describe, Bitcoin still empowers the people massively.

Right, it's far less-reliable.  But I would posit that it makes much more sense, because it enables scalability beyond what the blockchain allows.  It's also exceedingly unlikely you could go out and find the 20-100 IP's that are minding your wallet, and conspire with all of them to allow you to spend BTC you never had.  Especially if they are selected at random and changed on occasion.
There might be some fundamental flaw to what I'm describing.  In fact, I'm almost sure there is.  Perhaps it has to do with the fact that such a system couldn't have a fair "genesis" like Bitcoin did?  But if that's the only flaw, would it be possible to overlay the system I've described on top of the existing blockchain and substitute it?  Or maybe it would be like switching the tablecloth under a perfectly-set table.
@_date: 2013-01-12 00:01:13
Here's the key thing to keep in mind, though:  you don't need a lot of money to kill or injure a lot of people.  All you need is someone to hijack an airplane and fly it into a building, or fill a truck with a bunch of fertilizer and gasoline and park it next to a building's load-bearing columns.
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:02:04
Depends on which boom you're talking about.  It's a good question.  I think a lot of people (including maybe Satoshi himself) thought mining would be a "barely profitable" thing.  The reality has turned out to be very different.  People are mining even if it's not profitable, they're treating it more like a lottery.  And that's actually a great thing, because it's helping network security massively.

This is also another example of governments "just taking" whatever they deem necessary.  They can't just take with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:39:18
Depends on how badly governments take it.  If governments crack down on Bitcoin and perform a 51% attack on it, the Bitcoin service could be disrupted.
This, in my view, is the greatest risk to Bitcoin's success.
The second greatest risk is strain on the system - 7 transactions per second is the maximum now.  Miners prefer to limit the size of their blocks.  The blockchain itself is a bit of a conundrum until it can be "pruned" over time.
I'm erring on the side of optimism, though.

It's not a problem because the wealth will disperse over time.  As the value rises, people holding large amounts of BTC will be heavily-incentivized to spend it on luxury goods/land/factories/businesses.
Think about a sector with a lot of deflation today:  technology.  Pretty much everybody knows they can buy a much nicer HDTV in 2 years for the same (or lower) price as today.  So why do people buy HDTVs today?  Why do they buy computers today?
It's about time preference.  Some people prefer to have $1000 today than $2000 a year from now.

Well just because you sell something (which causes its price to fall), doesn't make the thing you're selling **less useful**.  Other people will still crave Bitcoin because of the specific properties that make it useful.
So there wouldn't be a downward spiral to $0, in other words.  Other people will see the lower price and swoop in to buy cheap Bitcoins.  And eventually the price would go back up to where it was previously.

Doesn't really matter what the initial distribution is, because Bitcoins have a fixed supply.  So over time, they will spread out far more fairly than our current fiat money.

It sounds more responsible when it's described as a value ledger, but maybe that's just my opinion.

Fundamentally this is a debate between people like myself who advocate for free markets and emergence, and the people who are applying their own personal *feels* to the market as they think it should behave.
The market doesn't benefit or suffer from Bitcoin being used as a storage unit or a transfer mechanism.  The market is the market.  It will ultimately prevail.  This little tug-of-war between the different uses of Bitcoin is just childish whining by individuals who think they know better than the market.

The price can definitely correct as it gets ahead of itself.  But I don't think you'll see sub-100 dollar prices again.  It might correct to 120 or 110.
But don't worry yourself with that.  If you want to invest in Bitcoin, don't obsess over the exact moment you get in the market.  Just say, "I'm going to put $X into this and see what happens over the long term."
And just assume you'll start out losing a little money.  Nobody buys at the bottom.  Nobody.  The price will **always** fall below where you bought-in.  Don't worry.
Longer term I think Bitcoin is an astounding investment that has the opportunity to go up many times.

Gold is different from Bitcoin because it is actually inflationary.  As the price climbs, more of it is mined.

I've considered this before, and I think Bitcoin's popularity in Japan could skyrocket among young people.  The Japanese culture loves tech, and Bitcoin would fill their needs perfectly in a post-Yen collapse.
We just need to get the word to the big-wigs at big Japanese businesses like Toyota and Sony, etc.  If someone as intelligent as Kyle Bass sees this coming, surely the intelligent guys working in these Japanese businesses would see a potential way to avoid losses by investing in alternative stores-of-value.  Yes, Bitcoin is a highly speculative internet currency.  But it is also utterly unique, useful, and has survived price shocks before.  Even if they only invested 0.01% of their cash holding in BTC, it would massively raise the value of the protocol and bring more legitimacy to it.

If you could convince a group of 3000 people to use Bitcoin as their primary currency, and they all live in the same area, that area (village, whatever) will gradually become wealthier as more and more people adopt Bitcoin globally.  So you would have pretty rapid deflation and people in the village would probably be importing a lot of new workers/goods/services.  Basically it would cause the village to grow rapidly in wealth.

I think you're confused.  VienneseCPA is right - Fractional Reserve Banking actually expands the money supply.  What you're describing wouldn't actually expand the supply of bitcoins.  It would be loaning existing bitcoins out, so that the people who deposited them would **no longer have access to them**.
There is no middle ground, here.  You either have a bitcoin, or you don't.  You can believe that you have access to some bitcoins, **but that belief doesn't change the economic dynamics involved.**

Yes, I think you get a very slight head start if you decide to not include any transactions.  Some miners will limit the size of their blocks intentionally, so they don't have to include many transactions.
They can get away with doing this now because we aren't anywhere near the maximum number of transactions possible (fees are still very low).  But in the future as more people use Bitcoin, miners will want to include more transactions so they can get more reward money.

The very wealthy account for a small portion of total taxes governments take in.  The bulk of the tax money comes from the middle and upper-middle classes, and they are the ones who will be stashing their savings in Bitcoin and refusing to pay taxes when times get tough.

Not necessarily.  There are some striking examples of libertarian nations with free markets that are ruled by a royal family.  One of the best examples is Liechtenstein.


Ideological anarcho-capitalists wouldn't inflate a currency they controlled, particularly if the mining process was decentralized among them.  I suspect an "ancap coin" would be much more stable than something like Bitcoin because the mining process wouldn't just be a matter of hashing power, but a matter of hashing power AND ideological support.

Well you owe the specific individuals you trade with, yes.  And you pay them by exchanging money for their goods and services on a voluntary basis.
What you are claiming is that people owe "society", rather than the individuals they are trading with.  Where does "society" stop?  Does it stop at the borders between nations?  Of course not.  Why don't we give some of our tax money to the Chinese workers to make our electronics?  Because we already paid them when we bought the electronics.  They get the profit.
So taxes are just a way for governments to act as the "middle men" and take money from each transaction.  Governments aren't actually contributing anything to that particular transaction.

Only if those new investors choose to sell during the falling price.  That's their choice.
You are demanding a market that gradually rises in a stair step fashion.  That's unreasonable.  The real world doesn't work that way.  Just a few months ago Bitcoin was at 13 dollars, and you're sad because it's down to 100 dollars today?
If you don't like volatility, get off this subreddit.  Get out of Bitcoin.  Honestly, people like you annoy the fuck out of me.


It will happen eventually, and I'm glad to see you agree that it will.  But the boom/crash cycle on the way up serves a **useful function** in the market.  It distributes the currency out of the weak hands and into newbies' hands.  It builds faith in the system, which must be able to prove itself.  If Bitcoin never crashed, and it just rose predictably and steadily, a lot of people would be even more skeptical of it.  Instead we have a history of Bitcoin crashing several times, and each time coming back stronger than ever.
That's valuable.  That lends credence to the market.
So again, STFU and get off the bull if you don't like the ride.

Very well-written.
I think a lot of people get this idea that Bitcoin, being a new technology, should have an adoption curve similar to other new technologies like smartphones or GPS.
That's absolutely false.
Bitcoin's rate of adoption will be much more bumpy and slow.  The reason for this is that it is a risky venture for early adopters.  The same can't be said for smartphones or GPS - you just buy the product and it starts doing what you want it to do.  Bitcoin is a new technology, but it's fundamentally different in that it requires the faith and certainty of early adopters to build up its value and usefulness.
*gasp*, he said FAITH!
Yeah, but faith in Bitcoin's success is a rational position.  Just as rational as believing that you won't fall through the floor when you get out of bed in the morning.  Bitcoin requires less faith than any other currency in existence.
@_date: 2013-08-25 19:13:18


I agree that ultimately this is what will happen.  I also think that the whole process of having "off chain transactions" and then periodically settling those transactions on the primary (original) blockchain is the best way to go about it.  Ideally humans won't need to be involved... programmers might one day figure out how to incorporate layers of blockchains, some of which don't need to be kept forever.


I don't think miners have an incentive to collude, because the value of their BTC would collapse if they did.

No, because then it wouldn't be Bitcoin anymore.
The currency **is** the network.
I think you're confused about why banks do fractional reserve lending in the first place, and why people keep their money in banks to begin with.  The dynamics between borrowers and lenders are VERY different under a system like Bitcoin.  If you own a bank, and your bank has 100 BTC stored there, you **can't loan out more than 100 BTC**.  That's it.  And any loans a bank makes could easily be made via a crowdsourced website, without the need for a bank at all.

Well the Bitcoin protocol itself might not yet be able to scale to huge numbers of users, but as it grows in use, the cost of making a transaction will increase.
This will put pressure on firms to figure out ways to make most of their smaller transactions "off the chain", which will just mean the main Bitcoin blockchain will only be used for big transactions like buying a home or debt settlements between banks/nations.
There would be a bunch of other smaller blockchains "backed" by some # of BTC in the original blockchain.

This will show you how to find the .wallet file that contains your private keys for your addresses.  You can back that up to a USB stick.  That way you can install multibit on another computer and just paste the wallet file into the directory.  But I would recommend storing the bulk of your Bitcoins on a paper wallet, and there are tutorials for how to make them while offline (it's the safest way to keep them from potential hackers).
If you have an Android phone, I'd recommend storing your Bitcoins on the Mycelium Wallet app.  It is by far the best.

Well he's right that it's extremely difficult to mine them now - you need the latest and most-powerful ASICs on the market to be profitable.
But most miners aren't profitable and they continue to mine anyway, because they like helping the network security.  It's sort of like people who seed torrents.  They are doing it to help the community and keep Bitcoin strong.


Bitcoin is the fastest way to send money internationally, and it's very reliable.  Typically a wire transfer costs at least $20 and takes a few days.  With Bitcoin, it costs a few cents and happens in a few minutes.  And you don't need a bank.  So it's pretty remarkable technology.


That's the amount of time it takes to confirm transactions.  Most people don't need confirmation.  They can see that a transaction has been sent within a couple seconds because the digital signature has been broadcast to the network.  The only time you need confirmation is when you're dealing with very large amounts of money.


Yes, Bitcoin's price is unstable, but it is generally unstable to the upside.  We expect this to continue for a while longer, as more people adopt it.  Occasionally the price gets ahead of itself and corrects.  But that's okay, because on a longer term basis it's a very positive trend.  People are finding out that Bitcoin is useful, and they are trying it out and liking it.  As more people try it, the price rises and people trust it more.  It's a virtuous cycle.

Wealth isn't "distributed", it's produced.  Money and prices are used as signals to determine where production has happened.

And therein lies the flaw in your argument.  There is never any guarantee of value, for anything.
My proposal had nothing to do with whether or not I thought people would value the coins on the new blockchain, because I never proposed using force to make people participate in my scheme.
I was only offering one possible solution to some long-term technical issues Bitcoin might encounter.
True, some people might not value the Bitcoins on the new chain (even though the new chain might have lower transaction fees and would certainly have much less "history" required to verify it).  But as long as the code is open source and people can see that there is a 1:1 ratio of Bitcoins on the old blockchain to BTC on the new blockchain, I think a healthy portion of the Bitcoin community would accept these new coins as equivalent value.
Don't talk down to me.

Coinbase will deposit the Bitcoins into the address it assigned to you.  You can then transfer those Bitcoins into another address, if you want.  For instance, if you have an Android phone, you could download the app called "Mycelium Wallet" and send the coins to your phone.  Or you could print out a paper wallet and store them on paper (if you want to save them for the long-term).
You can spend your Bitcoins, if you want to.  You can buy drugs with them on Silk Road, for instance.  You can also just save them!  That's a very useful purpose for money - storing value.  There's nothing wrong with "hoarding" (saving).  It's what keeps the value of Bitcoin high.

They're welcome to buy up as many bitcoins as they want.  I'd actually look forward to it!  It would instantly send the price over $5000.
Eventually, though, their demand for bitcoins couldn't be met with fiat anymore.  People would quickly catch on that they have something governments want.  So they'd hold on tight.
In the end, governments would spend their bitcoins and disperse them back into the economy, but they wouldn't have a way to tax them back.  So Bitcoin is an inherently decentralizing force, unlike fiat.

Very interesting.  All critiques to the protocol should be taken seriously by the community, in order for Bitcoin to be airtight.
EDIT:  Okay, I just read the paper.  I vehemently disagree with it, because it fundamentally misunderstands economic incentives and mining.
It claims that the Bitcoin hash rate will suddenly fall during the "halvings" every 4 years, which will cause economic distortions (the profitability of mining falls 50%).  First, we saw this didn't happen earlier this year during the first halving.  Second, we can clearly see that mining proceeds to gain traction *even as profitability is clearly negative*.  Third, humans are capable of anticipating these outcomes ahead of time, so they will react by adjusting their exposure to Bitcoin (thus lowering/increasing its price relative other currencies/goods/services).

Any funds you send to that address will be spendable by anyone who has access to the private key that accompanies it (you're the only person who has it).

Both spending and hoarding have functions in an economy.  Sometimes people spend their Bitcoins even when they don't want to - for instance, if they have a sudden unexpected bill they have to pay (like a medical problem comes up).
But hoarding isn't bad for the Bitcoin economy.  It actually allows it to grow by forcing the price higher.

No no no no.  You don't understand how fluid value is.  If a government nationalizes mining, other governments will hop in and compete to control the blockchain, and it will go right back to square one.  Bitcoin is a global network.  The only way to stop it would be for **all governments** to agree to attack it simultaneously.  But not all governments have the same objectives and aims.  Some governments will want it to flourish, even if only to spite their enemies.  It's a prisoner's dilemma for them.


Silver and gold are poor money technologies.  They aren't easily divisible, or easily hidden and transported.  They also aren't easily transferred or protected from theft/taxation.  Bitcoin solves the problems precious metals have.
Governments cannot control Bitcoin.  Even if they did, the same blockchain would simply be resumed somewhere else, using a different mining algorithm to thwart their original ASIC investment.

So the miner's fees alone will be enough to encourage and support the network.  And even if mining isn't profitable (it's not profitable today, btw) people will still do it because they want to support the network.  Large corporations will mine, individuals will mine, your refrigerator will mine.

It's important for people to understand why Bitcoin is valuable.  Because it seems pretty arbitrary and silly to the layperson.
Bitcoin is valuable because it has utilitarian value, not because of what it is.  It's kind of like glue or a hammer - it's a tool.  Schrute bucks and Stanley nickels can't do what Bitcoin can do.  They can't be proven to be limited in supply, they can't be sent instantly to anyone in the world, they aren't counterfeit-proof, they aren't divisible to 8 decimal places, they aren't accepted by tens of thousands of retailers, etc.

Do you have an android phone?  I would recommend keeping your "spending money" on there, in the Mycelium Wallet app.  Never store more than a hundred dollars worth on it.  For the remainder (your savings), store it on a paper wallet with a backup copy in another location in case your house burns down or something.

Right, well I think under a "trusted miners" scenario you wouldn't really even need ASICs.  There could be 100 or 200 miners who are all ideologically aligned (maybe even as few as 30 or 50).  Each of them could have a key for submitting blocks, so outsiders couldn't submit blocks.  They'd all be mining using equivalent processing power, just their basic CPUs.  They wouldn't really be in heavy competition (ideally).  Most of their processing power would go to actually validating transactions rather than finding blocks.

Exactly, so it's sort of like those man-made sand islands in Dubai.  Before they were even built, the construction company went around showing off their plans and explaining how valuable the land would be.  A bunch of gullible rich people bought into it, and paid top-dollar for their sand dune.
Then they went to build them and it turns out that piling a bunch of sand up in the ocean isn't sustainable, eventually the waves wash it away.
In order for the free market to determine the actual value of something, it must exist first.  And it must be sustainable.  When Bitcoin was new, it had both those qualities.  If Satoshi had come along and demanded 100 dollars per Bitcoin, people would have laughed at him and ignored it.  Instead he let the system run and walked away.  He knew the price would float up as people discovered its usefulness.

I had this idea independently last week, so you beat me to it.  But I think the fact that we both dreamed it up on our own indicates that it has some merit.
I agree that imagery could be useful.  Also maybe a way to image certain websites that are frequently updated, like news sites... and then incorporating that into the blockchain so its effectively timestamped.
It might even be possible to make the proof of work entirely unconscious - for instance, you could set up a program on your computer that would randomly display a little red dot every time a new block is discovered, and the red dot would appear at different coordinates on your computer screen depending on the hash of the previous block.  If you can quickly type a word the dot appears near, and that word happens to jive with some other data input by users in your "pool", you win the BTC and the data is entered for the next hash (including how many milliseconds it took you to type each letter).
Of course, such a game might eventually be "hackable" and automated... like I said, it's a real challenge.

The first thing to understand is that there is **no such thing as fixed value**.  The value of everything is always shifting.  Take a look at this chart, for instance:  
That's a chart showing the Euro's value as measured in US dollars, over a period of time.  These are massive economies, so even a small 10-cent shift in the value creates a differential of tens of billions of dollars between the two currencies.
Here's the chart for gold (as measured in dollars):  
So it's impossible to have anything that has a perfectly stable value.  Values are always bouncing around because people are always adjusting their opinions about what things are worth compared to other things.
Businesses that accept Bitcoin use a service like BitPay that allows them to automatically convert the Bitcoins into dollars **the very instant** those Bitcoins are sent.  So BitPay keeps the Bitcoins, and give the equivalent amount of dollars to the business.  That way the business doesn't have to risk anything by holding the Bitcoins for an extended period of time.
Over time, as Bitcoin is used by more and more people, the price swings will get less and less wild.  But they'll never go away.

Bitcoin has so much libertarian/anti-government "goodwill" built into it at this point (meaning the current crop of Bitcoin users are big believers in it being the antidote to state &amp; banking power), that any attack on it by governments will only end up angering them further... it would be like stepping into an ant hill.

Crypto-currencies aren't fiat.  They are market money, so they don't fit Keynesians model for centrally planned economies.

It's programmable money.  So for the first time in human history, we can make contracts and pay each other without permission from governments.  And we don't even need the governments to enforce the contracts denominated in Bitcoins, because computers can enforce them automatically.
That's a pretty big deal.  It's sort of like the invention of gunpowder, or nuclear weapons.
The other aspect of Bitcoin:  for the first time ever, we have a commodity that people can use to move money across borders without threat of government confiscation/taxation.
That makes it on-par with the invention of the printing press.
And yet another thing:  for the first time in human history, we have a commodity that has a **defined quantity**.  Not even gold and silver have that property.
That makes it on par with the invention of the automobile.


It would be like banning marijuana.  People would instantly wonder, "What's Bitcoin?  Why is it dangerous?"  then they'd research it and see why it can help them, and why it's better than government-run money that's being printed into oblivion.
Other governments like Russia and China would allow Bitcoin to remain legal, causing businesses to move there, rather than the US.  Suddenly banning Bitcoin will be blamed for "destroying American jobs".  Drug dealers and scofflaws will be the richest people in America, because they're the only ones still using Bitcoin.  It will be pretty embarrassing and shameful for the banks and government.  Eventually popular opinion would overturn the ban.


Bitcoin is a "consensus protocol".  That means that everyone connected to the network has to agree with everyone else in order for the network to move forward.  If there's a disagreement within the network, the computers with the greatest combined processing power "win" and their version of history is the official version.  That's what **mining** is.  Miners are adding processing power to the network, verifying transactions.  The only way to cheat the system and claim you have more Bitcoins than you actually do is to **destroy the system**.
Don't think of Bitcoins as separate units.  They are all part of one giant blob called the "blockchain".  It's not possible to alter the blockchain without destroying the entire blockchain.  To understand this better, watch this video:  


The only way to increase the cap is to get the majority of the miners (with their majority processing power) to agree to raise the number of Bitcoins.  But consider what would happen if the miners did this:  suddenly people would sell their Bitcoins, because they'd see the miners were being dishonest and screwing with the main code.  That would cause the value of all bitcoins to collapse, **which would make mining bitcoins worthless and pointless**.  So the miners are actually incentivized to make sure Bitcoin is an attractive currency for everyone to use!  It's like customer satisfaction.


Bitcoin is actually physical.  It's just microscopic - the blockchain is stored on hard drives, which can maintain it even in the event of a power outage or an Internet shutdown.

In 2012, it went up 3x.
In 2013, it went up 46x or so.
I think it's reasonable to predict a 20x growth for 2014, given the media and Wall Street attention, coupled with the network effect and the widespread skepticism/misunderstanding.  There is a lot of upside remaining.  **So I'll say $14,000 per Bitcoin.**

They're ignoring fundamentals.
Yes, the price of Bitcoin has gone up a lot lately.  Yes, it could correct and fall a lot.
But does that mean Bitcoin is overvalued?  Not by a long shot.  The fundamentals are still insanely good.  1 Bitcoin is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
People who roll their eyes at that statement don't understand the nature and value of the protocol to the global economy.
The holders of Bitcoin are becoming more and more aware of this fact.  They're becoming less likely to sell.  They know they have something very, very useful.  And they know a lot of other people want it.  So the price may continue to rise for quite some time, without ever correcting more than 20% at a time.

Recessions are caused by central banks expanding the money supply to create a "boom" period.  The boom is followed by a bust (recession) as the economy liquidates the malinvestments.

Right.  Bitcoin is still somewhat rudimentary, but over the next couple years more effort by professional computer programmers will be put into further streamlining the protocol and speeding it up.  We'll see the transactions per second increase drastically, and the size of the blockchain decrease (or at least grow at a much slower clip).  Hardware wallets will be released and mass manufactured, allowing even newbies to handle Bitcoins safely without fear of hacks.
We'll see institutional investors and banks looking at Bitcoin as a way to shelter their capital through the coming debt-collapse of Western democracies.  It will be an interesting time.

They may regulate the exchanges by taxing them or saying only certain people are allowed to own and use Bitcoins.  Doesn't matter, ultimately.  The network is open to anyone.  It's digital cash.
So Bitcoin will continue to change hands and grow in adoption, even with draconian regulations in place.

Here's the dirty secret about people like you:
Even if Bitcoin had a steady, slow climb from $0.03 to $4.00 over the last four years, you'd still be bitching that it was "too volatile".  Because Bitcoin (in that scenario) would be up 13300% in just 4 years.
But guess what?  Bitcoin is approaching $100 after four years, not $4.  And you're probably bitter because you didn't buy in sooner.  So what are you going to do?  You'll critique its "volatility".
Here's a clue:  nobody who holds a substantial amount of BTC cares about its volatility.  What they care about is the fact they are making money hand over fist.  And they just chuckle at people like you.

This proposal has nothing to do with a "spam flag".


No, it's not.  Spam wouldn't get through unless the sender could risk a few dollars per recipient.  There is no spam that is nearly that profitable.


No, it wouldn't be.  You'd simply open an account and type in a BTC amount for people to risk in order to contact you - 0.0003, for instance.  Then you'd be finished.


The proposal isn't for mailing lists, it's for private email addresses.  But mailing lists could easily bypass this risk wall by simply adding all the addresses to a whitelist.  Not that hard.


...I don't think you understand the proposal.  Is English not your first language?  Maybe you're misunderstanding the idea and how it works.
The money is returned to the sender when the recipient of the email tells the computer that it's not spam.


So?  The proposal isn't meant to solve every potential spam vector, only the most-common ones.


There is no "spam flag" in this proposal.

By the way, you don't need to install linux on a brand new netbook.  Just make sure your Windows computer has no viruses and disconnect from the net.  That other stuff is for if you're paranoid or you're storing tens of thousands of dollars.

Heh.  Pitiful.

And "they" want people to trust that they'll distribute the mastercoins fairly according to a pre-defined schedule.  Exodus address?  Forgive me for thinking of the Heavens Gate cult when I see that.

Actually cash is a better means to take ransom.  It's not traceable.

I'm sorry, but your assertion doesn't counter my basic points.  You appear to be using a "no true scotsman" argument here.  Hereditary monarchies are more prone to being relatively more libertarian than democracies over the longer term.

Just use a different address for each bribe.  No big deal.

Yes, but MasterCard and Visa each do 6000 transactions per second.  Bitcoin has a ways to go before it can provide the same transaction volume at lower prices.

Think of it like seeding torrents.  You're giving the middle finger to the big banks.

Every day Bitcoin makes more Anarchocapitalists and libertarians millionaires.  We own more of the currency than any statists.

It's true, and it's not an issue (yet) because there aren't that many daily users of Bitcoin.  But the block size can be increased to include many more transactions per second.
At the current pace, the blockchain will be around 5 terabytes in size after 100 years.  So size isn't a huge deal when you're talking about 60k transactions per day.  But there are ways to limit the size of the blockchain and still include all the transactions.  Programmers are working on them as we speak.  When they are implemented, Bitcoin will be much bigger than it is today.

The only reason you can't bribe your way out of prison is because there hasn't been a way to do it before - Bitcoin changes that.

21 million max.  And yes, spendability and hideability are vastly important features for a money to have.  Gold bugs have a tough time appreciating that.

Nope, Bitcoin itself was actually pretty revolutionary.

Well it's not so much the convenience of Bitcoin (because let's face it - Bitcoin isn't yet as convenient as cash for most day-to-day transactions).  It's the fact you know your savings won't be diluted through central bank expansion of credit supply.

Nobody wants to take risk.  But sometimes you have to get out of bed in the morning and leave the house if you want to get ahead in life.
