I might be too late, but...
1) Stop rounding. I want to see every last satoshi.
2) Bring back the ability for unverified users to buy notes. I understand the new policy is to curb scamming, but they are hurting the whole marketplace to get at a small portion of it.
3) Hide notes with negative balance.
4) Promote btcjam.uservoice.com/
5) Allow investments to be broken up into small notes.

Also, how about better educational tools. I think right now there is only a small overview of lending, and the faq's are only really about specific issues.  "Scams" are only mention in "Reporting Abuse" and the April blog post about phishing attacks. I think educating investors about all that lending entails (including scams, defaults, seeking compensation after a judgment award, and selling notes) could use more attention.

It's one of the lending sites I frequent. That is all.
