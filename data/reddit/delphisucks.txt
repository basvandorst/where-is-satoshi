I dreamt (2-3 days ago) bitcoin was  with price of 1500$ and then i woke up and bitcoin was at 3400$ but then I REALLY woke up. What a nightmare.
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:51:49

@_date: 2017-12-30 21:30:09
oh yes bcrash and ripple will overtake it because hm.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:37:48
As a german i have to hodl because i have to hodl 1 year to be free of taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:22:04
I admire your cause greatly, keep it up. I have to take this opportunity, well knowning nothing will come from it, but I would regret it if I did not at least post my address. Please forgive me and ignore the request. Thank you. 1BG3x4cn4k8QnfMWfdpuXFwGCP1c56DKTj
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:41:34
WHY is it that the more money you have invested, the more you think it is going to crash? Human psychology is strange.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:55:16
If bitcoin fails it will be from the inside. Like with so many things.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:36:31
sell now. that way you make a loss. but you win by buying bitcoin later again when it is MUCH MORE VALUABLE :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:34:04
also crying and i bought at 4,5k. going from 19,5k to 12,5k is not fun.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:04:51
i transferred 0.015 btc to an exchange for 22sat/byte. i need the money in about 2 weeks. hopefully that will be ok.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:06:40
not if they HEDL!
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:21:26
1 Million by end of next week
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:36:01
could it be we already hit the lowest?
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:17:00
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:10:14
yeah bitcoin will die, sure. just like that...
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:32:44
The thing is: it would not have hurt anyone to invest 10$ into bitcoin when it was worth cents. The problem is, the press was not writing about it. So nobody knew about it. So nobody bought.
What do you learn from this? The next big investment opportunity exists right know, ready to make you a millionaire. Unknown, in the dark. Find it!
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:32:56
if you sell now you must believe that it will never go up again. i think the opposite is more likely.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:51:49
everyone has a different exit value that's while btc won't crash because of THAT
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:34:49
buy high, sell low = now is the time to SELL. BUY later when it's at 20k again! /s
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:08:52
please also my 22 sat/byte fee which worked in november too if i recall correctly
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:46:27
Has anything changed? Any big event? Any MtGox event? Any gov banning bitcoin? No? Then don't worry. All cryptos are down look at 
Yes fees are fucking high but fees were always kind of an issue.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:07:53
Well in 2010 he could have just rebought the lost bitcoins because they were not that expensive.
What did it matter that he lost 8999 BTC vs. something just as expensive as that? Nothing really.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:14:57
Please dear Santa, I have been really nice this year :) 1BG3x4cn4k8QnfMWfdpuXFwGCP1c56DKTj
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:42:56
i hope it drops to 1$ then i'll buy 1000
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:26:03
100k by dec 31!!11
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:48:51
Lot's of people still need christmas presents but put all in crypto maybe?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:08:35
you can't have decentralized exchanges if youre also dealing with fiat. fiat is the entry into crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:58:37
sry only thing i know is that (by german law) hodling 1 year will result in no taxes. i found out by googling. but since i am still hodling, i cannot answer your question sry
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:38:35
i don't understand short term buying/selling. in my country you gotta pay taxes on any profit (if you hodl less than 1 year). so the drop after i sell must overcome the taxes I pay for that sell. very risky! maybe i am missing something, I don't know? don't you pay any taxes??
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:51:26
as far as i know in my country (germany), bitcoin gains are tax free if you hodl for more than 1 year. so i have to hodl anyway
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:26:21
no tax if you hold more than 1 year AFAIK.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:06:36
As someone who experienced the 5k to 3k dip, I too have learned to hodl. Best just to comfort yourself with bitcoin going to zero. Then you really don't care much what happens anymore. I'm young and I have a good job, so really, I cound take it.
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:35:44
gz. though if i were you i'd change nothing, cuz if you remove money from btc you loose any gains that btc could make in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:48:57
u mean milli (m, 1/1000) not micro (µ, 1/1000000)
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:31:59
lots of people just use btc as store of value. in that case it doesnt matter if translations take long to confirm i always use 20/sat/byte for my transactions, thats low enough.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:05:24
Why did I just click this?
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:33:07
I am so excited for you. You must be going through some serious emotions.  Some well meaning advice from me:
If something personal can be derived from your account you can bet criminals are already on your toes. You don't want that. Take measures against it if that could be the case.
It MAY be wise to delete your reddit account.
Do not connect anything to the Internet.
Backup all relevant files multiple times. Make sure even if your house burns down everything will be ok. Your goal should be to sleep well. Prepare for all eventualities. You don't fuck around with 46 Million. Never.
Read up all you can and don't rush it. As long as you have the backups and nobody else can access your data you are safe.
Safely transfer your money to a Hardware wallet or better yet multiple HW wallets from different brands. Make sure you sign any transactions offline. Read up on tails boot cd etc.
When using exchanges to sell bitcoin only deposit the amount you are willing to loose at any one time. Exchanges get hacked.
Sell some bitcoin, and think about diversifying your Portfolio. With that much money i would feel uneasy if its all in bitcoin. Also buy gold, stocks, other crypto, real estate etc! Spread risk. still keep lots oft bitcoin though. It will likely moon but nothing is certain. Anyway it will likely never go to zero so there's that. As i said you dont play games with that amount of money.
Still keep fiat money to a minimum. You never know when we get the second great depression or the dollar gets worthless.
Get a financial and legal advisor. No one shady. Vet him.  You also want professional help.
Don't waste your money. You don't ever want to work again only for the money. Lots oft lottery winners become poor again for a reason.
But also use the money for your own well beeing. You earned it. 
Think very hard about which people you tell about your new wealth.
Sleep over your important decisions. Do not decide anything on the same day. Stay focused and calm.
Last but not least think about your own health, the most important thing you have.
Best of luck to you. I hope you make it. If you like you can decide to gift me. it would certainly make a big difference in my life even a very small amount.
All the best!
