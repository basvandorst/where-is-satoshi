You do realize that didn't work, right?


What about punishing for driving drunk? Can't we just punish them for 
that since it is incredibly dangerous and irresponsible? And we can do it by doing things like taking away their license to drive, like we do currently. That way, they are not only punished for what they DID do, but they are prevented from killing someone.
Sounds pretty simple, yay!

According to this logic drunk driving isn't a crime either.

I am curious why you think this. Isnt being responsible for ones actions an important part of living in a free society?

What is it like being the money messiah? The duke of the digital dough? The dowager of the dollar? The cardinal of the cryptocurrency? Is it fun? I bet it is fun.
Also, was being doxxed by an evil journalist that is probably even less of a journalist than Adrian Chen worse, or as bad as rape?

These are some hilarious mental gymnastics for the "ITS LAL THE MEDIAS FAULT" narratives.

Its weird you would blame the media for this since it was Redditors who voted the post to the front page.
