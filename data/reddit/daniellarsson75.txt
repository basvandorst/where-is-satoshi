You are of course 100% correct in that the safest data storage method is to never expose even a fraction of your data (hash/salt or encrypted blocks) online. 
However, anyone that has the need to store, share or synchronize data across public lines should in our opinion take every possible precaution. Client side encryption is in our view the only way to ensure that at least the customer is as safe as can be, since it means we cannot decrypt the customer data even if we were threatened.

Hello. I represent Spideroak,com, and I am interested in purchasing 50 cards as soon as they be one available. We are about to do a medium-scale test in allowing customers to pay for our zero-knowledge storage service with bitcoin, making it the first 100% anonymous, secure,and 100% private storage service online.
Please send me an email at daniel and let me know your BTC address.
Also: yep. 100% aware that this is self promotion, but I feel that as a marketing manager and bitcoin enthusiast I not only can but should be a little proud that our company is joining the bitcoin world. 
Also: I intend to distribute the cards to our employees so they can learn about and use bitcoin.

I think so, but as they say: Truth is in numbers.

But you got a cool coffee cup right?

We have plans for this, we are just working out the last details. Thank you for your support.

We will be running a limited 'crypto currency' test in a few days. We are looking for a "proof of concept" and it will be manual but it's always a start.

I will digest this and bring it to attention at our next developer call in a few days. Thank you for your input!

And domain names. (Namecoin).

As I have gotten quite a few questions per pm and email, here are some answers:
YES. We are 100% private (we do not track visitors outside of basic google analytics, we do not store customer data outside of what you expressly leave) and all data stored is encrypted client-side. 
Yes, we use B-crypt in browser for generation of encryption keys, but it is 100% client side and we do not accept or store keys. 
We have never had a data-breach of client data since inception.
We report government requests for data publicly.
We are implementing a warrant canary shortly. 
We have promised, and are working towards a 100% (or very close) open source environment. And yes, we are a little embarrassed that we are not already but such is business.
We love to hear from you. We also run Crypton.io and nimbus.io that are both open source and API services that anyone can use to build their own secure and private services.

FYI: Spideroak.com (client side encrypted and 100% zero-knowledge and private) backup offer 50% off paid plans and 5GB FREE for life for world backup day!

Already happening @ 
@_date: 2013-07-24 06:29:36
I myself always schedule my wallet.dat to be backed up with our service and I feel 100% safe. 
Then again, I do work in marketing *wink* so do your own due diligence. I will say that since 2007 we have never had a client data breach and we are huge fans of zero-knowledge privacy and security to standards far above industry standards.
Oh, and we started our first alpha in 2007 so we have actually never had a single data breach.

Am I being really stupid, or does this mean that ASICMINER is mining at a FAR higher rate then people are calculating?
@_date: 2013-08-14 15:30:59
And we absolutely understand this. However, we believe that client side encryption together with the fact that we publish government data requests and have yet to ever hand over even encrypted data to a inquiring agency makes us one of the absolutely safest options for cloud-storage available.

Drop me a message and I'll give you some private and secure storage for free. BAM - bitcoin just became profitable :)
