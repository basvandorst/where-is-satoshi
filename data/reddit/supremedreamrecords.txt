My brother has an investment project in school, like which student can make the most by the end of the semester (not real money).. He asked me where to place his "hypothetical" money and i told him put a good portion into Bitcoin.. long story short his Econ Professor said hes "not allowed to invest Bitcoin because its "toxic"....
Smh.. thats coming from his Econ Prof... Unfortunately most people are still clueless about Bitcoin and still holding this negative assumption to it...
If i was still in school, id invest in Bitcoin anyways, take the "F" from disgruntled Professor, but meanwhile showing the entire class why Bitcoin's the best asset to be holding and while most likely earning gains their stocks could only imagine about.

If you use a Debit card on Coinbase it is instant... ive been using my card for about 2 years and just last month they removed it for some reason saying its not valid anymore.. i switched to my direct bank account and that takes me a few days in order to use my bought BTC.

Apparently Hal Finney was cryopreserved by the Alcor Life Extension Foundation. Random, but found that interesting.

Wouldnt say tryna bring the space together is "talking shit"? I aint here to get validation from anyone, simply expressing my gratefulness on my returns.. Whether you made 1K to 7K.. 5K to 35K.. or 10k to 70K.. i legit made a 7x gain from buying with my Bonus last December, so laugh if you want, wish you made it with me bud. I aint here to spread hate.
