I was kind of being sarcastic. 
They won’t fail. There’s no way they haven’t considered this subpoena outcome. There’s no way they don’t have the best lawyers money can buy. It’s going to be business as usual.

The market will end up working itself out. If it’s not profitable or “worth it” then nobody will do it...

Why does everyone think they’re going to fail? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:13:02
It’s healthy because it brings people back into reality and understand that THERE ARE risks to this sort of investment. 
Otherwise if it goes up non stop people are left to feel like it’s risk free or free money. Nothing healthy about that thinking.

You’re pretty much saying the long term trend of bitcoin is nothing but up. Lol? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:45:45
You aren’t a nice person. 
I can’t say I don’t like you though. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:10:59
It looks as if you’ve found the long lost passcode to the 4th dimension. 
Can you explain the steps as to how you got there so other may follow your lead.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:47:33
Omg thank you. Somebody gets it. 
Literally it’s just institutional a paying instruction b. No effect on btc 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:34:26
Naw it’s because they thought it’s prone to market manipulation. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:57:13
Well kids, not much  
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:35:56
But someone is in order to take the other side of the short. That is my point. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:05:02
But can you at least admit that it applies both ways? Your logic? You it only applies to downward pressure 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:51:53
But both sides has to post. Literally. So what’s your point? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:23:20
?? If you long withfutures it’s also levered and you also have to post collateral. For every 1 long there is 1short.for every 1 collateral there is 1 collateral on the other side.

He threw 500k at a project when it was in its infancy then went on vacation only to find out 3 years later it’s worth a fuck ton... uhh okay. 
Did he know this was coming when he made his first investment 3 years ago? No. 
Did he get thrown out of Wall Street for losing retarded amounts of money? Yes. 
While we shouldn’t take away what he has accomplished, I wouldn’t throw words like naive into the mix. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:10:00
Huh? Somebody has to take the other side of the short. For every 1 short there MUST BE a long. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:49:59
Yah I just don’t understand how everyone else is paying so much and taking so long. I really don’t think it’s that bad. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:10:30
Lol 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:25:45
Volatility is not really the determinant on these things... 
There’s like ETFs where they maximize your gains and losses by x3 or x5. THOSE swing hard. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:40:21
I’m sorry to say but The people causing FUD actually have NO CLUE about financial markets.

They could be willing to lose their life savings though. Maybe they got a cushy job 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:03:08
Okay CPA man. 
Why does gold have value? Because we give it value. 
Why does gold have more value than silver? Because we give it more value.
Why are certain sectors valued higher than others? Because we give those sectors more value. 
Why are some businesses that are identical in terms of growth, sales, and earnings valued at more than other? Because we give Them more value. 
Quantify these differences and you’ve explained human investment philosophy.
Bitcoin is valued at what it is because we give it value. Nothing more. Nothing less.
CPA man don’t overthink this. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:26:54
No. Bitcoin is not fiat.

Somebody has to take the other side of the future. Also wall street. 
It’s Wall Street vs. Wall Street.

Trust. They're flying really under the radar with absolutely 0 hype built into their current valuation.
Accumulate now though.
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:22:07
So you're holding no BTC at the moment? 
The problem is the alts you have are not that great.... a lot of them at least. 
But in my opinion you should cut your losses, redirect them into NEO, XRP, and MCO and I'm sure you'll be fine in a year. 
You need to properly assess your risk/return profile before making any investment that size..... 
Someone do a remind me because I'm calling it.
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:05:19
Aight... we’ll, that report was littered with holes
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:18:39
They do. Situations like this make approving the futures and ETFs impossible. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:48:03
No you misunderstand.
The value of stocks comes from future earning power. While there are stocks where you are paying for the assets on the balance sheet, most of the technology stocks assets would be worth nearly nothing in bankruptcy court if their core product has failed. 
It’s the promise of future earnings that drives stock price, which for most companies that perform well, will not happen within the next 10 years. Therefore they offer nothing more than a store of value in the short term. The later half of your statement is exactly what props up the stock market. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:22:21
Not really? Nearly all stocks are store of value. What’s wrong with that? They offer the promise of dividends in the future but most of the top gainers in the market have never and most likely will never pay dividends. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:51:57
Don’t sell any of it until it could actually change your life forever. Once you get used to living a certain way it becomes impossible to go back. If your wife knows she doesn’t have t work, she never will. While 1.8m is arguably life changing it won’t be life changing forever. 
If BTC does crash, worse comes to worse is you live the same life you live right now. Which is not an adjustment at all.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:46:06
I don’t see how the tether affects anything. It’s still business as usual....
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:03:41
Stocks are exactly like that too.
So is gold, silver, platinum, cobalt, copper
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:44:36
Technically he only makes money if BTC is worth more $13,000 by the end of next year. But if you factor in opportunity cost it would probably have to be worth much much much more than $13,000 for the trade to be considered worthwhile.
This trade is hand wavy but could pay off big if BTC ends up doing x3+. If bitcoin only x2 by the end of next year the trade is not really worth it.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:57:46
All appreciating value from bitcoin will come from additional buyers. What we’re talking about is why they’ll come.
Once bitcoin gets into regular exchanges and the “herd” comes, I doubt many people will actually be holding bitcoin themselves. It will be similar to the stock market where the exchanges are holding your rights to a businesses assets. All futures and ETFs only give regular people exposure.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:47:08
It’s not a big deal. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:06:10
Why can’t bitcoin just be a store of value? What is inherently wrong with that line of thinking? I’m sure if you transported gold it would also cost a lot of money.
There are so many better coins out there to act as a transaction tools.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:39:10
You can keep your BTC on an exchange but many people think it’s more easily hacked or stolen... 
It’s up to you. Storing it yourself has it’s own risks too which often aren’t mentioned.

If I'm not mistaken this doesn't change much... You just need to buy the China Coin first before you buy BTC. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:49:11
No. I'm quite sure it will be business as usual very soon. Rumor has it China just wants you to buy the China Coin first before you buy BTC or anything else. And China Coin is directly tied to your foreign transfer limit ($50k USD) so it's quite clear they were concwrned about people moving money out of China... 
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:52:49
I think it's unlikely unless exchanges really get their shit together. The last time people rushed in it literally took 2 months to get your account verified.  
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:08:46
You might be the first person I've seen who finally gets it.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:57:23
Don't know? Maybe in a week or so. If no other exchanges voluntarily shut down then I think it's very likely my theory is true and i'll buy back in then. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:55:25
Not really. This happened last time too. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:37:52
Do you actually punctuate like that ???? 
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:15:23
If they get whiped out that would be an investment loss.... 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:05:07
I honestly think that that exchange shut down because they were handling too many illegal money laundering transactions. I know that China always restricts capital outflow when it gets close to changing their government because if you aren't on the right side of the change, the government will jail you and take all your money. 
A lot of rich people were using these exchanges to move money (a lot) out of China and paying people in that exchange money to "lose" their KYC information. They use bitcoin now because it's so hard to move money out of China 
So China shut it down. It's honestly not that big of a deal.... I'm quite sure it'll be business as usual except maybe with some tighter regulations after October 15.

Yes... But the futures contract has a future price for the btc. If the contract expires their broker will execute this contract for them and purchase it for them assuming it's worth it to execute.

It didn’t say in the article who they collaborating with....  why does everyone think it’s BTC? 
@_date: 2017-09-22 07:26:05
No only currency futures are settled with cash daily and reset. Commodity futures don't behave this way. 
But in this case they mention bitcoin futures or bitcoim future etfs these are not the same thing. For regular futures you do take possession of the physical commodity unless you roll it over.
