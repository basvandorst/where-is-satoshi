I thought the charts on BitcoinWisdom looked very "slow" today. Thanks for explaining this.

Well if you need a guide - you look at Bitstamp or BTCE to work out where MtGox "should" be trading

Would you like me to come over to your house and show you how to do it?

I don't have any interest in buying a bag, but I just wanted to say that your wife is very beautiful

I'd also like to see a picture of Edith doing something with a Sharpie

thanks herrtim.  I'm probably more interested in the type of layout that  has.

Well in that case, I hope the Bitcoin auction goes well.  Because I don't want to spend my money on the Bitcoin piece of paper when I can buy the Litecoin piece of paper for about 1/30th of the price.

It's Christmas time, as a Bitcoin user without a girlfriend I REALLY wish I could figure out how to get a girlfriend.

Are you willing to sell a piece of paper with "Litecoin" written on it as well?
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:32:24
It's just like any other sell order:  you can set a limit price at which to sell, and wait and hope a buyer takes them at your price.   Or you can guarantee execution by lowering your asking price(s) to those provided by buyers. As ABoutDeSouffle said, some of those Bitcoin from that order were sold at prices closer to 730 than 695.

Thank you very much for the Gold, mystery gift-giver!  Maybe now I can show off my shiny rock and get myself a girlfriend!

You're giving far too much importance to posts on Reddit. 
Besides, in the unlikely scenario that you are correct, and if people do base their buy and sell decisions solely based on what they see on Reddit, that's their choice.

No, I don't remember how we played detective.  I don't know who you are.  I did play detective in primary school with a classmate called Aamir Patel, so unless you are Aamir, the answer remains no.

Thank you for your reply greaseburner.  I tried this site, but it's not updating automatically for me.  Maybe I'm not using it correctly, or a script is not executing as it should?

Great site senjutsuka - thank you for sharing

Market manipulation?  By posts on Reddit?  Are you serious?
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:22:38
Edith, are you a fan of Jimi Hendrix?
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:03:17
I'm not sure if you're serious or not, but if you are, maybe you could learn to disagree with people calmly and respectfully?

Someone who owns Bitcoin and who is selling them.  Also known as a seller.

Great ... now I'll have to go door-to-door in my local neighborhood, showing people a picture of a rollercoaster, superimposed with white ALLCAPS text saying "BITCOIN IS ON A ROLLERCOASTER RIDE".
