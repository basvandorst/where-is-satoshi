As Satoshi was traveling down a road, a Shaolin monk crossed paths with him. Satoshi gave a slight nod to the monk, who did not return one. Although the motives of the monk remain unknown, whether it was an insult or a misunderstanding, Satoshi tracked him down at the Shaolin Temple. He demanded from the head Abbot to kill himself as a mean of retribution, yet the Abbot refused, and Satoshi massacred all the 60 monks who resided in the temple.
