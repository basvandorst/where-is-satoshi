I just wanted to say that I had a very good experience with the kraken support and was helped to get my account back in a very short time period. They might have found irregularities but I doubt it will take several weeks. 
I wouldn't get the pitchforks out yet.

I have some BTC on my blockhain.info wallet and I have the blockchain.info app on my Android phone. But with the latest news I want to transfer all of my coins into a paper wallet and still use it to pay with my phone. Is this possible and would this be safer? Where do I start? Thanks
@_date: 2016-07-04 16:55:24
hm sorry don't know what could have happened.. I took some coins out of my wallet as well as I saw I had some left there and it went through in about an hour. Hope you get your coins
@_date: 2016-07-02 15:40:43
Go over to  and link your reddit account to the page and it should show you your balance. You can then transfer those bits to your personal wallet or tip it forward, do what you want :) have fun with it

welcome to btc
@_date: 2016-07-02 15:57:11
I don't know how long it takes, it depends on the transaction fee but you will get your coins for sure
@_date: 2013-05-22 21:01:35
Yes you're right. Well It was just an Idea, and I didn't quite thought the whole thing through i guess :)
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:32:42
I would do a lot of things for 0.01% of this wallet...
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:41:05
Exactly what I'm doing right now. Invest 10% of my income per month wich isn't much but may be worth something in a couple of years.
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:18:32
@_date: 2013-05-30 04:55:03
Ok thank you! I'll just need to be more patient then, and pay fees next time.
@_date: 2013-05-24 16:41:02
Would you still invest in ASCIminer stocks? Or am I too late to the game?
Bought 0,3BTC worth of AMC shares yesterday and just lost around 50% but I'm holding to see where it goes
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:13:32
@_date: 2013-07-30 08:10:14
Started buying around 90$ up to 200 something. When it dropped, I invested in ASICMiner and the last week I sold all AM Shares and bought into ActiveMining. 
I have almost multiplied my Bitcoins by 10 while they lost about half their value, so I'm not too sad

If I buy a giftcard for Amazon.com will it work on other amazon stores like Amazon.de?
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:30:37
I'm in for the long haul! I want to build a house with my bitcoins in about 10 years. Thats how long I want to keep most of them. The rest will be for my retirement :)
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:41:54
Actually for every dollar he gets 144,341.51869192

Here's a start
+ ALL
I hope this works, it's my first bitcointip
@_date: 2013-05-30 04:37:17
I thought Electrum is doing it automatically? I had 8.01663145 BTC in the wallet and the transaction was 8.0166...
What if I didn't pay any fees? Will my BTC be sent back?
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:15:01
I would like to use kraken but you can't in germany. Here we only have localbitcoins or bitcoin.de
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:06:49
You were right. I had to be tier 3 verified and I was only tier 2.
@_date: 2013-07-28 10:24:37
Germany is one of the most advanced nations in the world despite WWI and II...

Can't find an option to send to another virwox account. Only Secondlife and other games or servers (I have no idea, I have never played SL)
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:22:16
maybe now? :)
Edit: It worked! Sry, it's not much but in 3 years you can throw a little party with it on my name :D
@_date: 2013-05-30 08:16:37
[It has]( but I didn't knew it because I was using the [Lite UI](
And as you can see, my BTC were sent back to my wallet
Edit: Hm Electrum says that I've got my BTC back in my wallet and in the transaction history it doesn't show the transaction from yesterday but I can't make any new transaction because of insufficient funds?? ... 
Edit 2: I just had to update to the new client!
Thanks everybody for your help!

Here are a few other sites you can look at:
@_date: 2013-07-19 12:06:31
I still have some Linden dollars because I needed fast BTC last week and virwox was the only solution. Since I couldn't spend all of them you can have the rest (if there is a possibility to send Linddollars from account to account).
It's not much but maybe it can help you
@_date: 2013-05-22 20:04:23
Hm yes you're right, we would need some sort of verification.
Edit: I guess a photo with your face and a paper with reddit and username woul be enough?

Hey I made little microcontrast adjustments and cropped it for better online viewing purposes. If you don't like it I can delete it :)

And here's the answer :) I registered the fifth of november.
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:06:40
Good to know
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:48:56
Don't know, that's the email I got from them:














@_date: 2013-11-22 20:20:42
Oh sry I thought I had something because I got a tip the other day. I don't really know how this thing works, can I see my BTC balance somewhere?
But thanks for the gold!

Don't worry. Black friday wasn't even two weeks ago. I don't think anybody goes through one bottle of lotion in two weeks. I know I don't. If the customers like your product they will buy it again. A lot of people are happy being able to spend XBT for things they need.

@_date: 2013-11-19 21:36:08
yes. There is but it's quite dead
@_date: 2013-07-16 21:44:18
Thanks man, appriciated!
@_date: 2013-05-22 20:02:47
Of course the amount could be any amount, it just needs 10 people that agree on it.
