He is right in this year as well. Bitcoin is now, and will continue to be a very attractive target for theft. We will need to really innovate when it comes to security for this to be feasible for the general public.

In reference to the second point, I have heard this argument from banks as well and I am getting tired of it. The end result is I am sitting in a situation that I cannot correct because you are too afraid to tell me what is wrong. I would like to purchase bitcoins, I will send you whatever information you require, but you must first let me know what I need to do. 
When you say that you cannot tell me how to prove I am not making fraudulent transactions because of fear of teaching scammers, what I hear is you are too incompetent to find scammers in the first place.
I also have been using your service for at least a year without issue, and now I am also getting the same message. The thing that really makes me angry is this bit at the end about trying again later. I am not going to waste my time with your service on the hope that maybe you will let one through.

Coinbase takes several days to buy or sell, atm is close to instant... 30m

The difference is, one of those techniques is reversable. Bitcoin's biggest problem is it requires a better educated public then we currently have. Consider how many computers are infected with malware (Hint: it is more then half), and think about what will happen when that malware starts searching for bitcoins.

So you wouldn't be able to scam me. Is that correct? Yes I can tell if you are using cash and that is the first thing I check for.
So maybe next time you should just shut the fuck up

What rules are they not following

I sell to completely anonymous individuals daily. I may not have millions of dollars on the line, but I have an amount I find significant on the line. I have turned away deals, but I am always very clear on what is expected and if I start getting nervous about someone I explain what additional measures I need to continue working with them. The scammers are not willing to take the additional steps.
The problem isn't that they are taking measures to protect themselves, the problem is they leave zero recourse for legitimate people.

You two are ridiculous.
Yes bitcoin is a currency, and that alone is valuable. It is a trustless currency.
Yes bitcoin is also a payment processing network and thus a competitor to apple.
Both attributes are equally valuable.

The why is really irrelevant. This how things are, and these are the problems we are facing with the adoption of Bitcoin. A bitcoin bank would be solve this problem but at the cost of many of the benefits bitcoin offers. 
What is likely to happen is people will start creating wallets that require two signatures and use both their phone and their computer for any large transaction.
The scamming that usually happens requires some element of doubt of the current system. We are so used to systems that don't work that when people ask us to break a rule or two it feels very natural. We give our credit card, and ssn out so often it feels like common knowledge. This is the first time we have information that is not to be shared with anyone we don't 100% trust. People are going to get burned several times before they learn this lesson, but it will stick. Frank Abginal is right, people are going to get ripped off, but I expect it will serve as a learning lesson.

"Jersey-based hedge fund Global Advisors (GA) claims the bank was worried about "money laundering risk"."

Apple Pay is a digital payment processor hoping to solve some of the problems that bitcoin solves. Apple Pay has the potential to slow down Bitcoin.
One of the biggest benefits for merchants is the 'no charge-back' feature of bitcoin. This is a huge selling point and Apple Pay is now offering something similar.
@_date: 2014-09-05 19:01:07
Can you elaborate on this? You are saying that the merchants will not start using this technology?

Yes, because professionals would never steal your money. /s
Having experience in a field in no way makes you trustworthy. Licensing does nothing to prevent inexperienced people from entering the market, and charging people money only raises the amount they would need to steal to earn a profit.
Licensing has never been about protecting the consumer and has always been about protecting existing businesses from competition. The best way to protect people from theft is by actually going after those who steal. Unfortunatly that would mean putting the people in jail who pay our politicians 'salary'

Clients did suffer from the hack, the coins that were stolen were not refunded to the clients
@_date: 2015-01-27 02:43:18
Nope. Licensing is a way of creating a barrier to entry. Only those who can afford licenses are allowed the privilege of working a particular field. I do not see any benefit in only allowing the wealthy to control a particular market.

Sure I have no problem telling you.
I am talking about bank deposits, there is a risk of the unknown party can sometimes convince the teller to reverse the cash deposit after the fact. If I am worried about this happening then I will either make them wait until the next day to release the funds or go down to the bank and empty the account.
Please tell me how you would defeat this at little cost.

They had the same code which strongly suggests that it was the same people, albeit not necessarily all of the same people.

Again, no it won't. Having money in no way makes you competent.
The fact is not all of our restaurants are clean and safe to eat in despite our government inspection. It up to the citizen, whether he realizes this or not, to make an informed decision on where to eat. 
With money it is even more important, as everyone is attempting to scam you. You know why we still get nigerian scam emails, because they work. If someone is willing to trust their money to an incompetent exchange, then hopefully they will learn from the experience.
Remember Bitstamp just got hacked. They were one of the top exchanges. Licensing wouldn't have protected you against that.

It's not a question of whether or not it should be allowed, the problem is the government cannot prove this but is still allowed to parade it around as though it has been already proven. If the government could prove these charges, then they should add them to the list and convict him for it, since they are not doing it it is irrelevant.
