How many people actually check to ensure they're connected over SSL? I can launch a MiTM attack over SSL by replacing the correct certificate with another, less trusted certificate (or even a CA-signed certificate if I were a nation state). SSL doesn't really help in this case if the user doesn't check their certificates, or if it's someone with control over CAs performing the attack.

I think the real thing here is how much does a Trezor cost vs. how much does a Coinbase account cost; if someone can't justify spending money on a Trezor based on the amount of BTC they hold, they might as well use Coinbase because they will likely secure better than an app on their phone or laptop.

Because someone can't intercept it. Someone at an email provider (or someone running a MiTM) could see your financial details - if PGP is used, no one but the sender and the receiver can read it - and Coinbase/etc. already know your balance if they control it.

Yes. Identities are not directly linked to addresses. They can be determined using a variety of different means, but if the user is careful, it can be anonymous.

basically a website that generates a list of all of the possible keys that bitcoin can use, based on whatever page you enter. As you can see, there's a lot of pages, and there's no way you could ever actually store all of that in all of the computers in the world.

You can download the ipsw from the Itunes store on a computer, rename it to xxxxxx.zip, extract it, and change one of the values in info.plist, re-zip everything, name it back to xxxxxxxxx.ipsw, install AppSync (from angelXwind's repo, it's the only safe one), double click the xxxxxxxxxx.ipsw file to open it in iTunes, and sync it back to your device. Kinda awkward, but it works.

I have created a little *Nix script that creates a bunch of bitcoin addresses and checks  to see whether they currently have coins in them, or ahve ever been involved in a transaction (~10/s). You can find the script below. If you want, run it for a while, and then upload the resulting txt files to Dropbox/Mega and reply to this comment with a link, and I'll add it to the database.
`while :; do ./vanitygen -q 1 &gt;&gt; temp.txt; cat temp.txt | grep Priv | cut -c 10- &gt;&gt; tempPriv.txt; cat temp.txt | grep Add | cut -c 10- &gt;&gt; tempPub.txt; cat tempPub.txt &gt;&gt; ../addresses.txt; rm temp.txt; paste tempPriv.txt tempPub.txt &gt;&gt; addresses.txt; curl -s  tempPub.txt) &gt;&gt; tempResp.txt; if grep -q 0 "tempResp.txt"; then : ; else paste tempPriv.txt tempPub.txt &gt;&gt; addressesWithCoins.txt; fi; curl -s  tempPub.txt) &gt;&gt; tempRecvd.txt; if grep -q 0 "tempRecvd.txt"; then : ; else paste tempPriv.txt tempPub.txt &gt;&gt; addressesTransactions.txt; fi; rm temp*; cat addresses.txt | wc -l &gt; addressesNum.txt; cat addressesWithCoins.txt | wc -l &gt; addressesWithCoinsNum.txt; cat addressesWithTransactions.txt | wc -l &gt; addressesWithTransactionsNum.txt; done`
You'll need to be in a directory with vanitygen compiled and executable.
If you want, you can also search for your bitcoin address at  which is updated live whenever a new adderss is generated.
***PLEASE NOTE*** This might hog resources, such as CPU, memory, and internet bandwith. Use at your own risk.

Potentially, but (IIRC) P2Pool allows any transaction, including those without a fee, in their blocks, so as long as P2Pool exists, and they're getting at least 1 block in per day, you can hope to have your transaction in a block within a day.

At some point in recent history (i.e. within the last few months) someone gained access to my personal laptop, presumably through my school's WAP. They then transferred about $900 worth of applications purchased through the App Store and Adobe to their own machine, "cracked" them, and uploaded them to thepiratebay.org, under *my username*. Yes, that's right, someone created an account under my handle. All was fine and dandy for the next few weeks - I hadn't even noticed anything until some of the apps needed updating. Then the emails started flowing in, asking me for my iTunes password, attempting to crack it (which is highly unlikely due to the length). I have been put on nearly every spam and phishing list ever - luckily my spam blocker does quite a good job. For the most part, I don't really notice, except for the fact that I have to reset my Apple ID password twice per day.
So that's one way to get on these lists.

I'm sure it would be, which is why you try to get it into a package that would normally be trusted. You could also (if you have high enough permission) modify a page on, say, the Bitcoin Wiki (or make a post on BitcoinTalk) that gets someone to download anything that seems legit.

@_date: 2015-01-20 02:57:07
Why not just build on open projects like Freenet or i2p? They are exactly this, but they still require existing IP infrastructure. Rather than making all of these separate apps, build on existing services.

Anyone know if it works with what.cd?

Nethogs is exactly what I'm looking for, but it requires root (both to install and run)
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:58:31
That's what, $0.01?
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:56:32
The command in the first link doesn't work - the host has disallowed access to ifconfig. Most of the commands in the second link won't work, as they need to be installed and/or require root to run. Nethogs would be perfect, but it needs to be installed through apt-get as it has tons of dependencies. Any other suggestions?

Darkcoin's privacy features could be useful, and Namecoin's domain thingy could be useful. Some coins may not be useful on their own, but combining them with Bitcoin could have tremendous benefits.

Why? All they provide is a secure way to store coins. If they were in the business of transacting those coins, it might make sense for them to have a stance. Either way, larger blocks or not, people will be able to store coins on a Trezor.
@_date: 2016-11-08 02:11:10
@_date: 2015-08-22 21:56:08
Could you explain how it's unreliable? I'm not talking in terms of value fluctuations, I'm talking in terms actual usage. Tx/sec etc.
@_date: 2015-08-22 22:12:45
Look, I love Bitcoin as much as the next guy, but honestly there are huge problems with it (the most noticeable being the fact that it can only handle &lt;7 tx/s).
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:10:53
Also a possibility is that he is a genius, and doesn't know where the money is.

That's all true. You'd expect the sale to be for the original DB though.
@_date: 2015-07-06 22:34:34
No... Because you need way more transactions to fill up a bigger block. Read the whole thing, and if you did, you need to work on your reading comprehension skills.
@_date: 2015-07-10 23:05:46
Hm, sure. Then what is it? Why has the market been on a downtrend for months? I got a bit of info in the news, and everything this person said seems about right.

But if your computer is compromised and someone steals your coin with a much higher fee double spend, which one do you think would confirm first?
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:47:09
Um, how is it not? If blocks were bigger, more transactions would fit in a block, meaning these stress tests would require many more transactions to clog the network for the same amount of time; therefore, if they put in the same amount of money, the attack would last much less time.
@_date: 2015-07-10 22:59:59
Awesome, thanks!

How is that supposed to happen? Even at the current blocksize which allows only 7 transactions per second the block chain will continue to get bigger, it'll never shrink - bitcoin nodes aren't going to baked into everything on the planet, that's preposterous.
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:48:37
It's literally impossible to know when it's going to spike unless you can buy enough to cause a spike, but if I were to be hopeful then yes I would guess it may continue rising for a little while (it already seems to be trending back upwards for BTC/CAD, BTC/CNY, and BTC/USD, and possibly others)
@_date: 2015-03-22 12:43:55

Buy what you can afford to lose whenever you want to. There's no way to know whether next week the price will be $10k, $1k, or somewhere else, but if you can afford to lose some or all of that $1k then yes, now is as good a time as ever to invest.

And it has be proven (somewhere) that Bitcoin mining is hardly a fraction of the energy used by bank branches/offices in the US alone. Not really that significant when actually compared to something (big numbers are big, but bigger numbers make them look small).

I got in at $20, out at $40, in again at $400 (on the way down from Gox) and haven't sold yet and don't plan to until I either start losing money or desperately need to liquidate what I own (it's not a super substantial amount). I've been watching Bitcoin daily for 5 years and all I can take away is that when you try to predict what is going to happen next (either with the market, the protocol, or adoption) you're wasting your time, might as well roll some dice or ask a fortune teller.

There aren't technical limitations at all, just political ones. A bunch of people want bigger blocks, a bunch of people don't, a bunch of people want scaling solutions with the same size blocks (segwit/etc), some don't, some want both, some want neither.
