I got set up and buy my first bitcoin in under five minutes? You can literally go to to coin base set up and account link up your credit card and just confirm two random $1 dollar charges that it works and boom you can buy bitcoin....maybe a total of 5 clicks with some typing involved...? Only an extra step to get the app too and same deal with that

Yes of course, bots run rampant in the game that do all of this automatically although for the high loot drop methods of PVE as a route of gold income its chancy because some areas are PVP so those bots will get destroyed by real players and its obvious that they are bots for reasons, also using a bot is against the rules of jagex and they routinely try to find and ban these accounts from continuing to do so but still even with that said they still run rampant in areas and worlds

Yes there are plenty of items held of value to general players, the price themselves fluctuate from the in game grand exchange people essentially pumping and dumping to change prices purposefully and from general popularity and usability of the items in question, but the value per million in gold in game generally equates to roughly the same value on average with not to big of a fluctuation but the items and correct farming methods is what would bring you the said gold to sell, for reference I believe a membership bond which nowadays can be used to buy membership for the game with in game gold making buying gold to stay a member especially from illegal sellers much more desirable where in the past you could only buy membership with real money
Edit: forgot to mention the value of the bond which I believe is somewhere around 3.6 million gold for the old school runescape and essentially the up to date runescape usually being 10x that amount roughly. If you buy the gold from jagex themselves which again this wasn’t do able in the past which makes buying gold even more desirable to some, one bond is about 5 dollars. High level players can, with consistent gameplay bring in over 20 million a day in game gold depending on your farming methods or luck from high value item drops from PVE but that’s high level players and even then would require a minimum of 5+ hours of gameplay if you are familiar with the methods. So no I don’t believe there are hundreds of players actually farming this hardcore every day usually its people maxing out there character for actual personal pleasure rather than to illegally sell the gold online
