I understand the excitement. But we see this all the time. Right now it is in a “lower high” pattern. Until it consistently keeps making “higher lows” and being stable we can’t consider this anything then a dead cat bounce.

Privacy should be a concern, but soemtimes you gotta take a small hit to get your hands on some btc, then transfer to other wallet
@_date: 2019-07-24 19:36:42
OMG �� ARE THE BEARS BACK?!?!? Will the bulls take control?!?!?? I hope some knowledgeable youtubers make some videos so I know what to do!!!

Fuck ...and I was upset when I sent $30 worth to the wrong address

Similar is in an idea that is out of the box... not another type of coin or currency

I think bitcoin is the definition of America. It’s a free thinking idea that someone created. Banning bitcoin would be anti-American.

The tribes in the Amazon
@_date: 2019-07-30 03:19:26
Yes you’re right, I mainly said that because it’s a bitcoin subreddit, so I was trying to tie my discussion topic into btc somehow
@_date: 2019-07-29 04:26:15

@_date: 2019-07-30 02:58:17
Thank you! Good idea
@_date: 2019-07-30 19:37:37
Some btc atms don’t require an ID, but if you are being good and not naughty the ID part shouldn’t be that much of a concern ;)
@_date: 2019-07-24 19:39:02
I thought libra was supposed to be a “stable coin” .

Maybe bull trap a better term to use
@_date: 2019-07-19 03:26:08
Yes one day, but today? no. Let’s hold 10k before we keep talking about 100k
@_date: 2019-07-30 02:44:44
Also in no way shape or form is this post disregarding the greatness of btc... i own btc and I think it’s amazing...I’m just trying to hear of some other investment ideas people have come across. And this is the best community to ask because 99% of us are all open minded thinkers since we have an interest in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:20:16
I’m not saying it’s unrealistic, I believe btc will get there. But what’s unrealistic is people saying it’s gonna happen in 2 weeks.
@_date: 2019-07-31 03:51:28
Yes they also could be down talking it right now because they want to control it so the actual citizens don’t own the majority.
@_date: 2019-07-03 03:09:40
I’m thinking right ass cheek
@_date: 2019-07-29 04:26:45
Oh fawkkkkkkkkkkkkk will the bulls take control ?!?!?!??!!????

@_date: 2019-07-18 20:36:51
Okay this is actually getting ridiculous now.... let’s hold over 10k for  couple weeks straight first lol
@_date: 2019-07-18 01:57:35
Someone stop this madness

@_date: 2019-07-18 20:38:53

@_date: 2019-08-14 18:13:22
@_date: 2019-08-04 23:59:19
But they guarantee the time of arrival. What changes to make the btc send faster?
@_date: 2019-08-31 22:28:39
Oh yeah I totally agree, I just need to set a goal I can afford to buy once a week.
@_date: 2019-08-22 13:01:59

I’m sure we will see an article in a few days titled “possible Silk Road drug dealer moves over 8k bitcoin”
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:30:18
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:24:47
Only the bitcoin gods know that my friend ;)
@_date: 2019-08-31 22:25:09
Yeah I’m  19 and used to have about 18K in bitcoin, I got nailed with some financial difficulties and had to use the money for living. Literally can’t wait to start buying more again, sucks I’m starting from nothing.
