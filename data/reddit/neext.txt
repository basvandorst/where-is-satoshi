Very good advice and I'm glad you took it.


 said this and this is exactly right.  People are reading into everything you say and nuances of language, tiredness of brain, perhaps even ESL complexities are turning what you intend to be good-willed communication - into a tinderbox.
Your answer to any questions about withdrawals and losses, in USD, BTC, ALTs, or otherwise should simply be "that will be announced soon".  Right now you are either being careless in your responses in an effort to satisfy the masses - or you are making assumptions that may or may not be true.

Zane.  It says that I cannot withdraw, transfer, or trade due to my "Bitgo wallet being frozen".  Can you please advise what this means, or how I unfreeze it?  To my knowledge I did not initiate a freeze on it, nor do I understand how that should matter anyway.  My reported balance your website is accurate according to my own personal records.

I'm absolutely blown away that there is always some people living under rocks that expect every user to hold their bitcoin on a private wallet.
Bitcoin wouldn't be worth jack shit if it wasn't for people like me who traded it.

This is not true.  Assuming they are considered cap gains anyway, which until the irs announces rules for cryptos, they should be.

Companies that have a huge stake in the future of btc could easily decide it is in their best financial interests to do exactly this. Saving gox and all those btc will help legitimize the industry and be a huge boon for the price. 
Would you give up a portion of your btc now if it would make its adoption and appreciation quicker?  That's their bet in tldr terms.

Omg.  I said the same thing after the bubble that Wired wrote about. Then again after the one last spring.   When I heard it had hit $1k I kicked the shit out of myself and decided I'd rather lose my entire investment than make the same mistake a third time. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:17:23
While I don't disagree, I think you're underestimating the value of being first.  Btc will be the way most people are introduced to crypto. 
However, I absolutely believe that there is room for many successful cryptos in a future economy.  I also believe that if crypto as a whole succeeds, btc will be one of the success stories.

The nice thing about alts is they are tied to btc... so if you lose 10% on the alt, but btc goes up 25%.. you still win.  I wouldn't/don't day trade btc to fiat though.  Too risky.
EDIT:  And before someone says but you would have made more money in my example if you would have just stayed in btc, well yes, duh.  The point I'm trying to make is that day trading alts allows you to gamble (which its really not, but that's another post entirely) while still getting the benefit of being in the btc market.  
In addition, many alts had a big increase relative to btc during this last bubble so if your in alts and a bubble hits, you could make 50% or more btc's, which themselves are worth more USD's.  Win win.  I love alts.  I started with .5 seed like I said, and maybe I've been getting lucky, but I'm turning that into 10 btc or going bust.

Total newb here but trying to learn.  Questions :

Been buying slowly for 2 months and I'm up to a fair number of coins now with a basis of around 650.  If it goes to 450 I want to buy another dozen but I think my wife (who has been very understanding to this point) will throw a fit.  Hell, she's probably right to.  I'm only investing about 5 percent of our retirement savings, but I guess that's a lot for such a risky investment. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:35:30
You can also offset your gains with them.  So if you had 10k cap gains, you can use 13k of losses. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:09:56
I write code for a living and I've never considered myself particularly good at it.  I guess I'm a fucking Rockstar in comparison to Gox because I would *never* connect a "cold" wallet to a hot wallet and not have any report generation or audit processes on it. 
The ineptness boggles the mind.

Bank of America tried to do exactly this several years ago (before finally canceling the idea amidst a tide of bad press).  I told them to go suck a dick and moved all my business to local credit union. 
There are some drawbacks (free atm locales) but overall all I'm much happier.

The vast.. VAST majority, I completely agree.  
But as you well know, there are some potential David's out there well positioned to take down (or at the very least compete with) Goliath.  Especially if the problems with PoS can be resolved.

Based on current laws defining financial instruments, btc behaves far more like an asset than a currency.  I'll never understand why so many don't get that the IRS had no choice.

Do you work for Bofa?  lol I already explained why I left them.  Their threat to charge me $5 bucks a month for the convenience of paying businesses with a debit card.  I had three checking accounts ($15 a month) with them not to mention savings accounts and credit card.  All got moved because of that bullshit.
It reminds me of the ticketmaster convenience fees.  You know, when they charge you some outrageous fucking amount to buy the tickets off the internet.  Like that doesn't save them a shitload of money too. Would BofA prefer I write a check?  No, its all about "we are doing this because we are a greedy corporation and can".  I told them to fuck off and moved all my business. 
As I said, I like Golden One just fine.  I get a free account with no minimum balances and solid customer support.  I can deposit a check with my phone.  I get no fees now, one free overdraft from savings a month (ask BofA to do that for you) and their website and bill pay is every bit as good as BofA's.  
Happy I made the move - and it was a TON of work to do.  So many automated payments and charges.

@_date: 2014-02-26 16:42:24
Nothing has taught me more about the Bitcoin world than the comments in I read it religiously. 
Oh.  And best way to learn about the technology is to buy some.   Even 5 bucks worth.   Send it around to some exchanges and watch it move through blockchain.info,  put it on a paper wallet,  take it off a paper wallet,  try some desktop clients like Armory.  You'll learn much faster since the knowledge won't be abstract.

She obviously felt comfortable with her level of research and probably felt like she was about to become a rockstar from the story.  Instead, she's getting death threats.  We all make mistakes, and there certainly was a ton of circumstantial evidence here.   Not to mention Dorians own admittance of saying he's no longer "involved in Bitcoin"

The butter in question clearly doesn't know jack squat about eth and even admits it in his post.


Not only does he admit he doesn't know shit about the subject he is participating in, the very next thing he says is "and they aren't important"
I said he was shortsighted, but even though you keep putting your words in my mouth, in this case you are right.  He does have small minded vision.  Thanks for correcting me.  
You clearly don't understand the point and this is the last time I'll try.  I'm not a hypocrite because i never said a word about him not liking eth.  My comments have always been around his (and your) fanaticism for bitcoin above all else.  It's disgusting.
Good day.

Why did you think Bitcoin is anonymous?  The only way it works is because you can trace each coin back to the block where it was created.

I think Etherium is a huge ripoff. But at least they are ostensibly trying to better crypto.  And they will succeed in that attempt too, either by bettering it or by showing what doesn't work.  But either way, this is something you buttcoiners will never understand - cuz if it's not Bitcoin, it by default sucks.

"everyone who isn't praising etherium" 
Where did I say anything about eth in my first post?  It was a general statement about his shortsighted cultism. 
It is poor reading comprehension, straw man arguments, and the general douchebaggery of the butters in here that reminds me why I rarely venture into this sub.
