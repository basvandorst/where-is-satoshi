But they pay the fees so who cares.
@_date: 2015-12-05 19:25:48
How do you get this? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:48:37
Thanks for the update, glad we have people like you on here.
@_date: 2014-01-05 06:50:44
Every single time. Please use 2 factor people. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:09:16
The fees are way lower too. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 01:29:47
Gemini, took me a day to get confirmed, and the fees are one tenth.

Yes, just look up how to transfer bitcoin. Make sure you type in the right receiving address. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:39:49
No worries it is a complicated subject! The ledger is great, trezor is as well. As mentioned in the post make sure your getting it from the actual retailer not a reseller.
You are correct about the process, make sure you have the right address when you send bitcoin, but you got it!

I wouldn't trust leaving your coins on any exchange, you don't own the private keys there. Small amounts are fine if your okay with losing them, but the amounts your talking about you should just buy a hardware wallet to completely secure your funds. Look up what happened at Mt. Gox for proof as why to not store at exchanges.

I guess I'm out of the loop, how would 2X have frozen? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:23:29
Remember when everyone said to get your coins off of exchanges prior to the fork? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:21:23
Yeah exactly, I'd practice with a very small amount back and forth to get comfortable with the transactions before you send a bunch. As far as selling you could sell as much as you want and be safe as long as you reaaaallllyy make sure it's going to the right address. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:20:24
What's the average transaction fee for sending 1 Btc nowadays? I've been holding forever and haven't had to send anything lately. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 04:07:43
Is a segwit transaction segwit to segwit. Or just one of the addresses?
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:54:55
Fees are lower on the weekends due to less volume. We get these posts every weekend it seems like.

I've never tried this so correct me if I'm wrong. But don't you need some sort of program on the device to do this. Which you download from the internet onto another device I'm sure and then put it on the air gapped device? So isn't that the weakest point? 
@_date: 2017-09-26 04:32:13
Not true, you still have to scan your private key or enter it online somehow. With a hardware wallet it never touches the internet. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:33:56
It does, but there is so much money sitting on the side for people waiting for the price to go down it might not be as severe in the past. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:56:28
Withdraw bitcoin to new segwit wallet. Then move BCC to another wallet and do with it what you please. It's important to move the bitcoin first iirc because it may expose your private keys if you move BCC first. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:14:56
Don't feel dumb it's a complicated subject, I do not think they have implemented segwit yet. You can tell because the address will start with a 3. You do not have to move your bitcoin to a segwit address for this to work, I was just trying to help adoption.

What's driving this? Just speculation? 
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:46:17
That's why I acknowledged using the Gox price. I personally don't use them but they still clear the most BTC per day out of any of the exchanges so I think most people will react when their price goes over 200.
@_date: 2013-09-05 16:45:46
How this subreddit has been lately...
OMG GUYS PRICE IS GOING UP ITS GOING TO BE ANOTHER BUBBLE!
OMG GUYS PRICE IS GOING DOWN WHAT SHOULD I DO?!
chill the fuck out.
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:08:24
So all we need is two more days of &gt;.3 velocity. So we are 1/3 of the way to a crash if that were to happen. Also worth noting that after each day of &gt;.3 velocity the price dropped later, so I hate to be the one to point this out but the price will most likely go down soon if we are going by the same analysis.

Just accept MoneyPak instead of paypal.

If you are a miner then yeah litecoins would be better. But BTC is more developed and has a much better chance at hitting it big than litecoins.
@_date: 2013-10-25 15:11:30
Just use a different exchange or sell on local bitcoins. If you don't like how their operation is working don't use it, pretty easy.
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:37:40
Just wait for the mining being profitable again posts. 
@_date: 2013-09-06 20:11:49
Were your purchases of BTC instantly available?

So lets say I own a large pool, and I need to make some coin, I can just bet under the hashrate and then turn off all my miners (say 20% of the network) and boom, I ripped all the other people off. 
@_date: 2013-09-01 17:56:12
Have you ever used the new gmail Google wallet feature through loaclbitcoins.com to send/receive money?
@_date: 2013-09-16 13:56:29
I'll give you 2BTC for your car, thats pretty easy for both of us!
@_date: 2013-08-31 04:34:54
This is by far the best comment I have ever seen, if I believed in Reddit gold I would gift it to you.
@_date: 2013-09-06 20:15:02
Why should you move it 100 times? Just create more work for miners?
@_date: 2013-10-21 15:13:19
Why do the Chinese like Bitcoins so much lately?
