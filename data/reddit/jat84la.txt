i would not trust btc-e with usd.  have never sent in usd,  or taken out usd.   but they do support crypto. I use btce to trade to ltc,  and pretty well any other coin.  
we need to have coinbase / mtgox to support ltc.

Over the next few weeks it will rise. Remember on Nov 18 there is a lot of people that have just discovered bitcoin.
Currently coinbase is 1 of the easiest ways to get started. With the process of creating a new account.
People that just want to get into bitcoin may have to wait Nov 25 to Nov 27 to make their first purchase.

it depends on what coinbase says.
If they are sold out,  normally they let you reserve a spot to buy when coins are in stock.  meaning the market price you pay will be different.
When you are a new user, they also make you wait to receive your first coins.  In that case they will provide you a quoted price. charge you.  then you receive the coins after the waiting period.  like waiting for a check to clear.
