I didn't say that. my reasoning was that since there will always be demand for bitcoin or will be for at least the considerable future due to the silkroad that any statements about it being a bubble rather then a market correction and the previous upshot a rally are absurd. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:08:41
because it obviously due for a short term correction? Everyone is always looking for proof I'm full of it. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:48:39
I don't hang out much. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:50:29
Plus I don't have A smartphone it's my familly. We POORRR!!! Poor poor people.
I'm thinking the Phone line. Stupid me.

 i'm not saying bitcoin  is waterfalling or business insider is being fair but...
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:37:36
what idiot bought at 900?
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:26:50
looking at the charts it looks like honestly speaking bitcoin just decentralized a CONSIDERABLE amount
noticing the huge selloffs, people selling 8000 coin blocks, 300 coin blocks….
and the buys are mostly tiny. I think people who had a LOT stored decided it was time to cash out. They’re beginning to be replace

he's dead, jim.
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:39:34
Dude i'm LONG on bitcoin. like. 10 years Long. All the speculators. ugh.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:52:38
we need to decentralize exchanges. Why is everyone and their brother still using gox anyways?
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:48:32
i'm not completely sure what they would do. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:46:58
I know right! winklevoss...
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:43:01
how does one  Define a bubble? do bubbles crash and then rally? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:17:28
not really angry, just making a point about the flippant panic. Hell, it's a buy signal for me
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:42:19
yeah, and? Red herring.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:46:40
bingo! we have a winner!
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:12:11
which is stupid given that there are markets you can buy shit you’d want with bitcoin on.
that beat newegg
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:51:16
What is there that isn't a guarantee of future demand if the silkroads  defiance isn't? People want their "no risk of getting shot" drugs. it's not just a narrow band of geeks and drug addicts. I mean it is, but they're going to keep wanting that stuff.
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:26:52
YAY PEople abandoning MtGox! more! MORE PEOPLE GO! Decentralize!
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:42:21
isn't all of this completely ignoring that the regulations would be impossible to enforce? Not even with extremely draconian measures.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:34:13
it's like paypal but there's no government, bank or corporation involved. it allows people to send money person t person over the internet and the only middle man is a computer running the bitcoin software.  Great way to STICK it to the man.  You can trade it with a little Barcode on your smart phone.
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:56:12
fair point. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:51:55
makes black market safer = guaranteed demand. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:55:20
have a better one?
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:44:27
the regulation would be impossible to enforce. anyone who thinks they could needs to research more.
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:44:53
 idiocy rules the speculator. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:32:33
and yeah maybe by your logic it is overbought but the point is bitcoin is not going to "Die" a real bubble pops and doesn't recover for a LONG time. We just "popped" in may. and people are driving the panic speculation YET AGAIN. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:07:23
I know. People are still screaming BUBBLE! BUBBLE ! BUBBLE!  SAVE MY PONZI SCHEMES in OTHER things! 
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:49:15
I plan to. i'm just pointing out that people seem to have a lot of misconceptions about bitcoin. Like "a narrow band of geeks are the only one's interested" the silkroad pretty much solved violent drug crime.  all of hell and half of europe wants pot legalized here in the us. Do people really think there won't be demand for them because of the silkroad and other services?
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:43:19
you are confused: regulation of any degree no matter how draconian is impossible to enforce.
