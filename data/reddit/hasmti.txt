It sounds like pretty much everything else.
You can buy gold from some of the few people who already have some or you could mine it - but that's going to be hard.
Should everybody send all their bitcoins to a central address so that everyone can get their fair share?
If you want to compare it to Monopoly, I don't think anybody feels like starting over everytime somebody new wants to be dealt in, same for gold, same for stocks, same for land, same for everything.

there are 144 blocks a day, 6 * 24.

Admitting when wrong about something?
Have a thumbs up @_date: 2014-08-25 14:06:03
I think the only way this would be possible is if the person who sent you the btc was also the attacker, and even then the time frame is limited.
Miners cant just make transactions up - they still need the private key of the btc they are spending.

Nothing about that sounds unfair to me at all.
It is exactly the same as buying gold off somebody who bought it pre 2001, the same as somebody buying apple stock from somebody that bought their's before the ipod.
Why should I pay millions for New York real estate when somebody paid a few beads for it in the past?
Of course nobody has to buy into bitcoin, you say you have something that is 1000 times more useful but I am unaware of anything that is as useful as bitcoin, for the things bitcoin is useful for.  Perhaps you don't understand the utlity?

How am I depending on miners to keep my bitcoins at their current address?
Miners will always mine.  If they won't, then users will mine.

how exactly would the bitcoins in cold storage not be secure?
@_date: 2014-08-25 13:17:30
no, bitcoin is useless without electricity, but so is google, so are trains and cars (well if you are talking about an emp) all bank accounts, stocks, etf's, pretty much everything but gold water and food.  
And in this situation, would the gold even be useful? Are you going to buy a horse? I don't think we have as many horses now as we did before electricity.  How are all the people in all the cities going to get food?
If you had enough gold maybe you could use it as a weapon, but I highly doubt that in this situation you'd be bragging to all the bitcoiners about your gold stash.

they challenged and won in Canada.

I never even heard of such a service like this till I read about them taking bitcoins a week ago.  It's a pretty good service they offer and of course bitpay's integration is flawless.

but where is the unfairness?
@_date: 2014-08-25 14:19:05
how many vegetable could you grow in downtown LA in  this apocalyptic situation? Where will the water come from? You don't think people would take some when it's almost ready to eat? People with guns? People who find it easier to shoot a gun than weed a garden?
What if you saw this scenario coming and stocked up on canned goods and no weapons? six months in when somebody sees how healthy and well fed you look, don't you think they would go to desperate measures?

50 btc is enough to justify getting a trezor which is probably the best combination of ease and safety.
@_date: 2014-09-05 17:53:46
I got $100 USD of btc.  2.9 % cc fee made 102.90 USD.  Bank's exchange rate made it 115.44 CAD.
@_date: 2014-08-30 22:42:51
trezor colours and materials have really shown me how much people care about so little.
@_date: 2014-08-25 12:27:18
what does this matter? If somebody buys a bitcoin at $100 and sells at $500 how is he better off than somebody who bought at $500 in hopes to sell at $2500.
When the person bought at $100 there was certainly no guarantee they would go to $500, just as now there is no promise it will go to $2500.
Do people avoid buying gold because so few people had such a huge head start? Gold was around $200 in 2001. Of course at the time I remember thinking I missed the boat on gold.
I don't know what percentage of gold has been mined, but of the gold that has been mined about half is the product of slavery.  So every time somebody buys gold they are directly supporting slavery, all gold is worth a little more because of the demand.
Personally, I would rather give my money to an early bitcoin adopter who saw the value of bitcoin early on and managed to hold on to them and believe in them as long as they have, rather than the descendants of some old slave masters.

it seems unlikely that everyone would stop mining at once, but if it happens maybe we'll fork it to make the difficulty adjust more often.
@_date: 2014-08-25 13:03:36
It's a pretty unrealistic scenario though. There will always be people ready to fill the mining void, even if bitcoins were worth pennies and we went back to cpu mining, mining will not stop.

I think carbon credits are a scam.
Pay somebody $100 to plant a tree, they plant it at a cost of $1 and burn a liter of fuel for every 25 trees planted.

even easier, a deck of cards - just type in ah,kd,2c...
You can even save the deck as a backup.  Though I'm not sure if this was really the question being asked.
