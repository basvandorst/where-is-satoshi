You promised to write in details the necessary components for the chain of blocks to be considered Blockchain ( cryptography research, algorithms used etc.) for Reddit users not to consider Blockchain tech a magic - that seems to be the initial trolling intent

The folks on Reddit are not to be sold anything, they are just too smart. Please enlighten my dark eyes what is Blockchain technology then( what are the necessary features in order to be considered Blockchain) and how centralized databases would help to legalize cannabis, in details, if you can.

So just trolling, then. Free of charge or a paid troll?

Thanks for your comment. Even if you are correct, it is only a matter of time and research. The article is general, technical details to follow. Consensus algorithm ( which will include proof of work to some extent) will make the tech quicker and more efficient than centralized databases. Do I smell centralized databases supporter here? Or just a troll trying to downvote my post for some reason whatsoever? Please upvote my post if you think that blockchain can help legalize the weed!!!
