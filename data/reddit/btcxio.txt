I'm not making excuses for them, but trying to help put things into perspective. Looking at the news, they announced the funding 12 months ago. These things take time. It doesn't happen overnight. 
They have to first even get the funding, and it maybe contingent on various things, who knows. They may have had to come up with detailed development plans, road maps, and so on to get funding. Then begin work, which means recruiting, hiring, training, *then* development. Then testing, testing, and more dev. Maybe they will come out with something soon?

If you're in the US, try Coinbase or Circle, both reputable companies to buy with credit cards. If you're not in the US, you should say what country so people can assist you better. :)

* setup account on circle and buy bitcoins on circle
* then send bitcoin to your personal bitcoin wallet (you said blockchain.info in your case)
* transaction can take just a few mins and maybe up to an hour for a few confirmations

Whatever provider you go with, you should still be using PGP to encrypt your emails for sensitive information.
