Yeah I suppose your right, I guess if you spend more than an output, it creates multiple inputs that reference other outputs you received until all of the money has been spent.

This probably wouldn’t just target cryptocurrency but fair enough.

My question is not mentioned in the Bitcoin white paper, I have read the white paper several times over already...

In the past 30 years, gold has only tripled in value. If you bought $500 (1 OZ) of gold in 1990 and sold it today it would only be worth upwards to $1,500; however if you put $500 in mutual funds in 1990 for 30 years it would have been worth $5,000 today which is 10 times the initial investment (at an annual return of 8%). Might be a better idea to take that few thousand in gold you have there and throw it into mutual funds. Just my two cents. :D

I never said i uncovered some great secret, it was merely something i noticed that could POSSIBLY be related. I was not trying to cause an argument, just wanted someone else's opinion on my idea. Thanks for your input and the information.

Sure, certainly a valid point.
