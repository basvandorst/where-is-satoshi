Everyone here wants to hear that they are smart investors and that no matter how high you buy in, you will make money, and there is no risk because btc is the money if the future. But that’s no different than what every other commodity holder believes. Btc is great, btc is progressive. Btc can however still fail, and people should know that no amount of confirmation bias is going to get their money back if they are wrong, or overextended into crypto. Tread carefully, even/especially with “sure things”.

So every law has a letter and spirit, following just the letter and ignoring the spirit of the law is just as illegal as following the spirit of the law while technically breaking it.
