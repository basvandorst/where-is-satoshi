what is it used for? I know its been used with computers and cell phones but they have only been around for 30 years. 
Gold was money since the 1200s. It is very malleable. But at the same time silver and cooper was very easy to make into coins. So why did they choose gold? because its rare. Bitcoin is very rare. Gold wasn't suitable for trading because it was too cumbersome so they switched to gold backed notes. Then with government deficit spending they had to get off of the gold standard because they couldn't afford it.

I feel like 90% of the ICOs are just shitcoins. What I do to know a shitcoin is ask questions like "what purpose does it serve?" and "why does it need to be a coin?" I see so many shitcoins on binance that I read their whitepapers and I don't see why they have to have a token/coin at all. Its something that could just be a normal business.

How hard could it be they have a bug in the system or whatever.

A metal is deemed to be precious if it is rare. The discovery of new sources of ore or improvements in mining or refining processes may cause the value of a precious metal to diminish. The status of a "precious" metal can also be determined by high demand or market value. Precious metals in bulk form are known as bullion and are traded on commodity markets. Bullion metals may be cast into ingots or minted into coins. The defining attribute of bullion is that it is valued by its mass and purity rather than by a face value as money.
Gold and silver, and sometimes other precious metals, are often seen as hedges against both inflation and economic downturn. Silver coins have become popular with collectors due to their relative affordability, and, unlike most gold and platinum issues which are valued based upon the markets, silver issues are more often valued as collectibles, far higher than their actual bullion value.
An initially precious metal that became common is aluminium. While aluminium is the third most abundant element and most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, it was at first found to be exceedingly difficult to extract the metal from its various non-metallic ores. The great expense of refining the metal made the small available quantity of pure aluminium more valuable than gold.[6] Bars of aluminium were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle of 1855,[7] and Napoleon III's most important guests were given aluminium cutlery, while those less worthy dined with mere silver.[6] In 1884, the pyramidal capstone of the Washington Monument was cast of 100 ounces of pure aluminium. By that time, aluminium was as expensive as silver.[8] The statue of Anteros atop the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain (1885–1893) in London's Piccadilly Circus is also of cast aluminium. Over time, however, the price of the metal has dropped. The dawn of commercial electric generation in 1882 and the invention of the Hall–Héroult process in 1886 caused the price of aluminium to drop substantially over a short period of time.
In the last nine months of 1979, the brothers were estimated to be holding over 100 million troy ounces of silver and several large silver futures contracts.[26] However, a combination of changed trading rules on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the intervention of the Federal Reserve put an end to both their holdings and their potential for profit on the commodity. By 1982, the London Silver Fix had collapsed by 90% to $4.90 per troy ounce.[27]
In 1979, the price for silver jumped from about $6 per troy ounce to a record high of $49.45 per troy ounce (on January 18, 1980),[28] which represents an increase of 724%. The brothers were estimated to hold one third of the entire world supply of privately held silver (not counting the silver held by governments). The situation for other prospective buyers of silver who had not stocked up on the metal in advance of its bull run was so dire that the jeweler Tiffany's took out a full page ad in The New York Times, blaming the Hunt Brothers for the increase in price and stating that "We think it is unconscionable for anyone to hoard several billion, yes billion, dollars' worth of silver and thus drive the price up so high that others must pay artificially high prices for articles made of silver".

I might have to buy some more while its still cheap. Iota still is a great idea/project. I'm just pissy over their leadership handling of business lately. From the "teaming up" with microsoft that was portrayed as a partnership but not EXACTLY said to be a partnership even though news media said that and Iota leadership failed to correct them until mircrosoft corrected it. Iota's CEO talking about how he just got off the phone with 26 "big" companies. Multiple stretching the truth on dates the wallet would be fixed. Implying it would fixed soon when they knew perfectly well it wouldn't be. I got feed up with them all and sold out. Thats not how you do business. Maybe it will take off but I just couldn't stand the half truths and having to read between the lines. They don't lie but they don't tell the truth. Trust is big for me so I couldn't deal with them anymore. Great product I hope the CEO gets his shit straight and stops acting like a 17 year old girl on twitter. 
XRP is really interesting to me, I definitely see huge profits if its added to coinbase which is why I originally bought it.

Well the bitcoin supply is limited so Feds can't control it. There's no central bank to infuse money during an economic down turn. So yeah if everyone turned to bitcoin it could be very bad for society. 
Governments couldn't run deficits and they would go under. Our whole system is built on this. And I don't think we can ever go back without a huge depression.

When I first invested 90% BTC 10% LTC (that was 3 years ago) 3 months ago it was 50/50 now its almost 10% BTC and 90% LTC. Though I sold some LTC for ALTs. REQ is a great investment IMO. Ripple I bought in for the coinbase hype like right away I dropped a couple thousand on it and it doubled like the same day. Sold Half so its free money at this point. I don't know a ton about ripple just bought it for the coinbase fake news and it worked out. Request Network on the other hand has very very high potential. I don't really invest in coins I don't believe in( I believed in iota until it exploded in price and imploded in leadership so I dumped it). I understand the business model and its genius. It needs to get adopted but its really gonna take off IMO. It could be the next bitcoin. Basically, transactions burns coins so the more its used the smaller the supply gets fees and burn rates get adjusted like the mining difficulties in BTC. Just instead of being rewarded less they burn less as it is used and price goes up. Its not really a crypto like BTC or LTC, its more like owning stock in paypal. REQ tokens are used to transfer actual crypto from one person to another. This creates a blockchain for accounting purposes that is immutable. The business side of it has tons of potential that I feel like the nerd world doesn't understand. Just a tip if anyone wants in on the action because its currently pretty cheap. Obviously, its not a sure thing but if it can do everything they are trying to do and get adopted(the harder part), the value of it will be very hard to predict which could mean moon. Or a modest profit. Who knows, its very exciting

Bro, I mean this from the bottom of my heart. You need to diversify away from BTC, Im not saying sell it all but get into stocks and other things. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:01:14
they need have to buy bitcoin or our system is going to get fucked. Now Im pro bitcoin because I own it. The problem with the future of everyone owning bitcoins and using them as currency instead of dollars, is the FEDs lose control over money supply. Which is very important because during a recession the FEDs print money like crazy which increases money supply which devalues people mortgages, car payments, rent.... etc. Long term fixed payments a cheaper meaning they have more money to buy shit with which saves us from a depression. (This is what happened in 08). There are pros to hyperinflation. If everyone were to turn to bitcoins it could end up like 1920s and 30s again. The governments(mainly Britain and sterling) after WW1 were desperate to get back on the gold standard and go back to pre-war parity. So they had to decrease money supplies which in turn appreciated their currency back to the levels for their currency. Now appreciation sounds good now the pound sterling I have is worth more so thats good. But by decreasing the money supply to get back to pre-war parity, the liquidity dried up. Meanwhile france was doing the opposite. They had a weak currency and everyone was trading their pounds in for gold and taking it france to trade it for the franc. So the british were running out of gold reserves forcing them to keep their money supply lower and lower. Eventually, this caused very high tariffs between countries that were running a surplus(france) and deficits(britain). 
So in an economic downturn, people holding bitcoin is exactly what you don't want to do. Because yes it will go up in value but the economic downturn ends up feeding itself. Hold and it becomes more valuable so you don't spend any money in the economy so the economy suffers and you take all you're spare money and hold it because its going up because the economy is going down. Over and over again into a great depression. In 2008, they devalued the dollar so much by printing a ton of surplus that it didn't make sense to hold it and you would be better off spending. 
Thats why the government and you should be very concerned about bitcoin actually taking over as currency. The gold standard's pros are stability and limited government. But the cons are limited government intervention in a bad economy. Once a market becomes self fulfilling its really hard to get out of it. 
Just look at the performance of gold in good economic times(90s) and bad(2008).

Bitcoin kinda reminds me of gold. Im sure back in the 1840s when guys were getting gold off the river floor, you could pay for a beer with gold.

You guys think its like 3 people. Its not! Its the banks and credit card companies. Bitcoin threatens them. Why have a bank when you can have bitcoin wallet and not pay ATM fees and shit.
Here the first article that comes up when I google bitcoin. Banker says its a ponzi scheme. Says "EXTREMELY HIGH TRANSACTION FEES". For a reason why it sucks. Like I've never used an ATM that charges $3 to use, or a store that has a Minimum for cards. The reason he can say this is because they stole all the miners to BCH.  
The banks don't want something that they don't get any action in. Their future is fading if people switch to crypto instead of having a checking account.

Tax havens are tax havens, basically you pay a smaller fee. Weed sounds great but that would be against the law. I'm not sure if withdrawing your bitcoins in another country that has lower taxes is actually illegal. I wonder how expensive it would be. I'm not a pro in this. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:31:39
doesn't look far off from bitcoin after the fork got called off, spike then a couple rebounds then down. Im not a BCH guy just throwing that out there
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:19:44
I've been waiting for a correction since 3,000(after I sold out at 600) SO YEAH F ME. Bought in at 7,000 again

You would have to do something about re-entry. Make it easier to mine the longer you've been mining. So if you mine for a year straight then its 1% easier to mine than someone entering. The problem is you don't want to make it harder for new entries. This would make it more centralized. I have no idea how you mine or if this is possible. But it seems like something that could probably work. You wouldn't want to sacrifice that hair of an advantage you have over other people just for 4 days of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:01:45
makes sense.

Hey I have electricity included in my rent. You want to come over and set up this whole system for me? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:25:54
I have a considerable % of my savings in BTC. Hold it until I make a profit or die! Yes, Im bitting my finger nails watching Gdax. But you can't freak out and sell thats screwed me over before. Just hold and Hold and hold. If I listened to hold before I would probably be retired by now. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:29:57
I went to try to buy some but everything was down fuck coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:20:11
probably should find out how much cash it can put out. I know in normal ATMs(in the US) they usually don't have much over $1,000 unless its a big bank one.

@_date: 2017-11-14 22:03:45
in the world of cyrto thats not really much
I think it will crash next week once people realize its a scam
Also I think BCH being 1200 and BTC 6500, when BCH was 600 BTC was 7100. So I am rooting for it to crash and burn
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:26:57
weak hands were killed off at the 5500 drop, Im assuming it will breakout to 12,000 everyone who bought in at 10,000 will sell out and it will drop to 8,000 then bounce back to 15,000
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:15:42
then buy more dipshit
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:19:07
I gave it a value of $6,500 without the fork. I've been pretty right on that. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:35:55
it took me longer than that.

well im going to cold storage with my coins
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:09:25
I wouldn't go to an ATM they have cameras on them. You have to withdraw to traveler's checks or bearer bonds, get that in the mail. Make it a very small amount. Deposit it over a period of time
if you're cashing out 200,000 or so you can afford the trip to switzerland

@_date: 2017-11-30 19:09:33
its being compared to multiple stocks and houses that are not homogenous product like bitcoin
just look at gold, bitcoin's best comparable. Even though bitcoin alot easier to use as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:36:45
this happened to me too. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:52:19
so when is the price going back up?
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:25:15
Well Im a legit BTC Billionaire and I plan on buying billions of BTC tomorrow after you sell. I also have a 12 inch dick
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:38:03
coinbase is just bad with fees, they are very strict and track your txs. They are also working with IRS. I used them initially because its user friendly, but I'm definitely moving to a different exchange after I get my BCH that they have been holding for months. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:41:27
so the actual coin data is still in your wallet, but the key is on the thumb drive? So someone can't hack and send your funds somewhere else

@_date: 2017-11-12 21:02:05
i was just saying that was the theory when they designed bitcoin. Miners are rewarded with coins. So they wouldn't want it to be worthless
Obviously, they could sell them or trade them for BCH. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:30:19
yeah i just dont remember how much BTC it was. Not alot but free money is nice
found the approx value, .0125
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:10:24
Damn it I've been trying to sell at 6900 so I could buy at this pending dip
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:23:08
this is some jordan belford shit, where they buy low, then pour everything into buy this stock(buy BCH) raise the value a shit ton then slowly sell off to maximize value. Then it comes back down once the public realized it was one group of ppl inflating the value
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:17:46
It will be worth the most during economic crisis so I don't see it being worth less than 10k since its 10k in a good economy(all praise trump)
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:09:25
great news Im an idiot. For what ever reason they updated their website so I thought I was looking at overall transactions but it was only for btc transactions and I had to go to my USD wallet to see that it is still pending. FUCKING coinbase its been like 8 days

Electricity is included in my rent. How can I take full advantage of this?
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:31:42
seriously, I'll bet you any amount of bitcoins I can prove it
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:24:07
Is it a bubble or is bitcoin trying to find its value? Its a bull market for sure. Bitcoin will be highly volatile for its entire existence, gold is the same way. As currency with no centralized government controlling its growth it will be hard to judge. Governments print money to keep growth stable they also buy back money when it goes down in value reducing supply forcing higher value for money. This is why bitcoin will be suspect to massive speculation. 
Bitcoin will be worth the most during financial crisis, so I don't think we have seen it reach full bubble yet. We see this happen in zimbabwe and Venezula we also see it with gold. Being deflationary people will protect themselves from inflation by buying Bitcoins.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:15:35
hey if Im due BCH in coinbase and I also bought more BTC if I sell do I lose my claim to BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:07:31
exactly, you got to take it out in small chunks over a period of time
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:49:43
I thought it was dumb until I noticed a spam bot. They literally post about how shitty bitcoin is on every page. I'm very curious to who would do this. I don't buy into people wanting bitcoin to fail because its my belief that bitcoin is too big to fail(Bitcoin is the only coin a normal person knows as actually holding value, it has brand value to the masses). For any crytocurrency to do well they need bitcoin to do well. The only reason for an attack would be to drive BTC price down to buy it based on predictions that it will be worth a TON once the mainstream accepts it as currency. Talk to anyone over 45-50 about Bitcoin they probably know the name but have no idea how it works and think its fake money. If bitcoin crashes they will reinforce their belief that cyptocurrency IS fake money. So you think they would use ALTcoins they have never heard of? Nah. 
This is just my long term theory. I lived my whole life on a golf course with rich old guys and I always try to get them to invest(some of them do, I have made them crazy profits). But they still are very hesitant to invest in bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:55:19
Im sure there's a solution. Bitcoin is the tried and true method. All other ALTcoins were worth nothing for a very long time until 7 months ago. Currency isn't like phones where you can come out with new updated ones every year. People will place value in Bitcoin with higher fees because its proven to work. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:15:03
Sounds like an awesome way for someone who is on the run to get a good place. Not saying anything is wrong with that. Surprised no one has thought of this before
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:20:44
so how do I see how much BCH I have? I left like $15 in bitcoins in my account but I dont see any
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:07:49
when you sell you can only do two things, make money or lose money. If you don't sell you technically haven't lost a dime

@_date: 2017-11-15 02:10:57
I have purchased LTC to hold on to. I think BTC has a problem with fees but I'm assuming they will fix that. Either though fork or though lightning network that hit 90% integration. 
Banks are afraid of bitcoin because it takes away their power. I think banks want more control which is why they push for BCH so they can control it

I don't disagree with it being pumped by people buying for S2X. I would point to the price spiking after it was called off as an indicator that there were alot of people waiting to re-invest after S2X. So it will offset. I think 6,500 will be the lowest it hits

There will be a slight dip, but the fork caused instability, now bitcoin is still king. If the currency did split the price would have probably dropped after anyways
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:56:36
Still has better tools to sell and buy with. I bought 1,000 of coinbase, I should have used Gdax and bought using the limit tool
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:27:12
I wouldn't sell for Fiat. Sell for gold, sell for anything but fiat. Harder it is for the IRS to value.

@_date: 2017-11-27 05:37:39
Thats because the FEDs issue bonds to buy back money or sell money using interest/discount rates to produce inflation or deflation. In economic there are short term and long term models. Bitcoin's are limited to 21 million and that means deflationary in the long run. 
Fiat currency has to be inflationary because most governments are in a deficit. So they need to print more money. Deflation of fiat currency would be very bad for the economy

Buddy, those youtubers probably already have Bcash so they want more ppl to buy to increase their value. Then they will it before it crashes make a ton. Thats why they are smart guys. The main reason that I don't invest in Bcash is that coinbase has been holding 30% of it. Which will be released in January. Then everyone is gonna be dumping it.

Its about liquidity too, Mining only produces so many coins(less and less each year), holders not selling causes very very few coins on the actual market. This causes the price to go up. In the 60s gold became worth $40 an ounce when the dollar pegged it at $35 an ounce, to defeat this attack on the dollar they dump 900 million dollars of gold per month on the market driving the price back down. Supply and Demand.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:17:27
wow hit the nail on the head
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:39:53
not to be a dick, but isn't the whole idea of mining and shit is that its in the miners best interests if they own alot of bitcoins to make sure bitcoin doesn't tank like it did now

I'm sure you could find a broker or ATM with fees a lot smaller than income tax/capital gains. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:47:38
yeah i tried to do that once and almost lost my mind. Sold at 7100 tried to wait for the dip ended up buying it all back at 7200 now its 9400, I took a 20-40 dollar loss.

Im sure any company using coinfuckbase would have to keep this in mind if they ever used their paypal fuck button. 
Yes theres alot of hate in my blood. Using LIFO I can claim a loss so the government is gonna end up giving me a tax deduction but seriously pissed me off. Nobody likes a snitch.

I maybe a cynical asshole but I always see these posts and people think its a great thing that a yacht company will accept bitcoin. Thats not adoption in my opinion. Theres not millions of people buying yachts. I see yachts, 10+ million dollar houses, lambos(lol) and I just think it means nothing(well very very little). Now if walmart, costco... you know like places that 99%ers use start taking bitcoin then that would be something to celebrate. 
Im sure I will be downvoted to bolivian but show me an article about a company that people actual use accept bitcoins right now its basically overstock.com and KFC. Sorry for my rant, Im a depressed asshole

Yeah my GF's dad works for the IRS(for like 50 years no joke he worked for them when he was in college). He's a super nerd about accounting. He told me that any gains over $600 is suppose to be reported. So if you sell a TV or Car rims for $600 cash you're suppose to report that. 
He's gonna help me out so thats good
