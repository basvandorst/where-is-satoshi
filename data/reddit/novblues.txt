This cold snap here is really tough. That's for sure. Been freezing at night the past few nights.

Well for one, banks would not be a thing. Less corruption via transparency on Blockchain. Most importantly, these economy collapses you are seeing wouldn't be happening!
@_date: 2019-11-05 15:20:07
I'm speechless....
Hard to say after reading this that BTC isn't going to save countries form complete and total collapse. 
FIAT is crashing ladies and gents...buckle up.

In its own due time BTC will finally be accepted as an alternative currency in the US markets. It just takes time for these guys to understand the underlying platform and tech behind the scenes. Look at China, they are already having a brighter view of crypto. We all know, with acceptance in the China community means the US is the runner-up.

These charts tell a truly horrific story of how Fiat currency is not aging well with the times. I must say it's a spectacle to see how this will all play out.

Not sure about this. To me, it looks like we are testing support @ 9500. There might be a "pullback" but back to 8k after the last 3 days? Not so sure about their outlook there.

I think the USA will stomp their little idea into dust. They might be able to form a national currency that way but to enforce it among the rest of the world population is going to be be, well.... not going to happen.

Millions of transactions have been completed using Bitcoin. This is nothing new. Bitcoin is used as currency daily, even though the media makes it seem like because of its wishy washy price it can't be used as such. This is simply not true. The case being that anyone using Bitcoin as a currency is interested in storing it and cashing out during the highs. It's that simple. Exchange for service/FIAT at a set rate based on a daily value (whatever that might be at whatever time) and store and wait for the perfect time to cash out. 
The highs and lows come with the territory.... It's Bitcoin. ��

I started avoiding them when they needed several blood samples, my mother's maiden name, and my dad's first girlfriend's birthday. Fuck KYC/AML laws. They took the underlying principle of Bitcoin and pissed all over it...

The FBI is just another defunct branch of the DOJ. Look at all the heat they have taken in just the past 3 years for breaking legal procedure.

Not to mention, Elon Musk, PayPal's co founder has promoted the use and hodl of BTC since he gained international spotlight.

Bitstamp and Coin-base are very shady with their selective screening procedures. Be careful using either one they are known to track the addresses that you send your coin to and ban even legit users at free will as I see you discovered. Just a word of warning to anyone else whom is thinking of using either platform. Decentralized exchanges cannot come fast enough \*cough cough\* BISQ.

Talk about a breakout.....NICE!
@_date: 2019-10-25 04:41:39
Nice to know that some people are still pioneers still today. I jumped in 2013 and I can say its been one hell of a ride. I cannot say anything negative about the market though. I still have faith that with some underlying stability improvements on behalf of trading platforms and less anti-cypto law makers we can still achieve global market adoption.

" Bitcoin seemed to be riding on the back of Libra in terms of price." 0.o
What do you mean by this? I dont see the correlation between those two topics at all. Libra is not BTC not even close. Sure, they use the same underlying tech but that's not the point.  The principal difference between **Libra** **and** **Bitcoin** is that **Libra** is a so-called “stable coin”. A stable coin is a **cryptocurrency** that is stable against a reference value. A **Libra** will always be exchangeable for a decided amount of a currency unit. A **Bitcoin**, however, is not known to be stable.

When BTC falls I go into my living room and just blast "let the bodies hit the floor" by Drowning Pool. 
I find this to be soothing...

LBC is slowly and painfully killing itself. They have decided to follow the AML/KYC model of operation. This now makes sure that the trade platform has basically IDd everyone before a transaction can even occur. This royally fucks people who seek anonymity and crashes the safe haven status for those whom are using their coin nefariously. But, with all this implementation they have come to find that criminals only go more into the shadows. The regular Joe is just plain old inconvenienced by this new system. 
BISQ for the win!!!!

Hard check NO!
@_date: 2019-10-31 18:50:53
In all seriousness, how many of you would straight up sh!t your pants if all the sudden it did happen?
 I personally wouldn't be all that surprised. With all the blockchain adoption talks and with reserve currency status on the line I only see BTC going up with the common adoption and regulatory process.

Thanks for the laughs!!!
@_date: 2019-10-25 15:09:42
Yes, and no. Implementing blockchain in society helps people understand the underlying principle of how the BTC ecosystem works. However, this is not the way that paves to mass adoption. We continue to wait as politicians slowly come to light with FIATs epic collapse. The fact that they are still ignoring the problems we face with our currency just means the crash will be that much more epic. Long live BTC and HODL away!!!!
