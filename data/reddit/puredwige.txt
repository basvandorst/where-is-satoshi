This is a drawing used to show annoyance in mangas, the same used on all the bills earlier in the videos.

Quick question : why do you need a 100 cubes ? I recently undertook to learn speedcubing (right now trying to learn the 57 bloody OLL algorithm, it feels like I'll need a year), and I'm quite content with my lone speed cube. Why did you buy so many?

It's really just a personal feeling. Strictly speaking, it's just an English word, but it's not a common term. There is a very active community of bitcoin enthusiasts on the Internet, who will jump to the defence of their currency whenever possible, too often with rants or heavy sarcasm. One dead giveaway that they are a part of this community is that they will use the word fiat every two sentences. Worst, some people use it as a noun (fiat can be a noun but it doesn't mean fiat currency). I think that the overuse of the word fiat will get associated with those people and one risks being ignored because people instinctively don't trust those that they feel are biased. 
Using it in a long comment or article is of course fine, but don't abuse it is all I'm saying, there are many other suitable adjectives (regulated, government controlled, official, traditional,...)

My personal experience is that it's still way too complicated to use. I have read tons of stuff on bitcoins, am subscribed to and yet I still don't feel confident to take the jump. When someone like me who is young and tech savvy can't figure out how to use it, there is a problem. There is a desperate need for clear, simple and beautiful tutorials to replace the shitty wikis and youtube videos. 
The second thing is security, right now it feels like you need a degree in computer security to protect yourself from theft.

I think that the argument should rather go somewhere along the lines of: 




I'd personally advise against using the word "fiat" anywhere in your argumentation, as this will label you as partisan in the debate, and you'd lose all credibility.
