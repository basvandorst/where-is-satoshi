When it comes to payouts I think p2pool and GBT are pretty similar if you happen to have a low-latency connection and a SSD drive.
Whatever dust is lost in p2pool because of transaction fee costs is probably offset by the fact that 100% of the coins mined by the pool, as well as the fees from processed transactions go to the miners, as there are no fees going to a pool operator.
However I do realize that not all miners will have the low-latency mining infraestructure required by p2pool and for them using GBT will be their best option if they care about protecting the Bitcoin network as much as possible.

Butterfly Labs is already using a 65-nanometer precision manufacturing process. Still, I'm glad to see us moving towards a competitive mining ASICs market. The more players joining the game the better it will be for us miners.

I think the OP meant to write "their customers".

Almost half of the article talks about Bitcoin. They mention Mt. Gox, Silk Road and even BitPay...

: I hope you don't mind if I cite the description of pooled-solo mining and its benefits from your post, for those who might have not heard about it before.
I really hope more miners and pools move towards more decentralized mining methods such as the ones offered by either GBT or the p2pool project, as they provide greater security to the Bitcoin network than Stratum does in its current implementation:

I have been a Dropbox user for years and find it much better than Google Drive or Microsoft SkyDrive because of Dropbox using encryption for file storage while Google and Microsoft aren't. Of course, I would like them even more if they began accepting Bitcoin. +6 from me!

I really like your idea mthreat. I think it has the potential to massively increase Bitcoin adoption in the average Gmail user population.

Have you heard about the [ICANN](

: I realize your account balance is missing 0.13847532 BTC, however stating that BIPS is stealing from their customers is a serious accusation.
I see that in your post you linked to [this page]( which states the following:


I don't think you should spread FUD when there could be a number of reasons that might explain the difference.
You don't seem to have provided enough evidence to support the claim that BIPS "stole" the coins from you.

I also wonder how their business model works. I'm pretty impressed with their ability to operate without charging any fees to their users
