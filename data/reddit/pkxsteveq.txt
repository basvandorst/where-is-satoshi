Clearly written by someone who doesn't understand shit regarding how blockchain works and consequently why it's secure and truly decentralized, probably in economy field without any knowledge of IT, and that joined the speculation spiral fueling this recent crazy bubble hoping to make some quick money...

Like I already said: you can't disagree with facts...

I don't come from r/btc, I come from academic research wher your "r/btc" and "r/bitcoin" religions are completely ignored.
There's nothing to argue because "miners dictate the protocol" it's not an opinion, it's a FACT (in Bitcoin at least) inferred from Nakamoto consensus.

Yes, that's exactly right: Bitcoin now would be in the hands of that one miner because of 2 simple reasons:
1) non-miner nodes have only veto power but not vote power; sure you could consider a block invalid, but without a miner to build a block on top of it your blockchain stops there;
2) overwhelming majority of miners on a different protocol, means that you have overwhelming majority of hostile colluding miners against the original protocol: the security property is broken and the original protocol is now valued 0.
Welcome to Nakamoto consensus, as per Bitcoin whitepaper, where miners vote with their hashpower and dictate the protocol.

Except you "haven't made" 450% until you cash out that 450%. That 9% is true gain, that 450% is pure virtual gain that can easily become -100% in a day.

There no "attack": there's a centralized cartel of developers keeping Bitcoin at 1Mb for their own interests and hurting miner's profit, they then deceived the miners into accepting Segwit and now miners, the only ones who hold "consensus", are going with the most profitable route (which is the same exact principle that keeps Bitcoin secure).
