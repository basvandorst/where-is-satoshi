Government is not a god. They are just people with agendas who want to make money and gain power. 
The bitcoin network is more adaptive than any single organization can be. The market is not goverment controlled and this why the world supports it, because it is free money. The idea of controllerless currency was been let loose and no one can take it back.
They can try and co-opt it, but there is no central power in bitcoin to co-opt. Powerful miners come and go. Developers come and go. Exchanges come and go. All are skattered to the ends of the earth and no earthly power can capture us. We are legion.

Don't forget; merchant adoption drives price deflation in the short term. This may be included in the reasons for the pullback from $470 to $450.

Yeah. They think they need to pay millions of dollars to see their code.

This. Love it. Like the AntRouters. You are never going to win, but why not play.

I think you fail to see the real use of these foundations. /s

A. You have never heard of  ? 
B. I have (when BTC was around $3, $15, $99, &amp; $260, it was a good deal). Plenty do, when they do not have access to western banks.
C. Your caims come off lazy and ill-informed.

So with a 2% CC cashback it is still 1%? Sounds good. Is it instant?

Do you have evidence of this? Because it comes off as conjecture and slanderous. 
Everything Purse says is they are acting on an arbitrage opportunity between those who get paid in Amazon credit, using BTC to get into local currency. They also state, they take a hard stance of fraud. 
Plus, Amazon shuts  down fraudulent accounts.
Purse.io is fantastic for those who want to spend BTC, not so much for those who want to buy BTC with a debit card.

Your coins never went anyway, but the Coinbase database you are trusting has issues. Move at least have of them to a multisig wallet that you control and have redundant backups of.
@_date: 2016-06-14 03:45:17
I think that was a joke.

"blowup"? How about, "theft"!

They appear to have similar functionality. I did not realize Electrum  had mobile apps.

I thought all the cool kids say, "HODOL", now.
Edit: I pretty sure my mobile just autocorrect HODOL to HODL.

But what will that be able to buy, by then.

Those are not the figures I have seen.

I go back and forth, on  but needless to say I use to be a USD and Stockbug, but still have the silver/goldbug. Crypto currency is infinanitely more usable.

Okay, thanks. I will stick with cash for 1% and a 4 day wait.

No virtual machine,  no extra privaledgeless account, just a good encrypted wallet and multisig.
Copay can handle that. Setup a multisig wallet with PC and phone. Use different passwords to encrypt each wallet.

It's a buy!

I think you still have to release the funds from escrow, but contact support first. Purse will give you the order id, by which you can request a  return label or refund (for damaged nonreturnable items). Amazon will credit your account the full dollar amount paid for the item. The original purchaser has nothing to do with the process.

It's really simple. He had visitors at MIT that explained with all these child porn busts happening it would be a shame if his computers where seized as evidence.  And all you have do to prevent that is make an effort to confirm Craig as Satoshi. 
Gavin will know the community will get to the bottom if it and think taking the deal has some outs.
What he did not realized is that Blockstream would jump at this to revoke his privelages and they should when on is comprised. 
Never take the deal.

This was part of the plan.
