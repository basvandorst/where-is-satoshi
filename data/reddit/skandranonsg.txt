Nope. I don't believe in get rich quick schemes. I mined a few coins in 2012-2014, spent them, and haven't interacted with Bitcoin since.

True, this wilderness I spoke of probably doesn't exist in the US. 
But how exactly would a modern society function without taxes? It's like the old saying "A person is smart, but people are dumb." I believe a group of individuals simply don't have the ability to coordinate to the point of a tax-fed government to build and maintain the infrastructure required to live like a first world country.
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:17:07
Then go live where there are no taxes. Build yourself a shelter in the wilderness and don't use any service whatsoever payed for or subsidized by taxpayer money.

Yep. People are greedy by nature. We genetically programmed to accumulate wealth, and despite being "higher" beings, we are still slave to most of our instincts. If perfect freedom comes at the cost of being shot for my kitkat, they can tax me to hell and back. Mind you, my example was a little hyperbolic, but I believe you understand my meaning.


Sounds to me like anarchy, which isn't necessarily bad by nature. The only problem is that leads to a pretty much unrestricted free market. Quite frankly, people are not smart enough to operate in an unrestricted free market without being taken advantage of. It becomes valuable to those with a lot of money to keep those without a lot of money uneducated, so they aren't able to make wise purchasing decisions, which is the backbone of a free market.

Open waters. Or an unclaimed island are pretty much your only choices here. But for the sake of argument, let's assume that this hypothetical wilderness exists. I assert that your quality of life or the quality of life of any number of individuals would not come even close to what it would be under a government that taxes its citizens and uses those taxes on infrastructure and regulation.

Man cave is a marketing scam. It's a multi-level marketing thing where you throw parties for your buds and try to sell them useless barbeque shit and other "manly" things. You get to pay for all your own samples of beer and steak and shit, and you rarely make more than enough to cover your expenses. Meanwhile the company pays almost no money to have you and your friends sell and buy their shit.
The success rate in those types of jobs is absurdly low. Unless you've got the devil's silver tongue, have fun wasting days to months of your life.

It's anonymous in the sense that a bitcoin wallet isn't tied to a name. You have to find a way to link that wallet to an IP address, bank account, physical address, etc.
There are ways to make this anonymous, but it requires a lot more work than just sending your buy/sell requests through an exchange or local wallet.

I would argue that government is necessary to a fairly large degree for a few reasons, and desirable in others. 
The invisible hand is simply incapable of optimizing certain services necessary for our modern society, such as roads and utilities. For example, how in the world can anyone compete if your neighborhood's roadway company is doing a poor job or charging too much for maintainence? A competitor can't simply move in and put a parallel road. You'd have to remove the old company somehow, but who would do that? Without taxes your police force is also a private contractor, and what's stopping them from just taking a bribe from the road company...
Anyways, I'm drifting deeper down the rabbit hole here. If you have genuine solutions to things like necessary public utilities in a world where there's no taxation, I'm curious to hear them.
@_date: 2018-10-30 19:38:51
Nope. There is competition, theoretically, but the big ones collude to keep prices high in Alberta.
Can't do that in a place where they have to actually compete, such as Saskatchewan.

I can't speak to comcast specifically, but I can speak to why I believe internet should be run by a public company.
I live in Alberta where we have 3 big telecoms and a half dozen smaller ones. Pretty much everyone colludes to keep prices sky high. A 5 GB cell phone plan costs about $90-100/mo from the big 3, and ~$60/mo from the smaller ones.
Just one province over, with somewhat similar demographics and land mass (actually much more spread out), Saskatchewan has a similar situation with 3 big telecoms and a few smaller ones. However, the big 3's plans are $50/mo at their most expensive! Why? Because they have to compete with the provincial telecom. SaskTel is a crown corporation run by the government whose mandate is to provide telecom services to Saskatchewan residents instead of pursuing maximum profits.

It's pedantic because whether you make a politician behave a certain way through force or by replacing him with one will be complicit, you still achieve your goals. All the moral high ground gets you is kicked out of office when multi-billion dollar entities decide they want you to act a certain way.
@_date: 2015-08-03 13:42:49
No, this simply serves to illustrate that technology trends from physical to electronic to internet. Bitcoin is the next logical step in this pattern with regards to currency. No one is suggesting it will be as easy as you've strawmanned it to be.

"If you don't steal narcotics from your work for me, I'll get you fired and make sure you never work for a pharmacy again. You and your family will go bankrupt."
Is that person being *influenced* or *forced* to steal narcotics? Regardless of which word you use to describe it, the politicians making shitty laws are being **coerced** by corporations to make laws and vote in a certain way.

They most certainly do force their hand. "I'll donate $10k to your re-election campaign if you pass this law. Oh, you object on moral grounds? Okay, I'll donate that money to your opponent."

A pedantic distinction. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 01:18:44


The only thing I want to illustrate is that giving someone a choice between two very extreme outcomes is effectively not giving them a choice at all. When the corporate/union entities funnel the tremendous amount of money they do towards influencing politics, they remove the choice of the politicians. I'm not trying to say that there are no corrupt politicians and that they're just victims of the system, but there is still something very very wrong with the system.


Do you honestly believe that electing officials with demonstrated morals is ineffective?
Yes, there are some hot button issues that get forced into the public eye and are addressed by government, like gay marriage. But what about the outcry for less "sexy" issues like the TPP or the many-headed beast that is SOPA.


I say it, because that's what the data says.
@_date: 2015-07-15 23:01:33


That's why it's called a hypothetical. It's a situation meant to illustrate a point.


No, they're being coerced by the fact that a significant donation to their political opponent means they lose their job. You underestimate the power of lobbying money if you think you can just ignore them.
Given the choice between a large sum of money and losing your job when the only price to pay is to vote on a law that probably won't affect you directly anyways, it would take a ludicrously willful and idealistic individual to resist. And even then, all that idealism and resistance gets you is your ass out the door.

BTC didn't reach dollar parity until early 2011, and the first exchanges were open early 2010.
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:20:40
Regret? No. While it would have been great to buy coins early and strike it rich, the same could be said about thousands of other opportunities that I passed on. 
However, that's a fallacy, because without a crystal ball or time machine, there's no way to know for sure which opportunities would have ended well for me and which of the order of magnitude other opportunities would have failed. As a man with a family and financial commitments Bitcoin is far too volatile for me to trust with my most critical investments like retirement and my kid's education.
It's fun to dream about what would have happened if I had bought coins back when I first heard of it and the exchange rate was $1/200 BTC, but a not at all reasonable regret.
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:03:34

Keep that fucking filthy pump and dump scam out of this subreddit.
With all the negativity, I should explain myself. I'm sick of seeing all these altcoins spring up and gain popularity. Then people who don't really know anything about the world of finance and trading think they're on to something, so they dump money into it. Then the little bubble pops, and you end up with a ton of people losing a lot of money.
Not only that, but it hurts bitcoin's public image as a whole. I found dogecoin amusing, but to those not in on that joke it becomes just one more reason not to take bitcoin seriously. Then you get people who want to buy bitcoin that now buy it with dogecoin on whatever exchange takes it having a negative effect on the price of bitcoin.
Tl;dr, funny joke. Stupid coin.
