Partial extract from Investopedia:
Inflation is both good and bad, depending upon which side one takes.
Individuals with tangible assets, like property or stocked commodities, may like to see some inflation as that raises the value of their assets which they can sell at a higher rate (sound familiar, Bitcoin community?).
People holding cash may not like inflation, as it erodes the value of their cash holdings. 
Inflation promotes investments, both by businesses in projects and by individuals in stocks of companies, as they expect better returns than inflation.
An optimum level of inflation is required to promote spending to a certain extent instead of saving. 
If the purchasing power of money remains the same over the years, it may limit spending, which may negatively impact the overall economy as decreased money circulation will slow overall economic activities in a country. 
The main issue with fiat inflation is that there is no public ledger to verify that the creation of new money is in accordance with what is being communicated and what is necessary based on current economic conditions. 
Currency is a vehicle which facilitates exchange; if it becomes more valuable to posses than the goods or services it serves the system of exchange will quickly deteriorate.

And this is a prime example of why bitcoin has not yet experienced mass adoption

Inflation is healthy for an economy as it encourages the spending of the given currency. One of Bitcoin’s biggest dilemmas is that it is deflationary which encourages hoarding/hodling. Money/cash is transactional and should not be viewed as an investment. Bitcoin will complement financial markets but is not in a position to replace everyday currencies.

Serious question, why is there a decimal in the Total Number of Bitcoins? Are they not mined whole?
