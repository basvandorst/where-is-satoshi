So Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen are just banker cronies. You can't really be serious. Do you know who these people are and what they have done in their careers. They are just academics the Fed is largely just controlled by the fads academic economists.

In so far as that is true it has literally nothing to do with fiat currency or the Fed. It's just a non sequitur.

Yeah, no. The Fed is controlled by the government. It gets its mandate from congress and the board of governors are appointed by the president and approved by congress. The Fed must answer to congress on all its policy decisions though it is given large leeway. The private banks you are talking about are members of the Federal Reserve System and all that really gets them is having to follow the rules and regulations created by the independent Fed. The interest it earns from the bonds the Fed buys goes straight back to the Treasury. The only reason the Fed owns bonds is so they don't have to beg Treasury for money if they have to reduce the money supply to keep inflation contained.

Debt has nothing to do with fiat currency. A government can borrow regardless of what currency they use, they could use sheep as money and the government could sell bonds just the same. You people are absurd you don't understand the basics of what a fiat currency is or how the system works.

This is the kind of high quality response I would expect from someone totally ignorant on the topic he discusses.

I agree that banking regulations are a mess and need to be reformed. Yellen's main job, why she was hired and what she had impeccable credentials for, is to manage US monetary policy. She has done a fine job at that and managing monetary policy is 1000x more important that stupid corporate scandals.

The Fed is a government owned corporation it is not private in the least. All profits go to the Treasury. To say the debt is owned by the Fed is just to say it is owned by the US government. It's just an accounting fiction they use so the Fed and Treasury can stay operationally distinct for the most part.

So you decided to bet on a highly volatile asset instead of investing in a properly diversified portfolio? What possible reason could a person have for doing that except the thrill of gambling. I mean good look at the slots buddy just don't pretend this is anywhere close to a good idea.

The Government Accountability Office audits them several times a year. The Fed is a very efficient well run institution. I disagree about how they have often conducted monetary policy, mostly in not doing enough to stabilize the monetary system; but they are an impeccable institution and one that has most clearly complied with it's government mandate and all the laws and regulations that they are beholden too.

I learned about monetary economics in textbooks not weird internet videos.

Who else has as much experience in monetary economics? Everyone knowledgeable on the topic approved of her. You who know nothing but pronounce upon everything thinks differently, what do I care? Fiat currency has nothing to do with the 1% or the big banks. The big mistake the Fed made was allowing aggregate demand to fall in 2008 and not then afterwards making up the difference. Yellen has largely kept aggregate demand growing on trend so what can we say to impeach her?

I mean if you have tens of thousands at least in other assets then I can see wanting to diversify into bitcoin, diversification means owning a little bit of everything. However, you shouldn't let the rather juvenile hype of a bunch of what are essentially gambling addicts and economic cranks, affect you. They are like people who go up to a roulette wheel, put 100 on black and win, and from then on keep pilling more on black thinking that it's a good option because it worked before. 
Financial markets price in information well, adjusting for the base interest rate and the risk the expected return going forward is about zero, if it wasn't the price of bitcoin would be higher right now. 
If you are a minor then I would just keep the money in a bank. Use it to pay for college or to just have liquid savings for yourself. No reason to take a risk when you probably going to want to use that money soon anyway.
