That's awesome to hear. Same here. I've learned more about money through bitcoin than I ever did prior to it. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 18:12:39
You sure would
What's the minimum amount everyone would have to give you to be rich AF though?

I love shitcoins if they make me more satoshis 
@_date: 2016-08-01 18:43:00
Ok thanks. How did you hook up with breadwallet API? I just want to review that from their end.

@_date: 2016-08-01 18:43:23
@_date: 2016-08-01 19:21:15
Ok cool. Checked that out and feel comfortable thank you!
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:28:10
Split between breadwallet, trezor and paper wallet. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:32:08
I think two things some argue is negative about PoS it is that there is inflation forever and you can't mine it. 
Anyone know more about those two aspects?
@_date: 2016-08-07 18:19:35
Mine has worked for the last 6 months
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:40:58
Bitcoin is a brand new asset class that we've never seen before. 
You can't stick it anywhere on the graph. 
It has properties of 4 other asset classes.
See if you can find what those are. 
Bitcoin is the closest humankind has come to a perfect asset and has inspired many others. Bitcoin stands to be the bedrock for even more perfect assets to be created. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:29:01
Love it
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:56:56
I think that's the best idea. I found that most altcoins are easy to generate a paper wallet and send to BUT importing to spend can be difficult and require downloading the blockchain or digging through forum posts from 2 years ago. 
Double check the import is straightforward and then move them. If not, leaving them on the exchange and taking the risk might be your best bet. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 18:14:35
If a friend asks what it is I tell them it's a bitcoin safe and hand it to them. 
Then I tell them there are some BTC on there and they can try and steal them. 
They can't and it's a fun way to explain it to them
@_date: 2016-08-01 18:41:56
Right 
@_date: 2016-08-07 18:11:52
Thanks for the heads up. I'm going to sign up too
@_date: 2016-08-07 18:15:50
Yea it's awesome. A lot smaller than I expected but cool looking and secure. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 00:56:34
why wouldn't an average consumer want the perfect asset when they've been investing in imperfect assets this whole time?
@_date: 2016-08-07 18:19:16
Haha yea in theory...if you trust your tattoo artist and keep the tattoo hidden 
@_date: 2015-01-23 01:23:08
Awesome! Just put it $150 today. 
I use Coinbase as well. How has Coinbase been for large purchases? Do you keep all your coins there and feel pretty good at night they're safe? I worry sometimes. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 12:06:53
Coinbase has an instant purchase feature. You get the bitcoin immediately if you also link a credit card. 
I have linked a credit card as well as my checking so I get the bitcoin immediately and then the money is withdrawn from my checking about 2 days later. 
Keep in mind, the credit card is not charged in this instance. It is just required to get the instant bitcoin. And also, the instant is limited to $1,000 a day.  
@_date: 2015-01-23 01:05:12
I can only speak for coinbase. 
When I buy, I typically see the withdrawal from my checking account 2 days later. 
When I sell I typically see the deposit in...oh wait I've never sold before. I'm in for the long run...but you get the point. 
Two days about. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 01:01:36
What's the price though?
@_date: 2016-09-11 14:30:25
Ahh I don't believe you can split it across multiple drives. It has to be on one that can fit the whole blockchain
@_date: 2016-09-27 22:57:29
 I like that you're doing this. Thanks!
@_date: 2016-09-11 20:05:02
Trading on Poloniex is fun and helps the community by adding volume and liquidity for traders
@_date: 2015-04-18 13:35:36
Fantastic 
@_date: 2015-04-08 02:36:32
Well said
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:55:30
@_date: 2015-04-08 02:39:21
Agreed 100%. When price is 10k a coin will be elite. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 02:37:28
Yea so tough part would be not selling at 100,200,300 etc
@_date: 2015-04-23 20:08:02
Thanks Satoshi!
@_date: 2015-04-08 22:27:54
TIL that in the first "real-world transaction with bitcoin" a programmer paid 10,000 bitcoins for 2 large Papa John's pizzas. 4 years later, those bitcoins were worth 5.12 million dollars.
@_date: 2015-04-03 12:44:22
I can do that w/ venmo. The great part is it could be spent by the receiver in about 10-20 minutes.  
@_date: 2015-04-02 18:17:18
Some one just sold .013 on bitstamp. What an idiot too!
@_date: 2015-04-02 18:16:37

Big League ^^^
@_date: 2016-10-14 22:52:07
I'd consider selling only in a downturn in order to get more
@_date: 2016-10-29 14:16:56
Come on let's all get along!
@_date: 2015-04-08 02:35:43
Yea my buddy told me to 'just put a grand in' at $1
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:35:56
Ah will do! Thanks
@_date: 2016-10-23 14:37:32
All speculation here. Follow the price guys.

@_date: 2016-10-24 23:06:59
18k unconfirmed transactions @ 23:05 UTC
That's a good amount. In the past, with this amount of unconfirmed, I've had transactions take 4 hours or so. 
Going to have to wait it out. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 01:59:47
I wish it was $350!
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:38:54
This is awesome. Thanks for the share. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:28:02
No sir
@_date: 2015-03-09 22:47:04
Will you actually respond to emails unlime coincreators haha
@_date: 2015-03-12 22:28:17
Yea backup strategy for what?
@_date: 2015-03-12 10:59:25
Used Paper wallet
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:31:29
Sweet thanks
@_date: 2015-03-10 12:44:37
Haha yea same for me too after properly hearing about it
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:27:53
My thinking exactly
@_date: 2015-03-08 18:30:22
Haha thats awesome
@_date: 2015-03-07 02:13:13
Trillion dollar market cap
@_date: 2016-10-30 19:32:28
Thoughtful! Thanks!
@_date: 2015-03-11 15:40:18
This example really helped me understand. Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 11:52:32
Nice man!
@_date: 2015-03-05 18:38:09
I believe in the NSA/CIA creation theory. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:40:14
I think so 
@_date: 2015-03-03 17:20:32
@_date: 2015-03-12 00:52:16
Yup should have put a return address. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 15:39:56
Thanks a lot this makes sense to me know
@_date: 2015-03-16 15:17:06
@_date: 2015-03-04 01:48:52
Yes it is possible. However, cert unlikely. My favorite analogy is that if computer were calculation since the beginning of the universe that maybe only by now would a pair have been found.  
@_date: 2015-03-10 11:34:59
So you can have one 2 key pair with both bitcoin and litecoin attached to it?
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:16:17
Still fortunes to be made!
@_date: 2015-03-11 23:43:53
Coinbase. 1/2 goes to different paper wallets, 1/2 stays in vault. Keep a little in breadwallet for day to day spending. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 15:17:28
Haha thats awesome
@_date: 2015-03-08 17:40:32
No, myspace was actually popular at one point in time. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 12:45:52
Im sorry man. Hopefully you'll get the last laugh. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 01:44:24
Im liking this route
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:10:04
Wish I could upvote that twice haha
@_date: 2015-03-03 01:42:05
If you can open an account with an american brokerage then yes
@_date: 2015-10-05 13:42:24
I've been waiting for this moment for all my lifeeeeee
@_date: 2015-03-02 22:53:53
Good advice sir
@_date: 2015-03-12 00:45:09
You think so?
I don't know how to prove anything. There are no accounts. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 20:42:33
This truly is an amazing product
@_date: 2015-03-08 00:32:02
Dude this is awesome thinking
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:27:22
Right, when its available tho
@_date: 2015-03-12 20:44:11
Does this make much of a difference? To me it would just streamline the USD and add legitimacy to the Bitcoin network principles. 
But oh man imagine if it got hacked then everyone would see why the Bitcoin network is superior. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 01:00:26
I'm not sure haha
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:21:25
It really has. The last week or so. Been seeing articles with a "woah, maybe there is something to Bitcoin" mentality out of forbes and fortune almost every day.
@_date: 2015-03-12 00:24:12
Sent email. Will update if they offer any sort of refund.
@_date: 2015-03-10 11:43:16
There is only one recovery phrase for breadwallet
@_date: 2015-03-07 18:17:21
I'm selling 1 coin at 5k, to recoup my investment. Then .1 every double after that. And by selling I may also just "spend."
This we keep me around 10 coins if it ever reaches astronomical levels (100k+), while also hedging and locking in some profit. 
Does anyone know of a better strategy?
@_date: 2015-02-14 12:21:27
Do you want the tip money I received?
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:15:59
@_date: 2015-03-02 23:00:34
Honestly, youre right and there is no perceived economical advantage over buying btc outright. 
My thought though is that if we all buy some of this. Boost the price then others who would otherwise not be comfortable with buying btc outright would buy this etf and we'd all gain. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 18:38:35
I really like this. 
@_date: 2015-10-05 13:41:28
I've been waiting for this moment all my lifeeeeee
@_date: 2015-03-13 21:38:31
Could have meant if bitcoin fails?
@_date: 2015-02-21 23:48:08
What's freenode?
@_date: 2015-02-25 01:49:27
No its not
@_date: 2015-02-24 21:39:48
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:00:10
My mom just starts to worry that I'm losing my money haha but yes you're right. I do talk with her about it, but would like a friend my age to car for once. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 00:51:56
Source? Picture of newspaper?
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:42:53
You are. I work with developers (I'm a software tester). Mentioned it to one and he looked at me like I was nuts. It's really incredible the stigma it has. I can only imagine it's because it truly points out fundamental flaws in how we exchange value. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 23:19:06
But that's how you plant the idea in the younger generations head and drive organic growth. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 23:51:19
Yes. Very annoying. Sometimes it seems as if the codes don't register when sending multiple times in a short time period
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:33:44
Very interesting idea. I like it a lot. May take the idea and just give a substantial amount to someone that I think would become interested due to that. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 22:06:26
Thanks will do!
@_date: 2015-02-22 02:50:02
Lol no it means direct message
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:44:14
I've wondered the same thing myself. 
It's possible for someone to try private keys over and over and eventually get one right. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 16:39:17
Id tip him $20 bucks
@_date: 2015-02-22 04:01:11
To have 1 friend that loves bitcoin as much as I do or 60 friends that don't give a shit. That is the questions haha
Plus I want 1 friend to be rich with me when in 10 years. They're gonna miss out. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 02:05:38
@_date: 2015-02-26 01:59:39
Ahhh come on! We all want to rub it in their face after they've laughed at us for this long. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:02:05
This is true
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:36:07
Thanks. Will do. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 20:17:14
My 5 year theory...young adults start seeing bitcoin as a badass futuristic commodity. The lightbulb goes off in their heads during the next bull run (like it happened to me in 2013).
It becomes an affluent thing to own. People clamor to own 1 BTC. Price heads to $10k.  
@_date: 2016-07-31 13:38:35
is breadwallet integration safe with this?
@_date: 2015-02-25 01:50:55
Well right now the general pop thinks bitcoin is used by smelly devs and criminals. 
People need to see someone they think is cool using it for it to become popular. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 22:42:42
Well said sir
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:58:16
I like this a lot. Make bitcoin cool. 
Had a friend who worked at theaudience. They are really good at what they do. 
Pitbull is a client there. Look at his social media following. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:40:45
I also think another bubble would get them interested as well
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:59:32
Lol my names wyatt so I find that hilarious
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:27:42
For the greater good
@_date: 2015-03-12 10:58:24
Thanks a lot. Im very impressed with your response and sorry to not have waited longer. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 02:57:07
I have a feeling the seeds are planted and the next bubble the lights will go off in there heads and they'll finally look into on there own
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:43:45
Makes me hopeful. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 14:57:49
Right, so I dislike this implementation of fiat
@_date: 2015-02-17 17:49:57
Need these answers haha. I do like the idea of a fair bitcoin lottery thought. Godspeed. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 02:24:52
Godamn bitcoin is full of angry angry people
@_date: 2015-02-12 14:55:49

@_date: 2015-02-11 02:02:51
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:43:27
Haha that's great
@_date: 2015-02-17 23:38:52
Hahaha damn. Wonder what sorta mind it takes for that to happen
@_date: 2015-02-21 23:48:34
What's that
@_date: 2016-07-30 11:55:56
@_date: 2015-02-22 02:57:39
Might do it for bets
@_date: 2015-02-16 09:54:15
Those suck
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:23:17
I constantly have dreams that the price goes really low and can't login to Coinbase to buy or that the price goes really high and can't login to just to see my holdings value haha
@_date: 2015-02-27 00:43:09
I want to believe you, I really do...
@_date: 2015-02-21 23:58:32
So with those types I found them reacting exactly as you say. We always talk about stocks, ETFs, the markets so every now and then I'd bring up recent big bitcoin news. Then, one day about a month ago (I'd been talking to these select few about it since fall 2011) they all snapped around the same time and said something to the tune of "dude, stop talking about bitcoin. I don't care." 
Why are they so quick to invest in a piece of shit penny stock but won't even look at bitcoin. Blows my mind. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 15:55:32
I submitted a customer service request and never heard back from them. Sad! Moving all my coins out. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 02:49:03
Thanks in DC though
@_date: 2015-02-23 11:10:11
Interesting, I had no idea we could do that. It's software, written in code so I guess its possible. Very cool. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:34:40
Yes, the thinking too much on the price is right on point with many people too. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:44:29
Yea true. First I heard about it and I brushed it off too. Not for long though...
@_date: 2015-02-24 01:59:21
Worked well for me. Don't forget to download the source and generate offline!
@_date: 2016-07-31 13:35:51
is there a golf course?
@_date: 2016-07-31 13:36:36
same here. love the design but right now I have nothing to sell with it
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:24:57
Gotta laminate 
@_date: 2015-02-15 21:29:43
Sounded more like a pussyboy crying but ok
@_date: 2015-02-22 04:11:14
This is money thanks
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:46:15
Showed some the Brian Williams meme. They enjoyed that. Also, we have a redneck friend. He asked me about bitcoin (shockingly) the other day. Texted one friend saying "X just asked me about bitcoin. I think that means the next bull run is upon us."
@_date: 2015-02-26 02:43:13
Jesus. Relax hombre
@_date: 2015-02-21 23:48:26
Haha DM me 
@_date: 2015-02-24 21:01:43
No. They take a much more professional strategy. Organic growth, no fake likes. 
They will have their clients subtly mention bitcoin. Could be anything from a paper wallet located in a picture (but not mentioned) to someone tweeting they just bought a bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 23:47:53
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:47:50
Hahaha maybe I'll see her on tinder 
@_date: 2016-07-26 00:04:24
Ahhh that's all you gotta do to increase your fee?Nice! Gonna keep these instructions in case it happens to me. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 15:48:08
thanks
