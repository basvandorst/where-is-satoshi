24 hours? This isn't dialup days, cable/DSL/fiber are all dynamic, but generally hold their IP for months at a time.
I should rephrase that, the lease may be for 24 hours, but since the modem is on 24/7 it never gets a new IP.
@_date: 2014-08-11 14:35:31
Yeah, which is good and now maybe they will increase the block size limit and then it actually might become a more of an issue. Personally I still don't think it will be an issue for quite some time even if we up the block limit.

Didn't know that, thanks.
@_date: 2014-12-21 18:27:36
Which is misleading, part of the process to generate a public key is to use RIPEMD160 so that automatically reduces it to 160bit keys. Meaning yes you can have public key collisions with different private keys and both could spend the coins. Though 160bit is still crazy high.
Also I seem to recall something else was done that lowers the strength some more, but I can't remember.

Well so far the best store bought jerky I have found is from The Jerky Outlet, which they charge 8.5$/.25lb to 27$/lb. I'm not really sure what I would consider fair, but I guess to at least try it I would pay up to 12$/.25lb, but that includes shipping. For that kind of price though I would expect it to be quite good and to offer cheaper prices for larger amounts.

I know in windows you could always go to task manager and right click the process and lower its priority to Low. Then it would only ever get leftover CPU resources. Though it sounds like something is wrong as I can do a entire re-download in around half a day with just an i5 3570k.
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:10:55
You can pay whatever fee you want. Lower REQUIRED fee is good because if the blocks get full the market can figure out fair fees as people start increasing fees to make it into blocks.

Yeah, the miners decide which transactions to include so generally if there are too many they would just include the ones that give them the most transaction fees or that have higher priority.

From what I understand the problem with distributing blk files is the client won't auto verify those where the bootstrap is verified by the client. So the blk files could be malicious where its not possible with the bootstrap.

Java is just fine for local applications. I personally find it quite useful for a few things, but I do agree it should never be used for public sites. Also there are plenty of business applications that use Java and require the plugin.

@_date: 2014-10-08 19:06:07
The individual fees wouldn't, but you allow more transactions per block so in theory you could get more total transactions in a block that include a fee.
That would only matter if each block was full and everybody was using fees though.

No, it's just a random valid address that nobody knows the private key to.

Are you sure they are downloading for every email, even invalid ones? I would assume invalid emails are just dropped with no bounce-back. It wouldn't make sense to be storing content for billions of invalid emails. Which means that yes it is still a valid way to determine valid emails.

I think credit cards make the most sense. I have a single small plastic card that I can use to pay for everything. Never have to worry about so called "gnarly old $20s" or annoying coins. Never required to go to an ATM or bank to get money out. It is generally quicker as you can actually swipe the card as your items are being rung up so it only takes a couple seconds for it to confirm after the cashier is done.
@_date: 2014-10-23 21:13:57
You sure they would require injecting code to capture it? I'm not familiar with how exit nodes work, but if the connection is unencrypted then any packet sniffer between the user and end server in theory should be able to capture the submitted forms, which would include username/password.

He said 2^128, nothing about brute forcing the keys. Also you do know bitcoin addresses actually only have 2^160 bit keys as RIPEMD is used for the public key conversion process which lowers the security, though still a crazy high number.
@_date: 2014-08-15 18:20:28
I know, but unless you get the entire population to stop using credit cards all at once then there isn't any point in only some people stopping. Which people aren't going to stop unless there is something better or you give them a good discount for using something else.
My argument wasn't that credit cards were better than btc, just better than cash. So again I think credit cards are the best option currently for the average person.
@_date: 2014-08-10 23:11:04
Except there is a 1MB hard limit to block size so it is physically impossible for it to grow exponentially.
1MB\*(6 per hour)\*(24 hours per day)\*365=~51.3GB a year. I think its safe to say it can't out pace HDD currently. Personally I think internet speeds is more of an issue as you can easily add more disk space, but internet speeds are harder to increase.
@_date: 2014-11-17 22:11:45
There was a thread on bitcointalk a while back of people posting amounts they knew they lost. So while his addresses are a good start there are still plenty of known lost coins.

Currently, yes. Though there are of course plans to eventually increase the limit, but no time frame on when that will happen. My point still stands that currently it can't grow exponentially and we don't know when it will even be possible.
takenokokoko was complaining that people like to just ignore the issue and there is good reason to ignore it, because its not an issue currently.

Actually just one light minute would make your miner have a major disadvantage. Even right now miners (more like pools) are concerned about the block size getting too large because then it would take too long to transmit across the network so somebody else might just use a smaller blocksize and transmit to more of the network before you do making your work invalid.
@_date: 2014-02-15 20:59:07
You sure? I have never heard of that and it's not mentioned anywhere in utorrent UI nor does googling come up with anything.

Logically for it to be useful on a global level it would require it to be worth far more then it is now. Otherwise businesses doing millions in transactions a day would fluctuate the price too much.

It just says address owned by the original sender, not specifically the original address. So I would read it as long as I own a new different address I could use it to withdraw?

I don't see why it will disappear all together, but it for sure will be 50-75% of what it is now. Instead of it pulling from the current fund it will just be working people paying into it will be going directly split up to people pulling from it. So it will depend on how much people are paying into it in 30+ years.
@_date: 2014-05-01 13:48:07
So if the receiver has to scan all addresses for OP_RETURN and then attempt to decode them all doesn't that mean if people start using it a lot it will require quite a bit of work on the receivers end?

@_date: 2014-08-11 13:28:38
Yes I understand that, my point is that it isn't currently a major issue that some people like to think it is. The bigger issue is block prorogation, with bigger block sizes comes more to transfer, which when there is a race to solve the block before others that can make a difference. If two people solve the block withing milliseconds of each other, but one person solved it and included 500kb block size and the other 3MB then most likely the person that did 500kb will win because his can propagate to more nodes faster.

You could sit there on a supercomputer generating addresses for years and never come across one that has anything in it. Plus not only would you have to generate it, but also check it against the currently millions of used addresses in the block chain. Even then you might get one that has nothing.
Then again you could be the luckiest person in the world and happen to generate the one with that 400k coins in it just from starting the bitcoin client for the first time, but yeah good luck with that.

Either-way even decades from now a collision is so improbable.

That's actually good. You aren't taxed on how much you currently have, but how much you made. So in realhuman's example, a public address that all your income is sent to would be very easy to see all money you made/receive, but not how much you currently have.

I have no idea really, I am not a programmer or even a security expert. I think the reason they do the ripemd is so the public key is smaller, but according to that site I linked it goes thorough many hashings which I agree doesn't make sense, to me at least.

Spending from two actually should be fine as long as you aren't spending from both at the same time. If you spend from one and let the transaction confirm then the other wallet should pick it up and adjust itself accordingly. That way you are only spending the coins you have.
@_date: 2012-04-10 18:18:20
So if I understand this correctly when you loose, you still get half of your bid back?

Well pirate is saying he is controlling the market. From what I understand it sounds like he puts in a large order and buys all coins from 8-8.5 which causes everybody else to panic buy making it go up to 9.5. Then he sells them all for 8.5 which causes panic selling and he makes money. Not sure if that's correct or not.

It has been covered many times and is in the wiki, but the fees are paid to the miners. Whoever discovers the block gets all the fees for the transactions that's included in that block. When blocks start dropping in how much they give (2014 or something they are halving to 25 coins per block) then fees will become more important or if volume massively increases because higher fee = higher priority.
@_date: 2011-10-31 18:02:10

My point was as jdkeith was saying if you have 10BTC but really one 3.3 one 5.2 and one 1.5 coin there isn't anyway for a user to know this, at least I didn't see a way in the client. I understand how to send coins using the client is stupid easy. I do realize you could just make a new address if you really wanted to and send all your coins to it to recombine them all if needed.

Ah I was thinking AES256. Anyways by default truecrypt doesn't use NTFS unless you make it a massive container which wouldn't make sense for bitcoin. It would default to FAT then which as I said earlier has been around forever and isn't going anywhere anytime soon, but if you are that paranoid about the most widely supported file system then that's your problem.
@_date: 2011-07-08 13:22:38
Well I don't remember the in depth article I read awhile ago about it, but it basically said that while technically possible it would take many months or years to maybe recover kilobytes of data. Even then that data more than likely won't be continuous so it will just be fragments of files.
@_date: 2011-06-13 18:16:35
Are you saying because your Truecrypt container uses say FAT32 as the file system years down the road it may be difficult to recover it? That's the dumbest thing I have read today. Even today windows 7 can read FAT16 which was made in 1984. FAT32 is still wildly used for compatibility reasons between OS's and isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Even then I would hope you aren't using the same container for 15+ years for other reasons besides the file system. 
Now I am not saying I personally think Truecrypt is the best way to go. I find just using 7zip with SHA256 encryption quick, easy and more widely supported then Truecrypt.

Do botnets VNC to the computers? I didn't think so. I though it was just basically a background process telling the computer to do tasks and just talked to a server for what to do.

I am a little confused about that. It works off of public and private keys and your private key allows you to spend the coins, but why do you need a new key each time you receive coins? Also how does it know which 100 keys to make?
@_date: 2011-07-21 18:00:16
Yeah the reason I thought it was weird at first was because it had looked like they weren't spending anything and only changing the address a bunch. But I think I might have been looking at it wrong when I first noticed it. Still weird they have spent 6k+ coins in 30-50 coin increments.

I know on windows that there is a log that Bitcoin creates while updating the block chain. It only deletes said logs (all but most recent one) once you close the client so if you are starting the client up for the first time you will get like a gig alone of logs that will all but one be deleted once you close the client.

While the host does have full access to the disk image, it doesn't automatically mean it has full access to straight view the disk contents. First if the disk is encrypted it wouldn't be able to read it. Which that alone is not security through obscurity and wouldn't require more work for the user. Then if the VM is on that doesn't automatically give the host full access to the VM. It also depends on the type of VM software you are using determines how much they are isolated between each other. So having a VM for your wallet can easily be very secure and not through obscurity.

While I understand what you are saying and it is a good point it is also a bit different having people sign up for an account just to read something as apposed to going out and buying something. Yes PayPal does make this easier for the customer, but so does Google and Amazon if more places accept them. The risk has become so high for the merchant that I would really consider against using PayPal. This article is just proof of that and there are countless others all across the internet.

Ha no I actually went on blockexplorer for the first time the other day to just look around at it and noticed one transaction had a Total BTC of a couple hundred thousand compared to the normal couple thousand or less and was like WTF. So I looked at it and noticed somebody with 34k'ish coins was just making a dozen address changes. I checked again today and noticed they at times leave little chunks behind at said random address changes.
@_date: 2011-06-01 18:53:21
I first started up client and got address xxx. I went to the facet and got .02btc sent to xxx then days later I noticed I had address yyy. Now I had been in a mining pool and did the receive payment to xxx and then noticed I have yet an other new address www and I know I didn't click generate new address and all transactions have been done with address xxx. 
@_date: 2011-07-21 14:39:53

I think its a great idea and I agree you do have to consider stupid people when developing, but this isn't an enforced feature. The user has to knowingly enable this and it even gives a bunch of warnings. I really don't know what else they could do. If you have any better ideas please do share.
As far as trojans I think you are referring to keyloggers. There isn't anything you can really do to prevent that. Not even normal banks can protect against a keylogger with one exception. If they have some onscreen keyboard that's randomized that you have to click to enter your password.
@_date: 2011-06-01 20:23:17

Your coins would still be fine and your node would actually work until it got a block over the current limit. It would drop that block and from then on you wouldn't be sync'ed with the rest of the network. This is basically what a hardfork is, two different blockchains. Though normally miners update so they don't keep updating the "old" chain.
Now if you tried spending your coins while not on the correct chain, I'm not sure how your node and the other nodes would handle that. Either your node doesn't broadcast it properly because it's not synced properly so nothing happens. Or your node broadcasts it, but the main nodes just ignores it for various reasons. Or it broadcasts it and both nodes think its valid and it does move the coins both blockchains.
This all assumes your wallet client is connecting to that node. Eitherway nothing happens to the coins themselves, it just may cause problems when trying to send or receive coins, but they aren't lost, your client just can't "see" them.
It really has worse problems for pools as they might be working on the old bad chain and not trying to get the block reward.

And where did you get 2 5870's for 300$? New they run about 300 each even for used that's cheap especially considering they are still high end cards. 
Edit: I was thinking new hardware. If you got a bunch of great used cheap hardware then you more then likely could make some money. You also need to consider the cost of electricity for all the hardware and all the heat it generates which rises cooling costs for your house. Hardware is only party of the cost.

We actually won't ever hit 21m on the dot. Adding more decimal places will actually just increase the amount of repeating 9's so it will actually cause the mining reward to continue.

A normal consumer probably wouldn't unless there is an incentive to do so such as a discount. With no charge-backs it has less of a cost to accept bitcoin than credit cards so places could offer a slight discount for it to entice consumers to use bitcoin.
Though credit cards normally offer cash-back so it would have to compete with that.
The idea is if everybody accepts bitcoin then the business wouldn't need to convert it back to cash and could just use the bitcoin itself to pay for supplies, but we are a ways away from that happening so this is just like the stepping stone.
I think it's great more for online purchases where you can't use cash and there is high credit fraud.

I thought the whole drive is encrypted using the master key which is encrypted using your password. With the master key being some 256 or 512 bit key, not sure, but something large. That is why when you change your TC password it only takes seconds as it just re-encrypts your master key with the new password. So the randomness is only for the master key. Or so I thought.

Little late response? As far as MtGox goes it is the cheapest one of them all. Using Dwolla it only costs a flat 25 cents total for getting money into Gox. That's for if you are doing 10$ or 10000$ so it's by far the cheapest way, but it's not fast.

I think there is a big difference between gambling with even a 10% chance of winning and gambling with trying to win a block solo. Considering it would take between ~545 years to ~9100 years depending on your processor which if my math comes out right is about between ~0.0000000349% and ~0.00000000209% chance of winning 1/(545*365*24*6). So yeah not even comparable.

I personally don't think it's best to limit things, but I do agree blockchain spam is/will be an issue and this seems like a simple way to help alleviate it. My question is why are you so upset about restricting fraction of a cent transactions? Not like you can buy anything with near nothing.
Plus it has been stated countless times, bitcoin is not designed as a micro transaction system. If you want to send a bunch of penny's to different people then make something like the bitcointipbot. Also you could just wait till you want to send 5 penny's and send them all at once, which will work even after the change.

The IRS would still know about 2 $9900 transfers. Anything suspicious is reported and two large exactly the same amounts that are just below the limit are very suspicious.

As sirkent mentioned, this has nothing to do with SD and everything to do with higher fee transactions. SD actually does include a fee. Plenty of other normal transactions don't include a fee.

I have been trying to figure this out for a couple weeks as well. I am confused about a few things. The first being if you look on  and take their 65 byte key from

"600FFE422B4E00731A59557A5CCA46CC183944191006324A447BDB2D98D4B408". Instead I get
which I verified is correct using  So what is so different about their sha256 then normal ones?
@_date: 2013-03-03 16:08:02
Ok that may work. Though if you do this frequently I wouldn't be surprised if ebay catches you.
@_date: 2013-08-22 00:15:52
I'm not sure about the details on how PGP sig works, but I think it works by person A checksuming the message and then encrypting the checksum with their priv key. Then to verify the message hasn't been tampered with person B takes the public key from person A to decrypt the sig and gets the checksum and compares it with the provided checksum. At least thats what I recall reading years ago.

Separate admin account is always better security, but UAC does provide some protection.
Simple example is malware with UAC enabled can't affect any system files, only yours. Unless you just blindly allow everything to run as admin, which is a user issue and not OS.

Or there is a python script to delete the transactions out of your wallet and then rescan the blockchain so you are able to respend it. This is assume default client.

Any decent brand MLC, Samsung/Intel. Samsung is rated at 3000 writes which at 120GB is ~350TB = ~98GB/day for 10 years.
Even the cheaper TLC Samsungs are good for around 1000 writes which is still a ton of writes and would be more than enough for any consumer grade desktop.

You could just extract the private keys from all the old wallets and only keep those. Then you can import them to whatever wallet.

While the SSD helped a lot of that wasn't just SSD. I know that seems ridiculously fast so I just created a 10GB RAM drive and started it over. It has been over an hour and I still have over 49k blocks left to go. Also I was monitoring my speeds during it and it was only pulling around 450-900KBs which is well below my max and my CPU usage never went above 40% so that doesn't seem to be the issue either. I don't know how you could possibly get it in 17 mins even with gig speeds unless you were pulling the data from some server directly and had it running on a server.
@_date: 2013-10-26 18:18:25
Miners can never STOP mining. Otherwise transactions wouldn't ever confirm. I never did say they needed to start or stop, just that they would again generating coins aka block rewards.

@_date: 2013-02-08 17:53:17
Last I checked that wouldn't do anything. Your wallet is the thing that caches transactions. So you would need to delete all transactions, not the keys, from you wallet and tell the client to do a rescan.

That is bad they even allow http for that. Also it's kinda obvious blockchain will have your private key. I wouldn't trust them for anything more than a little spending money, but they are good for that. No idea the purpose for this api call, but I'd assume it's for things like that.

I am no expert, but I have heard it argued that the faster blocks doesn't provide any more security. As comparatively its about the same to mine 4 2.5min blocks as it 1 10min block as the difficulty is lower for the faster blocks. Therefor 2 2.5min blocks are less secure then 1 10min block.

You know bitcoin private keys only have 160 bits of entropy so even if your phrase is 256 wouldn't it be reduced to 160 bits because of the RIPEMD-160 being used in the private key algorithm?

I am not the one with the problem, but thanks. Anyways if you are using the default client and sent coins then resetting the blockchain I don't think is going to help as your wallet saves the transactions. There are ways to clear the transactions out of your wallet though.

Actually the year isn't set in stone and it has already moved forward from the drastic increase in hasing rate over the last couple months. It of course will level off, but that doesn't change the fact we are ahead of schedule.
Anyways yes the cap is 21 million, but we will never reach that specific number because forever halving something means you are just shifting the decimal forever more to the right.






So yes if we did increase the decimals we would again start to get block rewards.

Doesn't require nearly as high as 2^256, 
@_date: 2013-09-03 23:04:41
Except part of the public key process is RIPEMD160 making the search space no more than 2^160, which I have been told it's even lower for some reason I can't remember. Still crazy large number though.
Yes this does mean there are multiple cases of different private sha256 keys that = the same public key and either would allow spending of coins.
@_date: 2013-08-15 02:59:41
Ah sorry you are right, I was thinking 10mbtc.

Ha that was a lot more than 10 replies.
@_date: 2013-10-26 16:47:50
Well technically it's not zero, it's just a lower number then the current 8 decimals allow. So if that was increased then mining would again start generating coins.
@_date: 2013-03-09 18:15:26
Oh I agree there are better ways to store a password than SHA, but still SHA3 vs 2 isn't going to be better really. Also if you are salting your password and only have 12 character long password it would take over 100 years to brute force that if you are getting 1 billion hashs per second. So yeah I'd say a decent password is still secure with SHA2+salt.

It has been a while since I last did it, but I used jackjack's version of pywallet  it allows dumping of the QT client wallet file. You will need python, but only need the Twisted and Zope.Interface if you plan on running the web interface. For dumping the wallet you really don't need that, just install python. Once you have it installed open a new command prompt in the directory where the pywallet.py is and run "pywallet.py --dumpwallet &gt; C:\Users\[user]\Desktop\wallet.txt" and make sure you edit the C:\ path to either your desktop or wherever you want it. Then you can open the txt file and it should have all the private keys and associated public keys.

Actually there is only 2^160 public keys because part of the public key process is ripemd160.

Doesn't work that way. If the customer sent 1btc from address 1a to address 1b to pay for an item, but also did a double spend with high fee to 1c.

Also you can significantly help speed up the initial download by downloading the bootstrap.dat and put it in %AppData%\Bitcoin.

Also other good thing about it is then you aren't downloading all those transactions from the bitcoin network to help reduce traffic.
As others have said if you don't have more than 8 connections then you aren't helping as it means you don't have port 8333 opened to your computer so you aren't actually allowing incoming nodes. Which is the whole point of this thread.
