Check out  ;)
@_date: 2014-07-29 16:07:03
Thank you ;)
@_date: 2014-07-29 16:11:04


Why? strip4bit don't need one and don't use bitpay.
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:48:38
shameless self post, but try strip4bit.com if you seek for girls who are actually online.
and for gods sake, pls add NSFW to this! Just surfed to this site at my office :P
@_date: 2014-08-20 07:26:35
Not a single satoshi ;)
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:22:49
Nice copy of  - Same girls, same login mechanism, same framework. Just a little bit more expensive :P
@_date: 2014-10-25 11:04:27
Try my site   
You can start with only 2 USD if you are afraid of scam. It's so easy to accept micro transactions with Bitcoin &lt;3 
@_date: 2014-09-08 11:01:54
Also missing strip4bit.com 
I have a big list somewhere with many more adult pages, i search it tomorrow. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 18:43:38
Really nice! But wow is their signup process complicated compared to  - New with super easy TREZOR login!
@_date: 2014-10-25 16:34:46
Thank you.   
I don't get the business concepts of these scamming/rebilling porn sites. Make your service good to the customer and your fine. Try to rip them off and your business ship will sink soon. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:26:08
This is a brilliant piece of technology!  
I've seen this before and think about of integrating it on 
@_date: 2015-05-07 16:28:27
wb :D
@_date: 2015-05-19 18:49:25
You can "charge back" your credit card... up to... let me lie... 6 months? So you pay with it, they pay the models and then you call your bank and say "nono, I want my money back". Then they have to send you encashment letters etc. Often this happens with &lt;50 Bucks and they never see their money back. Going to court isn't worth this smaller amounts.
Strip4bit don't use a "payment processor". All you have to do is generate private keys... Even no need for Gear.
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:22:13
Thanks for the tips but that are things I can't really change... Maybe the 2. thing I can.. Let me think about it...  
Have you compared the prices with other private chat pages?  
chaturbate HAD bitcoins around 1 year ago and removed it. Dunno why... :/
@_date: 2016-06-20 09:23:08
 - active since 3 years and I cannot recommend Bitcoin for porn any more. :D
@_date: 2016-02-02 17:10:08
@_date: 2016-02-02 17:22:02
We should stick our heads together and build a real decentralized p2p cam platform where every viewer also uses his upstream. :) 
@_date: 2016-02-08 19:26:56
Bitcoin if the site is not using recurrent models.
@_date: 2017-04-17 06:44:17
Strip4bit.com also only accepts Bitcoin and don't convert everything to Fiat like chaturbate. :) 
@_date: 2015-09-07 23:18:32
Yep! Most of my old BTC bookmarks are down. But porn and BTC seem to be a good combination :)
@_date: 2015-09-07 23:14:02
That's just a copy of

@_date: 2015-09-07 23:15:45
What would be the difference from a normal "tip more" button like you do in a strip club with your dollar notes?
@_date: 2015-09-08 10:41:24
Trust me, I would love to see that the models get bitcoins, but someone has to start it and has to show them how it works. I also would love to see more revenue for the models, but also xotika writes:




50% is a lesser extend then they get on our "affiliate and scam sites"...
@_date: 2015-09-07 00:02:38
 - still alive and one of the first in the market! 
@_date: 2015-10-13 06:33:46
you then should support us also ;) You pants will love the webcam girls on 
@_date: 2016-07-26 12:50:15
Use it on 
@_date: 2013-09-13 16:13:06
I tried a-ads it several times to advertise with my NSFW site. Never made a single satoshi from all the visits. But the visits come and i paid for them. My ads are rated to "Ad rating: NSFW". Should be no problem for your site.
@_date: 2013-03-30 17:52:58


But in reality 
 its 0: sketchy
@_date: 2013-02-21 21:01:01
You have to be creative when you meet girls who do nearly everything for you ;) Some time ago i had a bet with someone, that i find a girl who puts one hand at her breast and shows the Vulcan salute with the other hand. Took me some time to find her, but she did it ;)
About your "video + text chat only". Not every girl sends audio. I should implement that little icons and infos what they technical can do. (cam2cam, hd, sound)
@_date: 2013-02-21 18:44:46
@_date: 2013-02-21 15:46:49
True words. I even don't understand why they all want to have email addresses... But you don't imagine HOW MANY ppl insert their credit card into repeating subscriptions sites. That's one of the main reasons why i had to quit this job. All that "paid for the next year and get nothing"-sites are just a pain.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:23:28
@_date: 2013-03-01 00:35:07
nah. fiat-payment sucks. you have around 20-40% chargeback if you accept creditcards. paypal and co don't allow porn. it's all to difficult, not anonymous, you have to pay 10-20% "payment costs"... Porn = Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:00:16
here you go: 
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:29:09
try scanbook (also for apple) 
@_date: 2013-09-16 22:34:41
If you have good Bitcoin traffic, you can give it a try and send some here: 
@_date: 2013-09-16 22:39:51
and some of these gambling sites have much BTC to spend...
189BTC for 1 week advertisement. wow. he never will see a ROI on this.
@_date: 2013-09-16 22:17:37
Your mixes made me laugh ;) I'll give it a try. Advertising with Bitcoins on a-ads or coinurl sucks. You get some visitors, but most are from "get paid for" sites. Wasting BTC for my ads there boils down to the same thing as buying Bitcoin miners from BFL instead...
@_date: 2013-09-16 15:23:03
It's all about contacts :)
@_date: 2013-05-19 19:13:06
What offline wallet? Thought you want to spend it?
btw, porn here:  (and static content metartnetwork.com/bitcoin/ )
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:25:27
Maybe that's someones fetish?
@_date: 2013-09-16 16:18:25
Thank you. Should be fixed.
+0.05 BTC
@_date: 2013-09-16 22:33:27
pls send me a private message with her name and i look at it.
@_date: 2013-02-21 19:18:41
When you work 10 years for that industry you know how and which whom you play that game ;)
@_date: 2013-02-21 16:12:05
Good point. Hard to answer because i have to pay the girls and can't offer a free chat feature. But register and give me your (strip4bit-)address and ill send you 0.2 BTC to test ;)
@_date: 2013-09-16 19:58:29
The girls "generate" all their material "at home". No professionals involved. (Expect some photographs, hired by the girls)
Hosting is no problem today anymore. Just ask your desired search engine. There are also some nice Bitcoin hosters out there.
@_date: 2013-09-16 15:52:07
Thank you. I think more and more will come. Some of the bigger players are here already:
@_date: 2013-09-17 20:20:19
the simple answer. it's damn hard. the bitcoin ad places don't convert. bitcointalk is damn expensive and never will ROI for anybody expect scamers and the normal marketing places brings ppl who don't understand how to buy bitcoins. Maybe it's too early, but i'm here when it starts :)
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:48:45
also:  with lots more girls online
@_date: 2013-02-28 23:40:06
when i got traffic its was doing fine, but ffs all these bitcoin ad sites don't deliver much traffic. think the scene is just to small for such a project. everybody is just throwing his BTC to satoshidice or BFL...
@_date: 2013-02-21 19:15:41
I have to pay my content-partner, they have to pay the girls. And the girls want some value to do all the naughty thinks for you ;)
@_date: 2013-02-21 20:48:28
Maybe if it becomes more mainstream. But as today the industry say "nah, its to complicated and nobody will use it" and they mess around with 20-40% chargeback rates. SO stupid ;)
@_date: 2013-06-24 08:20:47
i've tested it: really nice site. Design and tech is a fine piece of work. fair games. payin and payout worked like a charm.
The only bug i found was in the account overview the csv Button.
@_date: 2013-09-16 20:36:10
And a little bit of jsfuck.com
@_date: 2013-06-09 16:53:05
It's the 4. or 5. of these things here. We need to make a case and setup this as an alarm clock beside our beds :)
@_date: 2013-04-19 12:57:56
Yep, thats the problem: You must have the plain address to copy and paste. You must have the bitcoin: and you must have the QRCode. And for all these, online wallets don't work.
@_date: 2013-09-18 20:17:28
They also appear on many other sites. Its a big Network.
@_date: 2013-09-17 21:32:24
you'r damn right. i just changed it. dunno what driven me to do it that simple. was the first thing i did. But the last chars are save. nobody know's the public addresses (yes, they are public, but how do you get them?). And most ppl don't pay that much and left it unchatted. that's the cool thing with bitcoins. you can only pay what you just use.
@_date: 2013-02-21 20:55:26
Yep, it checks the price frequent because i'm forced to pay for the girls. They need money for all their wired toys that real girls don't have ;) (Trust me: In all the years i've seen EVERYTHING!!!)
@_date: 2013-09-17 21:33:33
+bitcointip 0.02 BTC
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:59:24
Im sorry, but your site is scam. You are just sending Videos. I've even seen your videos at cam4btc.
@_date: 2013-09-16 17:02:45
Send me a PN.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:45:31
Yep, and everybody that looks at your public html code:
    //lets click that "private" button:
    if (document.getElementById("pvt").value=="Start Private")
    {
    var video = document.getElementById('cam');
    
    //lol just some random, no customer should notice it, cause we have 19 videos!
    var vidnum=getRandomInt(1,19);
    
    //here goes the LIVE stream!
    var pvtsrc='../images/Video/Playfulll69/1/'+vidnum+'.webm';
    video.setAttribute("src", pvtsrc);
    
    //BAM! We are live!
    video.play();
    var privateon = 1;
    
    //oops, fixed time out. sorry
    setTimeout(pvttime, 30000);
    return;
    }
pls do some real business or gtfo of Bitcoin. Your one of the persons ruining it!

@_date: 2013-09-16 14:51:29
It just feels good to do something you like. And Bitcoin + porn + being your own boss = priceless
In my life as a FIAT developer i implemented so many payment gateways and many of them didn't even make a ROI of my work, or charge-backed like hell. Eg. take direct debit for an online erotic projekt. Without difficult address protections you'll end up with 40% fraud.
Yes it was. You need some contacts to this business if you want to start a real project.
@_date: 2013-07-11 19:33:01
Canon 640d, sounds like scam to me :P
whould be one of the best stores out there if it's real.
@_date: 2013-09-16 15:31:42
Stolen credicards, stolen bank data, angry wife's or simply people who know, that none to speak of percent of companies bring a "small" charge backed transaction at law.
Bitcoin simply don't have that type of problem.
@_date: 2013-02-21 20:27:47
you've got mail.
@_date: 2013-02-28 23:49:37
no, and i don't want to. what would then the different to any of the other 50 cam porn sites be? :(
@_date: 2013-03-29 23:14:51
Sure i do :)
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:34:13
Some of the porn companys are already involved to Bitcoin: 
@_date: 2013-02-21 15:56:51
Yep. Private 1:1 show. Some girls even accept cam to cam.
@_date: 2013-09-16 22:18:47
You can look for a model you like and ask her in the chat if she can do this show for you. Isn't that what you think of?
@_date: 2013-05-19 19:39:52
"my Bitcoin" -&gt; Deposits/disbursements and then in the upper "Tab" DISBURSEMENT
there you can pay to thatever service or address you want to.
Maybe to your Wallet on your PC or to another online wallet or just use this as your online wallet.
@_date: 2013-03-29 22:45:18
I agree, but first i have to say: Live camgirls are different to "free porn"! ;)
But yes, i think too less really **spend** Bitcoins. When they do, they buy Avalon or Butterflylabs hardware or waste them at satoshidice. I think the time for bitcoin shops and service provider will get better when all the Miners are send out, the ppl cashed out their investment and the speculation bubble has popped. I'm ready for this time ;)
