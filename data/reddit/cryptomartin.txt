I‘ve seen so many of the „narrowing down pics“ in the past couple of months. This is like reading tea leaves, it doesn‘t mean much. BTC could go down to 5000 after this „narrowing“, or even into the 3000 range, before another bull run starts. The next bull run will probably start at the end of 2019, 3 to 4 months ahead of the next block reward halving,

Well, nobody knows for sure. But I think: we haven‘t broken through 8500 dollars, this is still a bear market and a bull trap / dead cat bounce. We will first go back down to 5000, then bear market will continue for months, and things will look better end of next year when the block reward halving comes closer. Just my opinion when I look at the numbers and charts.

@_date: 2018-09-02 14:39:00
Calm down and stop the namecalling. I wrote 5000, not 500. And I’ve been holding Bitcoin since 2013, I probably own a lot more than you. So if you can‘t deal with the fact that this might be a dead cat bounce and we may still in a bear market for a year, maybe call your mum or a psychotherapist.

Well, Bitcoin will do away with intermediaries such as PayPal.
But I won't shed a tear for Alex Jones. He is a religious nut, he spreads hate and misinformation. He harassed an innocent owner of a pizza restaurant with a ridiculous conspiracy theory. He is hurting parents whose children were murdered. He is a liar and a hatemonger. And PayPal, an American company, can freely chose who to do business with. Bitcoin doesn't need intermediaries, so there's an alternative, even for nutcases such as Jones.

The block size debate never was not only about block size, but about the security of a multi billion dollar network. A block size  increase can only be done via a hard fork (meaning an upgrade with software that makes old software incompatible). That’s risky and it can split the network. Therefore Bitcoin was first upgraded via Segwit, which could be implemented via a soft fork (meaning that old wallets stay compatible and there is no risk of a chain split). Segwit not only increased the space for more transactions per block but also fixed transaction malleability - in the safest way possible. Future increases of the block size (via a hard fork) may be necessary, but by scaling via a soft fork first, BTC prioritized safety of the network.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:32:11

Thanks. I hope it will work out for you, too. Not having to work for the groceries and the rent made me realize what I really want to do, and to be able to help others. My advice (if you want it) is to read a lot (instead of watching stupid shows) and of course to hodl for a few years. Or to say it in Andreas Antonopoulos' words: "Don't trade, learn". Reading and hodling is all I did really.

In China it is impossible to lead a medium sized or large company without interference by the Communist Party. Larger corporations even have to have CCP party officers in their management. You can take a guess now whether this applies to Bitmain the ASIC manufacturer. And then take another guess whether the recent actions of the PBOC towards exchanges are part of the Chinese government trying to get a grip on the wild and anarchistic Bitcoin network. "A well thought out, insidious and calculated actor" indeed.

In China, every company that's larger than a soup kitchen run by one person gets regular visits by CCP officials.

Trump will tank the economy, demolish the little freedom you still have left (for example by prohibiting end-to-end-encryption) and strenghten the religious nutcases in the Republican party. The fact that you are trying to insult me with the words "liberal fucks" says a lot about you. The latin word liberalis means freedom, which is obviously something you are against. 
I will consider Trump's presidency a success if he manages to not nuke the world within the next 4 years. Before his presidency even started, he already insulted the leadership of China, the EU and NATO. He doesn't know anything about diplomacy, economics or politics. Donald Trump is a fraud, an impostor, a con man and a wannabe dictator. Expect the worst from him.

I like it. Just one thing that could be better imho: The choice between "Bitcoin" and "Lightning" when creating a new wallet sounds wrong. For someone new to the space it could create the wrong impression that Bitcoin and Lightning were two different coins. A Lightning transaction is a Bitcoin transaction (based on state channels / smart contracts using multisig and nLock time.) I think the wording in the setup menu should be different, something like "Segwit HD wallet" and "Lightning wallet".
Other than that, this seems to be a cool app.
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:20:15
Lightning channels are based on smart contracts that use Bitcoin's multisig and timelock capabilities. So yes, they're good - for high transaction volume of small amounts, microtransactions etc.

@_date: 2017-08-06 12:43:28
The devs who created Segregated Witness never were against scaling on chain with bigger blocks *at some time in the future*. They were against rushed hard forks and prefered to do the Segwit soft fork *first*, because Segwit also optimizes block space and can be done with less risk than a hardfork. Bigger blocks can be done after that. But Roger Ver and the Unlimited camp started to sabotage Bitcoin with spam transactions to "prove" Bitcoin needed a risky hard fork right away. This stupid war Roger Ver and Unlimited started was completely unnecessary, as was the creation of the BCH alt.

Bitcoin is under attack by the BCH camp. They implemented a hack of the difficulty algorithm (EDA) in their altcoin blockchain which uses the same mining algo as Bitcoin to draw hashrate away from it.

Both the words liberal and liberty are rooted in the Latin word liberalis, wich means freedom. You obviously have no idea what the word liberal means, but you're against it. Well, you're wish is about to be granted. You are now getting someone for president who is anti encryption and pro surveillance, who admires violence and hates a free press. Someone who is against free trade agreenments and believes that mercantilism and import tolls will better the economy. Someone who wants to build walls. Someone who thinks he can "unite" America although his speeches are full of hate and discrimination.

Very low trading volume, impossible to get BTC out of ViaBTC at the moment, and a lot of price manipulation. People who want to dump BCH are not able to, because blocks are still being generated slowly. Value was not "created out of thin air", because liquidity matters. And due to Metcalfe's law, short to mid term the network effect of both BTC and BCH will be lower than Bitcoin's network effect was before.

You completely misunderstood my point. I was replying to a reditor who said that the USA don't need to be a democracy, just a republic. I explained that the word republic usually is used for a state with a government that excludes a monarch, and I said the US being a republic is not enough. You want to live in a democratic republic, meaning: no monarch, and fair elections. My negative example was China, which - like many other dictatorships - calls itself a republic, because it doesnt have a monarch, but does not offer democratic elections.

He asked why the U.S. can't use nuclear weapons. He is building a personality cult. He glorifies the past in the same way Mussolini glorified Ancient Rome and Hitler talked about building a new, third empire. He wants to prohibit end to end encryption, thus weakening privacy. He is pro torture. He  called the UN a club where people hang out and have a good time, which is very similiar to the things Hitler said about the German parliament before he came into power.

And how would someone obtain the private key of bitcoins stored on a Trezor? That's virtually impossible. There was a vulnerability of Trezor in the past where someone could obtain a Trezor, physically crack it open, hook up some electronics and pull the key from the device. It was very complicated, destroyed the plastic shell of the device, and the vulnerability was fixed with a firmware update. A thief can not get the private key. He can only try to get the seed, and that will be useless to him if you used passwords because of the previously mentioned reasons.

No, it will not have to. That‘s what second layer solutions are for. It‘s imposisble to scale Bitcoin to millions of transactions per second by increasing the block size, but it is possible with state channels and other second layer tech.

Blockstream is a company that mostly works on sidechain technologies. You can look them up on their website. 
One of the contributors to the Bitcoin Core wallet and node software  is Adam Back. He invented an important technology called Hashcash some years before Bitcoin was invented and is one of the few people who is mentioned in the original Bitcoin whitepaper of Satoshi Nakamoto. 
Adam Back is also the CEO of Blockstream. He thinks that Bitcoin needs to scale in the same way the internet does, with additional protocol layers (and sidechains). Therefore larger block are less important to him. That's the reason rbtc hates him and spreads lies about his company - most of the stories you'll read about Blockstream on rbtc are conspiracy theories of Flat Earth proportions. Here is a speech by Andreas Antonopoulos about scaling Bitcoin that I really like and recommend to watch:

No. One bitcoin equals 100 million satoshis. Every price lower than 100,000 dollars for that is still cheap. Adoption of Bitcoin is still far below 1%. The early adopter phase starts at 2.5% userbase, early mainstream starts at 10%. So you are very early if you start holding and using Bitcoin now - an innovator.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:10:03
Stop spreading nonsense about Bitcoin. Of course it is intended to be used for day to day transactions - that’s why the activation of Segwit was so important. Because that gives Bitcoin state channel networks such as Lightning, Rootstock and other sidechains etc. These technologies are for microtransactions - many more transactions than Bcash could handle. Bitcoin will be the backbone of the internet of money and enable millions of transactions per second. Bcash will be an altcoin that doesnt even have a malleability fix, so it can‘t do any of those things. The divide is caused by con men, fraudsters and their propaganda against Bitcoin.

As I already explained, a Trezor password is an additional element of an entirely new 25 word seed, therefore it creates new private keys, so the private keys of the 24 seed do not work for the password protected coins. A stolen 24 word seed is entirely useless for a thief if it has password protected coins on it, because the password is part of a new seed and generates different keys.

@_date: 2017-11-05 07:46:23
Sure. When you send a Bitcoin transaction, you can add a little fee so the transaction gets included into a block faster.
You can still send transactions without fees, but then they will take longer to confirm,
Some wallets set the fees automatically, but I don‘t recommend that.
In the future, we will do most smaller payments / microtransactions via second layer protocols such as Lightning, so they will be free.

@_date: 2017-11-19 12:27:23
Sorry, baffling you was not my intention.
Do you know how hierarchical deterministic bitcoin wallets („HD wallets“) work?
(For example Mycelium, Greenaddress, Bread or Trezor and Ledger). They give you a seed, which is a list of 12 or 24 words. That seed is the basis for the generation of private and public key which are related to each other. All private keys made by that seed contain the same bitcoins - the keys can be determined based on the cryptographic hierarchy, hence HD. If you change the seed by adding another word (the „password“) you get an entirely new set of keys.
So you can literally have dozens, thousands or even millions of bitcoin wallets on one Trezor. A thief who obtains the original 24 word seed can only access one of these wallets - the one that doesnt have a „password“, because that seed can only generate the private kes for that one unencrypted wallet.
Is that any clearer?
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:30:43
Bitcoin is still under attack by the mining cartel that pushes BCH. They are sending thousands of spam transactions in the BTC blockchain. Be patient - if you don‘t have to do this transaction now wait for a few days.
Also: Jaxx is handy when you want to use different coins, but its inflexible with the fees - better use wallets that allow you to set the fee yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:23:12
Whales such as Roger &amp; Co. have millions in fiat, bitcoin and altcoins. So, yes, they can do a lot of fake trading with each other on an exchange such as Bithumb (no fees) and pump up the prices. Of course they will lose bitcoins while doing so, too, because other people will dump their Bcash on them. Serves them right though. And the pump will be over very fast.

Yes, the split between the Bitcoin and the BCH camps is definetely not a good thing. It's a fact that mining has become more centralized because of ASIC farms. And imho it's a conspiracy that Blockstream somehow controls development. Bitcoin is an open source project on Github with more than a hundred contributors from all over the world. Consensus to change the rules of Bitcoin can neither be reached by miners alone, nor by developers alone. Consensus must always be reached by developers, miners, wallet providers, exchanges and merchants together.

@_date: 2017-11-02 23:29:15
Never. When the subsidized block reward is down to 1 satoshi (0.00000001 BTC), it's trivial to add some additional digits, so for example we could have a block reward of half a satoshi (0.000000005 BTC), too. That won't happen before the year 2140 though anyway. And miners also get transaction fees, which at one point in time will be higher than the subsidized block reward. So for these two reasons, mining can go forever.

It‘s an altcoin whose creators deleted the Segregated Witness code (which enables 2nd layer networks and fixes transaction malleability). They removed this code in a pretty amateurish way even. Furthermore, Bitcoin Cash has a so called „Emergency Difficulty Algorithm“, which is broken and allows miners to game the block times for higher rewards. Avoid Bitcoin Cash.

My portfolio is 40% BTC, 40% ETH and 20% other alts (LTC, VTC, DASH, XMR etc.). Stay away from BCH (Bcash, fake Bitcoin). Do your own research. Don't invest in anything you don't understand. Don't leave coins on exchanges or in web wallets you don't have the private keys for, always store coins in wallets where you own the private keys yourself. And don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
Good luck and welcome to cryptocurrency!

I use an Oculus Rift at home (with 3 sensors and Touch controllers, so full roomscale), and a Vive at the office (roomscale, too, of course).
I prefer the Oculus Rift for its better comfort and lighter weight. The Oculus Touch controllers are better than the Vive wands, too.
But they're both amazing headsets.
I don't follow the BTC price in VR :)  But there is a neat little Bitcoin game on Steam, where you can watch the blockchain in VR and shoot arrows at transactions. It's called BitcoinVR and works with both the Rift and the Vive.

Miners are less powerful than you think. They provide a service and get paid for it. Consensus for changes of the Bitcoin protocol always needs to be established between five groups: miners, developers, exchanges, merchants and wallet providers. Miners have huge electricity costs, sometimes paid upfront for months or even a year - they need to sell bitcoins and therefore follow the market.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:29:21
It's one of the worst shitcoins on the market, so it's perfectly fine to sell it. If you need a hedge, get any other altcoin but Btrash.

For each block miners find they get both transaction fees and a subsidized block reward. Currently, the subsidized block reward is 12.5 BTC per block. This halves every four years. In the year 2140 the block reward will be down to 1 satoshi (0.00000001 BTC), however the transaction fees will be a lot more. It would also be trivial to use more subunits, so the subsidized block reward could be half a satoshi (0.000000005 BTC). So there is no need to worry, mining can go on after 2140 and stay profitable. Be sure to live healthy so you will still be around!

The subsidized block reward goes down to 1 satoshi (one hundred millionth of a bitcoin) in the year 2140. However, miners also get transaction fees. Furthermore, it‘s trivial to implement fractions of a satoshi as a subsidized block reward. Your grandchildren will figure it out.

Be aware that Bitcoin is under attack by Chinese miners who are spamming the blockchain + diverting hashrate away from BTC towards BCH by pumping its price with bots on Bithumb.

No, they can‘t. A Trezor password is a 25th word of your seed, so it generates completly different privat keys. And you can use as many passwords as you want. That‘s the beauty of Trezor really. Just dont ever forget a password - there is no way to recover it, because it‘s not stored anywhere.

It's funny though, in the past 24 hours Bitcoin did 2256.66 transactions, while Bcash did 105.46 transactions (source:  ). Isn't it a bit useless then to say "BCH is faster", with such a small number of people actually using it for transactions? The BCH blockchain does not need to scale yet, because it's still empty. And the main reason the price is rising at the moment is that Roger Ver and friends are trading back and forth between themselves on a single Korean exchange without fees. Classic pump'n'dump movement in the next 2 or 3 days, if you ask me.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:00:17

It was a good idea. Bitcoin was (and still is) under attack these days. The attackers were sending tons of spam transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain while at the same time pumping the price of Bcash and diverting hashrate away from Bitcoin. At the same time they also published a series of propaganda articles to push their narrative that Bitcoin is too slow and Bcash is "the real Bitcoin". Some people fell for it and gave away their BTC for BCH. Be careful out there. You did the right thing by buying more BTC. Now don't let scammers and altcoin shills take them away from you. HODL.

You set up a new Trezor with a 24 word seed originally. Later you can encrypt it and use passwords (additional 25th word) as many times as you want. There is no limit to the number of passwords, so you can set up a fake password protected wallet with very little BTC in it, and real ones with your real BTC stash. Very useful when being physically threatened to release a passeord.
The passwords will work on any Trezor, so it does not matter if you lose a device.

Use an app such as Authy or Google Authenticator. Also, don't leave bitcoins in an exchange. If you don't control the private keys, they're not your bitcoins.

China is a republic. And yet it's a dictatorship. There are no elections in China. The Soviet Union was a republic (USSR = Union of Socialist Soviet Republics). "Republic" just means that there is no emperor or king. "Democracy" means the leaders are elected by the people. Right now, the USA does not have real democratic presidential elections. Trump was right about one thing: The elections are rigged. Rigged through the selection of candidates in the TV debates (why don't the Libertarians or Greens get to participate?), and rigged because a vote in a small state might count 3.8 times as much as a vote in a state with a large population. So you are okay with the USA being a republic but not a democracy? A country with a rigged election system that is slowly turning into a fasicst oligarchy? Then you would probably be happy living in China or some other republican dictatorship, too, right?

I've said before, and I'll say it again now: In China, most medium sized and large business have to cooperate with  communist party officials who become members of management and/or board.

Dude. It's the logical progession of things happening there. Without exchanges, miners can't sell their bitcoins to pay for electricity and employees. So they will have two choices: close the mining farms, or let the government run them.

Well, I actually don't. What I do is this: I use a Trezor hardware wallet with encryption turned on. That way you can enter additional words called "passwords", but each one of them is really a 25th seed word, so it generates an entirely new set of private and public keys. A thief who finds the 24 word seed of an encrypted Trezor can only access its unencrypted wallets, but not the encrypted / password protected ones - and you can create as many of them as you want.
Trezor rocks.

Thre are more than 1000 altcoins listed on coinmarktcap. Many of them are forks of the Bitcoin software with little changes, for example Litecoin (faster block time and 4 times the supply), Dash (masternodes, darksend) or Vertcoin (ASIC resistant mining algorithm). Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is another one of those forks. Its creators removed the Segregated Witness code (thereby removing the consensual solutions for transaction malleability and the quadratic hashing problem). BCH introduced a so called „emergency difficulty algorithm“ which gives miners an ability to game the difficulty for higher profits and leads to very unstable block times (sometimes 60 blocks per hour, sometimes no blocks for hours). BCH is one of the worst altcoins you can buy into. There are other altcoins that use the word Bitcoin in its name, for example Bitcoin Dark, Bitcoin Scrypt or Bitcoin Gold. I recommend to stay away from them. Buy Bitcoin (BTC).

The article is a bit too sensationalistic for my taste. B2X will be an altcoin, just like BCH.
Consensus for changes in the Bitcoin software needs to be established between developers, miners, exchanges, merchants and wallet providers. B2X has no such consensus and even the miners are starting to turn away from it. Bitcoin will be fine.

Sounds like a good plan. But: Why would you move your BTC to an exchange? You should hodl them in a paper wallet or on a Trezor.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:30:54
You should never leave any bitcoins at an exchange. Small amounts should go to a Core or Electrum wallet or a good smartphone wallet (Greenaddress), larger amounts to a hardware wallet (Trezor, Ledger) or a paper wallet. The important thing is to control the private keys. Do not use fake wallet apps that don‘t give you the key or seed. Do not leave coins at exchanges.
Your private keys, your bitcoins. Not your private keys, not your bitcoins.

Yes, you should do it. We are still in the early years of Bitcoin, not even in the early adopter phase yet. This is still the innovator phase (= less than 1% user adoption. Early adopter phase starts at 2.5% userbase). Buy some BTC now and every following month, and look how the early adopters will start coming in next year, and how Bitcoin goes mainstream ten years from now. Even the smallest amount of BTC will be worth a fortune then.
The most important rules: 
1. Don't invest more than you're willing to lose.
2. Avoid altcoins. Buy Bitcoin (BTC) only.
3. Never keep your BTC on an exchange website. Always store them in a wallet that you control the private key for.

It's actually an attack coordinated by a mining cartel, not by bankers. Some bad actors want to control Bitcoin and take over the name.
They will use both Bcash and B2X to slow down Bitcoin's block times. They will spam the Bitcoin blockchain again with "dust" to create a huge transaction backlog. They will manipulate prices to lure as much hashrate away from BTC and towards B2X and BCH. You can read more about it here:

Bitcoin consensus is not a backroom deal between a bunch of CEOs.

Mining farms usually pay their electricity in advance months ahead. They also have employees. So they need to make money. Since most exchanges, merchants and wallet providers are going to continue to use Bitcoin, and Bitcoin will be worth more than the BX2 fork, most rational miners will mine and sell Bitcoin, not B2X. Even in the unlikely case that the hashrate of Bitcoin drops to 50 or 30 percent for a while, Bitcoin blocks will be slower for a little while, difficulty will adjust and everything will be fine. B2X will be another altcoin, just like BCH. Miners follow the market. They provide a service (securing the network) and get paid for it. Consensus in Bitcoin is established between developers, exchanges, wallet providers, merchants and miners.

To reach larger scale and capacity, networks are usually upgraded using 2 methods: 1) optimizations 2) additional protocol layers. The Bitcoin network implemented two such changes: Segregates Witness is an optimization. Lightning is an additional protocol layer. Both these upgrades did not require a hard fork of the code (which is risky) but a soft fork (more secure). There was consensus for that soft fork in 2017, so it happened and Bitcoin has now higher capacity thanks to Segwit and Lightning.
The people behind BCH believed that it's better to just make the blocks bigger to reach higher capacity. Making the blocks bigger can only be done via a hard fork. Because there would have been no consensus in Bitcoin for such a hard fork, they created their own coin via hard fork, which they called Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Most people would be fine with the existence of yet another altcoin. But BCH proponents keep spreading misinformation about their altcoin, calling it "the real Bitcoin", a lie they will tell to you with a straight face. BCH has less proof of work, BCH blocks are invalid to Bitcoin nodes and invisible to the Bitcoin blockchain. BCH has its own blockchain. Roger Ver, Craig Wright (Faketoshi) and Jihan Wu (Bitmain) attempted to coopt the name of Bitcoin. They thought they could replace BTC with BCH on the market then rename it to "Bitcoin". They failed miserably, but they are continuing their social attack via their website (bitcoin dot com) and Twitter handle (

You're not alone. For years and years I used to spend every Euro I had on things.  Because of Bitcoin I started to actually save money for the first time. You made the right choice with the car: A new automobile is the worst investment ever; the moment you buy it and drive one meter it's a second hand car and worth half of what you paid. In the past three years there was a lot of useless crap that I didn't buy because of BTC, and also a lot of old stuff that I fixed instead of replacing it - which always feels great.

So, transction malleability is essentially the risk that third parties can alter transactions before they are confirmed by the network. Segwit solves that risk, and that makes a lot of cool stuff possible with Bitcoin that isn't possible now. Decentralized exchanges (think Shapeshift without a single point of failure), or paying a merchant who only accepts Bitcoin with another Segwit enabled cryptocurrency (e.g. Litecoin), and bidirectional payment channels (Lightning network).

Segwit makes Bitcoin work better so it can be used for more things and can be useful for more people.

The European Union is a stabilising factor for Europe. It gives us   freedom to live, work and retire anywhere in Europe. It gives us health care in all its member states (28 at the moment).

It offers greater protection from terrorists, people traffickers and other criminals (through europol etc.). It's important to deal with environmental and food safety issues, telecommunications, the European Court and many more things.

User activated soft forks have been done before in Bitcoin. This won't be the first one.

This is a feature, not a bug. HD wallets (wallets with a mnemonic seed) switch addresses every time you receive coins - which is good for your privacy and security.

It's not reckless, it's how Bitcoin works. Miners find blocks by hashing. Nodes validate blocks.

Ionomy is a clone of the Paycoin scam. It's heavily premined, with the same hyperstaking and the same intransparent tactics.
 The white paper for ION was written by Adam Matlack who was heavily involved in the Paycoin scam. 
The software of ION is copied software from Darkcoin (DASH) with added hyperstaking (Paycoin style) and a premined supply: 5.9 Million out of 10.9 million, giving control of highest paying masternodes to the creators.
The Ionomy team has the same terrible marketing tactics as Paycoin/GAW with no corporate or business evidence to back it up. Questions that are being asked on Bitcointalk remain unanswered. They set up their own forum which is heavily moderated and censored similiar to the old Hashtalk forum by GAW. ION is nothing more than a new XPY.

Do it! Or maybe spread between Bitcoin, physical silver and one or two altcoins.
@_date: 2017-07-27 21:14:33
It's a chain split, so yes, after the split you will have one new altcoin token for every Bitcoin that you control the key for. I recommend to just ignore it for the first couple of weeks and watch the situation. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:13:28
I won't even bother. Too much of a hassle.

India has more than 100 languages. The 29 states and 7 union territories of India have 6 different major religions, different laws and different traditions. Does that mean India should not be a country?
The EU will not fall apart. It is the most successful peace project in history. It brought peace and prosperity to a continent that was at war for hundreds of years.

Consensus in Bitcoin does not mean "consensus between miners with the biggest hashrate". Nodes are equally important. Miners find blocks. Nodes validate them.
Consensus in Bitcoin is between nodes, miners, exchanges, hardware producers and investors.

It's hilarious. The Bitconnect people must be very happy about the free promotion.

They should sell the BCC and credit their users BTC for them.
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:18:39
I think the best option is to ignore the new altcoin that will be created, avoiding a waste of time.
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:31:17
I couldn't care less, honestly. In 2014, I was expecting to hold my bitcoins for years or even decades to come. And nothing has changed. Neither the market, nor a chain split, nor the scheming and plotting of Shitcoin Jesus can distract me from my goal to hold BTC long term.

I am looking forward to the slowmotion train wreck that "Bitcoin Cash" will turn out to be. My stash of popcorn is ready. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:45:51
I don't hate it, I just think it's an unnecessary distraction. There are more than 800 alt coins already, 5 of them have the word "Bitcoin" in their names (Bitcoin Dark, Bitcoin TX, Bitcoin Scrypt etc). One more is redundant and will - for  a short time - weaken the network effect of Bitcoin. Read this very good article if you're interested in the reasons for that: 
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:45:47
No. Hoarding is what gives money value. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:49:02
Bitcoin Unlimited is not a threat. It's dead. The Unlimitards are creating their own altcoin now. Basically, they are doing what we asked them for: they're forking off.
@_date: 2017-07-23 06:55:45
It will be another altcoin using the word "Bitcoin" in its name. There are a few of those already. When you search for the word "Bitcoin" on coinmarketcap you will find several of those. "Bitcoin Dark", "Bitcoin Plus", "Bitcoin TX" and others. They are all irrelevant. The proponents of Bitcoin Cash are living in a parallel universe where logic does not exist. And they did not even get their ticker symbol right, because "BCC" is already taken by Bitconnect.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:29:29
I control all the private keys of my bitcoins and don't have any on exchanges. But: I really don't give a rat's ass about "Bitcoin Cash". I won't bother to export my keys to get this altcoin.
And by the way, there already is a currency with the ticker symbol BCC: BitConnect Coin has a market cap of more than 400 million dollars.     
   - so basically, the folks at Bitcoin Cash are even too incompetent to check whether a ticker symbol is already taken. It will be a hilarious slow motion train wreck.
@_date: 2017-07-24 22:26:51
Shitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:58:43
There are several altrnative cryptocurrencies that use the word "Bitcoin" in their name, for example: Bitcoin Plus, Bitcoin Scrypt or Bitcoin Dark. It's easy to create a fork of Bitcoin, because it's open source software. Most of these altcoins are useless or even scams. "Bitcoin Cash" (BCC) will be another useless altcoin. It's best to just ignore it and focus on the original Bitcoin (BTC).

Yes, your bitcoins and your bitcoincash will be on two different blockchains. So you can sell your bitcoincash independently and it won't affect your bitcoins.

Craig Wright is a con artist and he needs to be called out as often as possible, all the time. The fraudster must be exposed.

The real BCC is actually BitConnect Coin, a cryptocurrency that has been around for a year and has a marketcap of 400 million dollars.    
The ViaBTC cryptocurrency exchange stole the BCC ticker symbol from BitConnect Coin to sell a new IOU for a new altcoin ("Bitcoin Cash") they want to create at a later date. That altcoin is supposed to be based on the BitcoinABC software, which will probably be a complete desaster.

Welcome to Bitcoin! &lt;3
Never leave your coins on an exchange or in a wallet that you don't control the private key / seed for.
That's the most important thing.

It's not really that complex. rbtc is a bit like the folks who believe in chemtrails or the flat earth thepry. For them Segwit is some sort of conspiracy by Bilderberg/AXA/banks/freemasons/the Illuminati. It's best not to waste too much time on their crazy bullshit.

Your bitcoins are safe in Electrum. Be sure to write down the seed and store it in 2 or 3 different places. Ignore the new altcoin ("Bitcoin Cash") that is being forked off, because it's irrelevant. 
@_date: 2019-05-29 14:04:38
Yes. Bitcoindotcom is a scam. It's a well known fact.
