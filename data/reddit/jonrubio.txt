I'd rather see some discussion about LN than this stupid Coinbase witch hunting.

I would actually browse r/bitcoin way more if they implemented a meme megathread. You have to dig now to find substance and it's quite annoying.

DAG tech could potentially cause some disturbance imo. However, I think there are other problems that are currently much more of a threat.

Are we really getting government involved with crypto now? You can't be serious?

So hedging is a wild accusation? If so, you've lost your mind.

PayPal? Have you fallen off your rocker? This is crypto we're talking about.

redditor for 5 weeks. name checks out.

They didn't go to an alt coin. It's called consensus. The community is split. We're starting to see why, and with all these bans the inevitable is gonna happen. Be smart and prepare. 
EDIT: And downvoting what your opposed to doesn't change the situation.

I agree 100% but obviously the majority of people on this subreddit have a bias.

Weren't they just fireworks? If they were, who cares.
On a side note, he has a specific vision, where the core devs have a different one. He's can do whatever he wants, and so can the core devs.

Wonder if it will get removed. It doesn't do anything against the community guidelines. I want to hear what the mods have to say.

Glad to see others like yourself agree. The guy above attacked me for an opinion I have. It's if like him and some others have blinkers on and are only focused on the price going up.

A comment like this screams I just want fiat gains at the end of the day. This is why I'm starting to believe Bitcoin is just fad. Bitcoin is not to big to fail and I hope everyone in this sub is aware of that. I hope for the best for Bitcoin but something is telling me we've yet to see what is to come. Hopefully we see some positive changes to Bitcoin soon that keeps it on par with up and coming alt coins. I don't want to see cryptos first real main stream attempt fail.

You bring a valid point and I have no rebuttal. But I will say is I might be a little eager on the decentralization of money lol
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:44:09


I agree 100%. 
Only issue I have is, it being labeled as a store of value. It was proposed to be a P2P Cash which in turn can be also considered a store of value. If BTC sees massive adoption soon, especially with all of the ATMs popping up everywhere and  if it scaling/fungibility does not improve, I think we might see some problems. Then again, its been proven to be resilient.

Well he beat me to it. Since he posted some examples already, I am just here to say that Bitcoin has a roadmap but as of this second there are coins that do things better. Like I said, I hope for the best for BTC. I am just skeptical due to all of the contention.
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:56:09
But the thing with gold is that there's no information base that keeps a record of every gold transaction. All of BTC transactions are recorded and anyone can look it up. I understand the decentralized application of money is huge revolution in itself and can be classified as a store of value, but why would you or me want anyone to be able to verify our wealth or transaction history?

Can someone provide me with the best lightning breakdown the can provide that is sort of ELI13? The whole IOU rhetoric makes me very hesitant to use and I would like a better understanding of it.

Thanks

How am I a troll? Is someone with a non group think mentality towards an idea a troll? There are some other coins that are better at certain things than Bitcoin. This is a fact.
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:40:51
Could you give me an example of a use case for the average joe to want their transactions public? I can see the value in the massive network/blockchain and I can understand use cases for government officials/businesses, but I'm having a hard time coming up with an application for a regular person.
