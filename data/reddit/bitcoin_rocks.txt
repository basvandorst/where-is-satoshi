Email jeff if you want Amazon to accept Bitcoin.
Jeff Bezos has a history of [reading customer emails]( and forwarding them to the relevant teams. Amazon is very focused on responding to customer feedback.

I like Kraken, but if you want lower fees you could always look at using another exchange like [Coinbase]( [Bitstamp]( or [Celery]( instead.

Email jeff  Amazon has an internal culture of taking customer feedback very seriously.

Zoka coffee shops are also on the Amazon campus :)

Bring it to Seattle!!
People can use it for currency conversion when traveling between Seattle and Vancouver.

The Nokia Lumia 1020 looks pretty awesome.  Love the camera.  Guess I'll be ditching my iPhone.

Jeff Bezos has a public e-mail address, jeff Not only does he read many customer complaints, he forwards them to the relevant Amazon employees, with a one-character addition: a question mark.
When Amazon employees get a Bezos question mark e-mail, they react as though they’ve discovered a ticking bomb. They’ve typically got a few hours to solve whatever issue the CEO has flagged and prepare a thorough explanation for how it occurred, a response that will be reviewed by a succession of managers before the answer is presented to Bezos himself. Such escalations, as these e-mails are known, are Bezos’s way of ensuring that the customer’s voice is constantly heard inside the company.

Overstock is currently giving store credit on bitcoin refunds.  That seems fair enough.

Love this idea!!!  Also, check out if anyone's interested in doing mturk style tasks for bitcoin.  It's things like this that I believe can really drive adoption.

Love the idea of bitcoin t-shirts!
Personally I'd want something with a simpler design though (or funny :).  Best of luck.

Jobs4Bitcoin mostly has things such as "[FORHIRE] Freelance Web Designer &amp; Developer" or "[FORHIRE] Websites for Bitcoins" which are larger projects.  Price is negotiated and likely an escrow is used.
Tasks4Coin looks to create a community with small actionable tasks and clear rewards.  No need for back and forth discussion before doing the task.  Some examples:
* [TASK: 5 mBTC] Translate this paragraph from english to spanish.
* [TASK: 3 mBTC] Convert this video from mov to mp4.
* [TASK: 7 mBTC] Photoshop a tiger into this picture of my sister.
* [TASK: 2 mBTC] Find out what mountain is in this picture.

I'm just looking for a new logo in the upper-left hand corner.  I'd also be happy with a banner design too -- whatever you can come up with :)

What alternative do you recommend?  Zidisha offers lower rates but only lends to approved "safe" individuals with an internet connection.  Kiva is operating in more remote regions where microfinance can have a bigger impact.
Please offer constructive alternatives rather than just bashing Kiva (who themselves don't charge any interest).

I looked at the Feliz Navidad sweaters. Are you already out of stock?

There is also the risk of government interference with bitcoin if it starts to undermine official currencies (E.g. USD or Euro).
Governments may use regulations to protect their currencies.

Fundamentally a jobs board such as Jobs4Bitcoin is not well suited to small tasks on this sort.  Managing small tasks (including repetitive tasks) requires a different set of rules, participants and community guidelines.
I could also post a bunch of small tasks to but that doesn't mean I should.  Different communities serve different goals.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:17:02
Thanks!  I've never heard of bitcoinbeg.  It seems someone different though as all the posts are people begging for bitcoins.
My thoughts are creating a community where people (and businesses) only post tasks with clear reward amounts.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:28:19
Thank you!  This just seems like a great way to demonstrate the true value of bitcoin.

Yes, jobs4bitcoin is awesome but it's focused more on multi-day contracts and full-time jobs, not on offering small tasks.

Until people actually start using bitcoin for actual payments and transactions it's all just speculation on future utility.
We need real businesses to start accepting bitcoin for it to become valuable.

Couldn't Namecoin be used as a DNS for Bitcoin wallets?  That seems like the obvious solution.
