Yeah, what a silly error by those fools to keep their money on blockchain a few weeks ago. Better to buy a brand new computer and never connect it to the internet and do a google search and learn how to send funds to a paper wallet without connecting to the internet and then find a great hiding place for the paper codes and never lose them. 
Why would I want to swipe a plastic card and get cash back and be covered in case of theft when I could do all that?

Yeah like that time Chase messed up and all my funds in the account were gone forever.

It's like the house is on fire and starting to collapse, and instead of running outside to safety, you are shouting to everyone, "Hey! I found a penny! I found a penny guys! Look!"

It may survive a zombie apocalypse but will it have any utility when btc collapses?

The reason this was bad for btc is because btc isn't that useful for purchasing anything but illegal shit off DNM in the first place. So when the DNMs keep running exit exams, then there's no reason left to continue to use btc.

Thought this was r/buttcoin at first, then realised butters really have no shame
