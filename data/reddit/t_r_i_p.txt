it says "we're still working on connecting your credit card." sent them a request to speed up order but maybe i'll just give it til morning. it seems like their prime working hours are 10am-2pm EST, and it's 1am. haha

I just dont understand.... why aren't people not okay with not being able to withdraw btc faster... okay you can buy btc instantly but cant withdraw for 4-5 business days? and there's no quicker option? is it too much to ask to have a website get my coins to me that day? coinbase pulls ahead in this regard. By all means correct me if I'm wrong but it appears there's no way to buy and send coins in the same day by Gemini.

yeah, it sucks man. checked my inbox, they did reply to my december dispute so hopefully they can reply again to this and fix it this time. I like this site because it's the actual price of bitcoins rather than way higher, like localbitcoins. and it 'appears' to be quick and efficient.

you all replied to me earlier today stating it was because I have an email provider with "historically high association with spam" 
[safe-mail.net] I am changing the provider now. Maybe for future reference don't allow safe-mail links on sign-up. would save the time and frustration. Glad it was nothing serious though and thanks for following up on this issue.

I use BB&amp;T, maybe that's it? what sucks is less than a week after i made the account i attempted once with a 25 dollar deposit but my friend had made a purchase recently without me knowing causing me to have insufficient funds and get overdrawn charges. So it feels like that particular purchase would have worked if I had sufficient funds but this time I do and tried both methods. Checked account history, no change whatsoever.

update everyone: they do not allow safe-mail email address accounts to make deposits/withdraws. I wish I would have known that when I made the account, but I am changing the email now. Will update.

update: worked quick and flawlessly! thanks for the concern everyone. so happy this works though.
