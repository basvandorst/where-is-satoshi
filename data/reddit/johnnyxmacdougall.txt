I argue that Satoshi Codes, as expressed on the included Wiki Page, are being used in Dogecoin because it is so cheap, and that big versions of these codes can have obvious or hidden meanings.  The trick to finding the patterns is to examine the blockchain in a different way.  I have a website where I fiddle with this stuff, as well as will Obviously Unspendable addresses:
But really what I am trying to express in this post is the original Satoshi Code idea can be seen in the wild, in the blockchains of altcoins, and can express much more than the original spec if given enough digits.

I have been looking for a good tutorial on how to send a OP_RETURN code.  I can use dogecoin-cli to do a sendmany, but I think in this case I would need to build a raw transaction from scratch (maybe).  I see the dogecoin-tx command, but don't see much documentation or examples.  I also pull down some transaction data in python.  Can you point me to a good tutorial that explains how I can mix regular transactions with null return values?  Also, I still like the idea that a wallet user could go to a website and describe a complex transaction, get a big satoshi code, and then turn around and use that code to trigger a proxy transaction from a full node.  For example, I send 10.00055882 to some known address and the owner (running dogecoind) then sends out the two-part transaction including null return part, acting as a proxy for the wallet user.  Thanks

I looked back there.  I had a similar post that died in obscurity a year ago.

I will check it out!

Seeing other people use these codes is exciting because you are essentially peering through the ledger and making sense of other people etching some meaning into their transaction.  For me, it is a fundamental way that communication could arise from within the ledger itself and is more accessible that OP\_RETURN codes.  Anyone can enter this string of transactions from their phone:  
   
0.101010101010  
0.202020202020  
0.303030303030  
The challenge is to find these patterns and requires that all transactions be stored in a database or flat-files, but it is fun (and it keeps me off the streets). ;-)

I made a youtube video exploring the dynamics of this system.  I have come to two conclusions:  
1.  Most users of cryptocurrency can't send OP\_RETURN codes, but all could send a Satoshi Code, because of this, special software, websites, programmers, etc. are needed to develop and run an OP\_RETURN system.  This weakens the distributed nature of the system and necessitates a form of gate-keeping.  Some sites do put OP\_RETURN messages into the chain on someone's behalf, but would become targets  of KYC/AML investigations once they grow their operation to any meaningful size.  
2. The five digit Satoshi Code with three leading zeros is statically significant and appears naturally in less than .1% of all transactions (on the Dogecoin ledger).  This makes them quite easy to find if you collect all of the transactions and analyze them real-time.  While the argument can be make that OP\_RETURN codes will always be better, stronger, faster, their lack of accessibility means that their value would be lost on a user base that is still just struggling to understand what a wallet is versus a binance account.  The fact that Satoshi Codes just work right out of the box is significant.  If OP\_RETURN codes turn out to be so much more useful, then they should win out over Satoshi Codes in the end, but I don't think we have even explored the possibility of alternatives nearly enough. I fear that we have developed a form of tunnel vision that could cause us to operate in a special sort of ivory tower.  
[ .  &lt;---- Here is where I show that anyone can send Satoshi Codes and create a record that is statistically significant in a way that simply can't be denied and is relatively easy to understand.  I do realize that this argument seems counter-intuitive, but when I look at actual adoption of cryptocurrency by people who aren't computer programmers, I think that solutions like this begin to make more sense.  Is this a case of sacrificing the good for the benefit of the great?  It just seems like we have had the benefit of OP\_RETURN codes for quite a while and while we have systems that promise incredible gains, we still don't have a world where you can buy a hamburger with crypto.  Most people's idea of how this stuff works either revolves around day trading or bitcoin used as part of a crime and in that context the finer details of dust and block-size just doesn't matter.

In dogecoin, the cost of this is negligible.  Also, these codes can be sent from a smart phone wallet and a novice user could be instructed to include them and shown how their meaning can be shared off-chain.  It is also possible to send the code without wasting any money with bitcoin.  Consider a $20 transaction where the five digit message 55882 would be included.  By sending two transactions, the exact dollar amount is still sent:  
Today, $20 is equal to 0.00271416 BTC:  
First Trans.      0.00215640 = $15.89  
Second Trans. 0.00055882 =   $4.11
Total                 0.00271416 = $20.00
Because the two transaction would be sent to the same address and possible even within the same block, the message 55882 could be "read" by the receiver.  Because a transaction with three zeroes after the decimal and then five non-zero digits rarely occurs in the natural course of transactions, auditors who are monitoring the receiver for AML/KYC reasons could understand that a meaning or label was attached to the $20 transaction.
It seems to me that this sort of voluntary conspicuous structuring would go a long way to allowing those who are interested in on-ramps and off-ramps to and from fiat currencies to satisfy auditors and governments.
While OP\_RETURN systems are useful, the flexibility and simplicity of this system can be very powerful.
