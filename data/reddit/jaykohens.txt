I’ll sell you cards though. 1060 399 1080 799 ��

You have a “data center” not a mining operation.

I wonder how much meth was smoked in the process of typing all those comments

Miners

I agree, total reform of the global financial system and decentralization of money is much less important than your ability to play pubg. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:52:03
First, you are not directly mining bitcoin. Your GPU is being used to mine altcoins that nicehash then sells and pays you in BTC
Second, the difficulty of mining increases every day, that is why you are getting paid out less.

My bank offers 3 speeds of wire. 
$3, 3ish days, maybe, sometimes
$10, next business day, maybe, sometimes
$30, same business day as long as you submit it at the right time, to the right recipient, under the right circumstances. 
Btc is same hour, low(ish) fees, and no chance my transfer will be flagged for “irregular activity”
From someone who sends 50+ wires a week for business transactions, crypto is much more efficient.

Not once for any business ive ever been involved in have I ever been asked for that information when opening an account. Just a description of what the business does. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:32:11
Never cared to use nicehash so my bad LOL
@_date: 2018-05-11 14:50:26
No, there are no chargebacks or reversals with BTC. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:54:13
Solid TA, lots of good evidence, FA definitely points to it. Amazing analysis OP. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:15:44
You got liquidated. Shit happens. Don’t risk what you can’t lose. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:04:23
Not a scam, that’s just how mining works. Sucks 
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:35:12
Interested. Can you pm some details 
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:44:04
Send the amount you intend to bring with you to a hot wallet, something on your phone like the btc.com app or similar. Use that hot wallet for spending. Leave your hardware wallet at home. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:38:48
The Greg part. Missed that in op lmao 
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:21:25
Not to nitpick but technically those are called center caps 
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:31:10
What the fuck are you talking about 
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:06:30
Cloud mining is bullshit. You will lose money. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:11:07
Stop smoking all that black tar opium you’ve been asking people on other subs about and maybe you’ll understand why this is such a bad investment. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:05:28
21 21
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:41:55
Yes, that’s how they’re designed to be run. Anything else would be a waste. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:40:21
I don’t buy shitcoins. There’s a very long thread on bitcointalk about these miners. If you’re seriously considering one of these units I have a bridge to sell you. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:55:09
How can you not like the people that support the currencies you invest in. Without miners none of this would exist. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:25:44
Just download nicehash and go that route. It doesn’t sound like you want to set up a mining operation, just use your card and make a few extra dollars. 
You’ll make somewhere to the tune of $2-4/day depending on power cost. Your card will be run at pretty much 100% load during this time, can’t do anything else with the exception of web browsing or emails.

FAKE NEWS 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:03:18
Halong is still vaporware. Wouldn’t give them a dime until some of the dragonmint miners show up 
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:19:58
Dumbest post I have ever read. He made a mistake and it’s kraken’s fault? Bullshit
Shouldn’t have all his money in btc anyway 
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:26:23
Wow, what insightful analysis, really enjoy the part where it’s backed by empirical factual evidence. 10/10 would take investment advice 
@_date: 2018-07-15 03:00:41
Shouldn’t mine btc with your cpu. Not efficient, waste of time. Mine xmr but cpu mining is basically dead anyway. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:19:36
Fine with me, I haven’t finished filling my bags 
@_date: 2018-04-30 04:28:01
Dumbest fucking thing I’ve ever read related to crypto 
@_date: 2018-04-14 23:19:26
drove the gla45 recently and is most likely my next car. Congrats! 
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:11:44
It’s barely down $400 stop lmao
