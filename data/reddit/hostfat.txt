By using services as Bitgo/Greenaddress (it is needed that both users use the same service, sender and receiver), the receiver user **trusts** the service (and not the sender) that it will not make a double spend. 
This because the service has the other keys to sign the transactions, so even if the sender will try to make a double spend, the service will not co-sign it. This means that the receiver can accept them with zero confirmations.
The business model of these services is all on this, asking fees for instant confirmations.
@_date: 2016-08-31 20:14:50
I've received an email from them, and then I looked into my account to have a confirmation. It's true.
I think that they are going to say it on their blog on the next hours.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:39:00


They aren't there now. So you are giving hope and trust that they will work good, everywhere and every time, while the problem is already here.
Just to make a point here.

They claim to speak for the idea that he wrote when he was writing, the idea where many agreed at the beginning.
Maybe he changed his idea, maybe not. Currently we don't know, but still many agree to approve this original idea in its merit.

It works "currently" ...
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:51:47


Where is this different from what I wrote?
Maybe I wasn't clear. They had instant confirmation with the other exchanges, because all of them are Bitgo customers.
They have an incentive **to centralize** on using one only service as Bitgo, to have between all of them the instant confirmations.
And again, they needed it because of the current status of the confirmations on Bitcoin because of the block size.

This is your opinion, for what it counts :)
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:39:53
I'm sure that you know the main reason whereby many exchanges have chosen to use all of them the same service (BitGo) instead of their own node.
By using BitGo, they had instant confirmations, faster than the **current Bitcoin setup**.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:08:48
If you have missed it, Bitgo has the same business model of Greenaddress, both services hope to reach the larger number of customers because of the incentive to push other users to use the same service.
Customers need that other users are using the same service (centralizing) to being able to use the instant confirmation feature. (it doesn't work between Bitgo and Greenaddress accounts)
This instant confirmation feature is more useful as much is hard to receive a common confirmation on Bitcoin.
Do you smell something?

**The consensus doesn't come from devs**, this is another bullshit that comes with all the propaganda of the past months.
There can be an **unlimited** number of devs that all agree on giving/forcing **wrong rules** on the network, and then **users/miners**, that are **who really make the consensus**, they will just leave it for another network.
If there are many people that think that it is possible that users will leave banks for Bitcoin, it the same for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-12 20:39:56
There are are many other devs that are working for banks, many more than on Bitcoin, so this means for sure (**by your logic**) that banks are better than Bitcoin.
Where were all these devs that now are following the will of Blockstream when Gavin, Mike, Jeff and others have started to work on Bitcoin? They were just ignoring it or saying that it will never work.
More than everything, by saying something different, everyone went freely attacked by trolls/clones all over the place of the Bitcoin world, because permitted.
How can you think that someone will love to get freely attacked by everywhere by giving their opinion? Mostly none. Welcome to the auto-censure, they will just leave for something else, maybe an altcoin.

The team is something that can arrive even after the market has shown interest on some new rules.


Where did I wrote this? Maybe you are just another troll or a common naive user.


 
Because it is simple logic, no one is forced to follow the new Bitcoin rules, I don't like to repeat myself.
Someone talk about being safe under the "network effect", while by following the network effect, banks are still the winner here. (so another falling logic to defend the current situation)

One possible good thing about this, is that maybe Bitstamp will be able to give nominal IBAN to all its users.

The consensus of developers is mostly useless, because on the long run the best rules that give what the market wants will always prevail, even if it comes from just one dev.
If these rules will not arrive on the Bitcoin world (or they will be hidden/censured), there is an high probability that the market will move elsewhere, as many are expecting for Bitcoin against the banks (moving from a worst system to a better one)
It very easy to move from a cryptocurrency to another one, easier than fiat to crypto.

I didn't see anyone from BU team reporting different/corrected text from the original of Satoshi.

By this logic, it seems that you are saying that no one is able to understand what Satoshi was writing, but maybe I'm wrong here ;)
I also saw many agree on leaving the original PDF unchanged, and then adding a "little" banner to the top (or somewhere else) where it was possible to find a "fixed" paper. Anyway I see this unnecessary, as there is already the documentation to understand how the "Bitcoin Core" client works:

As I wrote, it isn't my implementation, it is from someone else that I know that has read it during last months.

Users want a solution now. It can be big blocks, in a way or another (Luke for sure can propose his way), or something else.
But it is needed now, before the rise of the fees.
It's needed a solution to maintain the access to the use of the network even likely to the poorest person on earth.
Blocking zero/low fee tx on nodes is another change that goes against this idea.

Maybe the common user aim to install/use something that gives him more then less.
So "usually" he will always install an updated version of his favorite client/software, but instead if it stops giving more and instead starts to remove possibilities, then this open the doors to alternatives.
Users will start looking around...
@_date: 2015-06-26 10:30:42
The consensus is the set of rules that maintain rightly divided the powers on the network, to avoid that it align on only one way (example: too much power to miners)
It is "NOT" the consensus between a bunch of developers.
Even if only the last man in the last place of this world will make a new client, and the majority of the network/nodes will chose to use it, then this will be the Bitcoin.
This way of changing the meaning of the word consensus is just used to taking more voice on some controversial ideas, as maintaining the "temporary fix" of 1 MB that Satoshi did.
Some devs are trying to force this limit to "create a problem" on the network, and then pushing their thirty party solutions where they will be able to make money.
The same as Ben Lawsky has done with the Bitlicenze:
"Forcing" the use of lightening network and/or other things (layer 2) is like putting "new objects on the consensus of the Bitcoin".
This is a way of adding external things on the rules that have worked good until now.
Lightening network / layer 2 are good things, forcing them NOT.
@_date: 2015-12-02 17:43:47
They are doing it right.
@_date: 2015-06-25 09:38:13
A Bitcoin network with a block limited on 1 MB is "the altcoin".
I'm here from early 2010, and the 1 MB block limit was just a temporary patch.
Miners make money thank to the value of Bitcoin, the value that is given by common users.
Common users make tx on the confirmed block on the rules that are on common nodes.
Miners are the last in the scale of power on the Bitcoin network.

The price and the cost must be NOT chosen up front of who is giving the service/products and pay them. (nodes and miners)
The right way to act in this case should be adding on the interface of the client something like a checkbox (**un-checked by default**) to block the passing of zero/low fee tx. (or even better an editbox where putting a limit value)

BIP101 is what most likely the represents the original vision, and Bitcoin XT, and maybe btcd on the next weeks, are the only nodes with a good support behind.
If your "Bitcoin LJR" will follow it, I'm sure that you will find more people interested.
There are some choices on XT that some users may not like, but Mike is using BIP101 to tow even them.
Maybe you can do the same to push yours with Bitcoin LJR.
On the long run users will concur on the node/s that gives them the more wanted features, this will be the consensus.

While this is more near the truth, currently neither Bitcoin XT (or other BIP101 forks) and Bitcoin Unlimited are working on a different blockchain than Bitcoin Core (that is currently used by the majority)
So they are still not an altcoin.

You should study more about these two problems:
- Block size
- Fee market
@_date: 2015-12-03 21:02:33
Some nodes haven't any incentives now to maintain themself other than maintaining the network.
They are doing it for free now.
After a possible increase of the space, this is the cost of a 5 TB hd:
I'm sure that there are cheaper.
There are also other nodes that are maintained by the industry, and by making the Bitcoin money more liquid, the market will increase.
With a bigger market and then more services, there will be more nodes that are needed to be sure to know what is happening on the network.
Miners don't seem to have problem of money for buying a new hd...
@_date: 2015-12-14 05:11:12
You are claiming that there was an open, free, well informed decision by everyone. You know that this never happened.
It's like says that there an open election in north korea.
Also, BIP101 was proposed way before the arrive of the problems, and many users doesn't really know what are they using, and how it works.
They are seeing just now the incoming situation.

He has different attitude.
@_date: 2015-06-03 23:57:34
With "node" I mean just a node that verify that blocks follow the rules, this is the job of nodes.
I say "miner" when I speak about miners.
As I said nodes verify correctness of blocks.
"relative to the ~ 10 min target interval, a 1 MB or 20 MB doesn't make a significant difference."
So even 20 mb blocks aren't a problem if you think this :)
The problem of bigger blocks is that they can cost more on nodes by bandwidth, so this can push more nodes to turn them off. (more centralisation)
Or can be used to dos the network with huge blocks. (like 1 GB block)
By the rules that I wrote, if a malicious miner will make a bigger block, than the node will just have to stop downloading it if a second smaller block will come after it.
The bigger block will be orphan.
These possible rules aren't to maintain the block to 1 MB, I think that it's very important to increase the block size. 
I think that this is a very cautious way to do it.
@_date: 2015-12-22 05:54:11
I hope that it will work on this way, but there a time for action while competitors are working to provide alternatives.
Most of them know that the community is wrongly following the authority instead of the idea, this make me afraid.
I'm afraid of losing the right momentum.
@_date: 2015-12-03 21:40:26
If maintaining a node will cost more than the low class population can support, this will not stop the the network from being a decentralized trustless network, accessible to everyone.
If the cost to access the network will rise up to 20$ x tx, whatever will be the cost of maintaining a node, the lower and middle classes will be completely cut off.
@_date: 2015-12-22 09:03:45
I asked to one, and he said that it will be even a huge success a working 1 vs 1 solution.
He said that it can be good to jump on random tables with random players, but players should be "forced" (by the protocol) to block some tokens until they have played X hands on that table.
On this way to it should cost too much on opening a lot of tables trying to find his collaborators.
The amount of blocked tokens should be related to the rules of the table (blinds ecc...)
Have you seen this?

The drama started because the CEO said that he thinks that Bitcoin will not be here on the next years, so some users/trolls and some clickbait news wrote that they where leaving Bitcoin, which it wasn't true.

He has his opinions, which I don't agree with.
An opinion doesn't automatically means a demonstration, and his opinion clearly doesn't demonstrate his claims.
My hypotactic opinion is that 8 MB is better than 20 MB, because with 20 MB there can be some kind of centralisation!!!
@_date: 2015-06-25 09:51:22
They will do it after all the nodes (or the great majority) will support it.
You will see users screaming around because their txs will not get confirmed or they will need fee high as 1$ or more.
The Bitcoin value will start to go down and they (miners) will "choice" instantly to upgrade for higher block.

* 300 €: cool case once prototyping
* 200 €: the main hardware (x86 mainboard + atom + ram + etc., or maybe we can switch on Udoo, which looks cool)
* 150 €: the 10" touch display
* 200+50 €: the banknotes reader\emitter and its own PSU (they suck a large amounts of Amperes)
* 200 €: the fingerprint terminal
* 150 €: the POS stuff
**So you can have, finally, if the project is finished:**
* A two way AVM for about 900 eur
* A two way AVM which can accept payments with credit card for about 1100 eur
* A two way AVM which can accept payments with credit card and do KYC with fingerprint recognition: &lt; 1500 eur

the information required to make a transaction to 
the desired recipient, over a secure connection 
outside of the blockchain. Telepods are cloned by 
the recipient to prevent double spending, and sent 
to the next recipient when desired – or else 
emptied onto a previously-used account on the 
blockchain again. The contents of the telepod are 
therefore recorded on the blockchain at the point of 
cloning. However, if a completely new address is 
used every time, there is no way to know who has 
held the telepod over the course of its lifespan. The 
only thing that may conceivably be inferred is the 
original creator of the telepod.

I see no problem, miners don't work for free, so they'll choose, against each other on how many tx (and fees) to include on their next block.
I'm sure that nowhere it will still be possible to have zero fee tx as example.
An average block size will emerge from this **real** free market, and they will compete each other as they have done until now.

As I remember 4 MB was considered a good result for all the **currently** main situations.
If there is a good way to give the possibility to the miners to increase the blocksize everytime is possible without being dangerous **and without the need to ask to anyone**, then it's a welcome solution.

Release for general testing. This release is set to use the testnet.
The following major changes have been made in this release:
* the translation files are now available on Transifex, anyone that wants to contribute to translations can do so there
* the chat conversation list now only renders the first 12 conversations when the client starts to reduce get_image calls. The rest are rendered as they are scrolled through.
* chat conversations load 20 messages at a time
* notifications load the first 6 notifications when the client starts, and loads the rest as they are scrolled through. This reduces the number of get_image calls significantly.
* moderators you have blocked are no longer shown in moderator selection views
* the settings view doesn't load moderators until the Store tab is clicked
* the settings view doesn't load blocked user data until the Blocked tab is clicked
* full screen shortcut changed to F11 on non-Mac platforms
* a loading state was added to some buttons
* moderator fees are shown in moderator listings
* the kill process on Windows was improved, which should fix a bug when closing the client on Windows machines
Special thanks to our contributors
* keyboard shortcuts, splitting the language files and various bug fixes and translations added by mariodian

Bitcointalk: 
"The Stag Night" is a horror short about three childhood friends who reunite at a cabin in the woods for a bachelor party that goes horribly wrong.
This isn't your typical cheap slasher movie about a gang of horny teenagers with a vocabulary of 50 words between them, who run around a phony-looking filmset screaming "Oh my god! The phone lines are down!" And here's why: our lead character is a mentally capable adult male who suffers a slow psychological breakdown as the ghosts of his childhood come knocking and his notion of friendship is put to the test - in extreme and disturbing ways; we'll be filming on location in the beautiful fairy tale forests of Germany, in some real-life haunted places – a 19th Century Neo-Gothic castle and an abandoned sanatorium where Hitler was once treated; we'll also be working with some amazing musicians to create a unique and unsettling soundscape, in the vein of classic horror films of the past, like Suspiria, Profondo Rosso, and Halloween...

Because it goes against their interests.
Increasing the number of Bitcoin will depreciate their value and then their past and future income.
Users aren't forced on using Bitcoin, so if it will stop being a good resource of value,  they will then start using something else.

Investors are everywhere, they have companies/business everywhere and so even in Europe and other places, where they are **forced** to pay taxes and things with the local currency.


This is true, but it needs to be proved. The code isn't on the master branch, and **IF** it will be proved as insecure, users will just stay on Core or other forks.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:56:33
Yes, but in a case of a more free access to the informations this would had be known to anyone in few weeks, and a solution (fork?) would been found in less time.

That is a legit question, all of these services should give an answer to this :)

The market always knew that it was a temporary limit against DOS as explained by Gavin. 
Nowhere is explained the presence of a forced fee against the users, neither in the paper neither on all the past discussions with Satoshi.
Satoshi has also give an example to change it just after **six month** of his message.
**This always been the common knowledge.**

@_date: 2016-01-14 10:54:23
He was referring on things like this 
A fork of github/Bitcoin isn't a new "compatible implementation", so this is just another way of trying to change the meaning of the words as always.
Anyway at the time the man work time was very little, so things as btcd can still be good things.
@_date: 2016-03-17 14:25:54
It means that the miner will have to pay **the same** for creating an invalid block as a valid block.
With the headfirst mining proposed by Gavin, **an invalid block will live no more than 30 seconds.**, and then all the mining power used to create it will be wasted.
All the Bitcoin system on the core rule that "it's economically better" to do the things right.
@_date: 2016-03-03 20:30:49
Having a dynamic block size is one of the possible good proposals.
* There are millions of users that download huge of files from filesharing network. (and there is already the pruning feature that it is evolving)
* There are millions of users that watch Netflix all around the world.
* There are millions of users that play last gen games on their computers.
Until running a node will be economically/physically available to these kind of wide range of users, the Bitcoin network will still be enough decentralized.
And still, all possible level-2 layers solutions are welcome until they aren't economically/physically forced against the users.
@_date: 2016-01-25 05:56:44
He is behind  a very good product.
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:16:30

@_date: 2016-01-21 22:53:20
It probably breaks if the block size increase even only to 2 MB.
@_date: 2016-01-13 20:15:03
All the written intentions of Satoshi were about a full p2p network of a digital cash, with a scaling size added with few lines of code.
With all the incentives and economic forces included on the protocol.
Nowhere there is mention about second layer schemes or seeing it as a settlement network only.
While I think that LN or what ever other idea can be good for the Bitcoin network, and I'd love to see them implemented and working, there is no way that they have to be forced on users by crippling the base Bitcoin network.
This is clearly against the original vision of Satoshi than many have loved at the beginning.
@_date: 2016-01-12 01:33:37


...and getting insulted by idiots as always ;)
Thank you!
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:35:07
Both Classic and XT remain on the Bitcoin blockchain until the majority choose to move to some new loved rules.
You know that your logic is flawed, because we had other hard forks before.
The strange things is that you even know that you are lying, and you seem really focused on your religious ideas, you still seem comfortable.
At least, this seems strange to me.
Maybe it is just a subterfuge for your mind to avoid looking to the truth about you.
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:12:47
Changing the economic rules and incentives that has moved Bitcoin until now is more dangerous than increasing the blocksize.
If it's true that LN or what else will give users the instant confirmation (or something like it), than they will prefer it for sure instead of waiting 10 minutes or more.
Users will use it and this will automatically lower the number of tx that will be broadcasted to the network, and then again the blocksize needed will be lower.
Users should prefer out-chain solutions because they are faster (they "cost" less time) and not because **forcefully** cheaper.
The blocksize should be always higher enough to maintain this status of direct competition between the two solutions, where off-chain solutions always win over the on-chain solutions because they are "only" faster. (costing less time)
@_date: 2016-01-11 03:55:17

There where 2/3 soft limits before, I think that Gavin proposed them (I can't remember who exactly) to be sure that it was impossible to do other possible DOS attacks and to safe test the code/network while it was increasing.

Maybe there has been a misunderstanding.
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:01:40
You know, you are pushing against the market, this can create bubbles, and a forced soft fork can be the spark of them.
I also think that because of this you aren't really interested in Bitcoin but you are focused on something else.
@_date: 2016-03-30 21:48:14
Trust is needed if you want to be sure that someone (FBI/CIA/NSA ...) hasn't forced them on making a "special usb device" that works different from the others.
If you receive one of them with Bitcoin already in, you aren't sure that this is a special device.
To trust less it's better to buy a device directly "somewhere" and give it (with the just generated private key) to the future payer.
But then you aren't sure that "someone" will be force them (the Opendime team) to make a new special "clone" of the one that you have bought that will work differently.
They need to have something like a timestamp on the Blockchain, to use only a device made before the request of payment, but I'm not sure how to do it and if it is possible ;D
I think that it's better to not put (or asking to) many bitcoins on only one device, and not asking one of these devices as a payment for the ransom of the kidnapping of a son of a president/king :D

A democracy is where a minority with a common vote between them self can still force everyone else to follow their rules.
A common democracy is where the rulers own the majority of the media, and they are able to influence even a minority of the population and so being able to rule on everyone else.
In the cryptocurrencies world I thought that this was impossible to happen, because everyone is free to not use a cryptoc. and use one else or more at any time.
What you are calling "democracy" here is instead the "market demand", that you are wrongly avoiding to hear.

It reduces the bandwidth for spreading blocks, but it doesn't increase the number of possible tx, so yes, block size increase is still needed.

On this rules it's really easy to break any possible **right** consensus by having **one** vip become foolish or being threatened by external forces. (just example)

The economy of Bitcoin as worked until now as it wasn't any limit.
Leaving this limit is a ABSOLUTE CHANGE of all the economic rules that has moved Bitcoin until now.
Leaving the limit forcing a false ""fee market"" (a very misleading couple of words) is the real hard fork.


Just to give a more complete information, there is also the Thiers' Law:
Other than this, gold has become money by being used as a direct payment system, and not a settlement system.
Nothing can become a settlement system without before being used mainly as a payment system all over the world.
I mean, nothing until it is forced on the people, and sorry but it is impossible to force people using Bitcoin instead of other possible **more liquid** cryptocurrencies out there.  It will not work.
@_date: 2016-03-15 19:06:36
I just said about Sampson about using fake accounts, do you know something more than me?
I see that there are some trolls that has all the exact same way of writing and inflaming the discussions, and they like a lot on changing their nickname everywhere (even on chat as Slask), as it was something that they are already doing day by day.
And there are some trolls that are ready to leave many replies on mostly any messages and at every hours, like **it is their own job** (or that they are deeply invested)
@_date: 2016-01-13 04:03:36
I don't think that you know how economic forces work on the Bitcoin network.
Do you know why miners are so afraid of making decisions?
They aren't giving value to the token, it's the demand of the market that is doing it.
They are fucking afraid of doing something that will not coincide with the demand of the market.
The other things is that they don't want to lose money on trying to follow the market because some tech problems (orphans risk etc..)
Miners will never try to enable some new rules if they aren't demanded by the market, and so hark forks will never happen until the right time. (even if all nodes/clients are already supporting them)
@_date: 2016-01-13 15:40:33
I also delete useless spam/trolling (trolling is usually moved on offtopic section) on the forum that "someone" think that it's right to write, but still the very large majority of the users of my section are happy about my actions.
Here in r/bitcoin it happens the opposite.
Can you give some proofs that this censorship by Gavin? Something that clearly shows his intention to censor some good critics and not useless spam-trolling?
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:00:19
I think that they can at least stick a message that explain that core == consensus :)
@_date: 2016-01-19 20:36:25
Do you know that this is even a better reason to push for Bitcoin Classic? ;D
@_date: 2016-01-15 12:45:39
You should also check how much are open the devs on Bitcoin Core on taking advises and on what are they focusing.
 Just look at RBF
@_date: 2016-03-03 18:57:39

Nothing more to say.
@_date: 2016-01-28 04:08:41
There are already some offers :)
@_date: 2016-03-03 22:28:16
Sure, but is then better to be conservative all over the way.
First, there is an huge space between "doing nothing", "being conservative" and exaggerate.
And then changing completely the economic system that has moved Bitcoin until now (**and how it was designed and developed to work**) it is absolutely the **opposite** way of being "conservative". 
This need to be avoided at any cost until possible.
For both things the time is everything. Being conservative must remain true for both things to maintain the network safer **and appealing.**
Bitcoin isn't living in a different universe, everything is moving around and competing things are moving as faster as they can to chew the market of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-25 10:31:00
You don't. You are free to install what ever you like/prefer.
If you don't like Bitcoin Classic (or Core), just don't run it.
You are free to choose.
This is also the reason that the site owner hasn't any incentive to falsify votes.
@_date: 2016-01-14 16:03:18
Sorry :P
There are so many trolls around that write utter bullshits that sometimes I can misinterpreting some obvious sarcasm as yours :)
@_date: 2016-01-25 09:24:09
It will not be anymore cheap/free as for the uninformed votes, and then again, for what?
**No one is forced to install Bitcoin Classic. (as Bitcoin Core)**
Then there isn't the incentive to make fake votes neither for the site owner, neither for someone that has to pay for them.
It's just good to create fake votes until it is free to do, with the goal of discrediting in some way the project.
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:36:38

@_date: 2016-01-25 07:46:18
If they are FORCED to use them, because it is the only way to make on-chain tx without spending $20, then it changes a lot ;)
But I see that it isn't easy to find these jumps on all the logic behind this.
@_date: 2016-01-24 04:06:54
Yes, but this in the best case scenario, I'm not sure that there won't be exceptions.
Anyway this is the goal of this tech/idea.
@_date: 2016-01-25 05:24:16
Michael Toomin is the brother of Jonathan Toomim, who is leading Bitcoin Classic.
The Michael's job is making a good system to ask for opinions about the line that Bitcoin Classic should follow
It isn't a democracy model, **it is a market driven model**.
Devs will see on it what users/miners and others are voting, and then they'll make their decision on how to achieve these requests.
This is different from a "democracy" because **no one is forced to install/use Bitcoin Classic** (as Bitcoin Core)
So votes here are just valid as market research. If someone/something will falsify these votes, then users will simply not install the client.
@_date: 2016-03-03 20:17:30
Oh yes, it's better to move to completely different economic rules and hoping (and forcing users) on new tech there aren't here now and without knowing if they'll work.
As I said, not increasing the block size is the real hard fork.
@_date: 2016-01-25 11:03:10
It is useful for them to make market research, you haven't to trust them. Don't trust anyone.
If they will use it bad, or it will not work, this means that they will not find the majority of the network demand, and no one will install their client.
There is no trust involved.
@_date: 2016-01-25 08:36:55
At the top right you can see "Filter opinions to verified", try to understand it and use it. It isn't hard.
And still, again, no one is forced to install Bitcoin Classic (as Bitcoin Core)
@_date: 2016-01-30 05:03:49

Repo admins aren't forced to accept his code.

You are totally missing the logic here.
You aren't forced to install Bitcoin Classic (or Bitcoin Core), so why the site owner should falsify the votes?
There is no reason, no incentive.
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:43:19
So you prefer to see Bitcoin Classic (or others) developed as a soft fork.
Maybe many will not like this way...
@_date: 2016-01-12 01:21:33
The usually meaning of longest chain is also the one with more work.
Anyway Coinbase is a business so it's obvious that they'll try to follow every possible fork and giving their services to the larger number of customers as possible.
You can even be sure that if the market of some other altcoins will increase they will **also** start to support them.
More users -&gt; More money.
I really feel uncomfortable to explain the obvious.

As Mike can have some bad attitude/idea, **it is the same for everyone**, as for some of the devs on Core. (even Gavin)
The larger downloaded Android Wallet is working thanks to the work done even by Mike.
So, it's good to have some good developer until he doesn't push too much some of his too personal ideas ;)
@_date: 2016-01-14 14:36:11

@_date: 2016-01-31 21:48:36

This your logic/interpretation is incompatible with this :)


happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of
valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.

I advise to put your votes here:
If the classic's roadmap will start to move away from these ideas or principles, then the anger will start to raise.
@_date: 2016-01-28 16:20:10






I agree with him.
What I was saying that every change on the rules of Bitcoin on Bitcoin Classic, will need to receive the consensus on the network.
The majority of users, payment processors, wallets, exchanges, miners, all of them must want to change these rules to change Bitcoin.
So even if on consider.it in some way the vote to increase the coins will win, then this doesn't automatically mean that the majority of all of them will choose to install the new Classic version.
And if we imagine the situation of total idiocy, you will have just to sell your coins for another better cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2016-01-17 01:15:57
What a surprise, this isn't the point.
As you see this is his behavior, he was acting as absolutely sure about his statement.
I advice to give to his new statements the right weight.
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:53:18


This remind me something ...
@_date: 2016-01-24 10:59:08
Oh sure, eMule is still alive, maybe even Gnutella.
I'm sure that many are aiming these results...
@_date: 2016-01-13 04:15:33
There is still even then possibility of the economical conflict of interest.
The thing that maybe scares theymos more than everything isn't the block size, but this on the Bitcoin Classic strategy:
"Keep 0-conf working as well as possible"
This is directly against the LN idea, and maybe he is already dreaming of making money by giving the LN service in some way.
So even if his actions are going to damage the Bitcoin on the long run, he can't see this and he is still only seeing and focusing on doing whatever he can to maintain open these possible doors to get more income.
These are just speculations, but I see these possibilities.
I think that it is similar to the problem of the paid sig on the forum.
They are very harmful the quality of the content, but they forces user to stay more and more time on pages (by looking on useless content), so it's good for the income of the forum (thanks to the ads)
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:56:43
Some of them said that other forks where not accepted after fair discussions.
You know that this is obviously a lie, so I see them as collaborators of this policy :)
@_date: 2016-01-12 03:07:56
Because their market is very low and their development uncertain.
Also when the business is already large, big decisions need much more time.
While a small exchange can start to support a new currency in weeks, a business like Coinbase can take months or more than a year.
The fork is different because it will impact the current user base.
@_date: 2016-01-17 03:00:44
Money can corrupt anyone, Blocksteam team isn't outside of this.
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:05:52

@_date: 2016-01-25 11:22:57
You are missing the purpose of it.
The vote results can even be hidden, because it is a market research.
@_date: 2016-01-25 11:58:54
Consider.it isn't a project dedicated only to Bitcoin, it has different purposes.
On Bitcoin it is used as a market research, it is useful to them to find what the community/customers want.
Making fake votes is like falsify the result of a market research of your next "product", you will not sell any one. (no one will install Bitcoin Classic)
Easy example:
On the next release they will **really** make Coinbase in full controll of the client, who will install Bitcoin Classic? 
**No one**.
@_date: 2016-01-20 10:46:59
Where did you read that it was a biz meeting?
@_date: 2016-01-21 13:40:17

This is how so much work is instead AGAINST the will of the community.
@_date: 2016-01-25 15:32:32




Which is the answer of this question? Why users will install Bitcoin Classic?
Will they install/use it because it has the function that they like, or they will install/use it because they have found somewhere "many votes" ?
**Will you install a Bitcoin Classic that hard fork to 42M of coins because "somewhere" this feature has took many votes?**
"Many fake votes" are totally useless and meaningless.
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:16:44


They own both.
So if you had 1 BTC on the BTCs before the fork, then you will own both 1 BTCs and 1 BTXs.


You will be able to withdraw your 1 BTCs to your BTCs client and 1 BTXs to your BTXs client.
It's better to not moving/accepting bitcoins during the fork time.
@_date: 2016-01-08 00:47:53
To me bitcoin.org is burned.
@_date: 2016-01-12 01:49:30
Coinbase own the private keys so it will also own the bitcoins on both chains.
In the rare case that the network will split in two working chains, I see no problem/cost on giving the users the free choice on which chain moving their coins.
@_date: 2016-01-13 21:00:23
By following this logic the Bitcoin network should be already death.
Nothing stop all the miners (or even the majority) to collude now and start on blocking some tx and making other bad things. Why aren't they doing it?
The protocol hasn't any fix against this, so currently the Bitcoin network should be renamed as the Bitcoin-CN network.
Why is it still working? (and it worked at the beginning) **Because the xxxxxx economic incentives!**
You are claiming that you don't trust on them, and then we are living in fiction world and Bitcoin isn't working.
Even if there was a full working node that will make 42 M bitcoin or that it will steal Satoshi's coin only a small useless trolls will install it for few hours/days and writing bullshits around.
Zero miners will install it because it goes completely against their interest of becoming rich.
Who will buy a currency that has all the bad things of the common fiat currency, as the possibility to directly steal money or with inflation?
The thing that I hate is that these things are completely obvious even to you and then you're just lying.
I think that a node that goes against the economic incentives that have moved the network from the beginning is very dangerous and should be considered as an altcoin! And Core with the limited block is exactly this!
@_date: 2016-01-13 00:14:13
Which one? :)
@_date: 2016-03-10 23:26:46


This is another thing, you are now talking about the block size.
Again, there are millions of users that are playing games everyday (CPU check), downloading movies/files/music everyday (bandwidth and memory space), watching Netflix everyday (bandwidth).
Until a node can be run by these kind of users, the network will be safe as before.
@_date: 2016-01-07 16:53:44
I agree, but they are two different way to attack the network, and then two different solutions.
@_date: 2016-01-23 04:27:20

Do you know what happen when someone say that he will sell oil for a currency which isn't dollar?
So, when oil is needed from all big countries, and it can be bought only by dollars, it's obvious that some investors will maintain their wealth in dollars.
Things are changing now that China and Russia are making agreements, but as you see there are appending many strange and painful things on the Russia side (or near it) ... what bad luck!
Again, with Bitcoin is totally different, no one is forced to use Bitcoin, so miners are totally afraid of making bad moves that will just break all their businesses.
@_date: 2017-03-13 08:13:56
Hmm, I'm not sure, I've heard of other possibilities of doing even this kind of things with soft fork.
@_date: 2016-01-07 20:11:51
Again, another request of trust on a trust less network.
@_date: 2016-01-13 20:38:18
The math says that they will.
Anyway, multiple layers are welcome as I've already said, they just must be NOT forced on the users.
@_date: 2016-01-07 16:45:38
Fees are anti-spam, by design (and income for the miners), and the limit of the block size an anti-dos.
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:52:50
Then use it just to push an update on the block size issue, then change to something else that you prefer, even going back to Bitcoin Core.
The community will be able to push changes on some rules by jumping time by time on new forks, or asking for new one with some limited new rules (at this time XT will probably not be the one, by Bitcoin Classic has more probability)
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:56:49
There are many solutions to the scaling problem, example:
- Open Transactions
- Lightening network
I'm open to everyone of them, but users must freely choose on using them or not.
Limiting the block size and or prevent zero-conf to push the users on them is not good.
@_date: 2016-01-24 11:26:16

This should give you another hint about trolls on bitcoin world ;)
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:13:11
Because you have a distorted view of the meaning of "consensus", as result of the heavy censorship during the last months.
Consensus arises mainly from the network of nodes, from the free choice of everyone of them.
From node operators, fan, exchange, payment processor, services.
Everyone of them will think and choose what they think is good for them self.
Then ... if the majority will update their node, miners will found this from their stats and other stats.
They will check on forums, chat, reddit and everything else to see if this is really true.
Then again, if miners think that it even good for them, they will also update their nodes, and starting the hard fork.
Some votes on a single website means nothing to them.
@_date: 2016-01-31 20:51:01

Attacks cost money, money isn't unlimited.
If it is fiat money (possible unlimited), then the inflation of the fiat money will be unlimited, and everyone will run to Bitcoin.
How many people are downloading movies/games/music online? How much space do they have on their hard disk?
How many people are watching netflix HD and other similar services in the world? **Millions**.
You should make/get some stats by all these kind of users, and you will ba able to see that there is an big number of users, larger than the current number of Bitcoin nodes, that will be able to be one of the nodes with larger blocks.


This is false, they are already rewared by **being able to use trustless network**, and they are **using/running a node** to get this. 
**This is the reward**
If you make it expensive to make transactions on the Bitcoin network, you are killing the natural reward and **working by design**.
LN and Segwit? Good, "maybe" they will be great, but while they aren't there yet, you should **NEVER** going against the market.

I was also automatically down voted lol, this also one of the reasons so I stopped writing on this sub months ago (also because of being repeatedly censored)
Also, when I saw someone making accusation without proofs, the first thing that I think is that he is probably the executor of the same actions.
Maybe the problem was also related with the things that Theymos was doing with the css, or someone else that was just trying to put more petrol on the fire.
Whatever, I don't know if there are bots or not, but I'm sure that there are users that I think that write a lot of bullshits/lies, that are damaging the community and harming people, and pb1x is for sure one of them. (and this place and bitcointalk are censorship approved)
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:40:45
They are planed to go against spam attack that could congest/block the network, as it is happening now because of the limited block size.
Smaller the blocks, cheaper the attack and so easier the result.
This doesn't mean that this is an attack, it is easier that they are all legit users that are arriving because of the increasing of the price.

I'm not saying that the block size should be increased, I'm saying that it should be removed.
I don't know which is the better size for the block, miners should find the better size to time by time, every 10 minutes.
Devs should be never enter any magic numbers on the consensus rules (like segwit), they should instead add features/functions, that will freely help the miners to understand what it is better for the network.
Both to increase the performance and to maintain the decentralization.
@_date: 2016-11-09 21:27:42
Some of them are just fixed numbers, that don't need any change to adequate to the market demand, and they are part of the consensus, while the block size isn't.

Segwit is a way to reach some goals, and Blockstream has chosen a way through soft fork to do them.
As I said the same goals can be reached with a hard fork, with less and simpler code.
The hard fork proposal of SegWit is a way to make the hard fork compatible with the soft fork proposal of Blockstream.
It is only a proposal, and I think that probably no one of the devs of BU has any intentions to spend any time on this idea.

This is your "little" opinion, you should evaluate the possibility that you are wrong.

Then you should better study how the Nakamoto's consensus works.
Everything that can be a problem for the network is then in the concerns top list of the miners.
A not working network means no revenue for them.
The more the hash power, the more a huge investment ready to be lost.

@_date: 2016-12-17 03:56:45
I think that it will be funny to give the user the possibility to set the currency token limit on his own node :)
The most probable thing that it will happen is that the majority will set a lower limit ;D
Anyway, even by changing the limit, the majority of miners will still respect the old rules, because it is what the market/holders will prefer.
Otherwise it is like saying that to kill/change bitcoin you have just to release a node with this single limit/rule removed.
@_date: 2016-11-27 05:16:34

21 doesn't require any trust, it is just a limit that doesn't need to be changed at any time.


And segwit doesn't do this, it will need to be changed, and everytime this will require the trust to some rulers.


If a bunch of devs, that can pivot at any time, has the power to put magic limits, I see a huge problem on the alignment of incentives.

LT is a very interesting tech, I'm not against it or any other off-chain tech.
Every user should be "free" (and not bound by some magic numbers) to use it or not.

Miners are "free" to stop any free (or low fee) tx at any time.

@_date: 2016-11-07 05:38:54






Yes, but what is the "benefit" it is still a value that no one can decide for someone else.




Yes ... but ...




... the miners has to freely choose what it spam and what is not. The value of the token that they are creating is the result of the demand that comes from the people/market, so if they will allow every possible transactions (even the ones that are considered spam by "everyone" else), than this will be a problem for the node operators. This will a problem for the decentralization and the security of the network, and so it will lower the demand of the token, and then lowering its value!
Most of all, miners are miners because of their greed, so the "pure spam transactions" can't exist for longer time. There won't be miners that allow unlimited free transaction, because they always want the larger sum of users money for their services.
This is the Nakamoto's consensus:


assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to
find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.
And it is completely market driven, everyone is going against it (ex: putting magic limiting numbers) to me he is a statist.
If a bitcoin dev really wants to help the Nakamoto's consensus to work better/faster, he should find a way to give miners better features to understand and "freely" act on the market demand.
@_date: 2016-11-23 05:00:17
It isn't, it is just a complicate hack to false the recognition to the old nodes and hide new unproven incentives over the community ;)

I can just spin your argument, and saying that having bigger blocks means having more customers, and then more business that want a secure way to accept Bitcoin.
The most secure way is installing a full node, so more nodes.
And also, you should prove that 5000 nodes aren't enough to have decentralization, I don't see this proof in your message.

Yes he can, because the problem isn't related to the hard fork issue, but it related on who is proposing:

The thing that makes me afraid of the coin voting is the possible theft, like the one of the US state from Silk Road (and other markets)
Maybe it should be something like a signal for the miners, and not something that automatically change the rules of the network.
This is also the reason that I still "trust" more the POW then an even working POS system.
@_date: 2016-12-05 06:37:16
I missed the threats against Core devs, or maybe you're referring to some 0day random user writing some bullshit.

The first rule of Bitcoin: You do not talk about Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-08-14 14:22:21
There are many versions of Cryptolocker, and all of them suggest the victim were it possible to buy Bitcoin, because as you know, common people have no clue about Bitcoin.
The virus suggest different places (services, website, localbitcoin also ...) related to the country of the victim, and between these possibilities there was also coinbit.it.
The guys beyond coinbit.it knew that some people that were buying Bitcoin from them were probably victims of the Cryptolocker, this is the only sure true fact.
But this doesn't mean that they were also beyond the Cryptolocker.
Coinbit.it wasn't anonymous for the owners, so it's like saying that they were receiving like 500 euro (in BTC) anonymously, but they even want to get another 5% by forcing users on buying on their reseller (it wasn't an exchange), and losing they anonymity.
It is very hard to believe this.
It more easy that the police have no clue about everything, and they just wanted to get someone to show it at the public.

@_date: 2015-07-03 19:55:35
To avoid paywall:
@_date: 2015-07-16 00:11:20
Mostly because they don't know that there are bitcoin debit cards easy to use.
And that they can be safe from volatility by using services as coinapult/bitreserve or selling bitcoin on an exchange that doesn't ask for KYC for limited amount, as Kraken. (example, but there are others)
Write a guide that address these two problems (easy to spend and avoid volatility) and you will have a lot of more cam girls.
@_date: 2015-07-16 21:51:50
It simple:
- Merchants: they want to avoid thirty party and fees as much as they can, and they want happy customers.
- Customers: they want easy, cheaper and faster way to use their money
- Holders: they want that all the all the economy and every single person starts to use Bitcoin, so both merchants and customers must be happy, now.
Everything is possible by increasing the block size, and this is why nodes will do it just after that there will be a working client, not matter what some developers thinks.

I think many of them prefer usd, eur and anyway their local currency.
@_date: 2016-02-24 04:50:31
The fee market must be between the miners and not against the users. Miners must compete to give the service at the cheaper price to the users. (By including as much tx as they can) This is the reason that the limit was though as only  an anti-dos system and nothing else.
It was never thought as "the usual" way to make users compete to find a place in the blocks.
Miners have already incentives to make blocks smaller, they spread faster and are faster to be checked by nodes and other miners.
But even if a majority of miners think that they prefer to have smaller blocks, the last miner out of this group should be able to make a bigger block, to take more fees. This is the true fee market, between the miners.
And also here there is still the space for all possible 2 layer solutions as LN. Users want faster tx, they want to spend less time on waiting for confirmations. ( time is money )
An huge amount of them will prefer to use LN instead of waiting (with an on-chain tx) and spending previous minutes of their life.

Release notes:








@_date: 2016-02-10 01:27:45
Are you connecting to Steam from US?
@_date: 2016-02-10 02:52:26


I confirm this :)
@_date: 2015-07-21 09:25:49
Localbitcoins always asks 1% for your Bitcoin, and you have NOT  control over them.
Still, Coinffeine is out from today, and they will probably add other payment processors
@_date: 2015-07-21 08:41:14
It's decentralized because is not based on a central server.
@_date: 2015-07-09 21:59:46
It's true, and I'm not happy about this :P
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:28:31
This seems very coherent to me ;D
@_date: 2016-02-11 19:48:05
You should look on how many BTC are being sold to buy ETH on Kraken.
@_date: 2016-02-11 11:29:24
The truth hurt here ...
@_date: 2015-07-24 00:22:49
Good features, bad title.
@_date: 2016-02-21 06:09:19
This is just how I see this :)
@_date: 2016-02-24 03:25:08
The truth is in the middle, there is a lot of space between the poor people of the 3rd world and big data centers.
How many users are using p2p sharing network? How many users are using Netflix?
Which are their common connection and computer hardware?
@_date: 2016-02-08 22:21:21
I'm sure that many others has done the same thing, anyway I asked it many times in many public and private places ;D

# Release 2.6
 * The source code is relicensed under the MIT Licence
 * First official release of the Kivy GUI, with android APK
 * The old 'android' and 'gtk' GUIs are deprecated
 * Separation between plugins and GUIs
 * The command line uses jsonrpc to communicate with the daemon
 * New command: 'notify &lt;address&gt; &lt;url&gt;'
 * Alternative coin selection policy, designed to help preserve user
   privacy. Enable it by setting the Coin Selection preference to
   Privacy.
 * The install wizard has been rewritten and improved
 * Support minikeys as used in Casascius coins for private key import
   and sweeping
 * Much improved support for TREZOR and KeepKey devices:
   - full device information display
   - initialize a new or wiped device in 4 ways:
     1) device generates a new wallet
     2) you enter a seed
     3) you enter a BIP39 mnemonic to generate the seed
     4) you enter a master private key
   - KeepKey secure seed recovery (KeepKey only)
   - change / set / disable PIN
   - set homescreen (TREZOR only)
   - set a session timeout.  Once a session has timed out, further use
     of the device requires your PIN and passhphrase to be re-entered
   - enable / disable passphrases
   - device wipe
   - multiple device support

There isn't trust for something this "Bitcoin Roundtable".
Bitcoin works thanks to incentives, **no unity, no trust.**
@_date: 2016-02-05 18:46:02
I think that I will not say neither good things or bad things until they release their first open source version.
And also I will not use them until this time.
@_date: 2016-02-13 16:38:59
It is not, it is worse than the Bitcoin Foundation.

The instructions for Okpay:

Maybe he know about the past forks, but he is point to this one as the first hard fork between different ideas in the community.
I'm not sure anyway.

Thank you! but the video isn't mine :D
@_date: 2016-02-24 02:00:56
Link to the source:


Maybe, anyway "blocknumber" isn't easy to game as a meaning, but I can agree that it can be just an example.
However for his example he choose a number 6 months away at the time, not years ...
Someone can argue that Satoshi was wrong on his choice, but I think that it is impossible to argue that he had a different idea of the network at the time, different from what current Core devs are pushing at our time.
@_date: 2012-10-22 01:14:24
the hashination market! ;D
@_date: 2016-02-09 16:04:12
Maybe it's better to wait for the final version, and the put a very little amount at the beginning.
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:46:57




There is a lot of space of possibilities between 1 MB and 1 GB blocks. (random heavy number)
You have to put down clear data and numbers as a base for your claims.
You have to confront these data with:
- Number of users using Netflix (heavy use of bandwidth)
- Number of users downloading and saving movies/games/music from filesharing networks or services as Steam (huge use of disk space)
- Playing common computer games (CPU for checking blocks)
Watching Netflix, downloading movies day by day and playing computer games isn't something that is possible to do only on data centers.
Current plan of the Core team is moving away from the original plan, so they have to prove with data that they are right. 
No one has done this until now, so I call this a bullshit.
@_date: 2016-02-01 11:01:46
Miners won't start to support Classic until they are sure to have the support of the majority of the network (nodes, exchanges, payment processors, wallets, minters ...)
@_date: 2016-02-10 03:38:59
If you are talking about the Bitcoin Classic fork, the fork is **enabled by the nodes after 28 days** from the reaching the 75% of the last 1000 mined blocks.
@_date: 2012-11-26 08:33:16
All "well-informed" geeky nerds already know these things and are probably reading/writing on other places like this and official-forums.
@_date: 2016-02-15 01:57:06
Are you using 2FA on your email and blockchain.info accounts? YES/NO
@_date: 2016-02-01 11:31:27
Classic is still not released, and it is a new "situation" for the entire network. (even if it is only Bitcoin Core v0.11.2 + 2MB block size)
Miners and nodes will have their time to test it after the official release, and they will make their choice.
@_date: 2016-02-05 07:48:20
You didn't read it, as many others.
@_date: 2016-02-10 01:43:35
It seems that Bitpay enable the conversion just to one currency, so they (VALVe) had to choose USD.
They probably need to open another Bitpay account for the european market.
Maybe they are just starting to test it on US market.

@_date: 2012-10-22 01:25:53
Is it possible to open something like pools?
So more users will try to hack the handshake and then they will get an amount of the bounty according to their work.
Some people will prefer to work in solo, other will use pools.
After there should be a client ( that connect to your service ) on our desktop where we can set filters, example:
- Auto start GPU work if it find a bounty is higher than X
- Auto start GPU work if it find a bounty has already a dedicated pool.

While here (on r/btc) instead is a click away and the user doesn't need to learn anything new. The opportunity cost is nearly zero. It obviously different, so you are a common troll.




Yes, but everyone can do this, and the accounts are usable on any subreddits.

Maybe you are too harsh, even if it's true that the Blockchain and Bitcoin can't be divided, it's true that it can be a good "marketing" idea to push common people on looking only to the Blockchain part at first, and not directly on the Bitcoin.
The bad move is when someone goes forward on saying that you can have another Blockchain in some other ways ...

People like to meet other people and to talk each other on topics that they love.
This is the only reason so that you liked the Montreal conference, because you "felt" to be part of something big.
The same happening during concerts and football game.
Still, the conference was just a waste of time and money on the topic scaling bitcoin, there isn't any result from it.

A_rank = 50 and B_rank = 10 , the sum is 60
C speaks, 100 bits. 100 / 60 = ~1.66


Yes, and this can be wrong, as I said it was just an example.
Maybe there is a better way to make it working properly.
I'm actually thinking deeper to see if I can find something better.

@_date: 2015-09-14 02:11:56
Every chars written on the chat costs X bitcoin (maybe satoshi)
Example: 1 bit (100 satoshi) : 1 char
- Bob put 100 bits on the payment channel, so he will be able to write some phrases, but not more that the sum of all chars will be over 100
- Even Alice has just put 100 bits on her payment channel
They have both rank 0 (zero)
Bob writes 10 words, where the sum of chars is like 60.
Alice has still rank zero, so she will not get any Bitcoin.
Now it the hard part, how the rank should work?
Should it be based directly or on the written chars or something else?
Maybe the best result can be achieved with different attempts.
Just for the goodness of the discussion, I'll consider it directly connected with the written chars, so Bob now has a rank of 60. (he wrote 60 chars)
Alice write some words, where the sum of chars is like 50.
She will lose 50 bits, that will go to Bob.
Bob will also lose value from his rank, so now his rank is 10.
It is getting even harder with the arrival of Charlie
Charlie puts 500 bits in his payment channel.
As Bob and Alice, even Charlie starts with rank zero.
He writes many words, 100 chars, so he will lose 100 bits. (and he will get rank of 100)
Bob will get ~1660 satoshi (1.66 bits * 10), and Alice will get ~8300 satoshi (1.66 bits * 50)
Both their rank (Alice and Bob) will go to zero.
This isn't probably the perfect math to make the system working right, but I hope that you have better understood the idea ;)
@_date: 2015-09-30 23:34:02


That design decision comes from a fundamental (but rarely discussed) design requirement Satoshi had, which is that all entities in Bitcoin must be able to join and leave at will, unannounced and anonymously.
If you want a purely decentralised system, this is a "hard" requirement, it's non-negotiable. Bitcoin simply wouldn't work without it.


@_date: 2015-09-08 16:11:25


Here you are referring to a "consensus" as something that happen before the "consensus on the network".
The real consensus is only the last one, and you know it.
You (like others) are trying to change the meaning of the "consensus" word and you know it. You are likely lying here.
How it is possible that you had become so corrupt?
@_date: 2015-09-14 01:05:38

* It can be useful for people that want a full bank account easly outside his own country
* For people that live abroud europe
* The corporate account can be even opened from companies outside europe and more ...
* You can ask many cards with different names, both private and corporate account.
* It gives a different IBAN for every currency, and you can exchange them internally.

yep, just wait for the next pool then! ;)
@_date: 2015-09-25 19:09:03


Sure, it's a supply/demand situation, but the supply come from the miners and not from the devs.
Then, there is a supply/demand situation betwean devs and miners.
If a group of devs will not be able to satisfy a demand, another group can try to supply it.
@_date: 2015-11-11 19:58:59
Hmm, I don't know this detail, but now that they've opened, you should ask them directly.

It has some similarity to this idea: 
I still prefer mine, less actions from users and more like an automatic result of their connections/cpu.
Everytime a bigger blocks is "able" to arrive and get checked before the smaller block, than the computer of the user is able to receive blocks of this size.
If the average of the blocks in the last X weeks is bigger than the past average, than the node will stop to give priority to blocks smaller than the past average value. (and will use the new average value)
@_date: 2015-11-20 14:30:56
oooh! What a surprise!
Can someone give me the reason? -_-
Hint: Siz...
Maybe in few weeks every pools will have an accounting system where users will be able to push their tx by paying a plus, if they want a faster confirmation.
Then, where will the common users go? Big or small pool? Hint: Faster confirmations ...

The faster the hub get confirmations, then the faster it can open other channels (and getting more income from channels fees in shorter time)
On a full scale usage the user (or better, the pathfinder on the client) will need to find some "empty slots" (it depends on the amount of Bitcoin) on the hubs to open a new channel, then hubs of mining pools will be the faster on recycle their channels spaces.
This by including mainly their own settlements (and/or who paid a subscription) on their blocks.
Then, again, big pools have advantages in this situation. (with a limit on the block size that creates a market of fees)


It isn't good to just look in to only one direction and ignoring all other things that may changing around, and the market of fees is one of these things that need to be watched closely.

There was these kind of statements before the initiation of the debate, so I think that it has been good that Gavin and Mike have started it.
In fact, now the problem isn't about increasing-too-much the size, mostly everyone agree on this, the problem is making it large enough to avoid an easy creation of a fee marker.
The common user should not be affected about the fee, he should be able to make the tx at the cheaper cost possible. (and miners are going to make money, years by years, by the increasing number of users)
@_date: 2015-11-22 20:53:57


This is true, but all the final settlements of all the hubs and direct channels will still be need to go through pools, and the majority of them will be on the bigger pools. -&gt; And still bigger the income, then larger will be the hubs -&gt; ...

@_date: 2015-11-23 03:27:53


Getting money in advance, even a month in advance. (subscription)


Paying less then the normal fee in the hope that a random miner/pool will get it.
The mining pool can ask a sum of bitcoin that divided by some X possible txs will result in a lesser cost for the user.
"Pay me X Bitcoin in advance and I'll give you high priority on my blocks for 1000 tx that you will be able send through me on this month"
This wasn't possible until now because the user was almost always sure to get the first confirmation on the next block by another random miner.
This is changing during these last months because of the limit on the size of the blocks.
@_date: 2015-11-16 04:19:11

They can trust a supermajority that supports **a scaling solution**.
A supermajority doesn't mean that it is choosing the best solution.
The world is full of these examples, they are called democracies.
The difference here is that everyone is free to chose the supermajority (network) that he prefer without the same cost of changing his residence/country, it's just a click away.
@_date: 2015-11-11 21:24:15

By pushing the market of fees, you are even pushing pools on accepting directly a plus in advance, in form of a subscription, to get a priority on the tx that you will send directly to them.
On this way, **users will always prefer to send their tx on pools with large mining power**, to be sure that they will receive a confirmation in advance. So big pools are probably going to get a new form of income that it wasn't expected before.
BTCC is opening his BlockPriority service now because **only now** it is becoming an useful service for the users, with the increasing of the fees: 
As you see playing with the economic forces on the network has a very direct effect on its possible centralization.
@_date: 2015-11-23 20:02:26
How much did it take Bitcoin to arrive at this number of txs? It will still take much time to arrive (if it will ever arrive) at the numbers of Visa.
Still, common users must NOT be forced to use something else because of the fees.
If the user will choose to use other things as the LN, he must make this choice for other reasons, like faster confirmations.
On this way, whatever will be the size, users will probably "prefer" to use the LN. (and blocks will be "naturally" small)
They must not be forced, or it breaks elsewhere.
@_date: 2015-11-13 17:35:01

Increasing the block size and maintaining the decentralization are two goals that can coexist, this until it's possible to avoid that common users won't crash against a fee market.

They can send to everyone **now**, by simply pushing the tx/settlement to a random node.
With a market of fees it will be different, they will be inactivated to send to the bigger pool and pay them directly. (and the pool asking for paying in advance, as a subscription)


If it has the majority of the mining power, it also means that it has a greater income than others, so it's able to make competitive fees.
Then users/hubs will have two reasons to use its hub/services:
- Lower fees
- Avoiding slowdowns on using hubs with low priority/probability on lower pools.


It isn't a problem until there isn't a marker of fees. Without the incentive to use their services (to save time), obviously the service doesn't even exist.

Maybe it did, maybe not, but **now** there are people that are trying to test it.
Just saying.
@_date: 2015-11-22 22:31:53
This is true and simple **now** because you are pretty sure that a random miner will put it on the next block, with the common fee...
But what changes after the possible arrival of a market of fees? (that someone is expecting)
This can become less secure as I explained here:
In this possible situation, **a big pools** have these characteristics:
- It can choose more frequently (because they make the majority of the blocks) who and who not is able to get in its blocks. (so hubs have an incentive to send their tx to the biggest pool)
Someone can say that miners can do this even now, but it's different, with blocks always full then the space on them become a very rare resource. So it gets more hard to find another random miner that will give it a go for free or a small fee.
- It can give a priority to the settlements of its own hub
- It can ask a bigger fee for the settlements of other hubs to be included on its own blocks while asking much less to the users that are going to use/subscribe to its services.
These things worry me.
@_date: 2015-11-22 20:25:56
The LN "hubs" are useful to make connection with other hubs where the transactions move.
The wealthier is the hub, the larger is number of txs that will move through him, and then larger will be his income.
@_date: 2015-11-11 23:38:24
The majority of nodes still have all the power, the power to change rules if they want.
So miners can't do bad things, or all of them will be cut off.
Nodes (that have all the rules) are used by real people for their needs.
This can't be faked.
A bad miner can create likely infinite nodes with the rules that he prefer, but it will be like talking to himself.
The value of prize that he receives is guaranteed by the "real" owner of the nodes, **with a precise kind of rules.**
@_date: 2015-11-17 19:34:36
@_date: 2015-03-28 19:17:23
Hmmm, I see it as a meaningless attempting if the user always know that it will fail.
Also, the wallet of the merchant also can already say that there is another tx, because it's available on the network even before the user start the double spending.
I see, there is a problem if the user send the first transaction "only" and directly to miners (and they don't send it back to the network)
@_date: 2015-11-22 07:22:34
nobody cares

A trustless ledger is useful to everyone, **even banks**.
To maintain its complete trustless feature, it needs to remain decentralized.
If it isn't decentralized, it become again the old common database, so it isn't anymore trustless.
So even banks **need** that it remain decentralized.
The centralisation warning that some are spamming around it is used as a false flag to push the look in other directions away from the reality.
There is just an entity that it is gaining from the current centralisation on the Bitcoin system.
@_date: 2015-10-13 02:21:59

A miner has an incentive to double spend a tx that is higher than the prize (2.5 BTC), so **with this kind of modification**, it is really a bad idea to accept tx higher then 2.5 BTC with only 1 confirmation.
Users/services should wait more confirmations if the want to accept tx with a value higher than 2.5 BTC

I think that it's the opposite.
He is saying that "a lot of people believe this", but this doesn't mean that these people counts, and this is because he is saying "believe", by being naive.
I truly believe on the effect of the free market, and this is also the reasons that he thinks that it's useless to go to speak to the miners, because they "have" to follow the market, they can't influence it, they can't make the rules.
Nodes make the rules, and nodes can be easily run from everyone else, the real market.
@_date: 2015-11-07 16:12:32
You have to remember that moste of the power to change is in the hands of the nodes and not the miners
Nodes arrange the fork, miners enable it.
By this way, if the majority of nodes (that represent the real network/market) arrange a fork, then it is even possible that few miners enable it.

No, read more carefully.
I'm saying that if something goes wrong, all the "real nodes", the nodes maintained by all the people that love the Bitcoin network, they will change their nodes/software. (the rules)
Even if they are only 1000 of the 7000 nodes, it still means that all the remaining 6000 "fake nodes", maintained by the "bad miners", they will be just useless.
Miners make money because the prize/money (and the blocks) is accepted by the people as money.
If the miners are making blocks with the old rules (that they used to do something bad), these blocks will be ignored by the real new "1000" nodes.
In this "extreme" situation, the first miners that will agree to follow the new rules will make a lot of money, and they won't be alone for a long time ;)

Maybe many are missing that Bitcoin can be useful to many people and entities **while it is decentralized**.
So it can even be useful also **to banks**.
There is just **one entity** on the entire Bitcoin system that gains from its current centralisation.

All your hopes about LT are in the world of rainbows and ponies, it doesn't exist and we don't know if it works.
Still, it's ok if it will come.
Unlimited blocks and LN will coexist, and if there will be a problem from one side, users will find a solution in other one.
You are the one that likes to suppress the market with violence or censuring other possibilities.
Bitcoin will never be free, miners will always ask for fee for their work, and they will be in competition.

No, you don't understand how the network works.
Even if Mike or someone else will make gigablocks, no one can stop someone else to develop a new node that only accept smaller blocks.
And if the market, the network, the users, will want this kind of nodes (and smaller blocks), **they will install them**.
No one will be able to prevent them from doing this. (no one can stop the users from installing whatever they want on their computer)
Then you will have the majority of nodes that will stop accepting bigger blocks, and miners will be FORCED to obey to these new rules.
Nodes make the rules.

It's likely impossible to get Bitcoin at **market price** with cash (anonymously), and there is an huge demand.
It's easy to exchange eur with Bitcoin on an exchange, and then send them to someone else without knowing anything about him (again, the customer is only giving cash). It's is not the same with other currencies.

I think that more than a question this seems a advertise for this conference.
There where a plenty of time and possibilities to discuss this topic on the official mailing list, but it was always avoided.
I think that all this slowing down the way to find solutions is directly connected with the flowing of the money from investors.
The faster a solution arrive, the lower the money from investors that will arrive to their pockets.

And that the nodes (the larger part that represents the Bitcoin economy) will not accept it just by **doing nothing** (even knowing nothing), this is the big difference.

Good to know, but now this is uncertain :)
There can be some reasons so that he didn't accept it:
- He didn't know it
- He still thought that it was a waste of time.
- He doesn't like to accept money/favours from people where he doesn't agree with
- In reality he didn't receive the same deal ...

Divide the block time confirmation by 10: one block for 1 minute.
This is probably one of the next steps.
**Obviously even the prize will be divided by 10.** (so, with the current prize 25 BTC, miners will get 2.5 BTC every block/minute)
Users will still have the possibility to freely choose how many confirmations they will feel as secure to wait.

It should, but I think that with the market of fees there will be developed some pathfinder with user's preferences, like:
"I prefer to connect to the hub X because I know that it has an agreement with pool Y"


Because some that are pushing for the LN are **also** pushing to have a market of fees, so talking only about the LN is only half of the possible issue.
I've nothing to say against LN currently, it is a welcome tech.

# Release 2.5
 * Low-S values are used in signatures (BIP 62).
 * The Kivy GUI has been merged into master.
 * The Qt GUI supports multiple windows in the same process. When a
   new Electrum instance is started, it checks for an already running
   Electrum process, and connects to it.
 * The network layer uses select(), so all server communication is
   handled by a single thread. Moreover, the synchronizer, verifier,
   and exchange rate plugin now run as separate jobs within the
   networking thread instead of as their own threads.
 * Plugins are revamped, particularly the exchange rate plugin.

No lol, I'm not stumbed :)
If there is a situation where the majority can't run a node anymore, and they see it as problem, they just need to make a savepoint of the current Blockchain (wherever they want) and force a new rule after it (like, small blocks).
It is the majority that choose the rules for what is money for them.
The only situation where this isn't possible is when someone/an institution has the power to control all the possible connections on the Internet. (like nord korea)
Anyway, in this hypothetical situation it is impossible to make any choice whatever is the blocksize...
@_date: 2016-05-19 09:11:38

You are then expecting that **all miners will find everytime at the same time the block**. In this **exception**, than yes, there can be "possibilities" that it can be a good idea to make empty blocks.
How many times does this happen? The probability is very low, and also with xthin blocks the situation is even less.

@_date: 2015-10-24 05:41:07
Do you understand that this means that I'm right? This means that it is even possible to make unlimited size, miners will soft limit it to avoid orphans.
@_date: 2015-10-25 00:58:35
Yep, this can be a problem, but there are some way to get around maybe :)
The merchant should not make changes too much bigger, there should be a limit. (ex: 5 euro for a product and 900 eur of "change" isn't good)
And he should send to the exchange no more that he is taking from the sum of the receipts. (and maintain the money of the "changes" in cash)
On this way, he can still make this kind of promo and mantein a low profile.
I see that it gets harder on this way, maybe in some places/countries in Europe is easier than others.

Gold does still have value mainly because speculation, the same as Litecoin.
Litecoin has very few tx, but it has still value on the market, even if it's probably going to die.
Gold has value because many thinks that it will be the only store of value if will happen a big economic collapse, maybe that will even going against electricity.
If the possibility of transacting Bitcoin will be perceived as insecure or expensive, you can be sure that something else will take its place.

For a miner/pool getting a total income for months in advance by many users means being able to invest more in mining before the competitors. (and before the next difficulty adjustment)

At the worst situation, it is still possible to come back or use one of the other many networks available.
This doesn't mean that we need to find **this** worst situation of course, but just that it isn't the end.
The end of the network happens only when the market find another better performing solution for its main demands, and it's impossible that it comes back until it arrives a new generation (15 years)

This is just your personal assumption without taking in consideration the advance of the technology.
Until there isn't a true demonstration that this is going to harm the network, it's better to leave it the right space to maintain the economic rules that have acted on it from the 2009 until now.
I agree that some sizes can be too much, but anything that will force right now a fee market on the common user must be avoided.

The majority of people that want a kind of network **and their own nodes** make the rules of the network. Only them.

The rules of the network come from the nodes, that are cheaper to install and to execute.

The following significant changes have been made in this release:
- you can now save and edit server configurations, and quickly switch your client between different servers.
- the navigation menu has shortcuts for switching between saved server configurations.
- you can now set a SMTP server in settings/advanced to send email messages when various events occur.
- if a listing can't be shipped to you, it is marked with an icon in the Discover and Store views.
- listings are marked whether they are a physical, digital, or service listing. This only applies to listings made since the server was updated with the code to show this data.
- basic information about your transactions can be exported to CSV from the transactions page
- follower data on your store page is now lazy loaded, which should dramatically improve performance for stores with many followers.
- chats with unread messages are positioned at the top of your chat list
- the local node is only started if the client is currently set to connect to it
- the shortcuts were changed to avoid colliding with common system shortcut keys. The reload the app shortcut is now 'f', and refresh the current view is 'r'.
- you can add and remove a user as a moderator for your store from their user page.
- Bitcoin prices are now formatted according to the language of the user.
- a bug in the link for a listing in the transaction modal was fixed.
- you can no longer attempt to purchase your own listings (the final step in the purchase flow is not clickable)

LOL, very bad analogy. How can you compare a totally centralized system as eGold to Bitcoin? 
Bitcoin (or the common cryptocurrency idea) is here to avoid any compromises, it is here not give a fuck to regulators, nothing.
If Bitcoin will fail somehow, the market will just move to a new better one, and it will do this faster than it was from fiat to Bitcoin.

Again, the holder will have the coin on every chain.
Anyway, while I think that you aren't understanding it very well, are you saying that we can just send "How to kill Bitcoin" to the NSA/CIA ?

I think that the best result can be that every user can choose his own preferred admin/mods, and **see the statistics** of what the other users are choosing.
So the subreddit remain the same, but every user will see the political line that he/she prefers. (and can easily switch to something else)

The app should be asking to the user (you) to make a report for devs at every crash.
It will include "some logs" that they will be "very useful" to fix bugs.
If you want you can start again the app and make happen again all of these crash and then send these reports.

It's not, but it is probably too difficult to you to understand it.
I agree with her on this:


But "many" doesn't mean all of them and "everytime".
I saw her video, and she told about her experience, and I'm sure that in the situations that she lived it was the right thing to do.
Still, I don't change my view.
Think, it isn't so hard to understand that some situations are different, make your mind more elastic.

He said many times on twitter, directly to me that Bitcoin was shit and was going to die in few weeks. Now is making somersaults to get back from these statements.
Anyway I care about their opinions, but I listen to all of them and others and then I make my opinions, even by studying directly the problem.
You make your reply about the problem just by quoting some "big names", and this is a full appeal to the authority, zero arguments.

I think that all depends from the interface.
Maybe there are more solutions, I can see two now, and maybe the second one is what you will probably prefer. (even if I'm not sure that it is easy to develop)
1) The interface should be clearly show somewhere that there are other teams that are getting trust from the users (some colourful text showing somewhere...), so the user will become interested to see what is happening.
2) When the user arrive on the subreddit, the first thing that he will see is the choice for the point of view. Maybe it can be the stats page or a simpler version of it. So he will chose which "version" he want to see. The choice can be saved on cookies if the user isn't registered.
Maybe the POV can be used as a tag on the url.
I think that after a modification like this, it will be a killer feature of Reddit. It should be promoted everywhere. So every user will know that Reddit is the first and only place on Internet with this kind of moderation. Users will come here because of this feature, and so again whatever they will see, by knowing that this kind of moderation is the killer feature, then switching between the POVs will be the first thing that everyone is going to do before choosing their default one.

Remember that you are free to install whatever you want on your computer.
The consensus will be the result of the free choice of every user and his node.
If Brian Cohen's idea is bad, users just need to install another client that doesn't follow his rules.
The majority will chose the rules, and the others are free to use what they prefer in another network.
The free market will reward the best one. (network)

And it should be cheaper as possible (likely free) to be able to be a "validator of identity"
This to have always a good possible competition.
If there were only one or few validators, I will be worried that they could blackmail me, by threatening me that they will delete my identity.

Maybe the stats can show when a mod/admin was added by the first admin, when a new admin as started to be chosen as a point of view from the users, how many users are choosing this or other admins, how many users have switched their default view and when ...
I think that this can be even useful to the moderators themselves, to see that they are probably doing something wrong earlier.
@_date: 2016-07-29 16:30:16
If you think it deeply, it is like the same as not buying altcoins with their Bitcoin.
Even if it's better, because after the hard fork you have both coins, so you have the choice of doing nothing.
You are starting from the point of view of the Bitcoin maximalist, that there will be only Bitcoin.
I think that it's better to think that yes there will be only one coin (so just "maximalist), but that it isn't sure that it will be Bitcoin.
It is difficult to see anti-fragility if no one care about the fragility (Bitcoin-maximalist), and seeing different opinions being cleared. I see this as a red flag.
@_date: 2016-07-24 22:34:22
and he was right.
Hard fork are the cleanest way to update the network, and who ever is against the hard fork is someone that he is afraid of being on the wrong side, so he will spread FUD.

@_date: 2016-07-29 17:56:57


No, to me this is totally meaningless.


There should be even one fork per block to me, the better chain/fork will survive on the market.
If someone doesn't agree with this idea, I think that he has put his money/time on the wrong place.

I started to think that who ever is against a hard fork is someone that he is afraid that he and his service/product will be on the wrong side of the market, or anyway he has something to lose personally. (that it isn't on the interest of all other users)
@_date: 2016-07-18 15:51:06
@_date: 2016-07-29 16:32:00
So you think that both chains can survive?
By this logic you should be already worried of all these altcoins!
@_date: 2016-07-29 13:08:13
I'm not sure on how easily can be done, but it's good because no one will be removed, simply users will know directly from the interface that maybe something is happening on the subreddit, and maybe it's good to see other points of view, or even switch completely.
It will be then a more market driven moderation, and the possible censorship will be very hard to maintain.
@_date: 2016-07-31 06:50:06

It is different because now it's isn't sure that all the users of a subreddit know the other/s one, and most of all, with many subreddit you are asking the users to post their messages/news on everyone of them.
It needs a lot of more time and it is easy that discussions don't include anymore all the points of view.

@_date: 2016-07-29 18:45:05
It was an exaggeration to explain that even with a fork at every block the best chain will survive, that market/human kind need to follow the shorter way to reach its goal.
So the majority of the people will always aim to one chain only.
And ... a fork of the same chain will always have the same coins of the parent one.
If you are worried about leaving the coin on the wrong one, the risk is no more than being on Bitcoin now while on the long run the best coin will be another one.
If you think that the current chain (on Bitcoin Core client) is the best one, even with a new fork from someone every day, you should just stay on the Bitcoin Core one as you are doing now.

Bitcoin has a limited divisibility, "only" 8 decimals.
So "actually", any project that has a fundamental part that works by destroying Bitcoin is a bad idea to me.
If a 0.00000001 Satoshi has a value of $10 than we will have a problem to buy food. (it's an example)
I know that devs will be probably add a way to add more divisibility in the far future, but now there aren't other options.
I can see this way as a stress test for Bitcoin as it is now "Satoshidice", but destroying bitcoins isn't fondamental to make the project work, so I still think that it's better to find other solutions.
