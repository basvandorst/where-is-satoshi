Nice touch would be to support touchid as security feature :) but overall good job, you need some sale skills tho... Dont speak about age or downvotes, no added value in it :) 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:38:40

Error, that i shoupld check API or api status, my api status on hitbtc is ON, trading balance parmissions checked, i am sure my keys are correct, i tried to enter them once again but no go :) i wpuld not be surprised if it would be hitbtc fault, they have many problems :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:59:28
Oh nice, wasn't clear it would be touchid enabled, thats great :) 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:15:34

Brute forcing one word would be easy ...

Do you have ToMacco?

Not your keys, not your coins... Simple..

Omg i see past myself in him... Full of insecurities. It makes me want to help him find right way, but I would not let people help me in my past either... So... I dont know how to feel right now. Its a pity...

The efficiency is low, cost is high, thus the time for investment to return is much higher than investment to new mining rigs... So from financial standpoint, it does not make sense. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 18:38:05
Yeah he spent them all, people :) 
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:03:33
That last statement could be wrong. Fusion is known and have that potential of moving us to next level :)

Always wondered how this works... I tell him I want to pay using bitcoin, he gives me address (probably qr code?) and then we stare at eachother, waiting 20minutes for transaction to go through?

That server company, i was talking about, makes it using mineral oil bath in which the servers are and oil is transfering heat with only little loses into the heating system... And they are not even big, so much bigger mining farms could generate much more usable energy, i am not arguing with you, i am not into this much, i am just saying what is used here. Maybe the numbers wont add up
@_date: 2018-11-11 17:54:53
Yeah, thats a good point...

Why would be anyone buying Euro when Czech Crown is stronger every month and is actualy artificially weakened by Czech National Bank (but still let get stronger slowly)... Noone with clear mind would change Czech Crown for Euro, because it is 100% sure you will lose money on that transaction, so no wonder cryptos are more popular than fucking euro, because Czechs can count to five... Realy... Who does these surveys ffs?
@_date: 2018-02-27 10:16:55
because we want to keep our Czech Crown (its is strong and it is ours!), but we have to switch to Euro because we are in European Union and we are obliged to switch because of treaty we signed when joining the EU. We actually have delay with it. Because we love our currency. Most people hoping we wont do it.

Cool, seems reesonable. So it actually does not have the security advatage for the seller then. He needs to trust you.  Ok with the small amounts I think... 
@_date: 2018-02-17 13:16:36
:) actually, i am only telling you that it is possible to take heat and transfer it for kilometers using water... Yes, there would be losses, but still, big farms produce hell lot of a power going to waste
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:00:39
Yes, doesnt actualy mean anything, exchange rate of one unit is not what matters. Same as in cryptocurrency, one currency is not stronger just because one unit cost more.

I just asked, man. You "everything-is-FUD" people need to get back to reality a little bit...

Rembering a phrase like "i have very small penis" is easier than remembering eGfsDT4 IMO...
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:24:20
Where to look at it?

Paypal itself have 2%+ fees even for big players... How would they manage to have only 0.2%? i call bullshit

Server hosting firm is heating local swimming pool water in near town - so... It must be possible... at least for some cases and our nuclear plant is heating whole our town, 10km away, with water pipes going from plant to our town and to every household - how that works?

They told customers to do kyc asap, that after new year they will be locking accounts and delays may happen, yet, people did not do kyc asap and now everyone cries... 
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:03:54
This asumption is wrong, average user uses so much wallets through his life, that most of wallets needs to be empty, Its how that works... 
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:42:29
No, they just stopped holding it on fixed 27 but they still are interfering with the price big time. Get your facts straight... 
@_date: 2018-04-29 12:01:56
You see what happens when you have no way of regulation. In business, this would be case for big lawsuite, so nobody does it. Where this will lead, I dont want to know... 
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:21:44
Time to buy?
