I think you are in the wrong place... @_date: 2015-05-05 22:35:06
Can LE force a website to give someone's name and street address without specific information about the criminal investigation? From what I understand, they need to provide some evidence to get anything more than an IP address... maybe that's all they requested.
EDIT: And if they did this, I don't see why Coinbase wouldn't alert the user, like reddit does. So many questions...

I know that a lot of people have already answered your question, but I was just reading the Ross Ulbricht trial transcript from Thursday. It has some very good stuff.
The witness being questioned is the FBI agent who seized the Silk Road servers. On page 1660, the federal prosecutor began asking the agent to explain how bitcoin works. This should have lots of useful information about what the court (judge) might request clarification on and what the lawyers might ask you about.
Here are just a few of the page numbers for some of the topics that were discussed:






















There's a lot more good stuff in there, but I just wanted to list a few page numbers because it can be tedious to sort through court transcripts. Good luck!

Maybe I'm not understanding you, but how would LE find this person's address without triggering Coinbase to close the account? Wouldn't they have to go through Coinbase to get it, therefore alerting them of possible criminal activity?
