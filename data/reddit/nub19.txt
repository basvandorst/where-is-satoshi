I'll use my CC with cash back instead whilst I use BTC as a decentralized and censorship resistant store of value
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:40:13
As if the fact Brian Armstrong hates BTC couldn't be more obvious
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:34:36
IOTA is complete trash. Doesn't belong in the same sentence as Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:27:58
Don't risk buying one from a non authorized dealer. Check Ledger's official website
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:16:59
Bitcoin mining is not decentralized. Hopefully that improves over time
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:23:50
Buyer's fault for not buying from an authorized dealer
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:27:11
I agree with you. I just stated that IOTA was trash.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:11:25
Fair enough, but this is only because of low Segwit adoption and the current attack on the BTC network right now
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:21:12
Because no other cryptos have the volume BTC does. All would cripple
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:26:17
You paid way too much. Use a segwit wallet and underbid the fees
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:21:06
You are clueless. BitConnect is a ponzi scheme, Bitcoin is not.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:31:26
XRP is a bag of shit waiting to blow up. Bad advice

Decentralization. Ripple is in the same category as BTrash
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:08:13
Hard to do when it only has 8% adoption. If it was adopted, then yes, it would help a ton
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:03:24
I suggest you do the same :)
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:13:48
I agree that Bitcoin will survive.
I don't think it would have been as easy as exchanges calling Btrash- BTC. It would have been a complete shitshow.

A bubble doesn't burst and recover multiple times. The answer is no
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:12:51
Well, technically you don't own the private keys, they do. Invest in a hardware wallet or use a paper one.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:45:44
Okay, and noone knows what Bitcoin's actual intrinsic value is. Thanks for proving my point
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:00:06
It will become less volatile over time
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:44:28
Reward for those who HODLed while all the alts were pumping
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:16:23
Centralization is terrible and against what crypto is. There's no getting around that one
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:28:19
It's not a bubble
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:10:03
Armstrong must be in on the attack. Hella coordinated
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:18:07
Hardware wallet (Trezor/Ledger Nano S) or Electrum
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:43:18
I suggest you look up what a bubble actually means. You are the dumb one here.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:15:38
Everything you said is wrong. Look up the definition of a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:05:55
About time
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:35:10
Lmao. Fade this clown.
Check his post history, he's a BCH loser. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:10:36
Zoom out
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:14:43
This needs more upvotes
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:36:08
It most definitely is an attack. Jihan Wu controls a chunk of the BTC mining yet is invested in BCH. He is crippling the network right now
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:08:00
It's not baseless propaganda when Jihan has an invested stake in BCH. Conflict of interest. He's spamming the BTC network, collecting the fees, and profiting off the BCH/BTC pump and dump. Hell yeah I wish the mining of BTC would be more decentralized. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:19:27
Unconfirmed transactions skyrocketing and hashrate switching over to BCH. Add the fact that BTC dropping/BCH rising. Roger Ver AMA yesterday etc.
Pretty obvious it's an attack. This happened just over a month ago when BTC dropped to 3k and BCH skyrocketed. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:54:42
Then you can't say it's in a bubble, moron. Especially considering it has recovered after dozens of 'crashes'. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:06:54
Cut the bullshit. We all know he was spreading FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:07:45
Stahp. You've been bent over already
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:07:22
It will need to be groundbreakingly better in multiple aspects to overtake Bitcoin's network effect. 
See MySpace -&gt; Facebook. 
There really isn't any coin out there that can say that right now. Especially not when the Lightning Network is released and more exchanges adopt Segwit to reduce the wait/fees. 
Monero is one coin that has that potential, but that's about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:49:18
Can't be upvoted enough
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:27:19
give a shit about their own wallets, yes. 
Expect them to see a lawsuit their way in the future
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:47:04
Brian Armstong hates Bitcoin. I doubt they will support it ever.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:59:32
Use SegWit and undercut fees is the best thing people can do right now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:20:31
Coinbase adding BCH when BTCs mempool/tx fees are at an ATH with the network attack, BTC mining difficulty retarget period and right after a BCH bull run and BTC dip is way too much of a coincidence. Bunch of scammers
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:18:45
Agreed, but to be fair, so is IOTA. And it doesn't even work too boot (similar to ADA)
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:18:58
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:12:31
Centralized/Company has a ton of not yet circulated Ripple/Banks may not even use XRP when using the tech
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:24:30
I wouldn't be calling anyone anything when you're the one paying $1800 in fees lmao. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:02:59
How is this a shill post? Better than most of the other crap being posted
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:55:18
Pretty certain this is exactly what's happening right now. Hash rate also switching over to BCH
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:18:32
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:19:35
Are you not witnessing the attack on the network right now with skyrocketing fees and spam transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:58:55
Funny, I think you're dumber than dirt too. I guess we'll find out who's right down the road. 
Please short bitcoin if you think it's a bubble :)
Maybe you already did and are broke and taking your anger out in this sub. Strong possibility.
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:40:01
Look at the Ledger Nano S. Can store BTC/ETH/LTC among others in one wallet. If your wallet is stolen/you forget the PIN, you can recover your funds with the seed. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:43:01
Regardless of the amount you can put in, its a better investment than most things in this world imo
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:06:05
Yeah they did lie. They announced withdrawals only. Not buy/sell
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:20:43
How clueless are you? Coinbase and many other exchanges can enable SegWit and reduce the footprint on the mempool by a huge chunk. But they won't because they don't give a shit
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:23:13
Not surprising when Jihan controls most of the mining and he is invested in BCH. Talk about a conflict of interest
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:14:50
Another vote for QuadrigaCX here
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:07:31
Definitely an attack happening right now:
Unconfirmed transactions skyrocketing and hashrate switching over to BCH. Add the fact that BTC dropping/BCH rising. Roger Ver AMA yesterday etc.
These guys make it pretty obvious
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:17:00
Agreed. Use FIAT if you want coffee
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:15:17
Network under attack/high fees/delays. No other reason
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:23:56
Attack against BTC by Jihan and Co.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:22:40
Agreed. Monero has massive upside as the only legit privacy coin, and with a great dev team. Regulation risk is probably its only potential downfall. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:31:39
Great post. This should be upvoted more
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:58:52
Doubt it. Most people would have just exited crypto and it would have tanked. Who would have faith in something that could be taken down like that? Not me
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:31:16
I've read up plenty on it. It's completely centralized and Ripple owns a majority of the supply. They could cash in and flood the market, thereby devaluing the currency. You are at their mercy. They have even stated their currency should not be held as speculation. If i'm wrong, feel free to correct me
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:21:22
It's the timing and the execution that's pathetic. Adding it when BTC is at it's most vulnerable and after a BTrash price pump. Smells of an insider deal
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:06:01

They said withdrawal only (not buy/sell). And nice timing and execution to release it when BTC is very vulnerable and after a BCH pump. Insider trading to the max
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:05:09
Gtfoh. Roger Ver is a scammer and bitcoin.com is meant to manipulate and misinform newbies.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:29:05
I agree. I'm saying it would have been much less obvious (of a pump and dump) if they pumped a coin like LTC instead of a shitcoin BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:35:09
BCH will get dumped hard and everyone holding it will be left with a bag of shit. Just wait for it
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:14:44
Moreso that it's failed as a cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:27:29
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:44:08
I think people are just chasing the pump. When the inevitable dump happens, the chasers will be left holding a bag of shit imo
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:52:29
Good lucky buddy, hope it gets resolved soon. Lawyer up!

@_date: 2017-11-12 21:37:35
Why not pump LTC then? BCH is complete trash as a currency
