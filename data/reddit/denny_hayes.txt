Well the perception other people have of you changes a lot when you are wearing a nice suit which you can afford because of bitcoin.

But it has gone up over a 150 dollars in less than one week. That'd be ~$15,000. Why do you asume this talk is only about a 14 dollar movement?

If I got rich I'd probably use the money to study philosophy at the best place I could get into.

I guess that's what normal jobs do (plus the surplus value thats taken from you), but here we are talking bout bitcoin. 
You mentioned you were into gold before, isn't it essentially the same thing? Save from the fact that gold can be used for jewellery, but that is hardly utility.

I mean if people would be able to know the future price of Bitcoin or of anything, they could easily become rich no problem.

A bit of circularity there, eh? It has value because they are mining it, and they are mining because it has value?
It has value because there's demand, that's all there's to it. Now there can be demand either because people think they can sell it at a higher price later, or because they think they can use it as actual currency.

It'd be too complicated to get into value theory now, but if you ask me why I bought, well, just because I think it can be worth more in the future, and I think I'm certainly not alone in that, but also I'm not like a die hard supporter of bitcoin, I just realise we live in an economy where capital creates more capital. 
However in this case, it is not creating any; any money I make will simply be money I take from some other guy in my same situation. It's a sort of a game really. I realise we are not producing anything. Just wasting electricity.
Now why do I think it will go up in price? Well because at least for a while to come, I believe more people will enter the market, and bitcoin is scarce. But at certain point it is all just a hunch, and I might lose money but then again, so can any investment.

Most hodlers are basically long term traders looking for a "slow" buck. Most fellows aren't thinking "oh I will be able to use bitcoin as a currency in the future", they are thinking "I will get a good profit if I invest for 2 years". 
The only difference between hodlers and short term traders is that since the price seems to go up steadily over time, hodling for a long period is less of a gamble, BUT STILL, it IS a gamble, because nothing assures you the rising trend will actually keep on forever, it is just a possibility.

No, Gold is a metal, it shines and can be used for jewellery, and some other few things, but that's it. It stopped being money decades ago.

Also, you'll notice people are overly positive about bitcoin in these forums; they have to be, because being positive about bitcoin actually makes them money by attracting more people into it. So yeah, Its kinda against my own interest and theirs for me to make these type of comments.

Does look sorta neutral, but I see this comic pop up everywhere all the time and often times the content of the comic gives away that she is a woman.

This is amazing hahaha!

It is a meme that started from a typo of hold long ago. It's just the way bitcoin people say "hold".

In order to spend the goddamn money

To be honest they are all kinda bad, in all cases you are making money from money without any substantial work. Bitcoin doesn't even produce anything, or has any kind of use value. I buy it anyways but I ain't gonna pretend this is particularly "respectable". I'm a capitalist pig.
