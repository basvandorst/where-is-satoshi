i Agree with you, 
@_date: 2016-04-22 03:08:30
a professional attack would be at a exchange, with over 2,500+BTC.
bitstamp, bitfinex,Okcoin,BTCe, etc. 
all have been hacked at least once with lost much over 2,500BTC. 
i can tell you right now, that anyone who invested alot $$$$ in BTC will have BTC hardware wallet. 
so this person dont have much money invested or he is dumb or his post is BS with malware ready to steal ur BTC once you click on link, etc. 
 
@_date: 2016-04-21 04:26:37
this is where hardware wallet gets handle. 
protect you from these type of amateurs attacks that could of been prevented. 
@_date: 2016-04-06 23:41:55
be-careful, if you unload alot of BTC on that accont and try to sell all that on one go. they still have the power to put your Money on HOLD for further investigation. just dont be surprise when they do. 
however with a private seller on Location Bitcoins, very less likely that it could happen.

@_date: 2016-04-25 03:48:47
i heard that same thing in 2012, again with 2013. 
inflation alone is gonna kill you in 10 years. 
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:02:48
considering it 4cents, then that would be around 4%. kinda of expensive do ya think?
i know on larger amount its still 4 penny. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 23:40:13

@_date: 2017-02-17 21:37:22

@_date: 2017-02-22 18:55:17
just wait when BTC hit 3-5k and both russia, China will ban it just so they can pick up cheapies 
@_date: 2017-02-05 18:33:49
They have to battle it out in Court, to Proof that it is ours.
even if they manage to Proof that it is ours after 1-2years in Court. 
alot of things can happen, like a hacker magically stolen all your BTC and convert it into ZCash/Monero. so what they are going to do then? its not efficient for them to try and confiscate Crypto.    
 
@_date: 2016-03-19 06:02:50
there might could be a possibility, if its run on top of BTC or LTC, but we will see. anything is possible. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 19:06:26
ONLY when u Cash out and buy a BIG HOUSE, Fancy Car, Massive Yacht etc. 
but if you cash out via Cash, and buy anything that accept cash with no question ask your SOLID. new Iphone,Ipad,Laptop,Rent, etc.

@_date: 2016-03-24 04:11:22
9 more days until April, so we will see how much of a txn increase we will get with SegWit. 
anywhere from 50%-200%, as mention by core. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 04:00:26
i buy bitcoin from circle and as soon as i get them i LOAD them into my Trezor, ASAP. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 04:51:20

@_date: 2016-03-24 17:16:59
about 8 more days before april 01
@_date: 2016-03-21 03:19:11
why wont you just hold the bitcoin on hardware wallet?

that is why there is DASH to use. 
@_date: 2016-03-20 04:04:34
there is just require alot of knowledge 
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:21:18
There isnt a Direct Connect, this was just to show how shady they can be in there own Organization. They lost alot of Data and yet they expect coinbase to have all user data, want everyone data. 
@_date: 2016-03-23 06:10:06
he know something we dont
that is why he is so chill
@_date: 2016-03-20 18:31:04
Attach a Tracking Transaction? what is that suppose to mean 
@_date: 2017-02-17 21:34:56
not many are happy about these ATM they ask for too much info. ID, KYC, etc. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 05:34:01
its FREEDOM old man 
@_date: 2016-03-07 05:07:18
even a big spam cost a pretty penny, esp a paid one to try and push other to bid a higher transcation fee inorder to get processed. 
 they failed crash BTC [-25% to -50%] so it wasnt worth time. it wasnt getting them the ROI they were looking for.
i think now they would be saving up there money, waiting for the prefect timing and try again.  this next time, when will need more resource for the same effect because once SegWit is deploy transaction capacity increase anywhere from 50% to 200%. only in april we would find out. 
@_date: 2016-03-10 00:22:40
Wrong you should read the white papper.
if order to trace one transcation you must own 85-95% of all the Masternode. each Masternode will require 1,000 DASH to start one. there are ~3,500 total Masternode. at todays current price you will need $4,500 USD to start a new Masternode. while doing so the price of the next Dash will cost more than the next. good luck.
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:01:45
why waste money to sue people? when you can just move on into a different Coin. 
can be resolved Faster
@_date: 2017-02-07 07:11:59

@_date: 2016-06-05 18:53:39
i see so the government is scared that people will run away from there fiat with higher inflation rate. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 19:07:53

@_date: 2016-06-12 03:27:07
if he got more BTC at $200-300, he would be doing really good right now. see the highest ROI of 2016, considering alot of stocks took a drive. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 19:49:48
what does this even mean?
@_date: 2016-06-07 05:21:52

Verification procedures:
- phone number for operations over $1000
what happen if i do alot of 750$ X 5 transaction, does this means i dont need to give up my Phone# or ID of anykind  ?
all of the BTC Atm is california/USA require Phone# or ID, for any transaction. as far as i know.
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:28:08
was this underCover federal agent on LocalBitcoins ?
to be safe only Trade with people Over 500+ transaction on LocalBitcoins.  also make sure this account was created years ago.  it does reduces your risk massively.

i agree , tokyopotato is very naive. 
this is the very same reason why Russian hackers were able to hack Hillary Clinton email. the hackers know there is a backdoor, its a matter of finding where it is.
