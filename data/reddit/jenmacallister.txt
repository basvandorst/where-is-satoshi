The corporations are already global and work better, time for the money to do that too...

There is never any reason to have more money than you will ever need. The average person making around $50,000 a year will only make about 2.8 million in their entire lifetime of work. Why would most,ever need more money than that? Make your the money you need to set yourself up financially and then get out.
