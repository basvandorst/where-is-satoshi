That's why the double spend attacks are directed to services.  Deposit, exchange, withdraw new BTC or alts, and the only person "losing the coins" as the network comes to a consensus is the exchange itself.  The threat is very real even below 50%.
Also, your argumentation would improve significantly if you didn't resort to ad hominem

You describe a fascinating possibility but should that reality of a BMM cartel come to fruition I have no doubt that it would unravel the coin itself. 
Driven by profit, the BMM would be reassuring the public that they have no attempts to double spend or cause malicious harm.  Slowly but surely, power would corrupt even under the best of intentions. 
They may begin with a policy of refunding erroneously large mining fees.  Obviously mistakes right?
Then their actions would go further, they would become the point of contact for any "mistake" in the blockchain.  From accidental coin loss, to theft, to bitcoins that needed to be seized by legal institutions.  A central point of control means outside forces could put pressure on the BMM to influence, freeze transactions as someone else sees fit.  After all, a power hungry enterprise needs money to keep the lights on.
They may begin to realize that they don't have to actually support all their legions of miners.  They may begin rationing for the "privilege" of getting to mine in the BMM, because less miners overall means proportionally bigger payouts for everyone else left inside.
The BMM would gain an enormously influential position insofar as bitcoin development, because any update or hard fork would be enforced by their miners, and theirs alone.  
In the end, they would be acting no different from a federal reserve, but infinitely worse.  They would have complete and total control over the blockchain and the funds moving within it. 
The reason why this nightmare scenario is unlikely, is because cryptocurrency users always have a choice.  People like to dismiss and deride alt coins for their mere existence, but it's actually a good idea to have a backup at hand.  Their presence alone makes the entire *concept* of decentralized currency stronger by making sure we don't have to rely on one version of it, should it fail.  
In the face of a BMM, bitcoin users would either flee to the alts, or fork the code, revert to a prior block before the BMM took over, and begin a rogue anti-BMM version of the currency that attempts to exclude monopolistic ownership.  Messy, but possible.
What a time to be alive.

It sounds like he's flogging a competitor because he's trying to launch his own service.  More power to him if he wants to try, but his claims still don't hold water. 
Coinbase shares none of the characteristics of a Ponzi scheme.  They make their money off of merchant and order fees, not user deposits.  Unlike MtGox, they've never had restrictions on the amount or frequency of bitcoins you can withdraw, and even offer tools like paper wallets to make it easier.

Hi, OP here.  It's a joke.
@_date: 2014-06-03 19:45:29
Yeah, in the early days there were quite a few stumbles that led to more coins being mined than expected.  This is where the accusations of "instamine" come from.  The "emission curve" graph you're referencing is a result of the decision to change the reward rates to their current form.  After about a month the block rewards solidified into their current form.
Evan [made a detailed post explaining what happened at the beginning](  At the time, Darkcoin was still dirt cheap and the early adopters (myself included) were selling thousands of them for less than 0.0012 BTC apiece.  We had no idea it would explode in price.  I remember him saying:


The graph referenced in the whitepaper is correct, and the network is on track to produce about 22 million dark in the decades to come.   
Unlike bitcoin, which already has more than half of its coinbase mined, Darkcoin still has 80% to go.

If you really want to know what separates Dark from Bitcoin, fine. "On a technical level Darkcoin features several differences compared to Bitcoin:
* practically anonymous money transfers through a decentralized Coinjoin-based mixing service called DarkSend (in beta development as of March 2014),
* a unique and highly secure Proof of Work (PoW) hashing algorithm (X11) based on a chain of 11 different types of hashes,
* a deflationary block reward scheme (~22 million coins max) where block reward is reduced as the hashing power escalates,
* two-layered ASIC resistance as a result of X11 and the diminishing-reward formula,
* faster confirmation times (2.5 minutes on average, instead of 10 minutes of Bitcoin),
* the Dark Gravity Wave difficulty adjustment algorithm for quickly adjusting to large fluctuations in the mining power of the network,
a gradual block reward reduction of ~7% per year,
* masternode payments, a way to earn 10% of new blocks by providing nodes for DarkSend's operation (requires 1000 DRK per node)."

If you send bitcoin to an address located at an exchange, the exchange will basically control and manage the bitcoins for you so long as they exist there. 
Copying and pasting the public address elsewhere does nothing - the bitcoins still exist within that exchange.  
In order to move bitcoins to a new address/service/location, you have to create a transaction that will withdraw them to somewhere else (a new address, preferably in a wallet you control) 
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:59:04

Bitcoin transactions are generally public, and it's possible to trace someone's identity on the network, especially if they use an exchange. 
Bitcoin users *can* use extra tools to try to be anonymous, but this typically involves trusting another 3rd party, and/or paying them a fee for this service.  More trustless privacy features for bitcoin are likely on the horizon.
Darkcoin allows trustless private transactions straight from the native wallet as a standard option. 
It also has a system which rewards those who run nodes. 
It also has a much more gradual reward rate reduction at 7% per year, instead of 50% every 4 years seen with bitcoin. 
It's X11 algorithm uses eleven different hashing scripts.  There are no ASICs developed for it yet, and it uses less power and graphics cards run cooler while mining it. 
No coin is perfect, and I'm not saying you should invest in anything, but these are some of the main characteristics which differentiate darkcoin from bitcoin
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:48:09

It's really quite sad that you're grasping at straws now.  Eleuthria isn't explaining that the &gt;50% attack isn't real, nor is he refuting the idea that pools with significant hash rate can do damage to exchanges.  Both of those are very real and present possibilities. 
No, Eleuthria is ranting about how inaccurate  and unreliable blockchain.info's charts are, especially under a 24-hour time span.
Please by all means, ask him whether it's possible for someone with a high hash rate to steal large amounts of money from an exchange via double spend, especially when the exchange credits the balance after 3 confirms.

Yes, it can cause automated loss of funds by itself if a service did not have the foresight to account for these exceptions, and included an automatic retry mechanism.  That's the problem.  Not so much with bitcoin itself, but how these services handle it and created their own custom rules for recording payments as complete.
Bad example: "Does transaction appear in blockchain?  If yes, deduct balance from customers wallet.  If no, retry."
The outcome of this would be catastrophic, and hindsight is not the kindest teacher with bitcoin.  All that being said, I have no opinion on who caused this attack or how, but it is possible to lose funds via this method.

It sounds like you may be using bitcoin for the wrong reasons.  It is not a get rich quick scheme or a guaranteed investment.  In fact, buying any significant portion of bitcoin isn't necessarily recommended for everyone either.  
Can bitcoin go up by 100 fold in a year? Yup.  Can it drop by 50% in a week? Definitely. 
If you want an altcoin to steadily resist market forces, it's probably not going  to have a fixed total supply to begin with.  In that case, it'll be pretty bland and boring price wise, but function much the same.

Interesting.  You would just need a system where people can aggregate, vote on, and show support for ideas instead of people.  
It' going to be hard to come up with a system that is able to uniquely identify one person with one vote, so I imagine devs would gravitate towards the "money talks" theory, and just let those with the most BTC spend their money where they please.

Dude, when you send bitcoin to a paper wallet it's publicly recorded for all to see.  They don't have to "generate" the same address on their end.  You made it, you sent funds to it, and that information will remain out there and available in the databases that reach consensus on the network.  What's different is that it's not connected to your identity at all unless you tell people
@_date: 2014-06-14 03:46:00

Maybe you've seen so many false uncertainties that you can't even recognize real risk when it's staring you in the face. 
You're so consumed with the idea of argumentative superiority that you've missed the point, again: I'm not talking about the "51%" terror that you refer to.  I'm talking about what someone with a &lt;50%, but still significant percentage of the network hashrate is capable of.  
You can say things like 
"You have no idea what you are talking about"
But that doesn't actually back up your position, or do anything to disprove that what I'm saying is essentially very correct.  
All you're doing is spouting off a stream of noiseless verbiage like a pissed off playground bully throwing a tantrum when he can't form a coherent argument.  If you can somehow show that exchanges are invulnerable to double spends in the manner that I've described, then by all means come out of your shell and join the conversation like an adult.

@_date: 2014-04-04 13:35:07
Remember that you technically sent the coins to a specific address in your wallet.  Regardless of whether your local receiving wallet is synced or not, the network as a whole has already reached a consensus that the bitcoins exist at that specific address.
Heed the advice of the others to simply show the private key of that address, and import the bitcoins somewhere else.  You can spend them immediately if you need to, or send them back to the wallet once it's synced

@_date: 2014-06-03 15:39:57
The real answer is "it depends"
A big reason why credit cards come attached with so many fees is because of chargeback fraud.  But bitcoin payments can't be reversed, so if people are funding their cards with bitcoin, then the payment processor has no fear of losing money.  The payments arrive faster and have inherently lower fees to begin with, so the entire conversion process could be done for very cheap. Or the consumer would pay no conversion cost at all if it's covered by the merchant, or built in using exchange rates.

If you have a preconceived notion that electronic money is "bad," you will be biased in your search to gather facts.  
It is better to start with no opinion at all, and simply pose the question "Is electronic money useful/good/effective/better than X?"
Then after you gather the evidence, you will be able to form or withhold an opinion based on better judgement. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:26:21
I helped design dark.  So let me clear up a few misconceptions: 
* The Coinjoin tech is built straight into the native  QT client, which means you're never needing to trust (or pay extra) for a 3rd party service to mix the coins
* Unlike bitcoin, the decision was made to pay node operators as well as miners.  If your node is randomly selected to transmit the block, you receive 10% of the reward.  You need to simply hold 1000 DRK in the node for it to participate, meaning it is impossibly difficult for a malicious 3rd party to set up a majority of nodes on the network. 
* It uses X11 as a hashing algorithm, which introduces ASIC resistance for the time being.  Your mining cards will also run cooler than other hashing algorithms, and a recent software update has allowed Nvidia cards to perform almost on par with AMD
* Instead of experiencing a reward halving rate every 4 years, darkcoin is designed with a much more gradual 7% reduction in reward rate annually.  It will taper off to just over 21,000,000 coins in the decades to come.  
I currently (regretfully) do not hold any darkcoin at the moment.  I sold my initial stake in the early days and it continued to take off.  I really did not think, and still do not think, that darkcoin is destined for mainstream use simply by virtue of it's name.  However, it may reach an extremely wide audience and the coin itself is capable of making improvements that bitcoin simply cannot anymore.  It may also help legitimize the bitcoin community by striking a contrast.  
@_date: 2014-05-25 21:04:44
Fantastic, so you have no ground to stand on when trying to debunk the points that make darkcoin different.  
Original post is still factual by the way.   There's nothing exceptionally perfect about 1 confirmation every 10 minutes.  We could imagine a coin that has 1 confirmation every hour, and it would suck.  The fact of the matter remains that I can transfer DRK to an exchange and still see it ready for trading faster than BTC.  The darcoin difficulty also re-targets every block instead of every 2 weeks with BTC, which means more consistent confirmation times and it eliminates the risks caused by sudden drastic changes in network hashrate.
The deflationary aspects of darkcoin are much smoother and gentler than the harsh 50% drops every 4 years with bitcoin.  7% annual reductions lead to less volatility and more gradual change.
Again, I'm not here to convince you of anything.  Good day. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:22:32

I get what you're saying, and you're correct.  
But if I've got 49% of the network hashrate, I've already got a decent chance of pulling off a double spend, especially if I'm allowed to attempt it multiple times on a service.  (i.e. depositing bitcoin to sell into an exchange that only waits for 3 confirmations)
A malicious actor could: 
1) Send their BTC into a multi-cryptocurrency exchange.  
2) Wait for it to confirm, while secretly mining a longer chain
3) As their deposit clears, they could immediately sell all the BTC for an altcoin, and withdraw it. 
4) Then they publish their secretly mined version of the blockchain which is longer, and shows 
that they never sent BTC into the exchange in the first place. Now they have their BTC, and an altcoin too.  
5) Sell the alt for BTC, rinse and repeat with new exchanges and accounts.

It is possible to steal funds, but not from addresses or wallets themselves, from a service. 
It's more correct to say that transaction malleability is necessary, but not sufficient enough to do this.  In addition, you also need to convince a bitcoin service running a poorly coded implementation of the wallet that they need to retry their withdrawal.  In some cases this would have involved social engineering attacks with customer support person, and in other cases it would be completely automated by whatever 3rd party system failed to take this into account.
