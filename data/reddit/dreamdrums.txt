As much as I think your statement could be correct, do you have any hard evidence to support it?
You do sound unequivocal....
@_date: 2019-11-23 11:27:16

Well there is 50 minutes I'll never get back. Surely there are many factors about Bitcoin which weren't even touched on, the most important being decentralisation.

Use it all the time, not for large withdrawals though. Most of mine are under $200. I'm sure they will have the information you're after on their site. It's the best exchange for a coin I'm into.

He's a terrible communicator.

This is good advice if you're coming in with USD and the alt is the fiat value you want to purchase at. If you hold BTC already then I feel you want to watch Satoshi value.
However, if you're looking at buying Ether - Satoshi value is quite low but USD price has substantially risen. 
It all depends on your end game, whether you want to hold more BTC or USD or in this case even Ether. 
Hope this makes sense

But how much will that $30 be after sending fees?
