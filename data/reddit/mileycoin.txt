Barry Silbert is a strange man.

And only being disputed by people with agendas. Look at your post history, you're the BU shill who cries about censorship on every opportunity you get.

A friend who works in a restaurant and knows i'm into crypto just linked this promo video to me and said they're going to start trialing the crypto payments at their joint. They have sales &amp; payments on both mobile and counter terminals.
What do you guys think?
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:17:08
*facepalm*. Here it is folks, the logic of a \r\btc BU supporter who screams "censorship" (I checked your post history) at every opportunity.
@_date: 2019-11-29 03:52:36
Yeah I'm not sure how they do it either but it sounds amazing, instant payments with zero fees, and without using 0 confirmation transactions. Does this mean they're eating the Bitcoin fees as a business model? Makes me wonder how they can remain profitable though, if fees go up. For example if you're buying a $2 drink and the fee cost, say, $1. Or say the network usage spikes and the fee costs over $2... From what I can see it lets you use any crypto wallet.

My bad, it turns out this PoS device is actually only for a different crypto. Someone else in the thread linked all the details.
@_date: 2017-04-20 02:12:12
Apparently desiring evidence makes you an idiot.
@_date: 2017-04-21 12:31:32
Your post reeks of jealousy my man. We get it, you're jealous because LTC is going to activate SegWit and Lightning Network probably a whole year or two before Bitcoin does. But, that's no reason to be absurd. Litecoin supporters are also Bitcoin supporters, and most Litecoin supporters own both coins. We want what's best for both coins. Please, elaborate on how "jihan now controls litecoin" and "litecoin is under control by a jihan government"? Time to loosen the tinfoil hat... You realize Bitcoin has these same meetings right? Ever heard of the Bitcoin Roundtable? The only difference here is that the devs are actually keeping their word...
@_date: 2017-04-20 02:38:02
Yep, I got one too. Someone definitely has an email/password dump from somewhere. This is why you don't reuse passwords.
@_date: 2017-04-21 12:35:09
Don't expect a genuine reply. UKcoin is irrationally bitter for some odd reason. All he's doing is throwing around tinfoil accusations without actually backing them up. Probably comes from rbtc or something.
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:21:00
Hahaha, woah. Sounds like someone has had too many bongs. Is Jihan the Litecoin Illuminati?

@_date: 2017-05-29 02:52:08
That's a shame. I can't take people seriously when they can't see what's been in front of their faces for years.
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:17:32
Uhmm, what? You're the one twisting his words, and you're 100% wrong. He IS saying that he's against lower fees. He's making MILLIONS of dollars off high fees, of course he is against them. Anyone with a brain can see that.


Complete nonsense fabrication. 


I'm not surprised. You smell like a shill. You're pretty active on rbtc too, what a surprise.
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:57:15
What's the whole story here? I doubt it's simply a case of trying to scam you, considering your trade was "low volume" and he could have scammed a high volume trade instead.
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:21:36
You thought that? Of course not, pay attention, why would he be against something that is making him millions of dollars. It's called smoke and mirrors.
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:20:26
Hahahahahahahaha. You're in need of a reality check. Block subsidy is a tiny fraction of his reward, the majority is fees.
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:22:38
Because he's not saying that at all, he's saying his profits are going to be diminished once the fee market dies. Also, who cares if non-segwit transactions are expensive, the entire point of segwit is to use it.
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:53:26


Do you? I don't need a link. It's called math. Try it. 12.5bitcoins = 28k USD, your math is wrong, that's far lower than the transaction fee reward and you'd also need to offset the cost of mining.
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:19:18
Wrong. He's saying that he won't be making millions of dollars off a fee market if SegWit activates. Stop trying to twist his words.
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:56:53
The minority chain as in the UASF chain? Okay, thanks. You so smert.
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:58:51


Not really. They're idealists, and what's worse, going down the same road we're going down with no end in sight or actually taking some action to change it? Besides, if enough of the ecosystem commits to BIP148 then it will not be hostile or dangerous at all, it will be a success. Really we need exchanges to step up and voice support.
@_date: 2017-06-04 07:04:22
Toot! Toot!
@_date: 2017-06-05 01:37:43
So can someone explain why the soft fork isn't a hard fork? 
Because: Say 30% of the nodes see a black tie and reject it because it's not red, and 70% see a black tie and let it through because there's a tie, wouldn't that then cause a chain split by that 30% of nodes and they would be on a different chain?
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:19:24
Localbitcoins should reprompt for password when generating an API key so that this is not possible. This is a security hole in their design. Thanks for the analysis.
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:56:24
Yeah, they don't even know what they're saying. Clowns.
@_date: 2017-06-04 02:55:10
That really depends on the distribution of miners, no?
@_date: 2017-06-05 01:03:17


I think it's the opposite actually. I think anti-UASF people are posting a lot and most UASF supporters are keeping quiet. There are businesses coming out in support of BIP148. Just look at the front page. Get over it.
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:49:25
Dude, you sound really clueless. Not sure why you're making demands from people who understand the process.
@_date: 2017-06-04 11:02:51
They can start mining on a BIP148 pool ahead of time to show support, and switch back if it does not gain significant support. They won't lose anything in that case. 


Some already have. Over 3% of the network and it's only been a few days of these pools in operation.
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:50:46
Yeah, 3%, but it's only been 3 days... Are you special? It's only just getting started.
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:48:07
If you clicked a bookmarklet and it asked for your password I think most users would be pretty suspicious... I hope.
@_date: 2017-06-04 09:21:37
This isn't my pool, just saw it and wanted to share it. 
There's also these two pools as well:
Perhaps slushpool is a better bet? Has a 2% fee though.
Anyway, main point was just to show people that there are pools out there for signalling BIP148 support now.
@_date: 2017-06-04 11:41:07
I don't think you understand how mining works.
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:55:29
Semantically correct, however any miner supporting SegWit WILL make that switch, since they support SegWit...
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:17:27
Ah I didn't see that it required a bookmarklet. You're right. Nevertheless, from the response below, the JavaScript apparently generates an API key for your Localbitcoins account. This should not be possible, Localbitcoins should be reprompting for password for this sort of an operation, so it's still a flaw in their security.
@_date: 2017-06-04 09:27:54
Are you saying they stole coins from your localbitcoins wallet? This sounds like a vulnerability on the localbitcoins website, you should email their support, this shouldn't be possible. Sounds like a XSRF attack/exploit.
@_date: 2017-06-04 11:01:09
Nope, there are plenty of people in the industry who have voiced support, feel free to live in denial though.
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:48:01
Uh, SegWit can be activated in the proper way of miners stop being dicks, with no risk or loss to them at all, so yeah, this is what happens when you're being uncooperative. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:26:43
You sound like a scared big blocker.
