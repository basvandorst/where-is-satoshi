i am glad i started to get into it when i did. I do recall the days when thousands were worth damn near nothing. sad i didn't get into it way back when...

hahaha this is awesome. yeah i think it will dip a bit before we see 9. last night it dipped way down into the 7000s but broke back out into the 8's today. The dips seem to be getting smaller though. as long as there are no more stupid forks coming

Oh I know. I remember when they accepted Bitcoin for pizzas. I was just assuming since you spent his last $20 that meant he was doing everything with Bitcoin now. Obviously you need to spend in order to survive

would like to see some competition for bitmain. would like to actually know they are legit before getting one but if they are able to keep up with demand and actually deliver, i am in on a bunch of these

Congrats! i think there are still some major gains to be had but hey, as long as you are happy and can live off it... more power to you! can't say i blame you one bit!

nothing wrong with the slingshot though. they are hella fast. and certainly turn heads far more than anything else i've seen in quite some time. love the color combo too. sadly, i wish i had invested a lot of what i waste money on in bitcoin instead. would be far better off

Didn't really look at many of the comments but hopefully he kept track of them and where they are. There was news today of a missing hard drive with 7k bitcoin floating around somewhere. im sure its been destroyed at this point and its just millions of dollars gone. so props to him if he still actually has them

congrats! Are you now living solely on bitcoin? like buying everything with bitcoin and such? Or are you stuck converting to fiat to buy stuff still?

My thought exactly. Get in early on pre-orders
