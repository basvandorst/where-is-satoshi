But I'm guessing the OP has so much that cashing out $1,000 at a time would take him twice his lifetime. When you have these quantities, I guess you aim to spend it in bigger things.

Completely agree, plus take in account that the 2% of inflation is just "alleged". They normally remove certain type of goods from the calculation to make it look stable.
(And this calculation is just taken from the price rise, instead of from the real quantitative-easing increase; which means that this amount is lower than the real one because the prices-raising-rate is just a side-effect; read more about this by researching the 'Cantillon' effect.)

this doesn't matter; let's say the limit is 10 bitcoins instead of 21million; if you transfer 6 bitcoins out of your address, someone sends them back to you, and you transfer them out again, then it's already 12 bitcoins that passed through that address (higher than the limit)

I could go on an on all day telling you arguments of how bitcoin will become mainstream, just because it's safer than creditcards or cash, easier to use than creditcards, easier to carry/store than gold, easier to manage for travellers (instead of changing currency each time they hop into a new country), cheaper for merchants, etc etc.
But I'm going to refrain from that because I don't have all afternoon. I'm just going to tell you the opposite, instead of highlighting why it's going to mainstream, I'm just going to point out the 2 reasons why it's impossible that it doesn't go to mainstream:
1) People's greed.
2) Politicians' and bankers' greed.
What do I mean by this? When BTC raises in value, many people believe that it's just because there's more demand than supply. But that's the direct reason. There's a bigger reason of why there's more demand than supply and why there will always be: most of the time when BTC raises, it's not actually that BTC raises, it's simply that fiat goes down. Why? Because if you keep printing artificially an asset, that asset keeps growing indefinitely, and therefore its value goes down. If fiat goes down, BTC goes up, simple mathematics. Politicians' and governments' will always be greedy, therefore they will always be printing money (and bankers will always be granting loans with fractional reserve, which is virtually the same thing as creating fiat money from thin air); therefore, fiat money will keep going down as it has done in the last decades. The effect of this is that bitcoin will continually go up. And because of people's greed (see why google trends for bitcoin only rise when it actually goes up, instead of what they should be doing which is buying the dip) then this is a reinforcing loop that will make fiat money bite the dust (because people will start realising that having your savings in fiat money is stupid, and because of greed, they will keep increasing their percentage exposure to BTC when diversifying assets and see that it pays off).
But if you want a purely more mathematical answer, I'll give it to you to: you know that bitcoin cuts its supply in half every 4 years, right? Well, then, the only way for bitcoin to go down on value in the long term is if, every 4 years, bitcoin stopped being used/bought half the people that were using it 4 years earlier. How can this be possible if the actual usage is even increasing, not decreasing? Do your math. And it always increases its usage because it's a new technology, like the internet, that people are continually learning about.
And to finish: it's a bit dumb of you to jump into conclusions about me thinking that I deem tax as theft and all that bullshit. That sounds like you were 12 years old, buddy. Maybe I'm an exception because I'm not a libertarian, I only praise bitcoin for its technological advancements over other currencies and asset classes. I don't think tax is theft, but I think inflation is.
Have a good day.

Hahaha now I realised that replying to you was a waste of time, you seem completely convinced yourself by your arguments and need hell of a lot of knowledge to break from there. I don't have enough time just for you. Good luck out there.
@_date: 2019-05-22 08:39:02
I'm sorry but this is bullshit, and I'm going to try to explain why.
The only reason of why you think BTC is volatile and USD is not, is because you're looking at the value of BTC in USD. You can quickly inverse this and change your point of view completely: how about you measure the price of USD in BTC? Then your conclusion would be that USD is widely volatile (and always losing value in the long term) while BTC is very stable.
So then you have to ask yourself the question: why do I measure BTC in USD instead of USD in BTC? Because USD is the status quo, it's what you use to pay for things daily, it's what your salary comes in. But, my friend, this is easier to change than you think. I was born in Europe myself, and before the euro existed, I only knew about my local currency. When I was 18 y.o. the EUR didn't exist yet, and 20 years later, if you ask me how much 1,000 units of my local currency are in euros, I have to really think very hard about this.
This means, that it's not too crazy to think that, if people continue seeing value in a deflationary currency like BTC, it may well be the currency that all the planet uses for everything, not very far in the future (5, 10 years?). Then, when you start thinking about BTC and USD, you will know how much is a BTC, and will forget how many USD does a BTC hold. Because your salary will come in BTC, your coffee you will pay it in BTC, and so on and so forth.
