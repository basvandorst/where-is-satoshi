@_date: 2014-02-25 00:20:54
something about mtgox
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:36:40
Well he did it for me, I searched around and there didn't seem to be any easy way to brute force multibit wallets, besides when you get a haircut, who do you thank? The scissors or the hairdresser?

Nope it's clearly a dishwasher
@_date: 2014-06-19 03:47:39
How big is this bowl compared to the super bowl?
@_date: 2014-04-15 22:39:37
Some people in here are harsh :)
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:54:46
Thanks mate, I'll look into that!
@_date: 2014-04-09 21:05:16
Gratz on the neckbeard.

Typo when I typed it in, and it was in a password with 14 letters in upper and lower case.

Requiescat in pace.

I have the strangest boner right now, and it feels like this whole ordeal will end with a severe case of blueballs. I don't even dare to hope, please let this go to the moon. Pretty please.
@_date: 2014-01-06 00:51:51
I think that I will still need the encryption password :s
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:01:24
Argh c'mon enough with the pdf's &gt;.&lt;
@_date: 2014-03-02 15:52:59
Tits or ass?
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:07:55
Mass adoption will not come untill it is though.
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:48:58
Yes he did (and i knew what the password was supposed to be, only that i had a w instead of a e in one position &gt;.&gt;)
@_date: 2014-02-08 10:58:45
Damnit. I wish i had some bitcoins,  doge can send the jamaican bobsled team to the olympics, but we could send her to college :D
@_date: 2014-02-09 09:28:23
Go forth.
@_date: 2014-02-17 17:23:31
Holy shit it feels like I just entered a cheat code. I might have to steal this.
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:20:00
hehe... tried around 50 variations, one of them was with capslock on.
@_date: 2014-06-19 03:43:32
@_date: 2014-03-01 16:29:26
It's pronounced doge.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:40:34
Great initiative, i'll chip in when i get home.
@_date: 2014-04-15 11:18:27
I think it has more to do with the stance that apple took when it comes to wallet apps.
@_date: 2014-02-08 11:26:52
Well since I am still feeling very grateful to Dave for saving my bitcoins about a month ago I just have to chime in and say that his service rocks. (But one should always be careful with their coins)
@_date: 2014-10-22 19:40:54
Dude! Shhh!
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:24:49
Holy shit, is it a coincidence that the owner of Virgin lives there? My mind just blew the fuck up.
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:50:08
Ofcourse not, and I'm sure it's not so easy, but since it's a typo I figured there might be some way to find it. (14 characters, and I know what the pw was meant to be, but somehow a typo was made.. )

The league community, much like the rest of the world consists of people who don't think for themselves. This is exactly what I expect from league players. (It's also a very "toxic" community, but the game is great! Been playing it since beta and will continue playing).
