How many times will you post on reddit to get people to send you BTC?. And why do you need to prove your identity to tell us this story?
Attention reddit: do not donate to anyone especially from Venezuela as there were 4 other stories about bitcoin and it's an obvious scam. Even if that person isnt asking for anything they are trying to make you feel bad for them so you can send them btc.

Your a liar. They would literally have to walk your Mom through getting the ip, enabling remote desktop in windows, and giving them the password she just created. Not only that but she would have to have her bank info saved in her browser WITH her password (or give them all the info). THEN she would watch them physically control her computer while she stood  idly by watching them move money from her bank account.  The women in your family are either the dumbest women in the history of the world OR your a lying sack of shit

This makes no fucking sense... you can buy ANY amount of bitcoin and save it yourself.  It is a scam because we all know the price is going to go up and you basically just made money off that person..or you stop paying.

If you have a bitcoin atm near you from what I read it only requires your cash and wallet address, but I think you have to scan a wallet.  Seems like being an atm found a loop hole somehow. Sends you a text verification of the deposit too.. maybe someone that used one can chime in.   Or people still sell bitcoin on eGay not sure of price though
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:27:33
People who sell are retarded and shouldn’t even be allowed to buy crypto.  “Oh it’s dropping better sell before I lose a lot”.  Only reason bitcoin is on this fuckin rollercoaster is because a bunch of assholes sell.  Then people buy back in on the dip, starts climbing then same assholes sell again.   Newsflash all the fees and bullshit these airheads are paying in exchanges and bank fees are hardly worth the effort at least let it climb before selling...or go back to wall street where you belong buying penny stock

I hate watching paint dry.. I think general population of ppl don’t know what cryptocurrency is, but they have heard of bitcoin and know what it is (even though that’s what a crypto is). I don’t think bitcoin is going anywhere and if the US tries to regulate it (and they will) they will fail miserably.  Just like how they try to regulate guns every time someone gets shot (forks make people fat btw). Bc the US government would lose its ass and tons of money if ppl started using more of bitcoin, mainly Bc they can’t tax you and fill their pockets.  Dimon needs to stop talking about bitcoin for his own good Bc honestly he’s attracting more people TOWARDS it.  Especially since now he says “blockchain technology is great and we are going to create a similar currency” after he talked shit about bitcoin.....when what he wants to create is basically bitcoin.  But, I’m sure he’ll tax the shit out of it, maybe come out with some jpmorgan crypto debit cards.. maybe a crypto loan? Oh how fucking awesome.
@_date: 2018-07-04 16:40:06
How does the state know that wallet Id is there’s? What if they said they fudged one number or letter? It wouldn’t work unless btc was recognized as a currency and a contract with their wallet was signed and notarized. Your putting yourself at risk unless it’s a true friend that works for you
@_date: 2018-07-04 15:28:03
Yeah it was...a bunch of syscoin outgoing all transactions were frozen until they figured shit out.  I’m sorry “irregular trading” resulting in syscoin selling for around 7000 btc. Shortly after a “system maintenance” was scheduled.

More like “sorry who the fuck carries cash and the minute you run with my cards I’ll freeze them on you”
Seriously though who actually has cash on them? You can pay for air in your tires with a credit card or debit card now.  Paychecks are direct deposit
@_date: 2018-07-04 15:46:35
I wouldn’t Bc bitcoin isn’t acceptable everywhere right now, I believe the law is payment has to be able to be readily available to secure utilities, food, housing and health. Not only that but an employee can turn around and claim you never paid them, then you’ll have a lawsuit

It would be cool if there was a cryptocurrency “middle man” which takes a small fee and instantly purchases shit for you. Fees that would be smaller than exchanges and less steps and complication as opposed to  using a crypto debit card.

I’m gonna make an account post something ridiculous then use my other account to agree with my ridiculousness 
@_date: 2018-07-22 15:32:04
The point is only to use one middleman though? Bc my idea would push all of the other middlemen out which would make it cheaper and easier for all crypto users.  Also I’m thinking it’ll stop a lot of security breaches in online purchases to date, not only that but may even increase the value of crypto as a whole. Just spit balling here, if you think that idea sucks then it’s whatever I’m not serious about it...

Your friend looks like Jarod from ‘Silicon Valley’..oh shit this isn’t the roast me thread
@_date: 2018-07-22 15:10:50
But you don’t have to use the middle man, middle man doesn’t need your ss middle man doesn’t care if you hodl or shop till you drop, middle man doesn’t charge you bullshit fees, middle man doesn’t report you to the IRS.  More of a service, for example no one needs to login, certify, or any of that jazz.   One could say a crypto exchange is a middle man controlling the money also, but hey.. I was thinking more of a service for example:; I go to website and have some btc, see something I want, go to “middleman” website paste url, pay in btc, wait for transaction to complete, then “middle man” pays for the item and sends item to your address,. Unless something like that already exists?
Almost like ‘hey I got a lot of btc and want to lower my cost of living’ type deal. Because nobody wants to pay taxes on crypto AND pay an exchange fee that’s ridiculous. Until I can pay my utility bill, cable bill, or groceries straight from my btc wallet it seems like a feasible solution

Another speculation is crypto trading bots ect.. how many ICOs joined the game with the business model of “crypto trading”  TONS, nearly all of them.   Take these coins out, trade for these coins, cash out, put profits in their coin.  Bet they all follow the same trading ques and tells too
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:13:31
If everyone sells their bullshit ico tokens and don’t buy them again if wouldn’t fluctuate so much. Literally millions if not billions are dumped into bitcoin and taken out, repeat, repeat repeat.   Who the fuck buys ico tokens if all it does is take all their millions and invest in another crypto. Dumbest shit I ever heard
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:15:58

There’s already middle men with crypto, 
how do you cash out? 
Oh an exchange.. 
when you cash out where does it go?                      Oh your fucking bank.  
When you cash out what’s the fees?
Oh yeah we forgot there’s a fee to send crypto to the exchange wallet then a small fee to exchange crypto to fiat then oh shit we will tax you also, and here let me drop this pile of money in this BANK ACCOUNT.
so why do you cash out though instead of hodl?
To pay for shit you need/want. 
My idea = problem solved with lower fees until crypto is widely accepted as a form of payment.
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:27:05

I mean just being a pussy ass bank is reason enough for me even if you aren’t involved in crypto just goes to show you how their scared bank works, also makes a statement of being a bunch of cowards. Remember when they declined credit card/debit transactions for anything involving firearms?  LOSER bank. I mean they must be doing well since they don’t need any interest transactional income from firearms or crypto.  Next thing you know it’ll be porn, sex items, and them telling you where you can stop for gas.   PATHETIC excuse for a bank.
