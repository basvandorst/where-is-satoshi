Sorry to bug you about this, but how do you create the API keys on Binance for each individual coin that you want to track on Bitsnipp? I can create an API key on Binance, but it looks like it's just a general API key, but it looks like Bitsnipp needs an API key for each coin? I've got to run right now, but I'll be looking into this more later. Didn't know if there was an easy solution for this issue though.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:36:14
Maybe I'm retarded but I was plugging in address tracking and shows that the Stellar address I'm tracking has $53,000 more than I actually do. WTF?
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:49:39
So what exactly is going on with the wrong balance being generated? Is that actually someone else's address that I randomly keyed in? I feel like this is a really dumb question but what is the difference between generating new API keys and the address for my wallet on Binance?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:22:38
This is perfect. I love it

How do I add API keys from Binance to Bitsnapp. Is there a tutorial anywhere that explains how to do this? I see the Binance option to edit API keys but I don't really understand it. It allows me to create an API key, but do I need to do this for every single coin or can I create one API key that will allow for me to track my entire Binance portfolio on Bitsnapp?  
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:53:48
Obviously I have a lack of understanding and I don't mean to pester you about this, but is this any sort of security threat? It seems to me that there is a lot of exposure in one way or another to see the information that the app is currently relaying to me
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:45:51
How do you figure people are scamming them? There's no credit card that just gives shit away for free without any benefit to the company/institution. Buying crypto with credit is probably a wet dream for these credit card companies. As these past 1-2 months have shown us, it most definitely is not guaranteed that you're going to make money buying crypto. I bet there are a shitload of people that got burnt horribly bad since they bought into these insanely volatile markets
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:32:32
So I'm really confused. I plugged my ETH address into this app and it's showing that I have .08 more ETH than I show in my Binance account. 
What's going on with this?
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:43:48
I guess it's the XLM deposit address on Binance
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:00:33
I think you're going to see a correction once we hit 17k. We're not running nearly as quick or hard up at these 16.75k-17k levels compared to the 15k-16.5k levels
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:26:44
God damn. I'm flustered but if we're still at 15k when we the exchange gets rolling again I'll be very tempted to buy some more. I don't really want to put more capital into this if GDAX/Coinbase are going to be a piece of shit though
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:48:13
Yeah their servers were getting hammered to the extreme. Their were so many transactions going through. The trading volume just before 20k was nuts. My major issue with the exchange going down is that it kicked 99.99% of the traders out but allowed that .01% to cash out and drop the market $4000 before anyone could start trading again
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:36:51
My thoughts as well. Now we're seeing it fly back and $1000/transaction
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:31:21
What is going on with this insane trade volume?? We just keep getting massive dumps here and there where it drops the price by as much as $1,500 in a matter of seconds, and I'm talking after GDAX went down too
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:08:52
Depends on how you purchase them. If you use a credit card then the BTC is available immediately. If you transfer funds from something like a checking account then it takes a stupid long time like a week. I would be very cautious when buying BTC with a credit card though. Don't go crazy and spend more than you can afford to pay for. I think BTC is still a lot of steam left in it in regards to upward price movement, but this thing is going to pop at any given moment. I'm sure it will recover, but the 3 questions are when is the bubble going to pop, how low will it crash, and what price will it recover to?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:09:17
Well when the exchange crashes but somehow allows $3k to get shaved off the price and I purchased a little jag at $18k when day trading to dump some off at ~$20k then yes, yes I am going to complain
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:19:14
Yeah I'm sure that you're right. Although I'm not positive what you're meaning when you say that GDAX is driving the market up. I'm assuming you're talking about the overall BTC market, otherwise I would have to disagree with you and say that the traders on GDAX are driving the market up on GDAX themselves because people are dumb enough to buy BTC $4000 more on GDAX versus buying it on another exchange even though you're getting the same exact product.
I know that there is some market manipulation that goes on since this is all so unregulated along with there not being THAT many complaints since everyone that actually holds on to their BTC have experienced such massive profits. This shit that crashes GDAX and Coinbase accounts is just totally unacceptable though. It is fucking insane that an exchange will crash for 99% of users but still allow a select few to continue trading and dumping their position. We climb to just under $20k and the exchange conveniently and suspiciously suddenly crashes and then the market is able to drop 20% even though that 99% has their account activity frozen
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:16:58
Yeah I'm irate. I had an offer in for 20k for about 2/3's of my BTC and was getting concerned that we were going to crash/drop price because it was getting so choppy/laggy so literally went to sell at the market and then it fucking crashed and here we are...
EDIT: I'm so frustrated my trade fucking crashed
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:37:50
That's probably something that I should pay more attention too, but I wasn't even looking at the other exchanges, but now reading about it, it sounds like the premium was way out of whack. I'm wondering if coinbase is just the most popular/user friendly exchange for all the new BTC business/customers
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:03:38
Someone is on a mobile device
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:34:55
Well... BTC is actively trading around 17k right now. It looks like GDAX is crashing again. 
This is probably a really stupid question, but what's the easiest/fastest way to buy from somewhere like Bitstamp and then transfer it over to GDAX to dump?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:24:53
What price is BTC trading at on GDAX right now?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:33:24
Got back in about 5 minutes ago. I was able to get back into my coinbase dashboard in and out the last 30ish minutes but it continued crashing
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:40:51
Your story sounds so interesting and unbelievable. Can you give somewhat of an overview to how it all started and how you got to where you are now? How drastically has your life changed and what was it like before striking rich in BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:34:58
Or It tanks right before I pull the trigger
EDIT: God damn I feel like I'm playing high stakes black jack in Vegas right now
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:12:23
What'd you get locked out for or what's the issue you're experiencing and how has Coinbase responded to the situation? I have heard lots of nightmare stories about Coinbase and how users will get their account/funds frozen but I've never experienced anything like that. I mean, something like that is just absolutely unacceptable when you have a product that is fluctuating as much as 30% in a day.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:14:00
I was talking about the GDAX exchange as well as Coinbase's server. Yes, they did crash. Also it's fine if the price naturally fluctuates hard and dips suddenly, but the issue is not about the price going down just because that's the direction the market was flowing. The issue is that as prices were screaming higher the exchange suddenly crashed and froze everyone's account activity except for a select few, who then cashed out at the top and drove the market down by $3000. I'm pissed GDAX went down and didn't freeze all accounts. They just froze *some* accounts
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:02:02
It is insane how wild trading volumes can suddenly come out of nowhere and the market just blows up
Edit: Maybe not out of nowhere. I guess GDAX was down for a bit...
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:25:16
This was in reference to the physical exchange/GDAX platform crashing which in turn shaved $3,000 in the next 5 minutes whil 99.99% of the users couldn't do anything with their account/BTC transactions
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:23:18
I actually trade grain for my job so when I'm on GDAX it looks like I'm doing what I do everyday. I don't know what adding bitcoin contracts to the CME is going to do or how it's going to pan out, but it'll be fucking nice to have a reliable exchange that won't just shit out on us. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:08:08
Yeah I have no idea. I imagine there are enough novice bitcoiners that have no idea how to do that. I've only ever bought/sold on GDAX so I've never even looked into doing something like that but it seems like something that should be a no brainer??
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:51:03
I'm so fucking pissed.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:18:03
Yeah, you nailed it. It's not like you're going to live off of 15k. Now if you have a $100k problem that's going to follow you around for a LONG time if you're in the boat that is in
Edit: Not saying that a $15k problem isn't crippling, just that it can be a lot worse
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:18:54
I have no issue with holding but let me day trade this shit. I want to buy dip and sell peaks. Not just get locked out when the market is doing some seriously crazy shit. No doubt in my mind we'd be over 20k right now if the exchange didn't crash. Also, how the hell are people selling their bitcoin on GDAX right now?? I've been locked out for a half hour now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:24:17
I'm right there with you. Literally was doing the same thing as you
