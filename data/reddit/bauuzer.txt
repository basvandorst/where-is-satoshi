Yeah that would definitely apply and be correct though buying coins isn’t the only way to acquire coins so it’s not always applicable. 
E.g Receiving coins for services and Donations if you don’t have a BTC card like Coinbase Card, you’d likely still trade on LocalBitcoins / other to attain FIAT which then isn’t trading for profit as outlined in the regulation.

Happy my tax authority has a blatant loophole as they have no clue what they’re doing ��
Taxable Reason: You must pay tax if you trade crypto’s *for a profit* 
Loophole: Most traders on peer-to-peer sites eg LocalBitcoins trade under the market rate *so if you use them, you trade at a small loss and are untaxable*

Smh it would be like 50 million users if Coinbase had a proper system for handling account closures and potential issues ��

Could this be linked to New York passing legislation allowing Trumps taxes to be released by law?

Hopefully this will help the Latin Americans greatly but I’m excited to see if this could help turn The Caribbean into a key region for cryptos (similar to how it is for Private Banking)

Yeah it dropped direct support, though I just use my BTC Debit when I need to buy on Steam ☺️ they don’t know the diff lol

I’ve still to purchase with Bitcoin at Dell, I use it a lot on Steam though ☺️

Not sure why it was written as if Venezuela controls part of Bitcoin or something �� or lessens the superiority Bitcoin has financially.

It seems like you could link your laptop to a TV via a HDMI cable (to function as an external display, won’t show the broken pixels from your laptop) then you’ll only have 1 hurdle left: Working out that password, since you never mentioned the HD being ruined.

I never stated it was right nor that it was a clearer view than others, I stated it’s an opinion of mine that’s formed since 2012, I never said I was better than others or my opinion was more because of my start date, everyone differs. 
1 - Hmm that’s your opinion, we all got different outlooks about Bcash, others see it as a good option and others not so much. Though LTC and NEO sure those I can see doing very well myself. 
2 - I never said 40k+ was the limit, its a simple figure since more tokens and coins are created near enough daily, So it’s easier than just knowing the exact figure, at a hourly rate or something. 
3 - Okay so probably the wrong choice of words for that point, but personally if it’s created to not be centralised, everything being pegged to it is essentially it being a centralised thing, just in a different aspect. That’s what I meant, though it’s not people’s fault more something that needs to change at some point.

The focus should be on the failure to update their sanctions to incorporate cryptocurrencies from external sources instead ... 
�� who actually cares that cryptocurrency was the method of payment, its used for so much nowadays, to me it’s just a clear lack of response to how fast cryptocurrencies are adapted by individuals and in this case, a nation.
* though this would depend entirely on if I believed in this or not ...

Sorry you guys see it that way, but that’s my opinion as a HODLer since 2012
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:55:37
Buy a company such as Luno (registered and regulated for crypto) which encompasses cards, an exchange and wallet services and make it the default option to use crypto on amazon, that way it’s a real boost.
Instead of buying a volatile currency which likely would just lose ya money ��
(Think of how amazon works to combine its purchased business into its existing “mainframe”)

�� Great news for the continent 
@_date: 2018-02-28 06:24:58
As a HOLDer and enthusiast since 2012 I agree.
- BCH is making more progress and holds a better future 
- There are 40,000+ tokens and cryptos in existence
- BTC has long changed since it was created, I mean it was developed to prevent central control, yet the crypto market is dependent on its price ... seems opposite to what it was intended to do to me.
Most HODLing I see now is mainly with large quantities of low tokens, just like we did back when Bitcoin was cheap as chips 
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:49:24
The excitement is always great, though the BTC market is bad atm so no matter what red signs you see in your portfolios, keep hodling because the chances of BTC rising back up, outweighs the potential to plummet ��
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:31:06
Not sure if I agree with them aiming to pay back people or think the government should come and seize the funds, since its likely the biggest public scam/laundering to exist in the BTC world so far :/ 
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:32:47
I made the mistake a taking BCH seriously when it peaked at over 3000$ per coin, and gave it another chance during the recent fork.
Never again ...

You tried via PayPal? 
Not directly, but get a PayPal debit card, load your Paypal with your bank, then buy on Coinbase? 
It’ll likely have a payment fee and take a bit longer but you would still be able to load your Coinbase using your Card ��
@_date: 2019-09-23 16:17:06
Ah I literally only used BitPay in Namecheap 1 to 2 weeks ago to buy a new domain, never had to use an ID just had to make a payment.

“You know your conception of PayPal funds? Digital money with no borders? It’s like that, just no PayPal and pure freedom”
