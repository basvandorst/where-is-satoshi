Or you could just have an accomplice that triggers a transaction from the same wallet at a different location. It's not that hard to do and if Bitcoin gets popular, scams like this will only become more user-friendly unless something is done to prevent this from happening. With counterfeit money, it is possible to verify its authenticity at the till. With a CC, Visa is liable for any fraudulent activity. With Bitcoin, unless you use a Bitcoin bank, you as the owner of the shop, are completely liable.

Just because it is open source doesn't mean that it is safe. People using the tool may just not care to look at the source.

Actually, Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency protocol and not just a payment method. If people think it should replace another currency, then it should be as good or better in most use cases and it clearly isn't.

As someone who needs to program in Fortran these days, that could have actually been useful!

Aside from their Mac Pros, when has Apple ever been about power users? They were pretty small until they started selling phones and tablets.

If anyone is reading this in the future, it does work now. You just have to renew one year at a time.

If you go for the SEPA route, I recommend bitcoin.de as the exchange. Used them a week ago and they seem to run a secure operation and the marketplace is active too, which is important. You do have to verify your bank account though, so I'm not sure how that fits with using Transfer Wise...

Yes, I do. Please enlighten me with your list of citations.

How does it work when you're paying the bill? Do you have to wait 20-30 minutes for the transaction to be confirmed or do they just assume you're being honest?

It really annoys me that everyone thinks it is anonymous and untraceable. It is anything but.

Eh? The title clearly states $1mil, not the equivalent of $1mil. This is about transferring USD.

In fairness, you can replace a few rich people with many poor people and still push up the value of bitcoin.

We used to have intersango in the UK before Barclays closed down their account. Now I just tend to use bitcoin.de with my german account but you could probably find someone that accepts international transfers on there.

But what you're saying makes little sense. Deflation only helps people who hoard/save money and it is useless to anyone that wants a working economy. Economies work on people spending, not on people saving. I don't see why you would want people to save their money rather than put it back into the system for the common good. How exactly is an economy more prosperous if someone continues to hoard bitcoins? It means that there is less money in the system so less distribution of wealth and more inequality. This is perfect for banks and wealthy individuals.

The fact that this post actually has up votes tells me that is made up of delusional and ignorant idiots. Seriously, what do they teach you in school?!

And at least PayPal guarantees that exchange rate. Its hard to predict how much it would cost to transfer that much in BTC tomorrow, let alone next week.
