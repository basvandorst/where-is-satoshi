In the future, earth will be so crowded, that no location is any better than any other, because the only thing that matters is that it is housing at all. Likewise, the standard of living will be of such relative low importance compared to simply having housing at all. No longer will owning an entire apartment be common. Only the rich will be able to afford that.
In the year of 2600, the price of one square foot of housing will be 1 BTC. Average income will be 1 BTC per decade. If you start working hard around the time you graduate kindergarten, which in the year 2600 happens at the age of 3, and you work really hard for the 20 years that follow, you will be able to buy a comfortable two square feet of housing in which you can raise kids for the two years that follow those, and then enjoy retirement for a year.
After your year of retirement you can be satisfied that you have lived a full life, and not object when it is time for your mandatory termination of life at the age of 26 as it is for everyone living in the year of 2600, a policy that was introduced 120 years prior to make room for the young. In the year of 2600 care for the elderly is not possible. There just isn’t enough room for them on the planet by then.

Very much obviously so. The accompanying music is clearly trying to set the mood for how viewers are meant to feel about this. This is far from neutral reporting. And for that I downvoted the OP. We need neutral reporting, and leave the decision about how to feel about it to the viewer.
