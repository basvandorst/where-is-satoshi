Great comment. Calling the person responding ignorant isn't helpful either.

Where did you come from?!?!?

Do you have information/links on the security vulnerability? I'd like to read into it

I'm under the impression that Bitcoin Cash doesn't have segwit which would keep it from being able to connect to LTC and other chains with it activated. Wouldn't this be a downside long term? Been in the space for awhile, just don't understand how BCash breaks free. Also, so many alts are tied to price of btc

Cool, thanks bud!

I can't fault you for trying to bet someone on a sure thing.

Let's just say I see bitcoin in the short term and sustainable farming in the long term. It's neat you are able to do both (which is kind of the point of your post right?).
I'm not saying anything is wrong with betting/gambling. However, I could definitely understand why people would be skeptical about a post that says "don't believe me? bet me!". I'm sure a con or two has used that one before.
Again, I'm not trying to discredit you. Just trying to explain why some folks may be bent out of shape.
Regardless of what happens, if you want to send me more info (whether posted or pm) on your operation, I would enjoy looking through it. Thanks.

I was going to post a similar message as but he did and you've replied. I can understand why people would be 'hostile' if bets and exchanging bitcoin is involved, people are skeptical of others on the internet, rightfully so, and the bitcoin crowd is typically more so than most. Despite the bullshit, if you are really doing it and it's working out for you, I would really appreciate a thread or post about your set up (mining and farming) after all the drama. I'm interested in sustainability and bitcoin and you seem to be living the dream. Thank you.

You should probably delete this, not just an edit.

It's a good book. It's referred to a lot too, I hear the '10,000 hours rule' on TV and radio all the time.

Professional Psych Grad here... I dance like this. It's about letting loose from everything else and enjoying the moment.

I understand your ;) but it's not something to look forward to

Good ol Minnesota nice... you're coins are going to split in value and the person with your btc will get the other half in the form of bcc... i dunno what will happen long term but i would be concerned short term

Can confirm. Spent my early teens/90's looking for SNES walkthroughs and hanging out in yahoo chat.
