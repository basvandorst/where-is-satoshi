3rd party Accounting Firms are paid millions of dollars to decipher and resolve dozens of Government agencies budget discrepancies. VA, IRS, Military, Department of Energy are just part of a long list of government agencies. The Military gets their budget, then each branch gets a piece of that, then each command gets their budget. All of them reporting expenses and costs in different ways.
Good luck deciphering all that.

It'll be: "Post 9/11 Security Services"

during a financial crisis, people tend to not have money to put into other (depressed) opportunities. The time to do that is when the economy is strong and people (investors) have more cash to reallocate.
Besides, the folks that sold out during (or on the way) to the bottom of the last financial meltdown, missed out on the biggest bull run in the history of US equities. in other words, better to just HODL and continue to DCA. Sound familiar?

one thing is for sure, there will be a financial crisis in the future. Now tell me why bitcoin will rise when that happens.
