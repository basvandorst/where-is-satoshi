An excellent comment. Thank you for this insight.

The way I see it if I want to transfer certain money to another member of the network then every link in the chain would have to have that exact amount reserved at until the transaction is over. That seriously complicates the process. However do correct me if I'm wrong.

The way I see it - LN per se will not bring much benefit to the Bitcoin transaction capacity, however the real benefit will be that it will allow payment processing companies to serve as intermediaries between various individual and business users - sort of like BTC PayPal, but simple, quick, anonymous and uncensored. Still, centralization is the thing to worry about.

@_date: 2018-09-10 16:24:25
A clear case of [cognitive disonance]( (Wikipedia link). Some time ago I got massively downvoted in a thread where I called a reality check on a guy having a ridiculously bullish bullshit statement that he feels sorry because it was last time ever we saw Bitcoin under 7k (it went under 7 twice, and once under 6 after that). Basically OP is trying to reassure himself about his investment going rancid. Here's a more realistic approach - there's no real reason for Bitcoin to hit &gt;10k in years (if ever). I sure hope it does, because I like money as much as the next guy, but we are presently in a massive downtrend and there's hardly any reason to believe change is just around the corner. Read about contrarian investing or let me summarize; when you stop seeing shit like this on this sub and everybody turns pessimistic will be the time to expect the tide change.
@_date: 2018-09-10 16:32:12
Why can't you believe in technology without thinking it must hit &gt;100k? You sound like a religious freak when you talk like that.

Basically my problem is that video lacks any substance... it's cute girl babble babble then she explains financial bubble... then she concludes with the statement that many people still believe in crypto... have we lowered our criteria this much? I kind of expected to hear more about the latest technological advances (and there are plenty) and use case, not yada yada I believe in Bitcoin... *all smiles and puppy eyes*
@_date: 2018-05-18 20:56:13
Are we looking at the same chart? I don't see any solid support at 8k, I see a support that is barely holding and will turn resistance in a few hours. For now 7k+ levels seem like the reversal zone, but what really bugs me is how strongly the market resisted 10k. Without a real climax selling I don't see the strength to go to new ATH. So 6k and below seems much more realistic before any new ATH, regardless of how unpopular that opinion might be around here.
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:48:18

Ok, I get it, it was you that were not clear enough obviously because peeps are downvoting you and upvoting the preceding comment which is basically on the same line. I thought you were doing some Bcash type of maneuver where you are trying to oppose the exchange argument by using some rather strange banking analogy. I think I understand now, I retracted my downvote. If I may further explain why I think your comment is confusing; the problem with the analogy is that records of ownership of money are not regarded in consideration with the place it is kept, while records of BTC ownership are only available in regarding of the address.
@_date: 2018-05-21 18:24:15
I am a Redditor for an Internet eternity, and involved in Bitcoin for years. I truly believe in this technology and its importance, yet if I am to discuss the possibility of price action being in a downtrend you will call me a nocoiner. Is that how it works?

To me what makes all the difference is if you got shitface drunk and spent your money or if your drink was drugged by someone who wanted to steal your stuff. One is the artefact of white privilege where you think you can go any place on the planet act like you act back home and expect locals to bend over to your white skin, and the other is bad luck and bad hombres working against you. This information makes all the difference between fuck-you-take-some-responsibility-for-the-first-time response or dude-how-may-I-help response.

This is higher timeframe trend reasserting itself, very common market occurrence. And as you can see very turbulent. Whenever you see a long green up candle like the one of mid-April the chances are very strong there you will eventually see a long red one going in the different direction. If you are going to buy the dip wait for the short term bottom to be confirmed, it is certainly not here.
@_date: 2018-05-29 09:36:48

Would you say 2017 growth was systemic price overblowing, or does it just work down?
@_date: 2018-05-18 22:01:29
6k seems closer to present price than 6 bucks, and relatively recently it went to 6k levels. If it goes way under I'll reevaluate my assessment and who knows it may eventually touch 6$. Bitcoin is still very experimental technology and it might fail, but let's hope it doesn't. Support and resistance are nothing more than heuristic tool for understanding the way that ratio of supply and demand moves. How real they are is a matter for discussion even among TA people. But many people make their living using those tools, regardless of what you or anybody else thinks about them.
@_date: 2018-05-16 10:46:26

Skin color is not important here, you're right about that. I might have used a wrong way to describe a rich country privilege where guys of any color come to lower standard countries and expect locals to accept their ways and act as their servants. However his story suggests privilege and doesn't provide some of the most important information. For instance where are his drinking buddies today, why can't they help him? Also guy could just be making the whole story up in order to get some sweet BTC from suckers.

What you're saying is beyond dumb and clueless. Let me get this straight: discussing downtrend as a possibility is a sign of weakness of some kind?

And it did fuck up the network to a certain point, causing hashrate variability that will only get worse with this fork. This shit erodes stability of the network, but you wouldn't notice it because hodl meme production remains stable. Also there is a crucial difference between the forks which I would expect most people to know by now - Bcash was a clean fork with built-in replay protection and the intention to make a new coin. S2X is a takeover attempt with no replay protection, no consensus and with the (nominal) support of the majority of miners. It is not the same thing and it will be ugly for a while and everybody who knows anything knows that.

Is it really very predictable? As of today S2X still has 84 percent of miners signalling for it, yet basically has no commited developers and it's futures are worth a fraction of legacy. A big segment of miners is also very motivated to just fuck the Bitcoin up to pump Bcash. So what do you predict will happen and at what time scale?

I don't think it will necessarily ever be primarily currency, it is a financial instrument of a whole new class that will have some overlapping aspects with traditional currencies. But personally I believe it will be much too volatile in the foreseeable future to functionally replace use of fiat money. That does not mean it is pointless, it is a seed material for a whole new economy that is here to stay.

This is not a correction but a downtrend. It will reverse at some point but it's hard to predict where. If the downtrend ends a year from now and the price reaches under 3k values it would still be a completely natural market development yet many of the all-in-just-hodl guys would be suicidal by then. So be careful about giving your advice, they might fuck other people's lives up. I hope this community gets more mature.

No, still a long way to go. Do not try to catch a falling knife. Do not try to buy the bottom, buy recovery and you'll be much more content. But believe me, before we hit bottom you'll open this sub and it will be like staring into the pure despair. As long as moronic optimism breaths around here we have not seen the bottom.

Once you see Bitcoin is failing to overcome resistance of the previous resistance/support area for days in row and the trading volume keeps diminishing, especially if the market is already in the bear mode. Sold mine at 9k area, bought back 1k cheaper. I don't feel like I've betrayed the idea of Bitcoin.

This is an excellent answer, I mean I am also sick of reading moronically optimistic price predictions by every dimwit who bought while the price was soaring but to say Bitcoin has no use is beyond uneducated. If I may add couple more problems it solved: 5. The issue of seizure of property (which is a great tool for every autocratic regime in history, often following the pattern of first seizure of property followed by a genocide of by then helpless group). 6. It opened a whole new financial market to the social groups that would never participate in financial markets otherwise. Also this market is (still) beyound the reach of traditional institutional players. 7. It provided a whole new global economy that allows people from developing countries to break free from the circle of poverty. 8. It provides way to move your funds in a relatively untraceable way (and constantly getting better at it). 9. It provides a currency for clandestine economy further undermining idiotic war on drugs. I could list more but I think this is enough to illustrate the idiocy of OPs statement.

I am passionate NO2x guy and I am just against NYA. I believe Bitcoin should and will increase block size if the need for such action occurs. At this point there is no such need and this is just a corporate takeover attempt. In the unlikely event of it succeeding I will leave Bitcoin for good. DCG + Bitmain will never be Bitcoin.

Would you believe if we told you there are no pros? It is supposed to decrease network congestion and fees, but it's untested, unsafe and underdeveloped so it is extremely irresponsible to rush the hard fork, and the reason they are rushing it is most likely because full SegWit adoption will render it's deployment obviously unnecessary. The other side made it very clear the only reason for 2x is to fire Bitcoin Core, and for those of us who believe that firing the most knowledgeable Bitcoin experts and replacing them with non-existent developers is a suicide attempt there can be no imaginable benefits. Sometimes there can be no "balanced view", or if you don't believe that is true please give me some pros and cons of racism.

I don't care about the definitions or even about Satoshi's white paper, let's not make Bible out of it. What interests me is a reality of its ever changing technological development and social impact. If it will morph into something completely unforeseen, great. I want to be around to see it. And as for buying groceries the solution of that issue is around the corner, with the full implementation of LN there will sooner than later be a reasonable payment processor that will allow you to pay for whatever you want with Bitcoin. For me that is not the real measure of adoption, I will consider it a complete success when it becomes such a standard payment protocol that you'll be able to use it even without knowing you do. How many of us know anything about Visa money transfer protocol?

@_date: 2017-10-25 13:14:02
Regardless of everything those Coinbase dingbats are hurting the 2x cause, by bringing more uncertainty to be associated with the hard fork. And that uncertainty will be translated into support deficiency, and any lost support is weakening the determination of miners to mine at their loss. At this point 2x looks like a sinking ship, let see if it can make it to the harbour.
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:13:02
When you have one washed-out developer you ain't got shit. Miners know it and businesses should know it as well. If 2x was anything else but an attack on Bitcoin the other side wouldn't fork their own shitcoin three months before supposed hard fork, and of course they wouldn't be silent about their much anticipated HF. All the creative, productive, and informed individuals from the Bitcoin community are against the shady NY agreement. Let's wait and see how that works out.

There is a trading approach where a buy signal is generated when over 70 percent of public expresses the negative sentiment towards an asset. Sell signal is correspondingly generated when overwhelming majority of public shows a high degree of optimism about the price and value of an asset. It is within the power of hard core hodlers to put Bitcoin back on the bull run path, just give the fuck up and accept the anxious despair you are feeling already.

No you're not. The constant underestimating of the importance of real developers (as opposed to Garzik) is bullshit that will not stand the test of time. 2x is a suicide pact by a significant but still minority segment of the industry. Miners excluded, if BCash thought us anything they will be back to mine the real Bitcoin in hours so they can afford the experiment. The others are gonna have a bad time.

TA isn't about price prediction - it is mostly about having a small window of opportunity when a balance of buying and selling pressure has shifted too much so a price is likely to move in one direction. To say such conditions do not exist is beyond clueless.

Why would you want to get rid of the bots? Algorithmic trading is stabilizing the market in so many ways, arbitrage being one of them. Imagine having 10 or more percent price difference between exchanges. It also adds massively to the trading volume.

Well indeed, not fully convinced yet, but sure looks quite uptrendish.
@_date: 2018-04-20 09:04:20
You're blaming the wrong thing for those giant swings. If anything it is a result of things called stop hunting and short/long squeezes - where strong market makers push the price over a support/resistance line in order to provide liquidity from stop loss orders and/or to liquidate underwater short/long orders. If anything should be banned it is leveraged trading because it massively increases squeeze success rate and it can fuck people's lives up by making them lose their money very fast. But then again, nobody's putting a gun to their head making them take leveraged positions. Edit: typo

My thoughts exactly, the sole idea it might be true made my sick and nervous. The level of clueless stupidity we're seeing these days is scary. There are actually guys here who believe BTC will defy laws of market and keep growing forever. Probably because its technical problems and relations between devs and miners are so successfully solved.

I believe this is wrong. He is massively afraid UASF would show a real disposition of power within the community and weaken his position. On the other hand if he goes for BIP91 he's not only avoiding UASF, weakening Bitcoin Core, but it also gives him a moral high ground to demand bigger blocks ("we went through with SegWit, now respect NYA"). He would be a fool not to do it.
