I thought the Bitcoin community was one that supported new ideas, new technology, and new usecases for blockchain. There are some altcoins that are aiming to do things other than being a currency. The same people who were extremely early adopters of Bitcoin should be supportive of some of these other blockchain usecases. It's discouraging to see such dislike of anything that isn't Bitcoin in the blockchain ecosystem.

"Should of" sounds like "should've"

If you buy BTC at $9,000 and wait 10 years to sell it at $50,000, that's making more money than buying and selling on the ride up. Why would a bot that does this make money?
I can see how an arbitrage bot might make money, but the price differences between exchanges change so rapidly and it takes so long to transfer funds from one exchange to another, that I think it'd be very hard for it to be profitable.
What type of bot are you thinking is going to make money?

How many times have you "used" your Bitcoin? I've bought some alts with mine, but haven't actually used it.
@_date: 2018-06-09 21:17:21
Most of the time they are behind it, but I can see how front plates could be useful. There are actually several states that do require 2 plates.
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:30:51
But a lot of ppl didn't buy before $1000.
@_date: 2018-06-09 20:51:51
No front plates required

And set a max amount you're willing to buy. I really want to buy more now, but already bought my max when it was a little more expensive.

You mean the people who do / did dollar-cost-averaging?
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:57:43
My stance is that I have cut my losses and called all of my crypto worth $0 in my mind. I rest at ease with that. I am not worried or frenzied about losing it because I was prepared to lose it all when I purchased Bitcoin.
However, I would prefer to make money than lose money if I could.
I see 3 tactics: HODL, dollar-cost-average, and your proposed method. I'm in the HODL mentality, but could be convinced otherwise. I will not invest more money without selling, though, because I've already purchased Bitcoin with the most money I was willing to spend / lose, so that rules out DCA.
We are both assuming Bitcoin's price will recover from whatever minimum it reaches.
Additionally, your stance seems to inherently assume two things. 1: The maximum price of Bitcoin in the forseeable future will be less than what I originally purchased at. 2: The minimum price Bitcoin will reach will be low enough and the price it recovers to after that will be high enough (assumedly less than the price I originally purchased at) for the money invested in that time period to equal or exceed the value of the money I will lose by selling today.
To see the feasability of your stance, I need to calculate the price I'd have to buy back in at and the price Bitcoin would have to recover to for this to be feasible. I will do so in my freetime later.
If it is feasible, I will consider doing so, but it is a higher risk tactic because Bitcoin's price isn't guaranteed to go down low enough or back up high enough for your tactic to work. 
Your tactic guarantees that I lose money in the short term because it involves selling at a loss. It does not guarantee anything else. My tactic does not guarantee anything.

I agree. Glad to see this one seems up to date. Most of the ones I've seen think DDR4 is a myth and haven't heard of Bitcoin.

Makes sense if you're selling it at a higher value than you purchased it for. I bought Bitcoin at a higher price than it is right now, so I will wait until it's above that price to sell. Even if it goes to $0, i will not sell.
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:55:08
I hadn't checked the price in a while. I thought it was stable at 6k. Wtf made it drop so hard recently?
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:19:40
They haven't technically lost anything until they sell. The price Bitcoin has to recover to for them to make money by selling is probably less than what it is for me. So I wouldn't call them a loser. I didn't buy all of my Bitcoin in a lump sum either, and I'm glad I didn't. But, I've put in all I'm willing to. I don't know about the people who buy Bitcoin each month no matter what. I guess they're hoping it will be a more usable currency in the long term, so they never plan on selling any.

Okay. I'll have to look into that. I havent looked deeply at the youtube algorithms since last May. Thanks for clarifying that.

I agree, but I doubt that will happen in our lifetime in America, but I am going to be prepared for it if it does. Also, other countries don't have FDIC, or if they have something similar, the inflation hit you talked about would affect their market more.
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:24:00
FDIC actually insures your money up to a certain value, so it's not true that a bankrupt bank will take all of your money to its grave.
