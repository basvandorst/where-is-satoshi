G20-FSB rejects calls for cryptomarket regulation
LONDON, March 18 (Reuters) - The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulation for the G20 countries, on Sunday rejected calls from several countries for regulation of cryptometers, such as Bitcoin.
However, the FSB stressed the need for greater international coordination in monitoring these rapidly evolving technologies, which still represent a tiny sector equivalent to less than 1% of global gross domestic product.
"The first assessment of the FSB is that at present these crypto-assets do not pose a risk to global financial stability," said Mark Carney, president of the FSB, in a letter to finance ministers and central bank governors, who will meet in Buenos Aires on Monday and Tuesday.
Mark Carney, who will step down next year when he resigns as Governor of the Bank of England, noted that his successor would be supervising a regulator more inclined to review existing rules than to put new ones in place.
In his letter, he also said that the FSB, which conducted a series of banking and financial reforms after the 2007-2009 crisis, will focus on the current rules rather than designing new ones.
"As the FSB's work to close the fault lines that caused the financial crisis approaches its end, it will focus more... on implementing and rigorously evaluating the effects of the reforms approved by the G20," says Mark Carney.
