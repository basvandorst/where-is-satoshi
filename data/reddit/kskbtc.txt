I have a feeling it is not connecting to the internet. I assume when you turn on the miner it will automatically try to connect to the internet and pool and will start mining. The led on the site (miningled) is not blinking. I am not really familiar with routers. So no i dont really know what you are asking, could you explain a bit?

Yes it is a corporate setup, we live here with 8 people. I think the modem is switched 3 times to supply everybody internet. U just tried to change it, but tv and internet disappeared in the whole house:p. The router says the ip is 192.168.178.1    antminers ip is 192.168.1.99 .

hehe but still not working, because everything was gone incl tv i put an reset on the router. Thanks for helping btw! 
*edit* cant i change something in the antminer, so lets say 192.168.1.99 (antminer) to 192.168.178.99 or something? or is that not how it works?

I am looking in my router now, it seems like the subnet is 178, is that possible? If possible, i should change that number to 192.168.1.1 (new antminer). So change 178 -&gt; to 1
