As someone that makes a living streaming and does youtube on the side, I would never, ever, ever accept payment in BTC over cash. There are absolutely 0 fees attached to getting a direct deposit from Youtube into my bank account, why on earth would I want to get paid in a constantly depreciating asset?

Really? *This* is the comment that makes you angry? He's probably closer to the mark than you'd care to admit, then.
The top comment here pretty much says "No sane person can be against BTC, the only people who are are either ignorant or butthurt." There are legitimate problems with BTC. Your refusal to acknowledge these problems (even if it's overall a positive thing!) makes you look like a petulant child.

MUH INFLATION, the USD CRASHING TOMORROW OH GAWDS NOOO
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:19:34
It's an entire fucking economy. You fanatics think you can break down a reason why a currency fails into one or two little things because you haven't even paid attention in your basic high school economics classes. Currencies (especially real, functional ones with official backing) are very complicated things and are influenced by dozens (hundreds?) of different variables. To over-simplify something and make it sound like "OH ROFL THIS CURRENCY FAILED OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF X" makes you sound like an uneducated idiot.
@_date: 2014-10-30 06:00:02


The minimum wage was just raised last in 2009. Many jobs will give you a raise of at least 3% annual to keep up with inflation.


Debt is debt. Inflation is good for debt. It doesn't matter if it's debt that's contributing towards future asset building or not.


If someone with $20,000 in student loan debt suddenly experiences a massive amount of inflation, that means that their student loan debt (assuming the interest rate on the loan debt doesn't increase, which it shouldn't) just decreased in real dollars.
I hope your student loan debt isn't in business or economics.

What about people who believe in the technology behind but think it will fail as a currency? No one trades in BTC yet (trading in BTC when you convert it immediately to USD =/= trading BTC as a legitimate currency) and almost all of its value right now is derived from people speculating on it as a volatile commodity.
The technology is here to say, sure, but it's got some serious hurdles (some arguably impossible) to get through before it can be taken seriously as a currency. As much as the internet anarcho-libertarians here would say otherwise, there are **very compelling reasons* for centrally backing a currency and for encouraging inflation. For anyone without **at least** a 4 year degree in economics to come here and pretend to understand all of the economic ramifications of having zero backing to a currency and having built-in deflationary measures to it is arrogant and absurd.
I'm not ignorant of BTC or its existence.
I have a fairly good grasp of BTC and how it works. I'm pretty interested in it.
I don't "hate myself for not buying in earlier", that would be like hating yourself for not playing a certain lottery number. No one could have accurately predicted what any risky commodity will be priced at in 5 years.
I don't hold any because I don't believe in it as a currency, but I have ~$2k on mtgox because trading it is fun and interesting to me. I like the technology, but I don't believe in its function as a currency.
So which group do I fit into again?
@_date: 2014-11-01 20:12:21
Anything to back that up, or are we all aboard the "LOLPRECIOUSMETALS" train here like late-night conservative talk shows tell you to be? If you'd have had all of your investment in Gold 5 years ago, you'd be missing 30-40% of your money right about now.
@_date: 2014-02-17 02:02:42
The problem is that the top comment is fucking retarded and completely unrelated to anything being said here. But it's so that's par for the course.
"Buying during the dips" is the dumbest fucking thing anyone can say in the universe in regards to investing because it's the most common sense thing in the universe. But identifying dips as they're happening is something that people with decades worth of experience trading aren't even able to consistently do in stock markets. When you say "buy during the dips", 1) how can you identify the low point, and 2) how do you even know the price will recover?
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:07:38
You have this completely backwards. Inflation is great for poor people (and debtors) and terrible for rich people (creditors), deflation is exactly the opposite.
If one person has 1 million USD and another person has 100 USD, what happens to both as the currency inflates? The person with the huge sum of money is losing a ton of value on their money while the poorer person is losing very little value (comparatively). With deflation, however, that rich person's money is becoming much much more valuable while the poor person doesn't have as much money to grow in value.

I thought the entire purpose of your BTC was *no regulation*!!!!
@_date: 2014-01-05 23:43:21


So it makes sense that they would act the opposite if the currency depreciates, no? They would sit on it and not spend it since it appreciates in value.


There is less incentive to invest in said assets if your currency is always inflating, though.


Um...what? "Debt" can occur with any system, the only reason debt hasn't occurred with BTC yet is because BTC isn't a currency, just a volatile commodity traded by speculators and accepted by few who instantly convert it to USD. There's no reason why someone couldn't take out a loan/mortgage in BTC, though. There's nothing stopping BTC from being used as a vehicle for debt.


You realize the first scenario is catastrophic for the entire economy, right..?
@_date: 2014-01-06 00:47:14


I stopped reading here, sorry. Good luck in your future BTC preaching.
EDIT: Wow, fuck me, I lied, and I read a bit more down about you bashing fractional reserve lending. I highly implore you to do a bit of reading, even if it's only on wikipedia (see here:  so you can get a better understanding of things. It's clear that you're 100% touting the Ron Paul lines in pretty much everything you're saying. Do you advocate for the abolishment of the federal reserve, too?? Also, fractional reserve lending is 100% possible, even with BTC, because banks could just as easily use multiple wallets/tumblers to conceal their reserves.


Yes, this is **catastrophic**.

Continue to believe that Bitcoin will magically fix the world's problems when the majority of the people you want to help don't even have access to a fucking computer.
@_date: 2014-02-04 00:17:10


Please, please, please go read a wikipedia article. This is not what fractional reserve lending is. Fractiaonl reserve lending means lending out more money than you have to cover customer's deposits, meaning your reserve is short vs how much you owe the total amount of money deposited.
Here's how fractional reserve banking would work with bitcoin:
I own the bank of Bitcoin. You deposit 10BTC. 9 other people deposit 10 BTC. Now I loan out 50BTC. Even though there is "100BTC deposited" into my bank, I only have 50BTC on hand, a fractional reserve.


Go read a wikipedia article.

Here's one - the Federal Reserve [only exists to serve as a central bank in the United States]( not to set fiscal policy that empowers or assists the impoverished. The Federal Reserve has nothing to do with the federal policies set by the government to assist the poor.
Here's a second one - massive inflation would [hurt those who hold a lot of currency the most and help those who hold a lot of debt the most]( If currency inflated by 100%, that means your mortgage essentially just got cut in half.
EDIT: some more
A third reason - The Fed has little to do with "the taxpayer" or with assisting crony capitalism. You get fucked by Congress and the lobbyists that lobby Congress there, not really by the Fed.
A fourth - The Fed doesn't really "print free wealth for 1% of the population" because, as we said earlier, inflation is bad for rich people, too. Again, you're getting fucked by Congress/politicians/lobbyists there, not necessarily by the fed.

This...if you want to critique fractional reserve lending, that's fine, even though you probably lack the necessary education in economics to even field a legitimate argument. But "fractional reserve lending" can be done using any currency or commodity, it's not intrinsically tied to fiat.

I think all of the people like us who got in because we believe in what the currency stands for will still be here once this little swing is over. And once it's back up to that $1,250+ range we'll still be sitting pretty, watching when the next wave of pseudo-day-traders come in to try to tell us "it's all speculation" or try to "time the bubble".
We've came back from way worse - remember all of the earlier "bubbles" we've been through? If you would have told someone when the "bubbles" were popping at $30 that we'd be past $1,250 before 2014, what do you think they would have said!?

@_date: 2013-12-07 05:43:54
I would invest, but I'm out of work at the moment and I haven't been able to convince my parents to lend me anything for it yet. I've tried showing them all of the graphs and what not; hopefully I can use the money I get this holiday season and put it towards some gear. I was able to pick up a few 7950's for $500 on e-bay a day ago, so once I have a rig that I can put those in I can start mining LTC. The second part of my student aid arrives in a couple weeks so I'll be able to use a bit from those loans to get a rig set up.

Well, here's a small reminder of our last "bubble": 
China backing out is irrelevant, there's still a ton of drive in the rest of the world and there's plenty of room for more adoption and backing for BTC. We literally have nowhere to go but up! Today all we saw were speculators leaving the market because they're trying too hard to "predict" what's going to happen and got scared due to the China stuff. But if you're in it for the long haul and you realize the value that BTC has in the long run you'll realize it will only continue to jump.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:00:15
Just look at the market now and view the past several days. The price has been crazy high, I'm sure a ton of people have been cashing out pretty well. Not to mention all of the people like me who are still sitting on their BTC waiting for the price to soar again.

I don't understand why you'd insinuate that. With widespread adoption on the rise and more and more people hearing about BTC, I can't see it going anywhere but up. Maybe people are cashing out now for holiday shopping, or maybe there were just a few people who got nervous and sold off big when they saw a crash coming. Regardless, all of us who believe in Bitcoin (as more than just a speculative tool: as a currency that ~~can~~ **WILL** change the future) are holding strong, and we'll only see our BTC's become more and more valuable as time goes on. :)

If you believe in the long term performance of the market (see: every reasonable investor in the world) than the best time to invest is **always** now. It's never a *gamble* because you're not interested in short term profits, period. You always view your investments over the long haul. There is no "should I invest now or later, hmm, this is quite the gamble!" it's more of a "You know, the market tends to increase at ~10%/annually, so the sooner I get my money in, the better."
