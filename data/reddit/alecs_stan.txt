Americans gave us the fucking INTERNET and meow BITCOIN. They have unlimited credit on my tab.

Arpanet, and all the companies that make the web what it is today. I'll give you Tim though. The Brits are allready on the tab for Turing. The Swiss I give nothing.

Yeah Dutch people. Sell everything! (rubs hands and laughs)

Paywall.  Paste plz
@_date: 2015-06-29 22:35:02
Yeah, dream on.  Has Bitcoin ever spiked,  like really spiked on news?  
@_date: 2014-02-19 01:43:10
Just think of this.  What would an authentic image to a brand representing an Internet Currency be?  What is the Internet for a layman in regards to imagery,  associated concepts, and tone of voice?  How non tech people could be approached to engage with complex software?  The more you think about it,  the more you understand the sheer unintended brilliance of it.  It might well write branding history books in the future, or open new chapters.  For me it is fascinating to see it unravel,  and I support it with all my heart as any man introduced to crypto will someday reach the Bitcoin blockchain somehow.

Here is something I don't understand about Bitcoin.  Why does everybody when talking about inflation refers to the limited amount of bitcoins when you can create an alternative currency at the touch of a button.  This is inflation too. There is nothing stoping a big entity like PayPal,  Google or others from creating an altcoin and that would be serious competion to Bitcoin.  They probably haven't already because they realize this technology creates more problems than it solves at this time.  Bitcoin is 50 years ahead of its time.  That's a very long term bet..

In the best case he might be the man who had the idea, but I don't think he CREATED Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-19 01:44:21
I'm curious if potential jailtime would surprise him. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:14:53
Well if I would be really good at laundering money I wouldn't appreciate a competitor that could sweep my whole client base from under me basically because it charges zero commission. Would I? 
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:40:14
If I would suspect anyone it would be this guy.  How come nobody talks about him.  Had he been approached so far.  Bitcoin is in real need of an icon figure right now. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:48:26
There's no way this dude didn't play at least a role . You don't have to fill that many gaps  to picture it.

Plot twist: Satoshi steps in, buys MtGox and covers all the stolen Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-05 15:45:00
The fuck it is.
@_date: 2015-01-06 08:24:44
Shit like this makes me think Bitcoin can never be safe.. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:28:36
Gains steadily diminishing.. 
@_date: 2016-03-13 23:35:42
This is good for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:46:42
I got out at 470 loosing 30% of investment. I still deal in transactions in Bitcoin from time to time but I get in and out. I will never hoard Bitcoins again. Hoarding coins has nothing to do with supporting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:10:41
He best keep that dick healthy!
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:10:45
Did Steve started smoking crack?
@_date: 2015-07-29 23:07:20
This is why I got out. After an initial wave of enthusiasm I got it too. There won't be any mass adoption (if any) earlier than 15-20 years. Having some money I could invest in different things stuck in Bitcoin for that long didn't  make sense to me.
I still see it as an incredible technology and will probably use it in the future to buy stuff where it makes sense, but my mom won't. 
In conclusion, all the hoping souls holding probably won't get rich in the end. At least a large percentage of them. In a 20 years stretch life finds a way to make you sell..
@_date: 2015-07-20 21:20:06
That must of tripped some triggers in the mass surveillance crawlers..
@_date: 2015-07-20 21:21:00
I feel it's going to shit. And it started so good..
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:05:04
Wiping the tear of laughter from the corner of my eye it hits me. "The governments" weren't able to stop something as innocent as torrents. Good luck trying to stop something where there are billion of dollars involved. The biggest herd of cats spread globaly with fences in between states trying to be herded by each one inside the their fence. And the fences are more like just some poles with one or two transversal wood planks.

Who in Africa gives a fuck you have it in Sweden? Do you have it with Bolivia? Can it handle Iot?

Blockchain is here to stay. There are things being built that can't be replicated in the traditional fiat economy. Nanopayments is just one of the obvious examples. Once you get your feet dirty and actually start looking at the miryad of ICOS you can find spectacular ideas and redefine your notions of what a value exchange can be. I was a sceptic for a long time until I REALLY understood it. Nothing can stop it. Even at absurdum if someone takes down the internet we can put it in orbit.

Bitch you can't use Satoshis. Nobody thinks about transaction fees anymore it seems.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:03:22
What, local bitcoins is not counted as that? Why do we need centralisation?
Do you have any doubt that Bitcoin will still exist in China even if they close all the exchanges? Sure, volume will be much lower, price of Botxoin would increase more gradually but we'd also gain more stability.

I think half the hashrate is optimist. COuld be a lot more. So 2 weeks becomes 4 weeks or 6 weeks of very very very shitty transaction times. All the while you have a chain that flies in a mirror. And I'm not in any way a supporter of 2X. Just playing devils advocate here. Risks are big.
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:56:35
What's exciting about Bitcoin at this moment compared to alts?
@_date: 2017-10-01 12:17:30
If I'd own any significant amount of Bitcoin I'd instantly sell every version of it after the fork and but the stronger version down the road.
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:12:44
To buy more on both chains when inevitably both chain crash due to the FUD.

Finney and Szabo are probably the core team that started it.
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:29:53
Stylometry points to Szabo. There also might be an international actor involved, Szabo doing the writing as a native speaker would offer a more professional discourse. All actors involved are highly likely members of the CypherPunk club.

Made a transaction on Coinomi a few hours ago. Took beyond 90 minutes. I think something is up with Coinomi

It's going to 10k in 2018, you can buy whenever you want. But yes. Buy in chunks over a couple of days, don't rush.
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:43:54
Bitcoin is p2p. Remind me how long they've been trying to stop p2p filesharing and where it got them.
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:06:49
Yeah. What happens if all the hashing power under Bitcoin OG vanishes from under it's ass leaving it with a sky high difficulty? Do you know difficulty adjustment is counted in number of blocks? How do you reach it if block generation claws to a halt?
@_date: 2011-05-16 16:45:09
What drugs are included in that number ?
@_date: 2018-07-28 10:20:24
It's kinda bad to be almost dependent of Butmain and the institutional money.
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:25:19
I think cloning Bitcoin by changing the genesis block is great way to create a game currency. For example gold in World of Warcraft..

I am actually reading Snowcrash righht now. Guess I''ll be reading Diamond age next.

Was just looking for the comment about it :)

On the short term they'll probably move to other currencies. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:32:04
I think it's because bots like these the entire market crashed. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:00:54
Wanna bet? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:24:49
I'm waiting. Buying under 10.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:51:05
I guess the message is loud and clear. This isn't a small boys game anymore. Thx for the advice. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:35:42
Contemplating it makes you wonder... will we live to see anything more important than the rise of crypto?
