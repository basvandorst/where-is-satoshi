One of the real problems with buying bitcoin is the markup that exchanges put on it. The spread is really bad at most fiat-btc exchanges, and most people have very little options to choose where to buy. We really need a service that scans all exchanges globally and offers the best rate to the buyer. Because this is the same kind of greed that made us want to stop dealing with banks and remittance services to begin with.
And localbitcoins is just as bad.

A smart contract or private service that scans for the best btc buy and sell rates at exchanges and/or traders in a p2p platform...i think its not that hard...this already exists for fiat forex markets.

Follow these instructions:
* Login to Multibit. 
* Under the Backup heading click download.
* Open multibit choose Tools -&gt; Import Private Keys. Now import the wallet.aes.json file.
* If it goes well, and you become a millionaire, would you consider kicking down a few bitcoins? hehe :)

Try this:
Unfortunately, I think you will need to remember your password to decrypt it.
Also, if you can manually decrypt the file, you can probably open it with a text editor like notepad and find the private keys, and then just use those to import the account.

bitsquare seems like a decentralized wallet, how does it make debits from a fiat bank account?
