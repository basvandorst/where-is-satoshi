I did define lost and gave two examples, one true and practical and one hypothetical. In both cases it would be 'reported' as lost that are the only way of knowing, so the question is more regarding trading and perceived value than mathematics. 
But my question remaining would be a hypothetical scenario like a massive 'reported' loss like if the SR coins were 'destroyed' by having the keys erased. Or some Goldfingeresque plot against large holders. Would the community / trading react?

Yea, I'm guess I am just rightly or wrongly putting BTC in a place of any finite resource, if a bunch of it was lost the remaining would be more rare, and wondering if there is some technical or theoretical economic reason BTC did or did not act in this manner.

Perhaps I am not in the market for the right things this site is offering, but nothing I have priced on that store is anywhere near normal prices and the selection is horrible. I like that we all want places to spend our bitcoin, but this is kind of a turn off and the accusations of astroturfing are probably not unfounded. Need more credible / legitimate businesses to spend bitcoin at, not people trying to market or pander to bitcoin spenders with subpar online stores just for the sake of "but we take bitcoin!". Good for you, but it's still a bad/overpriced/poorly stocked site. 
We should not be impressed just by the fact that somewhere takes bitcoin. We should still expect them to still be somewhat of a legitimate business or offer fair products and services.

Makes sense. So does/would the community react to a hypothetical large 'reported' loss, or factor in smaller scale day to day 'losses' in value.
