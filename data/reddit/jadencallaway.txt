Right, my question is, is gdax going to eat the fee for when I transfer TO gdax from my wallet like they did when I transferred FROM gdax to my wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:07:07
Okay, I wasn't entirely sure how that worked. This is the answer I was looking for. Thanks for clarifying
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:11:56
Not necessarily. Technology also gets better. The "1180TI" or what ever the next equivalent to the 1080ti will probably be priced about the same, but will in theory be able to mine crypto much better. I'm not saying BTC per-se. But my point is, technology gets better, and cheater
@_date: 2019-07-27 08:30:50

Yeah, that was an options joke. In the stock trading world you can buy/write what are called options, you need four types of them for the iron condor. When you graph it, it looks like a bird flapping its wings. Anyway, when you own an iron condor your hope is that the security stays in a narrow trading range and doesn't move. When your option expires if all your contracts are out of the money, they expire worthless and you keep all your profits. They're one of my favorite options strategies.

It could be, but I don't think it is. They were all placed about the same time, it's a rather specific number, the majority of walls are at 16000,16500,17000 etc. And it's a huge number. Bigger than any of the other orders

It's not his responsibility to ensure everyone gets their boat back on time it's the boat shops. If he wants to pay an extra $100 to have his boat expedited and the shop approves it, that's just business. If the boat shop pushed back everyone else's order a day, that's bad business on the shop, has nothing to do with our guy. If I were the shop owner I would see to it that I can both accommodate my exoediter and ensure my customers are not affected.

At 10 cents / KWH. Bitcoin can drop to $2,242 before it becomes unprofitable to mine on a 1080ti, and similar price for all other cards and ASIC miners. 
In *My Opinion* this is where your main resistance is going to be. This is where bitcoin *could* bottom out if it does. 
The point at which mining becomes unprofitable is a true resistance point.

If you're a smart investor, you'll have already set limits and bail accordingly. If you're a stupid investor, you'll listen to meme's of kids who bought at 19K on reddit and HODL.

And 100-fold riskier, and more speculative. You failed to mention that in your comparison.
It's great that it would have the same returns as Google and Apple, cool. If I wanted that level of return I'd shift my bitcoin to blue chip and forego the majority of the risk involved in crypto.

That's like saying holding a dormant firecracker and a lit firecracker is less risky than just holding a dormant firecracker.

@_date: 2018-06-20 00:43:19
Lucky for you I studied Logic post grad. You're correct, there's an appeal to authority fallacy. But it seems you don't quite understand it. There's a logical fallacy in stating that a claim is true *simply* because some authoritative figure or expert in the field has claimed it to be such. I'll even agree with you that economist predictions and analyst predictions are no more accurate than throwing a dart on a board. 
So, yeah saying something like Bitcoin will reach 1 million dollars because Mcaffee said so is a logical fallacy. Right you are. 
But saying that volatility is one of the factors of risk isn't an appeal to authority. Are you going to say that it's a logical fallacy and appealing to authority when and engineer tells you that building a skyscraper out of wood isn't a good idea?
There's more to Volatility being a factor of risk than just "this guy said it" or "this entity says it" there's years of economic research and math and data that went into the basic fundamentals of economics and investing. The Greeks have been used as an assessment for things for decades. Are they always correct? of course not. But are some of the greeks used as an assessment for risk? Yes.
By your logic, I can say that anyone anything says ever is just an appeal to authority, and that's just not true. 
So bottom line, saying "Volatility is a factor of risk" is not appealing to authority.

You can't predict things in detail, and you can't predict things simply. Nothing about bitcoins historical chart can be used to predict future events. 
Time and time again random number generators, monkeys, cats, and darts thrown at a board have out performed top investment analysts who sit there and do math all day. 
Anyone who thinks they can use math to predict future trends doesn't know a thing about investing.

Ideally, your cost should be the fixed number, not the amount of coin. So Pick a number, say $1000, and buy $1000 worth of that coin every $800 drop. You'll have a much better dollar cost average

Crypto Theft at an All Time High: 2018’s Crypto Hacks Are Reported to Have Stolen Almost $1 Billion

Reading Time: 2 minutes
In its quarterly Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering Report, CipherTrace reported that almost $1 billion has been stolen or crypto hacked so far this year.
CipherTrace, which was founded in 2015 by David Jevans, develops cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering, bitcoin forensics, and blockchain threat intelligence solutions.  CipherTrace and its quarterly reports have become an authoritative data source which the industry continues to rely on.
According to CipherTrace’s most recent report, approximately $927 million was stolen by hackers from cryptocurrency exchanges and other platforms during the first 9 months of 2018 alone. CipherTrace estimates that this number will reach over $1 billion by the end of the year. The thefts that occurred during 2018 are reported to be as much as 3.5 times higher than the thefts of 2017, which totaled approximately $266 million.
2018’s Major Hacks
With the year-to-date cryptocurrency thefts continuing to set records it is unsurprising that there were several major hacks during 2018, most notably of which was the theft of $530 million worth of tokens stolen in Japan from the exchange Coincheck. Italy also saw a massive breach of the crypto exchange BitGrail which saw $195 million worth of tokens stolen. Other exchanges around the world saw similar thefts including Zaif in Japan which was robbed of $60 million and Coinrail and Bithumb in South Korea which were robbed of over $40 million and $30 million respectively.
In addition to the headline-making major hacks, CipherTrace reported that there was “over $60 million in cryptocurrency that was stolen but not reported publicly”. Current data is also indicating, according to CipherTrace, that the number of cryptocurrency thefts is steadily growing.  Several smaller heists in the $20-$60 million range occurred during the year totaling $166 million.
Anti-Money Laundering Threat Protection
According to CipherTrace “criminals will need to quickly launder these stolen tokens before stronger cryptocurrency anti-money laundering controls are deployed globally over the next 18 months”. The most prominent means of direct criminal bitcoin payments, approximately 97%, are through unregulated exchanges. Furthermore, a reported 36 times more criminal bitcoin is received by cryptocurrency exchanges in countries where Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures are either weak or not enforced.  These top exchanges are reported to have had approximately 380,155 bitcoins, which equates to approximately $2.5 billion at today’s prices, laundered through them by identifiable criminal sources from January 2009 to September 2018.
Although new cryptocurrency crime threats, such as highly targeted mass cyber extortion, SIM swapping, and advanced cyberattacks on exchange personnel are seen to be emerging. Governments around the world are responding to the increased threat with stricter AML regulations and measures which are being introduced to reduce the risk of theft.
One such example is the Financial Services Agency (FSA), Japan’s so-called financial watchdog who conducted several investigations of cryptocurrency exchanges within Japan. In March 2018 the FSA issued a business improvement order to Tech Bureau, the operator of the exchange Zaif which lost $60 million this year, to improve security and anti-money laundering measures.
With the international community committed to the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism, it is unsurprising that several countries including Bermuda, Malta, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and the United States are improving regulatory measures to combat digital asset theft. According to CipherTrace “opportunities to launder cryptocurrencies will be greatly reduced throughout 2019 and 2020 if cryptocurrency AML regulations are successfully enacted and enforced globally”.

I think you're mistaken. There's only 1536 wallets on the network with more than 1,000 BTC. I would wager almost all belong to exchanges like Kracken, Bitfinix, etc, because almost all were created in late 2018.
The rest are lost, like [This one for example]( which hasn't been touched since two months after it was created in mid 2010, with 31,000 BTC in it.

Yeah, this isn't going to make a dent in the price of gold. What qualifies you to make the assumption that adding one tenth of a percent of the total market cap of gold into the gold market is going to do anything? 
Who upvotes this garbage
@_date: 2018-07-23 22:24:05
I don't see anything

5-15% cash back!? What the hell kind of business model is that?? That is not sustainable at all.

Isn't the public ledger anonymous though? How do they know who's addresses those are

The price drops $100 then recovers by $100 dozens of times a day. What is this garbage?

Bitcoin is subject to manipulation. Maybe not as easily as FIAT, but still manipulable. Is that a word? Manipulable? Manipulable. Ah, this is Reddit, someone will correct me if I'm wrong.

Oof. Found the guy who bought in at 19.5K

You know, it's funny. I'd pay 23 for a meal, but as soon as I see .0036 BTC I'm, like, oh fuck no. I'm not paying all that! That's ridiculous.

Only .1, not upset about it. Come on 7,000!!!

Serious question, my portfolio is 84% BTC, 8% ETH, 6% LTC, 1% XRP, and 1% other.
As BTC dominance continues to rise, as I see it doing. Will these other coins eventually falter? Is it possible that BTC can gain market share and these other major alt coins can increase in their capitalization rate?
@_date: 2018-04-25 07:09:32
I didn't realize it was that bad. Do you have any resons for saying it's one of the worst out there?
Why Trezor over ledger?

And 29K of them are probably "Fudsters" or "Shills" according to everyone else in this subreddit.

What hardware wallets are not USB?
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:44:05
So the deal with hardware wallets are the private key is on the usb device itself, correct?

I bought more at 8.5, I'll buy more if it hits 7

How are you even allowed to send bcash to a btc addy?
@_date: 2018-07-04 10:28:54
Got into Bitcoin since the beginning but only the community in the last several months. Makes sense to me.

They're a private company. They can do what ever they want.
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:42:53
Why are you going to use it going forward?
@_date: 2018-04-25 06:02:00
Some guy said something good about bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-27 05:52:18
I use PNC, I wonder why they select some people but not others
@_date: 2019-05-31 10:56:42
Can you explain what you mean by "still have enough entropy on either segment?
@_date: 2019-05-31 00:56:10
Ledger has the option for 12 words
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:30:59
It can't hurt at all to reset the seed
@_date: 2019-05-04 20:33:56
Is there a club for if you own 2+ bitcoin? or 10+?

Next week that 800 will be 600
@_date: 2019-05-27 21:02:59
It's definitely more than the fifth time
@_date: 2019-05-31 07:35:08
8200? I think it was posted right around when BTC hit 9K for the day
@_date: 2019-05-31 00:57:03
my concern is just ease of restoring the wallet to something like Electrum, or Exodus, or something. I want to make sure my 12 word seed can be used on any wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:24:20
What was he doing? Was he trying to do something ..?
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:27:47
Ah okay. That's not terrible. Just stupid
@_date: 2019-05-05 06:10:37
What's that?
@_date: 2019-05-31 08:12:54
Maybe you can't? I will have to play with my nano x tomorrow but yeah, def can restore 12 word seed to nano
@_date: 2019-05-31 07:33:38
Well, this post didn't age well
