I was down for about 3 years 
Then things got much better 
Invest in what you believe will give you a decent ROI 
Be patient 
Good luck

Learn Austrian economics
Keynesian economics has got economies where they’re now, which is not good 
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:14:03
Says the redditor for 3 months lol
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:14:14
And it’s still up 950% over a year 
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:32:40
We have been waiting for 3 yrs for a actual Block size increase 
Bitcoin is chocking but instead of giving it some breathing space, it is allowed to continue to choke 
Thank the experts devs &amp; BS 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:23:50
Well done !!
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:54:15
What is needed is a block size increase 
Until lightning is developed and actually works for the general user 
@_date: 2018-09-24 12:09:38
You coulda bought another ledger or Trezor them input the seed into it 
@_date: 2018-09-24 19:41:58
You enter the seed into the device to recover the wallet 
Key logger wouldn’t be able to steal other seed 
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:23:48
Nightmare, Can't you login online, then send to another wallet?
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:14:12
Hope you keep them safe for him, until he grows up.  
@_date: 2014-08-08 18:42:15
That's nice n simple :), but Coinbase doesn't work in my country :( (yet)
@_date: 2014-08-08 13:43:28
But some people have kids already?
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:06:58
Nice present!! 
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:17:56
Liking your style :) I think, I know which one will do better in long run ;)
@_date: 2014-08-08 13:50:25
I will also buy a mycelium entropy when they are available
@_date: 2014-08-08 18:35:09
These things happen, he'll learn :)
@_date: 2014-08-08 15:41:24
lol 
How would you advise to keep them safe then??!!
@_date: 2017-02-14 20:42:17
Nano S 
@_date: 2017-02-19 01:42:37
Most of the hash power supporting SegWit is coming for a private mining pool
Go figure 
@_date: 2017-02-19 08:44:36
Reminds me of Segwit 
@_date: 2017-02-14 13:31:27
True, but you pay for what you get 
Buy cheap buy twice 
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:51:53
lol 
I was supposed to finish the sentence with "&amp; 5 weeks ago my 3rd child was born!"
@_date: 2015-01-29 13:18:30
At the time I did nothing other than send it to that addr
I thought because it is HD wallet, I would still be in control of the addr.
Yesterday I exported the seed the done a restore but it's still the same with Zero balance 
I have emailed info yesterday with the wallet addr &amp; transaction hash  
but they have not replied yet :(
@_date: 2015-01-30 22:01:46
I have just tried rebuilding the wallet on android
It is still not there, it is like it has built me a fresh wallet :(
maybe when i jailbroke my phone a couple of weeks ago
i wanted Bioprotect app while mycelium had no pin login
0.4BTC lost forever 
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:45:43
Thank you!!!!
@_date: 2015-01-29 15:40:45
OK thanks :)
I will try to restore using Mycelium on Android 
@_date: 2015-01-31 10:20:04
Yep, hopefully they will update soon
@_date: 2017-02-13 22:57:05
Keepkey is better than the nano 
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:38:50
@_date: 2017-03-12 17:58:35
 Now you are reverting to spouting FUD &amp; Drama mentioning AXA
Just follow the longest POW 
Or be prepared to get screwed
 I don't really give a fuck about all the above and neither does the Honey Badgar 
@_date: 2017-03-12 18:10:46
Don't own a single Bitcoin! lol 
I'm a hodler 
I just obviously believe in a different vision of Bitcoin than you 
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:45:51
Well done Jihan Wu !
Now just start mining BU asap!!!
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:20:58
Quality!!! Respect to you both for doing that, Hope it works out for them!!
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:28:02
Not looking good for team Core....
@_date: 2017-03-12 18:37:23
As opposed to the payment layer coin you support 
Each to their own 
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:30:17
Wouldn't bother to waste the electricity 
@_date: 2017-03-12 16:03:33
You sound like you want Bitcoin to change from a Peer to Peer electronic cash, into some form of payment layer which is not what it was designed to be, at least keep the backbone/ basics of Satoshi's design or it's not Bitcoin anymore 
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:57:14
We will see....
i think this is a bullshit article 
@_date: 2017-03-12 13:05:36
I think this is a bit like comparing Apples &amp; Oranges 
Keeping the block reward at 50BTC would drastically change the economic model of Bitcoins white paper 
Raising the block size doesn't drastically change the economics, it just allows more transactions in a block 
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:21:52
No thanks 
Would rather stick with BU
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:18:54
This Sub is full of non technical noobs 
It's only good for stupid memes &amp; Gifs 
Now a days 
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:18:43
Node count doesn't mean shit
Look at Classic historical node count 
Hash power is what counts!!
@_date: 2017-03-12 11:20:28
51% is technically the threshold to activate a hardfork 
Classic activated at 75% that proposal has basically failed 
BU can activate at 51%+ (unlikely with such low  hashpower consensus, but technically possible)
iIf a block above 1mb is mined the hardfork has been activated by a miner  then blockchain will split into two Blockchains connected to the original Chain.
Going by the white paper Nakamoto consensus would then dictate which Chain is the real Bitcoin by POW hash power 
Longest Chain = Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:04:07
Fuck the Core Devs, many sell outs 
BU is coming to fuck them 
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:28:25
Go ahead Fork yourselves off the network 
@_date: 2017-03-13 08:13:16
Thanks to core team not raising 1mb blocksize limit 
Now I'm looking forward to coins on both chains !
@_date: 2017-03-12 14:11:07
Read the whitepaper 
@_date: 2017-03-12 12:44:14
Maybe destroy your definition of Bitcoin 
Just follow the longest Chain, Simple.
The rest is Drama or FUD 
@_date: 2017-03-13 08:09:21
That's like saying your only using the internet if your using MS IE and not Chrome
Bitcoin is a Protocol, your core client is not special in anyway, people getting wise &amp; know that now 
Countdown to say goodbye to Core has now began 
The popcorn is ready 
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:32:38
If you say so 
@_date: 2017-01-30 14:26:46
This is being over hyped...
 
Network split before with Core software? 
The bug in BU was fixed swiftly by BU  dev team
BU hash power will likely continue to grow
 
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:20:35
What was needed was a block size increase 
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:06:59
It's a downgrade 
@_date: 2017-08-28 06:11:16
So no one uses it ?
@_date: 2017-08-24 06:57:19
The Market seems fucking ecstatic....
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:10:24
You've been listening to the so called "experts" too much....
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:31:44
What I meant was a simple but affective bump from 1mb to 8mb
Which has been proven possible without any current major issues 
Not a basically 0.70mb increase 
@_date: 2017-01-30 14:26:47
This is being over hyped...

@_date: 2017-08-27 02:36:24
Increase the block size to increase space 
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:48:48
He is not a Core dev without a potential conflict of interest though 
He is the CTO of Blockstream 
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:26:36
It is a POW not POS system 
That is why miners get more say 
@_date: 2016-11-20 11:00:39
Some Information about them is on their website 
@_date: 2016-11-20 10:52:31
We will see if Core gets the 95% hashrate support from the miners needed to activate SW.  
I'm doubting they will...
@_date: 2016-11-20 11:54:05
Satoshi was the creator!
@_date: 2016-12-14 22:43:50
@_date: 2017-04-11 06:04:57
That is what has happened 
So to force segwit UASF will potentially split the chain 
@_date: 2017-04-10 12:43:30
I would prefer a coin that's dev is  not funded by the current financiers 
@_date: 2017-04-10 20:22:36
I would not trust the bankers or The current major BS investor 
Why would like possibly want Bitcoin to succeed in a world controlled by fiat currency 
@_date: 2017-04-16 05:50:09
2 weeks ;)
@_date: 2017-04-11 07:00:41
Who would have thought Slush would support an Sybil attack on Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-04-21 19:49:32
Core do not compromise 
Hong Kong agreement
@_date: 2017-04-11 06:12:11
What a prick, supporting something as dangerous as a contentious HF  
I used to respect Slush, now I think he's on the gravy train 
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:39:58
It's probably better that than taking the majority of funding money from the same people Bitcoin was designed to supersede 
Cough cough $75 million 
@_date: 2017-04-10 11:59:03
Good Luck with the your Altcoin /s
@_date: 2017-04-11 07:01:46
A Sybil attack 
@_date: 2017-04-19 18:44:52
I take it you've never heard of variance?
@_date: 2017-04-12 18:36:58
Is he speaking as Adam Back President of Blockstream or Adam Back the individual??
Cause either way it's BS !!
@_date: 2017-04-13 07:14:42
Promoting Alt coins is not meant to permitted on this Sub.....
Am I on r/Litecoin or r/UASFcoin ??
How many of you've been pumping Litecoin recently ?
@_date: 2017-04-11 12:36:36
Upvoted from supporting being friendly 
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:50:07
One thing that's not fake is their Hash Power!
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:24:02
Yeah I bet 
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:22:19
Says the redditor for 2 weeks.....
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:38:44
It's a bit like a contentious hard fork 
@_date: 2017-05-20 04:11:31
The words "Will be supporting" is being slightly manipulated (taken out of context) here
Slush will give users the option of both chains (should it split), the same type of "support" would be provided to users where Bitcoin to hard fork
@_date: 2017-05-21 16:49:00
Node count doesn't mean jack shit 
Multiple nodes can be run by single entities 
@_date: 2017-05-11 13:20:29
On point 
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:47:32
This 
@_date: 2017-05-17 12:28:45
There was no Blockstream back then 
There was no conflict of interest 
@_date: 2017-05-12 05:06:41
Fear monger 
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:50:40
Will be nice to see you fork yourself off the network 
Sooner the better :p
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:26:16
Redditor for 1 week wants people to follow them fork themselves of the network lol 
@_date: 2017-07-05 21:52:02
because it changes Bitcoin too much 
@_date: 2017-05-14 07:05:44
u/americanpegasus 
Are you pro big block or pro small blocks ?
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:54:51
Or they have already sold out
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:23:53
They are in control of Bitcoin Core "Client" development, the most widely used Bitcoin Client.
@_date: 2017-06-10 07:14:22
Fuck off, your probably holding shit Litecoin 
HashPower or GTFO
Go start your own shitcoin with SW or just use the shit litecoin your already holding 
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:59:57
lol 
@_date: 2017-06-10 03:59:57
Ok go fork yourself of the network then
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:46:18
Go through my history 
I've probably lost more than they've ever held
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:03:19
It's a well paid job in "fiat" not Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-06-04 21:36:06
You can lead s horse to water but you can't make it drink!!
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:13:18
I think if they believe in Bitcoin and truly want to make it successful 
They should be putting their money where  mouth is get paid in Bitcoin sell what they need each month to pay bills &amp; living costs 
Then be stacking &amp; hodling what's left over 
@_date: 2017-06-16 06:53:00
How much crypto do you need to sell?
How much are the tickets?
Post is a bit vague 
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:24:10
They are in control of Bitcoin Core "Client" development, the most widely used Bitcoin Client.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:32:47
Try 
Http:// 
Never tried any of above 
But good luck!
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:02:10
Who cares what I hold
I am the one in control of the development of a $40B market?? No it's them 
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:58:57
HashPower is the only metric I give a fuck about 
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:29:06
Well they won't have any issue with proving it then ! 
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:48:46
He seams to have forgotten the title of the white paper
