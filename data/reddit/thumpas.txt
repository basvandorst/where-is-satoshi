That’s not true, something being hard to obtain does not make it valuable, if I dig a large and deep hole in my yard it will have been difficult to do but that won’t make anyone pay me for it. Bitcoin has value because it is scarce and it is useful for exchange and store of value.

Why does this keep getting posted saying it’s owned by JPMorgan? It’s owned by a holding company owned by them. Thats like if someone mailed someone drugs and you imply that the USPS is smuggling drugs.
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:09:35
How do you think shipping companies work? They own boats and they let other people use their boats to ship cargo, kinda like how USPS will move your letters and packages for you. Implying that this is JPMorgan smuggling drugs is entirely ignorant of the context.

The weird thing is I was just on vacation and hadn’t checked the price or even thought about btc in like a week.

No one can time the market, if you think you can you’re wrong. Either buy in or don’t but if you wait for a crash you might be waiting forever because you’ll always be waiting for it to drop “just a little more”. 
If you’re not comfortable with 3k at once then DCA your way up to an amount you’re comfortable with. A little less risky that way.

If you call bitcoin a bank you have a fundamental misunderstanding of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-10 14:11:45
The frustrating thing about arguments like this is that I don’t have an eloquent or convincing response to it. Because at the end of the day I don’t know how to convince you that you should care about other people but I do know that you should.
I have no way to show how helping others will benefit you because it doesn’t always. But I know you should do it anyway.
Edit: that was meant as a general “You” not the person I’m responding to

I had one of the most vivid dreams of my life last night and it was that BTC crashed and was fluctuating between like $9 and $16, and my first thought was now I can buy in big.
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:16:07
There was a thread on here about BoA freezing accounts of people who bought/sold BTC through coinbase. Is this much of a concern still? I bank with a local credit union, do I have anything to worry about? Would using a debit card be better than linking a bank account?
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:36:39
ok thanks, I guess as long as I'm just hodling it's not going to be suspicious anyway

Shhh don’t question, just circle jerk
@_date: 2018-09-04 13:11:38
Hey so these are probably simple questions but I'm trying to learn more. I get that fundamentally a wallet is just a set of private and public keys, so it's not tied to any service/UI/whatever. So that means if I already have funds in a wallet that I made with some other service can I make a coinbase (or whatever service) account with that preexisting wallet?
I've heard of people having their fiat bank accounts frozen after linking it with coinbase/whatever and buying BTC, is this actually that common? Is there an easy workaround for that? I think there are a fes BTC ATMs near me but I assume they charge a fee.
Also, the keys are generated using the seed phrase right? So the seed phrase isn't just authentication, like a security question with a bank, but rather it's essentially the keys themselves right? Or is that wrong.
@_date: 2018-09-06 14:13:35
Random question but is there any estimate to how many coins are inaccessible? I'm sure everyones heard that story of the guy who bought lots of coins in 2010 or whatever and then lost the flashdrive with his private key. Also, if there is no manner to retrieve lost coins then the amount of inaccessible coins will only go up causing deflation right? is there a mechanism to combat this other than telling everyone to not lose their keys/seed phrases?
@_date: 2018-09-16 15:13:09


There’s actually plenty to see, why should someone else seeing it before you affect your enjoyment of it?
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:09:28
Thank you so much for the response! I'm trying to incorporate crypto as a small part of my portfolio. The only BTC I own I got as a gift essentially through [ben.co]( Would you say it's fine for now to just keep using that or is it worth the effort to set up a hardware wallet for storage and only use ben for buying and selling?
@_date: 2018-09-05 18:30:42


@_date: 2018-09-04 16:08:49
Ok so Electrum is a wallet but not an exchange right? So I can send/receive BTC and it will tell me my balance but I can't buy/sell from fiat through them. 
If that's the case I'll go a head and make an electrum wallet for storage while I look into hardware wallets, seems like the best option.
Appreciate all the help!
@_date: 2018-09-27 20:29:54
I mean not necessarily, one of the principles of crypto is no *central* banks to regulate the currency but why are private banks out of the question. I mean crypto doesn’t have to physically guarded like fiat, but in a post fiat world people will still need loans and would probably want to earn interest on their savings.
@_date: 2018-08-10 12:35:34
Well first of all it’s a reddit link so I’m not sure what you’re so concerned by, and second my post isn’t even about the $5 I’m just asking that my wallet isn’t tied to one specific platform. And third, it’s not a free lunch because I spent like an hour taking surveys and looking at advertisements so I was actually probably making less than minimum wage.
@_date: 2018-08-09 21:25:01
Ok so I redeemed some points in a survey app for a $5 bitcoin credit, in the app ben. So I get that it generated a wallet for me but that wallet is entirely separate from the app right, the apps essentially just a UI? Like I could take that same wallet to some other service like coin base or just give people the address? Sorry for my ignorance but I’m trying to learn more.

I just wanted to share this because I thought it was funny, was checking my spam folder and noticed an email talking about "bitcoin for college students" clicked to see what it was about and basically it's an app where you ask and answer homework questions and get rewarded with points that you can redeem for like gift cards or whatever.  And they referred to these points, without a hint of irony, as "a bitcoin for college students"
apparently anything that involves both the internet and paying for things is automatically bitcoin now. Good to see mass adoption is really taking hold.

Honest question, are you basing this off of anything rigorous or is it like a gut feeling? I feel like there's half a dozen conflicting predictions in every thread
@_date: 2019-06-04 15:39:47
Not sure if this is what they meant but generally this is the trend seen with reserve commodities, namely gold. Poor performance in securities markets drive people to more solid investments that aren’t tied to company performance. I couldn’t say if this the reason for this trend in BTC but that might be their implication?

@_date: 2019-05-11 23:20:25
I agree they're an idiot but I assume their logic is they don't want to wipe out their savings but they would if they needed to pay back the loan. But they're confident enough in bitcoin that they think they won't need the savings to pay it back. It's still stupid but that's probably their mentality.

I apologize if this is a stupid question but does quantum computing pose any kind of existential threat to bitcoin? I know quantum computing is a buzzword these days and most people don't actually know anything about it, myself included, and I know that no quantum computers currently exist with more than a few bits. But how would cryptocurrency deal with shors algorithm on a quantum computer in 20-30 years?
I mean I guess cryptocurrency wouldn't really be at any more risk than the rest of internet including traditional banking. But fiat does technically have physical bills to fall back on. I suppose if quantum computing does get that far then we're going to have to rethink how we protect information in general and cryptocurrency will change with it, but I'd love to hear other perspectives on it.
