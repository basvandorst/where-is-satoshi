Never said they were. But lets not pretend people dont treat bitcoin as an investment vehicle first and currency second.
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:57:15
Now if only we can get people to actually use their bitcoins and not HODL and wait for it to go 100x so they can unload it on someone else. :P

Im willing to spend my BTC for more fiat. I can already purchase anything I want in real life with my current currency. Why is there a 10 million dollar pizza meme? I bought bitcoin to be in the market like the majority of people. I dont know Im even explaining this. doesnt matter if every single shop accepts bitcoin, the transaction volume outside of BTC-FIAT is still very low.

nahh its kinda hard to explain until you have actually been in the philippines. but this is just one shop with one owner putting his sign board as "bitcoin" its common practice to naming shops based on popular products. youll find "ipad,samsung,apple, alienware" shops everywhere but all they do is sell food really or its a computer shop for people to play games on. by looking at how small this shop is,  i doubt it even accepts bitcoin.
tldr: while this looks really cool, its really not a big deal adoption wise. (treat it as a billboard advertisement)

maybe , only time will tell if hes actually right or wrong. cant really argue his point in the present with how things are going for crypto. maybe well revisit this conversation years down the line XD

I know what prepaid load is. im pinoy. given how crypto is being advertised as a replacement for banks, and you telling me how it is a cash base economy and people only use cash for the most part. wasnt that my whole point in the first place?? if you dont need a bank cause you only deal with cash, why would you need crypto? im confused. cash is fiat.
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:32:40
no crypto is overvalued or undervalued since nobody knows its value, its really hard to say. it doesnt have a business model like a stock where you can read its earning reports . i have no knowledge of EOS and steem so i cant give advice there. DYOR :)
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:36:38
how ironic because the "buffet way" is to not invest in crypto :) its all about picking gems with good valuations and potential revenues.   
you are correct tho in putting money thinking you already lost it because that how you should approach crypto since its basically gambling
@_date: 2018-06-09 14:45:33
nah its just a cafeteria that sells food and decided to put bitcoin for marketing. its a common practice. just a local shop

i really don't understand the misconception about " it's hard for them to get a Bank Account, so a big fortune for crypto " in third world countries. that is a myth.
the two main reasons why people don't have bank accounts has nothing to do with accessibility of banks.
1. most people are poor and have no need for banks (or crypto) , some are unemployed some are uneducated and would prefer to deal with cash. they absolutely dont need either. what use is a crypto wallet or bank if you have nothing to store?
2. Most of these unbanked have no phones or dont know how to use a computer. it would be way harder to teach them crypto than them opening a bank account. all you need is paperwork and valid ID/ address to open a bank account. The process of getting into crypto is more or less the same with verification via exchanges and more complex in terms of storage and trading. I highly doubt these people would learn.
Btw all those people with smartphones most likely have banks cause they can afford their billshow else would their employers pay them.

This is a case per case basis tho paypal chargeback problems is not exactly new, its been there for years but It has its advantages. It just depends on what side you are on (you charging back or someone charging against you) i have been on both side of the fence.   
In my opinion these is a higher chance of for Bitcoin fraud since once sent you are never getting it back. a middleman is not always a bad thing. especially when dealing with online goods.   
TLDR: if you sent crypto you wouldnt even have had a case. your money is gone lol. in this case at least paypal "reviewed your case" and you had a 50/50 chance.  
its all perspective. im not pro paypal but no payment system is perfect.
@_date: 2018-06-10 02:45:24
ive been scammed / chargedback on sellers who have 5/5 stars on amazon and ebay. people sending you things that dont work and you do need the chargeback / dispute. and most of the time you will win. If I am buying anything online you can be 100&amp; sure id rather use paypal over crypto because at least i have a higher chance of winning a case.
@_date: 2018-06-10 02:16:12
No offense but i don't think you understand poverty.you are free to give your opinion but your view on what is important isnt the same as people who are poor. truth is the unbanked don't care about any of this shit.
the people who will care already have bank accounts and thats the target of crypto, 


these people take living paycheck to paycheck to the next level. what they earn is gone by the end of the day. their only concern is the next meal / rent. no there is nothing to "save"


this is so wrong on so many levels lol. you are assuming the unbanked has smartphones or even internet for that matter. or even know how to read or use one. this is a first world thing and the people who do own these most likely are banked ( how did they pay for their bills?)
Obviously there are unbanked people that can be reached but its probably so small. but when people throw out numbers of how many "unbanked" there are to reach, there isnt much you can do about it and their problem is bigger than "better medium of exchange"
people always think people have no means to exchange value when there is already a system in place. unless the world somehow replaces cash with crypto these people wont change.

Network effects only creeps up when its a good effect. adoption isnt really something you have to force down peoples throat. Good tech will gradually be discovered and used because there is a massive benefit and ease of use to them. People naturally gravitate towards what makes their life easier.   
Hence the biggest hurdle in bitcoin. It doesnt make my life easier lol , its the opposite infact where it is such a nuisance to use everyday, until that changes there is no "network creeping" that is going to happen.   
Facebook is easy to recommend, its easy to use and  see the benefits. people see others using it and it was fun (at least back in the day) people find value in it. It wasnt a hard sell.   
Bitcoin is a very hard sell.
@_date: 2019-02-08 05:37:40


yes, not with bitcoin. because If i send it with bitcoin its going to be slower. the person I will be sending it to will have to convert it to fiat and they are going to wait 2 weeks anyway.   


Have you ever send money across the Atlantic ocean for 1 dollar cent and got a 100% confirmation in \~10 minutes?
  
so if i dont need to send money abroad i wont need bitcoin then, got it. also there are fees when converting / using that "bitcoin" in fiat.  


Sounds horrible. When I die , i want other people to be able to access my wealth. also bitcoin is not a "store of value" 


Irrelevant to anybody with half a brain  
you can withdraw money in any country. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 23:08:08


is that a joke? i cant store my wealth if it keeps going up and down when i sleep. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 00:07:18
The whole still have to buy into the idea of bitcoin dont they?  
lets say the top 10 richest people converted their assets to bitcoin which drives the prices to absurd amounts in one day. sure the price of bitcoin is high, but you now have to convince the world to keep it at that set price. each person has to buy into the idea and accept that each coin is worth millions and accept it for payment. otherwise the price will just plument again. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 05:31:29
massive swings in short timeframe if you really wanna be specific  
If i am in my 60s and is retired and want to put my whole savings account in a "store of value"
it needs to be dependable, easily accesible, easily used, accepted everywhere, secured, safe from inflation . you know the actual definition of "store of wealth"   
people keep using this word but they dont actually know what it really means.  
@_date: 2019-02-18 01:03:45
Except for the fact that its not better. If it was better we dont really need to convince people to use them, they just would. i can list plenty of reasons why i dont use crypto for payment. im sure a lot of people here still use their credit cards.
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:45:55
quotes past performace as indication for future perfomance for his argument
I give past performance as facts, says it doesnt prove anything.

Horrible comparison. Whats the point of crypto if its illegal to the public. Obviously there would be a select few who will trade in their basement. It would no longer be a "store of value" or an investment vehicle. Crypto is risky enough while its legal. 
1) Rich institutions,investment firms. - say goodbye to these, there is no way they would risk their assets.the rich wants to stay rich
2) The public - last time i checked most people are law abidding citizens and still wouldnt do drugs.
If it has no value you might as well be trading play money , you need investors."Underground currency"  isnt exactly appealing. The drug business is also profitable , doesnt mean people are jumping at the chance to use/sell it.
 
Just having the word "ILLEGAL"  would scare 9 out 10 people. Its not about being "tough" its about not worth the risk for the reward.

like i said "ignorance" . yes no country can "stop" bitcoin and chances are it is here to stay . But countries can definitely make it hard as fcuk to buy/sell/purchase bitcoin. the vast majority of people are law abiding citizens and humans prefer convenience. So again saying it doesnt care about 4 countries is like like kissing adoption goodbye. you want it in the spotlight and used. not an underground play money. If you actually live in a country that makes it hard to buy/sell crypto you would understand better.
@_date: 2018-07-06 23:20:57
Im sorry that you dont understand. its alright child, you dont understand and that is not your fault. i told you i get it. the fact that you had to delete your comment just proves my point. we good fam.
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:22:07
someones feelings got hurt. I obviously exagerated on "everyone" and since it matters so much to you that i shouldnt generalize, there are a handful of people here who do invest in other holdings. a minority in the majority. doesnt change the fact that most people here don't manage risk.
i could care less about what you are doing. i just thought it was common sense and a half joke. lighten up cupcake.
@_date: 2018-07-06 21:42:21
you are preaching to the wrong crowd man lol. everyone here is a moonboy. nobody knows things like risk management and diversification. everyone here is put your lifesavings into bitcoin, take out a mortgage cause its 100&amp; going to replace fiat someday. you know the kind of thinking that  makes people bankrupt haha
@_date: 2018-07-04 17:13:10
You think bans will Encourage people to use it? 
yes there will always be someone who uses it.  the minority few. most wont be bothered. we barely have anyone using bitcoin. this certainly doesnt help that problem now does it?

"i know something you dont attitude" and basically give zero substance when it comes to a healthy discussion. what a waste of space as a person. like wtf is your point? you are so fcking amazing at memes? congrats. next time you have something better to say let me know

@_date: 2018-07-06 22:56:17
nyahaha holy shit its like arguing with a Kindergarten. makes sense now.  
this is you:
a) not "everybody!" there are people like "me" take it back!  
b) ha! i wasn't even referring to you!  (although he was replying to your comment and there are only two of us here talking)   
c) let me point out the obvious and  call it "handing his ass to him"  
im so sorry cupcake. you are right, im wrong. i concede.   
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:02:13
Whats there to understand? the meme is not even deep. its not rocket science rofl. its a shill meme, sure the india banning is old news and overused and has no effect on the market as much. my point stands. meme is not even funny rofl
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:39:16
how exactly did you "hand my ass to me" oh please do tell . you are just like a grammar nazi on the internet, trying to "correct" random comments.
with a little common sense you would know that there are 881,000 subscribers here and I obviously dont know "everyone" and therefore me using "everyone" is wrong by logic. its not rocket science and you pointing out that it doesnt apply to everyone and citing your "hodlings" like im suppose to be impressed just makes you a little insecure and i find it funny that you had to give personal examples just to prove a point.
yea your feelings got hurt cupcake since you could have just ignored my comment. it was also meant as a joke. me saying everyone includes me too. its not a dick dont take it too hard.

middle man is not really a bad thing lol. it provides convenience / safety. Some people have no interest in dealing with local selling and face to face. I cant trust anybody in person especially if you have thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin to sell. thats just asking for trouble
@_date: 2018-04-12 02:57:33
Also i like how you speak in future tense.
There is no "freedom" in bitcoin in this present time. Its adoption is low and stagnant and its uses is limited. I cant use it daily due to price fluctuations / places that dont accept them and just the inconvenience of using it. why wouldnt i just use my bank? take out my plastic credit card and achieve the same thing with less hassle. 
you are overblowing the problem of this "freedom" because it sells bitcoin. you arent as constricted in your finances as you might think lol. millions of people still know nothing about crypto and it wont increase/decrease their quaility of life. but yea keep dreaming that everyone wants this "freedom" when in fact people could care less and all they want is more fiat. lets be real
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:58:20
thats great and all, but the thread is about canada. and we only have a few banks here. the trend seems to be they are absolutely not gonna budge and deal with crytpo in general. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:55:06
store of value = No ( there is no guarantee that if i store my full savings on it that i will recieve the same amount when i want to withdraw) especially if it loses 70% value in months
asset- freeze- proof- = again to my point an asset is only as good as its uses. if i cant use it anywhere where does it get its value? I cant spend or withdraw. its basically worth zero to me. sure the government cant ban bitcoin outright but they can ban people from accepting them and this is a major concern. 
scarce asset = this is only due to demand , like i said if the use cases and adoption of bitcoin doesnt rise there wont be any scarcity. 
my mortgage is in my bank and if they threaten to close my account (which they are ) It will be a problem. 
your response seems to be a copy paste from wiki and bitcoin isnt rocket science bro.
I also dont see the point of you explaining bitcoin Pros to me since thats not the problem here. the problem is "accessibility to bitcoins". 
I mean, do you even read and understand bro?
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:05:12
So the answer is less adoption with how little bitcoins adoption already is? its only high because of the difficulty in buying/selling. to be honest its easier said than done. and I woildnt want to touch it if it means i have to go through the hoops and legalities. Its not worth it
 its getting especially hard for canadians to withdraw into fiat lately and its only getting worst.
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:23:19
1)mortgages / loans
2) credit cards
3) brokerage for my stocks
4) safe keeping of my fiat
5) purchasing anything daily
6)vault for safekeeping physical assets.
7) insurance
I mean you can say shit about banks , at the end of the day i use it daily. Bitcoin hasnt done shit in my life except increase my fiat. if bitcoin was to disappear today it wouldnt increase/decrease my quality of life but if banks did i would suffer. 
So No banks aren't going anywhere soon.
@_date: 2018-04-12 06:09:37
yea like i said it could be survivor bias. While i do know there are horror stories in regards to banks , same can be said of bitcoin. there is always that small percentage of risk involved. but at the end of the day Fiat is still king. for the simple reason of safekeeping value. I cant justify putting my mortgage in bitcoin and its valuation is weird given that it is exactly the same coin in terms of its function regardless of price. a 20k btc will serve the same purpose as a 1k btc in terms of exchange of value. until bitcoin becomes stable enough to be even usable there is no freedom in knowing you can lose 70% value in months. it still has a long way to go
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:57:13
Nah they are banning all forms of buying/selling in canada. 
wire transfer / debit / credit. if your account has been flagged and its involved in crypto etc. 
they have been blocking some wire transfers too
its been an ongoing thing in
  
banks released official statements that they are closed to dealing with anything in regards to crypto. Im canadian and ive talked to my bank and saw the emails. this has been an ongoing thing for a while now . its a case to case basis
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:51:10
Ban = less adoption and hassle to buy/sell. 
its not a gift, this isnt "good news". Its hard to buy and sell and what crypto needs is acceptance. if I cant withdraw it to my bank or use it to purchase things i want. What purpose does it serve lol.
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:47:11
Amazons adoption blew up. I order at least 10 items a month and its part of my daily life. its valuation is clear from a profitable standpoint, it could be overvalued but that is another argument.
I dont particularly use bitcoin other than buy coins or sell it for more fiat. Non of the places I want to use it for accepts it and the fees made it unusable. 
Price is not equal to adoption. Till i see bitcoin actually being used for what it is, its a bust.
@_date: 2018-04-12 02:44:10
my rbc account has been banned and im having trouble withdrawing in canada because quadrigacx is also having problems with banking. i have also been robbed point blank in person cause i once lived in a third world country. So I am speaking from experience. You speak with survivor bias and think that everyone has problems with the banks. 
"I have 100 thousand dollars worth of bitcoin meet me in person" - posting this in craigslist or other scammy sites isnt really my preference . 
Id rather deal with the banks because although they charge high fees the majority of people dont have issues and I know my asset is safe in fiat. 
hypocrites talking like they buy bitcoin because of "financial sovereignty" and btc will replace fiat. you buy it to increase your fiat.99% of people here only care about the price anyway. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:53:03
Is it just me or post like these would hold more weight If we knew what percentage of their network is being invested.  
Example   
a) I would be buying bitcoin every single day for the next 3years! ( 1$ buy per day)  
b) I will be investing 20% of network in the next three years.   
This is why I take peoples "im buying, just bought" posts with a grain of salt. Not to bash OP but more of a general observation that those 50 dollar buys dont really inspire confidence in me.
