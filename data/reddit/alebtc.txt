Check their GitHub. It had no value. All the buyers are idiots.

he's just a jealous old idiot.
@_date: 2018-01-27 05:03:34
traditional options? you either believe in the bitcoin's future or not. It's the future currency. And that's the very beginning.
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:46:47
What about the US debt? I strongly believe that Bitcoin is a safe heaven.

Well why the hell they didn't restore the old database and system?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:01:54
fuck off, bitcoin is the right currency, I sold my USD to get into bitcoin and never regret. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:06:06
you have bitcoins and the supply is limited. you can sell for USD with unlimited supply and get wrecked in the long term 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:05:09
I'm looking for a job now LOL
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:00:21
That's a big problem. But don't blame bitcoin. Bitcoin is a tech and no tethers can change the fact. Don't sell your bitcoins for fraudulent USDT and sleep well.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:03:46


check the price in 2-3 years.

lucky man, my congratulations. now when it goes back to $20k you double your investment.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:36:34
the post is not about altcoins. USDT is the fake USD.

I suppose bitcoin futures shorters can sleep well tonight
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:26:18
LOL, they are not redeemable.
@_date: 2018-01-27 11:37:14
Good time to buy. Better then it had lots of attention.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:49:55
People should buy at the price,  I'm happy it didn't go to $25K so it's still a good time to buy more
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:55:04
it's likely that  and  are in the same team shaking up the market.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:59:06
you should sell. otherwise you lose everything

Can you list 2/3 gen crypto? 95% doesn't work or centralized.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:37:29

To not to make people keep money. You should spend your money and buy things to make factories and people work.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:52:25
Economies are growing, the population is growing we need more money supply to use as a medium of exchange. You can't build the economy on bitcoins. It just makes rich people reacher because they are holding. Also the market is unregulated and dangerous. Watch out. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:21:57

I don't think it has any value since everyone trusts VISA. Banks have never stolen money from my accounts.

It's not your money unless you sell it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:39:50
I see.. In your absurd world nobody works, just holds bitcoins. Nobody eats, nobody shits and use heaters.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:29:37
Lot's of downvoters here. Means bitfinex has got lot's of bots on r/bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:31:28
I think big players already shorted 7300
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:55:58
just keep in mind 10x drops in the past.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:27:41
the volume is fake. I believe 80% of the volume is fake so to attract more customers (more liquid exchange) to pump and dump prices. They use USDT to pump bitcoin and if the trade isn't successful they don't care, because USDT comes out of the blue.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:14:08
Tether made. Can't believe how stupid people are here.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:43:24

@_date: 2018-03-04 23:09:26
looks like another fake FOMO post. wait a few months and buy at 3K. The market is down.
@_date: 2018-03-04 21:26:11


Bitfinex has no bank. It uses USDT though they call it USD. they are just lying.
@_date: 2018-03-05 13:59:30
there's smoke without fire. It see lot's of fraud going on right now. Since BTC futures are already active, the US gov won't hesitate to shut the bitch down.
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:47:13
Large majority??  The majority has 2 outputs. It's a fact. You can call it FUD if you want. The network usage is dropped significantly. Exchanges have always batched transactions.
@_date: 2018-03-04 08:56:08
Do your research. If someone present you facts, it would be too late to quit.
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:55:35
The network usage is low. The wash traders are hyperactive. Don't be too overexcited.
@_date: 2018-03-04 19:10:46
just normal day for wash traders.
@_date: 2018-03-03 10:03:58
The only problem is the exchange is a fraud. A few people use it.
 The volume is fake. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:00:44
A report created by an auditor who quit a few months later. An auditor who removed all references from their website.
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:41:29
The scam is way bigger than you think. They wash trade on all major exchanges. Buying their own orders moving the price.
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:13:30
looks like a scam
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:46:43
I really hope that is the lower bound.
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:11:14
idiots who can't understand the simple technology spreading fake information.
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:18:02
Bitcoin is not a fraud, but it's heavily manipulated.
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:15:05
the network is under a spam attack. Sit back and wait.
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:46:45
I don't recommend to trade using day-of-week-based patterns.
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:13:03
Slowly selling. You never know how high it goes. Their plan is to create fomo and sell bitcoin at the top. Never sell for USDT. Use local bitcoins, gdax or bitstamp. And withdraw to bank accounts
@_date: 2018-03-05 03:51:39
Normal people do not batch transactions. They always have many inputs and 2 outputs. I'm tired to repeat the fact.
Exchanges have been merged outputs for a long time.
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:36:12
clear price manipulation. it always goes down when bitfinex turns off bots. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:19:16
the network is under a spam attack. Someone create huge transactions with many inputs / signatures. Only a few hundred transactions get into blocks.
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:17:19
bitfinex scammers make people dumb.
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:37:18
Big players? who? It's a risky exchange since all USD pairs are in fact USDT pairs. USDT can go to 0 any time.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:18:03
I suppose many people didn't pay their credits back. So buy BTC using a debit card.
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:13:17
you can't buy on credit, but you can use normal bank accounts.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:15:58
slowly selling. The rule is never sell everything. you never know when the scammers reverse the trend. And they WILL.
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:38:38


Volume is nothing in unregulated markets. I can easily buy my own orders. Yes, I would pay fees. But bitfinex buys its own orders with no fees (wash trades).
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:48:20
what happened with Tether's subpoena?
Bitfinex is based in Taiwan. It's not easy to get them right now. BTC-e was caught in Bulgaria (A state in the EU). I believe Bitfinex and Tehter.to will be challenged very soon. 
Don't try to keep tethers. You won't anything out of it, but it can go to 0 overnight if it's unbacked nature is confirmed.
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:47:01
Only holding makes no sense, you should use it. Pay for stuff.
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:39:07
No audit. Their previous auditors quit.
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:45:49
All the huge transactions are coming from exchanges.
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:21:25
it's for clients.
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:28:02
Check their volume. I was talking about the biggest exchanges. Gemini is nothing.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:39:39
no more high fees now. because there are a few real users.
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:30:07
Check the mempool size. The adoption hasn't changed significantly since 2016. A few people really need bitcoin aside exchanges.
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:14:23
so what's the goal of your narrative? NORMAL PEOPLE DON'T BATCH TRANSACTIONS. They will always have many inputs and 2 outputs. Even though the fees dropped to cents, it's not used for buying coffee.
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:45:26
Are you talking about the report a year ago? Also nobody has ever withdrawn USD from bitfinex. Are you really that naive? 
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:15:09
The problem won't disappear.
@_date: 2018-02-19 09:45:53
the wash trading on the exchanges is amazing.
dropped to 6000. The demand is as low as a year ago.
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:01:22
You see man, even the forum is heavily manipulated. my comment was downgraded by a few folks. It's a huge scam system going on.
@_date: 2018-02-19 22:29:08
they heavily wash trade. they buy their own orders to move the price. so people lose money. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:32:44
I would care. It's 30% of the trading volume. And nobody knows if they wanna screw up miners as well.
@_date: 2018-02-19 10:42:44
Only exchanges batch transactions, normal people don't. It's very cheap now, but the mempool is very shallow
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:06:52
Tether pump
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:03:01
Yes, tethers are all around. In fact, USD volume is very low in comparison to USDT volume.
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:24:05
BTC wash trading is amazing.
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:45:00
It's a good UK paper millions of people read daily.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:57:17
I'm a true believer in the tech. I hate scammers. Many people will lose money and maybe commit sucide. I've already got back the initial investment.
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:54:38
It's silly people. Morgan stanley mentioned that only 10B was invested into crypto all around the world. Try to pull out  your gains now. Only tethers have created 2B out of the thin air and buy BTC with leverage. 
Enjoy your paper profit. LOL
@_date: 2018-03-04 19:33:36
why fud? there's no fud. only bitfinex created USDT out of the thin air which is used to pump bitcoin and wash trade. Now, USDT is 3/4 of the market. Imagine what whappens when Tether (USDT) is seized as it happened to btc-e.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:41:30
Nobody cares about altcoins.
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:29:54


many of them are that ignorant that they can't use wallets and hold. Just buy hype and sell low. So they will likely dump.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:44:02
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:42:29
USD and s&amp;p is a bauble. Bitcoin is fine
@_date: 2018-02-19 10:35:46
My rough estimation said 90% of the current volume is fake
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:25:06
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:07:51
Gdax is very small in comparison to others. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:32:01
Love February. it makes you search for a job.
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:31:39
I wonder if there's a chart of how many UTXO / hour we have.
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:44:24
Normal people don't batch transactions.
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:05:47
Tether will collapse the whole market. Lots of naive people think that USDT=usd
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:26:52


don't be so naive. CBOE, CME and FBI will get rid of the scammers pretty quickly. The next problem we gonna see is the huge price drop when 90% of the volume is gone.  
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:34:59
we should. but the whole hype looks fake.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:57:05
It's a correction. It's a normal pull back.
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:00:48
It's when I fomo buy my own order. It's like moving money from one pocket to another.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:47:31


yes I did.
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:21:15
it's for clients.
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:13:18
BTC will succeed, just another fools day.
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:17:13
To keep the price high wash traders need to keep the fundamentals high. I expect the rich is bitfinex and co.
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:34:44
The price is manipulated by bitfinex through tethers and wash trading. I believe the real volume is 10 times less than it in the numbers. Fraudulent exchanges are literally buying their own orders to move the price up and down.
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:01:22
No, I don't see it.
Payment &amp; billing -&gt; Payment Options 
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:59:37
He said to withdraw BTC from the exchanges quickly because nobody knows if they have enough BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:58:30
was a nice dip but not the bottom yet.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:41:59
Prove 
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:55:35
They print fake USD , buy your bitcoin with tethers , then sell it for real dollars and repeat again and again.
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:31:38
Fake USD created out of the thin air.
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:53:43
If they can't audit it then it's shady and fishy.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:03:53
Remind Me! 1 month "bitfinex collapse can FBI seizure"
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:38:00
No idea. Well the higher they pump it, the lower it will fall in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:30:29
Though it's still in docs
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:47:25
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:58:54
No, bittrex will be adding USD soon. I believe tether will disappear naturally. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:37:29
It's pumped with fake dollars:
@_date: 2018-03-04 08:53:39
Ver? I'm talking about bitcoin. The usage  is very low. It's 2 orders of magnitude below we saw 2 month ago.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:38:28
they stopped working with bitfinex because bitfinex might be involved into money laundering. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:50:15
shit post. fake news.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:51:09
Thank you
@_date: 2018-02-24 00:55:58
you're probably new in the space. THAY HAVE ALWAYS BATCHED TRANSACTIONS.
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:23:41
They have never been audited.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:45:05
An example of a pump and dump fraudster.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:09:44
Check btc charts at dates when the fake usd was created.
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:53:55
in demand?? People are jumping on the train. The adoption hasn't changed much. It's a pure speculation.
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:07:43
Well, yesterday 25M fake dollars was minted. It's enough to buy 13K bitcoins with leverage on bitfinex to create FOMO
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:16:41
Yes it is. Lots of people don't believe the truth and think bitcoin is in demand.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:38:33
you probably don't know how the economy works. Try to build the economy on deflationary currency and it's gonna stale.
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:19:18
1) if bitcoin drops all coins drop
2) if the bitcoin price drops and it becomes unprofitable then some miners leave so the system finds balance
3) some miners can still mine if then know that the price will recover
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:50:19
Trolling? What are you talking about? Bitfinex wash trading money out of the system and replace it with tethers.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:44:33
Who THEY? Bitcoin is decentralized. It's difficult to change it, but when it changes it gets the best tech available. You've been following Bitcoin for over 3 years, but haven't understood anything.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:57:47
what country?
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:06:02
Tether is USDT coin. A centralized crypto which is used to margin trade bitcoin on bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:23:00
I think a scammer sense scammers.
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:59:38
It's already crashed. bittrex will be adding USD soon. I believe tether will disappear naturally. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:10:07
the majority of Chinese traders are just gamblers. They will never buy and hold crtypo because they don't understand the tech, that's a pure gambling. They will dump as soon as the game is over.
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:44:21
 As same as USD
@_date: 2018-02-19 10:58:59
Absolutely. The current block size is fine. The problem is that bitcoin cannot resist the spam attacks. The mining power is centralised in China. And the Chinese Minors can spam the network on there own. So they get the fees back.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:28:40
Well, read their Terms of Service
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:13:01
SELL it will go much lower!
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:08:07
In fact, that's what happened.
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:21:04
Can last days or months as it happened in Dec.
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:03:11
That's a great idea. Both projects will benefit!
@_date: 2017-05-19 23:07:19
How long does it usually take?
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:56:18
Considering a hard fork in 2 months, you'd better not to buy at this price.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:41:50
First of all, can you explain why you bought it?
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:22:34


I think it's him. I checked bitcointalk. He announced Novacoin. A shitcoin traded only on btc-e.
