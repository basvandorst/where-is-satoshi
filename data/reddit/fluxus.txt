I don't think it'll have any impact, but it's the most popular sitcom on television and has ~15 million people watching every week, a lot of whom are definitely the type that have never even heard of bitcoin before. It'll increase awareness at the very least.

Whatever price you buy at is locked in, no matter how many days it takes for your bank to process the transaction.

Unless you had a time machine or psychic powers, there's pretty much a 0% chance you would have held those coins until now at $10.4k. You likely would have bought at $7 or $13 and then sold at $30 or $50 or $100 or $500 or $1000 and taken your profit and been happy with it. I could have bought 50 coins back in the day for about 400 bucks and opted not to, and I don't kick myself over it -- it's pointless.

Bitcoin, like anything else, is worth exactly what other people are willing to pay for it.

Use GDAX. It's the same company as coinbase.

I do the same. It's fine, and it works. There may be better options with respect to fees or what have you, but it doesn't bother me enough.
