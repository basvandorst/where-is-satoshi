Due to the block halvings I think it will need to get way way more efficient.

It was assumed that transaction amount on main chain would increase over time so that fees would stay low but still allow to pay off a huge mining industry. Currently every tx would need a price of roughly 10 dollar to weigh out not paying block rewards. A year ago it would have been about 50 dollar per transaction 
Edit: you can easily calculate it by multiplying block reward with current price. Then you divide this product by 30,000 (5 txs * 600 seconds). If the txs changes you need to update the calculation and also if the block time changes.

In my eyes it is to expensive

Sorry, yes I meant block reward halvings. Your example of 100 people sharing one transaction is not that easily realizeable or better said not sustainable. First of such a transaction must be coordinated by a service provider who for sure will charge some additional money. Also you make it look like instead 5 regular transactions per second you could send 5 batched transactions including hundreds of transactions each, which is not possible. Even using Segwit+Schnorr+"or maybe some other compression method" there can not be more than about 30 txs on the mainnet. So if we get back to $20K/BTC levels each transaction using batching technologies would still cost $8,... At a $100K/BTC level we are again facing about $50 even for a batched transaction.
Edit: and if we are facing $100K/Btc with half of the block reward we are at $100 for a batched transaction. Another block reward halving and ...

Yes, but initially the intention was not to hardcap the txs at 5 - 7 or increase the value of each transaction continously
