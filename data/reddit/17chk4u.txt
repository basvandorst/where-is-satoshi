Really pretty simple.... rather than using a sequential version number in the transaction header (i.e. incrementing to version=2), stick a **block height in the version number** of a transaction, and modify the signature to be XOR'd with the Hash of the block at that height\*.  Since the two forks will have different hashes after the split, you can control which side you want the transaction to operate on.
\* to ensure compatibility with current transactions, this is normalized by also XORing with the hash of block  so that Version=1 transactions net out to be exactly the same as now.
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:33:16
With "PARIS", wallets can specify that a transaction is only viable on a particular blockchain that has a certain hash value at a given block height.
So, if there's a hard fork, you could publish transactions that only work on one side of the fork.

Please don't be offended by his quick and accurate reply (although it was a bit curt).   The question gets asked so often on here that it gets a bit annoying.
You'll find this subreddit in general to be extremely helpful to newbies who do their homework and meet the crowd half way.
That said, I'll try to answer your question in a little more of a friendly and specific manner.
How to buy bitcoins depends on what you are looking for and where you are.  You mentioned $2500 USD.  Are you in the US?  That makes a huge difference.  
There are tradeoffs between fast, cheap, and easy.   Pick one or two.  "Cheap" means low-commission, not "half off".  If you see offers for half-off, they are most likely a scam.
And the volume matters too.  $2500 is pretty easy to invest.  It's not that much.
If you are in the US, there are several ways to accomplish your goal.  My recommendation would be to look into  and   With Bitinstant, you can buy about $500 worth at shot, and pay cash at Walmart or CVS and be done.  Quick and easy.   Might cost you 5-6% in commission
Coinbase, you would link it to your bank account, and buy 10 at a time.  It takes longer to authenticate, and so you MAY be able to get them in a week.  But there's a higher risk for coinbase than bitinstant (since cash is less prone to fraud than bank accounts), so there's a chance your first transaction gets cancelled.   So that can be a pain.  But the 1% commission (plus mt. gox commission of maybe 0.5%) means it's a pretty cheap way to go.
If you are not in the US, poke around on the links on this page, or state where you are in the world.

Bitcoin is soooo early in the "early adopters" phase, there are DECADES ahead of us and only four years behind us.
Put it in perspective:  There are only 200,000 Bitcoin Addresses that have at least 1 Bitcoin in them.  Assuming that the average "serious user" has multiple addresses, that's probably no more than 100K users who have more than $118 stored in Bitcoins. ($118 being the price of one Bitcoin as I type this.)
I think someday relatively soon (10 years) there will be a billion people with $100 stored in Bitcoins.  So that's a 10,000x increase in acceptance. 
That's why you aren't 'late to the party'.

If "regulation" means clarification of the rules, and what is legal, I'm all for it.  (As long as most bitcoin related stuff is legal.)
I want to know what protections consumers have, if someone steals their bitcoins.  (e.g. Is it "finders keepers", if someone guesses your pass phrase?)  
I also want to know what responsibilities Exchanges have (are coinbase and bitpay operating legally, or do they need more licensing?)  If we can get the regulations on the table (and they aren't too onerous), people can comply, and uncertainty can be removed, and banks can quit shutting down accounts!

Good discussion, thanks.
Re: Dust:     
Merging all unspents into one Address, or giving the user the capability to do that seems reasonable.  It might also make sense to add in some automatic dust-cleanup into the clients.  It's my understanding that transactions are always 1K increments (or something fixed), and if that's true, it might make sense if there's room in the transaction, to include a dusty input just to clean-up with each transaction.
I wonder if any clients do that.   (or if my information is correct about transactions potentially having room for dust-cleaners)
I agree with you on taint.
I agree with you regarding potential for Double Spends.  I was just contemplating the concept this morning about the ideal architecture for supporting light clients (and for that matter, making Bitcoin-QT fully functional without requiring an 8GB download.  Smarter people than me have been working on it!)
I think if Bitcoin-QT fired up and became "ready" as soon as it had the Merkle tree, that would be ideal.  Of course, it's not *perfect* until I receive the whole blockchain and feel confident that I have the "real" blockchain, having verified it from multiple sources.  
However, it could fire up, and get a Merkle Tree of the block chain, and have confidence by receiving it from multiple sources.  Then, presumably, it could query anyone with the WHOLE block chain to see if any of my Wallet Addresses have money (and gather all blocks necessary to prove it). At first start-up, this should take zero time, as all addresses in a fresh wallet should be empty.  So at this point, Bitcoin-QT could be "ready for transactions"... none of this 8 GB download business.
The next step (background) would be for Bitcoin-QT to start *working backwards* requesting blocks.  The most recent blocks are most critical to proving ownership of Bitcoins (since you need to check to see if they were spent).
Meanwhile, if someone sends me money in a new transaction, it can appear in my wallet immediately, but Bitcoin-QT would then work to build up the history of that transaction, all the way back to the initial Coinbase transaction(s) that created it.
Once *I* have all the blocks necessary to prove that I own the bitcoins that I think I own, no one else in the entire network *needs* to have that exact ledger history.  If I want to spend them, I have the blocks necessary to spend them.  (Not that I am advocating deleting the ledger from the network, but from a *minimally sufficient* perspective, the person who owns the bitcoins could also own the responsibility to prove that they own the bitcoins, by at LEAST storing those blocks, if not more.)
It's just a different, bass-ackwards way of thinking minimalist.  If that makes any sense.

This is sort of a circular argument, but basically the idea is that is if Bitcoin has ANY value, its properties make it unique and valuable.
There IS value in the capacity to be able to transfer value directly to almost anyone, almost instantaneously and almost free.  So if a bitcoin is worth some number greater than zero, than it is a mechanism to do exactly that, and therefore has value due to this capability.
Whether the exchange rate of a bitcoin is a penny or a million dollars, this capability helps it retain its intrinsic value.  It's a reinforcing feedback loop.
But if you can't spend them or exchange them, then then the capability goes away, and then the value goes away.  
(In a lot of ways, this is the same as any other fiat currency.  If you can't spend them or exchange them, then there's no value.)

Past performance is not an accurate predictor... BUT...
Generally speaking, [the amount of world wealth that is being stored in Bitcoin is rising 18.7% per month]( meaning that if this continues, you should get in as soon as possible for long term gains.
On the other hand, the same chart shows that we are currently pulled away from that baseline, and if you assume that the price will return to that baseline before the baseline rises up to the price, then there's a chance that the short-term price could drop to $50 between now and late September.  (You can see the lengths of the previous cycles in that chart.)

I think the 15 minute limit makes sense (or at least some time limit).  Essentially, Bitpay is guaranteeing an exchange rate, without knowing whether you are going to buy the goods or not.
With Bitcoin fluctuating as much as 55% in four hours (fell from 240 to 110 in 4 hours, April 10th), if bitpay set the limit to four hours, you could commit to buying a TV for $240, and decided 4 hours later if you wanted it for $110 (sticking them with the balance), or walk away.
Until Bitcoin Exchange Rate is much more stable, tight limits on exchange periods is just smart business.
Then again, if you think you can do better, go for it.  Competition will keep them in line.

Not a lawyer, and refuse to use the I'mANAL acronym, but my belief is that if you are OK, if you keep it under $1000 per person per day.
[Here's a specific 2003 FinCEN Q&amp;A document]( that refers to the other documents that mention the $1000/person/day laws (although the Q&amp;A doc talks about check cashing).


dollar amount of checks cashed per person per day to under 1,000 would not fit the definition of “check casher” under BSA regulations.

Well, I've hooked up more than a dozen people to Bitcoin, all via a paper wallet.    I have a packet that I give them, that tells them basically that they can hold onto this private key, and some day it may be worth a lot, or it may be worth nothing.  It tells them exactly what they need to do to import the private key (with "dated" information, explaining that it's likely to change as time goes by).
The quantities that I set people up with range from 250 bitcoins, to 50, to 20, to 1, and lately down to 0.28 bitcoins (obviously bought at various prices).  Not one person has asked for MORE information about how to cash out (since they have an instruction sheet), but each one seems grateful, and continues to be inquisitive.  Some have even bought more Bitcoins and sent them to their paper wallet.
Needless to say, the guy with 250 Bitcoins is thrilled now, and a huge advocate of Bitcoin as an investment.  He was a Gold Buff.

We are so far apart on our opinions that I doubt anything I say will sway you, but I really want to understand your position, because it makes so little sense at the most fundamental level.


I can't understand how you can say this.  Maybe you are stuck on the word "Injected" which means "introduced as an element or factor in or into some situation or subject" [based on Webster].
Surely at some point this issue was introduced into the source code.  Whether it was day 1, or with release 0.8, at some point it was.  What am I missing here?  I am not saying "intentionally".  I am not saying "maliciously".  I am saying that at some point it did not exist (it did not exist in 1990, for example), and at some point it did exist (it existed this week).  And therefore at some point it was introduced.  Help me understand the flaw in my logic whereby you would dismiss it with a hand-wave: "You don't [need?] to look further than..."


Not sure what the disagreement is here.  Perhaps you are saying that infants and people without computers cannot submit code.  I'll give you that, except that infants can grow up, and people without computers can go to the library.  
My point is that there is no filtering as to who can submit code changes.  This is a "feature" of open source, which is a two-edge sword.  In the case of a monetary system, where a code submission can be extremely profitable to a malicious coder, code review by a small number of lead developers isn't nearly enough. 




I am not sure why you keep bring up closed source.  A lot of people fall off ladders too.  Neither is relevant to this discussion.  I certainly am not advocating for closed source; I'm not sure why you are advocating against it (or whatever you are doing).


Still looking for that piece that isn't true.  Maybe my decades of work in security and software reliability has blinded me to something, so I am open minded to hear what I am missing.  Please enlighten me.


You're right, I didn't offer a single solution.  I offered many.  Sorry you missed them.  Maybe a recap would help you.
I believe that solutions need to be in multiple facets of the project:  1) prevention (of such issues), 2) detection and 3) reaction.
It's pretty much a fact of life that bugs will exist.  That's why we can't stop at number 1.  But solutions for number 1 are:
-  review of the code at ALL levels.  Keep in mind that bitcoin-related bugs can be introduced into the compiler or the OS.  (Several research projects have demonstrated how a C-compiler bug can be introduced which renders code reviews of Application code useless.)  
What this means is that the simpler the environment for critical systems, the less surface area for bugs and vulnerabilities.  That means that critical Bitcoin systems should be MINIMAL systems.  No extra libraries.  No additional components.  And ideally, the critical Bitcoin code should *verify* that it is running on a minimal system of tested components.  (You don't want a Flash bug to infect a mining system, as an example, since Flash is not a necessary component of a miner's rig.)
-  All changes should be tested thoroughly.  That means not only a test suite, but also a complete test environment, running, processing transactions.  Any real banking, trading, or financial environment would do this.  You'd want to be super careful about any change injected in the system.
...basically, the steps that a major corporation would take to perform appropriate testing and change control should be implemented in this environment.  It's not inventing something new - it's implementing proven techniques in an open source environment.
2) detection.  Careful consideration should be given to assess why it took "so long" to detect this issue.  I say that in quotes because relative to most open source projects, this was detected pretty quickly.  But consider how long the issue existed in the code base (weeks?  I'm not sure.)  and long it took when the bug cropped up, and perform an analysis as to how those times could be slashed.  Could it have been detected as soon as the fork occurred?  Could it have been detected in a test environment?
There are techniques to perform process analysis and improve these processes.  Major corporations do it all the time, and I'm sure many of the developers who are interested in Bitcoin besides myself have experience in these processes.
3) Reaction:  Once a bug is detected, somehow it needs to be squashed.  And (perhaps more importantly), the security of the monetary system needs to be kept intact, so that it can't be exploited.  Bugs will exist.  But if the right reaction systems are put into place, the window for exploitation can be reduced.
Several classes of tools can help reaction:  Communication tools (so the right people are notified immediately), Information tools (so the impact can be assessed).  Correction tools (so the window for exploitation can be reduced).
I don't have all the answers here, but imagine if the fork was detected,     
A) key people were notified (anyone who signs up to be notified?) within seconds,     
B) the impact of potential alternatives was immediately obvious to the decision makers in a report  (i.e. a list of attempted double-spends, a list of impacted transactions, a list of potential solution alternatives and their impact),      
C) a quick vote could be taken so the decision could be made quickly,     
D) A "kill switch" (or some other push-button resolution) was available, so that once a decision was made, each responsible party could immediately execute the chosen plan of action.
In theory, if this week's problem wasn't able to be avoided, it would have been ideal to be able to react within seconds.  How can that be achieved?  Or minutes?  That's the path we need to go down.
Does that help?

I think the simplest option is to use a clean PC (no viruses), open a private browsing window, and go to bitaddress.org.  Once the page has loaded, unplug from the internet and turn off wireless.
Generate a paper wallet, print it.  Power off the PC and Printer.  Now the paper copy is the only copy.  Make several copies.  Send money to the Bitcoin Address on the paper, while guarding the Private Key that is listed.
You can check the Bitcoin balance at anytime online.

The reason it dropped is because you can really only easily ESTIMATE the number of hashes per second based on the results.  It's an estimate, not fact.  And there's a margin of error.
Look at it this way.  Suppose I commissioned an army to flip coins, and to regularly report back any time they get a sequence of 10 heads in a row.  If I get reports telling me how long the sequences were, I can then estimate how many flips per second are taking place, based on the frequency of those reports, and the length of the reported sequences when they are reported.  
If I get a report of 17 heads in a row, I know that only happens every 2^17th flips, on average, and depending on how often I get that sort of report, I can estimate how frequently we're performing 2^17 flips.  But it's still an estimate.

@_date: 2013-05-23 21:35:29
This is true.  my math is based on random.
On the other hand, I think the common vanity method is for you to provide half of the key (and so you are choosing something random), and then they provide the other half.  and through the magic of ECDSA, the vanitygen provider website never gets to know the whole private key.
So, there is a random portion in the common method of generating vanity addresses.

It sounds like this is mostly a face-to-face transaction.
So if a customer wants to buy Bitcoins, they come to you and present you some cash and a Bitcoin Address (either in text or a QR code).  You go to YOUR secure computer (at the register), and pay his Bitcoin Address.
No need to worry about the public/cafe computers.  They can see the transfer without logging into any account by looking at Blockchain.info.
In fact, advise them NOT to sign into their financial accounts (banks, bitcoin, etc) on your computers.  The cool thing about Bitcoin is that you can see the transfer and account balance without revealing any credentials that allow spending of the Bitcoins.

Pooled miners aren't "creating more virtual currency".  They just plain aren't.  There is no rationalization here;  This is fact.
Amazon and Facebook are/were "creating virtual currency".  The FinCEN regulations were written for ALL virtual currencies; they weren't just Bitcoin regulations.
Miners are paid for performing the bookkeeping function of Bitcoin.  Mining POOLS provide the Bitcoin Address that gets put into the coinbase transaction, and mining pools pay the pooled miner.  And they don't even pay out 100%.  
Anyone who receives a bitcoin that is NOT part of the coinbase is NOT "creating a virtual currency", period.  Clearly, the virtual currency is already "created" before being given to the pooled miner (because it can only be given to the pooled miner after being confirmed 120 times).
There really isn't any doubt here, or even wiggle room.

A lot of good questions in this post.
Why don't we do away with fiat?  Fiat currencies have a long history, and people are used to it.  And governments like to be able to control their own fate by controlling the currency.   I suspect that most Bitcoin advocates would be in favor of doing away with fiat, but it's so engrained in society that it would take major upheaval for that to happen.
Make all banking transactions irreversible?  Good question.   Banking transactions tend to become irreversible with time (like 30 days, 90 days, etc), except when governments step in and un-do things, which has happened (seizing funds, reversing transactions, etc.)  The merits of this system can be argued, but the uncertainty and time delay make for an inefficient and imperfect, "untrustworthy" system.  Untrustworthy, in quotes, because that uncertainty and delay cause a slightly-less-than-100% certainty that I get to keep the money that I received.
Bitcoin has reduced that uncertainty time from months to an hour.  And supposedly increased the certainty much closer to 100% (although I can't prove this).
A service like Paypal that offers completely irreversible payments?  For a minute there I thought you were saying that Paypal offers irreversible payments, which I think has been proven false [numerous times](
But Western Union - well, good question.  Western Union definitely serves a purpose.  But the issue with Western Union is one of convenience because of the architecture.  They don't store money in "irreversible form", they just do what you said, move it in and out between reversibility and irreversibility.  And that switch is the time-consuming, risky part.  It's the same issue that people face when they try to buy Bitcoins - it's pretty hard and complicated, because it takes a lot of trust for me to take your reversible money and convert it to irreversible money.  So unless you are handing me cash (that I can prove to be non-counterfeited), it's a risk, so I will inject delay to minimize the risk.
Bitcoin provides a mechanism to keep money in the irreversible state, because it's a storage of value.  I can receive irreversible money, and then I can transmit it.  With Western Union, those two transactions would incur a switching delay (in and out of fiat).  Bitcoin removes that, by keeping money in the irreversible state.
Personally, I think there's a place for Bitcoin.  Will it rule the world, eliminating all fiat currencies?  I don't see that happening anytime in the next century.  Although once one currency falls, there will be a flight to safety, and it will cause a domino effect.  This might be 10 years from now or 300 years from now, but I think that will eventually happen.  (People are always amazed at the rate of change once change starts - like the Berlin Wall coming down).
@_date: 2013-03-18 15:34:00
Using a service provider, you can arrange to buy bitcoins through the CVS / Moneygram process.
It starts with you visiting bitinstant.com or ziggap.com.  You fill out a form on the website, and they walk you through where to take your cash or debit card.  It ends with you having Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-29 13:42:14
But it was **trivial** for you to implement a zero-trust model, one has to question why you didn't do it!  This is reason to distrust the service right there.  That means that you have a larger trust obstacle to overcome.
Just do exactly what you are doing, except make it a bitcoin wallet like bitaddress.org.  
If you are honest, you are probably trying to make a profit on lost or forgotten coins. If you are evil or incompetent, then **you potentially could do tremendous damage to the community**.

Our legal systems are based on precedent, so you pretty much have to use physical property analogies until you can come up with something different.
The flaw in your mineral deposit example is exposed with the quote you provided.  "available to whoever is willing to extract them", yet the example you gave was that the person who put the protection layer in place didn't perform the extraction, the extractor did.
Bitcoin theft case law will be interesting, that's for sure.  If tail-girl is recorded purchasing the Bitcoins, and you steal them, and she tracks you down, and files charges, she has evidence of ownership.  In the US, in a criminal trial against you, the State has the burden of proof, and they would need to prove that you stole them (and it's plausible that she sold you the private key).  Proving that negative would be difficult, but not impossible.
However, the standard for a civil case is not as stringent, and so I imagine she fairly easily could win a civil case, if she could track you down.
But somehow trying to justify your actions as ethical or legal is just kidding yourself.  It right up there with "I'm an apple shareholder, so I should be able to take from the apple store", or "he left the bike unlocked, so I assumed he didn't want it."  The justice system doesn't typically fall for loopholes.  Sorry.

My immediate concerns are 
1) randomness    
2) correctness of the Private Key for a Bitcoin Address that I use.
Do you have anything to allay those concerns?  
One early release of bitaddress.org, I believe was generating wallets that could never be cashed (wrong private key), so later, for testing, they ran through tens of thousands of test cases to verify that the right answers were coming up.  Have you done this sort of testing?

Logic, people.
Think about this:  The vast vast majority of people who hold Bitcoin right now believe in the long-term future of Bitcoin.  Maybe very near 100%.  That means that the vast vast majority will want to own as much Bitcoin as their personal portfolios can justify, given diversification goals, when that next block-halving event happens in about 35 months.
This means that it's likely that at least "the same amount" of money will be invested in Bitcoin in 35 months as is now - the two differences being the supply side (4.5M more Bitcoins issued - about +40%) and the "new" demand side (new interest as people increase their holdings or new people find out about Bitcoin.)
Now, people are just jostling to increase a percentage point or two.  Some are panic selling ("I should have gotten out at 135!  Oh well, I'll take 90.")  Others are trying the sell high, buy back lower trick, to increase their Bitcoin Balance (likely with the SAME amount of money or more!)  
But on average, the jostlers will likely sell and buy with the same amount of exposure to Bitcoin, speculating, trying to gain an advantage of a percent or two (or ten) here or there.  Some will succeed.  Others will fail.  Just like Vegas - the house wins, and *on average* gamblers lose.
But overall, people will want to be here for the next block-halving event, and want to be at least "as invested" as now.  
So then it comes down to ... will the "new interest" in Bitcoin over the next 35 months make up for the 40% increase in money supply?  I think this is a no-brainer.
That's why I generally choose not to try to gamble to get a little bit of an edge here or there.  I'm fairly confident I could take money from some of the panickers, but in general, I'm a buyer for the next 35 months.  Why screw around with the gambling, and let Gox make all the money?

The problem with email alerts (or any warnings) is that if they are too frequent, then they are ignored.  How many Helpdesk employees complain that the users just click past pop-up window warnings, because they are far too frequent?
We've written software for clients where we have actually had to resort to requiring the user to key in "irreversible" (rather than just click OK), when they are about to perform a destructive act.   Amazing how many helpdesk calls it eliminated.

Actually, if you want to get technical, it's completely possible to have an off-blockchain transaction.  For instance, I create a paper wallet and fund it (which would appear on the blockchain), and then I sell the paper wallet to my brother (which would not appear on the blockchain).
Many people think that SatoshiDice should do all of their transactions OFF the blockchain, and only pay out when someone cashes out.  A lot of online casinos operate this way.  But SatoshiDice clogs up the Blockchain with a lot of tiny transactions (which is safer for the individual gambler, in case SD gets shut down or someone breaks into their wallet).

I am not advocating creating a black hole address and throwing away Bitcoins, but I can tell you that this is not a difficult process to create a "provably black-hole" address (although, admittedly, you can't prove it at first glance; you have to do some math).
All you need to do is this:
1.  Take the hash of a recently created block (perhaps 10 blocks ago).  For instance, for the most recently created block's hash is 0000000000000156b56fb15fbdd42b33d9ef05f627ebdc74f81204de87bd0feb
2.  Turn that hash into a Bitcoin Address by using some math that you document, using all or part of the chart on [this page](
Example, you can consider the hash as the "public key" and derive a Bitcoin Address from that, and no one knows the private key.

This is good news!
This helps remove Mt. Gox as a single point of failure that can bring down Bitcoin.  And it's a REALLY fair way to price the exchange rate.
Note to would-be thieves:  To beat the system, add a bunch of very expensive items to your shopping cart.  Just before you press "buy with bitcoin", put in a huge bid at an exchange, to establish a favorable exchange rate.  Then press "buy with bitcoin", to establish the exchange rate.  Then cancel the bitcoin purchase on the exchange and wait 15 minutes.  If the price of bitcoins goes up, buy your merchandise.  If the price of bitcoins drops, cancel the transaction and do it again.
3.  ...   
4.  Profit.

If you are trying to figure out whether Bitcoin is the preferred currency of the internet, it seems like you would compare Bitcoin to Dollars, Euro, etc.  And it's not even a blip.
If you are trying to figure out whether Bitcoin is the preferred *payment method*, then you would compare it to Visa, MC, Paypal, eChecks, etc.  Again, Bitcoin is not even a blip compared to these.
However, if you measure year-over-year growth, in terms of number of sites that accept it, or in terms of volume of transactions, then you have an argument.  Bitcoin might have 5000% growth in the number of sites that accept it, compared to Visa +0.5% (a made up number).   Meaningful?  well... you compound that for a few years or decades, and yes, it becomes VERY meaningful.  Otherwise, not so much.

If you are a "buy and hold" type of buyer, then the time it takes to go through is no problem, because they honor the price at the time of the click (assuming they don't "fraud protect" you out of a transaction).
That's significantly different than transferring money from bank to Dwolla to Gox and buying then.  In Coinbase's case, you get today's price.  In Dwolla's case, you get next week's price.

Keep in mind that you are buying stock from someone who has the stock and can see the same financials, and is pricing their offer to take into account their feeling of whether it's a good deal to own the stock.
In other words, when you buy, there's someone at the other end that thinks that they are getting a good deal selling it.

I think you're exactly correct.     
I believe in Bitcoin to the point that I think that a purchase at $1000 right now would pay off in five years.  But I am not willing to pay $1000 for one Bitcoin, if I can pay $1000 for TEN. 
So part of my buying decision is "what is going to happen in the short run, and can I maximize my purchase?"  Gauging panic and other investor sentiment is part of that.  If everyone appears to be panicking, I may just step aside and let the price plummet for a while, and then scoop some up at the bottom.

It's really a demonstration of all "live" transactions.  Every transaction starts out as unconfirmed, and then (most every one) will eventually get confirmed.  If you watch that page for a short period, you will see one transaction after another, occurring somewhere in the world using Bitcoin.
Occasionally there's a case when someone sends a transaction with the wrong fee, and it remains unconfirmed for a long time.  But the point is that there are a lot of realtime transactions happening.

It's almost like "no one ever goes there, because it's too crowded".  Get a faster server (or servers), and people will use it more, and the bid/ask spread will come down, and that could lead CampBX to becoming the US alternative of choice.

"always about 4 years apart" ?  Incorrect.  
The block halvings are always 210000 blocks apart, and we are on block 254020.  so we are 20.96% of the way to our next block adjustment.
[Block 210000]( was on November 28, 2012.  
So if we went 20.96% in 269 days, you can project us to go through 100% of these second 210000 blocks in 1283 days, putting the next block adjustment on (around) **June 3, 2016** (or an adjustment in about 3.5 years, not 4).

This is nonsense.
Well, I suppose the flap of a butterfly's wings *can* result in price fluctuation, but there is nothing inherent about **saving** that causes price fluctuation.
Saving just means that people less Bitcoins are on the market, so people are bidding on a smaller amount.
I anticipate your response to be something like "yeah, but what happens when the hoarder dumps 10,000 BTC onto the market".  But that is not hoarding, that is selling.  And really, your objection then boils down to something like this:  "**Buying or selling** a lot of Bitcoins all at once causes price fluctuations."  which gets filed under the "no shit, Sherlock" file.

What makes confirmations "secure" is the amount of work that is performed as part of, and after, they have been confirmed.  This is because in order to "un-do" a confirmed transaction, you'd have to duplicate that amount of work.
ASIC miners can perform a tremendous amount of work relative to CPU/GPU miners.  But the question is really one of:  How many dollars would one have to spend to attack the network.  And the answer is that you would have to spend far less to attack Litecoin than to attack Bitcoin.
The math behind Litecoin is that an hour's worth of confirmations are far better than an hour's worth of Bitcoin confirmations, GIVEN THE SAME AMOUNT OF MINERS performing the same amount of work.  But because there is far more invested in Bitcoin mining gear than in Litecoin mining gear, the dollars necessary to overthrow the network isn't even close.  Litecoin is far behind Bitcoin in terms of certainty of confirmations.  Not even close.
Shoot, simply rent a botnet for an hour, and un-do a few transactions and see how that works out for Litecoin.
And frankly, development of an ASIC for Scrypt isn't that far-fetched either.  Just because there aren't ASICs now, doesn't mean there can't be ASICs.  There is nothing about Scrypt that makes it so that it can't be optimized using an ASIC.
But as long as people can pump up the value of Litecoin, then people will use Botnets to generate coins and keep it secure.  As soon as the sentiment changes, stand back and watch the coin dump!

Basically you take a block (a list) of unconfirmed transactions, along with a check sum from the previous block.  This looks like a bunch of binary digits (zeros and ones). 
Append to that a transaction that pays you the fees and block reward (currently 25 BTC, to whatever address you choose as the miner). 
So you have all this binary data.  Append one number of your choosing (usually a random number, called the nonce), and HASH all this stuff.  A "Hash" performs a complex summary on all this information, and spits out a result.
This result will be a series of zeros and ones as well.  But in order for you to successfully "solve" the block, your hash result must start with a certain number of binary zeros (making it a small number).  The greater the difficulty, the more leading zeros you need to have, to solve the block.
Imagine a hash generating an unpredictable result.  There's a 50% chance the hash result will start with a zero. There's a 25% chance that it will start with 2 zeros.  But at this point, you have to get a TON of leading zeros.  Like 45 or some ridiculous number.
So chances are, you didn't guess the right random number (called a nonce), and so you try again.  You keep doing this until someone solves the block.  By solving the block, you are performing a critical bookkeeping function that helps to confirm that money is spendable when people claim it is.  You are "locking in" those transactions.

I think you have to look at it like a 3-year investment (or longer), and, if you believe in them (and aren't just looking to take advantage of a "fad"), then just get in.  Don't pussy-foot around.  But only buy what you can afford to lose - this is a highly speculative investment.
However, if you are a little nervous, spread your $800 over multiple purchases over time.  Mt. Gox doesn't have a per-transaction fee, so there's no additional cost in breaking it up.  
Consider spending some cash now, and then putting in a bid at the current price minus $0.50 or something.  That way you get some now, and if there's a minor fluctuation, you'll get some more.    Check back in a day, and maybe adjust upward if you weren't able to buy.

You don't need to do step 5 to see the transaction.
Simply go to blockchain.info using the bitcoin address that you sent the coins to, and you can see them there.
For instance, 
If you want, you can create a wallet on Blockchain.info, and then add a "watch only" address of the bitcoin address on the left side of your bitaddress.org paper wallet.  
But once you key in your private key, the money can be spent, so you want to hold onto that, and not expose it to the internet.

There are some sites that do name shortening (like    --  a BEAUTIFUL URL!).  I actually wrote one and ran it for a short while, and no one really cared.
The issues that people cited to me were:      
1. How do I know you aren't going to swap out my bitcoin address and put your own in?    
2. How do I know hackers won't attack my account and put their address into my spot?    
3.  I don't want to have just ONE bitcoin address.  I want it to change regularly, like you're supposed to for privacy.    
Another idea, similar though, is to have a bitcoin address file on every domain, like:    [sample link for illustration only.  It goes no where].  
I think there could be a convention that lets you retrieve a bitcoin address to send to, for that domain.   Then people could control it themselves, and it would be as secure as their own website is (for better or worse).

No.  The regulations are very clear in that if you CREATE virtual currency and then sell it, you need to register.  
However, if you buy virtual currency, receive virtual currency in trade or for goods or services, or spend virtual currency in a transaction, then you are merely a user and are not subject to registration.
Pooled miners provide services and receive virtual currency in exchange for those services (the service being hash power).  They are paid for the service.  Therefore they are a user, and not subject to registration.
There's no possible way to claim that someone who receives bitcoins that were in possession of someone else "created" them.  And this is what pooled miners receive.   
The "coinbase transaction" - the first transaction in every single block, which assigns 25 Bitcoins (at the current levels) to someone - clearly denotes someone other than the pooled miner.  Those coins go to someone (usually the pool organizer), who pays the pool miners.

Actually the lowest price that was traded on the open market was $0.062.  [(Chart)](
And the volumes were small.
Had you bought ALL of the coins sold in Sept 2010 (7.917K per day, or 237.5K) for $0.062, you would have paid $14,725, and now (at $75), it'd be worth $17.8M.  But again, it wouldn't have been possible to be on the buying end of every transaction for the month.
EDIT: fixed it.
@_date: 2013-02-14 18:22:02
The direct answer to your question is that you SEND money from coinbase to your new Bitcoin Address listed on the bitaddress.org printout.
Then you keep that private key a secret!  The Bitcoin Address is like a bank account number for deposit only.  You can share it.
The Private Key is your ATM card, Pin, Debit card, and signature all wrapped on one.  It lets the holder spend your account.

Sounds great in principle, until you think hard about it.  Since most of the bitcoin exchanging is speculative right now, rather than transactional, that means that (generally speaking) for most of the transactions, you have a buyer who is betting it will go up in the short term, and a seller who is betting it will go down.
This is very similar to betting on ball games in Vegas.   And in that case, you can calculate the Expected Return for the average gambler, and it's negative.  In other words, by participating in gambling, on average, you "expect" to lose a little on each bet, statistically speaking.
So yeah, there may be some outliers, but for the most part, the average Bitcoin speculator will be about average, meaning the constant churn will generally cost him money.  The expected winner is Mt. Gox and the exchanges.
Another way to look at it is to consider the person with a lot of Bitcoins (which can represent an aggregation of all speculators).  When they sell, they move the price down, *while they are selling at the market price*.  When they buy, they moving the price up *while they are buying*.  So they are selling for less and less, and buying for more and more.  And they need to cover the exchange commission.  So it's a bad deal.  (There are studies that show this.)

The difficulty adjusts based on the past success of block discovery, but [the difficulty adjustments]( lag slightly from the actual success.   So, as more hashing is added to the network, the average time decreases.  The weighting of recent block discoveries doesn't cause radical swings in the difficulty level (presumably to avoid an oscillation effect).
As the rate of new hashing hardware increases, you can expect the average block discovery time to decrease.  If the rate levels off, then the average block time will eventually return to about ten minutes.

Just to be clear here, if you are new to mining (bookkeeping), don't try to do it for the money without investing in specialized equipment.
Basically, running mining on your PC "GPU" will cost you more in electricity than the pennies you can make on it.   Running it using a good graphics card might make you a few more pennies a day, but you will be lucky if your revenues exceed your electricity costs in the short term, and in a month or two, it just won't be possible if you have normal electricity costs (i.e. not subsidized by a landlord or employer or something).
There are Specialized machines that perform bookkeeping much more cost-effectively (ASICs - application specific Integrated circuits - are much easier on the electric bill, per bitcoin payment).
Don't think you are going to get rich mining on your PC.  You may want to do it for the learning experience (or, while you are wait-listed for an ASIC machine), but it's not a get-rich-quick scheme.
@_date: 2013-02-18 23:11:48
Yeah, I believe that it's possible to attempt to correct it.  But with a determined, powerful foe with 51%, this sort of attack could create all sorts of chaos and uncertainty.  They could even "give away" their newly minted coins so that people actually resisted the correction.
Having "everyone switch to a new release" would be an extremely difficult challenge when there's free money floating around, with incentive not to.
I'm not saying it's a likely scenario, but it IS possible.  so "mathematically impossible" goes right out the window with "it's mathematically impossible to win the lottery" (yet people do all the time).

The bitcoin price isn't "set", per se.  People who want bitcoins say how much they are willing to pay (called bids).  And people who have bitcoins say how much they are willing to accept (called asks).

Oh yeah? how did you get this "new" wallet?  with a pass phrase?
It's widely believed that if you create a purely random private key, there's virtually zero chance that it will have been used before.  However, the trick is that it has to be random. 
If you used something that was an inferior random number generator, then this is possible.
Also, by the way, make sure that you don't have that key imported into your wallet... You wouldn't want to get change sent to that address - someone might take your change.

3) Log into the new account, and import the old paper wallet private address to the account.      
4) pay whomever I was wanting to pay.     
5) pay the remainder to another address - either my bitcoin-QT address, or another paper wallet (perhaps the one created in step 1)     
6) verify that all transactions get confirmed.     
7) never again use the old paper wallet or the blockchain.info wallet.

It might put it in perspective to look at the "log graph" over time.  Here are two, one for the [last 6 months]( and one for the [last year](

Hmm..   It seems that multi-factor authentication would be a good idea.  So we want a private key based on at least 2 of these factors:  what you know, what you are, and what you have.
If we are worried about what you know due to the coma, then we have to go with the other two.
Maybe there's a way to attach a device to a person, such that if it were removed without the person's cooperation, it would be rendered useless.  I'm thinking of a dye-pack with part of your key on it, that you swallow, so if someone removes it while you're in a coma, the dye pack goes off.
Or maybe a lens could be implanted in each eye, and half of the key could be on each lens.  So you could see the key when you wake up, but no one else could see it.  There's the risk of collusion between the two eye surgeons, so you may need to kill at least one of them.
Using your DNA as your private key would seem to be a good idea, but it's too accessible to others while you are in the coma.

Pyramid scheme and Ponzi scheme are not the same thing.
From [Wikipedia](
A pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a mistaken belief in a nonexistent financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return. However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes:[1]
In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a "hub" for the victims, interacting with all of them directly. In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly. (In fact, failure to recruit typically means no investment return.)
A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach and often attracts well-to-do investors; whereas pyramid schemes explicitly claim that new money will be the source of payout for the initial investments.
A pyramid scheme typically collapses much faster because it requires exponential increases in participants to sustain it. By contrast, Ponzi schemes can survive simply by persuading most existing participants to reinvest their money, with a relatively small number of new participants.

Actually, it's not as much as you might think.
I'll give an absurd example to demonstrate my point, and you can extrapolate it from there.  
Suppose some REALLY good news came out, like, say the US Government said "We support bitcoin, and we are going to peg the dollar to one one-thousandth of a bitcoin."  Instantly every seller at $120 or $140 or $400, or anything under $1000/bitcoin  pulls their sell order.  Why sell for less?
Then one person buys .001 bitcoins for $1000/BTC.
At that moment, exactly $1 flowed into the young market.  Yet it jumped from $100 to $1000.
(the point being that a Billion Dollars may not have flowed in, to take it to $100.)

With insider trading:  People buy shares on the open market, and their value goes to zero.  People lose money.  But people lose LESS money, because of the selling pressure thanks to the CEO selling. And if people notice that the CEO is selling, then presumably some will take that as a negative sign and not buy, and so the price is even lower for those who do buy.  
So, yeah, your logic really doesn't support your argument.  Buyers are actually BETTER OFF if insider trading is permitted.
I'm not an advocate for insider trading, but I am an advocate of free and efficient markets.  I am really just trying to understand, and enjoy playing devil's advocate.
Don't think for a moment that the current situation isn't a rigged game - people have more information than you.

Hey, not a problem.  If the sidebar doesn't answer the questions (and it's pretty overwhelming), come back and ask away... people here are always willing to help.
There's also a thread in here almost daily asking just about the same thing, so you may want to search.
It helps knowing where in the world you are, and how much you are trying to buy ($10?  $100?  $1000?  $10,000?)
Also, is anonymity critical?  Because there are places, like bitcoin-brokers (ack, I can't believe I would mention them!), that claim to protect anonymity.  And localbitcoins.com

Holy crap, have you thought of the implications to the person who might be holding lots of bitcoins and not wanting to declare a bitcoin capital gain to the IRS?  They could actually use their Bitcoins to buy stuff that they were going to buy anyway, and replace their Bitcoins at today's price, establishing a new basis for future taxes!  AND circulate Bitcoins, which can only help the economy and the Bitcoin price.

I would have to disagree, although I can only base this on my research.
Brainwallet standardization has been a topic of conversation [for over a year](  Since then, *most* "in the wild" brain wallet generators converged to the same standard, while other standards (such as [BIP 23, Heirarchial Deterministic Wallets]( have been proposed - I believe with some implementations.  
Meanwhile, other notable figures in the Bitcoin community have proposed other standards for Brain Wallets (such as [Mike Caldwell](  Presumably these will be (or are being) [implemented](
In summary, old brain wallets were not all the same standard.  A standard emerged.  And a new standard has already been proposed.  So I think that I'd disagree with your statement of:


That's why I originally stated it the way I did - that brain wallet algorithms are following a standard [now].   But I don't believe this was always the case, and the standard is evolving.
I certainly haven't examined the universe of brain wallets, to see if they are all the same, but comments requesting standardization have appeared as long ago as March 2012:


Now it looks like this thread mystery is pretty well solved, which was exactly as I said - that no one had to sign into blockchain.info to access a poorly secured brain wallet.

Just nitpicking, but the 21-millionth bitcoin isn't finally mined in 2021.  By 2021, there will be approximately 18,703,125 Bitcoins (give or take a few, depending on what blocks get solved around New Years Eve).

Market Cap is really the wrong term.  It's really called the [monetary base](

I think it'd be very difficult to come out with an exact clone that has any chance of success.  The reason being exactly what OP said:


An exact clone will not have the millions of dollars of investment behind it, nor the vendor acceptance.  It may have the attraction of the "get rich quick" folks, who think they missed the last opportunity, but that's just a pyramid if there's no substance.  That's like Multi-Level Marketing without a real product - a race to sign up other suckers.
A clone with an added value has a chance, but the value has to overcome the momentum and network effect of Bitcoin.  If "the market" determines Litecoin's dubious distinction to have sufficient merit, then Bitcoin will either a) be surpassed and potentially die, b) co-exist, or c) adapt the features.  I think it would take a lot to cause bitcoin to die from a competitor.  But it happened to MySpace, CompuServe, WordPerfect, Alta Vista, and countless other market innovators over the years.

Rick, your articles are always great, and they've influenced and clarified my opinions.
I got into a debate with a friend not too long ago, who was arguing that the rising US debt was a huge problem, and I tried to defend this position:  "It's not debt that is bad;  If the US has the World Reserve Currency, and people want to lend the US money for dirt cheap, the US should take all the dirt cheap money that they can, and SOLIDIFY their position as the World Reserve Currency."
Admittedly I was drinking and feisty, and trying to be argumentative just for to have a little fun... but I ended up convincing myself.  It's not the huge debt that's a problem, it's the fact that the US will eventually lose the coveted World Currency position, at which point, it will all come crumbling down.  Debt isn't the problem; it's how we are spending the money that is being invested in the US that is the problem, which will have an ugly conclusion...

I should add, your FIRST concern should be:  How are you going to safely secure your bitcoins.  I tell you, it's no fun to buy $2500 of bitcoins, and have them immediately stolen.  So do your homework here as well.
My advice:  If you are buying them purely for investment purposes, get a paper wallet.  I believe this is a pretty safe procedure:
1.  go to a computer with no viruses.  Open a Private Browsing window (incognito, private... it's called different things depending on the browser).    
2.  go to  and let the web page load.  Move your mouse randomly as instructed, for about 10 seconds.    
3.  unplug from the internet, and turn off wireless    
4.  press the button to generate a new address a few times, if you'd like.        
5. When you are happy with the Bitcoin Address, print the page, or copy the information down.  The idea is to never let the Private Address be keyed in or spotted on the internet.    
6.  Once you have the information, power off the PC, and back on.  Then presumably all traces of the Private Key are erased except the one you have on paper.    
If you do this, then you can make copies of that paper, store it in multiple places, and send Bitcoins to the Bitcoin Address (without ever revealing the Private Key).
When you want to spend them someday, it's just a matter of finding a website that allows you to import your Private Key (such as Mt. Gox or Blockchain.info, or one of several clients).
Edit:  Rats, I just read the part where you said you want to buy something with Bitcoin this week.  Paper wallets are good LONG term storage, and you may want to do that for the bulk of your purchase.  For spending money, you still want to investigate safe storage.  Look at the wallet options on  .  There are several options - probably Electrum or Armory would be the easiest for you to get started with - or an online wallet like blockchain.info.

You said that well.
Inflation is a hidden tax that politicians can deny responsibility of.
The other way that the "deflation is bad" argument falls flat on its face is that each transaction has two parties.  They say no one will want to spend money if it's more valuable tomorrow.  But that implies that no one will want to hold onto goods because they will be worth less tomorrow.  So a fair price is met in the middle.
You could take the "deflation is bad" argument, and argue the exact point for "inflation is bad".  In an inflationary environment, why would you sell something today, if you could get more money tomorrow?  Everyone will stop selling stuff.  (yeah right)

AHA!   I just got to learn something new - verifying a message using Bitcoin-Qt!
**Instructions for anyone who wants to try this**
In Bitcoin-Qt, from the menu, select File / Verify message
In the first box, put the bitcoin address    
In the second box, put the message    
Julian702 is Tuxavant
In the third box, put the signature:


Press Verify Message, and you can see that the person who owns the address wrote the message.  Way cool.
I knew it could be done, but that's the first time I did a verification.

Taking the other side of that trade is not just a bet that Mt. Gox will get their act together.  It's a bet that the 10% gap will narrow, due to any number of factors (such as an increased MARKET PERCEPTION that Mt. Gox *may* get its act together, or perhaps a difficulty in getting money out of other exchanges might increase, causing the gap to narrow.)

Keep in mind that the "hour to perform a transaction" compares to the "90 days it takes to perform a credit card transaction" - the amount of time when you can be pretty certain that it's not going to get reversed or charged back.
You rarely concern yourself with that period.  What you really care about is the seconds it takes to accept the transaction (scan a QR code or swipe a credit card).  Those times are comparable too.

I'd love to read this report.
A few questions come to mind:  
- What percent of his/her net worth was tied up in Bitcoin?    
- What percent of holdings did he/she sell?    
- Why did he give up on Bitcoin so early?   (I would hope that he held 
onto half or more).     
- Approximately what amount of fiat currency did he get for this?
I think if I were an early adopter and had 400K in Bitcoins, presumably valued at over $4M, I would have liquidated a lot as well.  As much as I believe in Bitcoin, that'd be too many eggs in one basket.
I am less interested in WHO it is, although I would like to know the profile of the person.  Is it a 24 year old Linux geek?   A 16 year old in his parents' basement?  A 35 year old surfer dude?  Larry Ellison?
@_date: 2013-02-23 19:23:38
I agree, but it's probably significantly less than 0.1% of the way there. 
There are probably two measures of "de facto internet currency":    
- percent of the number of transactions using this payment method (or currency)    
- size-weighted percent of transactions using this payment method (or currency).  In other words, percent of the volume of money of the transactions.
I suspect that Bitcoin isn't even a blip on the radar, as compared to different payment systems (Paypal, visa, MC, amex, etc.) or different currencies (USD, Euros, Yen, etc).  Maybe ten times as big as a year ago (thanks satoshiDice!), maybe fastest GROWING, but not even on the radar of the leaders.

Correct, so I think I didn't communicate my point very well.
Falkvinge's point was that the price should be at $1.12, and that manipulation has taken it 2 orders of magnitude higher.
My counter point was that the price is 2 orders of magnitude higher due to other factors (mainly buy-and-hold speculators), and that the price manipulation is fluctuating the price AROUND the 2-orders of magnitude  mark.
@_date: 2013-07-05 13:01:22
I don't think your math works out.  We're below the $1B market cap right now, and to maintain $1B market cap at $20/BTC, you'd need to have 50M Bitcoins issued.  Maybe you meant that the market cap never dips below $100M.
Log graphs are tough to extrapolate the axes values, but my "trollcast" is more like:  Market bottom at about the middle of September at about $30, for a market cap of about $30x12M = $360M.

1.  The value has little to nothing to do with the electricity necessary to mine.  If anything, it's the other way around.  
The value is really in the utility of the currency, and its popularity, and prospects for being the "next big thing".  With each new site that accepts Bitcoin, and with each day that it is successful, the likelihood increases.  With each hack and bad news, the likelihood may decrease.
ASICs provide more strength to the network.  The more strength, the less likelihood that it will be hacked, and the greater likelihood it will succeed (in many people's minds).  So I'd say that ASICs add to the likelihood of success, hence the price increase.
Frankly if bitcoin is the "next big thing", i.e. "facebook" level of ubiquity, then it is severely undervalued.  But that's a BIG "if".
2:  There has been a lot of good news, and not so much bad news.  And a lot more people have become interested or familiar with Bitcoin.
I would argue semantics with the other answer I see "More people want to buy, and fewer people want to sell", because this just isn't correct as worded.  It doesn't have to do with the quantity of people.  It has to do with the price that the buyers and sellers mutually agree to.

This is false.   You can spend it on SatoshiDice.  You just need to send the coins to a satoshiDice address.

I tried to figure this out once - why Slashdot hates bitcoin.
To me it seemed like an obvious fit for Slashdot to love: a well-thought-out implementation merging several known technologies (crypto, digital signatures, P2P), along with some new concepts (block chain, script language built into the blockchain, merkel trees - new to me) addressing a real world problem (simple transfer of value across the internet.  I
It also touched into some other problems, several of which have wide-spread impact (manipulated currencies, high transaction fees,  corrupt governments, transaction blocking by governments and banks, transaction fraud, and unexpected reversals).
Instead, it created a bunch of very vocal haters, separated into several groups: 
1.  Some thought it was a ponzi scheme, or were jealous that others got in first.     
2.  Some tried to apply everything they know about X and tried to find holes in it:   (deflationary arguments, 21 Million isn't enough, blockchain will get bloated, it'll never handle the transaction volumes, confirmation slowness, etc.)     
Slashdot has some very smart people, many who fired arrows at Bitcoin's early implementation.  That's how a product gets better.  I think they forgot that Beta doesn't mean final.  And they got bitter (generally).
Bitcoin is NOT perfect, but the people who bought into the vision became too vocal one way, and the skeptics found every reason to hate it.
I guess if you work for a bank, the financial industry, or the government (which is what, 50% of the population?), you can naturally feel threatened and look for fault in Bitcoin, because it calls attention to real issues in your field.
I learned about Bitcoin on Slashdot, and am thankful for that.

Bitpay isn't a party to disputes between the customer and the merchant.
If you are dealing with a trustworthy merchant, this isn't a problem.  Most trustworthy merchants (Macy's, WalMart) pretty much accept returns, no/few questions asked.  So trustworthy merchants can gain a substantial profit improvement by accepting Bitcoin instead of credit cards.
If you are dealing with a non-trustworthy merchant, then use an escrow service.

If a miner has a $10,000 interest in Bitcoins - that is, owns $10,000 worth - and he mines $1000 worth of additional Bitcoins, that is considered to be new interest of $1000.
If someone owns $20,000 of bitcoins, and decides to buy $5000 more, that's $5000 of new interest.
If someone never heard of Bitcoin, and hears about it, and buys $3000 worth, that's $3000 of new interest.

tips:       
1)  put at least half of that onto a paper wallet. Spread the risk.  Consider using other well-funded, reputable online services (Coinbase?), particularly in other countries.
2) use the yubikey and not the google version of two factor.  (I hear the google software uses a cookie on your PC which makes it vulnerable.  Not sure how much I believe that.)   
3) Make sure you have 2-factor on the Security Center setting (the 3rd one... on the right.  As I recall, the first setting is for logging in, the second one is for withdrawing, and the 3rd one is for changing any security including the 1st and 2nd one.)  Not having it on the 3rd one is like not having it on any of the other ones (once someone is logged in, or once you are logged in and get bit by a hack/virus/zero-day).
4)  Check to make sure there are no other authorizations (specifically API), if you aren't using them.  There's a trojan that is enabling the API, and then stealing bitcoins.  Don't fall for it.

Sorry, I wasn't trying to insult bctip (especially if you are affiliated).  Maybe "official looking" is the wrong terminology.  I utilized bitaddress.org's paper wallet feature, along with a typed letter of explanation of Bitcoin and how it works.
Understand that I did this long before bctip was available (I first heard of it in April).  I was giving $20 tips to professionals (which was more than 1 Bitcoin at the time).  And so I prepared an intro letter which I have used many times, and a paper wallet.  I told them they could use this paper wallet for more storage (and I would keep or destroy a backup, at their preference, but not to rely on me as their backup except as a last resort), or they could move it. The letter explained that if I didn't see a withdrawal or another deposit by a certain date, then I'd assume that they weren't interested, and I would reclaim.
The whole reason I did the paper wallet was to show them how Bitcoin works (Bitcoin address, cold storage, etc.)  Anybody I have introduced to Bitcoin (about 30 people), I showed them cold storage from the outset.
I figured $20 to a professional was an amount that made it within the realm of "worth their while", whereas $3 to a waitress is like getting a coupon in the paper.
I think bctip obscures some of the nuances of Bitcoin (since the redemption code doesn't look like a bitcoin address, adding one more long number for them to ask questions about.)  But I would consider that for the future.

It would take quite a while to effectively convert 1M Bitcoins.  Say I liquidated over the course of 1 year:
I would instantly fund as many Bitcoin businesses as I could, and the Bitcoin Foundation.  Get as many smart people working on ALL aspects of this project as possible.  
I would put bids and asks into the second and third largest Bitcoin exchanges to make sure that they always offered better deals on both sides of the transaction than Mt. Gox, trying to add competition in that field, and reduce the "single point of failure".
The more smart people working on Bitcoin related businesses (more exchanges, more side businesses, more pick and shovels), the higher the probability of success of Bitcoin, and therefore the more I can cash out for.

Bitcoin has fundamentals.  In the same way that Gold has a certain utility, Bitcoin has a certain utility, in that it's able to allow the transfer of wealth across distances without a middleman, and store a great deal of wealth at very little cost.  (Admittedly, the exchange rate of both gold and Bitcoin far exceed the utility value.)
Yeah, there's literally nothing there.   Owning bitcoins is just an entry in a ledger.
Your third sentence is contradicted by your fourth, but I know what you are saying.  However, there are features that Bitcoin has over alt-coins, namely the strength of the network (both mining and merchant).  When analyzing the strength of one coin over another, you need to look at not only the fundamental design, but also the cost to disrupt it.  The Litecoin ecosystem can be disrupted with one botnet attack right now.  It'd be very expensive to try to do that with Bitcoin.

You might be simplifying just a bit.
A piece that is missing is an automated way for the bitcoin buyer to tell a third party what address they want the bitcoin sent to, in advance of the transaction, and then a mechanism to pass that information *safely* on to the seller of the Bitcoin. 
The reason you can't check after the fact is that a thief can lie.  If the thief is the bitcoin buyer, he simply tells the seller to send it to address "A", and then complains to eBay that the Bitcoins never arrived at address "B" as requested.  If the thief is the bitcoin seller, he simply ignores the buyer's request to transfer them to "X", and transfers the bitcoin to his own address "Y", and then "proves that he did the transfer" by showing the blockchain.

I think the easiest way to help people understand this concept is to remind them how bad life would be if, every payday, you were handed a stack of coins and bills ("to put in your pocket") instead of just incrementing your bank account through direct deposit.
And remind people that in 1970, if you told them that you would take a letter and transport it instantly anywhere in the world, it would be difficult for the 1970's person to figure out what you would do with the atoms.  No, you are converting it to information, and sending it over a wire.

There are several things going on.  One is that it takes a long time for people to go from "I heard something about that" to "I am going to buy Bitcoins" to actually being able to buy them (thanks to queues at Mt Gox, etc.)
The other is that it takes a long time for infrastructure to build up, including bitcoin businesses, ATMs, commerce sites accepting Bitcoin, etc.
Both of these items are very much in the "early adopter" stage.  That means that the number of successes in both of these will accelerate, as things go main-stream.
There is a belief that if Bitcoin takes off in a big way, then the quantity limits will drive the price up.  (Do the math.  Say 210 M people want to have $100 worth of Bitcoins for "spare change" to conduct online commerce.) That's the $1000 Bitcoin mark.  Obviously bigger math drives bigger numbers.
And each day, we are advancing both of the critical items - getting people familiar with Bitcoin, and getting infrastructure in place.
So each day of advancement without set-back means another day of marching toward $1000.  Means a slight increase in the probability that the $1000 numbers above are achievable.  Once it's nearly a sure thing that those numbers are achievable, then the price will be at $1000.

OK, change my terminology from "Tx" to "Block"...
If a spend was in Block 101 (or 3200**101** or whatever), and then another spend was in Block 151, would the clients need to look through Blocks 102 to 150?
I meant to say Blocks all along... not sure why I said "Tx".

Using your argument, though, mBTC should be more valuable than silver as well.  Wait... Satoshis should be more valuable than silver.  In fact, a satoshi should be more valuable than a warehouse of silver!  Because in each of those cases, you don't have to store or guard it.
Your reason really doesn't explain the rationale for why one arbitrary unit of Bitcoin should be more valuable than a different arbitrary unit of a different commodity.
You just can't boil it down to something as simple as what you said.  The real answer concerns the availability of the commodity (supply) and the perceived usefulness of it (demand).

This reminds me of something that is on my list of Smart Phone apps to build.  I call it "Ellison" (named after Larry Ellison:  I read in a book that he dreamed of a way that rich people could efficiently pay others to pass them in line.)
Imagine if Larry Ellison went to the DMV to renew his drivers license.  He's 25th in line.  His smart phone communicates with all other smart phones in line, negotiating a rate to pass people.  The next number gets called, and it's Larry.  Meanwhile, the 24 people in front of him receive their "going rate" to be passed in line.
Same applies at Disney World:  you want to pass people?  You pay to pass them.  Airline TSA frisk line?  In a hurry? buy your way to the front of the line, seamlessly.
I think that'd be a cool app.  All bitcoin driven.
(I know I'd take a Bitcoin to be passed in line!  Maybe even 0.1 Bitcoins)

Not sure if this is of value to anyone, but I thought I'd put together a little Javascript / AJAX balance checker.  Feel free to borrow or steal the code.
Basically, you put the Bitcoin Account or the FirstBits into the query string, and out pops the balance, along with an estimate value in US dollars.
Conversion to other currencies is an exercise left to the reader.
Edit:  Of course, it's dependent on the reliability of blockchain.info's API.

It's really not that weird.  If you look at [this screen shot]( from Theymos, you can see that as he was mining in the early days with the standard Bitcoin Client, it just created a new address for each mined coin.
In addition, if you consider that he mined 27 blocks over roughly 8 days (blocks 38754-40212), you could estimate his portion of the hash power was 26/1457 (discounting the starting block found, since we don' t know how long he was looking prior to that), or about 1.78%, or 1/56.
So there were about 56 fulltime-miner-equivalents (of Theymos' power) in Feb 2010 (13 months after mining started).  I am assuming here that Theymos was mining fulltime during this period.
I'm sure many of these miners came and went, powered off on occasion, or whatever.  But it's still possible that a stash of these mined coins sit in individual wallets as a group like this.  Theymos' bitcoins appear to be 27 different addresses, but he could spend them all at once (if they weren't already spent) with one transaction from that wallet.

As a backup, you can give 1 or 2 pieces of the 6 to less-trusted people. Or have backups for your primary 4 people.

The US Government is the current "gold standard" for lack of a better term, in money. 
I'm one of the most anti-federal-debt guys there is, but if I were in charge, and there were countries including China bidding up the price of the T-Bills (i.e. bidding DOWN the interest rate that I need to pay them back at), I would be taking their money too!  
(The difference is, I would be investing it in a way to make sure that ten years from now, the US was STILL the "gold standard" in money.)
Anyway, as soon as the US loses that position as the Gold Standard, all shit's gonna hit the fan.  T-Bills will be going for less at auction (or not purchased at all), interest rates will spike, and the US will need to print much more money to pay back all the debt it's incurred.   And so inflation will be nuts.
So, yeah, the US should be nervous.  Because someone will knock it from it's exclusive position.  Might be China's currency.  Might be Bitcoin (in a loooooong time).

That would be a good adjustment.  
I think a better one would be to graph the monetary base (what some people call the market cap).  It wouldn't be a flat 39-cent adjustment.  It would recognize the inflation **rate** a little better.  50 coins every 9 minutes in 2011, when there were only 6 million coins, is hugely different (percent-wise) from 25 coins every 8 minutes on 11 million.
Second adjustment would be to toss it on a log graph.

The chart shows what [some call "market cap"]( or technically what is probably more accurately called [monetary base](  It's a measure of how much wealth is stored in Bitcoins.  You can calculate it by multiplying [the number of coins that have been mined]( times the [current price](
As Bitcoin becomes more trusted, more people buy into it, and more wealth is stored in Bitcoins.  But there's a bit of a hype-cycle, where Bitcoin gets a lot of press, people check it out, price rises, more people hear about it because of the price rising, and a bubble sort of forms.  Then it peaks, has a little crash, and slowly burns off steam until it returns to relative obscurity.  You can see those cycles in the graph...   Like in April 2011, the market cap (blue line) was on the red line... then it started an 80-day journey upward (primarily because the price jumped up).  Then it peaked, and then started a 163-day journey downward (again, primarily due to the price dropping).  Until it hit the red line again, and got support.  Then another cycle started.
You can see the average length of those last 4 cycles, and if you look at the last peak (April 10 2013, I believe), and count out about 158 days (the average length of past down-cycles), you get to sometime around Sept 20 2013).  You can then calculate what the "market cap" would be on that day, if it was at the red line.  You can do this by estimating the number of coins that will exist at that point, and doing the math to determine the red line market cap value, and then divide market cap by number of coins to get price per coin.
And the price on Sept 20, works out to be about $50.
Of course, this is all guesswork, and who the hell knows.  Another scenario that would still fit onto this methodology is that the "down period" is 158+30 days, in which case, the bottom price would work out to be about $58.  
Or it may never repeat this pattern again!

I agree.  You can see a 15% per month growth rate of the low-points for the past 2 years (putting us at no lower than $16 per share in March '13).  Basically, this is a doubling (of the bottom) every 5 months.  At that continued rate, it would be at over $8000/BTC in 48 month (the "5" years that he mentions - really 4).
You can't tell if the halving of the block reward doubled the doubling pattern, so that it now quadruples every 5 months, but that's what it looks like happened since December.  If we're on that path, then we better start talking about the price of a mBTC or a satoshi, and not the price of a Bitcoin!
Of course, nothing good lasts forever... so don't agree to buy that porsche yet.

No that is not illegal structuring.
The question is whether your balance in a foreign bank was, at anytime during the year, $10K or greater.  You are merely using the foreign bank as a transfer agent to Bitcoin.

I'm totally OK with your interpretation.
The interpretation that seemed to be common when the FinCEN guidance was originally published was that "creators" of virtual currency had to register, and that meant Miners.   It certainly means Facebook or Amazon for their coins, I would think.  But I really don't think that Miners create currency (as you said), and CERTAINLY pooled miners don't (since their trickle is paid from some existing currency).
I guess we'll find out some day when they try to make an example out of someone.

Feel free to test this, but it's been tested and discussed.
This attack still relies on a race to get the second transaction widely spread on a different part of the network, because no miner or regular node will accept the second transaction, if they already have received a first spend.

Agreeing with you, but adding more comments for the OP:
It's also worth mentioning that if you plan to "move up to an exchange" someday, you may want to start the process sooner, rather than later.
Verification backlogs and wait times often limit your ability to take quick action.  Some require you to be a registered user for a month before you can really use the site fully.

I agree, but CATALOG software isn't built that way.
Bitpay adjusts the price automatically, but the issue is that people are trying to use existing, unmodified catalog software to show both USD and BTC, without auto-conversion.
This is a short-term issue.  As soon as catalog software is adjusted to handle multiple currencies, or as soon as BTC becomes the de facto standard, this will not be an issue.  In the meantime, you have to tolerate crappy catalog software that doesn't auto-magically "change the price" as you claim that it does.  Small matter of programming, but it's not there yet and that was exactly my point.

Another thing to remember is that someone may not need to sign into your blockchain.info account to access the brainwallet.
Two possibilities:
1) brain wallet algorithms are following a standard, so if someone  could repeat this elsewhere (either due to a flaw in the algorithm, a flaw in the implementation, or a flaw in your password or security) then they wouldn't need to log in, so your logs would show nothing.
2)  if your wallet backup file were compromised in some way, then the same thing could take place.  They grab your private key and import it into their wallet, and again, you wouldn't see a login.

The statistical analysis proves what I have believed.
Basically, the closure of the Dwolla money pipe added significant friction.  In the past, I could (hypothetically speaking, of course) move a few hundred thousand dollars from my bank to Dwolla to Mt. Gox to Bitcoin in $9K chunks (or back again) without ever crossing the "$10K in a foreign bank" red-flag line, requiring extra filings and attention from my Uncle, Sam.
Now, you either sit tight, or move it via complex and slow bank transfers, or do extra filing with the government, or use CampBX, or use services aimed at smaller volumes (CoinBase or localbitcoins).  Friction has been added to the process, which naturally would cause a decline in transactions for participants greater than $10,000.
This also makes me question what happens when the friction is removed.  Removal of the friction could encourage deposits or withdrawals (or both), but will definitely encourage volume.
Personally, I think there is major pent-up demand in the US to be able to operate at levels higher than the Coinbase 50 BTC/day limit, and to do it all within the borders.  
I wish CampBX would get their shit together, and upgrade their servers!

Bitcoin has a huge population of people who have a vested interest in its success.  Although the "market cap" (currency base) is in the $1.2 B range, the total investment goes well beyond that:  There are tens of millions of dollars of mining equipment, and tens of millions of dollars of venture capital (soon to be hundreds of millions).  And vendor implementations are huge investments too.
So many smart people with incentive and so many dollars - it will be able to adapt to be a better crypto-currency than anything else that comes along.

Agreed.  It's a bit of a catch-22.  They need to price it high enough to cover their costs.  But costs will drop tremendously once they get some volumes.  And the need for a device like Trezor increases when people are spending more frequently, but the ability to spend more frequently goes up when you have a device like Trezor.
I wanted one, too, and my expected price point was $50 for a first-round device, $20 once there is some volume and competition in this field.  So I'm thinking I'll hold off for now, unless Bitcoins drop to $75, in which case, I'll pick one up, and replace my 1 BTC.

**Short answer: Miners perform an accounting function for the system, and get rewarded for their service, by receiving Bitcoins.**
Long answer:
If you think about electronic currency as a file on your computer that you pass to another person, you can immediately see an issue with this concept: "I can just make a copy of the file, and spend it twice!"
So, generally there needs to be a central clearing house to avoid the "double spend". If you ever got PDF tickets to a concert, you can probably imagine how that works. Someone scans your PDF, and if it's already been scanned by someone else, they won't let you into the concert. There's a central clearing house keeping track of tickets that are already spent.
One of the key features of Bitcoin is that there is no central location or clearing house. It uses Peer-2-Peer technology, rather than central servers. If you remember back to Napster, it was a centralized service (and therefore was easily shut down), whereas sharing services now use P2P, which are hard to shut down (like bittorrent). Bitcoin is like Bittorrent in that respect.
So, the challenge came about: How do you have a central clearing house in a decentralized system? A very tough problem that Bitcoin created an innovative solution for. Basically, the concept of Mining bitcoins came about, as a way to solve the "central clearing house in a decentralized system" problem.
The issues that are being addressed with mining are these:
1) What are the account balances? (How many bitcoins are in each account?)     
2) What is the sequence of transactions? (If someone tries to spend money twice, which one happened first?)
The Bitcoin system was designed very cleverly. Basically, they reward people ("miners") to perform these two functions, thereby solving a couple of other problems:
3) How do you get people to devote resources to the clearing house problem?     
4) How do you fairly distribute all of the bitcoins?
Solution: Pay the accountants in the very currency that they are accounting! Genius! Call them miners, like they are mining gold.
In the early days (2009-2010), you could just run the mining software on your PC. The software would look at recent transactions, and put them together in one list (a "block"), toss one *extra number* into the block, and perform some predefined math on the block. The math spits out an answer, which can be a number anywhere from 1 digit to 86 digits long, when represented in standard decimal. The trick to "confirming transactions" is that some miner needs to determine what *extra number* gets tossed into the block of transactions so that the math creates a "small enough" answer. So really it becomes a race of a search to see who can find the *extra number* that confirms the transactions.
The beauty of this is that finding that *extra number* can be an easy problem or a hard problem, depending on how small you define "small enough". The bitcoin system was designed to automatically adjust that difficulty as more and more miners join in. Imagine this: back in 2009, "small enough" was a challenge to find a number such that the math spit out an answer that was, say less than 80 digits long. Well, there are about nine times as many 2-digit numbers as there are 1-digit numbers. And about nine times as many 3-digit numbers as 2-digit numbers. You can imagine that the answer would come out to be an 86-digit number about 90% of the time, an 85- or 86-digit number about 99% of the time, and an 84-, 85- or 86-digit answer about 99.9% of the time. To get an answer that's less than 80-digits long, you might have to try about a million *extra numbers* before you find it.
Of course, you might get lucky and find it on the first try. Or it might take two million tries. It's random, but on average it might take a million tries. So, back in 2009, you could find that *extra number* that worked, by performing some amount of work on the transactions - say about a million attempts (I'm making this number up, but it was a lot of attempts). And once you found the number, you could tell all the other bitcoin users "here's the number", and they could easily verify your work. Later, as more miners joined in, and the difficulty increased, it took on average about a billion tries to find an *extra number* that worked. Now it takes on average about 300 billion billion tries. So it's extremely unlikely (but possible!) that you, with your little PC, are going to find an *extra number* that pays off, since you can only try a few million tries per second, and it takes 300 billion billion tries on average. But someone will find it, and does, every ten minutes or so.
Once an *extra number* is found that creates a small enough result, those transactions in the block are "confirmed", because it'd be hard for someone to reverse the transactions; they'd have to do the same amount of work on a different transaction set, to un-do those transactions. This is called a "Proof of Work" system, because you can Prove that you did some work by showing the *extra number* that produced a good answer.
Each block also contains information about the previously confirmed block, which is why Bitcoin refers to this as the "Block Chain" - they are linked together. That means that any work spent confirming block  is also considered to be extra work confirming block  in order to un-do block  you'd have to do all the work for block  and block  This means that the more "confirmations" there are, the more work has been done to confirm the transaction, and therefore, the harder it is to un-do the transaction, so the more permanent it is.
In this way, transactions are sequenced, to solve the double-spend issue.
Miners get rewarded by adding a transaction into the block, that puts a certain amount of bitcoins into their account. The amount currently is 25 bitcoins, and it decreases every 4 years or so. A miner couldn't give themselves extra bitcoins, because other people can verify their work and if they did, the verification would fail, and people would just ignore them. (A dollar-example that is parallel to this would be if you took a sharpie and changed the "$1" to "$1000" on a dollar bill. You may convince yourself that you now have $1000, but you won't convince anyone else!)
The difficulty automatically adjusts based on a formula, every 2 weeks, with a target which was intended to have blocks confirmed every 10 minutes or so, and adjusting to the number of computers performing the mining. So, while in 2009 it was very easy to run your PC, and generate (back then) 50 Bitcoins every ten minutes, now there are so many powerful computers performing mining (and being rewarded 25 Bitcoins every 10 minutes), that if you don't have a specialized machine, you won't be successful.
In short, mining is approximately a break-even or losing proposition. People selling the specialized machines can charge a premium, because they are essentially money-printing-presses. You are lucky to break even, when you consider electricity costs, mostly because there are numerous people who perform mining, and many don't do the math to see that you are are lucky to break even.

The math below is nonsensical. Like dividing number of pirates by number of churches or something.


So 14.4M “dollars per year” divided by 8.25M “coins” = $1.74 “dollars per coin-year”. How is a “dollar per coin-year” meaningful as a unit of measure? Why not dollars per coin-month? Why not dollars per coin-hour (since a coin can really be re-circulated within an hour on average).
Other than that, it’s a pretty good article. When trying to figure out what a bitcoin is worth (other than the obvious “the price it’s worth is between what people are willing to pay and what people are willing to sell them for”), you need to look at two things: Utility-value and Speculation-value (or chance-value).
Anybody who says “Bitcoin can’t be used as a currency, because it’s too volatile”, doesn’t understand that it will not always be too volatile. Currently, the vast majority of the value of a bitcoin is in “the chance” that it becomes more useful. As that chance becomes reality (or gets ruled out), “the chance” component of the value becomes less of a factor, and the utility part becomes a greater component of the value.
The “utility-value” increases when more vendors accept Bitcoin, when exchanges can be relied upon more, and when users can more readily understand how to utilize and secure their Bitcoins. The utility as a medium of exchange increases with price stability, but the utility as an investment vehicle decreases as the “chance of a home run investment” becomes realized or ruled out.
Right now, we’re probably 99.9% speculation-value, and 0.1% utility-value. Or it may be more lopsided than that.

Depending on how much time you have, here's a short answer, which expands into a long answer as you continue.  I borrowed this from my answer in another thread:
"Bitcoin is Money over IP". It is a system that allows you to send money to someone without an intermediary (and therefore, with significantly less fees, more privacy, no likelihood of credit-card "chargebacks", and less likelihood of being blocked by the government - think Wikileaks).  With Bitcoin, you can buy stuff, and pay people.
Merchants like it because there are low fees and no chargebacks, which cuts out internet fraud.  This keeps prices down.  It's like being able to offer a "cash discount" to someone over the web, knowing their money won't "bounce".
Everyone I talk to wants to know what Bitcoins are worth, and why. "What gives them value?" The answer to this is that there is a free market trading these things for cash, and currently you can buy or sell a Bitcoin for around $29.30. This fluctuates like any currency does, as some people want to buy and others want to sell the currency. 
Then go into "why the heck is someone willing to pay $29 for what is essentially 'monopoly money'?" And the answer to this is that the currency has some unique properties that no other currency has ever had in the history of mankind. It's decentralized, fixed supply, non-reversible, and mathematically strong (therefore not easy to counterfeit). It can also be transferred or stored extremely inexpensively. No other currency EVER has had these properties.
A lot of people are "betting" that Bitcoins are going to take off, and by owning them now, you are owning something that has a fixed supply, with a potentially high demand, and therefore will rise in value.
Then you can talk about the unique properties, and what they mean - what they mean to the future of governments, what they mean as far as how useful the currency is, etc. Also a good time to get people to think "why do you think that a $20 bill and a $10 bill have value?" (because they are essentially 'monopoly money' too - they only have value because people think they have value - there's no gold backing them, or anything like that. You value the paper because of what you can exchange it for.)
That would be my take on it. People often don't "get" Bitcoin, because the proponents jump in with the anti-government, or the math angle. But the real angle that people get is that you can buy shit, pay someone, etc.
You may also need to address how Bitcoins are created. The Bitcoin system is a "shared ledger", and the miners aren't just "solving a hard math problem". They are the protectors of the ledger. It is the MINERS that prevent double-spending, and it is the shared ledger that ensures that the bitcoins being spent are actually owned by the spender. So the miners get paid for protecting the ledger.
It seems like this is "free money", but really it's expensive to be a miner - it takes a lot of compute power and a lot of electricity. But the integrity of the monetary system depends on them.

Frankly, if someone wants to buy up a bunch of Bitcoins "manipulating" the price upward, I am all for it.
Given that [this address]( still has 111,111 BTC in it, I'd say they aren't manipulating with that.  Anything else is just supply and demand, not "manipulation".

Here's another way to look at it.  At this moment as I type this, the bid/ask is 112.30/112.70 ([chart](  That means that if you sell right now at the market rate, you're going to get $112.30 less commission.  Let's say commission is 0.5%.  So you get $111.7385.
OK, now, let's say you buy back in immediately.  That will cost you $112.70 + commission = $113.2635.
So in order for you to **break even**, the price has to drop about $1.53.  If it goes up, you lose bigger.  If it shoots to $120, you might wait it out, and then watch it go to $125, and then try to re-enter the game.
Also, remember, someone else is betting the opposite of you.
On average, people will be average, and lose about $1.50 per Bitcoin, per churn (at today's rates).

Here's a list of the cycles, with starting date [price] - peak date [price] and ending date [price]:
1. 4/5/11 [$0.58] - 6/8/11 [$32] - 11/17/11 [$2]     
2. 11/17/11 [$2] - 1/8/12 [$7.2] - 5/29/12 [$5.02]     
3. 5/29/12 [$5.02] - 8/16/12 [$13.85] - 2/2/13 [$13.17]     
4.  2/2/13 [$13.17] - 4/10/13 [$266] - ending date TBD.
The cycle lengths were as follows:
1. 64 days from start to peak, 162 days from peak to end.       
2.  52 days from start to peak, 142 days from peak to end.     
3.  79 days from start to peak, 170 days from peak to end.
4.  67 days from start to peak, the fall is TBD.
Looks like the longer the climb, the longer the fall.
So if you assume that the same pattern will be followed, the fall should end around 67 days after the peak April 10, so approximately 9/22/2013.  Using my earlier method, that would predict a low point at $48.48 on 9/22.  Then another climb for somewhere between 52 and 79 days (say 65 days), probably peaking out around 11/26 at about 3x the low ($145), before beginning another 5 month descent.
**TL; DR: Final Trollcast:  the price falls to $48.48 on 9/22/13.  Then it begins climbing, and climbs to $145+ on 11/26/13.  Between 11/26/13 and 5/8/2014, it works its way to a "bottom" at $152, before its next climb.**

Still not convinced that all the debate over deflationary currency is worth while, given that it's never been strictly deflationary, and it's very possible that it never is strictly deflationary.

I am not an advocate for physical bitcoins, so don't get me wrong...   But your statement is a bit of an exaggeration.  
You can validate that a private key works out to a specific Bitcoin Address in an offline fashion, without redeeming it.  And you can check the balance of that Bitcoin Address.  (Steps which, admittedly, are not very convenient.)
Still, you are right in that you cannot guarantee the security of this private key.
There are convenience advantages which are tradeoffs to security.  At the $1 and $5 level, such convenience might be worth the risk.
I don't use them, though.

When you buy on Mt. Gox, they will automatically store the Bitcoin in your Mt Gox account.  You can leave it there, at your risk.  Or you can transfer it to yourself.
If you are looking to buy and hold, I strongly recommend that you go to  and follow the instructions on the screen.  Simply move your mouse a little bit.  In about ten seconds, you will be given a public key and a private key.   (You can press the Generate New Address button a few times.)  Then print it out, and store it in 2 or more places.  Use the public key to transfer money OUT of Mt Gox, and onto the piece of paper that you just created.  Then you are done.
So, in summary...   1) get the money to Mt Gox.  In the USA here, I do this via Dwolla.  Establish an accuont at Dwolla.com, and hook it to your bank account, and transfer money from the bank to Dwolla.  This will take you about a week.  Meanwhile, sign up for Mt Gox and prove your identity.  That too will take a week.
2)  Move the money from Dwolla to Mt Gox.  This might cost you a quarter.  Instructions are on the Mt Gox site.  
3)  Buy Bitcoin on Mt Gox.  This will cost you 0.6% over market.
4)  Go to bitaddress.org and generate a paper wallet.  Do this from a secure PC, preferably from a private browser window.  If you are super paranoid, you can disconnect from the internet once the webpage loads, and reboot the machine after you print your paper wallet.
5) Transfer money from Mt Gox to the paper wallet using the PUBLIC key.
6) Look on btcbal.com or blockchain to see your balance.
If you ever want to redeem the Bitcoins, Mt Gox and Blockchain.info and others offer the capability of importing the Private Key.
If you ever want to add more money to the same paper wallet, simply use the same public key.
Edit:  Blockchain.info, not .com

An easy way for sophisticated investors to take money from less-sophisticated investors is to take advantage of emotion and panic mentality.
If you have your sights set on 3-5 years down the road, and are in for the long haul, then even a 30% correction right now is no big deal.  Actually it's a huge buying opportunity.
I don't claim to be a real sophisticated investor myself, but I do try to separate MY emotion from investment decisions (although I try to recognize others' and use it to my advantage).
I watch this weekend's drop, and get out of the way.  I don't sell into it.  I am generally buying, so I may suspend buying temporarily and let it fall.  If enough "buyers" do that, it will continue to fall for a bit, and some less sophisticated investors will sell, and it may fall more, encouraging others to sell.  Then I buy.
I'm in "accumulate mode", so I'm not selling anytime soon.  But I welcome a shakeout every now and then.  A little panic never hurts.

@_date: 2013-08-01 13:30:00
Pretty interesting idea. If I understand correctly, mode 2 would actually "close out bitcoin addresses" with every spend, which would really help in the effort to reduce all the dust accounts out there.  On the other hand, it would tend to make transactions larger (byte-count), often unnecessarily.
I like the thinking though.  Let me toss out a couple of other ideas:
I think a cool client feature (maybe this is in there and I don't know it) would be to choose the Input addresses based on Taint.  Call it "Privacy Mode = High" or something.   I suspect that the current mode of most clients is to choose the Inputs for a transaction based on either the best fit for the transaction amount, or based on the age of the last transaction in that Bitcoin Address. 
What I am advocating in "Privacy Mode = High" would be that the client should resist linking two Bitcoin Addresses together that haven't been linked in the past.  In other words, try not to taint.
Example:  Say Dave has 3 bitcoin addresses that have funds in them.  2 were change from his SilkRoad transactions with his favorite dealer, and a third one is funds from Mt Gox.  If a transaction is going to require 2 of the 3 Inputs, I would prefer it link the two Silkroad transactions together (if they already are linked due to previous transactions), rather than the Gox transaction + an SR transaction.  
So "taint analysis" would be part of the Bitcoin Client function.  Not sure how practical, but it's just an idea.
I had another idea about Light Clients.  This is probably somewhat underway already, with Merkle Trees, and such.  But it just dawned on me today.
Traditionally, I think of my "proof" that I own some bitcoins being that I have access to the private address of an address that has Bitcoins in the ledger.  So proof = Private Key + Entire Ledger.
But today, I thought of something different.  My proof is that private key, plus each block that funds the bitcoin address, plus all blocks after that funding (to prove it wasn't spent), plus a Merkle Tree of the ledger.
Right now, if I want to send you bitcoins, I broadcast a transaction, proving I have the private key, and assuming you have the ledger.
But my new thought is that if I assume you have the Merkle Tree of the ledger, my point-to-point transaction could really be the transaction, plus the blocks that prove I own the address (and haven't spent it).  In other words, you could be walking around with a cell phone with JUST the Merkle Tree on it, and I could "point-to-point" (near-field communication, or blue tooth) transmit to you all the information you would need to accept my money.  it'd be a longer transaction (because it would include a bunch of blocks - whatever you need that you don't have), but the tradeoff is "bigger data transfer, POINT-TO-POINT, at the time of a transaction, for no need for either of us to store the entire block chain."
I might not necessarily broadcast the transaction (you could), but instead, I could send DIRECTLY to you all the information that you would need to prove that it's a valid transaction.  Point-to-point, not broadcast style.
....sorry, that just dawned on me this morning.  Probably something you have thought about already.

I think the downvotes are probably because you make some very valid points and then end it with one case as "proof":  "See, I made money and that proves it" (which sounds arrogant and condescending).  Gamblers can always cite instances when they were right, and often conveniently forget the cases when they were wrong - not accusing you of that, but it's a common pattern among people with gambling problems.
In reality, you can choose a case for many "means" depending on the period you choose.  For example, looking at the [period since 4/1]( the mean is more like $115 or $120.

There's days destroyed, as a measure of circulation.
The concept is that every day, bitcoins in storage are held for one day more.  So you can look at bitcoins that have changed hands today, and tell how old they were, to make an assessment of how many days of destruction took place.
It's more of a measure of the circulation of coins, not of how many were lost, though.

I was involved in an ecash project in the '90s.  Many of the basic technologies of Bitcoin were well known at that time.  The concept of using a P2P ledger wasn't really talked about.  
This NSA doc was really nothing more than the exact ideas that were being floated around at the time.  Several research papers and a few magazine articles are in my files that are very similar and from the same era.
Proof of work was a known concept, as of [Hashcash]( in '97 (for spam filtering).  
Bitcoin brought Blockchain, proof of work, and P2P together (along with a bunch of other technologies built into the protocol that haven't yet been exploited, thanks to the scripting language built into the protocol.)

Looks great from what I've watched so far.
At about 2:50 in the video, you say that the Public Key and the Bitcoin Address are the same thing, and that people send money to the Public Key.  This is inaccurate and misleading at a technical level, but is OK for a high-level presentation.
The relationship is this:
From the Private key you can generate a Public Key, and from a Public Key you can generate a bitcoin address.
The public key isn't used much by users (so it gets glossed over a lot), but it is used by the software.  The public key is much longer than the bitcoin address.  The bitcoin address is derived from the public key (it contains a hash of the public key), but also contains a checksum, and is represented in ~~base-59~~ base-58. 
Look at  and see the various items (Private Key, Public Key, and Bitcoin Address), and note the various lengths and formats.  I believe in binary form the Public Key and Private Key are the same length, but on brainwallet.org, the private key is represented as a ~~base-59~~ base-58 (with checksum?), while the public key is in hex.
But the public key is most definitely not the same as the Bitcoin Address, as you say in the video.  The Bitcoin Address is much shorter and protected with checksum.  The Public Key is only revealed when you SPEND money, not when you have someone send to you.
See [this technical document]( for how a Bitcoin Address is derived from the Public Key.
(Note, I am not knocking the video - to some degree, this is nit-picking for an intro video.  But for someone trying to really understand, this inaccuracy can be frustrating.  I struggled with this when I was trying to learn about Bitcoin, because so many sources say the same thing that you do in the video!)

I believe one of the drivers is the amount of currency in circulation that is necessary to conduct business.
Picture a business ten years from now.  Say they want to conduct business in Bitcoins, on both ends of the transaction.  They buy stuff from their supplier in Bitcoins, and they sell stuff to their customers in Bitcoins.
In the perfect world, a profitable business like this needs no bitcoins on hand.  They spend the coins after they receive them.  But the world isn't perfect.  There's a business issue called "cash flow".  And you'll have different needs for cash at different times of the month, depending on your business cycle.  So a business like this will need to HOLD enough coins to conduct business on a monthly basis, to cover the fluctuations of their monthly business cycle.
So if every business has to "hold" a little, and say "a little" is defined as $10,000 worth, on average.  And say there are one million of these businesses.  How many dollars worth of Bitcoin currency needs to be in existence?  Answer:  10K x 1M = $10B.
So if the "market cap" of the currency is $10B, and there are only 21M coins in existence, every Bitcoin is worth....?   $476.
---  
But wait, there's more... what if 100M consumers also want to hold pocket change of say $100.  oh, there's another $10B in valuation, so now each Bitcoin is worth $952.
As an owner of a small business (10 employees), I can tell you my monthly business cycle fluctuates my cash balance by about $60K (i.e. six times higher than my simple example).
Bottom line, the numbers are staggering if this catches on.

OK, you are talking about affecting the exchange rate.  I understand that getting too high of a percentage will affect the exchange rate.  I'm not sure that going from 10% to 18% would affect the exchange rate.  
In fact, going from 10 to 18% could POSITIVELY affect the exchange rate if you are not the market share leader, as you would presumably be reducing someone else's share.
My question was, would it ever make sense to pay for 41M MHash/s, and leave half, 21.5M MHash/s, sitting there unplugged?
Say the ASIC price (based on Avalon, 4 module) is 100 BTC for 85 GH/s, then to acquire 18%, needing 41M MH/s (or 41K GH/s), you'd need to buy 41K/85 Avalon's (482 units) to achieve 18%.  So for 48.2K BTC (roughly $5M), you can own 18%.  (Ignoring the fact that ASICs are impossible to get, did I get that Math right?)
Back to my question.  If you shelled out $5M for ASICs, would it make financial sense to leave $2.5M of them unplugged?  Would you make that up somehow through lower difficulty?  I just don't get that.

The issue is that you are trying to buy non-refundable money with refundable sources.  Thieves buy bitcoin, and then "bounce the check", but get to keep the bitcoins.  As a protection mechanism, time and verification is inserted into the process.
The good news is that once you have overcome the entry hurdle, it's pretty much smooth sailing.
This also means that a certain amount of people have probably "given up because it's too hard".  Meaning that as it gets easier, the demand will likely go up.

There will be a Bitcoin address (starts with a 1) on the left, along with the QR code.  That's the load and verify.
There will be a Private Key (starts with a 5) on the right, along with a QR code.  you want to protect that!!!
to spend, you need to import the private key into a program, such as Bitcoin-QT or Blockchain.info.  I have done it many times on Blockchain.info.   Each time I do it, I "FULLY SPEND" the wallet.  That means if I want to pay someone 10 Bitcoins, pay the balance to myself at a new paper wallet address.  Then dispose of the old paper wallet with the now-zero balance.  (others have lost coins by "spending" part, and the "change" ends up somewhere unexpected - not in the paper wallet, which is why I always fully spend the paper wallet.)
it's easy to test this procedure with small amounts.

First, there's no certainty that "they are going to try to be clever about BTC", since he asked what it was, when a Bitcoiner asked him when they'd do an episode.  So it's far from a done deal!
Second, the key to the comedy of the show is to exaggerate some very real traits about certain geeks (read his responses in the AMA!)
Third, I think BBT portrays geeks in much the same way as Grey's Anatomy portrays doctors - that is, they take a few real bits, and make it interesting for a general audience.
Personally, I think it'd be a good thing for Bitcoin to get mentioned (even with a negative spin) in a mainstream show.

This would make a lot more sense if it was done on the log graph. 
But then it wouldn't nearly match the June 2011 spike.  It looks more like January 2012 spike (see  ). 
From November 2011 to January 2012, it went from about 2 to 7.5, and then pulled back to about 4.  See  .
This would match the recent run from 13 to 48.75, and then a pull back to 26.
Personally, I don't think we'll ever see the 20's again, but I hope we do!
(Isn't there a big wall at 48.75???  Hmm......)

They claim that Bitcoin miners need to register, according to FinCEN.  That is NOT how I read the FinCEN regs.
Miners who are part of a pool are being paid for the service of the bookkeeping function.  So it's just income.  They are not "creating more virtual currency" which is what requires registration.
If you are part of a mining pool, you are just providing compute time in exchange for a trickle of payments.  Your computer may or may not be the one that "creates more virtual currency" (most probably not!)

I almost hate to point this out...    
But the path from a Bank in the US to Dwolla to Mt. Gox has proven to be the most cost-effective for me.   Dirt cheap (near zero!).  Then when you buy on Mt Gox, it's 0.6% or less.
Granted, when the price of Bitcoins are rising 10% per week, waiting a week for the money to clear Dwolla is not really a savings.  CoinBase is such a better option when it's working smoothly.  The 1% fee to "BUY NOW" is well worth it.
My experience with BitInstant to Bitcoins ended up being about 6% (buying $400 worth of Bitcoins), even though the advertised price was much less.  Not sure what spot price they were using, but clearly when I made the purchase, I could see the 15-minute window on Mt Gox, and it was not as advertised.
On the other hand, BitInstant's instant service was awesome, and with Bitcoin on the rise, there's something to be said for coin in hand!
Edit:  For people who are new, Dwolla has a bad name in the "Bitcoin community" for allegedly stiffing Tradehill and causing them to go out of business.  So usually Dwolla is a bad word.  Bitcoin led to their rapid rise, and then they did that!

As a person who prefers Bitcoin, Bitcoin is a replacement for fiat.  Anybody who owes me anything can send it to me in Bitcoin.  And for that matter, I'll pay the same way, if the person I owe prefers Bitcoin.
Maybe we need an "I prefer Bitcoin" campaign.  Hot chicks with skimpy T-shirts with the slogan.  Bumper Stickers.  Web Buttons.  etc.
@_date: 2013-04-26 16:30:29
I think the challenge is that you need trusted agents that you can send your fiat money to, or receive your money from.  Certainly trading between virtual currencies could be done this way.  It'd be a little tricky, because you and I may decide to exchange 1 BTC for 50 LTC (or whatever), but somehow we'd need to perform the exchange  - you send first, and then I'll send back.
Escrow solves that issue.  And believe it or not, contracts built into the Bitcoin protocol could solve that issue (although it's a feature that isn't used very much).
But let's say you and I meet on a P2P exchange and decide to exchange 1 BTC for $135.  The BTC can be exchanged, but how does the fiat get exchanged?  
I think Ripple is being designed to address this challenge.
@_date: 2013-02-22 11:05:51
This is meant purely as an analogy, and I'm not trying to permanently link Ripple to the illegal drug trade, but that's how I picture this working.
Imagine a Colombian drug lord producing massive amounts of drugs, and distributing them to his ten top dogs in the distribution channel.  In the past, there would be money changing hands, but in this case it's just an IOU.  And then the top dogs distribute them down their channel to the next 100 in the distribution channel.  Again, IOUs are given in exchange.  Eventually, the end "user" gets the drugs, and gives IOUs for the drugs.
At this point, each intermediary has received at least as many IOUs as they have given.  The two end points are the ones who are out of whack - the drug lord has IOUs and has no drugs, while the (many) users have drugs and have written IOUs.
Now, if the drug lord can transfer these IOUs to others (like pay the workers in the field, buy bullet-proof Cadillacs, buy guns, etc.) then the IOUs can just be passed around more and more.  No one needs cash.
The only downside is that this system is all based on the credit-worthiness of a DRUG USER (i.e. the collective credit-worthiness of the lowest people in the chain).  Basically, the system depends on the financial wisdom of the masses.
In theory it sounds real good.  And it could work MOST of the time.  But, just like the CDOs of the recent financial/housing crisis, it's not a stable model in tough times.  
Reminder of CDO mess-ups:  Investors trusted big banks with their money, for mortgage-backed securities.  Big banks diversified their risks by splitting up the mortgages into tranches (collections with various risks and characteristics), and counting on a lot of little 3rd parties.  The 3rd parties were little companies in the Cayman Islands and elsewhere.  Some shell companies solely for holding these tranches.
When things were good, they were very good.  But it was all dependent on the credit-worthiness and smarts of the masses: the home owner and the many little tiny shell companies.  Once that proved to be bad, it got very bad, very fast.
The IOUs became worthless, and big banks fell.  Probably not enough big banks fell, but some did.  And then came the bailout.
No one will be there to bail out Ripple when the fall comes.  But it'll be a GREAT system until then.
PS Ripple is a GREAT name to describe how the system will fail.  Disaster will Ripple through this system so fast!

Very accurate description!   These regulations are passed off as consumer protection laws, but are actually put in place by lawmakers who are lobbied by the existing financial cartel.
Every time I see my brother, a small bank VP, he says I'm going to go to jail for merely buying and selling Bitcoin.  The mentality that "you must be doing something illegal if you are making money with money" within the banking community (simply by buying and selling something that sounds like money) astounds me.  
They are brainwashed that somehow these crappy barriers are good for consumers.

If someone guesses my password and uses it to access my private files on some computer (like gmail), then I believe that should be (and is) illegal.
If someone guesses my pass phrase and uses their own computer to generate a private key, and uses that to spend my bitcoins, then I don't believe "illegal access" has been committed, and therefore I'm not sure that's a prosecutable crime. 
So, to answer your question, my PERSONAL belief is that it's possible to "get robbed" and not have it be a crime.  If the password is "guessed" (and not "key logged"), and my system and files weren't used, but my money was claimed.
I don't know. It's murky territory.  If I'm dumb enough to hide my money in a predictable pass phrase, then I've essentially made my money "public domain".

There will be at least a 3-day waiting period for your funds to clear.  With Monday being a bank holiday, it would probably be Thursday if you executed the transaction now.
The challenge is that you are trying to convert reversible money into irreversible money.  And so they need to wait to make sure your transfer doesn't bounce.  With Bitinstant.com, you are handing over CASH or DEBIT CARD (which are also irreversible money), so it happens faster.
On the plus side, Coinbase will give you today's price, and let you buy 10 bitcoins immediately.  But they won't give you access to them until the transfer clears.

But there are solutions to this issue (Green wallets, for one).
I'm not going to argue that bitcoin is perfect, but it does solve a specific market niche.  And the 1-hour/ 6 confirmation thing, when compared to ANYTHING else, stacks up pretty darn good.
Compared to a 90-day wait time to make sure a transfer is irrefuted (for credit cards, paypal, etc), Bitcoin kicks it's ass.
Compared to a 3-day wait time for checks or ACH to clear, an hour stacks up pretty well.  (And checks can be disputed later.)
Compared to someone handing me a stack of twenties or hundred dollar bills, and me having to check them to make sure they aren't counterfeit - well, since I'm no expert in counterfeit money, I'm liking Bitcoin.  (I actually had someone try to buy a car from me for all hundred dollar bills.  I insisted we take them to a bank and convert it to a bank check.)  -- not to mention the difficulty of handing someone cash over the internet.
Not perfect, but offers something pretty good.

Am I the only one who uses Blockchain's awesome wallet feature as a disposable wallet?
Hold a lot of money on paper wallets?  Open a blockchain.info wallet and be able to "watch" your fortune, even if it's in ten different paper wallets.
Want to convert one of your paper wallets to online bitcoin?  create a throw-away wallet on blockchain.info, import the private key, and pay whomever you want.  Pay the balance to a new paper wallet and burn the old paper wallet.
My favorite trick:  Want to show off your riches?  [log into Blockchain.info]( with the user "imrich" and the password "imrichimrichimrich" and have a multi-million dollar bitcoin balance.  (OK no one be a dick and delete the watched accounts!)

[There's a page]( of double spends... they aren't all that rare.  It means that someone attempted to spend the money twice, possibly accidentally, possibly as a fraud attempt.
Since you mentioned satoshidice:  They process zero-confirmation transactions, and it's been discussed that this has a risk.  The documented risk (as I understand it) is that it's possible for someone to place a bet, and then if it's a losing bet, spend the money elsewhere with a large fee.  The 2nd spend gets processed, and the bet would get discarded.  Well, I suppose maybe satoshi might have paid you with some of that bad money.
I suspect that doublespends get cleared up within an hour or so, but maybe not how you want it to!  That doubly-spent money could vanish from you.

You really need to try to forget the concept of "coins" and think of it more as an "account balance" in a giant, shared ledger.
So, if your computer is off, but someone sends you Bitcoins, they are really just increasing your account balance on the ledger, and decreasing their own.
Then when you power up, and you synchronize with the ledger, you can see your coins.

I find it MUCH easier and less costly to secure my Bitcoins than to secure cash (bills and coins) or metals.  In fact, every method that works with bills and coins works with paper wallets:  a safe, a mattress, etc.  
But Bitcoin also allows new methods of storage:  A brain wallet, shared secrets, and multiple locations.  And they are all pretty darn cheap to me (generally, the cost is learning, not storage).
I agree, the "average" person needs to depend on intermediaries (like Coinbase) to securely store their bitcoins.  But the difference is that with traditional money systems, people became "above average" by having wealth.  With Bitcoin, you can become "above average" by having intelligence or doing a little research.  At that point, you can be your own bank.
Regarding thugs or governments confiscating your wealth, they can do that with almost any kind of wealth - coins, bank accounts, gold, etc.  But they can't do that with a brain wallet.  
So yeah, it's different.  Not saying it's perfect, but I am specifically answering your question "how's that any different?"
P.S.  I would like to see your "one documented case of that already happening", because every news article about that case that I saw (if we are talking about the same case) danced around the topic of actually "confiscating" bitcoins - they eluded to it, but I don't believe that has actually happened.  But I may be misinformed.

well, I think it would be relatively simple to modify code AND get it accepted into the main branch.  Since 100 people have already done that, I believe that is evidence.
However, since that's not the question you asked, I'll tell you ways to do what you ask:
Modify the underlying code.  A contributor to the C compiler, to the QT library (for the main client), or any library used in the software (the database library, the encryption library, hell.. look at the list of incorporated libraries and pick one), could make modifications that introduce bugs.  In addition, any piece of platform that is utilized (library software, operating system, microcode, or hardware) - every one of those can be modified to introduce a bug.  And I doubt that the Bitcoin developers have their eyes on that code.
This is a topic discussed in security circles all the time (see Schneier), but it becomes very interesting when real money is at stake.
Don't get me wrong, I love Bitcoin, and feel that steps can be (and are) being taken to address some of this.  But I just think people shouldn't be blind and naive to the potential security issues.

I'm not an accountant, but I would say yes.  Your losses would offset your gains, just like any other investment losses.  And then if the net is a loss (after offsetting gains), there's a limit to how many losses you can take in a year, and then you carry the balance of losses forward to future years.
I would compare it to currency investing, and follow the same pattern as if you bought a foreign currency.
@_date: 2013-03-01 08:56:16
I would argue that every transaction has a buyer and a seller, and the whole argument that "The buyer won't want to part with their currency that is rising in value" is 100% completely and absolutely offset by the same emotion on the seller side.  
If you're only going to argue one side of the argument, you may as well say "Deflationary currency won't work, because sellers will want the coin so much more than the goods that they have, that they will do anything to get it - they will offer an infinite amount of goods to get that currency".
The facts are that the currency has a "value" as determined by the market, given all known information.  If it were 100% absolutely guaranteed to be worth more tomorrow, it'd basically be worth that today.

OK so then we come down to the definition of ridiculous.  Hopefully that will be a different number for each of us, or there will be a major crash.
A better way to look at this is to devote a certain portion of your net worth to Bitcoin.  Anything above that, sell.  So, maybe 10% of your net worth.  Maybe 50%, if you have balls of steel.  
Whatever number - you choose.   That way, you'll have a rational liquidation program, and you won't be tempted to sell when you see a major pullback (which is inevitable with the sort of run-up we've had).

There's a "spreadsheet" at the bottom of [this page]( that shows the price to buy or sell at various quantities.
The volume column tells you how many BTCs are bid or asked, and in parentheses how many orders this pertains to.  And then the BTC and USD columns report the cumulative amounts, so you can quickly see how much it would cost you to buy or sell 100 BTC.
For example, I see this on the Bid side:    
104.02 	95 (5) 	169 	17575 	
and this on the ask side:      
105.42 	54 (3) 	132 	13896 	
So I can see that selling 169 BTC would get me $17,575 (or about 103.99 each (excluding commission), thanks to the Bids on the books.
And buying 132 BTC would cost me $13,896 (or about 105.27 each).  
So the spread between bid and ask, at 130 BTC is from 103.99 to 105.27.  (The spread as I type this, at 1 BTC is 104.86 to 104.87.)
So as you can see, as the quantity gets greater, the spread gets greater.

It's all Javascript, one HTML file (view source, and you'll see), and you are welcome to use it elsewhere.

Why the heck would you buy 2 shares if you think it's a con?
There are so many better ways to "waste" money on a long shot.  What could possibly come out of this?  Could you maybe multiply your money by 10?  Why not go over to  and put it on a 10:1 long shot and be done with it.  At least you have a good shot of honesty there.
Or if you want to waste a few fractions of a bitcoin, send it to and feed a homeless person.  You may not 10x your investment, but I would rather support a good cause than feed a greedy con-artist.

I don't mean to pry, but I am curious as to the consensus opinion as to **what is "a lot of bitcoins"?**
Looks like you need 2981 BTC to be in the [top 410 individual Bitcoin Addresses]( Those addresses hold ~30% of the bitcoins.
So, I guess "a lot" is probably over 1000?

Left (orange) = standing buy orders, right (blue) = standing sell orders at the current moment (the moment the graph was generated).
The jagged line down the middle (green) reflects the price of bitcoins that actually changed hands.
The WALL that everyone refers to can be seen in this image - it's the lower left part of the blue line - a vertical line segment at $30.  Usually, the blue line will ramp up and to the right in a similar fashion as the orange line is ramping up and to the left - a gentle slope with a little bit of jaggedness.  But since so many people had Sell orders asking for $30 (or it could technically have been one person selling a ton of Bitcoins), the blue line isn't a gentle slope, it's a wall at $30.  
The wall remains, until it gets chipped away by people willing to pay $30.  (All the standing Buy orders, represented in orange, are for less - otherwise they'd be executed transactions and not standing orders.)
Note that the walls happen on both the buy side and the sell side.  Usually they occur at even amounts, like $30, because people are more likely to say "sell at 30.00" than any other single particular number (like "sell at 30.23")

I'm glad someone said it!
The fact of the matter is that NO currency is stable relative to the Bitcoin.  Not one.  So people can whine about the dollar not being stable.
The reason it doesn't make sense to do that is that many/most items are priced in dollars.  Once Bitcoin is the predominant exchange medium, it will  be stable, and if it's not, then people will be complaining about "the other currency" not being stable, not bitcoin.  
I have every confidence that Bitcoin will get there.  But it's a matter of Bitcoin catching on, not Bitcoin becoming stable.

Are you sure that's how DNS works?  :)
There's no "propagation to all DNS servers" of the billions of domain names.  Rather, there's a cache on each DNS servers (and also on your local machine) that stores the domain name to IP address resolution of sites looked up, for possibly as long as the TTL (Time To Live) value.
So, in other words, you were looking at a cached value, which means that you, or someone, retrieved the splash-page DNS entry recently.  The TTL time period of the splash-page entry would need to expire (or the DNS server could run out of cache space), for the cached value to no longer be there.
That's a VERY common misconception of DNS, though, that there's some sort of propagation.

I "watched" the first one.  Good introduction.  I'll give you feedback since you asked, but overall, I'd say that it's good as is.  No need to re-do it on account of my feedback!  Still, maybe you can use this feedback to improve future videos.
1.  I think you should use the video portion to reinforce your points.  No sense in having video if you are just going to show the same slide through the whole video  (apologies if you had something in the video; all I saw was the same slide the whole time.)
2.  You could "jump right in" a little quicker.  I think that it took about 45 seconds to start - since you started with an apology and other introductory stuff.  I think the YouTube generation has an attention span of about 10 seconds before they decide whether they are going to watch or click on.  I think you may want to start with a bold statement in the first ten seconds, and then use the rest of the video to support the bold statement.  For instance "Bitcoin is the first time in human history where you can send value directly to nearly anyone nearly instantly and nearly for free."  or something bold.
3.  I would put the apology for hard-to-understand English on the video, and not waste time in the audio saying that.  Your English is very good, and very understandable to me, an American.  (We invented poor English!)
4.  The only words that I found hard to understand (well, not really hard to understand, but just pronounced in a non-standard way, where standard = "how I talk")....  "PayPal" sounded like "Pay Paul".  For me, I rhyme it with "Al" or "gal", not "All" or "gull".  "Guaranty" sounded like "gerenty".  I'd pronounce the first syllable more like "Gary" than "tiger".  And "Revolutionized", I pronounce a short "e" in "rev".  You said "reev".  Still, none of those things distract too much; I'm just giving you feedback since you asked.  Overall, your English is VERY understandable.
5.  You talk about "no one being able to take your money away" (implying governments, etc.), but don't understate the risks of a) thieves taking your money, b) websites going out of business with your money (think InstaWallet, and many exchanges), c) currency fluctuation risks (if you put $1000 into Bitcoins, there is no guaranty that you can get $1000 out).
I'll take a look at  and  but overall,  I really liked  
Hope that helps!

Maybe 5 days earlier, his supervisor said "just tell them 2 weeks".
I used to get questions from customers about when certain software features would release.  I'd get a timeframe from the development team, and then double it when I told the customer.  
If a customer asked me on January 2, and the developers said "should be done by the end of February", I'd tell the customer 16 weeks (based on the 8 week estimate).  Then if another customer asked me in February, I'd say "based on what I heard last time I checked into it, I'd estimate it's 16 weeks out..." (effectively moving the expected deadline).

The 1% or .1% don't require intermediaries (I took a leap, and interpreted that you meant that the 1% were "above" average, not below).  In traditional banking, you have to have a lot of money to do that.  With Bitcoin, you have to have some knowledge.

This is contrary to the FinCEN guidance already provided (unless he is referring to SOLO mining).
The FinCEN guidance said that if you provide goods and services for Bitcoin, you need not register, but the person who "creates" virtual currency needs to register.
You can trace back the "creator" of the virtual currency - it's the person who owns the private keys to the Coinbase Transaction in the Block - also known as the mining pool operator.  
The Pool Operator is paying (in separate, already created virtual currency) pool workers, who provide a service of hashing.  But the hashing doesn't create the coins.  The hashing provides a transaction THAT THE POOL OPERATOR can distribute, which creates the coin (WHICH BECOME OWNED BY THE POOL OPERATOR).  
The pool operator pays for that processing power.

@_date: 2013-07-16 11:22:25
well... *technically,* neither is correct.  (whoa, don't push that down arrow yet!  Stay with me here!)
Here's the history behind those dates:  [The curve of the planned distribution]( approaches 100% rapidly at first, and by 2040, nearly all coins are distributed.  But partial coins would be distributed until 2140, by the plan, until the block reward would slip below the precision of the current implementation.  
In other words, if you cut the (initial) 50 BTC block reward in half enough times, by 2140 it becomes less than 1 satoshi.
But that was just the plan.  Reality will most certainly play out differently for several reasons.  One is that the blocks are being discovered about every 7 minutes now, instead of every 10 minutes.  [It's been reported]( that the miners are 15 to 55 years ahead of schedule.
The second reason is that [the code says]( that the block reward goes on forever (but just keeps getting smaller every 210000 blocks), but it's just a precision issue that is causing the distribution of coins to end.  And [there is already consideration that it's possible to extend this precision](


This means that it's possible for the precision to be extended, and for block rewards to continue far beyond the current plan.  Note that this doesn't ever allow more than 21 Million bitcoins due to mathematical "limits" - you just get closer and closer to 21 Million.
@_date: 2013-05-03 16:51:23
I think your assumption there is incorrect.  Bitcoin Addresses are able to be validated without looking at the Blockchain.  If they are of the correct format, and the checksum checks out, then it should be fine.
Sounds like maybe you had a bug.  You might try taking a known valid Bitcoin Address, converting it to binary, stripping off the checksum (trailing 4 bytes, I believe) and the leading "1" (zero), and converting it back to base-58 to see what you have... and then think of that as your "vanity portion" and try to create a Bitcoin Address out of it using your code.  You should come up with the exact Bitcoin Address that you started with.

I think the trick is knowing which 24.  And, if I understand 's comment, he's saying that typical brute force programs treat the character sets in groups.




Since it contains lower case and spaces, you have 26 lower case, plus 19 special characters (not sure which ones he's referring to).




I'm guessing with upper, lower, hyphen, comma, and space, you pick up some other "sets".  But I can't figure out how he's adding up to 86.  The original 45, plus 26 uppers, plus 15 other special characters, I presume.

I agree with others.  Mentally prepare yourself to lose every penny / milliEuro or whatever they are called.
If you DO decide to do it, start figuring out how the heck you are going to execute the plan.  You may find, like others, that it is very difficult to get significant cash into Bitcoins rapidly.  So start the process ASAP.  Time is ticking....
I'd still say only put in what you are willing to lose - don't put in 100%.  How about max at 50% or 60%, which is REALLY aggressive.  And then, as quickly as you see gains, pull your original investment out, so you aren't kicking yourself later for being reckless.

Can you help me understand Ripple?
I understand it to be a trust network, where money doesn't need to change hands immediately between two parties who trust each other.  Instead, an IOU is created (which may be resolved later with a counter-IOU or a money transfer).  Is that anywhere close to being correct?
What bothers me about this is that you although you can control who you trust, you can't necessarily control who they trust.  It brings back bad memories of the sub-prime lending fiasco, where tranches of mortgages were bundled up as CDOs and "insured" as a group by tiny companies who folded up when their investment went bad.  I trusted a giant bank with my funds, and the giant bank trusted a bunch of untrustworthy tiny companies in the Cayman Islands with these toxic assets.  (see [this link](

Extrapolating that, straightline, it puts the next block adjustment in 1057 days, or 6/24/2016.  But the rate is actually accelerating, so it'll likely be sooner than that.

Would you feel better if the original selling proposition website said "as part of our manufacture testing process, we will burn-in test your unit for 1 day.  You get to keep the bitcoins generated." and then they raised the price by one day's worth of bitcoins?  Seems a little silly to pay and then get the money back.
If I were running the operation, I would work to get units tested and out the door as quickly as possible, but I see a lot of efficiencies can be gained by doing things in batches.  
1.  Produce chips for entire batch     
2.  Assemble units in small groups or for the entire batch      
3.  Configure units  (definitely efficiencies here by doing it in batches rather than 1 at a time!)    
4.  Burn-test units **in real life scenario** (which means live network, not testnet)    
5.  Pull some units off test-bed     
6.  Pack these units      
7.  Ship these units      
repeat steps 5-7 until you get through the whole batch.
In this case, you are going to accumulate some bitcoins.  This in no way should diminish the amount of processing work that that the buyer's machine can perform, assuming that testing is a good idea, and that your customers would rather receive tested units than potentially bad units.
Incidentally, when early shipments from Batch 2 started showing failures in the field (due to the fuse issue that was mentioned elsewhere), I, as hypothetical production manager, would probably want to devote resources to troubleshoot that problem, potentially slowing down the shipping process (steps 5-7).  No sense in shipping out a bunch of defective units.  And if I did that, then the units on the test-bed would generate more bitcoins.
The production problems have been discussed all over the forums, and I think it's ridiculous to start a witch-hunt over this.  There is so much whining by greedy buyers that I have to assume that most are unsophisticated, probably young buyers.  The fact of the matter is that when you buy ANY technology for business, where you expect an ROI, if the product gets delayed, your ROI may get delayed or eliminated.  Welcome to the world of IT purchasing that has gone on since 1950.

No one knows for sure.  Certainly not me.
My feeling is that it will definitely rise again like in April.  Or more specifically, like January 1 to April 9.  What I can't tell you is whether that rise will be from 80 to 1000, or whether it will first drop to 8, and then rise to 200.
I'd also say that it's highly likely that you will be able to buy them cheaper before October 1 (an arbitrary date) than you can buy them now.  But that sometime before July of next year, the current price will look dirt cheap.
So if you invest now and hold for a couple of years, my feeling is that you'll do fine.  But if you wait a little bit, you may be able to buy cheaper, and then do even better.
disclaimer:  The above is pure speculation, and no one here can tell you anything definitive.  And even my guess has a bunch of wiggle room for me to be right without giving any great advice.

No problem.
Just to back up my statement that $2M is being spent daily on the exchanges (as opposed to your claim of $300,000), here's a link:  
Look at the main part of the page, the first line in the table (a giant green bar), far right. The last column has the total amount spent in the last 24 hours on Bitcoins (in both Bitcoins, ~59,000 BTC, and dollars ~$1.7M).  That first line is money exchanging hands at the largest exchange (Mt Gox).
If you sum up the last column of ALL the exchanges (all lines on the page), you'd get the total spent in the past 24 hours - but some of these numbers are in Euros or other currencies.  The top line is the vast majority, but you can see it's well over $300K.
And there's a 30-day volume over toward the left-center part of the page.

A few poorly worded sections of the article.  I'll list them here in case the author of the article cares.  No sense in posting them in the comments of trolls over there!


This is fairly inaccurate in a number of ways.  First, Confirmation in the network is designed to take about 10 minutes.  It can be much higher (like 50 minutes for one confirmation on some occasions) or it can be as quick as a minute.  But "it's 8 minutes, down from 10" is really wrong.  The network adjusts every two weeks, to try to keep it close to ten minutes.  There may be significant fluctuations, as miners join or release from the network, and with "luck" of the proof of work algorithm.
Second, "clear the network" might be more accurate as 6 confirmations.  1 is good.  6 is really really really good.  


Current implementation is 8 decimal places, but it's very likely that this could be extended over the course of 127 years!  Right now, there's nothing in the code to stop the coins from continuing to generate after 2140, but they still will stay under 21 Million.  The block reward gets cut in half roughly every 4 years, going on forever (not just till 2140) as it stands now.  The reason people say 2140 is because that's when the block reward is meaningless within the first 8 decimal places.


I have friends who have Bitcoins with no wallet.  Just a Private Key and a Bitcoin Address.  Some call it a paper wallet, but it's really not even that complicated.


10% is a little misleading, since this number (as he measures it) could theoretically be MUCH higher than 100%.  The maximum* it could get is if every coin changing hands every 10 minutes for 24 hours (1 confirmation) - so 144 times a day, or 14400%.  So 10/14400 % isn't really as high as he makes it sound.  (*This maximum might be low, if using zero confirmations!)
In reality, SatoshiDice is the cause of many coins changing hands numerous times a day.

First... I don't know what the original deal was, so I don't remember that.  I really am not here to defend BFL... I know nothing about them except what I read on here!
Second... I'm not so sure it'd be illegal for them to do *something like* what I described.  They could probably negotiate their way out of the "contracts" that they have in place, by offering to refund 55%, or whatever, (and explaining that there's a good possibility of bankruptcy if not enough people accept the offer).  That's just negotiations.  And people would be within their rights to decline, and take their chances with bankruptcy.
I don't know what premise they accepted the money though. My impression, purely from what I read on here, is that they are hated and bad mouthed for their delays, but that they really just got in over their heads technically.
@_date: 2013-02-26 09:37:15
yup I agree - that's a good deal all around.
It seems like since there is a general demand for buying bitcoins and an occasional need to ship money across the country, there's value in the transaction that can offset cost.  
What I am implying, though, is that a service could pop up that is like Western Union, providing this exact service for a reasonable price with a semi-voluntary network of people.  Localbitcoins could morph into it.
Which makes me ask myself "why don't I sign up as a seller on Localbitcoins?"  I think if they aspired to compete with Western Union like this, I'd have more interest in doing so.

It's pretty funny that people constantly are looking at localbitcoins and saying that there's no one near, but no one seems to think about listing themselves on there (as a buyer, in this case).
Not that it would be ideal for a quick purchase, but you might be surprised.
Also, if you listed your location HERE, someone might surprise you.  I'm willing to meet someone for a one-time purchase if they are close, but I don't particularly want an on-going listing on localbitcoins.

Did I say this?


Actually, if AMD issues stock, and you look at what happens when it's more in demand vs. less in demand, when it is more in demand, the company will typically get more money, at the issuance of the stock.  And this can impact the price of their products.  The more money a company has, the higher the economies of scale, so the lower the marginal cost.


In the first sentence you say currencies are suppose[d] to be used for storage, and in the second, you say it's problematic.  So you pretty much nullified any point you were trying to make in either sentence.

I think each of these instances is a chance to learn and to make the software more bullet-proof.  But all angles should be considered.  
The more important learning, I think, is to think through what would have happened if that was a blackhat exploit - a software bug known by a criminal (perhaps because he inserted it into the code), and intentionally exploited to perform a bunch of large double-spends, and conversions into other non-reversible currency.  How could that be quickly detected and thwarted.
I think what was learned yesterday was that the mechanisms to prevent such an attack are not yet implemented.

This is actually similar to what the dot-com bubble looked like.  You could launch a company and get funding pretty easily, with a business plan that promised eyeballs on web pages.  (No real business model, except selling advertising.)  Everyone was racing to run ads, to advertise their new eyeball-catching dotcom, and paying a premium to try to capture viewers.  So advertising pricing (and value) shot up drastically, by the very companies who were saying that eyeballs would be worth some outrageous value, because they were collectively driving the price up.
Then someone pointed out that the Emperor had no clothes.  Money quit flowing in, because venture guys couldn't pawn off their pets.com look-alike sites to anyone else.  And so they all quit advertising, and web advertising prices plummeted.  And so the value of each eyeball plummeted.  And so a bunch of spreadsheets had to be re-worked, showing that there was no way in hell that a company with no income could make money.
So, yeah, I agree.  Litecoin is in a bubble.

Well, those who have complaints with BitInstant can, and probably will, join your cause.  
But you are violating Reddit global rules by saying "please vote this up for visibility".   (I just found this out today.)  
I am not saying BitInstant is not at fault here.  They made some changes, and stuff broke.  If it were me, I would work rapidly and hard at figuring out what broke, and then fix it, and then I'd have data on what past problems need to be resolved.   Looking at other posts, I would say that they  have gotten past the "fix it" stage, and they are trying to address the past orders.
I really doubt they are trying to scam anyone!  But (as you know) you are one of MANY people who have had issues, and it takes time to get through the issues.  
I'd say make sure you followed their protocol to file a report, and then be patient.  When they get to the point where they say "we think we've resolved all of the issues", if you haven't been resolved, I think then you shout loudly.
But for now, enough people have brought up the issue, in enough ways, that you guys are causing them to have to split duty between responding to rude complaints in forums and solving your problem.  
By this point everyone knows there was a pretty big issue.  No one has to say any more to get that point across.  And now they have to do their job and resolve it.  Let's not slow them down by creating more jobs for them.

There was an article yesterday about how Amex and Twitter had a partnership to pay via Tweets.  Do that.
Basically, a coinbase user would register their twitter account with you, and establish a spending limit (per tweet and/or per day, month, or other time period).  They may also register their "ship to" information.
Then, a merchant or charitable organization can register with you for certain promotions.  Say, for example, The Red Cross registers a hashtag as " so that anyone who tweets to it will be contributing .01 bitcoins automatically, if registered.
Red Cross links their deposit account to the hashtag (through your service), and customer links their Coinbase payment account through you.
Then someone tweets including the hashtag   Your software picks up the tweet via Twitter's API, tweets back to the user to confirm the transaction with some other tweet instructions.  When the user tweets back, you move money from the coinbase user's account to the Red Cross's bitcoin address on file.
Same logic for promotions from businesses.  If Walmart offers some 1 Bitcoin item to any registered users who tweet " you listen for that tweet, and move the money, and give walmart the name and address of the tweeter, so the product can ship.
Please send me a cut!  It's like Groupon for Bitcoin - in a way.
(it'd be GREAT to show that anything that the traditional credit cards can do, Bitcoin can do better.)

The protocol has a way to handle this.  This is an expected fork in the chain, and it happens periodically - somewhat regularly.  This is expected, and somewhat different than the fork that happened a few days ago (due to a software bug).
Basically, there is a "tie-breaking" procedure, such that the more difficult the solution, the better.
So, when someone solves the block, they publish their solution, and other miners accept it (if the math checks out), and they begin to work on the next block.  Meanwhile someone somewhere else on the network may have also solved the same block (different transactions, but the same block number), and they advertise their solution.  A miner will discard the less complex solution at this point.
However, it's possible at this point that a miner that was working on the less complex solution has solved the subsequent block.  Now their two block solution may emerge as a more complex solution than the one-block solution.  So as you can see, it's important to advertise your solution quickly and widely (so people accept it, and begin building on your solution).
This is why 6 confirmations are important.  One confirmation can "easily" be over-ridden.  And if the money was spent differently in two competing blocks (double-spent), then it's possible you accepted bitcoins that will not actually be yours.  
After 2 confirmations, this is FAR less likely.  And 3, it's extremely unlikely.  6 Confirmations (in normal network conditions) makes it virtually impossible to have a transaction over-turned.
The other day, the bug caused a much greater window for double-spends - something like 16 blocks.  But it was quickly resolved, with minimal damage.

Miners don't increase supply.  [Supply is relatively fixed]( regardless of how many miners there are.
I suppose an argument could be made that the more miners there are, the more costly it is to mine, and therefore mined bitcoins need to be sold to pay for the mining, but I think that's a circular argument, because more people have incentive to mine when the price is high and the payoff is better.

The only reason Litecoin transactions are faster is because it's less in use, so it takes less time to tell everyone that a transaction occurred.  This is a "feature" of being poorly accepted.
Or, if you are referring to faster confirmations (which is NOT what you said), you may have an argument there, but it is at the expense of less secure confirmations.

Your stats are way off.
The wealthiest single address has 111,111 BTC in it, which is about 1% of all wealth.
  
The stat you might be referring to is that (as of a year ago), about 25% of all wealth was in individual addresses containing exactly 50 BTC.  There were about 40,000 bitcoin addresses containing exactly 50 BTC - the implication being that many have just sat there after being mined.  But there's no way to know if one individual controls the vast majority of those addresses.

I can easily write a program to watch transactions, looking for "identified" bitcoin addresses where a nickname is linked to the address.  
If OP's bullet is correct..


... then it's trivial to grab the wallet given the identifier programmatically.

If you have a plan of "buy and hold", then you may want to send your bitcoins to a "paper wallet" (you can print one at a number of sites.  bitaddress.org seems to be one that people trust.)    Once your money is on paper, it's hard to have it stolen online.
It's probably not advisable to store them at LibertyBit (I know nothing about them, but storing your money online is risky).  You may want to get a wallet on your PC, like electrum or armory.  Go to bitcoin.org for details.  
There's also the bitcoin-qt wallet, but that takes a really long time to download the blockchain (probably days).

Interestingly, there's nothing in the "math" that brings the subsidy to zero.  It's in the implementation, because COIN is 10^8 currently.
I would expect that before forty years from now, the COIN constant will be made larger (say, 10^16 ), and then coin production won't stop in 2140, like everyone says.  There is frequent discussion about how bitcoin is infinitely divisible, and making COIN bigger is how that could be done.  (Also we'd use integers bigger than 64 bit, change the protocol, etc...)
The current implementation won't start truncating satoshis for 40 years, when we need the precision of that 9th decimal place (we'll need one in 2017, for Block Reward of 12.5 BTC, two four years later, etc).
But still, the mathematical "limit" of the infinite sum is 21 Million, even if coin generation goes on much longer than Year 2140.

You DON'T need to use an external service to do this!  That's the beauty of Bitcoin.

The exact circumstances of issue  are:
I decided to transfer some number of Bitcoins out of coinbase and into my paper wallet.  Call that number X.  My current balance was bigger than X, but less than 2X.  But I had about 3X of Pending BUY orders.
I sent X Bitcoins to my paper wallet.  It showed up as a verifiable transaction in the Blockchain.  In Coinbase, it showed up as "You sent bitcoins to 1xxxxx", that is, my correct paper wallet.  And then I noticed that my account balance was negative.  I thought hmm....  
Then a little while later, I noticed a second transaction that said "You sent bitcoins to an external account" (with no bitcoin address).  Now I was getting nervous!  I checked the blockchain, and there were 2 transactions, spaced about 2 or 3 blocks apart, that were to my offline wallet for the same amount:  X bitcoins.
No big deal, because i would have moved them there anyway eventually, but definitely a bug that needs to be looked at, because this is going to cost someone some serious bucks!  I happen to be paying myself, but had I been paying a stripper in Eastern Europe, I'd never see that second money again!
Since then, some of my pending transactions (purchases) went through, so my account is positive again.  Once all my pending purchases go through, I am going to transfer it all out, and let Coinbase mature for a while.  
The site has promise, but it's a little immature and buggy.

Watching what the price has done in the 29's convinces me that it has tons of support.  There's a giant wall at 30.  And some have bailed out in the 29s, but it just keeps walking that wall, and chipping a tiny chunk off.
I think you're right, although I am anxious to see what happens when it passes 32-something (it's all time high, whatever that was).  Because there are some people who have been cursing for 2 years, saying "I was a fool!  if it ever hits 32 again, I am out".  And then there will be tons of press and more people saying "what's Bitcoin?" - which could push it up much higher than 35.

I think you should change your parameters.  Send Bitcoins to people who talk up bitcoins in public forums.   
They should make a public comment, and then submit a link to you.  You can distribute the freebies any way you want, but it seems to me you should rate based on the intelligence of the comment, and the size of the audience.
If someone says something very positive and intelligent to a lot of people, they should be rewarded.

Good work Mike.
The micropayment idea that I like is called "Ellison" - named after Larry Ellison who, as a rich guy, suggested that he should be able to buy his way to the front of every line (such as waiting at the DMV to renew your drivers license, waiting in the airport frisk line, etc).
GPS and Near Field Communication can be used to negotiate line swapping on your cell phone.  Price competition would keep the prices in check (assuming that more than one person in line was using the application)  - example:  I can swap with the 3rd person in line for 1 mBTC, or the 6th for 1.2 mBTC, of course, I would swap with 
This works best with 'take a number' queues, rather than physical queues.  
So I envision this as two applications.  One is a number-issuing app (installed on one device/PC at the DMV, Great Clips, Airport TSA line, etc), and the other is the "Join a Queue" app used by the person waiting in line.
So, from in-person (using Near Field Communications or QR codes) or distant (using a website), a person can join a queue.  (I plan on being at the DMV later today.  I navigate to joinaqueue.com, search for DMV on Elm Street, and join the queue.  Someone else shows up at the DMV and waves their smartphone in front of the PC, and they join the queue.)  This app can keep me up-to-date on the length of the queue, and when my turn is expected.
Through micro-payments, people can negotiate their way to the front of the queue, or sell their spot in queue.
This would also work at Disney World!

Another addition:  Mining is like trying to find a needle in a haystack, as I said before.  But the haystack is re-sized every two weeks (actually every 2016 blocks, which works out to be approximately every 2 weeks), based on how fast people are finding the needle.  If they tend to find the needle faster than every ten minutes, then more hay is added.  If they tend to find it slower than every ten minutes, then hay is removed.

bitaddress.org is pretty unique in that you can open that web page, and then COMPLETELY disconnect from the internet.  Then generate as many addresses as you want.

Ah, so it will go over 110.63, meet resistance at around 112, at which point *it could go down or it could go up.*  Very bold.


Shoot, so *that very bold prediction wasn't correct.*  rats.
Again yesterday:


OK, so *it will go up sometime, but potentially it might go down first.*  Now you're really out on that limb...
Again yesterday:


ok, so a vague prediction of *"around 112" with no timeframe* came true.  Amazing, Kreskin.  So now you predict that it won't stay below "for very long" (is that minutes or years?).   And then it will break above, with the potential for bear traps (again, so *it could go either way*).  Damn.. how can you sleep at night with such ballsy predictions!


 
OK, at least we have some timeframes now.  So yesterday, when it was at around 112, the 8 week bear is over.  So cool. So it must be above 112 today. (checking:  $107.90.  rats.)
Eight hours later:


oh no.  The 8 week bear may not be over - we could hit 100.  OK, *so if we go down, you will be correct.  and if we go up, you are also correct.*  I think you might be right this time!
16 hours later:


OK, whew.  *some time in the non-committal future, it will go up.*  That's what we wanted to hear.

But, at $100/BTC, $360,000 of NEW INTEREST in Bitcoin needs to be generated every day, just to maintain the current value and absorb the newly minted coins.
If the Chinese (or the friends of Winklevoss, or whomever) were moving $360,000 (or really more like $400K) from fiat to Bitcoins every day, then the daily fluctuations would only be due to the number of people cashing out.  
Right now, the fluctuations are due to both people caching out AND more coins (inflation).
You are nearly correct with your figures, (assuming that the 1 BTC always went from one spender to the next one - otherwise it needs to go to an exchange and back each time, tripling the amount of movement.)

So really there are two things going on.  One is that speculators place value in bitcoin, taking the price from Falkvinge's $1.12 price to something roughly 2 orders of magnitude higher.  The other is price manipulation.
I suspect that the price manipulation is occurring in the 2 order of magnitude range... say from 1.9 orders of magnitude to 2.1 orders of magnitude (for example).   The price manipulation is NOT what took the exchange rate from $1.12 to $142.  
Price manipulation might be the cause of fluctuations between, say, $60 and $150.   But the $60 as compared to $1.12 is really the value that speculators are putting on the likelihood that Bitcoin catches on.
Said another way, if 99% of the money supply is held by speculators, then Falkvinge's pricing method should use the velocity of money and determine a price for the remaining 1% that *is* being used for purchases.  Meaning that the exchange rate will be 100x greater than the $1.12 value he came up with - or $112.  And the manipulation is occurring, wiggling the price from $112 to $142.

It's worked for me as well.  But when I did it (multiple times), I specified on the Bitinstant website that I wanted Bitcoins, and provided an address.
Now it looks like that's not an option.  So you might need to send the money to Gox or something, which might be the cause for the delay and problems - not sure.
I have read some people mention that Bitinstant is "out of bitcoins", but I don't believe that's the case, because a) it'd be easy for them to get more, and b) the option has been turned off every time I have checked in the past two weeks.

Mike Caldwell (the Cassius Coin  guy), at the Bitcoin Conference, was suggesting that we should consider the option of individuals carrying small Bitcoin Bills (like denominations amounting to $10 or $20), with the private key on it.
To spend, you would allow the vendor to scan in the private key, and then create a transaction paying themselves a limited about of it.
He says consumers are already used to that level of risk by handing over a debit card (or cash for that matter), and trusting that the vendor won't run off with it.
(Of course, an unscrupulous waiter/clerk could take a photo for later use, but I suppose they could copy your debit/credit card info too.)

The higher the price, the more daily influx of new interest is required.

The biggest issues that Coinbase has to deal with is fraud and risk.  They are trying to balance that with controlled growth.

I don't think I want to see him show his methodology, as it involves reaching into his butt...
On a more serious note, I've been showing people [an analysis that I did back in early July]( based on the market cap.  And it works out to a price right around $50, right around Sept 20th.
The logic is that the "network effect" of growing interest seems to have its ebbs and flows (bubble and pop, whatever), but it's leading to a sustained, somewhat predictable growth in the amount of world wealth stored in Bitcoins.  This amount is generally following the red line on my graph, which is growing at 18.7% per month.  
As a bubble forms, we pull away from that line, and then we eventually return to the line.  It's happened 3 times, and we're nearing the end of the 4th cycle.
The cycle lengths vary, but you can measure them from the day that it touches the line, to the day that it's furthest from the line - the peak - the top of the bubble, and call those "up days", and then measure the peak back down to when it touches the line, and call those down days.  
You can see the length of these cycles historically.
The flaws in this methodology is that there's nothing that will say that the past will be similar to the future.  And also, the price could stay at around 100 until February '14, at which time the red line would meet the market value.  (in other words, even if you believe in this methodology, waiting for it to hit $50 would be greedy - you're fine buying in a $100).
So there's my analysis that says $50.
And I get down-voted every time I post this, because people don't like short-term bears, even though this equates to a +15% PER MONTH price gain on an ongoing basis, which is EXTREMELY BULLISH, but just not starting at today's price, starting at a lower price.  (The difference between the +15% price gain, and the 18.7% market cap gain is attributed to more coins being available.)

You may want to check your transaction fees.  Assuming you are using Gox, with the standard commission, it would look like this:
Sell a coin at 30.8 "ish"  (um, so what, 30.75???)  ok, we'll say 30.8.  Net= $30.6152 (if you are paying 0.6% fee).  Buy at 29.8, with the 0.6% fee, these cost you 29.9788.   So you were able to buy 1.022456 coins for each coin you had previously.
So not 3% more.  More like 2.2% more.  But you made Gox a little richer.
And if you did it on Coinbase, that was even closer to a break-even transaction.   if you did it with Bitinstant, you lost money.
Think long term, people!  That measly 2.2% increase (this time) is not worth the risk.  I saw people sell at the $17 "bubble", only to buy back at 25.   In three years, 2-digit prices will be a distant memory, so it's not worth risking trying to time the market!  You won this time (barely), but it's not worth the risk.  **It's like gambling where the house (Gox) has a 1.2% edge!**

Yeah, Coinbase may not be buying them from you (but then again, when you sell Gox, Gox isn't buying from you either - they are an exchange that facilitates the transfer between 2 parties).

Bitcoin transactions exempt after one year
Parliamentary inquiry creates clarity in controversial question by Daniel Eckert and Kathrin Gotthold 
With Bitcoins winnings will be tax-free after one year. Thus, the digital money from the Treasury treated differently than, for example, stocks, bonds or certificates. All of these asset classes are subject to withholding tax of 25 percent plus solidarity surcharge and church tax. In bitcoins falls after a holding period of one year on the other hand, no such tax.
The tax exemption of capital gains in Bitcoins findings of a parliamentary inquiry that has provided to the federal government the FDP financial expert Frank Schaeffler and the "world" exists. "It is good that investments in Bitcoins is finally legal certainty. Private profits from the sale of Bitcoins are tax-free after one year," said Schaeffler.
The legal nature and tax treatment of digital currency has been controversial for a long time. The response of the Federal Government clarifies this. For fans of cyber-currency, it covers a lot of money. Despite strong fluctuations in the price of Bitcoin is now more than twelve times as high as twelve months ago. The tax treatment for investors is therefore of great importance.
An example illustrates this: in online exchanges like bitcoin.de or mtgox.com 100 Bitcoins could be acquired in mid-2012 for about 550 euros. Today, the same amount is worth about 7600 euros. Event of a sale after more than twelve months holding period therefore falls to a gain of about 7000 euro. The flat tax would strike here at 1750 euros.
Legally, it is the purchase and sale of Bitcoin is a private sale transaction under Section 23 paragraph 1 sentence 2 of the Income Tax Act, which (according to section 2, paragraph 1, sentence 1, No. 7 Income Tax Act) of the income tax. Control is by law to collect in these transactions only if the period "between buying and selling no longer than one year." Bitcoins are enjoying increasing popularity in the Internet community, but also a playground for speculators. They allow the cost payment for goods and services on the Internet without the need for a traditional bank account or a credit card is required. More than 2,000 companies worldwide organization and accept the digital money now.
Bitcoins were introduced in 2009 by a Japanese cryptographer named Satoshi Nakamoto, who wanted to create an absolutely tamper-proof money for the cyber universe by his own admission. However, the name appears to be a pseudonym. The true identity of the programmer is unknown. The virtual currency is characterized in that the total number of Bitcoins is limited by an algorithm. Bitcoins are created by computer operations (experts speak of "mining"), which can only be done by computers. They can be exchanged at several online exchange for paper currencies such as Euros or dollars.
In the year 2140 the maximum will be reached with 21 million digital coins. Right from the year 2033 no significant amounts of new Bitcoins are created more. Today, about half of all computable coins in the world. Limiting the amount Bitcoin Bitcoin makes interesting for investors to put the fact that the demand will increase. With a slowly growing Bitcoin offer that should lead to rising prices in the long term, is their calculus. However, digital currencies supervisors and central banks are an eyesore. Strict regulation or a total ban, the risks. Economists evaluate bitcoins as "private money", which also means that they are not legal tender.
The FDP financial expert coopers, who made the request, is also known as "Euro-rebels" because he has repeatedly voted in parliament against the rescue policy. The liberals advocated the abolition of the central bank monopoly. It is economically damaging, if a central body such as the ECB controlling the money supply, and be guided by political motives.

I think you mean exponential growth.
Seems to me exponential growth will continue until the cost to make and run a new ASIC is break-even.  I'm not referring to retail price of an ASIC, I mean the cost to make it and then run it (electricity-wise).
Since the huge capital cost to manufacture ASICs has already been paid, now the marginal cost to crank out the machine is relatively low.  The electricity costs, while not zero, are far less than the GPUs.
So difficulty will probably continue to rise aggressively for some time (six months?).

You can check out localbitcoins.com for a local seller.  Use normal security precautions, as if you were meeting someone from Craigs List (public place, make sure you know what you are buying, etc.)
Coinbase has great potential, if you have a bank account.  But lately they have been extremely flakey, and impossible to buy from.  Coins are disappearing, transactions are disappearing.  not good.
I've had good luck with bitinstant.com.  Fill out the form on their website, and buy your coins at Walmart or CVS.  It's a little expensive (~5%), but it is absolutely the fastest way I have securely bought coins.
If you are a total noob, and are buying them to stick in a drawer for a rainy day, and want to buy today and figure it out later, then go to bitaddress.org and generate a bitcoin address ("paper wallet").  Use Bitinstant to buy at Walmart or CVS and send the coins straight to the address on that piece of paper.  
If you are super paranoid, load the bitaddress.org page in a "private browser window" and disconnect from the internet.  Then print it, reboot your machine.  Save a few copies.  Then fund the Bitcoin Address via Bitinstant.

yeah, but if you have been sitting on 100,000 BTC, and not tipping, funding faucets, using it to buy stuff, etc., then you would be pretty foolish or miserly.
The heroes are the ones who invested early (either by buying or mining), and throw the money around because they know that getting it in the hands of others is the way to make the rest of their money worth more.
Also, it might have been difficult to buy a big block of BTC without driving the price up.  100,000 is the amount created in 2 weeks.  If you happened to buy in the first year, you would have had to buy 1/26th of all the outstanding coins.  Some people just weren't sellers!

Having experienced the introductions of credit cards first-hand, I'd say that there wasn't really a push to get people to go into debt.  (although clearly that was the long term effect.)  Remember, in the US, that generation was a bunch of savers - with likely a memory of the Depression and WW II.
The ads were just trying to get people to use the darn things.  Bank Americard - what later evolved to Visa - would get a cut of every transaction.  People already had charge cards (that had to be paid off every month) with various merchants, but it was cumbersome to have a card for each store.
See [wikipedia-Visa](

One mitigation technique that could be built into the software, that is not mentioned, is this:
Currently, bitcoind tries to connect to 8 random nodes.  As one connection is lost, it *randomly* chooses a known node to connect to.
A process could be added whereby bitcoind (and other full nodes) periodically try to improve the overall network topology by eliminating their most redundant connection and adding on a distant connection with less redundancy.
This would involve querying your connections to find out who they are connected to (which is already done), but also maintaining (and transmitting) a topology map:  I'm connected to these 8 nodes, and each of them is connected to these 8, respectively, and so on.
Once the topology is understood (which is definitely always changing), bitcoind would seek out a connection to the furthest known point (e.g. "it takes me 20 hops to get to x.x.x.x.  Let me cut that to 1, with a direct connection), and drop off the most redundant connection (e.g. "if I break this direct connection, I can still get to it in 4 hops via this other route")
Such an algorithm would dramatically cut the propagation delay.

I'm going to challenge you on this one:    


Curious why you say that.  I would think that a randomly generated (or extremely well formed brainwallet) key would be easier to protect than multiple instances of the same.
You must think that the difficulties of generating an a really random, or secure, key are greater than the difficulties of safely managing multiples of these.
I guess the recent problems with Android and Blockchain's randomness are evidence in your favor.

OK, so according to that link, when a P2Pool miner creates coins, they specify who gets the Block Reward in the Coinbase transaction, based on who created the recently created coins for the pool.  And then they identify themselves as a recipient of future created coins.
So, to me, that looks like a P2Pool miner is creating coins, and immediately distributing them to other miners, while specifying that he is to be rewarded by coins that are created later.
Based on my read, I would think then that a P2Pool miner is subject to FinCEN registration.

By leaving them in your Bitstamp account, you are trusting that company.  A lot of things can (and have) gone wrong with this sort of trust arrangement.
In the past, places have shut down because the trusted person was a crook.  They've also been shut down because they were robbed, and their security was lax (and YOU are the one out the coins).  They have been shut down due to business circumstances (old Tradehill got nailed with huge chargebacks, and had to close their doors).  They also have been regulated out of business.
So, yeah, if you are more comfortable with that risk, you're fine.  But the key feature of Bitcoin is that you don't need to trust other people.  Be your own bank!

Blockchain.info hides the complexities of Private Keys from you, so if you JUST use Blockchain.info's wallet feature, then you can disregard the advice.
However, if you use paper wallets (go to  and wait 10 seconds, and you'll have a paper wallet example, to see what I mean), you will have a private key and a bitcoin address.   You can fund the Bitcoin address (by PAYING to it from, say coinbase or MtGox or blockchain.info), but the private key is your key to be able to SPEND it.  
So, say, if you send money to the Bitcoin Address on a paper wallet.  Now the money is in that account.  You can verify it by going to blockchain.info, and on the home page, keying in the bitcoin address, and it will show you the balance, like this:
  (random account)
Note that the Bitcoin address starts with a "1", while the private key (on bitaddress.org, for example) starts with a "5".  Anytime you expose the "5" number on the internet (by "importing private key" function), you probably want to spend the money in that account, unless you are super careful or trusting.

My understanding is - and I am no expert - that the miners listen and have a queue of unconfirmed transactions.  They pick some from the queue and try to solve a block.  (Usually, I would think they'd pick ALL from the queue, or all with fees, at least).
I believe it isn't harder to solve a block with more transactions in it, so they usually grab as many as they can, and go to work.  Also, adding more transactions later isn't like "starting over" - since solving the block is really random.
So unconfirmed transactions remain unconfirmed, and on every user's system, including the miners. Next block, they'll grab some more from the unconfirmed transactions and get to work on those.

Past experience has shown that when a weakness in an encryption algorithm is found, there is usually ample time to port to something stronger.  Presumably Bitcoin could do the same thing - somehow.

Blockchain.info has an interesting security model.  You aren't trusting them with your Bitcoins.  Instead, you are trusting that they are really securing it in the way that they claim to be securing it.
Assuming that they are trustworthy (and I have no reason not to, but I mention that since this thread is basically about trusting no one but yourself), then yes, you are on the right track.  If they go out of business, you still can access your Bitcoins with a recent wallet. 
Even if they are trustworthy, things to watch out for:  
-  Make sure you have a recent wallet (not "if you download the wallet once" as you said).
-  Key Loggers on your PC could bypass the security mechanisms that they have in place.
-  A risk has been mentioned that someone could hack their site and give you bad JavaScript, and I believe there is a browser plug-in to even prevent this.  (This is cool, and reinforces the concept that blockchain.info really has their shit together - they have identified a "long shot" potential security issue and provided a solution even to that!)

Coinbase has a merchant interface.  I believe Mt. Gox does too.  And then there are merchants who have their own interfaces.  And then there are the exchanges, who act as merchants when they let you buy fiat for Bitcoins.
So if a majority of merchants follow one fork, that's the fork you want to win.

Hmm interesting stat about the subreddits.
Litecoin has almost twice as many coins in circulation, and 422K blocks vs. 258K Bitcoin blocks in the blockchain.  The sheer creation rate could be a factor in the number of keys holding them.
From my perspective, I have helped about 20 people obtain Bitcoins, yet none of them have Litecoins.  They barely can be considered Bitcoin "users", although they "hold" a fair amount of value in Bitcoins.  They certainly aren't involved in subreddits.
So from my statistically insignificant sample of 1 (me), I tend to think that there are far more individuals involved in Bitcoin than Litecoin.  Merchant acceptance is probably 100 to 1, in favor of Bitcoin, not 3-to-1. [Google Trends]( puts interest at about 10 to 1.
It would be interesting to find out the stats.

The probationary limit for Coinbase is now 10 Bitcoins per day.  I believe it was formerly $100.
Coinbase is a real simple way for people to get started.  If OP is in the US, he should definitely give it a try.
For long term storage, I think the best bet is bitaddress.org, printing a paper wallet, and sending the coins to the paper wallet.  It's hard for a virus to steal your paper wallet.  
OP: if you are paranoid, go to bitaddress.org and "save the web page" using your browser Save function.  Then power off your PC, disconnect the internet (but not your printer), turn off wireless.  Power up, find the webpage on your local drive, use it to generate a paper wallet, and print a few copies.  Then power off and reconnect and power back on.

The two examples I cited, [Apple 1]( and [HP-01]( (Hewlett Packard WRIST  WATCH) often sell for more than the original retail price.
I agree, there *probably* isn't much demand for the first batch of Gateway computers that were ever created (although you might be surprised).  The first series of Compaq's probably go for a decent price, though.  
The point is, if marketed and labeled as a "first generation", you might actually get a premium from some speculators.

Propagation speed matters to miners to avoid solving a block and having it orphaned.  Propagation speed matters to vendors who want to make sure they don't accept a transaction that gets double-spent.

One common belief is that the "majority of the full nodes" is the determination of power (and ultimately, the rules) in Bitcoin.  Others believe that it is the "majority of the miners".
I contend that it has now shifted to be "the majority of the people who accept bitcoin for goods, services, and fiat".  This is what ultimately gives Bitcoin it's value - the ability to use it, spend it, etc.
I contend that if there was a fork, the ultimate surviving branch would be the one that Mt. Gox, Bitpay, Coinbase, and just a few other major players sided with.  If a fork occurred, my bitcoins would appear on Bitcoin-A and Bitcoin-B, but they would have far more "value" on the blockchain where they can be spent.  And this is a viscous cycle:  I won't want to accept payment on blockchain-A if they are much more valuable on blockchain-B (causing further decline in value of Blockchain-A, and ultimately its demise).
I would love to see this author cover this angle (or dispute it).

There are two major components that are making up the perceived value (i.e. market price) of Bitcoins currently:  Utility and Speculation.  Currently, they aren't that useful, practically speaking.  So the vast majority of the exchange price is based on the "chance" that they will become more useful.
Someday, that chance will be resolved (one way or the other).  At that point, the "speculation" part of the market price will become a MUCH smaller portion of the overall price, and the "utility" part will be the greater portion.
As more and more retailers embrace Bitcoin, the price will stabilize.  The speculation portion will be reduced substantially, as the "upside" goes away.  But the price will stabilize at a much bigger number than it is at now (if a bunch of retailers embrace Bitcoin).
Currently, the market price is probably 99% based on "the potential future" (speculation), and 1% on the current utility of Bitcoin.   When it's 1%-99% the other way, there won't be much fluctuation at all.

No.  I was describing a biraddress.org paper wallet, which some people use as an offline storage (i.e. a long term, offline savings account).
For **daily** usage, you would use either a client like bitcoin-qt (which is a "heavy" client and has the entire block-chain), or a light client or a web-based service (e.g. coinbase, blockchain.info, instawallet).  Each case has slightly different mechanics, but they all end up in the same place:
When you send someone money, your private key is used SECRETLY to sign the transaction (so you aren't revealing it to the recipient, you are merely using the power of math to "prove that you have it").  The math is set up so that you can prove that you hold the key without sharing it with anyone.
In the cases of web-based clients (coinbase, blockchain.info, etc), you are entrusting them with your private keys (in fact, in the typical case, they generate the private key, and you really aren't even exposed to that complexity).   The cool thing about the savings account (paper wallet) is that you can store that piece of paper, and just retain the Bitcoin Address for online use.  Then you can see the balance anytime, and contribute more to the Bitcoin Address, even though the private key has never been online.  You'll need the piece of paper (the Private Key) some day when you want to spend them.
In the bitaddress.org method, you actually can see the private key, store it, and ensure that it never was online (for maximum protection against virus-theft).

An old stock market adage regarding insider trading is that Insiders may sell for a myriad of reasons - need money for their daughter's wedding, portfolio is out of balance, tax issues, etc.  Insiders buy for only one reason - that they believe the stock will go up.
Same thing here.   If I held a substantial portion of my wealth in Bitcoins, I'd probably sell some to diversify.  I'd use these little peaks to diversify my holdings, and sell some Bitcoins. 
I suspect most old-timers see the long term value, but may just want to protect their wealth through diversification.

Bitcoin-QT is not designed to save your coins if you delete your wallet.dat file.  I'm not sure why you would conclude that you could delete your wallet.dat file.
You are seeing something that is purposely designed into Bitcoin-QT, that you might not be understanding because you are adding the complexity of an alternate paper wallet.
The bitcoin client is managing A BUNCH of addresses for you, including auto-created change addresses.  Paper wallets only manage **one**.  If you delete your wallet.dat file without backup, you are deleting access to ALL of your addresses.

Some good tips on paper wallets over here:  
The benefit of having multiple offline wallets is that you can open them at different times (or potentially instruct others to open them, without risking your whole stash.)
You may decide to tier your holdings, spreading them over multiple online and offline wallets.  Maybe quantity x in one wallet, 2x in another, 4x in another.  (or x, 10x, 100x).  That way you can spend when you want to.
You may also want to test a paper wallet with a small amount of money - go through the whole process of creating it, funding it, and spending it.
If you are mailing a paper wallet, I would definitely mail it before I fund it.  Make sure it's sealed well, and you can see if it's been tampered with.  Definitely keep your keys in two different places.

Whether B makes sense is really a matter of how the terms of the mortgage are set up.  Consider these two different terms:
Mortgage Terms   Perhaps the terms say that the monthly mortgage is $600, and you must pay in Bitcoins, and the conversion rate is the spot price at midnight on the 1st of the month.
Mortgage Terms   Perhaps the terms say that the monthly mortgage payment is 4 BTC (which is roughly the going exchange rate *today* of $600).
If you believe that the price of Bitcoins is going to rise a lot over the next few years, and you have terms  then you absolutely want to pay down that principle.  Because 4 bitcoins can reduce the principle, and eliminate some 4 bitcoin payments in the last year of the mortgage (when they will be worth a ton)!
And if the mortgage is truly a "bitcoin-based mortgage", which it's said to be, it's  type.  (Substitute "Euros" for "Bitcoins" to see why I say that.  No one in Europe commits to a mortgage rate that includes an exchange to dollars first.)

I like that plan.  Every time you acquire some bitcoins, note that you also spent them, by noting recent closed auctions.  Then there's no one who can notice your capital gains - nothing suspicious.  And no issue that you "consumed" the items (or disposed of them, or whatever) years later during the audit.
Of course, I'd never do this, I just like to read interesting plans contrived by clever, sometimes criminal-minded people.   (that's my plausible deniability statement.)

*IF* there was merit to this story (and I am not saying there is), and if what they are saying is that some people "in the know" have placed a gigantic bet on the Euro falling, then surely they have moved the market.
Taking a massive short position on the Euro now would be the equivalent of "buying at the top" of a stock that has been bid up by huge purchases.  Sure, you may do ok.  Or you may lose your ass.  Efficient market theorists would say that market pricing reflects the risk/reward.  If the markets are inefficient, then you'd be "overpaying" by taking a massive short position on Euro.

Scary thing is that it was the EU who demanded the deal from the Cyprus government.  So this was not even "Cyprus's own" government who created this situation.

The more wide-spread the user base, especially in the US, the more outraged the people will be to a US smack down of BTC.
You can bet that lobbyists for Visa, MC, Paypal, etc., are putting together a strategy to legislate them somehow, just like lobbyists for the recording and motion picture industries lobby to fight online activities that hurt their businesses.  I think the risk for Visa, MC, Paypal, etc., is that if they call attention to Bitcoin, then they will really take off.
The status quo industry giants like Visa/MC could actually try to pull off a 51% attack with ASICs in the short term.  Long term, ASICs are good, but there definitely is a short term risk.
And the US kicking BTC down hard... hmm ... oddly, the US stands for freedom, liberty, and all that, but they definitely could see BTC as a risk to their ability to defend freedom (or justify crushing it in some back-ass-wards way).  Really, it's more about which industry buys their politicians better, the old-line status-quo banking industry, or the merchants trying to cut out the 3% CC tax.

Exactly.  Due to program trading and "day trading" in the stock market, a significant portion of the daily volume can be attributed to the same shares being exchanged multiple times.
Bitcoin is no different in that respect.  The vast majority of the Bitcoins are held tightly, and a small amount is being used as currency (and for day trading and program trading).  
Falkvinge's analysis of the Money Supply Value being $13M could be divided by the amount of bitcoins "in play", to factor out the buy-and-hold-speculators and arrive at an exchange rate that factors them out. 
(not that I have any notion of how you would calculate the "in play" volume.  Perhaps a blockchain analysis using days destroyed could arrive at this value?)

Selling at 250 is NOT what accomplishes that.

Since I can't predict that 250 is the top, or that 50 is the bottom, and since I am a buyer, not a "trader", I simply buy a lot more when it's down than when it's up.  Dollar-cost-averaging accomplishes this without even having to think about it.

Not at all.  It's just human nature that walls form.
It's just because people will tend to choose round numbers to put in a bid or an asking price.  People are MUCH more likely to choose the number 50.00 than say 51.67 (or other odd-like number).  So a wall forms around the "round" numbers, event though there's nothing particularly special about them.
Look at it this way:  People who have a LOT of their wealth tied up in Bitcoins often sell some, as a way to diversify.  If you had, say, $500,000 in wealth, and $485,000 of it was in Bitcoins, you'd probably choose to sell some too, no matter how "bullish" you were about Bitcoins.
People sell for LOTS of reasons - to diversify, to pay a large bill, to buy some cool stuff.  But there's usually only TWO reasons people buy: To spend Bitcoins (for their utility), or because they believe the price will go up.  And there are a LOT of people buying right now.
Think about ten years from now, when people are talking about Bitcoin as much as they mention Facebook.  At that point, $50 per Bitcoin will seem like SUCH a bargain.

Not sure what you mean by that.
When you are running Bitcoin-QT, it will update the Block Chain, and keep it updated.  New transactions will come at you continuously, and new blocks will be locked about every ten minutes.
Anytime you want to spend money, you'll want to fire up Bitcoin-QT and get synched.  If you leave it running, you will always be synchronized.  If you turn it off for a few days, it might take some time to get updated.
Is that what you were asking?

Don't think of "coins" - think of a giant ledger keeping track of all the account balances.  And this ledger exists on the internet (in a peer-to-peer network, so there are a bunch of copies all over the place).
Your wallet contains your account numbers and your proof that you own those accounts (private keys).  So if you have the same wallet on 2 computers, both computers can view and spend those balances.  But you can't double spend, because the ledger of your account balances are on a bunch of other computers on the internet as well.
NOTE: The big issue with opening a copy of the same wallet on two computers is that your "account numbers" can get out of sync.  If you send from one, you might get "change" back at a different address... and all of the sudden your two wallets aren't the same any more.
So don't do that!

Ah.  gotcha.  I'm no expert on this, but I'll tell you what (I think) I know:
There are two different ways to generate vanity addresses.  You describe a program on your local computer.  This definitely would be a concern, if vanitygen program searched sequentially.  I would hope that it wouldn't, because that would be brain-dead stupid.  But i haven't looked at the open source.
The second way is what I was speaking about, and what I sent a link for.  Basically you generate half the private key on your local machine, and transmit a function of that to a vanitygen provider.  There are vanitygen pools which then take that, and brute-force until they find a match with your chosen prefix of your Bitcoin Address.  In this case, you are providing the randomness, so that's why you can rely on it being random, and not sequential.
But you do bring up an interesting point in the local running of vanitygen.

1. "in constant flux" makes it sound like the quantity will rise and fall.  It's a very predictable and documented mining schedule.
2.  I have no problem buying memory or a disk drive (bytes), knowing that I can get more for the same price tomorrow.  If I have a need today, I satisfy it.
3.  Bitcoin is not "tied to the dollar" any more than bread is.
4.  no comment on point 4, except to say no comment...
5.  It seems like the main thing that people are buying with Bitcoins is fiat currency (i.e. every trade).  I don't think this is illegal.  The second biggest thing that people are buying seems to be gambling - probably not illegal.  Somewhere down the list is illegal stuff.
6.  Again with the hoard logic, eh?  If I can get a "cash discount" for Bitcoins, I will spend them.  On the contrary, if it costs me the same, or more, to use Bitcoins, I will probably use a credit card for the benefits received (delayed payment and bonus bucks).

But if you leave them on Gox, use 2-factor authentication.   if it's a lot of money, get a yubi-key.  Or use Google Auth.

The interesting thing about the Work locking in the page of transactions is that somebody could try to perform work to un-do the work that was just done on block number "x".  Meanwhile all OTHER miners have moved on, and are working on block "x+1".
So while you MAY be able to attempt to un-do the work of block "x", it will be hard.  And so it's a race against the clock.  Once block "x+1" gets solved, the work needed to un-do block "x" is even harder, as now you have to prove that you have done more work than "x" and "x+1".  
So the further into the "confirmed" list it goes, the harder it is to un-do it.  And for a single miner, working against the difficulty level set because of the rest of the mining world, it's near impossible.  If you have a ton of resources (so that you were as big as the rest of the network of miners), it's possible (known as the 51% attack), but at that point, you may as well just make money as a super miner!

Actually, my assumption is that Bitcoin will evolve, but will retain many of the same key characteristics (like, if you own a bitcoin now and don't spend it, you'll still own a bitcoin in 2025), while evolving other characteristics (like, the ability to handle many more transactions).
Personally, I doubt that something else will take its place as the main crypto currency because of the momentum it has, and the rewards in place to keep it progressing.  Any advantages that came along through another crypto currency, threatening Bitcoin, would simply force change in Bitcoin.  There are billions of dollars of investment behind bitcoin now, and it's increasing by the tens of millions every month (VC's, vendor acceptance, small business investment, and mining equipment investment).  I think the momentum is too great for it to be displaced, and the reward system is in place to make sure that it doesn't.
But people disagree with me on that.  There are definitely assumptions, like you said!

It sounds like you are a vendor in this scenario (since you said "get the amount").  If you are selling goods, you would tell the buyer how many bitcoins to pay you.  It's up to you to determine the price, and many vendors use an exchange rate that's an average over the past 24 hours or something.
If you outsource it to Bitpay, you just tell them how many dollars you want, and bitpay accepts some amount of bitcoins, and you get however many dollars you asked for.  Of course, they'll give it to you in Bitcoins too, if you prefer.
If you aren't a vendor, and are just a casual user, you need to think of Bitcoins as just a separate currency.  If someone's paying you, tell them how many bitcoins they owe you (do the translation from dollars however you want).

I cringe at people leaving money on instawallet, and worrying about the security of Mt Gox.  Glad to see you rephrased the question.
Go to Mt Gox and look at funding options.  You can transfer bitcoins to Mt Gox - simply click on there, and they'll give you a bitcoin address.  Then copy that bitcoin address and "pay to it" on instawallet.
Not sure I'd agree that 2-factor on Mt Gox is "about as secure ans an actual bank", because a bank is typically insured.  If Mt Gox goes out of business, then you are S.O.L.  
I probably wouldn't go nuts on security for $300 (no sense in buying a $1000 safe to protect $300, for instance), but it's very simple to create a paper wallet on bitaddress.org, and transfer the bitcoins to the paper wallet, and then stick the paper wallet in a safe for a few years.    This is MUCH safer than Mt Gox - the biggest risk is whether you have a virus on your PC when you create the paper wallet.  The second biggest is whether Bitaddress is trustworthy software (and it has a good reputation).  Way less risk than leaving your money on Mt Gox.

You could fire up multibit, and get a receiving bitcoin address, and then pay yourself from Bitcoin-QT to multibit. (And pay the tiny fee to get it processed).
Just pay your entire balance to yourself, and verify the transaction before you delete any wallet files.
(Note, I haven't done this exact thing, but something similar many times.)

perhaps.  Or it might be just as fast to use the last hash result as the next nonce.  My point is that you can search in any order you'd like, not just sequentially.  Your point is equally valid - since you can search in any order, why not pick the fastest.
Presumably people who run pools will want their pooled miners to be running non-overlapping checks, so if you do sequential, you better not have everyone start at the same number.

Here are some stats that might help:
[Sourceforge]( shows that Bitcoin client software has been downloaded about 2M times since the beginning of time, and 180,000 times this year.  Given that a new release came out recently, I think that there are at least 180,000 reasonably active "users" of the client.  There's some overlap (people who have downloaded it multiple times), but that's just a 2-month window.
Mt. Gox has account numbers as high as 270,000 (maybe higher - this was seen on 2/16).  Assuming they are sequential, and about 65% of the Exchange market (which they are by volume), that's 415K people who have participated on exchanges.  (Clearly there is some overlap by people who participate on multiple exchanges, but it's a data point.)  My Mt. Gox account number is around 11,000, and I registered in June 2011.
Coinbase allows "off-exchange" purchases, as do a lot of other services (BitInstant).
[Google Trends]( can help correlate popularity:  Mt. Gox appears to be about 3 times Blockchain, which historically looks about 3 times coinbase+instawallet (although Coinbase is going nuts more recently).
Blockchain shows about 130K wallets, and Gox's account numbers are in the 270K range.  How much overlap, who knows.
Alexa and Quantcast can be used to determine site popularity, which could translate to number of users, to try to tie all these numbers together.
Just looking at last 90 days, you have 200K Sourceforge downloads of the client, 80K new wallets on Blockchain.info, probably 50K new users at Coinbase (picking a number out of the air based on site stats), and 200K new users to all exchanges combined.  That puts you over 500K (last 90 day new accounts), and that hasn't touched instawallet, paper wallets, bitcoins bought on behalf of friends, etc.
So I think it's well over 500K (since it's 500K in the last 90 days), and probably closer to double that - actually over a million, but probably not over 2M.

I have had some issues with Coinbase.  I think they are *really close* to having a valuable service.  But they are also blowing a huge opportunity.
I have supported them publicly, because they don't need bashing.  And in general, the "Bitcoin community" (gawd, I hate that term) is very forgiving of honest people who are trying their best.
But there are just a few issues that are going to put this company out of business.  And they are STUPID and EASILY OVERCOME!
1) COMMUNICATE.  If someone sends you a support request, REPLY.  HIRE fricking KELLY SERVICES if you need to, just to make sure that EVERY communication is responded to.  For fuck's sake!
2)  Live up to your agreements, and be honest, above-board, and transparent at all times.  This is Business 101.
I actually have screen shots of me requesting to send bitcoins, and them executing the transaction twice (and it appears in the Blockchain twice).  Had I been paying someone else, instead of myself, I would have been PISSED.
I reported it, but got ZERO reply.  I was polite, because it's just a small bug in their software which could have major ramifications, but holy fuck.  I was paying me, so no biggie.  hell, it even took my balance negative.
So now I'm going to wait until all my deposits clear, and then do one withdraw, and if they pay me twice, it'll be their loss at that point.  
I tried to report it!  They didn't respond.   They are wasting sooooo much karma.

If I had $18 M in Bitcoins (70,000 BTC) and were evil, but I believed in the long term future of the currency, periodically I would induce panic.  Simple steps:
First, pick some time when market euphoria is great - so wait until there's a really nice run up.  Then plan how far you think you can get the market to drop. 
1.  Dump 70,000 BTC on to the market.    
2.  Hammer ALL Major Bitcoin sites with a DDOS attack.    
3.  put in some buy orders near the estimated bottom.   Might be 50%, might be more.    
4.  watch the panic.    
5.  Buy BTC on sale.    
6.  Expect several iterations of the rubber band effect, where it rises a little and then falls.  Use each mini-peak and valley to increase holdings.    
End of the day, you have 75,000 BTC.
Wait a few weeks / months and repeat.

Indeed.  Someone with a good (or evil) plan and a big checkbook could easily blow away either.
I was just thinking the other day, reviewing some stats:  Someone who bought an Avalon Batch 3 could have paid about 100 BTC, and received (in August) a machine that was approximately 1/3000th of the network power.  So at that point, for 300,000 BTC you could have an equivalent, parallel network - roughly $30M.  This month it might be $50M (at list price).
Imagine if Intel, Google, and Amazon decided to partner to build a competing currency.  Three partnering companies could lock up the manufacturing, distribution, and vendor support of a whole new currency that could smoke bitcoin and litecoin.  Of course, it'd have to be better in some way.  But $50M (inflated list price) is not outside the realm of three big companies.  
The window is certainly closing though for companies (not for governments, though).

I realize that's how CONFIRMED transactions work.  My question is that when you are trying to verify that the funds exist in a Bitcoin Address that is used as an input in an unconfirmed transaction (to see if it's valid).
If the money existed in block 101 (as an output of a transaction), and then was attempted to be spent in block 151, how can you tell if the money is still in that Bitcoin address, unless you look at ALL of the intermediary blocks (to see if it was spent elsewhere)?

What happens in the typical weekly sell-off is that people sell like crazy, and a gap grows between the bid (what people are willing to pay) and the ask (what people are willing to sell for).   
So, with mass hysteria, the price drops, as the bid orders get eaten up at a rapid rate.  You see the crash, and jump on the bandwagon, selling AFTER you saw the decline.  Note that if you tried to buy back immediately, the "steady hands" haven't lowered their asking price.  
You MAY be able to buy back from someone who jumps on the hysteria bandwagon after you, but people in panic typically don't do that.  So the steady hands are buying up the dropping Bitcoins.  And then it hits bottom.
Now, the steady hands still have their asking price up where it started.  And the price begins to rise.  But you just sold.  You think it's going to fall some more.  So you wait to see if the rise is for real.  And by the time you decide, yes, it's for real, you are buying back at a price above what you sold for.

I have a personal belief that the street, town, city or country that becomes Bitcoin-friendly will create a boom for their economy.  Sort of like the Silicon Valley of Bitcoin.
One suburb outside Berlin is getting the reputation for acceptance.
It would be very interesting to create and measure a Bitcoin-Zone and see what the impact to the local economy is.  For a dissertation, it might be practical to look at specific companies that started accepting Bitcoin, and see how it affected their bottom line.  Or, if practical, try to organize a Bitcoin-Zone in some small town, or on a street of some large town, and measure the impact, testing the theory that accepting Bitcoin is a boon to the economy.

If they take the money and run, yes.  If they say "look, we can't do what we set out to do.  You paid us in good faith to do something, and we are returning your money."  no.
If they say "When you placed your order, you knew that there was a risk, and we executed to the best of our ability, and spent 45% of the money in our quest to deliver a product, and we failed.  All we have left to return is the 55%.  Take it or leave it."  um, then, I guess it's a Maybe.  Depends on under what terms they accepted the original orders.
And the 4th alternative:  "We are going out of business."  In the US, a bankruptcy is a completely legit way of winding down a company.  And the people with orders would have claims against the entity as it wound down affairs.  I wouldn't call them scammers, but it's not someone that I would like to do business with in the future.   But the premise of every business transaction in the US is that it's done with the risk that the other party may file bankruptcy, and then you become a claimant in the proceedings.

One issue:  Anytime you have a bunch of fields and you allow the user to change one, and auto-calculate the rest, you need to figure out which variable you are going to solve for.
You could adjust all fields, based on the new information.  that seems wrong and would frustrate the user.
You could keep track of which fields the user changed most recently, and don't calculate those.
You could put lock icons on each field, and only change the unlocked field that was changed longest ago.  (But then you run into the same issue if the user tries to lock all but one field - and then changes the unlocked field... which one do you unlock?  Maybe you blink all the locked fields then).
You could have a little marker by one field that shows which one is going to change if you change another one.
You could have "defaults" (hopefully smart defaults) to change the most logical field.  For instance, always solve for the Gross, unless Gross is what they changed, in which case solve for Net.
See what I mean?   It's a slightly more complicated User Interface issue, that no one has solved very well in any application, as far as I have seen.

Yeah, the old blockchain will rapidly be overturned by every client in the network (because of the rules of Bitcoin, the longer/more complex chain is determined to be the valid one).  And many of the "spends" will be invalid, because any recently mined coins no longer belong to the Address that owned them before - they belong to the CIA.   
And then any mined blocks after that will reinforce the new chain.
There are no real good recoveries from that scenario.   Some people will cry that they lost money.  Others will see that they are ahead, because certain spends will be reversed.  And there will be no consensus as to what is the *right* blockchain, because the rules of Bitcoin clearly state that the CIA chain would be the "right" one.

In the long run, mining will tend to be very close to break-even.  So if you want an estimate of how much the costs of electricity are for the network, a reasonable estimate of hourly costs would be:
Current-BTC-Price x Average-Block-Reward-including-fees x 6.
So $75/BTC x 26 BTC x 6 Blocks per hour.     
or $11.7K per hour.
Since the price has jumped up so much, this is probably way high, but it gives you a starting point.
(Also factor in the fact that miners need to cover their time and their capital costs, not just their electricity.)

[Here is a chart of the planned distribution of Bitcoins.](
If you look at that chart, you can see that the first four years is a straight line, up and to the right.  If there was no halving, then production of bitcoins would follow that line forever.  In other words, it wouldn't be a limited supply.
I believe Satoshi wanted to make sure there would be a limited supply (he picked an arbitrary number of 21 million), because that would allow bitcoins to hold their value better.  The graph shows a "rounded off" curve that is intended to mimic the mining of precious metals.   If you look at gold mining, it was very easy initially to mine for gold, but as time goes on, it becomes more difficult, and less and less is extracted (making the easily-mined gold hold its value).
Compare this to sand.  One reason sand is not worth much is because it's a virtually unlimited supply, and it's simple to go get some.  I still will pay to get sand for my kids sandbox, but I'm paying essentially for the cost to extract it and ship it; there's no extra "imputed value" due to rarity.
Since bitcoins are basically a ledger entry, and there's virtually no cost to maintaining a ledger entry, scarcity was important.  
Some economists think that an annual inflation rate of 2% or 3% is healthy, and the people who manage the dollar supply keep printing money to try to aim for that.  If you look at the chart, the planned 2013 inflation rate for bitcoins was about 14%, taking the number of bitcoins from about 10.5M to 12M.  
By about 2020, the bitcoin inflation rate will likely be in that 2-3% range.  And Satoshi could have decided to just let it grow at that rate indefinitely (emulating fiat currencies) but instead he chose to limit production to 21 Million (emulating precious metals, which have a finite limit).  
More information than what you asked for:
This hits on the question: which is better, fiat currency (backed by nothing), where governments can manipulate the supply in an effort to smooth out the bubbles and reduce the panic, or gold-backed currencies, where the supply is limited, and very much subject to supply and demand fluctuations and mob-mentality (bubbles and panic)?
Dollars used to be backed by metals.  [A dollar bill was literally an IOU for a fixed amount of Gold or Silver.](  You could go to a bank and say "here's my dollar, give me the ounces of metal that you owe me".  
Somewhere along the line, some genius (/ crook?) figured out that you can print more IOUs than you actually have gold or silver to back it up.  As long as all the people didn't come for their metals at the same time ("bank run"), you were fine.  This is known as "fractional reserve" banking, because you have a fraction (less than 100%) of the amount on reserve as you need to, to back all of your IOUs.
Imagine a small town in the 1800's.  A banker would set up a vault and tell people "store your gold in my vault, and I'll give you an IOU", and then the people of the town pass the IOUs back and forth as money.  A certain amount of IOUs would get permanently lost or destroyed every year, and so the banker could probably get away with printing a few IOUs for himself, and buying a nice suit or gun or food.  Or he could lend them out to people, and requiring the borrower to pay interest.  If you did a little of that, no one would notice, due to the destroyed IOUs, and the fact that no one is auditing your vault contents vs. the number of IOUs floating around.
But when you do that, you inject some risk into the system, because some people won't pay the loans back, and there's a chance of a bank run that you can't satisfy.
So now, the US government sets a minimum on how much reserve banks must hold, and then guarantees bank deposits (it's a very small minimum, like 10%).  It's a very dangerous game, because the guarantee basically says that your deposit is safe (even though 90% of it has been lent out), but since the US Government can "print more money", they can guarantee it.)  But what would happen if the government printed all the money that people think they have, to live up to the guarantee?  yes, you'd get your $1000 back, but it would only be able to buy one loaf of bread.   No one wants that!
So, it's all a very complex argument, and the Bitcoin experiment will probably shed some light onto whether a currency can survive long term if it has a fixed limit (like gold does).  
Gold and Silver worked very well as a currencies for a very long time.  They had issues (like, they were hard to store and transmit, they were easily counterfeited, etc).  Many of those issues are fixed with Bitcoin.
The US Mint printed Silver coins for years, and crooks would shave the edges and collect the silver shavings.  That's why quarters and dimes have ridges on the edges; a historical artifact from when coins were silver and the ridges would help identify shaved coins.
Also, when coins were really 100% silver, a Quarter would be 2.5x the weight of a dime, so that they would be proportional.  That's why a Quarter is bigger than a dime.  But what is a nickel (the US 5-cent piece, which is larger than a dime)?  
Well a 5-cent silver piece would be half the size and weight of a dime.  But "nickel" is actually another metal, it's not silver!  And it seems silly for a country to declare that a bigger metal 5-cent piece made of nickel is worth *exactly* half of a smaller 10-cent piece made of silver (because then you've just set up an arbitrage opportunity).  But some nickel miner probably bribed a government official into doing that!
So basically, the history of money has a lot of crooks involved in the manufacturing and storage - primarily bankers and governments.  (I'm not saying that all bankers and government officials are crooks.)
Bitcoin removes the temptation to commit a lot of those crooked deeds.   And then you can see all the other crooked deeds, like bitcoin thefts, Paypal chargebacks, etc.  Crooks are EVERYWHERE when it comes to money.

The single best way to encourage adoption is to reward the early adopters by spending your bitcoin.  Sure, it might cost you a little bit in replacement of Bitcoins, but it'll be well worth it.
All it took was one "casino" to say "I made a half million in profits in six months" for a bunch to come out of the woodwork.

Yes, if you are trying to move the coins to your wallet, then that would work.  I thought you were trying to move them to a PAPER wallet, and then make sure that they got moved.
My point was that if you were trying to keep them secure in a paper wallet, then you are defeating the purpose by importing the private key.
And if you are simply trying to move them to your online wallet, then why use the paper wallet at all?  Your wallet client will have a Bitcoin Address to receive coins, so you can simply skip steps 1,2,3, and 5, and just execute step 4, paying your client's wallet.   Your client will have the private key for the bitcoin address that it shows you, and you typically do not need to know it, if you protect your wallet.
(Typical wallets hold many addresses, and for each address, there will be 3 numbers - your Bitcoin Address, your Public Key, and your Private Key.  Wallets are supposed to keep you from having to know all that.)
Does that help?

Start with the current price of Bitcoin ($76), and a bank account of some amount ($500?).  Decide if you want to buy some at 76 - and how many.
Take a deck of cards, and flip the top card.  If it's red, it counts as a price drop.  If it's black, it counts as a price increase.  Use the number to figure out how much, 1 to 13 points.  Then decide if you want to buy more or sell.
Remember to factor in a 0.6% transaction fee for each buy and sell.
Pretty soon, you'll figure out that it's not as easy as it looks.  And there are better ways to make money than gambling.

Log scale is the appropriate way to look at a compounding financial graph.  
The point I would make with something like this graph is that the long-term price trend is increasing on a trend line of about 15% per month.  Even though we've been through a cycle of hype, and exceeded that for a brief period, the overall trend is very positive.
I think a better graph is [how much of the world's wealth is tied up in bitcoins]( and that is increasing at about 18.7% per month.  And you can see the cycles of hype and bubble-deflation. (This trend indicates that we're still in a period of bubble-deflation, if previous hype-cycles are any indication, but that the long-term outlook is very strong.)
No one knows what will happen in the future - the past can't predict it.  But overall, the long-range trend-lines are very positive.
(The reason why log-scale is appropriate on compounding items is that you can filter out the compounding effect as a straight line rate.  You would expect that "network effect" and "amount of wealth stored in X" would follow some sort of long-term compounding trend line.  Look at facebook acceptance, email implementations, fax machine, automobile, internet, etc.)

Ah. I was trying to provide you with a way to generate blackhole addresses on an ongoing basis.  If you want ONE blackhole address, the best one to use is all zeros (which, since zero isn't valid in Bitcoin Addresses, is basically all 1's, plus the checksum).

You may also want to read up on "contracts" on the bitcoin wiki.  There is a way to do what you are trying to do within the bitcoin protocol.  [see example 5](

I believe in the long run, a more efficient method to secure the network will be found, and Bitcoin will move to it (or be replaced by a coin that is more efficient).  
If you think about all the resources being put against the double-spend protection, if those resources were directed toward other important things (because the double-spend issue was solved more efficiently), then Bitcoin would be much better.
For instance, what if those resources were put against:
-  More widespread vendor acceptance.    
-  Smaller, more efficient database on the client.    
-  More rapid confirmations.
Clearly "security against the double-spend" is a very important function.  But if it can be performed more efficiently, then there are other problems that could be solved with the resources being currently spent on that.
Slightly far-fetched example:  Imagine if the block reward went to the person who got the most vendors signed up to accept bitcoin, as measured by the amount of transactions that the vendor accepts in Bitcoins....

Yes, there is a way for you (or a hacker) to find out what your private key is.  That's why, if you are running a full Bitcoin client (like Bitcoin-QT), you should encrypt your wallet, and protect it (back it up regularly).
For a substantial amount of money, consider "cold storage" - go to bitaddress.org, and print a paper wallet.  Then pay the Bitcoin Address on that paper, and store copies of the paper somewhere safe.  If done properly, then your private key never was stored on your machine, and it's safe.  
To use bitaddress.org properly, use a PC that has no viruses.  Open a [private browsing window]( navigate to bitaddress.org.  If you are super-paranoid, you can even unplug from the internet at this point (and turn off your wireless), because everything from here is local to your machine.  Create a paper wallet, print it, then reboot your PC (which will make sure that Private Address is not stored somewhere on your PC).
At this point, you'll have a Bitcoin Address that you can pay, and monitor online (BlockChain.info allows you to "watch" accounts), and no one can touch without the piece of paper.

A)  You eliminate a giant section of potential spies, and reduce them to be **only** those in physical proximity to you who happen to be able to decrypt encrypted Wi-Fi traffic (and other people on the other end of the VPN).

I suspect that the net effect of this will be that people (including analysts) will ease into Bitcoin with small portions of their portfolio - say a tenth of a percent of your portfolio into Bitcoin, just as a "lottery ticket".
And this will continue to push the price higher.   As the price goes higher and as time goes by (and as people understand Bitcoin better, and as more merchants accept it, and as hardware wallets help to make them more secure), then analysts will be more willing to recommend it, maybe to 1% of the portfolio.
Ultimately, there will be a tremendous transfer of wealth into Bitcoin over the next five years, with people only cashing out as Bitcoins dominate their portfolio and they want to diversify (or buy cool toys).

The people who can identify you are the end points to whom you identify yourself.  For example, if you identify yourself when you buy bitcoins, and you identify yourself when you spend them (by putting in a "ship to" address), then those end points know exactly who you are, and they can see the trail of those bitcoins between those two end points.  
Generally, you wouldn't expect the two end points to collaborate, although with Prism and other government programs, there may be an information aggregator who has information about both end points.
Also, generally people are aware that the end points have the information.  There's no surprise there.
Where it gets tricky is when there are paths off of that straight-line buy and spend.  That's where you may get the FALSE illusion of anonymity.  For example, you buy bitcoins (and ID yourself), and then you transfer some to another address.  It's a reasonable assumption that you've just introduced reasonable doubt as to the ownership of those bitcoins.   Then you spend those anonymously on SilkRoad or something.  Your change is returned to you.  Again, it's reasonable to think that the change can't be traced to you.  Then say you spend the change, along with some other coins that were on that original "easily identifiable" straight-line path.  Now the "reasonable doubt" pretty much goes away, and you are linked to the SilkRoad transaction.
Again, this probably isn't a huge deal, and there are ways to avoid it.  But it reminds me of [the old AOL and Netflix release of anonymous data]( a few years back, where, within 24 hours, some lady was identified.  Another (gay) guy was "outed".  etc.

There is a 1MB limit currently on the block size, in the current design.  If the transactions exceed the maximum block size, the extras will just queue up as unconfirmed.  Miners get to choose which transactions they confirm.
This is recognized as a limitation, but in the design on purpose, and can be removed if it becomes an issue.  I can't speak for the developers, but I think the idea is to implement other space-saving techniques before raising this limit, but I haven't been following the discussion.

Solo mining usually has a slightly higher "expected return", since you don't incur the cost of the pool operator.
Pooled mining will almost certainly have a more consistent return.
The question is, do you feel lucky?
Let's say you can average 0.1 Bitcoins per day mining with your machine.  That's about 25 bitcoins in 250 days.  Would you rather see that amount trickle in every day, or wait for an average of about 125 days (might be tomorrow, or it might be a year from now), for you to solve a block and get 25 Bitcoins?
The benefit of pooled mining is that you don't need to wait very long to find out if you are doing it right!  And it's more deterministic.  Not so heavily based on luck.
So, I HIGHLY recommend pooled mining.

Here is the link to the report, so you can confirm it yourself (or choose to not believe the person who reported it):
This was from a year ago.  
It says that at the time of block 165,643 (i.e. Feb 6, 2012), there were 40,631 accounts with exactly 50BTC.  In other words, there were 165,643 events where ~50 BTC were issued, and there are 40,631 accounts that currently (at the time) had exactly 50 in them.
Not saying there's a 1-to-1 correspondence, because some people could just stash 50 BTC after buying them on an exchange.  Similarly, sometimes fees would change the issuance amount, so it wasn't exactly 165,643 issuances of exactly 50.
But on that day, 24.5% of all bitcoins mined were held in accounts with exactly 50 BTC in them.  That's 2 Million coins!

You are talking about the exchange rate and the nearly universal acceptance of the dollar, both of which are impressive (especially when compared to something like frequent flyer miles or bitcoin). 
But being "backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government" is like me taking out a loan from the bank and, when they ask for collateral, saying "it's backed by the full faith and credit of me" (and I'm an upstanding guy, and have never failed to repay a debt, honestly, so it's not a bad thing.)
That's not collateral.  That's not backing.  And no bank would lend UNLIMITED funds based on that statement.

Same concept, but the wall at $50 is an ASK wall, not a bid wall. 
A bid wall is beneath the market price (providing support), while an ask wall is above the current going rate (providing resistance on upward movement).
In order for the price to get above $50, like say to $50.05, about 13,000 Bitcoins need to be purchased - approximately $650,000 worth.
But then the price can fluctuate freely (up and down) between other walls.

Just run the exact scenario that I described by your tax guy, and see what he says about art and tickets (and barter in general), and I bet he'll confirm.  
Just like anything you claim (like charitable deductions, mileage for your company car, etc.), your records carry a lot of weight.  It's not "how can the IRS prove what I paid", it's simply a matter of you sharing your records, and if you keep reasonable records, then you'll be fine.  If you try to create them the night before an audit, then not so much!

I really don't know anything special about September.  I just know that the average "hype cycle" of Bitcoin (based on the last 4 cycles) is about 65 days on an uptrend (wiggling upward), hit a peak, and 158 days on a downtrend (oscillating downward to a trough), for about a 7.4 month cycle.  158 days after the April 10 peak is late September. 
This analysis is all based on market cap - how much wealth is invested in Bitcoins.  And if you try to estimate the "rock bottom" price for mid/late September, it works out to be somewhere around $50, based on the past trends, and the expected coin production.
But one thing I can predict with certainty is that no one can accurately predict what will happen, especially not me.

You are correct with the way the code is written now, since a satoshi is the smallest unit.  But the source code shows that the block reward gets cut in half every four years (it never stops getting cut, the way it's written now).  
Right now the maximum divisibility of Bitcoins is to 8 decimal places, but there has already been speculation that by 2140, this will be extended.  In which case, there may still be more bitcoins created after 2140.  But even if there are, the total never exceeds 21 Million.

Thanks for the suggestion.  I was thinking about adding that feature, so that if the URL contains multiple addresses, it would look them all up.
There are at least two services that I have seen that do basically what you are asking, although not quite as simply as what btcbal does.
I have a wallet on blockchain.info, where I watch a number of Bitcoin Addresses, and that works well for what you are describing.  It just takes several clicks to log in and get there.  I forget the name of the other service that does something similar.
I think the immediate change that I need to make to btcbal is to eliminate the automatic lookup as you start typing into the input field.  It currently breaks the blockchain.info API recommendations for hitting their server too often in a short period.  And now they seem to be blocking IP addresses that do that.  (so right now, if you begin typing your IP address into the field on btcbal.com, it might not return a balance).
This IP address blocking will also be an issue with the feature that you request, especially for lots of bitcoin addresses.  I could probably look up 2-4, but 5 or more would have to have a built-in delay.

You are waaaaay off.
The reason is because the Bitcoin Address is a hash of the public key, and therefore is substantially shorter than 256 bits:  160 bits of meaningful information.
That means that on average, there are 2^96 collisions on each Bitcoin Address (i.e. A LOT), and on average you'd have to try only 2^159 tries (i.e. half of 2^160 ) before you found one.  
Better get started!

This statement is really wrong:  


You really need to think of Bitcoin as a giant shared ledger (spreadsheet) of account numbers with balances.  The name "coin" is misleading.  So one account has 3.78234 in it, and they pay out .0234 and so it's just subtracted from the account balance.  No biggie.
The prime number / cryptography stuff is used to sign transactions, prove that you are the account owner, and lock in the transactions.
@_date: 2013-03-23 20:31:00
Attention:  THIS IS THE WORST NEWBIE MISTAKE:
You're sitting on a bunch of Bitcoins, and you decide you want to put in a "stop loss" order... that is, something like this:  "OK, the market price is $65.  I want to make sure I get at least $55 for my Bitcoins, so that if it ever drops to $55, I'll sell my 2000 bitcoins."  So you put in a Sell order at $55.
This will IMMEDIATELY start selling at $65, then $64, then $63.... until either you eat up all the bids down to  $55, or you run out of bitcoins, and sell every one.
That happened yesterday.
--- 
Second worst mistake is to react (sell) when you see someone make mistake   If someone makes that mistake, you should be buying, not selling!
Unfortunately, there isn't enough cash in the exchanges at the present time to take advantage of this buying opportunity, or the price would have bounced right back up.  So as soon as people get their cash moved, it'll be bouncing up.  
What I am trying to say to the noobs is:  please panic sell, because I can't buy until tomorrow.

I saw an American Express commercial advertising 2FA last night on TV.  Of course they called it "cell phone confirmation" or something a little more user friendly.
But you're right - the general population doesn't get this yet.
@_date: 2013-06-25 17:53:21
Yes, there is a way.
Look at the table at the bottom of [this page]( beneath the charts.  That data is all from the API.
To calculate an exchange rate, you need to know whether the person is selling or buying (left or right sides, respectively), and then how many Bitcoins (say X bitcoins). 
Zip down the table, until you get to the LARGEST number in the 3rd column (BTC) that is still less than or equal to X.  Say that number is Y, and Y&lt;=X.
So you know the first Y bitcoins will cost whatever number is in the 4th column (under USD).  And the remaining (X-Y) bitcoins will cost the number in the first column of the next row.
The same procedure can be followed if you are given a USD figure, and you are trying to see how many Bitcoins can be purchased.
Note that this table has some precision cut off for simplification, but if you created an actual Bid/Ask table with the real bids (with 8 decimal places), it would work exactly this way.  It'd just be a longer table.  And the API allows you to do that.
@_date: 2013-02-14 09:58:32
The challenge with Bitcoin is, do you have a stash of dollars sitting there ready to pounce on those buying opportunities, or would you rather have all your dollars invested in Bitcoins and not on the sidelines?
It takes soo damn long to get cash from my broker to my bank to dwolla to mt gox (or whatever), and I miss those opportunities.  But do I want to have a bunch of cash (US Dollars) sitting in Mt Gox, waiting for something like that?
@_date: 2013-06-17 17:32:58
Let me try to clarify my example:
You buy Bitcoins at Mt. Gox.  You transfer them to your Bitcoin Address. NSA sees that.  Anyone can see that those Bitcoins are still in that address.  NSA can see that your name and passport photo are associated with that bitcoin address.
They knock on your door and demand for you to produce your password. You produce a fake wallet password, which clearly does not have that Bitcoin Address in it.  So they demand again.
And your plausible deniability would be to explain what?  That someone else hacked your Mt. Gox account or passport and transferred those coins away from you, but you never reported it to anyone?

Do the math.
If a million small businesses use Bitcoins for the suppliers and from their customers, how much do they need on hand to handle their monthly business cycle?  My ten-person company needs $60K on hand for monthly cash flow - that's the difference between our "poorest" monthly day (payday) and our richest monthly day (usually right before payday).  
But let's say on average they need $10K worth of Bitcoins.  1 million businesses, times $10K = $10B.  If there's only 21 Million Bitcoins, how much is each one worth?  at least $476.  
Now add on 100 Million consumers who want to have pocket change on average of $100.  There's another $10B.  so that doubles the *minimum* value of a Bitcoin.

To be sure, you pay 11 BTC somewhere else.
I don't really think you would want to import a key known by someone else into a wallet with money in it.  A  better solution would be to back up your wallet before you start, write down a bitcoin address from your wallet, exit Bitcoin-qt, rename your wallet file, and then when you start bitcoin-qt, you'll get a fresh, empty wallet file.  Then import the new address, and pay yourself the 1 btc, by paying the address that you wrote down.
Once that transaction is confirmed as sent, exit bitcoin-qt, rename the empty wallet to something else, and put your full wallet back in place.  When you start bitcoin-qt you'll see the moved coin, along with the original balance.
Not easy, but do-able.

With Dwolla &lt;-&gt; Gox, it was 2 weeks initial set up time, 3-5 days transfer time.  I got ten days of Bitinstant transfers in before I could get ONE Dwolla transfer in, which made a HUGE difference when the price was on a steady incline.

That was actually pretty good.  As an American, I can tell you my close friends would get lost with the international names and "pfennigs".
But I still go back to the basics.  **Bitcoin is a payment system that allows nearly fee-free payments** that can't bounce (unlike checks, credit cards, and paypal).  It's good for merchants because they can cut down on fraud for internet purchases.  It's good for buyers because they can/should get a "cash discount", or lower priced goods because there isn't a middle man (visa/mc/bank/paypal).

I encourage you to look into it, but by all means, do NOT buy any just because I did.  This is one of the riskiest things you can buy."

You got some push back, because of Bitcoin's volatility, which is true.  It's been all over the place.
The thing is it's still very early in the game.  I [created a chart]( that shows Bitcoin's 30-day volatility, as measured simply by dividing the high price by the low price over the previous 30 days.
What I expect to see is that the volatility highs on this chart will keep getting smaller and smaller.
The day that shows the highest 30-day volatility was around 4/10, when we hit a high that was about 9-times as high as the low for the previous 30 days.
Even 2x in 30 days is a lot of volatility (think about a 30-day period with a low of 60 and a high of 120).
But as time goes by, and as the price rises, and as Bitcoin gets into the hands of people who don't have their life's fortune at stake, the volatility will calm down.  In the next year, we'll probably never spike over 5x for a 30-day period (think 150 to 750 in 30 days.  That would be a lot!)
The year after that, I doubt we'll ever see a spike of 3x.

You are waaaaaaay off.  Like off by a factor of 2^96, which is very far off.
"All" you really need to do to spend money is to be able to provide a public key that hashes to the 160-bits of the checksum.  Still a near-impossible task, but not as much impossible as 256 bits.  
It's not as if you are trying to find the ONE combination of 256 bits that works.  There are actually approximately 2^96 combinations of 256 bits that will work, for each Bitcoin Address, and you are trying to find one of those 2^96 possibilities.
(I know this is a technicality, and your general theme was that it's near impossible.  And in that, you were correct!)

You totally misunderstood my claim.  My claim is not that you can become wealthy, but that you can successfully protect your wealth, through becoming educated.  (Remember, we were talking about wealth storage, not wealth accumulation.  Not sure how you jumped off topic!)
In the traditional banking system, in order to protect your wealth unconditionally, you had to gain power and wealth.  You can't just stick your money in a [Cyprus] bank and assume that it's safe.  However, if you are "too big to fail", you have protected your wealth.  If you can afford to buy politicians or pay for lots of protection, you can protect your wealth.  If you can buy a huge vault and armed guards, you can protect your wealth.
The price to protect wealth with Bitcoin is knowledge, not wealth.  If you can figure out how to create a secure brain wallet (which is not all that difficult), you can protect .01 Bitcoins or 111,111 Bitcoins.
Thanks for congratulating me for being in the top 1% or maybe 1 in a thousand.  So how many large bankers are there in the traditional banking environment?  Do you think 1 in 100 people can protect their traditional wealth unconditionally?  I doubt it.  Seems like MUCH less than 1 in 1000.  And yet PEOPLE TRUST those .1% of bankers and politicians to protect their wealth (because the vast majority of people are NOT the .1%)


You make a great case for Bitcoin with that statement, because so far, governments have demonstrated much more success in blocking fiat transactions than Bitcoin transactions.  Not that they couldn't destroy Bitcoin with appropriate attacks, but that they ALREADY have blocked numerous fiat transactions, confiscated fiat accounts, destroyed fiat wealth through money printing, and got in the way of people trying to spend their money.
Again, I'm not saying that Bitcoin is perfect.  I am saying that there are major differences between Bitcoin and fiat, and some differences actually favor Bitcoin.  Your original question was "how's that different?"  That's what I answered.

You go to bitinstant.com and follow the instructions.  Basically, the way you do it is to "MoneyGram" your $20 (plus fees) to a processor, who turns it into Bitcoins.
Walmart and CVS are only involved because they offer MoneyGram services (they don't know anything about Bitcoins... you need to talk in their language, which is "I need to send some money to someone" or "I need to pay a bill using MoneyGram").  
It's all on the BitInstant website.  I have done it at WalMart (at the customer service counter... fill out a blue MoneyGram form.  I hear that CVS is sometimes a bigger pain because they point you to the "red phone" or something.

Profitability of mining is a self-correcting system. 
First, realize that the block reward (currently 25 Bitcoins per block) is just part of the reward.  Transaction fees make up the other part.  So, as time goes on, you can expect fees to make up a greater portion of the reward.
It has become unprofitable for some miners already, and they have quit mining (with CPUs, and lately GPUs).  Not a problem:  the strength of the network has increased throughout this transition.
Ultimately, it may reach an equilibrium where it's minimally profitable (where it gets to the point where many people say "why go through the hassle of mining?")  At that point, miners will be making "a fair wage", so to speak, where it's barely worth the effort.  Some will quit (those who think their time and efforts are worth more), while others join in, who think it's worth the time and effort.
But it's unlikely that "all miners quit completely" (or even a majority of miners quit at once), because each time a miner quits, it becomes slightly more profitable for the remaining miners (or for someone else to join).

Here's one more number to toss into the mix:     
[80095 total members]( of the "most official" bitcoin forum.  This is the number of people who have (or historically had) enough interest (pro or con) in bitcoin to be motivated to register.
I would think that the nearly 17,000 people who are registered for this subreddit are probably almost entirely a subset of bitcointalk.org. 
This is totally non-scientific, but using this number from my personal experience, I have registered twice on that forum.  But I **personally** can quickly count 9 people (not counting me) who are bitcoin users or holders, who I'm 99.9% certain have gone nowhere near that forum (or certainly not registered).  So 2 registered forum users account for 10 real Bitcoin Users.
I wouldn't be surprised if only one tenth of Bitcoin users would register for that forum, and I'd expect that fraction to decrease over time.  Given my personal experience, I can derive an estimate of the number of users by multiplying the forum count by 5.
So this gives a "personal experience" estimate of 400K, but a belief that the usage is at least 800K.

I've had several issues with Coinbase, and reported each to their customer support.  Here are my results:
1)  "High Risk" transaction cancelled.  They were responsive and reversed it.  Good job!    
2)  One Bitcoin Withdraw (transfer to a Bitcoin Address) happened twice and was posted twice.  THIS IS A MAJOR ERROR in my mind, in that if I was paying someone else, they just created an irreversible transaction to whomever I was paying.  And there is NO WAY they can correct this.
In my book, the *correct* solution for Coinbase on issue  would be to reimburse me the funds that they screwed up on, if I was unable to get it back from the person that I double-paid.   But it's over $500 worth of transfer.  And I was paying myself.  So there's no real loss here.  But they didn't even ASK or OFFER to reimburse me.
But the real tragedy here is that Coinbase couldn't respond to a problem report for several DAYS.  They took my account balance negative, double-posted a withdraw request, and had nothing to say about it.
Today, I received a note that basically said "it's all fixed" (which is silly, because they have NO IDEA that it's all fixed, unless they reimbursed me the Bitcoins).
I am a big supporter of Coinbase, because they are trying to do something that is breakthrough.  But they are seriously going through some tough times, and I don't want to sugar-coat it.
Hopefully in six months, they will be hardened and flawless.

You aren't understanding my pretzel logic!  :)  Bitcoin users WERE affected by the drop of bitcoin value from 31 to 28.
In the headline, there is no proven (or even stated) causal relationship between the 3 statements.  Just three events that happened coincidental to each other.  And the 3rd statement was patently FALSE.  It was inaccurate.  The British pound "tanked" (or more accurately dipped slightly), while Bitcoin holders WERE affected (if anything "tanked" it was Bitcoins).  All three events happened near the same time, but no one (especially not me) is saying that these three events are causal whatsoever.

I have never done a wire transfer to Mt Gox.  I assumed a Wire would be $40 or so (a charge assessed by the bank).    
This is USA info, by the way:
The Dwolla setup takes a long time, but the transfer is done via ACH ("Automated" Clearing House), so they can "reach into your bank account" and grab the money.  It usually takes three business days to clear, plus you may need to prove yourself to Dwolla, which are both negatives as compared to direct Wire. 
But the cost is $0.25, as opposed to $40 (= my estimate.   You may get free wires depending on your relationship with the bank.  Or you might pay more.)
Once you authenticate to both Dwolla and Mt Gox (which can take at least a week), then transfers go pretty smoothly (with about a 3-4 day turnaround). 
I am moving about $2K a day into BTC, so I just queue up one, and process the one from last week.  Then repeat daily.

If you get cornered on mining, the answer should be something like this:
"There's a powerful network of independently owned computers that is far more powerful than than the largest super computer.  These computers are providing a critical bookkeeping function, making sure that the money is on account, when a user wants to spend it.  And they get paid in Bitcoin for providing that service.  
"This also happens to be the way that bitcoins are initially being distributed:  A clever way to distribute the currency by rewarding those that make it a very solid, reliable currency."

@_date: 2013-05-07 12:26:39
OK. let me give it a try.
Intro to Bitcoin first:    
Bitcoin has a giant ledger that keeps track of which accounts have money in them.  It's like a giant shared banking system.  I think this is pretty easy to understand, if you visualize it as a spreadsheet, where each column represents a different account (bitcoin address), and you can easily see which columns have money in them.
Then a transaction (a row in the spreadsheet) is simply moving money from one account to another.
The biggest challenge that Bitcoin's clever design overcame is the challenge of the double-spend.  Since the ledger is shared among people in a peer-to-peer network, different users in the network "hear" the transactions in a different order.  
Back to a "regular banking" example:  If you think about your checking account, if you have $50 in it, and you write checks for $100, $200, and $400 one day and have a $700 deposit, depending on which order the transactions post, you may bounce zero, one, two, or three of those checks.  Obviously, if you have machines all over the internet all trying to maintain account balances, there needs to be a consistent way for EVERYONE to agree whether the money is in the account or not, given that transactions may arrive at different times.
The way this is resolved in Bitcoin is to "lock" transactions into place.  Take a set of transactions, and "perform some work" on them, so that they cannot be over-turned unless someone performs MORE work than you performed.  And Block Chain maintains this sequence of transactions, so you can tell which set of transactions occurred first, which second, which third, and so on.
So the "Work" performed is very compute intensive.  Tons of electricity, specialized equipment, etc.
PPcoin tried to address that by shifting from "Proof of Work" to "Proof of Stake".  Instead of performing a bunch of work, you prove that you have a stake in the success of PPCoin by showing your coins.  You actually have to "destroy" some coins to prove your stake. 
It's a different method of proof, intended to make it less expensive to run the network, while still providing security against the double-spend.

If you had A LOT of flexibility on your vanity address (for instance, only requiring a very short match, like 2 letters), and a lot of flexibility on the brain wallet (like allowing a number at the end), then yeah, this wouldn't be too hard to modify vanitygen to take "correct battery horse stable" and append a number and then create a private key, and then a public key and then check it against your requirements.
Definitely possible, but it would take a long time to find it, relative to the standard vanity address.

3.  back up your current wallet    
4.  rename your current wallet to something else    
5.  place your 2011 wallet into the place of the current wallet    
6.  See if there are any funds there    
7.  Pay the address from step 1, all of the funds from your 2011 wallet.    
8.  Verify that the transaction went through.    
9.  put your current wallet back in place and sync, and you will have your coins.

Current internet purchases run as high as 17% fraudulent.  Who do you think ultimately pays for that fraud, when merchandise ships and the charge gets disputed?  The card holder complains; they don't pay.  Visa/MC charges it back to the merchant, who gets stuck with having the chargeback, but having shipped the merchandise.
So EVERY transaction must be uplifted to account for not only the Visa/MC percentage, but also the possibility of fraud.  So, yes, you pay.
In the event of disputes, reliable merchants will refund the bitcoins, or make the buyer whole.  That hasn't changed.  The trick is to do business with only reliable merchants.  If the reliability of the merchant is in question, then you have *the option* of using an escrow service.  
In the traditional model, Visa/MC act as a *very expensive, non-optional* escrow service.  Bitcoin provides a *less costly, optional* model.

Minor technical correction to your comments:
Everywhere you are mentioning "Public Keys", change that to "Bitcoin Address".
The Bitcoin Address is *not* the public key.  They are two distinct things.  The bitcoin address can be derived from the public key (and not vice versa)*, but no one knows your public key until you spend money, at which time it is [revealed in your transaction](
So in effect there are three numbers at play here.  Most users only need to know about two:  the private key and the bitcoin address.  You can only derive them one way:
Given Private Key, you can derive the Public key.     
Given Public key, you can derive Bitcoin Address.
[Here's a diagram]( showing how you can derive the Bitcoin Address from the Public Key.  Clearly they are not the same thing; they aren't even near the same length, and the Bitcoin Address contains checksum information to avoid typos.
See also:  
*edit:  had it backwards; the bitcoin address can be derived from the public key.

Some other suggestions:
If you use SMS gateways, have an option for concise, text only emails (i.e. NOT HTML).  Keep them under 160 characters, counting the subject.  And put the critical info in the first part of the message, in case you get cut off.
In either case, consider adding "fun" to the messages - celebrate highs, mourn lows (like bitcoinity).  Maybe add a (tiny) link into the message to adjust the settings.
Also, have some smart defaults.  10% drop or increase within the last hour is a little extreme (especially lately).  Maybe work it from averages (if the current price is 10% less than the average over the last hour....?)
Also, have an option so that it won't send me a message if it's sent me a message within the past x hours.
Also, have a "sleep" period - I don't want to get messages between 10 PM and 6 AM Eastern time (or whatever).

As I describe Bitcoin to others, I usually describe the bitcoin address as analogous to your bank account number for deposits, and your Private Key as your ATM card, PIN, debit card, and signature all wrapped into one.

I agree.  There are two questions here that need to be looked at separately.  1) Investing decision: should I buy Bitcoins, and 2) Funding decision:  should I borrow from my 401(k).
Thinking that your 401(k) should be "stable, diverse growth for retirement" is actually counter to the incentives that 401(k) tax treatment provides.  As an example, short-term trades, hopping in and out of stocks, sounds like something you wouldn't want to do with "stable, diverse growth or retirement" funds, yet (assuming comparable returns) it's far better to do that in a deferred tax account vs. a taxable account.
Should he buy Bitcoin?  It's speculative.  Most people on here think it's a good bet (at *some* price).  Should he borrow from a 401(k)?  Depends on the rest of the financial position and tolerance for risk.

Well, I clearly am not understanding.
Forgetting about Bitcoin for a moment, if I take out a 640 thousand dollar loan, and then pay off 4 thousand dollars a month, per an amortization schedule, and then I decide to pay an additional 4 thousand dollars of principle, this will reduce the overall amount of thousands of dollars of interest I need to pay over the life of the loan.
Same thing if it's a 640 K Euro loan, with 4 K Euro monthly payments.
Assuming this is a 640 Bitcoin loan, and a 4 bitcoin monthly payment, and the chance to pay an additional 4 bitcoins of principle, this seems to me that it would have the same advantages.

No doubt about it, open source is far less dangerous and less susceptible to bugs than closed source.
I don't worry about the core developers.  I worry about a blackhat dev building credibility and then submitting a small bug that has disasterous one-time consequences for a $1M+ heist.
As I mentioned elsewhere, the software is dependent on multiple platforms, which also are susceptible to bugs.  The libraries, the O.S., the microcode, the hardware.  Several research projects have shown that there are ways to inject code at lower levels which affect the higher levels.  And each of these is a potential vulnerability.   (is anyone reviewing the database code, for example, or the OS code, looking for Bitcoin-specific exploits?  I highly doubt it!)
I once had to troubleshoot a microcode bug that affected financial transactions.  A hacker had apparently found the bug accidentally in MICROCODE, and coded their high level software to exploit it.  And you could look at the source code and SEE there was no bug in the developer's software.  But once you stepped through the compiled code, and tested the registers after each line of code, you could see exactly the failure that the hacker had exploited.  Very ingenious stuff.  Tens of thousands of dollars were stolen.
I love Bitcoin and am not saying that these vulnerabilities are show-stoppers.  But you can't bury your head in the sand on vulnerabilities - that's how you get slaughtered!

This gets argued ad nauseum, but the Wikipedia article (that I linked to) talks about inflation of the money supply.  It is indeed inflation.  Not necessarily price inflation, but inflation nonetheless.  I am not trying to argue that money supply inflation necessarily equates to price inflation (i.e. exchange rate declines).  I am simply stating an undisputable fact - that Bitcoin has a planned inflation rate of the money supply.

Actually, I know someone who had this job, and he drove the biggest piece of shit car, and did NOT look the part.  He loaded ATMs in not so good neighborhoods, and it was his job to make sure he did it in a non-pattern fashion (i.e. not the same time of day every day), and just look like an ordinary guy.
He was packing heat, but other than that, he blended in very well.   He looked like he might be there to repair the ATM; he'd enter a door behind it, with a 'tool kit' which was actually filled with money.  Then he'd exit the door with the toolkit loaded with the deposited checks.

First, you assume direction and magnitude of my Bitcoin gains, both of which were wrong.
Second, "Do you honestly think Bitcoin is going to turn around?" is a question with a false premise.  Presumably, you are saying that Bitcoin is on the decline.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Its security, infrastructure, and vendor support are all on the rise.  Across the board.  Bitcoin itself is definitely on the rise, at the macro level (vendor acceptance, security, and consumer knowledge about Bitcoin are all much higher than they ever were 6 months ago or a year ago).
Now, had you said "Do you honestly think **the exchange rate of** Bitcoin is going to turn around?, that has a different premise.  And the answer to that is yes, personally I do.  I believe that the long term fate is sealed to, but not in the way you do.
But my original point was that your estimate has flawed logic - pulling out a number like $30-$50.  Your logic describes features of the mBitcoin as well, so I guess mBitcoins should be worth $30 to $50 too.  See, it just doesn't hold up, under scrutiny.  
If you are seeking a fundamental "value" of Bitcoins, you are doing it wrong.  Bitcoins have inherent value that no other currency has - no fiat currency nor alt currency nor precious metal.  (and that is, Bitcoin is the most widely accepted, most secure virtual currency in the world, allowing moving value nearly instantly, nearly free, to nearly anyone in the world).  The only thing that directly compares to Bitcoin from this perspective is mBitcoin and other denominations of Bitcoin.   Which, of course, doesn't get you to a value.   The value is simply what you can get for it, as defined by the market.  And that's subject to human psychology and whims and based on how widespread knowledge of Bitcoin is.
I also happen to think the Bitcoin exchange rate will bottom out near $30, before turning around and continuing its four-year journey of trend line of roughly +15% per month.  My belief is based on human tendencies, observation of the pattern Bitcoin has traded under in the past, and a belief that Bitcoin has a huge future.  
The exchange rate pulled off the trend line temporarily from last October until now, and I expect it to return to the trendline.  I expect the price to dip to near $30 by October, before going back to its long term trend of the bottom doubling every five months.  That would put us back in the hundred dollar range no later than this time next year. 
And I have traded with that belief.  (It's never dipped below $16, since March 2013.  It's never dipped below $8 since October 2012 (five months earlier).  It's never dipped below $4 since May 2012 (five months earlier).  It's never dipped below $2 since December 2011 (five months earlier).  It's never dipped below $1 since July 2011 (five months earlier).  It's never dipped below $0.50 since February 2011 (five months earlier).

ah, most miners need not beware.  Very few miners are generating bitcoins.  Mining POOL Operators should beware, because those are the people who are creating the bitcoins, and whose bitcoin address is in the coinbase entry.
They pay pooled miners for use of their hardware.  But FinCEN already said that selling goods and services for virtual currency is not an issue.
So, let's get this straight.  It is my professional opinion, as someone who really has no legal expertise, that SOLO miners and Pool Operators in the US "create" virtual currency, and need to be registered.  Your average pool miner... no.

You make a persuasive argument.
The problem I have with the term Market Cap is that you capitalize a company by buying founders or IPO shares initially.  "Market Capitalization" is a term for the market's value of that capitalization.  Bitcoin just isn't a company and therefore the whole idea of capitalization seems weird.
But I won't fight the "Market Cap is the wrong term" battle anymore, because Monetary Base doesn't seem right either.  Market Value of Monetary base, maybe.  Or if people want to say Market Cap, that's ok too.

Thanks.  You lost me slightly on a typo or two in there.. if you could edit this sentence, I think I would get it:
Because the bitcoin address is a hash of a public key and not the public key itself, transactions in the blockchain effectively give the coins to "anyone who **can has** a private key **has** a related public key that hashes down to this particular string" 
I think you are saying that the actual public key is discarded and never used, but a hash of it is used as part of the Bitcoin Address (along with a checksum).

My inclination would be to dumb it down tremendously.  Maybe you have a sophisticated audience.
I would start with "Bitcoin is Money over IP".  It is a system that allows you to send money to someone without an intermediary (and therefore, with significantly less fees, more privacy, no likelihood of credit-card "chargebacks", and less likelihood of being blocked by the government - think Wikileaks).
Then go into the fact that bitcoin itself has value.   Everyone I talk to wants to know what they are worth, and why.  "What gives them value?"   The answer to this is that there is a free market trading these things for cash, and currently you can buy or sell a Bitcoin for around $29.30.  This fluctuates like any currency does, as people want to buy or want to sell the currency.  (NOTE, this is different from your current statement that "Recent appraisals have Bitcoins ranked at $29.34".  It's not "an appraisal" - it's real bids by real people, and about $2M of real money is changing hands buying Bitcoins every day.  (and on the other side of each transaction is someone who is willing to part with Bitcoins for that same price.)
Then go into "why the heck is someone willing to pay $29 for what is essentially 'monopoly money'?"  And the answer to this is that the currency has some unique properties that no other currency has ever had in the history of mankind.  It's decentralized, fixed supply, non-reversible, and mathematically strong (therefore not easy to counterfeit).  It can also be transferred or stored extremely inexpensively.  No other currency EVER has had these properties. 
Then you can talk about these properties, and what they mean - what they mean to the future of governments, what they mean as far as how useful the currency is, etc.  Also a good time to get people to think "why do you think that a $20 bill and a $10 bill have value?" (because they are essentially 'monopoly money' too - they only have value because people think they have value - there's no gold backing them, or anything like that.  You value the paper because of what you can exchange it for.)
That would be my take on it.  People often don't "get" Bitcoin, because the proponents jump in with the anti-government, or the math angle.  But the real angle that people get is that you can buy shit, pay someone, etc.
You may also need to address how Bitcoins are created.  The Bitcoin system is a "shared ledger", and the miners aren't just "solving a hard math problem".  They are the protectors of the ledger.  It is the MINERS that prevent double-spending, and it is the shared ledger that ensures that the bitcoins being spent are actually owned by the spender.  So the miners get paid for protecting the ledger.  
It seems like this is "free money", but really it's expensive to be a miner - it takes a lot of compute power and a lot of electricity.  But the integrity of the monetary system depends on them.

A traditional banker's head will explode if you say this... 
but he should be able to prove the date that he received the coins (by looking at the blockchain, and by proving that he had the coins in that account 3 months ago, by digitally signing a message with the bitcoin address).
Of course, if the bitcoin address no longer has the coins in it, then it doesn't prove much.  If he has another 25K in a bitcoin address, he could digitally prove that he owns it (and by looking at the block chain, you can see how long he's owned it), and that would be sufficient (but not for a traditional bank!)

Being 90% in bitcoin is fine if you don't have significant assets.  For example, if you make $60K/year, and your Net Worth is $20K, 90% may be a nice, aggressive place.  But if you have $5M in assets, and are 90% in Bitcoin, you are absolutely nuts (unless you have side income generating a few mill a year).


Are you out of your mind?  Price stability shouldn't be measured in terms of months.  Bitcoins lost 65% of their value from early April.
Don't get me wrong, I think Bitcoins are a fantastic long term investment for a lot of reasons.  And if I were 22 and employed, I would put more than 50% of my non-emergency funds into Bitcoins (dollar-cost-averaging in), up to half of my annual salary.  But I'm not.
I personally know people in the $5M category who threw 50K (1%) at Bitcoins, and made 4-10x on their money.  And they are generally sitting tight.  But they will liquidate when their portfolio gets any more lopsided, I am sure.

3.  I wish I could use it to send email.  A better solution might be to simply register my bitcoin address  and then I'd have a simple password, and a fully functioning email client.  (Obviously there'd be no proof that I own the bitcoin address, and that's the problem that you uniquely solve.)

Look at history.  The forum is full of people who, in 2011, at $20 to $30, they said they'd be all in at $10.  But it fell to $10... then to $5... then to $2, or whatever.  It's just human nature to be optimistic at high prices, and then not be able to pull the trigger at lower prices.

I, too, commend Coinbase and other businesses that try to make Bitcoin mainstream.  Don't get me wrong.
Investment in knowledge and understanding should be commensurate to the wealth.  If you are trying to protect $1K worth of Bitcoin investment, holding them online is a much smaller risk.  
For large investments, it's relatively trivial *for mainstream people* to get the knowledge to protect your bitcoins in a manner that suits your life.  Heck, techniques are posted in this forum about every week.  In fact, I'll post a summary right here:
Securely* obtain a paper wallet from [bitaddress.org]( and pay yourself at the Bitcoin Address on the piece of paper.  Then, optionally, securely* use [PassGuardian]( to divide your private key among trusted people and places.  Or simply put copies of the paper wallet in multiple trusted locations.
\* "securely" can be as simple as using a virus-free PC, in a private browsing session, disconnected from the internet, and reboot afterwards.  You can increase your protection by using a Live-CD or a new PC.

Anyone who uses the argument that "people won't want to spend because they know the money will be worth more tomorrow" is only looking at a transaction from one side.
Each transaction has 2 parties - a seller and a buyer.  If people will want Bitcoins to hold, believing that they will be worth more tomorrow, that applies to sellers as well.  Sellers will want those Bitcoins, presumably even more than fiat currency.  So they will offer incentives to get those Bitcoins.  And the market will find a discount level that keeps transactions flowing.
Not to mention, if everyone is 100% certain that it will be worth more tomorrow, then it should be worth almost exactly that now.

Maybe I misread the article, but my take-away was that there's an inherent business risk for exchanges who exchange Altcoins that is not nearly as high as one that just trades Bitcoins.
Because Altcoins can be more easily manipulated, the exchange itself may be vulnerable to losing money and going out of business (or ending up in a deficit situation, in which case your "storage" is with a fractional reserve system that you didn't sign up for).
So, yes, the author presents this as a **storage risk**, since there's an existential risk for such exchanges.

There's an assumption here - that Bitcoin will not exist without the blockchain as it exists now.
There are serious discussions about revising the Blockchain in a lot of ways.  Pruning is one option, which could eliminate any spent outputs, which could eliminate those messages.  And I'd say this is extremely likely to happen in the next 24 months.
So it's not that your message wouldn't be available to be read - it'd be more like a trip to an internet-based museum to view the old blockchain, rather than your troll/wisdom appearing on every node's hard drive (for whatever a hard drive looks like in the next generation).

It's been discussed many times on the forum that Bitcoin is potentially divisible far beyond 8 decimal places, and that this is likely to occur sometime in the future.
How it's implemented is, well, an implementation detail (not intending to oversimplify it, but it's just way too early to predict how it will be implemented).  
But one way to implement it is to define a smaller unit as the atomic unit, rather than the satoshi.  Since this is integer math, "1" represents 1 atomic unit, and COIN tells how many atomic units are in a Bitcoin.    So in order to make the atomic unit much smaller than a satoshi, given that you would still probably like to use integer math, you would set COIN to a much larger number, thereby making "1" be something smaller than a satoshi.
So, no, You're Wrong. I'm right.... at least in one implementation.  No one is suggesting changing the number of Bitcoins to something greater than 21 Million.

Since you didn't, I'll assume US.  
1.  Mt Gox is ok for larger transactions, but $10 or $20.. it's hard to get money there right now, and you'll find that much too cumbersome.  Better options are:  coinbase.com (not too anonymous, and it'll take several days, and 1% commission), or bitinstant (sign up at bitinstant.com; pay at Walmart or CVS, and you can have it very quickly - like ten minutes; higher commission - like 4%+$4.)
2.  Partial transactions are fine.  Buy $20 worth if you want.
3.  see  for some sample commissions.  Mt Gox is about 0.5%.
4.  Localbitcoins.com is the best anonymous, but you may or may not have someone in your area.    Commissions on $20 worth might be a little high too, as you'd be putting someone out to deliver them.  Then again, I'd sell someone $20 worth... pretty low-risk transaction.

You may want to read up on the recent Feathercoin attack.  Essentially, the attacker could build a chain of 6 (or more) consecutive blocks WHILE the main chain was discovering their 6 blocks.  And then the attacker could release all 6 blocks, un-doing the previously recorded longest chain.  And then a boatload of previously confirmed transactions (and coin issuances) get undone.

I agree, but it seems like the OP wants something different.


It's as if he wants to be able to say "I want to have 4 BTC remaining in my wallet after this transaction.  So let me set my ending balance to 4", and then have the transaction amount change (or fee change?).
It seems to me that the most common transaction types are these, in order:
1.  Set the transaction amount, default the fee.  Then change the fee, if you want.     
2.  Set the total amount of the transaction+fee, default the fee and transaction amount, and then allow changing of either (solving for the other).     
3.  Set the amount you want to remain in your wallet, default the transaction amount and fee from that, and then allow adjusting of either (solving for the other).
I think this would do what the OP wants to do, but it'd be tricky to get the UI so that it's intuitive.

1) The miner may never hear about the second transaction, because it wasn't forwarded to them.
2)  You are also touching on [tragedy of the commons]( whereby someone may try to maximize their own short-term profits at the expense of the "system".  If it weakens Bitcoin, it probably hurts long-term profits, so I'm not sure all rational miners would behave in the way you describe - especially mining pools.
The same way that mining pools limited their growth when they got too big, recognizing that by being bigger than 40% made Bitcoin weaker (even though it helped the pool-owner's revenue), I would expect that some pool owners wouldn't follow the "rational" behavior that you describe, and instead follow a long-term rational model, considering what's better for them in the long-term.

I thought it was pretty clear, but let me try to explain again.
There's a [taint analysis]( on blockchain.info.  On there, you can see which addresses are associated with the address in question.
In the example that I gave, if you have 100 BTC in an address, and you send 2 to one address and 3 to another, then both of those two addresses will be associated to the first one.  Presumably those could belong to two different people, as if you spent the Bitcoins.  And then you may even move coins from those two addresses to two different addresses. But as soon as you spend them together in one transaction, it proves that the two addresses are linked to the same person in some way.

There's only $300M of them out there.  Using the 80/20 rule (which admittedly may not apply in this case), say 80% are owned by a small group, and say there are 500,000 people holding Bitcoins at the present time (another wild guesstimate).
You're talking about 100,000 people holding $240M of wealth, or averaging $2400 per person.  No big deal.  And if those 100,000 people all become dollar-millionaires for investing early, I doubt people would be too upset.
Apply 80/20 a couple more times, and you have 20,000 people holding $192K worth of bitcoins (or those wealthy each averaging about $10.6K), and 4000 people holding $154K total (or those wealthy each averaging about $38.5K in wealth).

Not sure a demand for transparency is in order.
In a way, it's like demanding that your bank reveal all its safeguards for your money.   "You're holding my money, therefore I need transparency.  How many digits is the combination to your safe?  What security system do you use, and what time does your guard take a break?"

This is incorrect.


If this were true, then you could simply time the market by buying when everybody is pessimistic.
By far, the best way to time *the stock market* is to use the market seasonality that has been documented in numerous studies.  The simple explanation is that stocks tend to rise around payday.  And they tend to fall (or not rise as much) in between.
This is because funds have an influx of cash that they need to place in the market.  Simple as that.

Well, back then dollars were credit.  If you held a dollar bill, you held an IOU for 23.22 grains of pure gold, thanks to the [Gold Standard Act]( of 1900.
Now, dollars aren't IOUs. Now dollars are money, backed by the full faith and credit of an institution that can print more.   Back in 1912, you couldn't create more gold out of thin air.  But you COULD issue more IOUs than you had the gold for.
Creating IOUs is really a beautiful thing if you can be on the creation side.  Just ask [Pirateat40 and the Bitcoin Savings and Trust company](  
Note that when your IOU creation scheme collapses, it's called a Ponzi scheme.  Before that, it's just a Banking system, the Fed, etc.

You wonder why?
I can give you one speculation.  They had so much money seized by the US Government that they are depending on future trades to be able to fund the backlog of withdrawal requests.
Think about it:  For every dollar seized, they need $100 of EXTRA trades to fund the lost dollar, at 1% trading fee (since they charge both sides of the transaction, this is close.  But really, they only charge one side in dollars, so this is understated.)
You can bet that the Feds waited for there to be a huge amount on deposit, when they seized the cash.  It could have been hundreds of thousands - maybe millions - of dollars.  How long does that take to make up, in trading fees?  (Not to mention his growing legal bills which can't be paid in Bitcoin.)
So, what happens if Karpeles tells the public that they have liquidity problems?  BANK RUN.  What he needs is for people to buy-and-sell on Mt. Gox, not withdraw and flee.  
If he can just keep the business afloat for a little while longer, picking up trading fees along the way, he may be able to salvage it.  He's got plenty of excuses for slow withdrawals that people seem to be buying.  And if he can get people to slowly enter the withdrawal queue (a.k.a. Hotel California Queue), it's in his favor, since he ties up that money and they then cannot take those dollars elsewhere through a Bitcoin purchase.
If he can actually get people to deposit funds with him, he can buy time.  I can't imagine anyone who follows the story is doing that, though!
If there's a Gox Run, he's screwed, and the price of Bitcoin will dive. 
^remember, ^this ^is ^pure ^speculation!

When Bitcoin is at $135, people said "if it ever gets to 2-digits again, I'm buying."
Now that Bitcoin is at $96, some people are saying "I'll buy at the bottom - just not now."  Others are saying, "Oh no, it's tanking.  Get out now."  Still others are thinking "I can sell near $100, and buy back at $80."
Very few are living up to their earlier comment about 2-digits.

Are you not getting this?  With Bitpay, there is no risk of currency fluctuation to the merchant.  They can say "I want $59.95" and they get $59.95 from Bitpay.  Bitpay allows the customer to pay in Bitcoins, and provides dollars (or other fiat) to the vendor.
The volatility doesn't matter to the merchant.  So the merchant can provide better customer service (by giving an additional payment *option*) while saving money on credit card fees and fraud.

Casascius coins are a great novelty. But for long term storage?  Of 10,000 coins???
The beauty of Bitcoin is that you can store it in multiple places for little space / cost, and the cost doesn't rise based on the amount of wealth.  Casascius coins are more like storing Gold, EXCEPT that you have to trust that he'll still be around when you want to cash out, and that he won't take your money in the meantime, and [I think] that a flaw won't be found in his algorithm or website that converts the small number on the coin to a real Bitcoin Private Key.
Personally, that's not a risk I'd take with 10,000 coins ($1M USD).

Remember, you can still transfer money to Mt Gox, and buy Bitcoins while you are on the list.  You just can't get your money out until you are approved.
Obviously there are risks:    
-  You may never be approved, and so your money is stuck.  (If you are legit, I think this is a low risk)     
-  Gox could get hacked while your coins or money is in there.  (pretty low risk, I would hope, at this point)     
-  Your account could get hacked while your coins or money is in there (use 2-factor authentication, a strong password, a virus-free pc, etc)

Mining: "monetizing electricity" - I don't like that.
Mining is performing a bookkeeping function.  It's really not that a miner is trying to solve a hard problem - they are really looking for a needle in a haystack.  They pick a random number, perform a well documented hash function, and check to see if the number they picked was a good one.
The "hard problem" that miners (as a whole) solve is this:  How can you sequence some events without a central server?  How can you definitively mark events, to know that some events definitely came before other events, in a decentralized model.
I can take a picture of me holding a newspaper that shows a picture of the first lunar landing, and you know that the picture was taken on or after July 1969.  But how can you tell that it was BEFORE some other picture of me (in a decentralized model)?  Say I have another picture of me holding up a newspaper that describes Nixon and Watergate (1970's).  Which picture was taken earlier?
The way Miners solve this issue is to take transactions and pile a shit-load of work on top of them, such that in order to "re-sequence" the events, you'd need to perform the same amount of work onto the new sequence.
By performing the needle-in-a-haystack search, they are performing a ton of work.  And each time a block is solved, the sequence of every block prior to that, gets solidified even more.

not necessarily.  You probably aren't going to melt this down for its silver content (although you could).  The 2 main components (silver + 1 bitcoin worth of virtual currency) makes it worth AT LEAST the price of its components.  (at least it costs that much to make it, plus manufacturing costs).  But it's really worth whatever you can get someone to pay you for it.
Some of the series 1 gold bitcoins made the original owners a lot of money over what they paid.
Personally, I think there's a risk that it's never worth anything but the silver.  Somehow you need to be able to cash it in for real bitcoins, and that ability could go away if ~~the Casascius guy (Mike Caldwell) dies/end up in jail, etc.~~ the private key is unreadable when you go to look at it.

I've been looking at the bottoms, back to $0.50.  You can see that if you draw a straight line on the log-scale price chart from $0.50 to $8 (in October 2012), you have a line that increases approximately double every 5 months.  
It puts us at about $16 at the end of March, and $32 at the end of August.
I think we're on a different trajectory now - with the resistance point of $50 in April, which may never be breached.  Then again, if the price dropped to $20 today, it wouldn't surprise me too much.

From the US here:

Also coinbase direct.
The current BEST option (in my opinion) for US is coinbase (but I recommend transferring any significant amount out of there once you buy, and to a secure paper wallet), with bitinstant right behind it, and maybe better for small quantities.  Mt. Gox is cheapest, but takes forever to get set up.

The Bitcoin addresses have a check sum in them, so (if I recall correctly), it'd be worse than a 1/32,000 chance that you would hit a valid bitcoin address with a typo.  The clients check this, and it would stop the transfer from ever happening.
If you picked some address that was valid, but unused, the bitcoins would sit there until they were claimed, which is to say a very long time.  No technology exists today to claim lost coins.

"The fundamental structure that leaves it open for abuses and speculations by botnet operators" is the wild-west, unregulated nature combined with the major fluctuations in price.
In other words, you are correct that the fundamental structure (math behind Bitcoin) isn't leaving it open - it's the fundamental structure (lousy supporting infrastructure like exchanges, plus human nature in bubble/crash mode) of Bitcoin that is the issue.

yeah, because certain drugs and file copying torrents are illegal in the US, and everyone stopped using those too.
I know it's hard for Americans to imagine, but the US isn't the whole world.  And if the US made Bitcoins illegal, those countries who do not like the position of the US Dollar as the default world currency would most likely support Bitcoins, and use the US ban as a propaganda tool.  
Banning in one jurisdiction, even the US, even the US and her allies, will not put Bitcoins out of business.

The shared ledger is called the "Block Chain".   Picture it as a book, with a giant spreadsheet, where the columns represent each account (referenced by Bitcoin Address), and the rows are transactions (reducing one account, and increasing another account).
The "book" of transactions fill up one page at a time.  And every ten minutes or so, the bookkeepers turn the page.
You can validate that someone has money in their account by examining the transactions history of that account.   Anything on the current page hasn't been "confirmed" yet, but if you look back a few pages, those have been confirmed many times.  Those aren't going to change.

I believe those are "ghost lines".  The concept is to show the order book over time.  A fatter grey line is a recent picture of order book, the thinner the grey line, the older the ghost line.
The order book changes every time someone puts in (or cancels) an order to buy or sell.  
If you consider the case where no one puts in or cancels any orders away from the "market price", then the ghost lines will remain parallel.  However, if someone puts in an order (or cancels an order) away from the market price, the ghost line will not be parallel to the blue line.

It's probably more like this.  
(1) You're on a date with your best girl.  Someone really special, and so you take her to Burger King.  Despite the fact that she's obviously a heavy eater, you size up the potential cost of the meal as probably being under $20.
(2) **You send yourself a $20 gift card from the app**, and pay with Bitcoins. You are paying bitpay, and bitpay pays gyft who pays Burger King for the card.  (apparently the correct way to do this currently is to send the card to yourself, as opposed to buying the gift card directly, as others have mentioned.  You buy the card before you enter the restaurant, as part of the date setup, along with buying your condoms.)
(3) Your date orders her food.  You say "Holy crap that was a lot of food", and so you order a diet coke.  The bill comes to $11.94.
(4) The app now registers that you have a giftcard and displays a QR code.
(5) The merchant points his scanner at your phone, your meal is paid for.  (You still have money left on the card for your next special night out with your best gal.)

1.  Real mining pools with real interfaces that need to work.    
2.  Higher difficulty.     
3.  More competition for Bitcoins.     
4.  Far more usage.    
If my unit arrived, and it didn't work in real mining, but worked on the testnet, I would find it to be pretty worthless.  If you think there's money to be made on selling machines that work on testnet, and don't feel they need to be tested on the real network, go start that business, and see how it goes.
Again, I WANT my unit to be tested on the real network.  I see no reason to get a machine that works flawlessly on the testnet but hasn't been tested on the real network.

I'm not sure if this is the best way (since I haven't had much luck selling yet on localbitcoins) but I have decided to have a very fixed plan:
Pick a percentage markup.  I chose 2%.  And then be very rigid:
"I sell in blocks of $100.  I buy them on Mt. Gox for $98 within an hour of my sale, and I sell them to you for $100.  I sell Saturday mornings at 9:30 AM in the Walmart parking lot, under the cameras, for your protection and mine.
I will buy on Mt. Gox in advance, and put the bitcoins in a paper wallet.  I will email you the Bitcoin Address in advance, so you can verify that the coins are in the wallet.  
At the point of the transaction, you hand me a single envelope with $100 in it, exactly five twenties.  I hand you a paper wallet which has the private key.  You can immediately verify that the Bitcoin address is the same as the one I emailed you, and you can immediately import the private address into Blockchain.info and move the money to your own wallet.  or you can leave it in the paper wallet  (trusting that I didn't make a copy).  All transactions are final.
I will use bitaddress.org to generate a paper wallet.  Go to that site's homepage and wait ten seconds to see the format of what you will be buying.  If you are unsure of this, practice the import with a paper wallet generated from that site, so you know exactly what we are doing during the transaction.
I am not doing this to make a lot of money.  I am doing this to help people get access to Bitcoins, and so I am only asking for 2% over what I am paying.  Obviously there is also a commission that Mt. Gox is charging which is in addition to what I am charging you, as it was included in my cost.  The 2% just helps me cover my time and inconvenience."
I think that's a reasonable process.  I will sell up to ten a day (to stay within the FinCEN guidelines of $1000 per day to any person).
What do you think?   Too rigid?

You can tell that the author doesn't quite get it when they say: 


A Bitcoin is not a number.  A Bitcoin is a unit of account.  This statement is sort of like if you asked someone what a "meter" was, and they showed you a meter of rope.  And then you said "OK, a meter is threads of twine woven together..."
A bitcoin is **not** "simply an SHA-256 hash (which is an extremely large number)".  Because what does that make a half of a Bitcoin?  Half of a large number?
A Bitcoin is a unit of account.  If you have one bitcoin, your account has the number 1 (BTC) in it.

The question I was answering was why would merchants ACCEPT Bitcoin.  Your question flips it around.
I believe that if I am dealing with a reputable merchant, they will refund my money if I am dissatisfied, and I won't need to use the "charge-back" feature of my credit card.  I rarely use that anyway.
So, if you look at all the other benefits - perhaps a "cash discount" that gets applied to Bitcoins, perhaps a lower price, perhaps a good feeling by supporting a Bitcoin merchant (knowing it's in my self-interest).  Those are all reasons I have bought things with Bitcoins.

I'm generally a buyer, not a seller, so the trick now is to try to buy at the very bottom.  Who knows when that is.  Some would say that when it establishes a "base", that's the right timing.  Personally, I think that's a little too late.

It's a shame that generous tips are not only a reward for good service, but also a vote for the system whereby the employer doesn't pay a reasonable wage.
But that's the system that waiters and waitresses are agreeing to, when they accept the job, so they really shouldn't complain when people exercise their right to vote against the system that is oppressive to them.
If waiters found that they couldn't make ends meet due to low tips, then demands of the work force would force employers to raise salaries.

But they could do that as one step.  
Best method:   Shop, fill cart, checkout, pay with bitpay.  [wait one hour if they want].  Then they secure the domain names.
Their method:  Shop, fill cart, go to checkout with Bitcoin.  It says "To use Bitcoin, you have to pick some amount of dollars to convert bitcoins to.  How many would you like?"  You pick a number (greater than, or equal to the shopping cart amount), pay with bitpay, wait an hour, then try to checkout again, this time with prepaid dollars.
It's just an ass-backwards way of doing it.  It should be just the same way as credit cards.  At checkout, pay with Bitcoins.

Email can be used by terrorists to nearly instantly and privately (if you try hard enough) communicate their plans.
I was not planning on communicating any evil plans with anybody, but I still got my email set up as soon as I could.  I could see that pretty soon everyone would like a system that allows nearly instant, nearly free, direct person-to-person communication with nearly anyone in the world - as soon as they got email as well.
That's what the Bitcoin advocate generally believe - that this is the beginnings of a system that will be widespread in a decade:   Bitcoin provides near-instant, nearly free, direct transfer of value to nearly anyone in the world.  So, should you "invest"?  well, that's up to you.  Is it worth tinkering with, just to learn?  My answer is most definitely, if you are into life-long learning and trying to stay ahead of the crowd.

Take it up with them, through the normal channels.
BitInstant has been around for quite a while, and they have addressed issues.   We see a lot of "They wronged me" with no follow-up when "they made it right again".

You might try Twilio or sendhub for SMS texting (or any of the companies mentioned on TechCrunch's SMS page:  )
You might also just use email to reach people's phones via [SMS gateways](  Nearly every phone now has an email address that you can use to get an SMS message through.  Your website just needs to remind people of that fact, and help them put in their correct email address for SMS (and test it so that you aren't spamming the wrong phone).

Yes, you can have the same wallet on two computers.  You can copy the wallet.dat file.   Keep in mind, though, that they may become different as soon as you start doing something on either.
You will probably only generate a few pennies by mining, and it won't cover your electric bill, if you are new to the game (and aren't using ASIC mining equipment).  But it is probably a good learning experience.
What you probably want to do is to deliver your mined coins to one address on your mining machine, and then PAY them to another address that is either on another machine or a paper wallet (bitaddress.org).  Or, frankly, for the few micro-pennies that you get from CPU mining, you may just want to leave them on that PC, and save yourself the hassle.

The above statement is true if Hashes per second require the same amount of effort a year from now as they do today.  But this ignores technology improvements.
I'll try to clarify:  A miner could get the same income for the same effort at a higher difficulty if technology improves.  And the first generation of ASICs are just the start.  The huge hurdle and capital expense to design the first chip has been overcome.  Printing more chips of the same design is super cheap (relative to the initial design costs), and printing chips of the same design at a smaller size (and therefore more efficient) is also much cheaper than the initial design effort.
So there are more variables at play here than meets the eye.  But I do get what you are saying.  I thought you were saying that difficulty drives price (which I disagree with).  Instead, now I believe you are saying that if a difficulty were high, the price would need to be high to justify the cost of mining.
To which my answer is - not if the cost goes down.

The decision to cash out is really more of a decision of diversification.  If you were lucky enough to grow your Bitcoin investment so that it's more than 10% of your net worth, you may want to diversify.  (For some people, that number might be 5%, others 20%).
It's just smart portfolio management.  While Bitcoin has a high potential reward, it has a high risk too.

Not sure about opencoin.
Zerocoin lays on top of Bitcoin, and allows you to sort of deposit your bitcoins into a pool of anonymity.  And then when you want to spend them, you prove ownership in the pool, and are granted a fresh coin to spend.  It's a very cool implementation, and I think that's the long-term answer for Bitcoin anonymity.
Zerocoin will presumably work on specific denominations (like 1 Bitcoin, .1 Bitcoin, .01 Bitcoin, as examples of three separate anonymity pools).  So for each one you deposit, you can withdraw at a later date the same amount.
Last I saw, it looked like the Zerocoin designers put in an optional backdoor (probably in an attempt to avoid accomplice prosecution under money laundering laws), which will likely optionally be ignored by the miners.  So I have confidence that it will be a good answer.   
Once zerocoin gets implemented, watch Satoshi's coins finally get spent, little by little.

I could imagine Bitcoins being lost due to typos, if you accidentally committed a typo when establishing your password or passphrase, and locked yourself out.
I could also imagine Bitcoins being lost due to typos in code.  (someone recently created a transaction "by hand" using the live network, and accidentally forgot to return the change to themselves, causing a giant fee (the change) to go to the miners.)  That's not really what you are asking, though, either.
The chances of sending to the wrong address via a typo are infinitesimal.  The checksum would cause the typo'd Bitcoin Address to fail validation before the transaction was even created.

As much as I like to root for Bitcoin companies to succeed, and I think it'd be good for Mt. Gox to pull their butt from the flame, I think there's some serious risk.
My question is, who is still sending them money?
OK, so they lost $5M in seizures, and they made $9M including the major run-up recently (in April).  They spent a ton on new servers, setup, and revised software.... they must be cutting it close on cash.
I believe that they can claim not to be "fractional reserve" by reflecting the seized money as "on deposit with the US Government".  They may never see it again, but I suppose they could look Roger Ver in the eye and say "we're not fractional reserve".  They could probably even show books that, with a cursory view, might look solvent.

If I understand your point, you're saying that by accepting the fees built into a block, you are "accept[ing] such de-centralized convertible virtual currency from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency."
That language is about exchanges, I think - accepting and transmitting virtual currency in exchange for [real/fiat] currency.
I don't understand how accepting a transaction fee is anything like that.  You aren't taking virtual currency in, and handing fiat out.

@_date: 2013-08-22 18:54:13
Well, the $5M was verified in the article linked on this page (2.9M + 2.1M).
The $9M was from a comment Karpales made on the bitcoin forum, which I can't find.  He said basically he couldn't give comments as it would only make things worse, but that you can look at their volumes and see that they made $9M,
You can see [here]( that they have had a volume of 9M BTC, since April, and if the transactions averaged $100/BTC and 1% transaction fee (counting buyers and sellers), then the math adds up exactly.
**But, perhaps there's the problem!  Only half of that is in US Dollars (and seized).  The other half is in Bitcoins.**  So technically, they may have enough assets to back all of the US Dollars on account (so they are "solvent", and Roger Ver wasn't lying with his YouTube Ransom Video), but it's mostly in Bitcoins.  And how do they, Mt. Gox, convert tens of thousands of Bitcoins to dollars?
They could sell some on their own exchange (something they said they wouldn't do - act as a counterparty to any transactions).  Or they can work with other exchanges, selling and driving the price down elsewhere.  Or they can wait until another $5M of fees come in (so $500M+ of transactions).  Or maybe they are trying a combination of these things.
[Here's]( the comments in the forum, but again, I can't find the reference to $9M that I remember.  It might be in that discussion and I didn't find it.

You can accept payment today with Bitpay, and convert IMMEDIATELY to dollars or 10 other currencies, all or part of the payment.  There's little risk to the vendor, and only up-side:
1.  You get a cash deposit in the currency of your choice immediately.    
2.  You have zero chance of charge-backs.    
3.  You provide another payment option for your customers. Customer service!    
4.  You can offer a discount because there are lower fees and less likelihood of fraud as compared to credit cards.    
5.  You get IMMEDIATE press for offering to accept Bitcoin.     
6.  The Bitcoin community actually is supporting early vendors!

Actually, I think trading BTC for LTC is more like trading BTC for Euros (from the perspective of a US Citizen).
And to extend that analogy, exchanging US Dollars for BTC, and then BTC for LTC might be like exchanging US Dollars for Yen and then trading Yen for Euros.  I am not a tax accountant or a currency investor (other than USD and BTC), but I believe that the USD-&gt;Yen-&gt; Euro transaction does not trigger capital gains (until you pull it back into USD).
So, I stand by my guess (and it is just a guess) that moving money from USD to Bitcoin to any non-USD currency isn't (yet) a taxable event.
But if this is true, it could prop up the value of LTC to some extent, as a holding place for active traders.  
I do like this expression:       
"LTC is the Lone Ranger to Bitcoin's Silver."  (it gets a free ride...)

Now, some music-playing or video-playing software can be written that permits you to commit some payment - say 1 BTC for the year or whatever, and then to trickle-pay per use.
That's the same model as you said earlier:


And this music or video app could also sign up to pay artists... after the first x minutes of total viewing/listening time, we pay 99.9% directly to the artist.  We commit to paying 1 BTC, and trickle pay it, as it comes in.
Again, same model as you said is enabled with this new protocol.

Small error in the presentation that refers to the Bitcoin Address as the Public Key - a common mistake.
Two major issues, and reasons to point this out:  
1) if the Bitcoin address was the Public key, then the system would be less secure, as it's easier to go from a public address to the private address (i.e. expected to be possible with the right Quantum computers)
2)  You can't use the digital signature feature without revealing your public key.  This can be used for signing text messages, for proving that you are an account holder, etc.
And of course, this is used for spending.  That's why the public key is included in each transaction - so that the transaction can be verified.  The bitcoin address cannot be used to verify transactions, only the public key can.
If you are trying to be technically accurate, remember, the Bitcoin Address is NOT the same as the public key. It is derived from the public key with a hashing function.

You're on the right track (if you are trying to describe it for computer scientist geeks), but probably an unnecessary level of detail for the average person.
Also, really it's not so much "solving of a problem" as it is "searching for a number".  Miners repeatedly try different random numbers plugged into an equation (hash) that also includes information from the previous block as well as the transactions of the current block.  And if the answer to the hashing process ends up having some extremely rare property, then they win.  And the more miners that participate, the more rare the property of the answer must be.
I'm sure you know all this, but I'm trying to put it into words that people can understand.

This doesn't make a lot of sense.  The reason for transaction fees is that each transaction takes up a certain amount of a fixed resource - which is limited by the maximum block size.
One of the reason for fees was to discourage very very tiny transactions (which spam the network).  Making them a fraction of the transaction value would be the opposite of this - encouraging small transactions, and punishing big ones.
Making them a function of the resource consumed (i.e. a function of the transaction size) makes a lot of sense.  If you create a transaction with a lot of inputs and outputs, you should pay extra for that.  If you make a transaction that consumes a minimal portion of the block (regardless of the number of BTC transferred), then that should be minimum fees.

I am liking this trollcast more and more.   Here is one way to work the numbers.  
The underlying theory here is that there is a general uptrend in market cap that can be measured by a straight line on the log graph (i.e. a daily percent increase).  And that the market cap tends to periodically retreat to a base line (and never go much below it) at its worst, and then, during periods of hype, it pulls above this baseline during the hype phase, and then slowly burns off the hype over the course of several months, to return to the baseline and start the cycle all over.
If you look back to April 2011, you can see 4 cycles, each lasting about 7 months long:  first, about a month-and-a-half or increasing market cap (hype), followed by a burn-off of about 5.5 months.  Then, the cycle repeats.  (We're in the middle of the 4th cycle.)
Two of the "low points" in these cycles (i.e. the beginning of the cycle of increases), were 11/17/2011 (market cap = $15.37M), and 1/6/2013 (market cap = $142.1M), 416 days apart.  If you connect those two dots with a straight line (on the log graph), you get an upwardly sloping base line that the market cap keeps returning to.  The slope of that line indicates that the market cap is increasing by 0.536% per day.  (calculation:  The change in market cap over those 416 days was 9.2442 times (that is, 142.1/15.37 = 9.2442).  And so the daily gain in market cap is 9.2442^(1/416) = 1.00536 = 0.536% gain per day.)
Even more interesting, it appears that the period of hype varies a little each time, but that if you measure the time between the peak and the end of the cycle, 5.5 months is pretty consistent.
So that would mean that we're in a burn-off period expected to last from April 10 (the last peak) to Sept 25th (5.5 months later).
Mathematically, you can calculate a forecast of the market cap on Sept 25 to be about $577M, based on the baseline.  And you can forecast how many bitcoins will be in existence (based on the current mining rate), to be 11.72M Bitcoins, so expect the price to bottom out at approximately $49.21.  ... if the past is an indication of future performance.  which it isn't, necessarily.

The interesting thing about your proposal is that you are starting at Satoshis, and working up.   People usually start at Bitcoin, and work down.
Therefore, bitcent is to Bitcoin what cent is to dollar - where one "century" is 100 years, one cent is one one-hundreth of a dollar.  So 1 bitcent being 0.01 BTC makes sense with that logic.
Also using that logic, and the standards defined by scientific prefixing conventions, it's already defined:  1 millibitcoin is 1 one thousandth, or 0.001 BTC.   The nickname "millie" is just cute, I think.
And one microbitcoin is one 1 millionth, or 0.000001 BTC.  Again, "mikey" is a cute / human version.
I do think that it's easier for people to think in terms that you describe, working UP from a Satoshi, rather than down from a Bitcoin.  People are more comfortable with thousands, millions, and billions, rather than thousandths, millionths, and billionths.  But the Satoshi seems like an arbitrary place to start - especially if it may not be the smallest unit someday.
If you do build off of the Satoshi, maybe it should be KiloSatoshi, MegaSatoshi, and GigaSatoshi.  One GigaSatoshi is 10 BTC (I think).

Bitcoins are a "randomly assigned set of unique numbers" as much as dollars are - that it, they aren't!  Just because your bank account has a number  (and your dollar has a serial number) doesn't mean a dollar is a "randomly assigned set of unique numbers".  That's a silly description.
Bitcoins are NOT STRINGS OF NUMBERS!  (how many times do journalists need to hear this before it gets through their thick skulls?)   Your Bitcoin **Address** has similarities to your bank account number, and yes, it's a string of numbers (and letters).  And your **Private Key** has similarities to your ATM Pin, and yes it's a string of numbers (and letters).  But Bitcoin is more of a shared ledger than a coin.  A bitcoin is NOT a set of unique numbers.  It's a ledger entry, just like your bank balance is a ledger entry saying how many dollars are in your bank account.
QUIT DESCRIBING IT AS A STRING OF NUMBERS!   That just adds to the confusion.

Learn everything you can about protecting your bitcoins.  I mean everything.  There's nothing that will turn you off more, than investing 10K, and watching some thief walk away with it.
Did you know that 45% of bitcoin exchanges and places to store bitcoins online have failed?  Many have failed with the customers having huge losses.  Basically, this means that you should consider limiting your exposure to having any Bitcoins sitting on someone else's website.  Coinbase is great for consumers... but leaving bitcoins on Coinbase (or anywhere online) has risks.  
Remember, "why do thieves rob banks?  Because that's where the money is."  Online stashes of coins have giant targets on them - whether that's thieves trying to hack their software, or thieves trying to hack your password to their site.
Do you know about 2-factor authentication?  Do you have 2-factor set on every online repository of Bitcoins?
Do you know about paper wallets, and "cold storage"?  Why not take an amount like $10K, and put the vast majority of it into Cold Storage?  (and if it doesn't seem like "it's worth the hassle", you are doing it wrong.)   is a trusted way to do this.
A friend of mine wanted to buy "just $5K", and I gave him all the warnings.  Finally convinced him to put it on a paper wallet.  (It had grown to $50K by that point.)  The very next day after he moved it, the online bitcoin exchange that he previously was using for storage shut down, and he dodged a HUGE bullet.  He nearly kissed me on the lips!
Make absolutely sure you have your online wallet encrypted and backed up (if you are using Bitcoin-QT), and look into other software and spread your risk.
I took my holdings and split it up into multiple bitcoin addresses (on paper) - sort of like holding a $100, 2 $50's, 5 20's, a few tens, a few 5's and a few 1's.  Then when I want to spend it or sell it, I select the paper wallet that is about the size that I want to liquidate, and I only expose a limited amount to the internet that way.  
Paper is easy to store safely.
Also look into SSS (Shamir's Shared Secrets) for a way to safely split up your pass phrase or private keys and give them to multiple parties.   is a great way to do that.
@_date: 2013-07-25 21:47:07
If you move them around in a chunk, this works well.  
But say you buy 100 BTC, and fan them out to 10 addresses of various sizes.  If you use one program (like BitcoinQT) with all these Bitcoin Addresses, at some point the program may link them back together.  Like, if you have 2BTC in one, and 3BTC in another, and you pay someone 4BTC, it could spend both of those addresses, and return the change.  It'd be trivial to see that you fanned out the Bitcoins, but that the same person had those 2 addresses (since they were used  as an input to the same transaction).
Probably not a huge deal, but something to think about.  Look at the "taint" on blockchain.info, and see how addresses can be linked together via spending habits.  Not perfect proof, but definitely a concern.

As much as I'd like to see the price skyrocket, I'll give you the opposite perspective.... (knowing that this subreddit hates negativity, and that I'll likely get voted down).
Hypothetical investor - friend of a friend, say - invested about $50K back when it was in the $20's.  Watched it turn into a half-mil.... then settle down to be $200K to 300K range and "fairly" stable.  While he believes in the long-term value of Bitcoin, it's just too much of his portfolio to be in that one investment.  So he wants to sell some, but just then, Mt. Gox shuts down withdrawals.
Choices two weeks ago were to wait, or to transfer some to another exchange and sell there (at significantly lower prices).   He chose to wait.  
Over the two week period he sees his investment dropping, and so he wants to pull some money off the table, and get back to a "50K investment" level.  So he starts selling as rapidly as possible on Coinbase.  50 coins per day.
Now Gox withdrawals are back up and running, but not tested.  So the 50 coins per day trickle out, until he can sell about 2000 coins.  Not a massive dump, but a lot of small dumps.
Is he the only one?  Or are there 100 or 1000 people like him out there?

So wait... let's put some numbers on this.  Say the insider knows the company is going to sell for $35/share (and it's currently selling for $13/share).   ...I tried picking numbers on scale with the S.DICE numbers.
As a shareholder, if I'm sitting here with a bunch of shares, that I can sell for $13, and some insider starts buying, then the price is going to head toward $35.  If the insider knows that the selling price will be $35, then he will rationally buy all he can afford, as long as the price is less than $35 (maybe minus a small amount to cover risk of the deal falling through, and fees).  That did not hurt me, the investor at all.
In fact, the sudden move by an insider might get others to move, and the price may rise above $35, actually benefiting me as an investor.
The only people who are hurt are the sellers, who have made the decision that the company isn't worth more than, say, $20/share.  And they do that with their own free will and lack of information.
Yes, it's a rigged game, but it actually would get information to the market faster, and probably somewhat smooth out the stair-step rise from $13 to $35.
The people who would feel cheated are:  a) the ones who sold at $20 today instead of waiting for $35 tomorrow.  (when in reality, they got $20 today instead of $13 today).  And b) the people who bought into the run-up and guessed wrong by buying at more than $35.  Their loss for gambling!

I believe people will tolerate some level of short-term volatility, in exchange for long-term stability and growth.  The history of bitcoin fluctuations shows that at this time that anyone who has ever held onto their bitcoins for 22 months has done just fine, while the short-term fluctuations can be as great as a 75% drop in 3 days.  
I think it's expected that as more people get bitcoins in their hands, and as time goes on, the short-term fluctuation issue will be less dramatic (like other mainstream currencies).  Not sure what the long-term outlook will be like in the future, but nothing goes up forever.
A comment on your specific quote:


I think this is a 50% drop.  (100% drop would be to zero, effectively making Bitcoins worthless, and no number of Bitcoins will have the same buying power as before; a scenario that I see as highly unlikely.)

Not **everyone** thinks this is a bubble.  In fact, you couldn't even maintain that position for 2 sentences!
When the market cap hits $1B, which will almost inevitably happen within the next year or two, some major player will step in and either buy Mt Gox and make it "Charles Schwab Mt Gox bitcoin exchange", "Mt Gox of E*Trade", "Morgan Stanley Chase Gox" or something, and the legitimacy will be established, pushing it rapidly to $10B.
Or some mutual fund will offer legitimacy through a fund:  "Barrons Bitcoin Fund" or "Vanguard Bitcoin Fund", and it will enable a whole new buying class.  And then it will rapidly rise further.
Those will be bubble days for sure!

This is not a flaw.
Basically the confirmation process is a process of performing a bunch of work to a transaction, "piling work onto it", so that if someone wanted to reverse the transaction, they would have to perform an equivalent amount of work.
When one block is confirmed, a hash of the block is included into the next block (hence the term "block CHAIN"), and so the next confirmation essentially piles MORE work onto the earlier transactions.
No "extra" work is being performed, hogging resources.  It is just part of the system, such that older transactions are the most secure by having the most "work" piled onto them.

Every successful currency and commodity has an inherent value.  Gold is shiny, has historical value, can be used for jewelry, and has industrial uses.  Dollar has the law (can be used for "all debts, public and private") and the "full faith and credit (with a tanking credit rating) of the US Government".
The inherent properties of Bitcoin that have value are: 
-  Fixed supply; cannot be inflated by people     
-  Ability to transmit value to another person anywhere for almost free.    
-  Operates with a "trust no one" model; no trust of intermediaries are necessary for Bitcoin to work.    
-  Ability for you to "be your own bank".  You can store, transmit, and guard your wealth without fear of someone confiscating it or going out of business.  
**That is what "backs" Bitcoin.**  That is its inherent value.

presumably if you enable 2-factor, then it's required from then on.
Mt. Gox has a curious setup whereby it's possible to enable 2-factor so that it must be used anytime you withdraw funds, but not enable it for the changes to the security parameters.  This means that a thief simply has a 2-step process - first disable 2-factor, then steal.
@_date: 2013-06-27 08:37:42
There are two definitions of inflation.  One is monetary inflation (the rate of generation of the currency), and the other is price inflation (prices going up relative to the currency, therefore the currency's value going down).  I believe the original definition of inflation was the former, while common-folk tend to see the end result (the latter), so the latter became the more common definition.
But technically, the author is correct, but not specific.

No, it's actually assuming that blocks get solved at the same rate as they have since November 28.
You're right, this isn't necessarily an accurate assumption, but I just "straight-lined" it.  
Another projection might look at the last 1000 blocks, and assume we keep at that pace for the rest of the 210000 blocks.  These calculations look like this.
Current Height:  254051  2013/08/24 18:07    
1000 ago       :  253051  2013/08/19 17:29
1000 blocks took 5.026 days     
we have 165.949 thousand blocks left, or 834.12 days.
That means that the 420000 block would be solved on **December 6th 2015**.
Very doubtful that we'll keep up production at the pace of the last five days, but this is extremely eye-opening!
*Edit:  I had two different date formats in there.... thought I should clarify the "December" part.

[I complained on here]( about how I found their Bitcoin payment process frustrating, and they fixed it.
@_date: 2013-03-02 07:48:46
I disagree.  There are several ways to do this, and they aren't too challenging.
1. If a fund claimed to have, say, 50,000 BTC "on account" at the end of the quarter, all they'd need to do is point to a Bitcoin Address with the funds in it, and then use the digital signature process to prove that they own the account.  Even if you got your statement ten days later and the money had moved, you'd be able to see that in the ledger.
2.  Same thing for personal accounts, although it's a little trickier.  Like if I had 1000 BTC in my account with a broker, they'd have to prove that they were holding it *for me* and not double counting it.  But that could be done with a more public audit-able list of all of their accounts numbers and the associated Bitcoin address.
@_date: 2013-05-16 21:39:48
When the block confirms, you can see who forwarded the confirmation to blockchain.info, on blockchain.info.  This is often the mining guild that confirmed it.
So look at your particular Bitcoin Address on Blockchain.info, click on the transaction number, and see what block it's in.
But i wouldn't hold my breath, unless it was ridiculously high and/or an obvious error.
@_date: 2013-06-10 15:12:31
It seems that way, doesn't it.  However, I contend that the balance of power in Bitcoin has shifted.  
Now, if you propose a change that will fork the blockchain, you have to convince a majority of people accepting Bitcoin.
To give an extreme example as a demonstration, imagine if a proposed fork gets implemented, and only ONE miner accepts it, but 100% of the merchants and exchanges accept it.  Now everyone with Bitcoins can only spend them on the "forked" chain.  The unforked chain is now worthless.
Now the balance of power is with Mt. Gox, Bit Pay, Coinbase, and others who accept Bitcoins as payments.

I could see a settlement with Gox being "We'll let you off the hook for not checking the box on the form, as long as you reveal all records of who bought and sold Bitcoins, and all of the verification records pertaining to the addresses that you transferred coins to, and the terms of this settlement cannot be revealed at anytime".  If he doesn't comply, then he cannot set foot in the US at any time (and he can be extradited).

The problem is that the less exchanges, legitimate businesses, etc., the less liquid Bitcoin is.  And so it won't be of value even in the black market.  It can't survive as only a Black Market currency.
That would be like if the drug world all decided that they were going to use shiny marbles* as a currency.  Nobody at the end of the chain wants to be stuck with a pile of shiny marbles.  You have to be able to convert them to something legit.

Here's another way to look at the difficulty...
The current difficulty target starts with 13 zeros and a 2 (in hex, which is **00**10 in binary), which translates to a string of 54 consecutive binary zeros (i.e. 13x4+2).  Each time a miner performs a hash, they end up with essentially a random (well, unpredictable) result.  And that result must also have at least 54 consecutive zeros.  It's like flipping a coin 256 times, and the first 54 times must be heads - very improbably.
The items that get appended together and hashed are: a checksum of the previous block, each of the transactions that you are trying to confirm, a transaction that pays this miner the block reward and fees, and a single number of the miner's choosing, called the nonce.  The miner just keeps selecting different nonces until the hash gives him the "54 consecutive heads".
@_date: 2013-07-15 13:37:05
Can you get in back into Bitcoins and transfer it elsewhere?  Or is it gone-gone?
Not that "elsewhere" is much better....  Coinbase seems to be the only one reliably allowing USD cash redemptions to US customers these days in my experience (at 50 BTC per day).  I can't get CampBX to do jack-shit either.
@_date: 2013-02-14 16:21:37
There's a post on bitcointalk that explains what happened, and what Coinbase is doing to fix it.  
My understanding:  Essentially, they sent out some coins which they had received with zero confirmations.   And it started as a large transaction with no fee, so it's likely it would not confirm for a long time, if ever.  And in the thread, there's a guy from Coinbase saying that they have offered a bounty to the miners to confirm the transaction (essentially paying the fee).
I think the bad transaction was initiated by someone else.  (CoinAd, if I recall correctly) although Coinbase isn't entirely fault-free here.  They shouldn't have passed along zero-confirmation money that will never get confirmed.
Have faith in Coinbase to get this straightened out, and be patient.  Refer to this thread for info:  
(I assume you're hit by the same issue talked about there.)

@_date: 2013-04-19 12:51:52
And yet another, more technical explanation:  
The challenge that the miners are trying to solve is to find a number (nonce) which, when "hashed" with a bunch of other numbers (the transactions and a number (hash) from the previous block), is sufficiently small.
So what is a "hash"?  It's a way to mathematically mash up a bunch of numbers in a giant blender, and spit out a nice, unpredictable 256-bit number.  It's just math.
If you think of the unpredictable 256-bit number as analogous to 256 flips of a coin, it can be represented as a series of Heads (H) and Tails (T):  HTHHHTHHTTTHTH... etc
The likelihood of it starting with one head is 50%.  The likelihood of it starting with 2 heads is 25%.  3 Heads: 12.5%.  etc.
Well, right now, the miners have to flip coins and have them come up with somewhere around 53 straight heads at the beginning of their 256 flips.  If they fail, they flip again (with a different nonce). and again.  and again.
The "difficulty" allows you to calculate the number of consecutive heads that are necessary.  (If you think of Heads as Binary zeros, and Tails as ones, you can see that a "small binary number" would start with a lot of zeros.)
@_date: 2013-03-26 12:25:45
Excellent suggestions.  I mention "SHA256(passphrase)" in my instructions, which is well documented and available in other places other than bitaddress.org.  There are several computer science people in my family that could figure that out, in the event that bitaddress.org is out of business or changed.
It's hard to "future proof" this stuff.  And even though my bitcoin wallet only contains a relatively small amount now, some day this could be worth big bucks.
I'm trying to keep this down to one page of primary instructions that can be held in 4 or 5 places, but I'll probably also have complete detailed instructions in one place (with screen shots, source code listings, etc).

OK, I hate to be dense, and I appreciate your explanation.  I just have a few more questions.
I know that a private key leads to only one public key.  But is the bitcoin address that public key?  (I thought the bitcoin address was a hash of the public key, or derived from it in some way.)  
The reason I didn't think that the bitcoin address was the public key is because I would think that the public and private key would be approximately the same length, and the private key is always much longer than a bitcoin address.

@_date: 2013-04-25 18:44:33
Not sure why you were voted down, but this is the correct answer.
In fact, the adjustment isn't complete at 2016 blocks, since there's some averaging and smoothing done, so it doesn't jump all over the place.  That means that in the medium term, blocks will be confirmed faster.
The only other point I'd make is that the Question referred to transaction verification, and technically this should be confirmation.  Transactions can be verified instantly (meaning that their validity as a transaction is sound), but the confirmation process (meaning that it's not a double spend) is what takes a while.
@_date: 2013-07-18 14:25:52
Using the same logic, Dollars do not function as money.
Point 1:  Certainly dollars are used *much more* than Bitcoin an an intermediary of trade, but they are not used universally.  So they are either saying that Bitcoin is not used as an intermediary for trade (which they contradict later on the slide, when they say "hardly"), or there's a magical line somewhere between the amount that Bitcoin is used for transactions and the amount that Dollars are used for transactions.
Point 2.  Act as a standard numerical unit for the measurement of value.  Dollars and bitcoins are used this way for limited amounts of time.  Dollars are not used as a standard numerical unit for long periods of time (because merchants change the price of milk and eggs all the time). The only 2 things that dollars are a standard numerical unit for are other denominations (like a ten dollar bill = 10 one dollar bills) and taxes (which is not insignificant).  But my first earned dollar that I hung on the wall in 1974 does not measure value the same now as it did then.
Point 3.  Store of value.  Money can be stored now and retrieved later.  Again, this is as true with Bitcoins as Dollars.  Granted, the value fluctuates on both, and *much more* on Bitcoin, but bitcoins stored now are worth the same quantity of Bitcoins later, just like dollars are worth the same amount of dollars later (even though the value of BOTH changes).
I like the slides... they are favorable for Bitcoin.  But their conclusions are silly.

1) you don't want to have to bring too much online at one time.   So you should "tier" your could storage in different amounts.  Sort of like having 1's, 5's, 10's and 20's in your wallet.  
2)  I needed access at work to about $10,000 worth, and didn't have my cold storage handy.  In that case, I wish I would have had a brain-wallet method of accessing a few "denominations".
My new method is to use SHA_256(SHA_256(100+ character pass_phrase) &amp; sha_256(denomination and serial number))
That way, at work or in an emergency, I can relatively easily  bring online one of my cold storage wallets:  "10 BTC  for instance.  bitaddress helps me to quickly determine the private key.

Offer a cash delivery system in your city.
Anyone in the world can send cash to a friend in your city, through you.  You'll deliver it.  So you negotiate a deal with the remote person "You pay me in Bitcoins, and I'll deliver 98% of the spot value in dollars."  (You can try different percentages depending on market needs.)
Then, when it's agreed, you meet with the recipient, cell phone the sender, give the sender an exact Bitcoin amount and a Bitcoin address, and then you pay the cash to their friend.
So you have bought them for "under market" by providing a valuable service (a LOT cheaper than western union).

Don't spend all your money on it!  That's the first thing.  Remember, it's an experiment, and you can easily lose your entire investment.  Also, keep in mind that people have lost their entire investment without Bitcoin failing, simply due to poor security, thieves, companies going out of business, etc.
Ease into it.  Bitcoin is cool because you can get in for pennies or dollars.  You can sign up for Coinbase (U.S. only) and try it at $50 or $100.
Play with it.  move money around.  Make sure you understand how to use it securely.
Then explain Bitcoin from a "usage" perspective.  Don't try to explain mining and blockchain.  Explain how she can buy a pair of shoes online.  Explain the vision of sending value nearly  instantly to nearly anyone for nearly free.  Work on her from an "it's useful" angle.
Then look at investing in the currency.  And only invest what you are willing to lose.  Instead of going out to dinner and dropping $100, eat in, and invest that $100.  Then it won't feel like such a risk, and she won't panic on every little tick of the exchanges.

I'm no expert, but looking at what happened, it looks like this to me:
1.  He had a 100 bitcoins stored in a brain wallet, at address [1781pf...](
2.  He wanted to take 12 Bitcoins out of that wallet, so he fired up a PC to create the transaction, thinking he could extract out 12, but save his brain wallet for later use.  He used Multibit to do this.
3.  Multibit created [a transaction]( which pulled out the 12 BTC from the 100, and sent the remainder (88 BTC less fees) to [a new address]( for change.
4.  He then deleted all traces, to try to protect his Private Key of his brain wallet.  In doing so, he deleted the private key of the newly created change address, [1Bndi...](
Two things that I do differently.  
1.  I have your offline storage in wallets of varying sizes.  Sort of like having hundred-dollar bills, 50's, twenties, tens and fives.  When you want to spend some money, only cash out the one that is slightly bigger than the amount of money you need.  
2.  When you spend a paper wallet or brain wallet, spend it entirely.  I do this by creating a brand-new disposable wallet on Blockchain.info, and importing the key to my paper wallet, and then paying the partial sum to whomever I want to pay and then pay the rest to myself in another paper wallet.
If you have a favorite brainwallet phrase, and want to implement my step 1, you could do what I do, and suffix your brain wallet phrase with a denomination and counter.  For instance "super-secret-pass-phrase 10 BTC   Then if you need to spend the money, you can cash it in, using a combination of bitaddress.org (to re-generate the private key) and blockchain.info (to import the private key and spend the money).  
My biggest recommendation:  Once you spend something from cold storage, spend it ALL, and burn that private key, never to be used again.


It was a combination of not understanding the software, and then doing something wrong due to the misunderstanding.

I think it works for Pakistanis just like it works for everyone else!
If you have money in a brainwallet, you have a private key that is not stored in any online wallet.  This is very safe.
Say you have 100 Bitcoins in that brain wallet.  Now say you want to create a transaction that sends 1 Bitcoin to a friend's Bitcoin Address, and 99 Bitcoins back to the Brain wallet (less the fee).
You can go to that page, and unplug from the internet.  Then put in your private key (actually I think you can put in your pass phrase on another tab, generate the Private key, then paste it into that page), and then create a transaction offline that has all the information to spend the money as you want.  
Obviously this is manual and risky (if you forget to spend it all, the balance would go to the miners!)  Don't try it with large sums.
You create the transaction on that page.... and then copy it.  You can push a transaction into the Blockchain using several tools - Bitcoin-QT or blockchain.info 
You just need to paste the transaction into the above form once you are online, and it'll process. 
You can also press "send transaction" to send it directly from that page.
The cool thing about this page is that you can create very complex transactions (many inputs, many outputs).

Good idea.
You know, I have a version 1 Android phone that I am done using (and I imagine many people have these).  It will likely never be connected to the internet again.  It could be the dream wallet - not exactly a hardware wallet, but it could have the QR code display, sign transactions, and only send signed transactions over to my REAL phone (via headphone jack, or blue tooth (not NFC this time).  Possibly even a QR code (or 2 or 3) of the transaction, since QR codes can be over 1K.

It seems like you have it pretty accurately.   The set of transactions is a set of previously unconfirmed transactions.  The miner can basically choose any unconfirmed transactions that they want, and include them in the block.  They can base this choice on the level of fees, for instance.
"How are these recorded in the block?" -   The transactions contain "inputs" (who the money is from), "outputs" (the addresses that the money is to), and a signature from all input addresses (confirming that it really is OK to perform this transaction.  I think it also contains references to previous transactions which originally funded the input addresses.
If you are explaining it to friends, the TL;DR version is that mining is a bookkeeping function.
If you want to explain more, you can describe it like a multi-page spreadsheet, where each page is a block.  Each row contains a transaction, and each column represents a bitcoin address.  Each transaction (row) must have as much in non-zero entries debiting certain accounts as it has in crediting other accounts (and fees are what remains after the credits).  
The miners are "locking in a page", by tying it firmly to the previous page through a great deal of WORK (searching to find a good nonce).  
Mining is more like looking for a needle in haystack than it is encryption/decryption.

There could be a 51% attack being done offline right now.  A massive network of ASICs (much faster than the ones going on the market right now) could be building a parallel block chain with a higher difficulty.  It could be routing all coins mined since the last check point to the CIA in a "dark net" - a separate network that doesn't interface with the current clients.  And it could use the exact client and mining software that everyone else is using.
Then when the bad guys want to screw up the network, they simply connect their dark net to the internet, and thousands of transactions get reversed.
All those saying "it's mathematically impossible" for transactions to be reversed have their head in the clouds (or somewhere else).

One Bitcoin is one twenty-one-millionth of all Bitcoins that can be issued.  That's as concrete as you can make it.
In some ways, it's sort of like owning a share of stock.  You can say "what the heck is a share of stock?" and try to figure out if you bought a desk or a slice of a person, or what.  In the case of a share of stock, you are buying a portion of the company.  In the case of Bitcoin, you are buying a portion of all the Bitcoins that can be issued.
Your "account" contains a balance.  If it's 1 Bitcoin, then the number 1 is your balance.  You can have a fractional balance (like 0.05 Bitcoins), much like a mutual fund.
But really, seriously, don't think of "coins" and "mining".  That is a terrible analogy.  Think of a balance in a ledger (just like your bank account), and mining = bookkeeping.  The reward for mining is just pay for being a bookkeeper.

Yes and no.  The buyer *currently* has risk that the seller won't fulfill his part of the transaction.  The cost to the buyer now is equal to the hassle and cost of trying to recover spent funds, times the probability that the seller will let him down, PLUS the mark-up on the product because the seller must cover fraud-protection.
So yes, there's no free lunch, but Bitcoin reduces that fraud expense.  The buyer STILL has a cost of trying to recover his spent money for unfulfilled transactions, and the likelihood of full recovery from disreputable sellers is less.  But the likelihood of full recovery from a reputable seller is just as high.  
So all this means cheaper transactions for the buyer, when using reputable sellers.   
Not a free lunch, but a **substantially** cheaper lunch, when dealing with reputable sellers.

Technically, "forge a transaction" isn't an issue.  The individual transactions are secure, in that only the holder of a Private Key for a particular Bitcoin Address can sign a transaction spending the bitcoins to another address.
The forked block chain issue that I mentioned would really be an issue of trying to remove a transaction or add a different transaction to the Block Chain.  And the risk here is that the rogue miner would double-spend.  Here's how it could work:
Evil-Miner spends 100 Bitcoins to buy something cool online - a virtual good, like a download or something.  Evil-Miner pays the address 1ABC123... to pay for the goods.  The company waits for a single confirmation and ships the goods. 
Then Evil-Miner create a new block, spending the same money to his own address 1EviL123...  He quickly solves the block with his massive 51% power, and then convinces the rest of the network that his fork is better (based on the rules of "most work").
So Evil-Miner got to keep his Bitcoins and get the goods, due to a double-spend.
That's about as much damage as he can do.

How did you conclude this?  Is it because there CAN BE 4 times as many?  Because there AREN'T.  (19.9M vs. 11.482M, but who knows how many are lost.)
Or because there are 1/4th as many merchants?  Because there aren't.  (probably something like 500:1 in favor of Bitcoin)
Or because the security of the network is 1/4th as strong (meaning that a 51% attack would take 1/4th the cost)?  Because this isn't true.  (difficulty 31.3M vs 892, so a 35K:1 ratio, with ASICs and GPUs costing a fraction per GH)
You've tried to create a simple ratio, but it's far from that simple, even for the "market's eyes" as you say.  Any of the above stats can be factored in, and distort the simple 4:1 ratio, for a logical market participant - some upward, some downward.

I think that's an incorrect description (if I understand what this graph is truly showing) because a transaction with no fees could sit around for a long time, and another transaction could be confirmed seconds after submission.

I'm trying to decide if the two words start with "TL" or "DR".

Exemption is described in Footnote 19... almost at the end says:
19 FinCEN defines a "dealer in foreign exchange" as a "person that accepts the currency, or other monetary instruments, funds, or other instruments denominated in the currency, of one or more countries in exchange for the currency, or other monetary instruments, funds, or other instruments denominated in the currency, of one or more other countries in an amount greater than $1,000 for any other person on any day in one or more transactions, whether or not for same-day delivery."

He says he has a lot of safeguards in place.  I think he has a death switch in place.  
He could trust some of his top investors, with Shamir's Shared Secret.

More mining equals a more secure network, which tends to encourage confidence in the currency, which generally can help the price rise.

That's a prediction I can believe.  That 2013 will end with a bitcoin price between zero and 4038 or beyond.

Say you have 10 BTC on a paper wallet, and you want to spend say 0.05 BTC.  You could import the paper wallet into blockchain.info, and then spend the 0.05 BTC.  But then the change may be in a separate wallet.  You can look at the transaction and see exactly what happened, and what Bitcoin Address the money is in.
My preference at this point is to then pay the remainder to another paper wallet, and verify that it got there, then destroy the first paper wallet.  In fact, I would do this in a disposable blockchain.info account.  Once the money is where I want it to be, then you can burn the old paper wallet with the zero balance.  Just make sure no one sends you money to that bitcoin address ever again.

I'm with you there.  I used to race home from work to watch [Laurie Dhue]( I would just be mesmerized watching her lips as she delivered the news.
But I have given her up.  She never called...  she never wrote.  So it's over.
Edit:  [6 minutes of Dhue-ness](

I think a lot of people bailed when it jumped 3x.  But then it goes to 4x, and they don't want to miss the run-up, so they buy back in.  Bail at 6x. back in at 7x.  Bail at 10x.
Then they congratulate themselves at being such great day traders.

So you can transfer dollars to bitcoins on Mt Gox, send the bitcoins over to bitcoin-24, trade like a day trader for free for months.... and then someday (if there's any left, after all your foolish day trades), transfer back to Mt Gox and back into cash?

I think you are wrong on that.  Read [this procedure](

grubwithus must have changed.  They're now not in my city either (although I have already been to a grubwithus.com event, so that means they LEFT!)
I guess a nationwide rollout doesn't work so well...

Keep in mind, if you accept this kind of cash in the US, you are committing a felony (unless you are registered).
Could be a sting.  Could be a way to launder a briefcase full of money (which you may not be able to spend).  Could be a robbery waiting to happen (for which you cannot report, because you were committing a crime at the time).
OP, look to tradehill.com or coinlab.com.  Not an individual (in the US).
