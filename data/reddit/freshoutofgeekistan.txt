I am worried. A minimum income *could* be a first attempt at a solution, but it would be a stopgap measure. Most people need to work to have a meaningful, structured life.

Seriously, speaking as a female here, you need to get a new girlfriend. Cryptocurrency isn't intended or designed for this kind of subterfuge. Just find a girlfriend (I keep mistyping "girlfiend") that likes what you like. Don't use cryptocurrency for a problem that it is not intended for, then complain about how it doesn't work the way you want it to.

You are correct. This was announced back on Friday or Saturday, I just realized! See L.A.Times, 28 June 2014,  [Gov. Brown signs bills legalizing Bitcoins use, other legislation](

Nahh, I don't think so. I think they're mostly just sloppy. QZ was very positive about bitcoin in January through June 2014. I'm not that positive about bitcoin truly, but I really loathe overly simplified QZ and Vox articles about serious subjects. This is typically bad QZ.

I've tried to expand the Wikipedia BLP article for Nick Szabo, with no success ("No success" because I couldn't find any information that was beyond what others had already discussed and found wrong or not possible to resolve per the talk page).

It almost causes me physical pain to be speaking up in defense of bitcoin, but I am reminded of the growth of the automobile industry in the USA. There were several hundred auto manufacturers in the 1920s.  True, not all of them went out of business due to scams and fraud, unlike some (but not all) of the bigger name bitcoin company blowouts... 
I really like that graph, and would like to see one for bitcoin despite the presence of bad actors along the way.

Very good, Gwern! Yours is the first reddit or hnews comment to have picked up on that detail:

A bitcoin Stack Exchange has great potential, if done correctly and with a diverse mix of participants. I  agree with you, that really should be for news. Yet there is a real need for a moderated site where questions can be answered about bitcoin by people who have some or all of the knowledge required to respond to what is a complex topic. Yet  without ulterior motive (e.g. forum associated with a bitcoin clearinghouse would have conflict of interest.  I think...), nor blatant anti-bitcoin bias either. 
I like (certain aspects) of Stack Exchange a lot. The users are, in general, great. If the bitcoin Stack Exchange site makes it out of public beta, even if it stays in public beta but thrives, a sidebar link from here is worth consideration.
* I smiled when I read your comment. Praise works wonders on me, every single time... sigh. I'm so shallow and predictable.

No need to apologize to me, I should have said sorry to you. ;
I was embarrassed at not doing a better job of checking my work, so to speak. So I got indignant and ranted at you, and Reddit. I'm guessing that Reddit (and a lot of AWS and other cloud providers) are under heavy load lately. Shouldn't make a difference but things DO get wonky in odd ways when systems are stressed.

This is a news story with today's date, but it seems to be a rehash of a [Reuters article, posted on from June 2011, plus a photo lifted from the [Casascius]( website. (Plus the Reuters article didn't get all the facts quite right, [this]( was the root cause, rather than government concern about Bitcoins per se). What am I missing here? I was OP. 
Do y'all think this is just a slow day at C-Net and that's why they published this now? Because nothing new seems to be going on, as far as I can tell...

Wow, Admin Theymos liked your suggestion! I see the Bitcoin Stack Exchange link in the sidebar. Nicely done!
@_date: 2011-10-31 04:12:43
Once the bitcoin Stack Exchange site achieves full status, it might make sense to include a link to the site in the right hand sidebar. Although, then one could make a point that EVERY sub-reddit with a Stack Exchange counterpart should have the same treatment... Urk, complicated!
Well anyway, I think that is a good idea, turtoise, although I have no idea how to implement it other than on an ad hoc basis (which might be sufficient)!

You didn't ask me, but I was a trader, awhile ago. I traded US Treasury futures and options-on-futures for a small hedge fund and a big Japanese bank. jimhsu is correct, but if you are comfortable with calculus, that might be an easier way to think of the financial Greeks. That's how I think of them, and remember the difference between them.
Delta is first derivative of asset price with respect to price of the underlying security.
Gamma is the second derivative of asset price with respect to price of the underlying security.
Theta is the first derivative of asset price with respect to time.
Delta, theta and gamma all refer to options, or things that behave like options e.g. warrants or anything else with embedded optionality as Taleb might say. jimhsu is also correct in saying that other Greeks are not so relevant here, and are more difficult to explain. That includes vega.
Vega measures the impact of changes in the underlying volatility on the option price. So vega is the first derivative of the option price with respect to volatility of the underlying security.

I don't know what's going on with Reddit. Not only didn't I see THAT one, but there's a third one as well! Each are in different sub-Reddit's, mine is the only one in Bitcoin, but that should not matter. Reddit will flag duplicates (or wanna-be triplicates) wherever they are. I hate seeing multiple entries for the same link.
Why didn't the others submit to bitcoin I wonder? Is there any way I could delete my submission and replace it with the earliest of the other two submissions in the bitcoin area here, do you know?
@_date: 2011-06-23 15:22:09
The article was really sketchy on the details, yes. Referring to the person as an "IT worker" or "IT staffer": That is vague. I realize SMH.com.au isn't a tech publication, but a slightly more specific job title would have been nice.
And as you said, there are many subtle ways an employee with sysadmin rights could have done this. Though whether with finesse or not, it is short term thinking to jeopardize a good job at ABC in the IT dept just to mine bitcoins at work.

That is *exactly* how I see it. Most complex and even some not-so-complex systems are vulnerable to this effect. If Bitcoin ecosystem participants are primarily unselfish (which is not equivalent to generous!) the ecosystem will survive. Even if a few pools are selfish, the system can endure. It really isn't surprising that Bitcoin would have such vulnerabilities, though the hope had been ~~that it didn't~~ that collusion would need to be much greater in magnitude (51%?) to compromise the entire system.
Also, note the authors' claims that this affects all crypto currencies "based on" bitcoin blockchain. I haven't read any commentary about that yet.

Wait. "Quasi-commodity" currencies? What do you mean by that? There are agricultural commodities as well as metals, petrochemicals (the most well-known being oil) and so forth. Gold is a commodity with no different status than any other that trades on the London Metals Exchange. Gold coins are a separate matter, whether bullion i.e. fungible or with numismatic value. Currency, on the other hand, is not a commodity per se. Foreign exchange futures and options-on-futures are traded on commodities exchanges, but are known as financial futures. I mention all of this because I don't see any inconsistency between the current definition for a commodity and Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin shouldn't be a commodity. The U.S. Dollar is not a commodity, nor is any other currency that is used for financial transactions a commodity. No one uses gold for financial transactions unless in extreme situations or under duress. 
I looked at the OP, but didn't click the link(s?) provided by Smiling Dave. Was he referring to less liquid currencies e.g. with less trading volume but trusted like the Scandinavian currencies, or to pegged exchange rate currencies like the yuan a.k.a. RenMinBi? Am I missing something entirely here?
