There are no positives,  and there are no users of it so no one needs to know anything. It was a huge waste of time and is still technologically behind the capabilities of many shitcoins. It is not useful to corporations, companies, or anyone looking to transact with bitcoin.

There must be something in the beard oil. Someone has to do a study, too many correlations.

I cant wait until there are only a few hundred idiot "HODLERS" left and bitcoin is back under $100. It should be an interesting couple of weeks watching it get there.

No you arent

You guys have jokes. We will see who will be the last one laughing.

I invented reddit gold. I cannot prove it but I would accept the gold from you, torchbearer.

Did u just hear the buzzword "shilling" and decide to try and use it in a sentence without finding out what it means? Or did u not understand the sarcasm in my comment? Either way, the jokes on you.

Lightning  Network is kicking the can at best. After years of development they roll out an unusable product that will not help gaining any adoption. LN is a fucking joke.

As a fellow aussie, I appreciate your image. Would you like to join me in a Scotch drinking contest?
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:21:54
Not yet, hold my beer
@_date: 2018-11-22 11:27:29
I'm sure many things do. Like the thought of being heterosexual, for example...
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:52:30
Oh great, another one who doesn't believe I'm a Dr. What kind of proof is it going to take? A wheelbarrow full of universities? 
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:38:39
THE FLIPPENING IS UNDER WAY BOYS! ARE YOU ON THE ROCKET?
@_date: 2018-11-22 10:56:17
I'm still in bed with your mother. Please bring me a scotch. Knock first.

Care for a scotch ?

In the spirit of answering questions with questions with questions with questions....  What's the point of it?

In the next few weeks, what do you anticipate happening that will be more exciting than watching a bunch of idiots who are in it "FOR THE TECH" or is it the "MOON" lose their shit. This ponzi scheme made Bernie Madoff blush. Watching the air come out of this balloon is poetry in motion.
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:52:25
I have to agree with you
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:29:22
There will still be 2 or 3 neckbeards playing with all of them, safely from their mothers basement. This will prevent it from being 0. But goddamnit its gonna be close!
@_date: 2018-11-28 10:00:32
Yeah man definitely back in business! Year long bear market is over, you heard it here first from the wolfmaster. This couldn't possibly just be another bounce

@_date: 2018-11-21 08:57:35
Does it make you feel better when you let everyone else know? 
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:17:55
Welcome home
@_date: 2018-11-28 12:27:29
Are you shilling me right now?
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:03:25
But I thought so highly of you sir...
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:47:46
The bcash community was the first to ban me, obviously.
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:11:19
Idk about you but my fridge is full of leftovers. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:37:08
That means a lot coming from you, being that you know a thing or two about bottom of the barrel comments. Mr. 1 Karma . 
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:03:45
Their mod logs are  public and u can see for yourself that they ban hundreds of users weekly. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 11:15:16
That's mighty Canadian of you, but I do not accept the apology you made on behalf of your people.
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:38:27
Get BAKKT Mother F&amp;%ker you don't know me like that
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:04:17
Well, it doesn't work. You could say.... you have no idea how Lightning Network \*doesn't work\*
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:30:33
Probably anyone. You are one of the last few people on earth who want bitcoin. People would give you their bitcoins for just about anything
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:56:28
BTC has the nerve to challenge BTC SATOSHIS VISION.
