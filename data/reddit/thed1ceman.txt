I had e mails from xapo as well as wavecrest (this one landed in junkmail) stating that my xapo card has been cancelled. so it's true unfortunately:(

segwit is stopping segwit.

This is one of the dumbest posts i have ever seen. OP clearly doesn't understand what freedom of speech means if he compares people that don't share his opinion with pedophiles.
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:21:31
body language says it all, this crook is lying trough his teeth
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:58:16
if nearly everyone would support segwit it would be activated by now. stop with this narrative please, it is just plain wrong.

what? i've been using bitcoin since late 2012 and never ran a node. since then i paid and got paid in btc and my investment grew steadily. which benefits did i miss?
@_date: 2016-01-04 19:19:59
how great is that?!! any plans to roll this out in Switzerland?

and except a lot of users wheter you like it or not.

Many people in the other sub told the user that spamming people is a terrible idea and he shouldn't do it. Too bad he didn't listen. I remember how pissed off I was when I was getting several "forget BTC buy ETH" PM's a while back.
@_date: 2017-03-05 07:42:52
i see your point. however that doesn't make luke's statement in regards to the benefits true. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:57:53
Oh the burn, ha ha!
@_date: 2017-01-27 08:29:05
he can't be serious with that, right??!

I am currently travelling in SEA and i am using BTC to fund my travel. I use my Xapo card to get fiat and when possible BTC to pay for flights.  
Unfortunately no brick and mortar shops accept BTC directly where I am at right now.  
ps: Thanks to the soaring price I have more money than when I started ;-) Heck, i might never go back home!

miners don't want segwit, this is very clear by now
@_date: 2017-08-31 02:09:17
what sites are you playing at? And how would you rate the skills of the players compared to traditional sites like pokerstars etc?
@_date: 2017-01-27 13:32:35
does that mean they are planning to dump those coins? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 04:22:08
Thanks, will have a look at those sites
@_date: 2016-11-11 10:13:11
I think its 6%

He is one of the most important figures in the BTC eco-system. We are lucky to have him
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:24:26
buy the house on your own/with the bank and use BTC for everyday spending like groceries, nights out (aka hookers and cocaine)
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:35:34
Except bitcoin has done the same thing over and over again in the last few years.
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:28:10
this is nothing new, you can do that since a few months already

Serious questions: why is there no price jump if this is so bullish?
