escalated likelihood of regulatory actions on exchanges. Allowing BitConnect to trade was bad enough. If Tether is fake then it might change tone of US regulators for the worse. That might cause volume to dry up, exchanges to shut down etc.

Here we go ...

Also isn’t the fact Tether is one of the best performing coins today bullish? If there’s massive selling action and the best it can do is .99 that seems indicative that there are strong hands and the whole reason market is down because FUD theory bitfinex is weak hands 
I remember when I saw 5b$ of volume on coinmarketcap at 1.06 thinking that bitfinex must be minting. That’s $300m of pnl in 1 day

Is it just me, or is the fact Samsung making mining hardware very bullish because they know the inside scoop on Korean policy, and would not enter this business if there was a hard ban?

If China were really cracking down hard on Bitcoin, wouldn't NEO be performing worse than Bitcoin?

Yea I guess I was referring to the outperformance of Neo versus bitcoin being a piece of evidence Asia fears overblown. Always looking for positive signs out of Asia because could drive market bounce — Thinking out loud, my view of what happened was:
1) whale profit taking at $20k - liquidity went parabolic so why not - whenever there are concentrated holders who are suddenly billionaires I figure some profit taking 
2) retail investors had chased the move higher, borrowed money long at 18k is “weak hands” 
3) futures market gave hedge funds a reason to push the short trade and CNBC got on the train as they tend to w institutional flow 
4) there is something fishy in South Korea. My guess is that there was some engineering of a dip
5) that took the knees out and BitConnect imploding definitely heightens risk of SEC action. Find it somewhat shocking Clayton was focused on Long Blockchain and the law firms and not BitConnect/ dicey ICOs
6) market has traded like crap despite lightning and Davos. Whales have to know lightning is key and they’re not buying the dip. smart people like Hoskinson spreading some regulatory FUD so it’s hard to get leveraged long without a clear catalyst
7) usdcny going down fast, and oil higher so the two big capital flight markets (China and Middle East) probably not in a hurry to put it all in bitcoin 
Thinking what could drive animal spirits again, big NEO outperformance, Baidu blockchain, alibaba rumors all feel like the market could get surprised by Chinese government coming out and saying something pro cryptocurrency. Or Korea regulatory concerns getting firmly dismissed 
Just exploring the idea looking for some positivity to add

Cool - thank you for the response. So the economics are basically turning all nodes into implicit banks that receive some kind of yield in exchange for underwriting security risk and power costs?

Thank you for the link, reading through it this part scared me:
"Online Lightning Network nodes require access to the unencrypted private keys used to manage their payment channels. This includes the Bitcoin private keys used to commit funds."
Wouldn't the potential security holes here prevent adoption? (sorry I'm a newbie trying to ramp up)

Thank you for the color -- very helpful, yes -- definitely interesting how much volume they do given the above.

Ameritrade has 1.5x the margin requirement of the exchange - ideally would want the same margin requirement or someone willing to do less

market has been so heavy on so much good news, what do the whales know?

People who are so confident this will go to $3k, you know there's a futures market? Go short it. Downside $1,000, upside $100k great risk reward! Bitcoin is for people who don't trust government with money. The one lesson of the last 10 years (and potentially of the 21rst century) is that fascist and communist regimes don't protect property. They have more wealth than they ever had, more billionaires than they've ever had. The global banking system has never colluded more to ensure they can't store their value. Lightning and Decentralized Exchanges are coming. Market technicals are impossible to predict. The point of HODL is to acknowledge you're not a day trader and take a long term view on value.

Thanks for the tips, Rootstock looks pretty cool but then I dug into it and couldn't find any projects that have been built on it yet. Is there a list of tokens built ontop of Bitcoin?
