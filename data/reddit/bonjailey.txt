This is an extra phone. Keep it off wifi and just power it.
@_date: 2019-07-10 06:03:38
I’ve been on both sides but never sold. Bought at around 8900 and then also at around your 12000 amount when I saw the crazy growth and got a late fomo. Never sold, and I don’t plan to. The point is stacking those sats.
@_date: 2019-07-01 02:03:16
Happening in a few countries already brother. Look at Venezuela or Zimbabwe. Us debt is above 23 trillion. I’m not smart enough to make a timeline, but it’s going to happen. System is flawed.

@_date: 2019-07-01 12:18:21
Can’t just turn it on to wifi and update when you want it to and turn it offline when you want it to?
@_date: 2019-07-08 17:51:43
It will go up at some point. Mark my words...
@_date: 2019-07-01 12:32:13
Appreciate it. Didn’t appreciate the “idiot.”Haha but glad I learned. In my brain it seemed viable, but I’m pretty new...So I appreciate your candor and expertise. Thanks for your time good sir
@_date: 2019-07-02 20:59:28
I hate how many snakes are in this world. Waste of space
@_date: 2019-07-01 02:27:43
Yeah for sure. I can just see it happening more and more in the future. And hopefully that leads to adoption of bitcoin on a grander scale.
@_date: 2019-07-22 17:45:40
Is it possible they are actually using them to protect customers like the end of the article says? Or are they just giving us the runaround

@_date: 2019-07-01 11:15:05
Is it a good idea to use a wallet on a phone, and completely disconnect it from the internet and use that as cold storage? Or am I an idiot
@_date: 2019-07-10 06:08:00
I agree my knowledge of it economically, far exceeds my knowledge of it technically or technologically. That being said, I still don’t trust what I know economically. I will buy when I can, and hodl. I will keep studying and reading, but may never truly understand it as a whole.
@_date: 2019-07-01 22:08:37
Yeah that’s what happened. Weird
@_date: 2019-11-18 08:08:05
Prove it.
@_date: 2019-11-26 01:59:44
I’ll play your game. I’ve often wondered when I was drunk if China is creating all of this nonsense and banning while they secretly buy or mine it all up themselves. Taking away more liberties from their citizens and buying cheaper now for a bigger gain in the future

If you have other questions just dm me.
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:24:16
Your 78 went to 64 because of the price dropping. You own a fraction of a bitcoin. When bitcoins price overall goes up, the fraction you have will increase with it. No one knows what will happen when. It’s all speculation. Hodl on.

Appreciate this. Not only not confrontational, but actually informative. Hate how people are hoping for mass adoption, and acting like pricks when a question is asked. Hope all works out brother. All the best.
@_date: 2019-10-25 23:11:12
I see everyone’s been helpful already. So may I ask what job or what service you’re providing to get paid 1 Btc monthly? And may I attain this job as well haha (I understand you’re need for privacy, so I understand this will most likely not get an actual answer)
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:43:34
I do
@_date: 2019-08-18 09:46:00
Your frustration might be warranted. But instead of giving me reasons to second guess myself, just inform or help. I reached out, I’m curious.

@_date: 2019-10-13 22:53:27
Did you just learn the word intrinsic? Or is this a joke
@_date: 2019-08-16 20:42:41
A wallet is where you store the coins you’ve accumulated through mining (which is very difficult now and not very financially responsible) or from purchasing through an exchange, and the keys are the phrases of words that protect your wallet. Generally speaking it’s 24 words that mean nothing in a sentence but provide you with a password. They are for you and you only. Most wallets provide you with the key. Write down the words it gives you in the correct order and stash it somewhere safe. If you’re crazy like me. You’ll write down false keys and store those in places to throw people off of your scent. (Anyone breaking into my house would have to understand bitcoin and seed phrases to even fathom what the nonsense means. So there’s a 0.0000001 chance that will ever happen haha) that’s a very general explanation of it. I would do a google search and read for yourself and do that as many times as it may take to fully grasp the concept. Or watch YouTube videos if you’re a visual learner.

@_date: 2019-08-28 08:13:02
Saw this in the daily discussion. Have to agree it’s very sad to read some posts and comments. I’ve also been persecuted for asking questions. I do believe everyone could be a bit more accepting and courteous, but I feel the “I’m right, you’re wrong” aspect has taken over. I have no problem with people getting to this first...but just because it took myself or anyone else longer, does not mean we’re stupid or inadequate.
@_date: 2019-10-25 15:53:03
Ugh. I was going to buy more before bed. Woke up to this:(
@_date: 2019-08-18 09:16:01
Appreciate your comment. Very helpful. Hope you find happiness and success.
@_date: 2019-08-16 01:38:48
Hope the best for you brother.
@_date: 2019-08-16 20:19:10
Start here, Do your own research, and make your own decisions. Don’t listen to everything you hear, people always have their own agenda. For me personally, I plan to hold. Get your own wallet with your own keys. Not your keys, not your coins. (You’ll year that often) Hopefully some smarter people than myself will help and give you a better explanation. Good luck brother.
@_date: 2019-08-27 09:15:55
What makes it the best in your opinion?

No worries mate

I hear this a lot and I really hope that’s the case. Trying to stack sats without feeling bad if I lose the money I put in.

Yeah I’m definitely not a tech nerd. I understand the basics of Linux, but even that might be an overstatement haha
@_date: 2019-10-03 00:10:55
It was 0.003 March 2010. Before that it was virtually nothing. I think among exchanges you may be right that 0.08 was the lowest. But it definitely was worth less in the beginning when it was traded between cryptographers.
@_date: 2019-10-28 05:35:05
Finally TA I can get behind
@_date: 2019-10-03 00:41:41
Yeah the comments were mostly about people wishing they could go back in time to get rich, not thinking about the future. I was more so excited about all the people reading the comments and possibly starting to google and research more about bitcoin and blockchain technology
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:33:42
Oh wow. Well hopefully it works out for you!
@_date: 2019-10-26 23:25:24

Coinbase wallet

Yeah I once waited a day or two for something I transferred. So scary. But there’s light at the end of the tunnel brother.

From the app to the wallet. Both iOS apps

The picture is 16 million
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:14:04
Yes. I tried to send bitcoin from the coinbase exchange to the wallet they recommended. Which they said was linked to my account
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:10:56
I thought it was going to be two weeks from now, from what I saw in the past. But it’s not an exact science. Hodl on

Coinbase Wallet by Toshi 
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:24:52
That’s all well and good. I understand I’m not educated enough, but what do I do about the money sent? It was supposed to go straight from the exchange to the wallet they provided. I have 36 confirmations saying it was sent. The address is correct, and no money.
@_date: 2019-10-26 09:17:03
Don’t get the negativity. Showed him, and multiple people how it can be applied, and proved a way it can be simple. If this is the applications for it now, I can’t wait for the future.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:57:25
Which way is your clue pointing?
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:13:52
I bought the bitcoin on the coinbase exchange app. But I was told I needed to put it in a wallet. So I downloaded the coinbase wallet app and linked the two. There was a button in the wallet app that said transfer, and I clicked that and it brought up my coinbase app account. So I set things in motion and now neither have my money. But it shows a history of it being sent between the two
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:04:16
Haha true
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:08:39
In the app it says bc1qnuh5z2saqm4zfmlhe4m60y36uf599k5vl4xjpd
But I’ve been told this isn’t an actual code. So is coinbase just stealing from me?
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:30:17
That’s Canadian
@_date: 2019-10-26 11:33:57
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:42:48
I sent the bitcoin from the coinbase app to the coinbase wallet, and I have confirmation emails saying that the coins were sent to a big long number and letter code, and when I open the wallet, it’s the same code as my barcode picture. It’s an iOS wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-15 02:09:34
Any press is good press though right? (I’m still new to this)
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:47:20
I clicked on this and I’m not upset.
@_date: 2019-10-28 20:19:23
I usually get the “it’s made up and nothing backs it” response
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:58:59
What’s my fastest way out of coinbase? In a similar situation with this other young fella
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:18:46
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:17:23
It is yeah
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:43:17
I have emails saying complete? I sent them at 4 or 5 in the morning.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:38:31
Purchase what you can, what you’re not afraid to lose. Whether it’s $20 a week or a larger sum up front. We are on a ride now and it’s not always about that. It’s about accumulating sats (satoshis) for when they hopefully (inevitably) become valued close to what fiat considers a dollar, or even less. I too over think everything. I understand the stress, and it’s hard to look back to the past and say would’ve, should’ve, could’ve. I’d say buy in now with what you can, but it’s always your decision at the end. It never hurts to have a percentage of your investments into something else as a backup plan
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:14:25
What happens if I share it?
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:56:08
I used the coinbase wallet app. Pretty straight forward. Had one issue originally, but they corrected it.
@_date: 2019-06-24 06:32:21
I don’t know much either brother. But I can say watching a lot of the videos in this sub has helped. I feel like I know about %50 of the idea haha but my $550 turned to $829 real quick with their help. Doesn’t seem like much, but I’ve only hodled (as they say) for so long. coinbase is an easy exchange or Gemini to start. Get a good wallet, best is away from any internet. And if you don’t have a wallet, the money is not actually yours (because people can steal it) that’s my best interpretation at 2:31am and a night out with friends. I’m sure there’s smarter people that will help and elaborate
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:23:28
$700 only got me 0.05 btc so I would hope so haha
@_date: 2019-06-12 05:23:13

Think a satoshi  will ever equal a dollar? (That’s the dream right?)
@_date: 2019-06-18 00:11:32
I did. Everything was sent finally. Just not sure I can trust the app anymore.
@_date: 2019-06-30 10:19:59
I wish there was a way to watch this 10 years ago
@_date: 2019-12-31 10:15:21
Has anyone priced in inflation of the borrowed money? I may sound stupid here but wouldn’t that also increase the price of bitcoin? Or at least the worth of what is already owned.
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:21:21
Yeah I did. And I downloaded it from the App Store. �� but I haven’t had a response from them. It’s very strange.
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:45:51
I did. But it did the same thing when I restored
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:29:38
Well any help would be appreciated. I can’t learn if people just keep telling me I need to learn.
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:11:40
Actually I think I found the address it was sent to, but I don’t have a wallet with that address
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:40:56
I saw a video that mentioned it combatting inflation and I can’t remember the other point right now...
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:11:06
Where would I find the public key?

@_date: 2019-09-25 00:17:29
I think so many people bought into bakkt earlier this year and the price of bitcoin was maybe a bit higher than it should’ve been. Once bakkt had a somewhat poor showing, people sold on the news and thus created the correction. I could also be completely wrong and an idiot.
@_date: 2019-09-12 16:36:34

Always buy. But not more than you can afford to lose. Not my advice, never my advice, but I’ve never lost by doing this. I’m also ready to accept my fate if I do.

Honestly appreciate this so much.
@_date: 2019-05-12 23:10:14
Yeah I guess it’s been a while. Before I used to have to wait up to two weeks for transfers? Trying to get back into things before the next wave. I’ve googled a few fees but I can’t tell what’s right and what’s bull. I’m not the best with all of this
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:06:39
I’m just wondering about fees. And I know some take longer to transfer.
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:07:36
Brilliant haha. But I’m also Canadian and trying to save on possible fees and transfer times.
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:41:15
I’ll check them out, I’ve been using megafolds!
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:01:29
Do you have a preferred wallet?
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:08:53
Do you use the USB? Store everything offline?
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:37:55
I know this is a bit of topic. But Coinbase is a trusted way to buy bitcoin yes? I’ve gotten worried seeing so many ads lately
