Nothing, they will have some new rules, but that's good.

Cut in supply will raise the price.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:24:28
Yea, evrybody wants to have bitcoin, but there ain't much, so grasp sum while you can.
@_date: 2018-08-28 19:37:34
Since the supply is limited, and demand is not, we'll see price increases. Scams and fake news can reduce demand of course.
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:52:49
There will be new forks. Too lucrative. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:48:00
All speculation works this way. And for btc there's also demand, we all simply want it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:00:25
Yes could be, it is a bit after all. But some positive news might turn the trend.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:24:19
500 $ is the traditional believer valuation.
@_date: 2018-07-25 05:47:26
Bull sees no limits, fear still out of sight.
@_date: 2017-07-11 19:19:20
Sure, since the rise is based on nothing. There's no value in a bit. And if bits need to be money, one could set a standard one bit = one penny and stick to that.

No there are many currencies with fixed exchange rates, here for example those which are pegged to the dollar: 
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:45:17
So I get two coins out of one original, and the other is propably not valuable.
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:52:52
No there is no risk whatsoever. The fundamentals are clear and strong. And these extreme price changes won't happen anymore.
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:36:49
There's no need for a value of a currency to fluctuate. And for gambling or investments there are plenty of other options.
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:40:33
That's a prudent plan. All's coming down. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:53:26
Yes, they are not created the same way as normal currencies, but solutions could be found.

Thanks mate for your thoughtful words but in times of hodl crisis some things crash and others don't. Usually things like precious metals don't.
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:47:57
What happens to bitcoins already bought? Will they stay valuable?
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:08:53
Nothing but gut feeling and some experience from asset bubbles. You can't predict these, that's why I wrote 'I believe'.
@_date: 2017-07-27 06:40:34
Teh speculator may become dead if he hodls.
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:03:34
The ledger is not worth that much, let's say 10 pennies. Like the value of a metal in a normal coin. We could choose that level for the non-fluctuating price of bitcoin. What comes to inflation, one could use more bitcoins to buy the candy. Like now you have to buy the candy with a nickel or instead use more pennies.

Translated the term from Finnish "ääliöralli", but should have known that - of course - it originally was translated from English "Sucker's rally", :P

Yes I am new and didn't know about the gold backed crypto. My point is that a these speculations are not needed for a currency and these fluctuations are harmful for the whole cryptocurrency thing. And yes it doesn't have be gold backed. A currency basket of world's leading currencies would do as well.
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:54:28
There's no real value in bitcoin. If you try to trade it back to gold or silver you don't get nothing!
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:12:13




ok, tnks

A central authority could circulate enough copies of newly created coins in the blockchain to keep their price from rising. And the stores would accept only these authorized copies.
@_date: 2017-07-13 20:46:40
I know, but things may change in the long run.
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:54:41
The speed of the fall and experience from negative cycles were all I was thinking and didn't consider splits.
@_date: 2017-07-11 08:42:38
Never grip a falling knife. Nor crypto.
@_date: 2017-07-13 20:12:01
Yes, the value would not necessarily have to be tied to gold. It could be in line with a currency basket for example. Thanks for the note, so no inflation because of strong dollar.
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:59:09
I wouldn't buy.
