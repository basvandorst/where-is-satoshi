Bitcoin isn't real currency, it's just zeros and ones... or something. See, I can have ignorant opinions too :)

Ignore me if this question is a bit ignorant, but why not just buy $5k worth in one hit? Is it a matter of spreading the spend due to limited funds or is there more strategy to it than this?Edit- nevermind, just re-read your post and now understand :P

[i knew i'd seen something like this somewhere!]( not sure if they're from the same mob. 
no idea of legitimacy, but interesting nonetheless.

For me it's a little off-putting. I completely understand that these tips are what keeps you running, but it feels a bit last minute "quick, gotta ask for tips" and it breaks the flow between this article,the interaction with your audience and other content.
I like what you've done with the "Enjoy this article" text off to the side. Perhaps if the QR code was scaled down and sitting underneath that. For example the way Reddit's homepage is set out is quite good. All the content is there, unbroken, but off to the side you can buy Reddit gold. It's not salesy, it doesn't feel desperate, it's more of a "oh by the way, you can help us out here, no pressure though".
I have no experience with podcasts and bitcoin, so take my thoughts with a grain of salt.

Ugh. This reads like a buzzfeed clickbait article. Less speculation, more objective journalism, please.

Searched for "bitcoin begging" and BOOM! here I am in the past.
