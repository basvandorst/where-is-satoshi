Thanks Stunna, always have appreciated your support.
@_date: 2014-08-15 18:07:01
Hi, we are sorry for the inconvenience. Please try to click the refresh button. It's supposed to only need 1 confirmation. Thanks for reporting! We'll try to fix this as soon as possible.
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:16:16
Cheers and thanks for trying it out! Yeah, the units thing... We're waiting to see if people are actually settled on "bits" as the standard unit or not. If it's still up for debate, then we'll probably add it in. We'd rather have one though, for simplicity's sake.
@_date: 2014-01-31 09:18:59
We have already had the translation reviewed perhaps you can check it again if the translation is better?
@_date: 2014-07-21 04:24:01
Who said that specifically?
@_date: 2014-06-24 23:39:25
When the submission is done, absolutely.
@_date: 2014-06-25 11:25:08
Hopefully soon. ;-)
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:34:19
You _set_ one, correct?
@_date: 2014-07-26 09:08:23
Well, there are very few pools. Gaining influence over them would not be terribly difficult for a funded team highly focused on this effort. For all we know, they are reasonably co-opted already. We really know so little about them.
Anyway, once you have miner support, it becomes difficult to 'maintain your fork' if it goes against consensus, because in PoW, hashing power is super important. Sure, you can create another network, but you'll lose the advantages and value you had in the first place.
Remember, there are ~7000 full nodes online and the number seems only to be dropping. It would take quite an organizational/PR effort to prevent them from "upgrading".
We're fairly confident that this is all being worked out behind the scenes now.
@_date: 2014-08-09 10:37:17
As a group considering using Locks, we came here to say this exact thing.
@_date: 2014-07-25 06:46:07
Here's a tool that might be useful:
@_date: 2014-08-14 14:34:16
Well that _definitely_ shouldn't be. What device and OS are you using? We'll look into it, thanks for the report.
@_date: 2014-07-10 01:16:35
Pure propaganda. Making it mainstream while not compromising on those things simply takes enormous _work_, which is largely incompatible with highly competitive startup timeframes and the desire of said startups to defensively centralize.
@_date: 2014-08-14 12:50:00
As we always says, only if we find great Desktop Windows and Linux developers who want to do it!
@_date: 2014-07-23 06:33:40
Other than pointing me to Gresham's law, is there any proof of this?
@_date: 2014-07-06 11:37:52
Invested most of ours into making new Bitcoin software. :-)
@_date: 2014-07-06 20:02:29
Only slightly less tasteless than the golden girls at the Miami convention.
@_date: 2014-07-08 11:24:35
To be clear, there was actually no anti-bank sentiment in the statement. The word was used because 'counterparty' is far less widely understood.
Anyway, these actually are really good points. You're quite about the semantics, though whenever there are new things it's always up to those forging the path to create (and possibly maintain) the language. "Wallet" meant something different just a few years ago and we're of the opinion that this distinction should not be forgotten.
You definitely get an upvote from us for bursting the bubble of the hive mind (yeah, yeah, sorry) and provoking thoughtful discussion though. Kudos.
@_date: 2014-10-07 00:53:23
The post and topic have very little to do with the "money" use.
@_date: 2014-07-25 04:17:18
Let's be specific about how power can undermine an open source project like this: Since the protocol can really only go in one direction and still be compatible, interested parties just need to control the master branch of the particular fork that most people (and miners) use.
This is why it is extraordinarily important to pay extremely close attention to the core developers, including having a clear understanding of who works for who, and so on.
@_date: 2014-06-20 00:31:06
GitHub. :)
@_date: 2014-07-18 06:20:12
Anyone even remotely interested in this industry should read Tim Wu's "The Master Switch". It pretty much lays out the historical blueprint for what is going on here.
@_date: 2014-07-07 07:19:09
The Miami conference was a real shift in my perceptions at least. You could feel it. Suddenly it's MONEY MONEY MONEY. Par for the course, I'd say.
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:06:44
So much this.
@_date: 2014-07-25 07:30:37
Troll please.
@_date: 2014-07-26 08:54:23
All very well said Bruce, nice job and we applaud the bravery.
@_date: 2014-08-16 15:42:20
Hi, you can check our discussions about token prioritization here : 
@_date: 2014-08-14 12:50:57
Thanks for the feedback Ben.
@_date: 2014-07-08 13:17:06
Really, 'thought it just illustrated that Charlie Lee is a very generous guy...
Anyway, thanks for reminding everyone of one important fact: Hive is beta software, don't put in more than you can afford to lose!
@_date: 2014-07-23 05:01:44
The crypto-currency community should be unified; we have far more important battles to fight right now.
@_date: 2014-07-08 13:03:42
Absolutely agreed.
@_date: 2014-07-14 03:29:56
Sounds cool, but why?
@_date: 2014-07-25 01:25:54
It just won't be like that for Bitcoin Kay. Because the network requires protocol consensus, there's going to be a battle for control of that "consensus". We predict that bitcoin-core/master is in the hands of one or two companies completely, within 1-2 years. That's how you "regulate" this particular kind of open source project.
Not that you can't make your own coin/protocol of course!
@_date: 2014-08-13 23:37:52
Cheers, thanks!
@_date: 2014-07-08 11:07:58
Wow yeah, these are some good points guys!
Please feel free to send us a pull request eliminating the user-tracking software we installed. We'll merge it in right away.
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:02:22
We'll see what we can do.
@_date: 2014-07-08 11:48:16
We don't generate any revenue whatsoever right now. We have a few ideas, but nothing that we can pursue until the user base is at least an order of magnitude larger.
Monetizing wallets is pretty hard. We'll keep everyone posted.
@_date: 2014-06-19 23:15:55
To be clear, the backend that we interface with, bitcoinj, _is_ Java-based, but the rest is a native Objective C application.
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:03:59
None of us use Windows / know anything about it. And we haven't been able to find a decent Windows developer who does and wants to work with us. Please apply if that is you!
@_date: 2014-07-23 05:23:30
It's just not going to be like that goldcakes. Diversity is going to be the way forward whether you like it or not.
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:23:27
Hope so. Lots of work to do there.
@_date: 2014-11-15 12:19:01
Are you aware of the PoC builds, or all the work being done every day? Ethereum isn't a completed product yet, indeed, but to call it vaporware is more than a bit disingenuous.
@_date: 2014-08-16 09:16:23
PM sent!
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:04:35
Alright, we'll try to speed it up in the next version.
@_date: 2014-07-08 12:13:45
Aw man, you _saw_ Charlie Lee take off that famous diamond-encrusted silver chain necklace, latch it onto Wendell's neck and pat him on the cheek a few times while calling him a 'good boy'? They thought they were being so stealthy...
@_date: 2014-08-18 14:39:40
We've found that the user base of each platform has its own concerns. The Android users particularly seem to be more technical, and more privacy-conscious (the permissions topic has come up in Reddit Hive threads before), so we wanted to address that point head-on, first and foremost.
@_date: 2014-07-08 12:09:35
It wouldn't be! You're very much correct.
We are not against banks, we are against a confusion of language.
@_date: 2014-07-20 02:01:40
This is exactly what is going to happen, as always does. We'll likely get our SOPA moment and with it a false sense of victory, as the rest of the plan creeps back in slowly via other bills and means.
You're completely correct, the proper course is simply to ignore all of this.
@_date: 2014-08-14 15:44:45
We'll work on that.
@_date: 2014-07-08 12:07:36
Quite right, and for the record, ours was not a statement against banks. It was more a request in the realm of semantic collectivism.
@_date: 2014-08-16 15:39:47
Hi, Hive iOS is an HD wallet and it automatically generates a new address when it detects a successful received transaction. Old addresses are still monitored. You can read it over our FAQs here: 
@_date: 2014-07-08 01:32:58
As we Tweeted a few days ago, "If you don't have access to your own private keys, it's not a wallet. It's a bank." People using Coinbase should at least be educated as to the difference.
Spread the word.
@_date: 2014-07-14 00:44:26
Hey there!
Can you give that a try again? We just closed this bug which hopefully fixes your problem:
@_date: 2014-06-24 23:38:44
Yes. Very soon!
@_date: 2014-10-10 04:47:55
Exactly our thoughts over here, though to be fair this is happening in the Gentoo distribution only as far as we can see.
@_date: 2014-07-08 09:27:14
Indeed, recognized that error after it was posted. This is correct, folks.
@_date: 2014-06-25 07:50:14
We're working on removing the Java dependency from Hive for OS X. To be clear, that is a dependency for the underlying bitcoinj layer, not Hive itself (which is a native Objective C application).
In the meantime, please do try our new mobile wallet, available at hivewallet.com
@_date: 2014-07-10 12:16:41
Exactly... And more! So what is it really? Just a protocol.
@_date: 2014-07-15 02:55:47
"Bitcoin adoption" stories are likely just part of a standard PR plan at this point. Completely agreed in any case. These are largely non-events, and the real ones are to be found in the transactions and community growth, which unfortunately both seem quite stagnant.
@_date: 2014-11-15 12:12:32
Indeed. What the hell has happened to the once remarkable intelligence and mutually respectful nature of this ecosystem? A majority of the comments here are barely hovering above 2010-era YouTube in terms of their ignorance and juvenile feces-slinging. I get that we've got a bunch of folks underwater, waiting for that $10K/BTC exit strategy to pan out... But I can't imagine that such derpy levels of nastiness really make the space more attractive to outsiders who might someday want to be involved.
@_date: 2014-12-27 19:18:46
Have been wondering about that. Have a link with _good_ data?
@_date: 2014-08-14 12:49:42
Thanks for the feedback, we'll look into it.
@_date: 2014-08-14 14:58:50
We actually have an Android Hive wallet app though it doesn't have the same features with our iOS and Web wallets. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 08:27:10
Such support can be paid for.
One often wonders why growth in this subreddit is tens of users one day, thousands on another. While it's hard to correlate this with news spikes, it seemingly hasn't corresponded with transaction volume or price increases in the last 6 months anyway.
67% upvoted is pretty damn suspicious for this topic.
@_date: 2014-07-21 12:49:29
True that, probably. :)
@_date: 2014-08-09 08:50:41
Aaron, from one wallet maker to another, we just want to say: This is absolutely freaking awesome. Aesthetically, functionally, _morally_, you did everything right. Blown away.
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:19:05
We also received these.
@_date: 2014-07-24 07:31:37
Wow, where is this exactly?
@_date: 2014-07-08 09:12:11
And we should say, a bank _at best_. In reality you are probably not guaranteed anywhere near the protections of an actual, insured bank.
@_date: 2014-07-08 11:35:00
Sure, but how technical can you get though? :-)
"If you, and you alone don't have access to M-of-N of the private keys of your Bitcoin, there is risk for theft, seizure or loss unless your keys should be put into a situation in which they may be stolen or compromised by some means, possibly including extortion, wiretapping or persistent begging"
@_date: 2014-07-23 05:08:30
Hi goldcakes!
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:14:09
At the moment, no. In a few months, hopefully! :-)
@_date: 2014-07-08 14:08:20
See you at Inside Bitcoins Tel-Aviv!
@_date: 2014-08-13 23:28:55

Hi folks,
We're opening up our stats across all platforms to encourage transparency about actual Bitcoin wallet use. We welcome others to follow in this regard. Suggestions about other things we could do to improve data clarity would also be appreciated. Hopefully this is just the beginning.
Edit: Just an FYI that we have to manually import Android data for now, so that's why it is a little bit out of date.
@_date: 2014-08-14 00:43:14
We'd love to. If any wallet-makers are interested in using it, please contact us! We'll try to throw some docs up about it too.
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:23:38
Cheers, thanks for your support!
@_date: 2014-07-19 02:57:39
Thanks for pointing that out.
@_date: 2014-07-21 10:24:48
Whitelist, you mean?
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:16:44
Thanks a lot!
We'd really like to settle on one unit, and I guess bits will probably be it.
@_date: 2014-06-04 23:02:18
Source(s) for claims?
@_date: 2014-06-25 08:23:35
We're looking at our options. In truth we would love to maintain multiple native apps, taking advantage of all new native features as soon as they are released. In reality, we have a limited team and limited budget and want to make the maximum possible impact.
We're thinking on it though, we don't want to drop them either.
@_date: 2014-07-08 11:55:48
It's not exactly what was meant, but the point is indeed nearly the same.
@_date: 2014-07-08 11:36:11
Cheers akkatracker, looking forward to it!
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:12:44
Maybe? We've got some issues to sort first:
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:15:03
Hi please send us the details of it on our support mail and we'll try to resolve it. Thanks for reporting!
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:02:03
That's exactly right.
@_date: 2014-06-19 23:16:54
Literally the source? :-)
@_date: 2014-07-08 12:04:00
It's definitely an interesting idea. Is anyone moving in any kind of insured direction besides Xapo?
@_date: 2014-07-09 07:58:56
Apologies and cheers for the report. In fact it probably only works in WebKit browsers right now (it was specifically targeting iOS mobile). More browser support will be coming soon!
@_date: 2014-07-23 05:45:34
You know that isn't what we meant. :-) And anyway, whether or not currency is a natural monopoly is an experiment that will have to play itself out. Right now, we don't believe it.
@_date: 2014-08-14 00:13:09
That's mean. But FYI, it's still going on, only the name and organizers have changed:
@_date: 2014-07-08 01:58:55
Agreed. We are in the post-Snowden age now. There is no excuse.
@_date: 2014-07-10 01:11:47
That doesn't sound like a replacement to the Foundation then, at least in terms of its original charter.
@_date: 2014-07-21 11:22:19
Bitcoin is not anonymous unless you _really_ know what you're doing.
@_date: 2014-07-23 05:30:43
All the more reason for there to be alternatives then.
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:44:42
Yep. that's our thinking too.
@_date: 2014-07-18 06:27:25
This is a very wise comment.
@_date: 2014-07-08 13:06:25
Agreed and good points.
EDIT: Agreed and _noted for more refined future rants on this topic_.
@_date: 2014-07-08 11:29:45
Great minds? 
@_date: 2014-07-09 07:26:11
Congrats gentlemen!
@_date: 2014-08-14 00:22:29
Try the direct link above for now. It may not have propagated.
@_date: 2014-08-13 23:50:04
Sorry about that, but yes it is.
@_date: 2014-07-25 04:21:49
Some of those are really terrible things. But let's see some proof that AML laws have done anything to reduce their presence in society.
@_date: 2014-07-21 10:24:22
Hear, hear.
@_date: 2014-07-09 08:22:07
How does Lighthouse replace the Foundation exactly? We weren't exactly clear on why Mike won that bounty... Though all respects to him for Lighthouse itself, which looks amazing.
@_date: 2014-07-23 05:54:51
I'd like to understand you a bit better goldcakes. You're obviously quite serious and passionate about all of this, but I guess I don't get where the vitriol comes from. Surely alternatives are no threat to this, if Gresham's Law is correct?
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:05:16
Glad you got it working. Not sure why it hasn't propagated out yet.
@_date: 2014-07-07 07:20:11
That's the key.
@_date: 2014-08-13 23:36:15
Will update shortly.
@_date: 2014-07-08 13:03:33
You should definitely have access to your private keys if you are using Electrum.
@_date: 2014-06-28 09:31:02
OMG Ashton Kutcher!
@_date: 2014-07-25 05:17:56
As far as we know, Mike is only an advisor to Circle.
Anyway, best to start here if you want to get it right:
@_date: 2014-07-19 13:28:28
Love that. What is the universal glyph for ignore? :)
@_date: 2014-07-09 07:59:59
BIP39 mnemonics are really not so hard.
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:04:57
Right now, only if it is a BIP32 wallet in the form of a BIP39 passphrase. Later, of course more options will be available.
@_date: 2014-07-21 02:27:37
Yes, including _all_ nodes, specifically citing that you cannot know where a user coming through a Tor node is actually located.
In terms of assumed probabilities, unless the majority of Tor users are based in New York, it's far more likely that any user coming through a NY-based Tor exit node is _not_ from New York.
@_date: 2015-05-23 15:17:00
Hi there, can you email me personally with your system configuration (browser type, OS, and ideally a screenshot of the error)? w 
@_date: 2014-07-21 02:40:00
If Tor exit nodes are not blocked, they do not need to run a node at all.
@_date: 2014-06-19 23:12:13
Oh Jason, you know we would never tease you without full intention of delivering the goods in short order. :-)
@_date: 2014-06-25 07:36:48
Indeed. That's the main reason by the way, that we will be creating Phonegap-wrapped versions of Hive "Web", to be released shortly. That will have the ability to scan QR codes. The code is already done.
@_date: 2014-10-04 20:03:37
Yeah that's something we want to add, but pulling data out of Apple hasn't been easy. Will look into those, thanks!
@_date: 2014-06-24 23:39:07
Why not be ambitious? :)
@_date: 2014-07-21 07:44:20
Who specifically?
EDIT: It's time to start taking statement accounting seriously and fall no further for hearsay and propaganda.
@_date: 2015-05-23 15:18:45
Just to be clear, hive-js and its variants (Hive for iOS and the latest Android version) indeed rely on servers. Hive for OS X however is a full SPV wallet, as is the older Android version made by Jan.
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:13:52
This is an interesting idea! Would you mind terribly mocking up how you see it best implemented and posting it here?
@_date: 2015-05-23 15:17:32
Please let me know as well in that email how you tried to contact support, as we haven't received anything with details about this issue in particular.
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:07:23
The reason why that's basically impossible is that someone, or some group of people, have to control the master branch. Those people will have their own ideas and biases and favor them above others. A protocol must have _one_ direction, which at least in part explains why we now have over 500.
@_date: 2014-07-18 07:05:25
Wisdom right here.
@_date: 2014-07-08 13:51:22
More than likely it is very safe. That said, whether it is or is not is out of your control without you (and only you) having full control over the private key(s).
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:19:15
Not sure if your point is entirely understood, but doesn't Bitcoin also suffer from "version control"? If the freedom to innovate is limited within Bitcoin — as it *must be* if some order is to be maintained — then non-Bitcoin protocols/blockchains will naturally emerge. It's really as simple as that.
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:42:39
Proof? Not saying you're wrong, but if your claim is made relative to the number of people who are holding each one, please compare the data for Bitcoin and *all other coins*.
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:48:04
Sounds interesting. Link to research?
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:31:17
Whether Bitcoin or Litecoin, the fact is that a day-to-day utility for "normals" has not been found. Intriguingly, this is what some of the application-specific tokens are trying to address.
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:34:25
We support Bitcoin and Litecoin. So you think they're both scams?
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:05:24
That seems inconclusive to say the very least.
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:49:31
Well said, and unfortunately very true.
@_date: 2015-01-05 06:45:31
Surely you're right about Bitcoin having the largest number of holders. But we are speaking of numbers relative to the total number of holders of a given token, are we not?
As for the rest...
widely accepted ideas ≠ facts
industry propaganda ≠ facts
So please, bring the data. It won't be easy to gather, which is presumably why optimistic rumor is usually preferred. That said, it would literally be wonderful to find out that this is all true.
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:41:44
Of course for *some* of those coins you're probably quite right. But why generalize if you don't actually have any real data? Same about the supposed number of holders. This industry basically lives and dies by rumor, but don't you agree that that's actually quite damaging?
@_date: 2015-01-05 01:26:46
This community has ignored a very wise reframing of the nature of this technology's atomic unit, as proposed by Stan Larimer:
*"Bitcoins can be viewed as a small “share” of the total market cap of the Bitcoin “corporation”.   The “mining” services that validate transactions and secure the network are paid for in new bitcoins that slowly dilute the “stock” as the corporation’s market cap ebbs and flows."*
( source:  )
While Bitcoin continues to be referred to simply as *money*, this kind of confusion will continue to rear its head. But properly reframed, it's obvious that this isn't a winner-take-all game any more than stocks are. If Bitcoin is so great, such a honey badger, etc, then it *will* survive the ongoing, never ending, blockchain experiments as a defining example of how a distributed autonomous corporation should work.
Fingers crossed for that one!
@_date: 2015-01-05 01:44:51
Exactly. It's rationally understandable why large and/or underwater stakeholders would wish this away, but market forces will dictate what they will. There are a lot of incentives to create new coins, not the least of which is a self-granted permission to innovate technically, socially, or otherwise.
Bitcoin is less like a currency than a stock. And until holders of that stock gain a monopoly over human creativity, new blockchains and meta-layers will continue to manifest, ad infinitum.
That said, long live Bitcoin *and* independently pursued blockchain innovation!

Non-Bitcoin tokens are not your enemy. Your enemy is Bitcoin's present lack of *actual* day-to-day utility for normal people.

Hi there. Can you email us (copying this whole story) so we can have more rapid back-and-forth about this? w
It sounds like expected behavior, but if your Litecoin wallet is showing a balance and the Bitcoin wallet does not (where it definitely did have one), then something is possibly amiss.
@_date: 2015-09-20 03:47:32
If that's working for them I'd definitely like to see some data. Obviously the problem that would stop such a scheme dead in its tracks is the cold reality that not many people are using Bitcoin day-to-day. I (Wendell) live in a cash-oriented country, but it's still pretty telling to admit that I only open my wallet once or twice twice per week.
@_date: 2015-09-22 04:01:50
Is this hardware open? Do we have docs for the chips?

I am not and never was the developer of the iOS app. Developers need to be paid. Now that said, if you want to make the updates and send us a pull request, you can do so via this:
We'll also need verified binaries and ultimately Apple's approval, as well.
@_date: 2015-09-20 05:59:34
We were removed, for the iOS version. I'm not sure if they'll want to remove hive-js or not, which does still work even if it is not supported. In any case I'm sure this will be spotted and I leave it  to them to judge.

Hive has never made a single satoshi in revenue.
That may sound bad, but I think many of us building end-user Bitcoin software back in late 2012/2013 had a rather different perspective on how this was all going to play out. I personally assumed Bitcoin would have millions of daily users by early 2014, which would greatly widen our palette of revenue-generating options. For example, if you check the very earliest versions of Hive, we had a whole notion of an app platform within a wallet. A play like that would begin to be viable when Bitcoin started to touch those numbers.
In any case, this general conception led to what were in hindsight, naive decisions. For example, I assumed that using BTC as the investment "currency" would cause our effective holdings to increase value by orders of magnitude, giving Hive an extremely long, if not practically infinite runway for development. I wanted to fully embrace the Bitcoin economy, and didn't want to ethically compromise in the sense of taking investment the old fashioned way -- something which was certainly on offer. You surely know the story from here. When BTC's value started to collapse, it was obvious that we didn't raise enough money to begin with, at a time when we should have raised much, much more.
Bad call (though I still agree with the ethics), but that's how it goes sometimes.
@_date: 2015-09-27 04:36:27
This, so much. The narrative about helping developing countries really had a stink about it, and you've articulated it perfectly.
@_date: 2015-09-20 01:02:41
Here is a shareable Tweet about it. Because we cannot reach all of our users past and present by email or any other centralized means, I would appreciate people spreading this around in the community:
@_date: 2015-09-21 01:21:18
Well, we absolutely don't have a centralized channel that is guaranteed to reach everyone. Not even the wallet itself, given what we've seen of the traffic patterns. In any case, you're responding to a post on Reddit about this topic, right now, and the first Tweet on our Twitter links to it.
About emails, I've tried to answer every single one I've received, but my apologies if I missed one or another. Re-send the email to w if you're still having issues.

Same investors. A possibility.
@_date: 2015-09-21 01:36:58
I see what you're implying, but the larger issue is shown in Blockchain having 100K-500K downloads. If that's the leading wallet with some of the best SEO, it shows where things stand generally in this space right now.
@_date: 2015-09-23 11:28:28
what you wrote is the most important post.
Indeed, it's obvious that they won't be able to **help** being the largest pool if they are successful. I think I know the answer, but I put this question to Balaji anyway:
What is also a concern is what is *not* open source:
Presumably, 100% of the hardware, per ...and what else?
It's absolutely brilliant, the whole idea and scheme. They're not going to fold or move onto something else. This is one of the biggest business opportunities I've ever seen. But I've said it before, and I'll say it again: it *is* without question a [Master Switch]( play not just for Bitcoin, but for the **whole Internet**. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 07:27:54
That would make sense, but as for the iOS app, as I've said elsewhere, we have no one left on our team with an OS X machine (or the time, frankly) who is willing to do it. That said, the site will be updated at some point, to remove the mobile download links, and the app will be removed from the iTunes Store.
@_date: 2015-09-20 05:58:32
I appreciate this. Previous posts about these issues have attempted to frame Hive as irresponsible. It may seem so, but I have personally tried to answer every query or issue that I was made aware of, long after we'd exhausted our operating capital (while holding down other work, and certainly without any compensation). The same can be said of other members of the team who did their best to support it.
@_date: 2015-09-22 04:13:41
Nope, you're on the mark. This is it.

Hi there, I'm looking for another BIP32 wallet for Litecoin. If we don't find a suitable one, I'll see if I can work with the Litecoin community to find the best solution for sweeping your keys into a reasonably easy-to-use wallet.
@_date: 2015-09-20 00:35:09
I'm pretty sure that you're just commenting on open source wallet businesses generally speaking, but for the record: Hive is and has always been open.
To the other comment, what you say is indeed true, and it's a real shame considering the strong momentum ( see  ) and the high quality of the overall application design.
We actually have a pretty awesome new wallet product planned and designed, something which could make money without a grotesque compromise of ethics and integrity, and we're trying to gather up the funds for it presently. This would also allow us to finally resume development of the existing wallets. We'll post here if that works out, fingers crossed.
@_date: 2015-09-20 00:31:14
It wasn't the "web guy" you spoke to, it was me, Wendell, the founder/creator.
I apologize for the issues people have been having with Hive. You're right, I should have more clearly announced the glacial (not _entirely_ frozen, see below) development, but we can't actually reach all of our users, and we assume that everyone knows our GitHub URL ([github.com/hivewallet]( which shows pretty transparently what is or is not going on.
**Hive Web and Hive iOS are BIP32/BIP39 compatible, so you should be able to directly use your passphrase in any other wallet supporting that standard. This includes the excellent Bread Wallet, and I believe Mycelium as well.**
It would be nice if some new maintainers for one or more of the platforms appeared, because with the patches that Wei created recently ( live @  ), it actually does work fine. However, these changes have not been rolled into the iOS version, and no one over here who might touch it uses OS X for development anymore.
We'll keep our servers on, but the wallets are basically unsupported. Again, because we respect your privacy and collect no data other than raw wallet numbers, we can't simply reach out to all of our users by email or some other means. Please help to spread the word by retweeting this:
@_date: 2015-09-22 04:21:44
This is my major concern. If this is about building the backbone of the next major change in "the way we use the Internet", I'd hate to see it built on a proprietary stack of hardware+software doing god-knows-what, or able to self-update and _start doing_ god-knows-what.
@_date: 2015-09-20 12:09:57
It's probably more a question for the business philosophers.
My opinion is that every situation is unique. It's probably easy to get so distracted by revenue-building that you let your product suffer, and yet (as in our case) your product will also suffer if you miscalculate the future to such a degree that you run out of money. Also of course depends on basic things such as, what's your burn rate and how much runway you have with the capital you raised...
@_date: 2015-09-20 03:02:56
Well now, it's hardly down the shitter. Just moving fairly glacially at the moment. If we find some more funds, all that will change. Meanwhile, please feel free to send pull requests, as the inside joke goes. :-)
@_date: 2015-09-20 01:36:37
Yeah, something changed in iOS 8.4.1 that caused it to stop working. Ironically it seems to have been partially restored with iOS 9. Really sorry about that, but as I said elsewhere, we need a new maintainer for the iOS version.
@_date: 2015-09-20 05:48:53
Yeah indeed, this is one of the reasons people should not be _too_ fussed about this. BIP32+BIP39 literally means the ability to move between compatible wallets with ease.
@_date: 2015-09-20 11:28:17
OK but how many wallets do you think we could really sell at $0.99? Personally I don't think it would move the needle even remotely when skilled programmers can rarely be found for less than $60K/year. Let's face it: There are _not_ tens of millions of active Bitcoin users; if there were perhaps one could tell a credible "capture x % of y market at 99c each" story.
@_date: 2015-09-20 06:53:09
One of the disheartening things I learned about operating a wallet at any scale, is that users treat you with the same suspicious intolerance that they would a so-called financial institution, even if you've made it explicitly clear that they are in charge of their own "bank", and even if they _know_ that you are just a couple of guys (or a couple of guys and a couple of girls, in our case) trying to make a good product.
In some ways it is deeply unfortunate that Bitcoin rose in value so fast, because we never really got to build a relationship with our users outside of that frame, which is basically toxic. Presumably this is why the majority of users are destined to flock to closed-source "bitcoin banks" with their dubious terms of service and massive war chests. Those institutions have a different kind of agenda altogether, and their lack of transparency is taken almost as point of pride. But they _can_ apparently handle harsh and perpetually dissatisfied users just fine. On the other hand, Coinkite seems to have found something uniquely in the middle, and I wish them luck in proving that out.
@_date: 2015-09-20 00:38:19
Considering our tiny user base (see *[stats.hivewallet.com]( and the reality that we've been open for almost three years and have _only just_ had one single, external contribution and one fork, I'm not really sure that that would have worked out for us. :)
@_date: 2015-09-20 09:04:34
Only in the Web version, which is now fixed. We don't have anyone with an appropriate OS X setup who can make an iOS build for us anymore, unfortunately.
@_date: 2015-09-20 05:46:23
We're out of operating capital and have been for quite a while, so no one has really been working on Hive for over a year. By that measure, Hive certainly failed as a company, though there _is_ a glimmer of hope... Either way, its open source nature means that it can live on without us. Fork and continue, as God intended.
Future plans don't involve us pivoting from the wallet space. We've already completely designed a new wallet and a new architecture for some of the tricker things we weren't able to do (or do well) before. It all simply awaits funds for implementation...
@_date: 2015-09-21 01:34:17
If there are interested developers, we are and always have been willing to take pull requests and updates.
@_date: 2015-09-20 05:53:45
We don't actually have a way to contact most of our users, or we would have done that. Don't remember being forced to submit your email/phone/etc when you created your wallet? That's because we didn't ask, and we still don't want to know.
There are consequences of a pro-privacy position, and I suppose this is one of them. In any case, the reality is that everyone's Bitcoin is safe. Just put your passphrase into another wallet and carry on. It was designed to work that way.
@_date: 2015-03-03 03:51:24
Hi there, Wei just deployed a new testing release to  can you please check that with your passphrase?

It's odd that you should pick out a quote from this podcast to try to make such a point, when the interview itself makes my over-the-top enthusiasm about this technology, plus my actual views on where it is headed, abundantly clear.
For the record: I still hold the belief that "money" is a modern-day convenience, but an anachronism in the face of what is now actually possible. I still believe that there will be a blockchain-secured token for every noun – including every person on the planet – representing a way of "investing in" and/or accurately seeing the value of (and all-importantly, the _connected value to_) _everything_. To the point I made in the interview, this is a derivation of Bucky Fuller's concept of the Dymaxion or "World Game" computer.
If you really think I made this up, just because I didn't become a 10x-100x millionaire from my bitcoin holdings, then I politely suggest that you consume your favorite entheogen, take a walk in the forest, and read Philip K Dick's "Ubik" on the comedown. We do not all share the same perspective of the _present_ in this space, let alone the future.
@_date: 2015-02-20 01:51:40
This is Kuba's thread, and I want to avoid derailing it any more than you have already effectively done here, but I will say two things:
1) Kuba does indeed have carte blanche over the Mac version of Hive, and you can take him at his word with regard to his perspective.
2) FWIW, I love Bitcoin and want to see Bitcoin thrive, but as it turns out, I am a decentralization, free software, and privacy enthusiast, far more than a subscriber to one or more particular monetary/economic theories. The statement quoted was in regards to what I saw, and continue to see, as the unhealthy and unreasonable reaction to _new developments_ in the blockchain/cryptocurrency ecosystem... or what Vitalik dubs "Bitcoin Maximalism". I think it's wishful and illogical thinking, and indeed, I don't believe in it at all.
That said, my statement was unfortunately worded. I had recently engaged in a barrage of similar discussions at that time, and felt pretty despairing of what _seemed_ to be the sudden end to one of the greatest periods of inquiry, fellowship and powerfully experimental software development that I had ever seen in my life. It should be obvious from my support of Kuba's project however, that I can disagree with someone's opinion and not attempt to suppress or stymie it.
If anyone wants to have a discussion about any of this other, effectively off topic stuff, feel free to contact me at w
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:32:51
My issue is with the Bitcoin Maximalist implication that there should _not_ be non-Bitcoin tokens. I don't think it's right that we should plug our ears to new ideas and innovations while insulting and demeaning both the people and the work that disagree, just because it _might_ lower the value of our holdings (which I disagree with anyway, e.g. "a rising tide lifts all boats").
Of course scarcity plus demand is what makes these tokens valuable, but _if_ the conceptual framework of the blockchain is orders of magnitude more successful (i.e. _actually_ successful), then there will be room for hundreds of thousands of these things, if not millions.
tl;dr Scarcity is fine. I am opposed to monocultures, narrow thinking, and mob rule.
@_date: 2015-02-20 13:36:07
You seem to be assuming that present-day means of value abstraction – what we currently call money or currency – will persist rather than wildly mutating. If you like, see here for a condensation of my view to the contrary:
I really do believe that we are soon going to come into an age in which tokenized reputation is far more valuable than money. It is likewise my belief that in such an environment, generalized "currencies" will no longer be needed.
