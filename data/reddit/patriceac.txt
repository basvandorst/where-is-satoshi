Great question, something I've been asking myself for a while now without finding a good answer yet.

The route type shown on your screenshot is "local". You're trying to connect to a node on your local network, a.k.a. your own computer. No wonder it can't connect to the LN. ��

If you have the address you can check with an online blockchain explorer, but most likely your transaction is the only one this address did and will ever receive. Agree that it'd be safer to use the QR code of your wallet next time and still double check before posting the transaction. And the QR code of the public address is safe, so even if you lose it is no big deal as long as you still have the private key. Nobody can access your money with the public key only.

Poor people have little savings if any at all. When they do they tend to keep money in a savings account. Such account typically yields 1% interest. With a 2% yearly inflation target their savings lose purchase power over time. For the vast majority though, inflation will simply rise faster than their paychecks. Same outcome.
Rich people tend to invest in stocks and other items which typically beat inflation. Therefore their portfolio beats inflation hand down.
Therefore, over time the rich gets richer and the poor poorer.

That's Keynesian economic theory 101, a.k.a. the deflationary spiral boogeyman. Its main effect is to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.
How about a world where people just spend what they need to, and their savings actually gain value over time? People won't stop all spending. They will still buy food, leisure, services. They just won't overspend, and that's OK. Of course, that's not good for banks, but banks aren't good for the people either so that's just fair game.

No, you just have to backup your wallet keys once. The wallet's balance is actually recorded on the public blockchain. Your private key is just how you unlock your wallet to be able to spend from your balance.

Head to this page: 
There's an offline version, which you can download and run offline. This week let your enter your seed phrase and generate the private keys for you.
The way and safe way to check you got it right is to merely compare the public address generated by the app to the one you're using. If they match then you can sweep the corresponding private key using a trusted wallet.
Good luck!

In 5 years timeframe the market is likely going up if the last 10 years are any indication. Putting 1K into Bitcoin is the (relatively) easy part though. The real challenge will be to (1) store it safely and (2) hodl it for 5 years without panic selling during the inevitable corrections.
@_date: 2019-07-05 16:23:45
Not directly as far as I know. Historically the money supply always went up, *seemingly* resulting in the cycle of bubbles and bursts that we all familiar with. I think the rise of Bitcoin would be a first of its kind since the Roman empire started to expand the money supply by diluting silver and gold in their coins.
So in some respect, Satoshi kicked off an historical experiment. For centuries, Keynesianism has been ruling the economy, making the rich richer and the poor poorer. It'll be interesting to see the effects of hard money and fixed supply on the economy in the decades ahead.

Bitcoin's scale makes it the most secure crypto, and the shelling effect makes it a great store of value *in the long run*. In some respect, you can call this "the hype", but it's more than that. An easy way to understand it is as follows: you're given one million USD, but you have to store it for 10 years before being able to access it. You're only allowed to store all of it in a single cryptocurrency. Choose.

@_date: 2019-07-11 18:32:34
People don't use Ethereum as a store of value. Besides, your argument only considers the market capitalization. If you factor in the transaction volume Bitcoin is much ahead.
Again, here an analogy: I could create my own token, like a shitload of it, and sell some amount to establish a baseline price. Now my token suddenly has a huge market cap. Doesn't mean it's widely adopted though. So I may also pay 3rd parties with my token to adopt it and build apparent legitimacy. And so on.
Could you imagine if a company like Ripple did just that with XRP? It would... Oh... Wait...
@_date: 2019-07-12 04:57:01

Want so see this theory in practice? Just look what's going on in Venezuela.

Nope. Bitcoin is deflationary by design and extremely secure. What's not secure on the other hand is hot wallets and exchanges, so if you decide to use Bitcoin as a long term store of value make sure to use a cold wallet.

A Bitcoin full node is not a BitTorrent tracker. The main point of a full node is not about data sharing and upload/download ratio. Validating transactions is how nodes contribute to the ecosystem, and in that regard every node matters regardless of how long they stay online.
@_date: 2019-03-28 00:35:05
The exchange is most likely using a shared address for all transactions. I don't think you'd be able to track the transaction after the exchange.

Manipulation is likely happening in the current market as can be seen on the charts through those brutal ups and downs. On the other hand, Bitcoin not being regulated, those manipulations are technically not illegal (although morally reprehensible). In the long run this manipulation will stop or significantly reduce as the liquidity and market cap of Bitcoin increases. It's just a matter of time.
While the price is currently down, the fundamentals are stronger than ever and the price will eventually reflect it once more money is flowing through the ecosystem via the likes of Bakkt and Fidelity.
@_date: 2019-03-17 01:47:26
You'll be just fine
@_date: 2019-03-21 16:29:54
Yes, and there are also places where you can pay for things and services with Bitcoin, from food to real estate properties. That certainly looks like tangible value to me.
@_date: 2019-03-07 15:57:40
Thanks everyone for the great comments! After going through your thoughts, it looks like the primary reason for casual consumers to pay their coffee or groceries using Bitcoin would be if some of the savings the seller makes on lower fees would be passed down to the consumer. E.g. if the fees on Visa or MasterCard are 2%+$0.10 but paying with Bitcoin is 1% fee, then apply a 0.5% rebate to any purchase paid for using Bitcoin. On a $5 coffee this would save the merchant 50% on fees (7.5 cents instead of 15 cents per transaction).
@_date: 2019-03-21 16:48:15
Thanks for clarifying your point of view, I understand where you're coming from.
@_date: 2019-03-06 05:02:24
That makes sense. My understanding is that this would eventually be prevented by:
 - proper regulations. Market manipulation is illegal for related assets.
 - liquidity. The more volume and market cap, the harder it becomes to manipulate the price.
I guess only time will tell...

IMO the value of Bitcoin derives from its deflationary policy. With fiat, the poor is doomed to stay poor because inflation will kill their savings. This doesn't happen with Bitcoin. I may not have much money today, but every Satoshi set aside is hard money which won't lose value. This is what should drive adoption, as opposed to wealth distribution.
@_date: 2019-03-20 17:22:39
Was it because of heavy volume of transactions competing to be validated, hence higher fees to get higher priority.
@_date: 2019-03-28 14:09:43
No worries, I don't have any money on this hard drive. And in case it would fail, I believe there are currently 10,000 full nodes or so out there, so the Bitcoin network should be fine. ��

Confirm this looks like a dusting attack. You're safe as long as you don't move the funds. If you move it to some compromised location it may be used to identify you. It's an attack targeting your privacy, not a direct attempt to steal your bitcoins. The way around it is to send your funds to a trials exchange and send it back from the exchange to a *new* address.

The thing is there's no need for definitive proof. This is not the IRS coming after you. �� It's more of a large scale attack like phishing. They don't care if a specific use takes the bait. They just target many users, hoping that some of them will fall for it.
Here's how I imagine it works: I have two wallets, and I sometimes transfer Bitcoin from one to the other. Wallet A receives some dust, which I transfer to wallet B. I later spend this dust from wallet B on a website to buy something and get it sent to my personal address. Somehow, attacker has access to the customer database. They can now connect the dust I received to my personal info and come after me, either via the Internet with phishing attempts, or in person if circumstances permit (or if my wallet is large enough I assume).

My understanding is that this happens because both sellers and buyers are at equilibrium. One one call is exhausted, the price will suddenly move in fake of the other side. E.g. there are buyers and sellers. As people sell, others are here to buy, thus consolidating the price. But once we run out of sellers, buyers will cause the price to rise. Conversely, running out of buyers will cause the price to drop.
@_date: 2019-08-29 19:30:09

I understand what you're saying and I also think you're overlooking the effects of increasing adoption. It goes something like this: let's assume for the sake of the argument that with the current adoption (let's assume about 1% of the WW population - just guessing here) all bitcoins have been mined, and no new ones are being added to the supply anymore. So $20B worth of USD are being traded daily. Let's round this to 2,000,000 BTC changing hands daily at an average price of $10,000. If I understand correctly, that's essentially your argument.
Now let me ask this: with this hypothetically stable supply of BTC, what will happen to the price of this fixed amount of BTC when 1% of BTC users becomes 2%? 10%? 50%? etc. There are no new BTC created, but more and more people want some. Fixed supply and increasing demand will inevitably cause the price to rise.
Again- all values provided above are rough estimates and assumptions and may be wildly inaccurate. The point is about the rationale, not the numbers.
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:57:24
Would you be able to handle a drop to 3,000 without panicking if you go all in now?
A better move night be to define a smaller amount you want to put in Bitcoin every week/month and stick to it irrespective of price variations. In the long run that would get you a better risk/reward balance. And that'll get you acquainted to FUD and FOMO and make you realize how difficult controlling your own emotions can be.

Halving/halvening is this event taking place every 4 years when the Bitcoin reward gets divided by 2, thus drastically reducing the supply and bumping the price due to the law of demand and offering.

Add to this the long bear market, the recent golden cross, Fidelity Digital Assets, Bakkt, the upcoming halving, and it seems likely that Bitcoin (BTC) is poised to hit new ATH and we might never see the current price level ever again.

I think the net produced amount matters more than the traded volume. 1,800 BTC are currently absorbed daily. After the halving only half of this amount will be minted daily, this increasing the buying pressure and ultimately the price if the demand stays constant.

I see the 3 rows of 6 dots, and I also can count 18 dots per group, and 54 total for the logo. I see where you're coming from, and I personally don't read too much into this. Neither am I worried about IOTA and other altcoins (Bitcoin maximalist here).
To your initial question, I personally think Bitcoin can save us all from inflation and poor management from Central Banks and governments, and I don't think this is related to the number of the beast. The reason why I don't see a strong link is because the same argument can be reverted. For example, according to Mark 10:25 (NKJV), "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." Most of those who are into Bitcoin are hoping to get rich one day, which could be interpreted as Bitcoin preventing one from getting into heaven, whereas failing altcoins - which keep people poor - are a good thing.
This interpretation seems to be the opposite of the previous one, which maybe suggests that these interpretations are just coincidental?
@_date: 2019-12-04 03:11:05
I'm confused. Are you now positing that Bitcoin (the savior) is actually the false prophet?
@_date: 2019-12-03 01:30:04
I respectfully disagree with your reasoning here. According to the scriptures you're referencing, the mark of the beast should be imposed on sometimes right hand or forehead. Something like a tattoo I guess. Or maybe an NFC chip of some sort, which might well be located in the right hand, say under the skin. But the forehead seems far fetched. Like, people scanning their forehead to pay? Doesn't match the description of the scriptures.
Therefore, I'd rather see a coincidence here more than anything else?

I think in your worldview the mark of the beast has a negative connotation. Therefore, it would seem that Bitcoin would be the solution. But since Bitcoin is also openly slated against banks, that would make banks the mark of the beast?

If you're really considering using Bitcoin you may want to start by creating an account on Coinbase PRO and buy/sell/transfer small amounts between crypto and your bank account to get acquainted with the process. Then once you're comfortable with it you'll know how to proceed to get your sale's money back to your bank account. With Bitcoin the amount is not the primary concern as long as you can get Coinbase to raise your limits and can justify where the money is coming from.

I actually mined Bitcoin back then. Then I shrugged it off as a stupid concept (it is not real money) and uninstalled the software. Not a single day goes by that I don't think about it.

I would invest the amount I can afford to lose in BTC and put most of the remainder in another asset class, while keeping an emergency fund in fiat so I don't have to sell my assets at the first hiccup. Inflation will slowly grind your savings if you keep everything in fiat.

Long story short, keeping your bitcoins on an exchange is like storing your gold at the bank. If the bank gets robbed, your gold is gone. If the exchange gets hacked, your Bitcoin is gone.
A wallet will give you the same QR codes as the exchange for sending and receiving, except that you're the one in charge of the custody. The upside is that you control your money. The downside is that if you lose your wallet keys or get them stolen, you lose your bitcoins.
If I could get paid in Bitcoin I would have the money sent to my own private wallet and only have a small amount on the exchange for day to day needs.
@_date: 2019-05-25 05:22:44
Nothing unfortunately. But the store could have their own LN wallet and then p2p payments would have very little fees.

I'd just go buy it now and hodl for the foreseeable future no matter which direction the price takes on the short term. The halving is less than a year away, trying to time the market now probably isn't the best idea ever. I convinced my wife to buy some Bitcoin with the agreement she would not sell before September 2020 no matter what happens to the price between now and then, and I'm very confident this is a winning bet.

Ooh. Right. $1 million per Bitcoin was the figure I had in mind. Didn't realize 1 sat per USD actually meant $100,000,000 per coin.

Thanks everyone! Lots of different perspectives out there! It will be a few more days before the money becomes available, we'll see how the market evolves, but I think I'm leaning towards weekly DCA over the next 4 months or so. By then the situation should be more clear with Bakkt, Fidelity, and the NASDAQ.
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:05:56
That person would very unlikely be the real Satoshi. According to Satoshi's own original whitepaper, the valid chain is defined as the one with most consensus, which in the present case is arguably the Bitcoin chain. Therefore, I'd argue anyone claiming Bitcoin Cash is the "real" Bitcoin would by definition be contradicting Satoshi. Looking at you guys, Roger Ver and Craig Wright.
@_date: 2019-05-07 01:32:45
Yeah, the scale might be off a little bit.
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:17:37
Did my own math paper napkin math and came to the conclusion that it would take something like 7 transactions every second adding $50,000 each to the market cap until the end of 2020. Assuming I did it right, that seems to be a lot, but it's just my opinion.
Anyone else wants to take a crack at it and see where that lands?
@_date: 2019-05-08 03:14:54

No longer true with Lightning Network though.
@_date: 2019-05-26 04:37:53
1. Wrong. The Lightning Network is the network formed by all open channels. Bear in mind you don't need to necessarily have a channel open with whomever you want to pay, just like you don't need a direct road to wherever you wanna go.
2. Whenever one of the parties closes the channel, the final balances are committed to the blockchain.
3. When using an open source wallet you can be reasonably trustful. Beside, LN is usually used for relatively small transactions, like a few tens of dollars. Concerning your debit card, when you pay at restaurant how do you know the waiter/waitress who leaves with your debit card won't write down the number before bringing it back to you?
4. Bigger blocks would result in more centralization and can only scale to a point. Besides, one would still have to wait for the block to be confirmed. Unless like Roger Ver toute an advocate of zero confirmation transactions. LN uses a more sophisticated paradigm which allows it to scale to virtually unlimited transactions per second without sacrificing decentralization or security.
@_date: 2019-05-26 18:57:06
Most likely yes, assuming both original and current wallet follow the BIP39 specification.
@_date: 2019-05-18 20:38:38
Network effect
@_date: 2019-05-10 23:30:50
You can use Breez and send the money through the Lighting Network. Loading the LN wallet may take a few minutes to hours depending on the fees your ready to pay, but then any transaction is virtually instant and extremely cheap (like a couple sats).
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:57:36
Well, it all comes down to how often you plan to make Bitcoin payments. If it's a regular need, this week definitely help!
@_date: 2018-12-13 18:12:55
That's my understanding. As to whether withdrawal will be allowed and how, your guess is as good as mine. ��
@_date: 2019-05-10 23:34:19
All LN wallets are not born equal. ��
In order of ease of use I would say it good:
1) Breez
2) Blue Wallet
3) Eclair
4) Other LN-enabled wallets (above are the 3 I tried and liked)
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:08:20
Finally an advice that makes sense.

Would love to, but your actually right. ��
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:22:47
Of course, as we all know terrorists and drug dealers only use cash and would never have bank accounts, drive cars, or use cellphones. Right? Otherwise it would mean these are supporting terrorists and nobody cares.

@_date: 2019-05-25 06:34:15
With the private key anyone can import your address in a wallet and use it to send your bitcoins to another address. All they need is the private key itself.
@_date: 2019-05-19 05:10:29
You can see this by trying to send your bitcoins to a wallet. It'll tell you how much is available by when.
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:26:58
My reading of that statement is that Bakkt will store the purchased bitcoins in their own cold wallets, similar to a bank storing your money on your behalf. Retail investors say "not your private key, not your bitcoin", but institutions and the general public (thinking about you Dad!) don't know how to store their own BTC and don't want to deal with this burden.
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:00:25
I am willing to sell up to 1% of my stack when that is worth enough to pay off my loan - should that day ever come.
@_date: 2019-05-26 05:54:17
1. Each LN node can have multiple channels open and enable transactions to be sent across channels. Again, think of channels as streets, nodes as crossroads, and transactions as cars. By making turns at crossroads your car can go from start to destination by driving through multiple streets and multiple crossroads 
2. Transactions are broadcasted to the main chain and propagated through full Bitcoin nodes. Once a block is solved, this is broadcasted to other nodes again to validate the transaction. The longest chain wins. And yeah, is all open source software and based on maths without the need to trust anyone. For more details please refer to the original Bitcoin whitepaper.
3. If I can get your credit card number, expiration date, and 3 digits code on the back I can spend your money online without needing your PIN code.
4. Big blocks require more powerful hardware, which means less people can afford it, hence more centralization. Bigger blocks still have a limit. It's just higher. But you will eventually fail to scale up. LN in the other hand can have virtually unlimited number of channels, all processing transactions simultaneously without impacting other nodes. The problem with zero confirmation is trust, or the lack thereof. Would you let me leave with your car if I showed you I have cash and promised to send it to you 10 minutes later? That's essentially zero confirmation transactions. I can now run away with your car and repeat the same with someone else. It's called double spending.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:24:20
Guys, it's happening! ��
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:14:29
That issue is solved by the Lightning Network, which allows instant confirmations. Or am I missing your point?
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:25:07
Having a rough day, huh?
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:48:08
I would recommend just using the offline version to generate a bip84 derivation key and then write down the keywords somewhere safe, and storing it in multiple, if possible distant locations. You can also use a passphrase in combination with the keywords, so if someone comes across the words they still can't access your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-08 07:06:30
I'm rather risk averse; this isn't something I would be comfortable with, but thanks for the suggestion.
@_date: 2019-05-07 01:43:01
What kind of business? E.g. do you need to do a lot of small transactions, a few big ones?
@_date: 2019-05-14 02:45:23
We likely wouldn't. My guess however is that at some point, once crypto becomes widely used as a currency, it wouldn't be treated as property anymore.
Imagine millions of people using Bitcoin at Starbucks. How would the IRS realistically go after every taxpayer? They wouldn't be able to do it, and would have to admit Bitcoin is now used as a currency.
@_date: 2019-05-07 03:11:58
The easiest way might be using a phone and a LN wallet like Breez, Eclair, or Bluewallet.
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:54:21
Samurai isa not my favorite wallet for the UX, but it's ok. I use sentinel to monitor a cold wallet nonetheless and find it very convenient and safe (since you only use your public address).
@_date: 2019-05-03 23:05:53
Yes, you need to use an LN client. You may want to give Breez a try (it's an Android app, I believe it's coming soon to iOS). Please note transfers to the main Bitcoin chain may still take time, but you'd only have to do it once in a while when you want to convert your bitcoins back to fiat. LN payments themselves are almost instant. Think of it as accepting many cash payments, and from time to time going to the bank for a deposit to your main account.
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:55:01
Bakkt is not launching an ETF and does NOT depend on an SEC approval. They are going to offer future, and depend on CFTC approval. And other BTC futures were approved previously. I understand your point revolves around physical delivery of bitcoins, but I don't this would be a concern in and of itself.
