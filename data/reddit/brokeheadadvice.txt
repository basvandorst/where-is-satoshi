Xcc   was a frowny face... XD
I was referring to BCH,      right after I pulled out it went up %7
No one's fault, I was just mentioning it,      
With about 2.5k  in   that was around 150.  200 bucks.   
I didn't lose anything,  just missed the price increase. 
Plan on switching over to BTC here when it gets lower to 10k.   It's closer to 11k atm
@_date: 2019-07-23 16:04:53
Mmm what is the date of the next halving

New buyer here  ,  everytime it drops a little low near 10k   I buy more.   , 
My speculation and hopes,  I really hope it doesn't go below 10k for extended period .       I'll settle for 11k  12k  13k.

There's typically a reason for everything. 
There's actually alot going in globally relevant to the economy.
China, USA regs, btc market dominance, hash rate increase, mention on Bloomberg,   etc
Which of those are, actually relevant, and may have an effect... No one can say.  
But to say,   nothing is happening and it's just a pump because the whales.. 
You only point that I can agree with is it went up 25% over the week, why buy now.  
If you read my original post that you commented on, you will have read that I did buy earlier,  I've just now decided to double down.

That's quite normal fee,      
Should it be m. No.. But it's commonplace and widely accepted
@_date: 2019-08-12 19:34:53
Same ,     I actually lost 5 bucks overnight.  
Run run
@_date: 2019-08-04 17:10:13
Same boat    
I'm waiting.. personally for the time being.      
If it goes up,   I'll wait for another dip...     I'd like it to be closer to 10 though hopefully 9    not waiting for a 7-8

U got me
@_date: 2019-08-03 05:14:53
I think it's quite clear I have my trust in robinhood and truly believe 4chan the hacker will not steal all my monies.  
Jesus christ,    would you like me to tell you about the nuclear EMP blast that's going to wipe out the internet... And make bitcoin obsolete... No... piss off
Robinhood FUD
@_date: 2019-08-03 02:03:27
I don't believe that Robinhood can steal any investment made,   flat out.
Your telling me if I put 10k in Verizon through robinhood,  robinhood can just up and take my 10k investment.... 
And also, not have any legal recourse. Not buying that.
I don't mind if I can't touch any bitcoins because I'm not spending them,  I'm strictly investing on the price.
I feel like it's equivalent to me warning you that there could be a nuclear blast that would wipe electricity off the Earth and your bitcoins will be non existent.  Which I'm sure you've heard before but simply shrugged off.
I see your point,  how ever  for me it's not practical.  I'll take my chances...  You know Verizon could go bank rupt too and the phone I bought won't have service... 
Edit    not to mention,  if your saying I never had access to bitcoins to begin with.... Then why threaten that they can revoke my access to the bitcoin.?

They don't share the same ideals as us,       to the plank!!!!!
Funny I'm sure they have the same exact reactions when someone links an article from here over there.
@_date: 2019-08-03 01:23:44
I use robinhood,    but I have no intention of spending bitcoin. 
I'm putting money into the hopes that the price goes up.
When it does, I will then sell for profit.
Works fine for me,  very straightforward
@_date: 2019-08-16 02:21:35
So you don't have any idea what your talking about.... 
Got it ��
Could have,  should have,,, would have....
@_date: 2019-08-04 17:06:46
I refuse

Your right,    the ignorance here about  the power wielded by those in control of the economy, is..   Almost....
Fairytale like,      
There's no way an inch of power is going to be given to crypto over 
Fiat by those who want to maintain the status quo.   
 
I'd use the term fight tooth and nail.   And it seems to be received as a figure of speech here....
No.. Sorely mistaken,      atleast from the general statements I've read here. 
Once again,  you are right   above,  
Bitcoin has the potential to be king �� , but he's still a vulnerable infant at this time.
@_date: 2019-08-05 02:42:54
Me   hoping for low 10ks  
Still have money in now though,  so  win win
But it's never enough
@_date: 2019-08-02 17:27:43
Sounds like fun,
Over my head, but   someone out there worth their salt will be rewarded ��

Insert prophecy here
@_date: 2019-08-03 13:21:33
FUD    FUD,  
With trump as president, the chance for war increases one thousand fold for nuclear ⚛ options. 
Its more likely than you think.
@_date: 2019-08-12 19:33:43
@_date: 2019-08-05 03:14:56
I'll rephrase it for you   
I have  .11 bitcoin     what's the safest way in the world to hodl it, I'm deathly afraid of the 4chan hacker. No0b to BTC but very excited
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:47:25
I need another dip    I missed the last one     ��
@_date: 2019-08-08 21:06:46
By your math....
Bitcoin is one of the best performing assets in history. 
Your starting point is directly from an ATH.... 
Have you starting point when it was founded... And the numbers are increased by Thousands of percents..
You can't just say from 2018 it's down 45%....   Okay it's up from 2019...
Just moving around a dates to get a percent you'd like is easy.  I can do it too

Free speech    free speech    
Any censorship or caveats,
Is not free speech.  
Just be honest guys,  you want to live in a world that is child-proof with pillows on every corner.

For some reason     ,   I've received comments from folks here
Disliking this method,   I don't really care tbh,  works for me. 
I guess their some sort of bitcoin purist or something
"not your keys, not your coins"
I'm just here for the profits
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:20:22
Doubled down at 11950.
Feeling hopefuly for 12k +
Just watched it zolm threw  11k yesterday    not gong for that again
@_date: 2019-08-05 22:58:36
And lied to them.. with zero repercussions.... 
Same with Google...

It took years to conceptualize and perfect.
I give it to others freely though.
@_date: 2019-08-05 02:19:56
So don't invest in it.. Oo?
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:23:03
