Yes it does. You can normally use the txid as a normal ID, except when there's someone re-sending the transaction with a different hash. So you'll do your tests and everything will look fine. You can even do these tests on the Bitcoin test network and you'll be fine (unless there's a bot there purposely changing those transactions).


Sure, but one could come at the conclusion that the developers considered the chance of collision small enough to use it as an ID.
These 'trivialities' have now been in the spotlights for days have brought down multiple exchanges.
Maybe you would never have fallen for such an obvious trap, but many others did. In my book that's enough to consider something as not being as evident as everyone thinks it is.

@_date: 2014-02-13 18:28:22
I wouldn't say it's an incompetent or poor choice.
When you program something and the function of a library you are using returns you an "ID", you expect to be able to use it.
Especially if it works like an ID in all the tests you've made.
Here you have a function that returns you something called an ID, works like an ID, smells like an ID... Except in some corner cases.
Could they have been more careful? Sure, but in my mind, this setup was a huge involuntary trap for programmers.

Well, the devs might reduce the anti-spam minimum after the recent surge in value. However, you should not see this as a % in value; it really is a fee  on the transaction itself, regardless of the BTC amount.
You can send transactions without fees by the way, but miners might decide to not include them in the next block.

@_date: 2013-04-06 19:26:27
Ok. So you plan, in advance, to spend a coin. Some seconds prior to the actual purchase, you send the transaction to a part of the network to which the store isn't collected (10-100 nodes away perhaps?). This was done by a *simple* network analysis, of course.
You buy the coffee, sign a new transaction, and send it to other nodes (supposedly closer to the shop's). You then say thank you, turn back, and *hope* your other transaction won't be transmitted to the store's node and/or that it won't trigger a doublespend alert.
Sure, go ahead, free coffee for you! :-)

I feel targeted, as I clearly said that I would buy if I wasn't already so much invested.
However, one must make the distinction between the short and long term. Short term could be bumpy (down OR up). Long term? Never been more bullish.
Some say we are in a bubble, the crash will continue, blablablabla... You know what? They might be right. Long term however, I don't think it matters really much. Do you think Bitcoin has a huge potential? Do you think it received the *best media attention ever*? Well, now's an occasion to buy at ~60% the price it was 2 days ago. Can it go lower? Sure. It might also go higher and never return.
In addition, those are only my opinions. Bitcoin could crash and burn tomorrow to never return. Still, I don't feel like ending all my posts with "disclamer: I might be wrong".

Goddammit guys, what's with reddit and being able to read? I never said botnets and malware were a good thing!
Of course a malware is BAD. I'm simply pointing out that what you're doing with it might be better than the alternative.
To use your slave analogy:
- Option A: use the slave to detonate a nuclear bomb in a metropolis;
- Option B: use the slave to build a hospital.
Obviously *both* are bad, but one is lightly less evil. Can you see which one?

This can't be upvoted enough!
I listened to a *Free Talk Live* cast live from the Bitcoin convention and there was a segment with a Ripple guy.
I was scared by 2 things:
* Everything in Ripple is an IOU. Someone defaults? Too bad!
* How well marketed the IOU problem was.
@_date: 2013-06-14 21:49:53
BTC if you like the default acronym chosen by the market.
XBT if you want to try to play by ISO 4217. 
(BTW, ISO 4217 doesn't use the metric system by default when talking about PMs, but rather uses troy oz. I'd prefer not using a standard that promote non SI units.)
I'll stick with BTC.

Governments have been around since way before the income tax (temporary war measure my ass...), or sales taxes.
They are a smart bunch... always finding new ways of taking your money:
**IF** Bitcoin forfeits the income tax, Hallelujah! But that's not going to be the end of states or taxes.
While I'm absolutely against taxes, I agree there's many degrees of immorality to them. (The worse of course being the income tax.) IMO it makes much more sense to tax someone on what he decides to consume then on what he produces.
In summary, don't worry about your government disappearing because of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-04-24 00:16:47


The correct answer is: stop making stuff up. Not everyone is indebted. You can be poor and have a positive savings rate. (Even if inflation is a disincentive.)
By having inflation, you are making sure that more and more people are driven towards debts. Then you'll say "See, we must have inflation, because of all those who have debts!".


This is where your logic is flawed. Having a financial instruments *denominated* in a currency isn't the same as having the currency. For example, I could hold $1k worth of gold and somehow be inflation-proof. Again, wealthy people aren't just sitting on a pile of cash. (They *can*, temporarily, when it's advantageous)


No it's not. You need to save before you can consume. Wealth of nations are built upon generations of savers. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 20:57:06

I understand your point, but even speculators help Bitcoin. They drive the price up, consequently helping to finance various Bitcoin projects.
New high price also brings media attention, which is one of the best way to spread the idea. Bitcoin has been around since 2009 and it seems that we have yet to penetrate the mainstream.

@_date: 2013-04-26 06:14:41
Not so fast! :-)
The biggest question currently on bitcointalk/dev is if the blocks should have a size limit. (The current limit was implemented as a temporary protection against spam.)
Blocks size not only affects storage cost, but also bandwidth. The more important the requirement for these factors, the more 'centralized' the cryptocurrency might become. But at the same time, if you want people to be able to use it, and not only some professional financial institutions, you must leave enough room in the blocks...
More info [here](
So yeah... the extra block size might have an impact.

This guy has a real problem with Bitcoin.
I've already [discussed]( (see the comments) with him, but each time I refute his argument he just ignores it and move to another point.
His latest grudge (Bitcoin is seen as an investment not a currency, thus it fails...) completely disregards that *even if it was true* (which it isn't; many/all currencies are used as speculative investment), Bitcoin can still be used as a payment and financial protocol.

@_date: 2013-07-27 18:53:47
Yes and no.
Say for example that the miners (for whatever reason) decides to exclude Bob's transactions. Even if all the nodes accept them, the miners have the last word on this matter. Sure, the transactions are relayed, but they are never included in a block and thus never confirmed.
This is how miners can veto so much in the network; they can decide to exclude someones/somethings from the blockchain. They do not, however, have the last word on what POW the network is using, because this part is not dependent of any inclusion in a block.

"but at the end of the day you can only take their word for it"
No you don't.
I'm really impressed by how much easier AND secure things are now compared to 2 years ago. (Last time I did a paper wallet)
Blockchain.info might not be AS secure as a paper wallet, but it's almost equivalent to having bitcoin-qt. (Provided you use a long wallet password, of course.)
Also note that a paper wallet has many downfalls. It makes you vulnerable to meatspace theft, fire, lost...

It was a rhetorical question. People like to see manipulation and dark motives everywhere. Why are orders being placed when the price go down? Because someone wants to buy. Why is he not simply placing an order? Who knows. Perhaps because he risks creating a buy wall, increasing the bullish sentiment, making people buy for just a little than the price he is willing to pay.
If you want to really see orders and market depth, I would suggest  over bitcoinity.

Funny thing...
Yes, climate change exists. Climate has *always* been changing.
But the Climate-change-folks often make many assumptions:
1. Human can impact the climate.
2. Current climate variations are created by human activities.
3. A human induced climate change will make the planet warmer.
4. A warmer planet is bad. (If you look at a world map, you'll see huge surface of land in the temperate and frigid zones.)
While these are all possible, the immediate jump to "human induced climate change is bad" is worrisome.
Happy to provide dissenting opinions. :-)

Fees are 2 folds. First, they are used as anti-spam (artificially maintained at a minimum of 0.0001 BTC). Second, they increase when the *storage* of your transaction increase. For example, if you need to combine 0.001 + 0.001 + 0.002 + 0.003 to make a 0.007 transaction, you might pay a higher fee.

You are pointing a new user to an application that requires to download the blockchain (happy next 12 hours...) AND that can potentially have an unencrypted wallet AND that doesn't do an automatic backup.
Point new users to blockchain.info, please!

Although there's many wanna-be investors here that sooooo much want a higher BTC price, there's also those who have been with BTC long enough. I myself started getting invested (morally and monetarily) in 2011. My [business]( started accepting them in 2012 (shameless plug).
Now, I don't critique people for selling BTC, far from it. However it must be told that Bitcoin is still a **very** small market. Many of the newcomers see a 30% crash and panic. Well guess what? It WILL happen again. And again. And again.
Those too emotional will sell when the price is tanking and buy when it's rising, effectively buying high and selling low. That's bad!
Of course most of the circlejerk here don't know to transmit effectively this idea. :-)
@_date: 2013-04-26 18:07:02

Importing the private key is really easy in blockchain.info. I don't remember exactly where, but there's a section import/export... it's there.

I don't know if there's any easier way, but you can use pywallet to dump your keys.

This. I don't see what advantages Litecoin have that would explain its price. People are buying it, thinking they missed the Bitcoin boat. (Which they didn't, by the way... boat still docked.)
Bitcoin has the first mover advantage. It has the network effect. And behold, it also has an amazing team of core developers. Litecoin has some tweaks, for example the block creation speed and the maximum total coins, but nothing *fundamentally* different. 
"Litecoin is silver to Bitcoin gold" is just a marketing trap. With precious metals, you need to have multiple value metals to enable smaller transactions. For example, try to pay for a coffee with gold... durr durr.
Now, in the future, we might need another tool than Bitcoin for smaller transactions (this has to do with block size, transaction fees, etc.), but I highly doubt that an entirely separated new blockchain is the answer.
IMO, if you want another crytocurrency, use Namecoins. At least it provides decentralized name resolution.

Of course you should issue a tax receipt for the BTC donations.

Fuck you.
You take info from a csv file and batch it into a pdf ready to be printed?
You have an incredibly small market:
Those who needs to print some shipping labels, that are using desktop spreadsheets, but can't bother themselves to program something to transfer that into a PDF. Somehow, they also need to print enough of these to justify the use of your product, instead of simply doing it the long and hard way.
Now, does that market exist? Perhaps. Will you find it on reddit or bitcointalk? No. Your customers are the 'omg-excel-can-do-everthiiiing' folks that all tech people hates. You can find them in your average office. However, they usually already have some shipping scheme. Furthermore, they are not your average Bitcoin user.

@_date: 2013-12-04 14:11:30
What many seem to overlook here is that *Bitcoin is also being pumped*.
"Let's convince X to accept Bitcoin!"
"Hey, there's some crisis in &lt;some country&gt;, let's talk about Bitcoin!"
While long term my money is with Bitcoin (or until a truly superior alternative arises), there's plenty of dubious personalities talking non-stop about Bitcoin and saying how it could be worth $10k-$100k a piece.
I remember when we were &lt;$100, many did the calculation to see how much a Bitcoin could be worth if we took various players' places. Western Union, Paypal, Visa...
Well, in the thousand(s) range, we have already reached some of those estimates. And keep in mind that those were *IF* Bitcoin took their market, which is nowhere close to being done. 
Another often overlooked point: the network is not ready for mass adoption. Not in the ease of use, nor in the basic technical capabilities. We are approaching the current block limit, traceability is chipping away at the fungibility of a bitcoin and the blockchain is getting really big.
We are 100% surfing on speculation from non-technical people who don't really understand Bitcoin.
If I hadn't my coins already, I would be very nervous about buying now.
Edit: grammar!

@_date: 2013-04-07 17:48:31
I've recently written on the topic:
The reason using colored coins are interesting for a stock market is that it allows you to use the security of the blockchain. Not everyone has access to a fully developed stock market, but Bitcoin is available everywhere.
It also gives you the opportunity to own shares in a foreign company. Remember, not everyone lives in a place where having a retirement account linked to a worldwide stockmarket is the norm. This way, you could have a young adult in Africa investing in Google. His local government goes to war? Bitcoin user unaffected :-)

You can't use "hence" with only a subgroup of the group you are talking about.
Indebted poor aren't all the poor.
Inflation is *absolutely* encouraging people to get indebted. So yeah, it helps those who currently have debts, but it's also what's driving them to get some in the first place. 


Yup. And like I said, the wealthy aren't holding large amounts of currency.
Why would anyone save, if whatever they can save is eroded away by inflation?
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:16:27
It is worst because when you produce but don't consume, you increase the capital available for you or other entrepreneurs. (In a socialist viewpoint, you could say that you increase society's capital.) Yet, you are penalized for doing so. You also reduce the possible ROI from investments. I could decide that opening a factory that would give me 10%, but only 5% after tax, is too much a hassle for what it gives back.
It's also easier to tax for 'luxury' when you tax consumption. On the other hand, when you tax income, you don't know what you will end up harming. I, for example, have a genetic disease related to muscular dystrophy. Soon, many jobs available on the market will be out of my reach. Well, I know I better start saving for my old(er) age much sooner and much aggressively than the average individual. To do that, I can cut my spending to a minimum. What I can't do, however, is reduce what the government is taking from me, because it's directly related to how much I make.


How is someone with more money requiring more defense?
Does my bank account cost more money to defend than someone who has 10x more? No...
Does the rich guy with a Ferrari in his garage more susceptible to theft than me with my car parked in the street? Not really...
Does the guy owning a ranch without a soul for 1 mile around need more protection than the student living in a cramped apartment in a questionable neighborhood? 
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:07:20
Which means that each confirmation would be worth a lot more. Individuals would include higher fees to be sure to be in the next block, further providing incentives for the miners to mine, regardless of energy consumption.
"Jimmy, fire up those old GPUs!"
Not a desirable situation, but not the end of the world.

bitcoin-qt will automatically create a new change address each time. Thus, you won't see your remaining BTCs on your blockchain.info account unless you add the new private key generated by bitcoin-qt.
If you fire up bitcoin-qt, you should see your BTCs as expected.
You could also simply send them to your blockchain.info address directly from bitcoin-qt.

If you want to understand the technicalities, I highly suggest this: 
To get used to handling bitcoins, I recommend a web wallet such as blockchain.info. That's right, *not* bitcoin-qt, unless you know what you are doing. Once/if you have an important amount in bitcoins, you can transition to a more advanced kind of wallet (armory?).

It's easier for the newcomer to just use blockchain.info with 2 factors authentication.
At least while there isn't many bitcoins involved.
Otherwise you'll end up with people backing up their wallet, but not realizing that the bitcoin-qt uses new addresses every time. They might use a paper wallet and bitcoin-qt will send the change to another address. They might also simply get a trojan on their machine.
Really, bitcoin-qt is *dangerous* for newcomers. There's too many things to know to use it safely.
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:05:17
[Not sure if...](
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:57:23
Another way to look at it would be that the blockchain will be 4x BTC's size.
Also, if 10 min is too long to confirm, it's mostly because you need a quick transaction (buy a coffee of something). 2.5min won't cut it either.
LTC could have something to it, I just don't see it.

What you are describing is basically a double-spend. If being careful on how you broadcast these transactions, you could fool part of the network into thinking you have sent to an address, while the other part think you have spent to another one.
This is why it's important to wait for confirmation for important amount. Your double spent *would not* be included in a block; a single transaction would.

How many bits in a byte?
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:59:19
Interesting. Could you give a link? I would suppose the markup is non-trivial.
*Edit: burned by your edit :p
@_date: 2013-04-21 05:25:45
Yay! Now I can see the non-volume on Bitcoinity :-p

"The dollar will never fail."
C'mon, this is just BS.
Every. Single. Fiat. had the same fate. Or perhaps are you suggesting that *this time it's different*?
Policy passed and agreements made? For sure. But how does it prevent the dollar from failing? None of these policies protected the past currencies. Not even death sentences.
And at what point do you consider the USD failed? Is it when the name is changed, or when it loses 90% of its value? Do you consider the pre-Nixon dollar to be the same as the now gold-less-one?
It would be in the best interest of *almost* everyone using the dollar if it wasn't inflated. And yet...
So, again, how do you stop it from failing?
In return, you ask what prevents Bitcoin from failing: nothing.
It does, however, have every characteristics required to succeed:
- Limited supply;
- Potentially anonymous;
- The most secure ledger in the world onto which you can bootstrap other financial services;
- And best of all: force proof. 
Now, how can I believe that the USD is more at risk than Bitcoin?
I *KNOW* the USD is doomed. Bitcoin, at least, still has some hope.
Do I have all my assets in bitcoins? Of course not! But I have none in USD.

But how would that be different than selling 1BTC once, instead of 1000 * 0.001?

Bitcoin is not supposed to be used for micro transaction. It might be possible *now*, but in the future the fees might be too important to use it with this purpose.

There is a part of [ISO 4217]( that is used for precious metals.
However, it doesn't use the standard kilogram metric measurement: it uses *troy ounce*.
Also, it's supposed to be only for countries... but somehow the Euro ended up with its own symbol (EUR) instead of XEU.
I guess that if you're are 'politically important' enough, you can warp the rules.
This norm is a joke.
But I fully support [ISO 8601](

What do you mean be careful? It's not like I can do anything about it.

Stop using Internet Explorer.
And Windows.

You *can* send without a fee, but it must a custom transaction. (Not all clients support this)
@_date: 2013-04-19 23:24:28
I think it does. Clearly an important part of the media stopped laughing at us.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:21:37
Wait... why is this on @_date: 2013-04-12 04:42:10


Not after the huge shift from the media towards Bitcoin.

blockchain.info is bugging out.
You can validate that blocks are indeed being created:
