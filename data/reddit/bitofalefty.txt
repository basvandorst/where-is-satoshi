You're right of course

1) The error was only in the 'back of an envelope' calculation which led to  the 20MB figure in the first place. In the code it's very explicit I think - MaxBlockSize=X or similar
2) There is an altcoin used to test out these things. It's called the bitcoin testnet. The problem is that it's very difficult to replicate the economics of bitcoin with a test coin since there are so many independent players with different motives in the real world. A lot of the unknowns are in the realm of 'what will group x do in this situation'. These questions can't easily be answered when the test is largely made up of the developers themselves. There may well be some useful things to learn however. Maybe there will be a meta argument about whether to change the main testnet over to 20MB
3) The number of nodes will probably shrink a bit whatever. Going back down from 20MB is a soft fork, no hard fork required. Then it really is just a case of convincing half the miners to ignore big blocks. This scenario seems unlikely, though. Even if a spammer did immediately fill up the blocks, most nodes would be able to handle it for a while. If the spammer kept it up, they'd spend lots of money to achieve not very much
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:00:32
In this case, a single mining pool could ~~block~~ veto the update if they have over 5% of the network hash rate (several do).
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:48:44
It's not about the legality of blocks, its the fact that the trigger is based on blocks in the main chain/longest chain

Transaction must either have a minimal fee or some priority. Old coin transactions and large value transactions have priority and therefore don't require a fee, but it's difficult/expensive to use old coins or large value transactions to spam so practically speaking a small fee is needed for each tx, so spamming does cost money

The latest proposal is for 20MB
@_date: 2015-06-11 09:34:21
Background: Block size *limit* (max block size) is the threshold at which miners and nodes will completely ignore a block (invalid). Individual miners have a setting for the size of block that *they* will produce, which can be anything from zero kB up to the max block size. In the current core software there is a default limit ~~just over 700kB~~ of 750kB (see graph) which many miners hadn't changed until this point. This chart shows that these pools have recently allowed their software to produce blocks close to the maximum that will be accepted by the network.
Interesting! I wonder what the main motivation for raising their default was was
* Pressure from pool members to operators
* Direct benefit to pool operators
Due to any of the following:
* Fee incentives (I think the fees in the mempool got to around 0.5BTC?)
* Fear of damage to the ecosystem through delayed confirmations
* Fear of 'collapse' of the system by e.g. memory running out
* Warm fuzzies 
Interesting too that there are lots of zero transaction blocks. I assume they're not all insta-blocks with no time for txs in between. Are there any entities known to deliberately mine zero tx blocks? Are they solo mining operations with nobody to answer to?
@_date: 2015-06-11 11:13:38
Interesting. I wonder what the ramifications of this would be were the practice to become commonplace. If blocks took a significant time to validate it could lead to larger reorgs, if a block is found to be invalid later. Any idea how often invalid blocks are mined in bitcoin? It's an expensive mistake so I would guess not very often.
Edit: this would effectively reduce the capacity of the network by increasing the prevalence of zero blocks, too. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:03:31
Find the transaction you sent in your wallet and copy the transaction ID (in core, right click and copy transaction id). Search for the transaction in e.g. blockchain.info. If the transaction has been mined, it'll say so there and will say how many confirmations it has. You can also look up the current balance associated with the send address. If it never sent, send it again making sure to include a high enough fee

Bitcoin whitepaper - Satoshi Nakamoto
@_date: 2015-06-22 19:57:30
You're right that timestamps can't be relied upon short-term. However, for a node to accept a block, there's a rule that the timestamp must be within something like 2 hours of its own time AFAIK. Therefore, there's a strong incentive for miners to get their block's timestamp about right lest their block be rejected.
Similarly, as the limit gradually increases, miners won't want to push right up against it (because of this ambiguity), otherwise their block might be rejected, so there's some leeway there too.
Note that these scenarios of block rejections are 'soft' in that, after time, the blocks become valid again, but they are unlikely to be on the main chain because they were ignored when first mined

Out of interest, what happens if there is a reorg after the new limit is triggered? Is it sticky or continually recalculated?
Assuming a decent rate of adoption of the new software the ratio of block version numbers is unlikely to tip 75% then revert for any period I suppose

At any one time, exchanges don't hold the majority of circulating bitcoins. Once a govt started to buy, a lot of people with BTC would think yay price rise! and hold on.

The problem with distributing the storage is that the core client needs to query the blockchain frequently in order to verify transactions. This would mean fetch requests going over the network, significantly increasing the bandwidth requirements. Also when new blocks arrive, how do we decide who stores them in a distributed system? It starts to get very complicated very quickly. Much easier if everyone just stores the 20Gb, which is 2% of the largest SSD available today.
@_date: 2014-12-14 21:00:48
'Real' nodes will disregard any received message which doesn't follow the protocol. Therefore, all the 'malicious' node can do is implement the proper protocol. If they used a different protocol, that would be a fork and effectively a new coin. The only thing they could do is not pass on transactions. As long as a few good nodes exist, the transactions should still get to miners. The transactions are very potent in that respect

First of all this is a 'release candidate' and the 'final' version hasn't bee officially released yet, rather the devs are checking for last-minute bugs. 
In terms of version you can keep running the 0.9x versions in the sense that they are compatible with the latest version. 
However, it is generally a good idea to keep up with the latest officially published version when security updates have been implemented. For example, Bitcoin Core version 0.9.1 contained an update to remove the 'heartbleed' vulnerability.
@_date: 2014-12-05 22:46:53
Sure. Explaining this will involve going into a little depth about what the 'crypto challenge' is. Firstly, the concept of the sha256 hashing function. This function takes an input and outputs a number (a very big number). The input could be a single letter or the holy bible, the output will always be a number of a fixed length. A given input will always give the same output. Crucially, even a tiny change to the input *completely* changes this output number. There is no way to 'game' this hashing function to give you the number you want.
The 'crypto challenge' is thus: 'find an input to sha256 for which the output number is less than X' (This threshold X is the difficulty). The only way to do that is to repeatedly try different inputs until you get an output number that is low enough. The winning 'answer' is that input which gave the low output number. When you reveal the answer, everyone can instantly check it by running the hashing function once, and making sure the output number is low enough. Part of the input has to be a hash of the previous block which you can't predict, which is why everyone has to start again once a new block is found (you can't just store up some winning inputs and use them when you want).
Obviously it takes MANY tries of different inputs to get an answer low enough. To prove to the pool operator that you've been trying, you simply show the inputs that give numbers that are quite low, but not low enough to win the block. Make sense?

Many nodes are part of some other system and therefore require more effort to upgrade and incur some risk of introducing bugs. If the upgrade doesn't provide tangible benefits to the operator, they may choose to skip that version.
One would hope that, for a consensus critical change requiring a hard fork, node operators will be more keen to get things sorted ahead of time.
With a hard fork, updated nodes are set to implement the rule changes at a certain point in the future (specified at a particular block height). This gives time for node operators to get on board before the change happens

For those interested, here is an ELI5 as to what a block withholding attack is.
First some context; if you understand how mining pools work you can skip this paragraph. Mining bitcoin blocks is really hard, because the crypto challenge everyone is trying to solve deliberately has a high difficulty so that only one person in the world solves it every ten minutes. Since there are many many miners, this makes it very unlikely that any one miner will get a block in any period of time. In fact, it is entirely possible that their mining equipment won't find a single block in its useful lifetime. No Payouts at all! The solution is pools, where miners join together and use their combined computational power to try to solve the same problem. The pool, with its large hashing/mining power finds blocks more frequently than any individual miner would have done. When to pool finds a block, the profits are distributed between the miners. Yay! But to do this fairly, the pool operator needs to share the profit proportionally to how much mining power people were devoting to the pool. How do they know this? When the miners are trying to solve the pool's problem, they will keep getting answers that are somewhat right, but not completely there. It takes effort/work to get these dud answers, but they aren't proper block solutions. However, these dud answers can be used as proof to the pool operator that you've been trying super hard to find a block for the pool. When (very rarely) a miner DOES find the correct answer to the crypto problem, the miner hands it over to the pool operator, the pool gets the block reward, profits are shared an everyone is happy. Hurrah!
A block withholding attack is where a miner (or mining entity, shh) offers up the dud answers to get the rewards, but, if they actually get the correct answer for a block, they don't hand it over to the pool operator. Doing this is not directly profitable top the miner - the answer is specific to the pool - but if blocks are regularly being withheld from a pool, profits are being shared with people who aren't really contributing. The profitability of that pool then falls, because less is paid out for a given amount of effort/work/dud answers. If the profitability of a pool is lower, people will switch pools.
Possible reasons for doing this include:
* a pool screwing a rival pool in a dastardly manner
* a miner punishing a 'bad' pool
* (arguably) to damage bitcoin
* Some people just want to watch the world burn
Is it worth posting this in a git glossary somewhere anyone? It took a whole 10 minutes to write..

I am suggesting that the utility of the wallet itself is  actually (or was) an incentive to have the client software.
I agree with you about bandwidth concerns. It's costs like these that put people off, especially when, other than the warm fuzzy feeling of running the client, there's no other benefit. We (those interested in the strength and success of Bitcoin) want people to WANT to run a node, rather than merely 'have no problem' with doing so.
A lot of effort is focused on the incentives of miners (for good reason). I think people run the client for much more subtle reasons but that the same logic and approach could be applied to encourage useful behaviour
What ideas do you have as a game developer that could make the core client fun?

If the pools don't declare that they have mined the blocks, they can be anonymous to the network. You know how you can instantly generate a new address for yourself? They can do that too!
Also, banning them goes against the bitcoin ethos of not having a central authority (e.g. the bitcoin foundation) controlling the network. Better if the system itself is more robust.

Correct. The whole point of the blockchain is to synchronise the transaction ledger. It can't be done otherwise, and if it could, we would need no blocks or miners. It's not a flaw, it's the whole point of the blockchain.

A significant amount of error correction will be required to that small dropouts can be corrected. Google parity bits and RAID. Another option is to broadcast a delayed version on a different frequency for less chance of missing the transaction.

Yes having the same hashing power as the entire network called a 51% attack and the idea is well documented. There are some good discussions on that and I'd recommend googling. Some of the main arguments against the suggestion such an attack might work include that, if some entity were to perform a sustained attack, the rest of the world could hard fork to a different algorithm, rendering the attackers machines useless. The power is with the consensus, and that is one of the main philosophies behind the inception of Bitcoin

What happens is that some transactions will not be confirmed until subsequent blocks. This happens all the time - miners can choose to leave out transactions if they wish. The transactions are normally picked up in a later block by another miner. Problems will arise when the AVERAGE tx rate approaches that set by the current  block size limit. The software will be updated to fix this, but its a pretty major change so it will take a lot of work AFAIK

Its a shame that people downvoted you and didn't bother to reply. The issue being discussed here isn't that the block chain is too large to store. Almost the opposite - at the moment there is a cap in the code in how many transactions can be processed per block. This is to prevent a naughty miner from publishing a massive block forcing everyone to save it. However, there are now so many transactions on the network that this cap will eventually limit the network. It was always known that the cap would need to be raised, and it looks like that point might come in ~6 months [speculation]. If we hit the cap without raising it, miners will be forced to be more selective about which transactions they include in blocks, so the transaction fee needed to get a transaction processed in a reasonable time will increase

Hi Guys, great project. What mechanisms are you intending to use to prevent spam listings? 
Once an entity has a good rating the clients can include them by default, but new users could struggle to get their listings seen if there is a crude filter on zero feedback users.

The block halving will be more significant than any one of those difficulty adjustments, but nowhere near the whole. Let's say on average difficulty goes up 20%. 1.2^104= 171731352. A 171731352 fold difficulty increase is a bigger deal than a reward halving 
@_date: 2014-12-20 12:07:04
Topic explanation for those unfamiliar: 
At the moment there is a cap in the code dictating how many transactions can be processed per block. This is to prevent a naughty miner from publishing a massive block (inflated with made up transactions) and forcing everyone to save it. However, there are now so many transactions on the network that this cap will eventually limit the capacity of the network. 
It was always known that the cap would need to be raised, and it looks like that point might come in ~6 months [speculation]. If we hit the cap without raising it, miners will be forced to be more selective about which transactions they include in blocks, so the transaction fee needed to get a transaction processed in a reasonable time will increase.
The reason that changing this limit is a big deal is that most people on the network must agree to the change (it is consensus critical). Let's say 1/3 of people don't agree with the change and carry on running the old software. When a new large block is published, they will ignore it while the other 2/3 accept it. This essentially creates two versions of bitcoin and is called a fork. This is why its important that the majority of participants are on the same page so that most of the value of the currency remains on one side of the fork

Are LB users an inherently less speculative demographic? For me this calls into question the validity of using the high volume exchanges ~~for the price~~ as a metric for sentiment. Because they are used for speculation, perturbations are amplified so as to make the price unrealistically unstable. 
I have no problem with that in itself, but I feel that there is an assumed relationship between the price on the major exchanges and 'average' sentiment. I'm beginning to question this assumption, and coming to realise the the big second-guessing game taking place on the arbitrage-linked exchange platforms is just a big distraction

Its a bit different because running many tor nodes may allow an entity to discern the origin of a stream of sensitive data.
In the bitcoin network, the result of hosting more nodes would just be to strengthen the network. It might be possible to track a transaction to a particular node but so what? Transactions are 500 bytes; I can send it to a node on the other side of the world with minimal fuss if I want to. Information flowing through the bitcoin network is public and unencrypted

Your points are valid. It's being worked on, it's all about tweaking the incentive structure for miners to include low-fee transactions in their blocks.
At the moment, miners don't like including low fee tx's because it makes the blocks bigger. Bigger blocks take a long time to spread across the network when they are released, increasing the likelihood that that the block will be 'orphaned' (orphaned blocks are trumped by a faster-propagating block that the network sees first). All of this paragraph just means that miners don't like including too many tx's, since there is a cost to them.
Now, some ways of fixing this have been proposed. Recently Gavin has been talking about making block data essentially fixed size, thereby leveling the playing field for 'large' and 'small' blocks. With such a system, it is in the miner's interest to include *any* transaction with a fee (on the face of it). 
Does any of that make sense?
@_date: 2014-12-28 21:38:46
The tx fees are tiny compared to the block reward. Especially if the block came very quickly after the previous one, there may not have been a lot of fee-paying transactions to go into the block anyway.
There is actually a disincentive to include lots of transactions in blocks - bigger blocks take longer to propagate through the network and are therefore more likely to be pipped to the post by another block. This is a problem that is currently being worked on

To expand on what Natanael_L has said, you can't actually make a convincing 'alternate' blockchain without hasjing power comparable to the whole network. As long as the receiver has some knowledge about the status of the 'real' blockchain in the last couple of years it should be pretty obvious if someone is broadcasting a fake. 
What's more difficult to deal with is the censorship of some transactions and the broadcast of double spend transactions. A large part of the network heavily relying on one broadcast (centralisation) is not ideal. Again though, when someone compares the internet nodes to the broadcast transactions, it should be obviously very quickly when something fishy is going on.

Then, if they are in a remote location, they can still make an emergency payment for example. I tho k it's a cool idea. What sort if range can you get from HAM radio?

Of course there is a need for some sort of government, but governments can be too big and too powerful. When this happens, they can abuse that power. For example, they could change tax laws retroactively and debit money from directly from your bank account, without any consent or voting. If people are in control of their own money, it is much more likely that some due process would be followed

Am I right in thinking that the devs are creating an incentive for *miners* to get involved with coming up with solutions to the block propagation challenge?
That's ingenious. There are so many levels of complexity to all of this; the behaviour of each node, the emergent behaviour of the network and the incentive-driven sociological behaviour of all interested parties.
I wonder if miners might create synced 'mirror nodes' that are able to broadcast new blocks to different parts of the network as soon as they receive a valid hash, without needing to download the block themselves

There is a torrent you can download to speed up the whole process. Your node will still verify all the transactions in the node.

Hopefully yes but the doubt would be damaging to confidence in the system. Even more so if there were a more even split. 
In reality it would probably be implemented such that the clients are programmed to raise the cap at a set point in the future. This gives everyone a chance to update before the change and it won't be a surprise to anyone.

This will only happen in the case of a hard fork. A hard fork is just what you describe - an incompatible change in the algorithm which causes the block chain to split into two. Ideally this is only done deliberately and with plenty of warning.
A node operator may choose not to upgrade for less serious changes

You're right I'm not running a full node currently. My ISP-supplied router with crappy firmware seems to timeout or forget the port forwarding rules after a few hours which is very annoying.
Please can you elaborate on what the difference is with a full node? it it simple the number of connections is limited otherwise?
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:42:22
There are a few questions here, let me address them.
If somebody had a massive amount of computing power, they could spend a coin on the network whilst mining their own longer chain. They could then release their longer chain which would be accepted by the network. In their longer chain the would not include the original transaction, and instead they would include another transaction (say to themselves), thereby invalidating the old transaction on this new chain.
Even if you didnt understand that, the point is this. For the vast majority of transactions (sub $10,000, say) there is hardly any risk that someone would 'double spend' in this way, because it's not worth it.
If you send a bitcoin transaction to an invalid address, that s not a bitcoin transaction. Assuming your client even broadcasts it, no node on the network will propogate it. If you misstype a character on a bitcoin address, you won't strike on another address, you will just make an invalid address that won't be accepted. 
If you use the WRONG recipient address by accident, you are screwed. I hope that helps

pre-mining is where the creator of a coin mines it themselves before announcing the coin and allowing others to mine, thereby keeping a proportion of the coins.
Ceasing mining doesn't make sense; mining is the means by which transactions are registered in the network

Do you mean that, as long as any malicious party is only a small part of the network, there is only a minuscule chance that all X copies end up in the same place? That's interesting.

The article implies that mining difficulty drives the price, but it's more complex than that. 
Due to the effects mentioned in the article, miners will join and leave based on profitability, therefore the hashrate will follow the price to some extent (or rather mining investment per unit mining return). 
Some good points but the conclusions seem a bit confused

It might be because now pretty much all mining is done on pools, so people aren't running full nodes, rather just the mining software. Before every man and his dog got into mining solo mining was a thing and people ran full nodes to support this.
Also, there are many more wallet implementations, almost all of them light wallets that don't require a full node in the background

Assuming the average tx fee goes up and your buyer is paying the same tx fee as before, then yes their transactions will take longer to confirm. 
For non-expert buyers what happens will depend on on the software on their devices and what fee that sets. 
All of this is doesn't matter  if you are willing to accept zero conf tx's, so long as the fee is high enough that the tx gets mined eventually

@_date: 2014-07-07 21:09:55
If they are mirroring the block that the 'master' node is creating in real time (i.e. adding the same transactions to the mirror block as the main block), then when the mirror receives the hash it can instantly broadcast the block because it already has a copy that it has been building simultaneously.
It's a harebrained idea and I'd be interested for someone to pick holes in it. I'm not sure how meaningful it is to say that the mirror node is connected to a different 'part' of the network, for example. I'm *not sure that international latency is the main problem.
For some context, I don't have knowledge about the in-depth workings of bitcoin, sadly.

Firstly, if most broadcast transactions are included in blocks the first time around, there won't actually be a large number of unconfirmed transactions.
Secondly, it only takes one altruistic miner to take the small statistical hit and broadcast the cheeky block. Assuming big pools aren't conspiring to do evil by ignoring the block, finding a block is still extremely potent, as currently

@_date: 2014-07-07 18:07:47
It's not a contract. Senders add a fee to a transaction, the miner (unknown at the time of broadcasting a transaction) chooses whether it is worth their while including it or not.
Miners leave out some transactions (even ones with fees) because many transactions in a block means that the (now large) block takes a long time to reach the whole network. This is bad because someone else might solve the same block after you do, but broadcast it faster.
This new code works out what transaction fee makes it worthwhile for miners to include it in their blocks. Crucially, this gives an incentive to miners to come up with a way of broadcasting their blocks faster, which is currently a challenge for the protocol generally

As I understand it, a timelocked transaction is cancelled if a balance is spent from the address before the original transaction unlocks.
The steps are:
* Multisig address established between client and server.
* Client tells server 'here is a transaction for TotalBtc timelocked to be refunded to me if all else fails'
* Client then sends signed signed transactions that, if broadcast, would overrule the refund (so that the server doesn't lose the all the money, only the outstanding change)
* Eventually the client calls quits and the server broadcasts the latest signed transaction received from the client, which overrules the timelocked refund transaction, meaning the server pays back the amount originally sent, minus the sum of all the micropayments
Please can you let me know if this is all correct? This is awesome by the way, thanks for making the video

Nice guide. 
Something I've noticed is that, when running a node on OSX (10.9.3) the ping time goes through the roof whenever the user account is 'locked' or the screensaver comes on, going up to about 10 seconds. I guess the machine is going into some sort of low power mode. The problem is that it isn't obvious at all to the casual node runner. Setting the display sleep to 'never' solved this problem and the latency is now below 100ms. 
Just thought I'd let you know in case you think it's worth adding a note to the guide

Coinbase transactions cannot be spent immediately, I think the rule is 100 blocks after they're mined. This is to minimise the risk that spent coinbase bitcoins disappear if the block they are mined in is orphaned.
The difficulty is that, with Gavin's mega blocks, there will be instances where there are not 100 blocks between the coinbase transaction itself and the spending of those coins. Therefore he removed the 100block rule and fed the coinbase transactions in at the appropriate points so that the descendants of the coinbase transactions can be validated
I'm not sure I explained that very well; anyone else care to have a crack at it?
@_date: 2015-01-06 22:56:00
What's being proposed is changing the maximum block size that is allowed on the network. At the moment that maximum is 1MB and any larger block will be ignored. That does not mean that each block is currently 1MB, more like 400KB on average. By the same principle, increasing the maximum block size to 20MB will not mean that the transaction traffic on the network instantly jumps up to 20MB per block. Computing resources get cheaper over time so on average computers will get better which will offset an increase in transaction volume significantly
@_date: 2015-01-12 19:40:57
While this is awful and ridiculous in equal measure, bitcoin transactions are not encrypted (just signed cryptographically) and so presumably wouldn't fall under this particular law should it come to pass. That's not to say that some other absurd rule about anonymous transactions won't be pushed through.
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:23:25
I doubt they made more than a few hundred transactions though? who knows..
@_date: 2015-01-07 00:33:35
Yep! More recent software can detect this and display a warning.
Interestingly, a lot of the transactions will be processed by both networks at the same time since they'd still be valid on both. New coinbase transactions and their descendants would only be valid on their own chains though. 
After a while I would expect that nodes on the different forks would get grumpy with each other for sending 'invalid' data and disconnect, further isolating the less-backed chain.
@_date: 2015-01-02 01:31:43
Pasting this from a previous post:
Topic explanation for those unfamiliar:
At the moment there is a cap in the code dictating how many transactions can be processed per block. This is to prevent a naughty miner from publishing a massive block (inflated with made up transactions) and forcing everyone to save it. However, there are now so many transactions on the network that this cap will eventually limit the capacity of the network.
It was always known that the cap would need to be raised, and it looks like that point might come in ~6 months [speculation]. If we hit the cap without raising it, miners will be forced to be more selective about which transactions they include in blocks, so the transaction fee needed to get a transaction processed in a reasonable time will increase.
The reason that changing this limit is a big deal is that most people on the network must agree to the change (it is consensus critical). Let's say 1/3 of people don't agree with the change and carry on running the old software. When a new large block is published, they will ignore it while the other 2/3 accept it. This essentially creates two versions of bitcoin and is called a fork. This is why its important that the majority of participants are on the same page so that most of the value of the currency remains on one side of the fork
@_date: 2015-01-11 10:17:48
Exciting stuff! 
The explanation on the site jumps right into trust, deposits etc. Is there somewhere a demo of a normal transaction that goes smoothly? I'd like to get an idea of how people interact with the system
@_date: 2015-01-04 14:25:57
Very cool idea, I wish you the best of luck with it! I have a couple of thoughts.
As I see it, a key challenge will be verifying that file parts you have received are actually fragments of the file you want. This could be doneby checking hashes of fragments against a trusted peer who has verified the file post-download.
Since the cost of each file fragment is low, the risk for the downloader sending a (micropayment) before receiving the file is low. If the file sender does not send the fragment, the client could disconnect from that user having only lost $0.01 (say) and then maybe blacklist for other users, or do something more clever like note the number of successfully received file parts before disconnection.
The blacklisting and trusted peer aspects of these ideas would rely on a robust reputation system based on signatures.
**Incremental micro payments can be built up off the bitcoin blockchain then settled in a single transaction in such a way that the sender can't be ripped off using multisignature addresses and timelocks as detailed** [here](

Isn't the deposit stuff done in the background though? The 15 slides seems a bit verbose for the intro
@_date: 2015-01-01 17:33:30
Good question - the answer is it's not a 'real' address/public key (there is a difference between public key and address but it's not relevant for the purpose of this discussion).
As you know, the 'normal' way of making bitcoin addresses it to generate the private key, from which the public key and address are derived. In the bitcoin software, there are certain quick checks that are done to make sure an address hasn't been mistyped.
To make one of these 'burn' addresses, you simply need to make up the address in such a way that it gets past these quick checks. You might want to include words in the address to prove that it would be impossible to chance upon that address by generating private keys. Because ytou know what the checking rules are, you can customise the address, then add on the necessary checksum characters at the end
This will then get past the checks in the software, even though coins sent there can never be recovered
@_date: 2015-01-07 00:07:26
Yes, but we will run into scaling problems much sooner by bumping against the block size limit. There's no question that the limit needs to be raised. The question is, can current computers handle larger blocks? That's what's been tested and the answer is yes

Well 7 is the maximum tx/s with the current block size, so it will need to be raised at some point as everyone knows.

@_date: 2015-01-06 20:04:19
The software needs to be updated to handle more transactions. Currently the network can only support around 3 transactions per second (7 is the technical maximum for the smallest size transactions). Large payment processors handle *thousands* of transactions per second.

I am not him, but I will give some answers anyway.
The 0.7 -0.8 fork was unintentional and could theoretically happen with any significant update (although the devs are very careful to avoid this and do thorough testing of all new code that could cause a fork)
With a deliberate fork like the one being proposed, the protocol change would be programmed at a block height significantly in the future to give everyone time to update their clients before the change happens. This way there is not a big split in the network since everyone changes their rules at once
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:39:41
Why deliberately limit the transactions when the network can handle being orders of magnitude more inclusive? It's an arbitrary limit at the moment. There are other protections against 'dust' transactions (nodes won't relay them). What's wrong with satoshi dice-like transactions if the network can easily handle it? 
The intent behind bitcoin wasn't to serve only the highest bidder. It's for everyone.

Yeah, miners can screw around. That's why you should wait for a few blocks for very high transactions. If you're selling a cup of coffee you don't need to bother
@_date: 2015-01-06 22:28:00
Good question. It's important that all nodes change at the same time or it would be mayhem. Using GMT or similar is problematic because, for example, it's not really possible to prove when a block was found using this 'real world time'. The way its actually done is more elegant - agree to change the protocol at a certain 'block height'. Block height is just the number of blocks since the beginning of bitcoin. In a way the blockchain is a ticking clock - and everyone knows what block number the network is on. So in the software there would be code that does this:
if blockcount is &lt;400000 { Max block size is 1MB }
else { Max block size is 20MB }
I just made pseudo-code up obviously but you get the picture
@_date: 2015-01-01 12:54:26
I would correct you, but you are correct.
Barring any miner shenanigans or the tx being unconfirmed for so long that it falls out of the mempool, this tx will eventually go through
@_date: 2015-01-20 22:02:46
I'd be more likely to get behind that argument if the network could handle sufficient transactions to be a big player in the money transmission space. Limiting the cap to 1MB would shackle bitcoin into remaining the tiny blip it is now, tps-wise. If it can't handle a large volume of low-cost transactions then bitcoin isn't achieving its raison d'etre

@_date: 2015-01-06 22:06:56
Kinda, but the idea is that you update to the new *software* when it comes out. This software initially agrees with the current/'old' network, then at a defined point in the future it automatically changes its behaviour. This gives enough notice for everyone to upgrade to this software **before** most of the nodes automatically change
@_date: 2015-01-07 00:36:31
This requires trusting nodes to accurately broadcast their versions. We don't like trusting things.
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:58:33
Letting the network itself detect consensus is brilliant. Nobody can complain that the change was forced on the network, and a 50/50 split is necessarily avoided. It does mean a 80/20 split is necessarily incurred, but once it is obvious that the change is approaching one would expect a runaway situation. I would guess the 20% is based on the current number of 'old' nodes plus some overhead.
At first look I thought that the idea of trusting miners' protocol version broadcast message wouldn't work, but the only possible consequence of a misbehaving miner voting one way and acting the other would be the place themselves on the wrong side of the fork. The incentives play out
@_date: 2015-01-24 16:15:41
Good on you!
I would recommend waiting a while until the 0.10 version is officially released - the initial setup for that version is an order of magnitude faster. When it comes out the download will appear on this site:
You can run the current version but initial sync may take a week or so unless you mess around downloading a torrent of the blockchain :s
Whichever you go for, once the program is installed the only mildly tricky bit is 'forwarding' port 8333. Forwarding is just redirecting traffic send to a virtual port on your modem to your computer, and will involve fiddling with the settings.
Once you're up and running make sure to leave it going as much as possible. Note that on macs (and possibly other platforms) the software doesn't run properly when the machine has a screensaver or the 'display sleep' is on, so be sure to disable those and just dim the screen if you have a laptop.
Have fun! PM me if you get stuck

A new version of the bitcoin client will be released very soon.
This new version includes an update that makes the initial sync MUCH faster, such that there is no need to download the blockchain separately.
This version is 0.10 and you will be able to download it [here]( when it's ready. (always verify download links yourself)
You will simply need to install and run the program and it will start syncing and running. It may be necessary to open port 8333 to make it a 'full' node (google port forwarding)

in 2008, the average upload speed in the uk was 0.375mB/s so a 1MB block would have taken something like 20 seconds to get between two nodes. It's now more like 10mB/s so that a block can be transmitted in less than a single second. Times change, and the network can handle way more traffic now than it could before. Think about the future, by the time the 20MB blocks are full, computing will have moved on. The same applies to hard drive space too. It's ridiculously cheap now and will only get cheaper.

@_date: 2015-08-19 19:46:21
Correct, for a short period (hours?) while there are still some nodes on the old chain theoretically some payment processors might accept a transaction on one chain that for whatever reason isn't on the other. In Practice though, most *transactions* will be valid and mined on both chains. Also, since most mining power will not be on the old chain, blocks will take an age to get mined and there will be a huge backlog that never catches up.
All nodes should give a warning of they see a longer chain that their rules won't verify
@_date: 2015-08-19 17:13:03

A useful little trick to view combined subreddits - just add a '+' between the names e.g.

That would be ideal, but the problem is everyone needs to have *precisely* the same max block size rules or the chain splits. There's not an easy way for everyone to agree on the exact figures in a decentralised way. If all nodes pointed to a website for example, someone could attack the website and take the whole network down

It might be good to fork them off more frequently with invalid blocks
@_date: 2019-06-08 20:17:59
No coordination. Random
The pools are using the hash of different blocks as a starting point. Each pool has a block that it is trying to add to the blockchain. This block has a transaction to that pool (the reward), so the blocks are necessarily different between pools. The hash of this block (part of the starting point for nonce searching) is therefore unique to the pool and the search space are different
@_date: 2015-07-25 19:10:47
If you waited for a block to be found before broadcasting your transaction, the time to the first possible confirmation would be ten minutes on average. 
In reality though, transactions are broadcast more randomly than that, so some will be broadcast shortly before a block is found.
I don't know statistics well enough to give the expected time until next block from a random start point (due to the stochastic nature of block mining), buy my guess it that it is closer to 5 minutes than 10

Mining is not really worth it for individuals at this point; you need economies of scale to be profitable. 
Mining needs to be competitive for security, hence the jumps in difficulty as miners try to stay ahead of each other.
This is really the biggest centralisation 'risk' in bitcoin at the moment, but claiming otherwise is better for certain agendas
@_date: 2015-08-20 20:09:15
Actually there are two blocks now. It takes a while for miners to switch over to new pools. After the ghash.io fiasco it took a good few days for miners to move. Pool operators will be very cautious to start and will only change once they see their hash power leaving

It is advised to keep your money off exchanges in general, and instead keep them on a well-secured wallet (like electrum). 
As long as you don't move your coins tomorrow there is no direct risk of losing money due to transaction issues. There is the small chance that an exchange like coinbase could make such a big a mistake that it causes solvency issues.
The best option would be to move your coins to a secure wallet you control and refrain from transacting tomorrow

Do a significant proportion of miners *want* to cause a split for the sake of it?
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:55:07
It seems they both do exactly the same (enforce segwit signalling), but BIP91 does it in a less risky way. So in that sense, it's not pointless, but actually quite valuable? Not sure I'm getting your point
edit: I've read you comments again - I guess you're saying miners have had their hand forced but are now able to make it look as though they're activating segwit of their own free will. Whatever gets the job done I suppose. If that is the case it's a shame BIP148 won't get credit directly
@_date: 2017-07-08 09:27:42
I can't help but feel that if some sort of scaling solution isn't implemented this summer, it never will be, and bitcoin will become less and less relevant.

This article compares the complexity of a 2x hardfork with the complexity of segwit as if they are equal. I suspect segwit is an order of magnitude more complex to implement.
That isn't a criticism of segwit by any means - there's a lot of great work gone into it. But I think it's a little much to suggest that a 2x change is anywhere near as difficult

Conceptually the tipbot control of the coins itself. When someone tips, it keeps a log of which username has how many allocated to it (it doesn't actually need to move the bitcoin at this point). When someone wants to use the bitcoin in their tipbot account elsewhere, they can send a message to the tipbot requesting their bitcoin.
*I seem to remember someone actually said that it makes a webwallet for new users. Either way, the users don't need to give the tipbot their address until they want to withdraw.

If a flaw is discovered, the protocol could be updated to fix the issue. This may have a minor impact on confidence or a huge impact, permanently forking the chain etc. The severity would depend on may things, the damage an attacker did (if there was an attacker rather than a white knight), the time before the fix, etc. Either way, the concept of cryptocurrencies is here to stay in one form or another.

Every time you open it, the QT client you are using has to download and verify all blocks since the last time you had it running. This means if you haven't opened it for a couple of days it can take a while before it catches up with the present. 
Since it does this sequentially, if it hasn't caught up to the present the client doesn't know how much BTC is on your address, so it can't send from it.
The QT client supports the network by verifying transactions itself and re-broadcasting them. If you just want a wallet for sending and receiving, use one of the other ones that don't verify the blockchain. Alternatively make sure the QT client is left running in the background or opened regularly. Hope this helps
@_date: 2013-06-16 09:33:04

Good luck to you! 
One apparently effective way to popularise a site like this is to offer a free service to casual users - like blockchain.info's blockchain explorer, for example. 
A style note - the site favicon seems slightly at odds with the style of the site itself, which is refreshingly devoid of gold coins. Others would disagree I'm sure. Just my to satoshis!
@_date: 2013-11-03 11:24:19
As I see it there are few tangible benefits for the casual user. 
However the QT client is a 'full node', which means that it is doing an important role as part of the bitcoin network. Because it has the blockchain, it can verify transactions that are broadcast (it tells the network 'I can see that this address has sufficient funds to send that amount and i believe this transaction is valid'). It does the same with blocks. As far as I know, the QT is currently the only 'full' implementation of Satoshi's paper.
tl;dr currently the QT client IS the network, and you become part of it and support it when you run the QT.
There's probably some stuff about trusting thin wallets to be on the right chain etc but to be honest that goes beyond my knowledge currently. I don't think this should be too much of a concern for casual users. Someone else might be able to add more detail/correct me

This doesn't really matter. So long as it's feasible for someone to run the QT on a desktop, it doesn't matter that I don't want the entire blockchain on my smartphone
There are however real issues that this article misses, like the looming update to the CORE PROTOCOL which has the potential to create a fork in the blockchain. The block size limit needs to be increased. We're counting on you, devs.

blockchain.info is what you're looking for. I'm guessing it's the most popular online wallet.
Always enable two factor authentication (2FA) with an online wallet. This means you need more than just a password, e.g. you have to click a link in an email or something. It is MUCH more secure than just having a password. People go on about it around here (hi..) because people who don't use it lose their money

Paypal is a big no-no for bitcoin trades because paypal transactions can be reversed but bitcoin transactions can't. Paypal have publicly said they don't support the sale of bitcoins, therefore all the buyer (in your case) would need to do is inform paypal that the transaction was for bitcoin and it would be reversed, leaving the bitcoin sender out of pocket.

It sounds like you know approximately what to do. I would guess that the most common way of making a paper wallet is to use one of various sites that create a key pair (two strings of characters) that you can then print out.
The problem with that as far as I see it is that the site has given you the private key so they could theoretically store that information and empty your BTC. People do seem to be using them, but I would advise that you proceed with caution.
[See here about paper wallets](
Another route is to download a wallet client (a program that you install on a computer). Some of these let you export the private key, which you could then print along with the corresponding address. This could be done offline. Once printed, you can then delete the wallet from the computer.
Whatever you do you want to be fairly sure there aren't any viruses or other nasties on your computer that could steal passwords/keys.

Whatever colour you are, it is a possibility. This is the reason for paper wallets etc that can be created offline. BTC can be sent to the address that was created offline while the private key is still secure. There is still a risk when the money is to be spent.
This is the problem hardware wallets are (or will be) designed to solve

Yeah sure. There are two incentives for mining:
1) Block rewards themselves, currently 25 BTC per block (shared between members of the pool)
2) Transaction fees. There is a tiny transaction fee on most transactions (a few cents) to encourage miners to include the transaction in their blocks. When there are many more transactions, there will be more revenue from transaction fees.
Now, mining revenue is a zero-sum game, that is, there is a fixed amount of BTC being shared between all the miners. This is achieved by automatic difficulty adjusting of the mining based on the TOTAL hash rate of the network. So if every minder doubles their hashing power, the difficulty will adjust so that everyone earns the same BTC as before. If everyone stopped buying more hashing power, the difficulty would stay the same.
If some miners STOP hashing, the reward is split by fewer miners and their incentive increases. It is these market forces which ensure mining is always barely profitable.
In conclusion miners are fighting *eachother* for the reward, and the difficulty increases accordingly when everyone gets more powerful. You'll never get no miners because once a few leave, the reward per miner would jump up and make it very profitable
Rewards are denominated in BTC, which becomes more valuable as it becomes more widespread.

Update: [Apparently it's fake]( but a fun tale nonetheless
TL;DR (As far as I understand it.. feel free to correct)
* Someone posts on a forum (4chan?) that there is an application running that seems to be mining litecoin
* Other forum members appear to be asshats (4chan hypothesis +1)
* One anonymous forum member claims that the running program is part of his/her botnet (this doesn't seem to be relevant to the rest of the story)
* The original poster [extracts some ID from the malicious program]( running on his/her machine. 
* This ID is used to convince a mining pool admin that he/she is the owner of the mining account (that actually belongs to the 'hacker'/botnet creator)
* Pasword/PIN are reset on the account.
* Original forum poster empties the LTC from the pool account, sending it to him/herself. The value is said to be over $2000

Bitcoin needs miners more than ever. People should be aware of what's profitable and what's not, but I don't like the idea of discouraging mining because the difficulty is higher. Miners are performing an invaluable service regardless of profit

Do you know how bitcoin transaction data compares with the characters available with SMS? Is the character limit easily changeable by the service provider or is it intrinsic to the SMS protocol?

The next version of the bitcoin QT will let you download MUCH faster. Version 0.9 is to use 'headers first' downloading. Essentially it means you can download the 'names' of all the blocks first, then the blocks themselves. This enables simultaneous download from many many sources and parallel downloading of blocks, whereas currently you need to download sequentially (hence the download completion being measured in weeks)
I don't know when the release is expected, but until then I would recommend using another wallet if you're having difficulty. Not all wallets are 'thick' - many do not require you to download the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:05:56
Thankfully this is not quite true. A good example is the Trezor, or Armory. Both of these allow offline transaction signing. That is, you set up the transaction with the offline device (offline hardware gadget in the case of trezor, software on an offline computer in the case of armory), then the device outputs the signed transaction. You can the  take this transaction data to an online computer to be broadcast to the network. voila!
I would imagine there will be many more examples of this technology popping up due to exactly the issues you point out

Sure. It doesn't mean a huge amount practically, it's mostly just an interesting metric. Imagine that when you keep bitcoins on one address you start building up bitcoin days. So 1 BTC saved for 2 days is 2 bitcoin days. When you move the coins to another address, then those bitcoin days are 'destroyed' (nothing is really destroyed, it's just that our little game of saving up bitcoin days starts again for those bitcoins). Because all transactions are broadcast to the the network, people can analyse the block chain and see ALL the bitcoin days destroyed over a period of time.

I see. Indeed, it is possible to get a very decent level of confidence within a few seconds just by listening to traffic on the network. Nodes can verify much faster than the ~5 minutes before the next block. [Sauce](

I like what you're doing; there's a big need for it.
I know you're deliberately staying away from the technical details, but I think a general overview can be enlightening and still not be intimidating. something like this:
"Computers connected to the bitcoin network each keep a record of all transactions that have ever taken place. This record is called the blockchain. When you pay bitcoin to someone, the computers update their records to reflect that the person you have paid now has that amount of bitcoin, and you do not.
The whole thing is secured by cryptography (uncrackable codes), similar to the the technology used for electronic transfers between traditional banks. This prevents people spending bitcoin that isn't theirs"
That could be slimmed down a bit, perhaps. At the moment your guide mentions the word 'blockchain' without explanation. Apart from that it's all good stuff. Good luck!

When they are all mined, people are still selling as well as buying. When more people want them, the VALUE of each bitcoin goes up because there is a finite amount. Bitcoins will still be mines until 2140 (many article miss put the crucial '1' for some reason). Hope this helps, say if not 
@_date: 2013-08-09 13:48:28
If this were true, by your logic you shouldn't spend fiat money either, rather invest it in BTC. If you had money earning interest in a bank would you starve to death? People want stuff, people will buy stuff. If people are a bit more frugal then frankly that might be a good thing 
@_date: 2013-07-02 20:58:28
Will it be difficult to get network consensus for any implementation of zerocoin? Considering how a bug in a new version of the QT code caused a fork I would expect miners to be (rightfully) wary of implementing such functionality.
The only way I can see it happening is if a particular implementation is proven sufficiently that the BF adopt it into a future version of the reference code. Why am I wrong?

The client is the firmware of the device itself. All that comes out of the device is signed transactions.
Analogous to the software impersonation though could be hardware copies of the device that contain malicious firmware. When you buy hardware like this you must trust the source
@_date: 2013-10-26 16:15:13
What you say is true, but bitcoin days destroyed doesn't mean bitcoins destroyed. It is a measure of the amount and age of moved coins. If I held 2 BTC on an address for 3 days, when I move those coins to another address, that's 6 'bitcoin days destroyed'. When overall there is a surge in bitcoin days destroyed it probably means lots of coins that had been saved for a while have been moved. In this case it looks like the FBI moving DPRs saved coins.

Digital currencies, like all currencies, are liquid. The exchange can exchange with another exchange and spread the loss over everyone. It's also worth noting that the exchange may not have all the bitcoins that are held in the combined ewallets at any one time

I think you could release the update and it could be accepted by only a minority without issue. It would be very unwise for a minority member to release a &gt;1mB block because it would be rejected by the majority. As has already been said, as soon as 51% have the new version, the minority on the old version would crap themselves and update, lest they be left on the wrong side of the fork when the first &gt;1mB block is released

The term wallet is used to describe something that handles addresses and their keys. It is normal to have many different addresses in one wallet. In fact, it is good practice to create a new address each time you are sending or receiving (the wallet will handle background transactions so it appears that you are just sending from the wallet rather than any particular address). Some wallets allow you to send from a particular address within the wallet but this is sightly more advanced and not normally necessary. Does that help?

I hear that one property of a good hashing function is that the output provides little or no information about the intput. If you change the private key by one character, the whole public key changes. Maybe you already knew this. Can a cryptographer tell us whether ANY information can be taken from the hash in SHA256?
