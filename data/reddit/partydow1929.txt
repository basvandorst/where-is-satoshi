I have no idea what you're trying to say. What's automatic expiry of in the money contracts?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:59:49
Honestly, it would be retarded to attempt to do that. And no, it's not easy to do. The last report, showed traders were short 4k contracts on the CBOE. Contracts are 1 bitcoin. So if bitcoin went to $0 the most the shorts can profit is $50 million. That's nothing in the grand scheme of wall street. People are selling because they want to lock in profits or are losing money. It's up 10x from last year. I would want to lock in some money too if I got in at $1000.

This is the Commitment of Traders report compiled by the CFTC. They put it out weekly. Shows how many contracts are short/long, and changes from the last report.

I'm still really confused, because you're using option terminology for a futures contract, and I've been trading both for a decade. Futures don't have strike prices, and aren't considered in the money or out of the money because they don't have strikes.

How does this relate to bitcoin? I've been trading futures for a long time, and this isn't anything new. It's about time some of the bigger outfits get charged with it, but why post this? Spoofing is illegal in futures, but it's not on bitcoin exchanges. People spoof all the time on GDAX to try and move the market directionally.
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:47:32
What about all the spoofing on bitcoin exchanges? I get the sense that manipulation is okay if it drives the price up, and bad if it lowers the price. Also, I don't all CME futures expiry fascination when bitmex has 6 times the open interest than them, and those are actually settled in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:33:49
They are futures, not options. Options expiry tend to have a much larger effect on stock prices than futures have on their underlying asset. Large traders in options may try to move the underlying prices so their options don't expire worthless or do depending on the position. Futures traders will just roll their position to the next month in most cases. Also, with the size of the open interest in the bitcoin futures it would be counterproductive to try to move the bitcoin market for such small positions. Of all the possible catalysts, futures expiration would be my last in order of importance.

If anyone wants to watch them in real time and practice trading them  offers a two week demo account.

[Deribit]( I've only traded the futures, but I know they have options. They are priced in bitcoin which can be a bit confusing. But I do like that the futures are in bitcoin so I just add to my holdings rather than converting back to fiat all the time.

Why would anyone listen to you? You lied about buying 250k in Apple options. Lost all your made up money, and live streamed it with a wolf mask, and acted like you lost your life savings.

CME is closed Saturday. Opens on Sunday at 5pm CST.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:35:14
Wrong. It was a million worth of calls sold. If it hits $50k, they will be worth 13 million or so. That's a million dollar bet to win 13. There is a Bloomberg article on it.

How do you plan to provide enough liquidity and market making? From what I've seen from other btc pms, there is almost no volume, open interest, and the spreads are too wide. 
And a question about  and replicating 'real-world' portfolios. These would all be settled in btc I assume, right? 
 If I short a binary at 0.20 in the amount of 1 btc, would I have to put up 4 in the exchange's wallet as margin requirement? 
@_date: 2014-04-01 00:34:33
Interesting stuff. Thanks.

Considering Bloomberg Terminal is like 5k a month to lease, I doubt they believe enough bitcoin traders would fork over that kind of dough for a platform.

His co-founder is hedge fund manager at a firm that currently oversees more than £1.3bn ($2.16bn). For now he wished to remain anonymous, however, as he is yet to leave the firm.
That sounds sketchy. Why would a hedge fund manager step down from billions in assets under management to work with £5 million?
Maybe he thinks this market will explode. I don't know. But for me, when a mobile product designer thinks he's a hedge fund manager is awfully reminiscent of people thinking they can flip houses a few years ago. Good luck to him though. And just because that reminds me of bubble markets, doesn't mean prices won't go beyond their all time highs after a bubble has popped. It's happened a lot.

Damn... here I am doing that for free. Just be an argumentative contrarian. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:10:52
Not to mention any track record. Buyer beware I suppose...especially when the guy selling it to you is wearing a suit. The article says £5 million not 50 btw.

Bitcoins are backed by products and services? Like a currency is? huh.

Trading in gold futures is way more advantageous compared to trading in physical if you want to speculate. Say I think gold is going up, I buy ten coins from a dealer and pay a fifty dollar premium per coin. The price goes up and I want to sell. The dealer will pay me less than spot, and ebay will take fees out. My profit is severely eroded from these factors. So I buy a futures contract where round trip I pay a $7 commission and there is someone there to buy it and sell it near spot price. Trading a bitcoin futures contract would give a speculator like me little advantage over trading the physical market except for leverage. I do think they would be nice for miners who can within reason say they are going to mine X amount of btc and want to hedge that production in the futures market. But the way I see it is you already have an instantly delivered product inside a market with liquidity. So you really don't need much of a paper market. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:50:15
It's a cash settled contract. You can't take delivery.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:03:40
I don't believe so. That's not how the other products work. For instance, if I'm short corn and it goes limit up, I'm still short the next day when the market reopens. It could go limit up again at market open the next day. So it's possible to lose more money than you have. In which case, the clearing company covers your losses to pay the counterparty, and comes after you for the debt. They don't settle it at the limit price.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:19:15
It's settled in cash. Unlike most other commodity contracts. There will tend to be divergences between the contract and the spot price. I don't think it will have the effect you think it will; if you want to manipulate the price there are far easier and more effective ways.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:29:53
He has no idea what he's talking about. The very nature of a futures contract is it's margined. So YES shorts, and YES leveraged longs. I can short 125k of gold with 5k on the CME. That's the initial margin for the gold contract. Dude is the one who needs to do homework.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:16:03
If it goes up or down 20% the contract is basically frozen unless the price comes back within the 20% range. 
Traders (Individuals) are hedging. The CME is just the venue, they don't trade. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:18:32
All orders above the 20% limit will be rejected. Orders below the limit are still accepted. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:13:10
I've never understood it either. One of the rules of trading, is cutting losers and adding to winners. Dollar cost averaging just adds to your losses unless it bounces up soon. It doesn't work that often because if you keep dollar cost averaging it means its in a downtrend.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:32:18
You can short on Deribit or Bitmex. I'm sure there are others too. They are both bitcoin based. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:42:39
I know man. The blame on here is delusional. Been trying to tell everyone that the futures volume is so light it doesn't matter. Nobody wants to admit the actual shenanigans on the btc exchanges, and maybe it was way overbought in the short term. The stock market stays levitated because CBs can print more to support it. When a bunch of people get rich on an asset it makes it harder to do so, not easier.
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:41:17
One method is called "spoofing." It's illegal in other regulated markets. Basically, if I want to buy btc, I would put in large sell orders that I don't intend to execute by canceling before they get hit. The bots will sometimes offer below the larger order and hit your buy order.
