Sell the BtC to someone you know and have them PayPal you ?

Yeah I’d agree with that, but it’s still inflating, even though it’s indirectly basically

I understand your explanation but I disagree. When a fork occurs, it creates a new supply of money. If the price of the price of the original coin doesn’t drop, and the price of the forked coin greater than zero ... then the sums of them is greater than what you had before so you’ve technically increased the supply of currency. Air drops are a prime example of inflation in Blockchain.

Allow me to explain : Coin 0 has a Blockchain Coin 0 is worth 100 dollars per coin and the supply is capped at 100 coins. Coin 0 then has a hard fork, now there is coin 0 and coin 1. What is supposed to happen during a fork is the new coin takes some of the old coins value in order to start the chair, so this coin 0 should now be worth 80 dollars and coin 1 should now be worth 20. Notice how the total value still adds up to the original. If a coin forks and the value that it borrows from the original chain is more, this causes inflation . For example : coin 0 is worth 100. It forks into coin 0 and coin 1. Coin 0 is worth 100 dollars and coin 1 is worth 100 dollars. Quantity was now just made out of thin air, which is the same thing that happens when governments print money. If you don’t believe me, watch Andreas Antonops video entitled”Forkology”
Does that make sense or did I explain it poorly?

Commenting because I own a crypto related business and this would be great for us!

Buckle up boys and gals, the Bull Run is on it’s way.

Were at a stalemate , because I think it does increase the supply and you think it doesn’t. Let’s accept the fact that we won’t convince the other our opinion is correct? Haha I’ll compromise with you, it doesn’t cause inflation but it’s perceived value that gets blown up.

Fantastic. In with the legit, out with the utter shit.

Google how broken the Paris Agreement Carbon Credit system is broken. I would love to see a Carbon Credit Cryptocurrency that runs on a Blockchain so we , as citizen, can hold our governments accountable to their carbon emissions.

The longest and most dominant Blockchain will always be the most secure because it has the least chance to be compromised by a 51% attack. So even if all these new and “better” blockchains come out, they are inherently not as secure as Bitcoins Blockchain. 
Also, Charlie lee said it himself. Big reason why LTC has done so well is due to how they branded it the digital silver , in comparison to Bitcoin being digital gold.
Keep up the good discussion!

It’s important to note that, more often than not, inflation still exists in Bitcoin in the form of Forks. When a coin forks it sometimes does cause inflation, so be cautious! 
Love the picture tho, the fed can suck me.

You have some great points! My counter argument is that people should have the freedom to be smart with their bitcoin and they should have their freedom to be stupid with their bitcoin. If they understand the risk of investing in an ETF, let them. But if it falls like a house of cards, let them bite it. This is the precise reason 6 months ago I started a company that specializes in crypto education for college aged students. 
The crypto community needs more education infrastructure!

But then there would be no competition. Competition drives innovation. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:46:48
Here is the issue I see: in the current system, one address is paid the block reward once a block is solved, that’s the coinbase. If we moved to a system where individual miners were payed proportional to their hash power on the network, there would be no coinbase. The new block would instantly be filled with millions of transactions that are paying out the miners for the last block. Doesn’t really make sense to me logistically.

I didn’t see it say “Intro to Bitcoin” , it said “what is Bitcoin” and then explained it in a simplified way. I agree, If it were just advertised as an intro then that’s fine ... but it wasn’t. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 18:07:56
I don’t agree with people over simplifying things for the sake of mass adoption. Look what happened in 2008 when bankers simplified Mortgage backed securities. In the long run over simplification of Bitcoin will hurt consumers. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:38:40
So you would rather have miners compete, than have pools compete? Because right now basically pools compete with their hash power.
