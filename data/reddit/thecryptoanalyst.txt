Create an exact replica of BTC that pays the miners in fiat currency from the beginning. The transaction concept is preserved. It is an extremely cost effective Paypal is what the whole project boils down to.

What about grabbing some altcoins. Not too much but lets get some diversification in the space.

If went BTC went to 10k you wouldn't be on here asking how to spend it. Did I hear an "ALL IN"? Good luck fella.

How much cash would you carry in your pocket?
You should use cold storage for your larger amounts. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:10:51
Im In!

Pure cold storage... As much as you want really. The amount you hold in the account is public information, so there is a direct correlation between how much you have in a wallet and its security.

You think BTC transaction costs are bad?  Try to send $.10 with PayPal. How about a wire?

Its cool to get your feet wet in the market but not for longterm investment.

Nothing worth doing ever is. Keep the faith!

If fiat is the most accepted means of transfer of wealth then a Rival system paying in fiat from the beginning is exactly what BTC needs. If you choose to deal in fiat then use the Rival system. If you choose to deal in a decentralized unit, then deal in Bitcoin. 
A fully respected fiat BTC equivalent will always lose to BTC in terms of cost because of the profit required by the Rival system. 
So we would have 2 systems. Fiat based charging $35/$1M and BTC charging $15/$1M. The consumer could chose either method. Some would pay the extra small fee to transact in fiat. Some would pay less and accept the hassle required to transfer to fiat. 
Here is my message to PayPal...

LocalBitcoins for small transactions.

Selling begets more selling. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:11:38
Wow. Right on the mark 
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:15:38
It would be monsterous

Agreed for a one off transaction. I am talking about micro transactions on a consistent basis.  
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:37:09
What does this mean?  The site is being hacked?
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:01:18
Ty SN. Its actually kind of addicting. And I stay on top of the news!
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:26:29
What defines a friend to friend transaction?  What is the limitation?
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:47:30
Will be monitoring. Thank you for heads up
