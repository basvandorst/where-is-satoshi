Howdy, project developer here, feel free to ask whatever.

Again, its about the code, not about the hardware I have, I don't get the point. By the way, customer is always right, when his requests are reasonable, and I don't see why I shouldnt show you my workbench.

Thank for your feedback.
I could show you my workbench, but I don't think it's what you're asking for. 
There are no "pictures" of AVM, cause there's no AVM, there isn't (and will never exist, ) a factory of AVM, it's a DIY project. 
Project of the case will be shared, if the last goal will be reached and the engineer will be paid for his work. Then everyone will be able to give it to a technical study to build, wherever in the world he is.
We're talking about code, and it's on Github, take a look :-)

Hi, 
just follow the Github repository, if something will happen, it will notified there.

Thank you for your feedback: I don't have any know-how about this law stuff, and maybe saying "KYC" is overweighting AVM functionalities. 
I don't claim in any way that fingerprint reader is KYC-regulatory-compliant. I'm editing the README right now to be more clear about this, until some lawyer (if any, here) will clarify about this issue.

We haven't in plan a templating system right now ;-)

I don't think we can put on the same level fingerprint reader I choosen and the Robocoin vascular scanner made by Samsung (I guess). 
This means that Robocoin could be KYC-regulatory-compliant, and mine not (or vice-versa, but I think it's hard). 
About the validity of using a vascular scanner in a KYC environment, I think the producer (again, Samsung) should just answer this question, finally.

Misstyping! It's a "two way" ATM, so yeah, it will support both buying and selling, with some limits:
You can fill the choosen hardware with 30 * 1 banknote type, so for example, you can buy up to 1500 eur of Bitcoins, if filled with 50 eur banknotes. This also mean you'll buy only pre-fixed amounts, set by the AVM, and based on 50eur multiples at change.
