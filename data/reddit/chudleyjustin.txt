Can always instant buy on cash app if you’re that desperate

Is it from coinbase? Visa and Coinbase had an issue with a 3rd party causing a bunch of random charges, they’re being refunded pretty quickly though.

Cash app, it’s like Venmo it’s an iPhone/Android app for sending money. They let also let you purchase/sell BTC without any fees and instantly. To actually transfer them off cash app you need to get verified though which can take some time.

Definitely not 
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:40:24
Definitely not. You can transfer to your bank account without any fees in 1-3 days or instantly for a dollar fee.

Damn. I paid for a semester of college with bitcoin gainz and was happy about that. Lucky guy.

Well to be fair we kept hitting near 8500 the past two days and couldn’t break it, so the wall moved up, it’ll move up again

Tons of people use it. It’s minimalist. I don’t personally use it to buy BTC, just to send people my share of dinner bills or what not. I just know it’s a feature on the app and it’s probably the easiest/fastest way to just buy straight BTC. Use that information however you’d like.
