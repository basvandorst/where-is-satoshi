I know for a fact that a Capital One Quicksilver card does not charge a cash advance.  I think that all of Capital one cards do not.
I have been trying to get more information on this subject, but I don't have much more than that.

No they charge a very small fee

We should lobby them to accept BTC donations.

I don't think the Newegg discount is happening anymore.

I bought $10 in bitcoin yesterday, using Circle, with a credit card.  
It was instant.  They charged me 29 cents extra as a fee.
I'm looking at the prices right now.  Preev.com says $411.1
Coinbase says: $409.53
Circle says: $412.32
I don't know about you guys, but I think the convenience of not having to wait 5 days, and being able to use a credit card is easily worth a few dollars more (for a whole bitcoin).

Yes, Circle works, it's very quick and easy, and instant, any mom can do it

Does anyone have any proof that Satoshi has used that e-mail in years?
I think his e-mail address expired, and this guy grabbed it in time.  Now is trying to earn some cheap money out of it (and sort of half assing his attempt).

The same thing happened to me just now.
Clearly they have a bug in their system for accepting bitcoin payments.  
And fuck that, they are a business who is accepting money, they should either refund it, or give the product.  Just because it is a new currency doesn't excuse them not give you a refund.  
Also, I normally use my regular wallet, but I decided to try using Coinbase's wallet on this one.  And the transaction was an 'off blockchain' transaction.  I was not expecting that, nor do I want it.  I'll pay the fee to put it on a traceable, public blockchain.

Barclaycard does charge a cash advance.
Capital One does not.  
I would like to know more about more cards.

Have you gotten any traction with this?
They have not replied to my multiple support tickets. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:46:26
Glad to hear it

Do you believe this about a soft-fork?
I am with you on the hard fork issue. Don't know what to think about if it is fatal with a soft fork. (Don't support any forks personally, but it's not really up to me, is it?)

The e-mail address is broken. 
I'm skeptical about this
@_date: 2015-08-06 16:44:48
The e-mail address is broken.  I just tried that

I don't know where people get these numbers.  
@_date: 2015-08-13 19:27:35
Yes, exactly.
People act like artists didn't sign contracts to allow their label/distributor/retailer to spend money helping them get their music out there.

Wonderful pr.  Maintenence as a cover for stopping a promotion.  Then rewarding people who complained early?
