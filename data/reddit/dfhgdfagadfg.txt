rofl bitcoiners still think this is a good thing. sure its nice if you're interested in getting rich by doing nothing but sitting on your ass and throwing money into your computer, but as far as a useable/workable currency? rofl. never going to work. you will never have the liquidity needed to get anything done in bitcoin. never.

rofl you can use google to prove any stupid theory friend. I can prove flat or hollow earth theories by using google. what is your point here? that the US is going to implode because google said so? get a fucking clue. maybe instead of "googling it" you should try going outside and getting a job. 
you know whats basic here? you.

or the intelligence necessary to get a basic concept across apparently. 
god you guys are fucking stupid. I can't believe you are real people sometimes but here I am again being blown away by the dumbest people in the room.

anytime someone uses a phase like that I can rest easy with my 100% assurance that they have downs and should not be taken seriously.

oh look its that bullshit "bubble phase" chart again. 
you wanna know the funny part guys? bubbles never recover from the "blow off" phase at the end of this chart. it so cute how you all just fill in the blanks with whatever you want to see though ;)
