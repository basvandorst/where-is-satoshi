Two things.  Using the internet from anywhere in China for anything you remotely care about is simply too dangerous.  Every hotel wi-fi, airport wi-fi, etc… is not safe and in most cases very malicious (DNS hijacked, trying to push down "updates" to windows, flash, java, etc…).  Our company constantly has issues with people's machines being compromised when traveling to China to the point we give out loaners and wipe them as soon as the person is back.
Second.  Always use two factor authentication where available.

Update: Coinbase confirmed it was due to the DDOS attack that is going on.  They credited my account the amount of bitcoin that amounted to the USD of the transaction.  So no loss in value from my end.  Response was quick, email response in less than 12 hours from when I filed the ticket.

Yes, have just over $1k in limbo since 1/7/2014. Have had a ticket open for a week now. They said it would be credited to my bank in two days. That didn't happen and they said wait till Saturday and that didn't happen. Last message was it will be credited "shortly" and please keep checking campbx.com. That was over 24 hours ago and nothing. Starting to lose confidence I will see this money again.

No email from them other than the usual you have received BTC into your account.  I have done several sales and some larger, dont know why this was cancelled and at the last minute.  Now coinbase is showing any BTC or $$ in my account.

Several more messages to the help desk and nothing.  Looks like I am getting the silent treatment now.

Sounds like you have some malware / adware on your computer.  Do a scan (preferably from a bootable USB key).

Great... I have over a $1k in limbo as I started an ACH and its been slow to arrive.  They said to wait two more business days...  They were really good up to this point, hope they get it fixed.

Got a reply back at 3:45am EST.  Funds went back into my account, was able to convert to BTC and move them off the site.

Have been impacted and have not received funds.  Have received the run around for over a week.  First wait two business days, then wait till saturday, then please wait it will be in "shortly", and my last reply on my ticket has been unanswered now 24+ hours.

Update: Money was returned into my account just now and was able to buy BTC and transfer it off campbx

Do a search and read up on the ACH threads.  They are most likely about to turn into the next Mt Gox.  Best for you to pull out what you can as fast as you can.  Turn it top BTC and withdraw while that still works.

You should not use campbx.  They are having problems and have been untruthful with their issues.  ACH / Wire transfers have stopped and they are not returning money into people's accounts.
@_date: 2014-02-19 10:47:55
I used them to trade LTC for USD a little over a month ago.  Used money order for the withdrawal and it worked well enough.  Not sure if I would want to use them for large amounts, their fees for wire transfers are pretty steep and I don't trust having that much tied up in a money order.

The main page said it is completed and everything was fine:
However the details say cancelled:
@_date: 2014-02-01 07:08:47
The thing is I have been having issues since the 7th with withdrawals.  They kept saying it was due to their updates...

At which point do you think we should start filing suits in small claims?  They have continually lied and missed deadlines to return funds and now they are not responding at all.  Getting worried that they are insolvent and / or about to close up shop.
Edit:  Money was just returned into my account and was able to buy BTC and transfer it off campbx
