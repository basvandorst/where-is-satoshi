bitstamp is a Roger Ver company.. You sure you want to do that?
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:29:40
great work! just wanted to say, i'm working on one similar but different.. Just so you know, I'm not trying to copy you. :) Good job on your tool very much needed. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:40:18
Perhaps I'm mistaken. Records updated!

Just above bitpay bro, same link, 2nd to last.

According to price and community, it's at least 15% of the bitcoin community, even as a minority it has value to a sizable community.
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:49:35
can you have a setting to switch between the two?

I think that's the question.. What is consensus? There are 4 parts to it right? Miners, Business, Users, Developers. 2.5/4 signal they would like it 1.5/4 say they do not. Hence, 1 hard fork happened already since 'consensus' was not met. Now, with those remaining in BTC, the community may sub-divide again, because people, business, and miners think there needs to be a block increase. So what it seems to many, like myself is there is resistance by the code maintainers to act on consensus. If it does split again, then that would be 2/3's and the minority would've blocked actual consensus right? By centralizing code decisions that everyone else relies on, then how can there be a real consensus?

I get it, but doesn't that mean they still need to audit the existing inventory to determine how many BCC|BCH coins they would have to put on their exchanges?
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:34:42
This is how i see it.. :)
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:42:59
i'm running a BCH full node on a pi 3. It's easy enough.
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:33:42
Lightning Network and RSK Rootstock work on bigger blocks too. The main difference is the hub won't work.

Social skill and reasoning exists in languages other than English. Also, code speaks for itself. Better coders write elegant code that doesn't confuse the reader. It doesn't have to be in English for developers to understand. Math is a universal language. Coding is its own language. That's why contributors are around the world. Better code speaks louder than better English. Let me put it that way.

Internal audit.. all the coins held are considered assets right? If the new coin has have value, it's important to know the number of coins held. On an exchange, they would also need to know how many they need to trade on the exchange. I'm saying solvent or insolvent they need to do an audit as an exchange. It's a $4 billion market cap, I think they would like to know how much of that they have on the books and add it to existing inventory for trading.

glad to see free market and decentralization at work!
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:31:54
Like I said, I get it. It just seems highly unlikely for an exchange. Of course there are different kinds of exchanges. I think it saves them a step by supporting it now. Not only do they stop withdrawals they bypass deposit issues too. Seems like a good chunk of people want to sell right away and best way to do it is leave it right on the exchange. Sucks for Coinbase|Gemini for withdrawals but good for bitfinex, bittrex, kraken. Since people get to trade the moment it's ready to go without withdrawals and redeposits without taxing resources like customer support and UI. I see the point for onramps offramps exchanges but for market exchanges it's a benefit. 
Edit: lol downvoted for telling the truth... go figure. The topic is still auditing all btc exchanges for actual holdings. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:54:04
You do know code is based more on math than it is english right?  
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:46:27
They are exchanges? I think it would be normal process to audit and see how much inventory there is for the exchange, but like i said i get it. It's more for projection purposes since they're an exchange. That adds a lot of value to the books if you're holding x number of coins @ $5-$300. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:34:17
ahh. I think they all would audit books during the maintenance time. Either way, only reason to leave it on an exchange instead of the wallet is to trade it as soon as it opens. Buy or Sell. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:53:51
Very good. You are reasonable. I see the split as "decentralization" bitcoin is a protocol that can be used in different implementations. Bit"coin" was centralized and now less. Personally I don't think there is as much support for 2x now that there is Bitcoin Cash and the only real way 2x will come to fruition is if SegWit proves too slow for users, specifically settlement. Then they will have to move to 2x, and also why I see Core Devs leave room for 6-12 months down the road. No matter what there will be centralization somewhere in the logistical chain. Appreciate your thoughts.

There's something fishy to me about bittrex and the stairstep drop and controlled inventory. It looks like some orders are removed off the books. My order was taken out from the buy book even though its open, there's no record of my * next to strike price. It seems like bittrex is controlling the release and purchase of bcc. Hence why we're not seeing a straight dump. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:14:31
I don't get the bridge reference. I sold because of the big difference in prices between the markets. If you were in bittrexx, it almost seemed dumb not to sell there when the price was discounted by 50% everywhere else. I'm actually waiting for the big drops to come but they aren't, which is why i commented. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:38:50
I just built one, runs well
@_date: 2018-06-04 18:46:19
Thank you for this explaination.

If you honestly believe what you're saying, there's nothing to worry about. ✌️otherwise, I do think you should worry. Without business support this goes from being a power house to a hobby again. So many have wanted the Chinese miners out, well nows the time it's all gonna happen. Everyone will be on the fork they want to be on. Win/Win/Win. So don't worry. Things will go the way they go. Just because an experiments ends with one test group doesn't mean the experiment stops. It just means the experiment has moved on. No harm no foul. Will you stop using crypto as a result? If so, then your belief system was never really about the movement it was more about a brand.

So customer sells funds in exchange for funds on lightning to be used to be sent. The funds on the channel are still LR responsibility.  They've basically become a moneygram/wu which would require money transmitter license. Right? This model mimics that entirely.
@_date: 2018-02-16 04:22:13
We shall see! Good progress is testing limits.

Very novel implementation, didn't get any response on twitter so I thought I'd bring it here. Specifically [here]( for authorization and [here]( for a log of all your records
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:09:17
Surprised no one mentioned at 5:00 the list of invoices kept on the LN node. Anyone who uses the service will have all their transactions monitored. Also, by giving permission as shown, you allow them to view all your account records and log all your transactions. The only difference is he setup a lightning sub-lease account in the main business coinbase main account. If its a single account where all btc gets funneled it gets pooled with other users as the reserve grows, all the while, this app has authorization to debit x $'s per day. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:01:29
This is the way I see it as well. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:27:56
It's an LR hosted channel, how is it not under LR? LR requests the debit, debits the account, credits the LR channel, initiates transfer, transfers, settles account. It could work, it's a novel idea, but I would still lawyer up. I wanted to do something similar but have to be careful because you're sending money for someone else. If you are not a custodian or transmitter. What are you and how would you define the system? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:18:34
Incorrect. SegWit, did not remove unnecessary information from transactions. They replaced it with a pointer (backward compatibility) and moved the information to another section. There is still a signature. The signature is necessary or it would've broke many more things. Remember its like a check, and a check is nothing without the signature. The hardfork Aug 1, was to keep the original chain intact with onchain transactions. After Aug 1, with segwit locked it it forever changed the structure of the block because of segwit support. Bitcoin Cash scales onchain, where segwit puts signatures to the back of the chain. The move to bitcoin cash was to scale, not copy. It's already proven it can perform with low fee's and high throughput, the longevity of the chain is still TBD. 
2x is a compromise with both onchain and segwit. It allows for more tx's to clear on the main network while allowing for transactions to use segwit. Segwit is slow for onchain tx and is fast if you move your btc to a segwit address and don't use the main chain. The settlement will happen at a later time when the signature catches up to the block when its mined. 
The theory is, small blocks will continue to get slower and slower to  process because of more transactions, but to offset that more transactions with slower blocks means higher fee's to get priority. Unless you use segwit and a side chain line LN or Liquid. Then you pay those network fee's and they subsidize the onchain fee. They become the bink (bitcoin bank/balance keeper) and aggregate all the small transactions until you close the channel and write to the main chain. 
2x, will lower the fee's and improve the speed overall and allow more people to use it.  Right now Less than 5 million active btc users across 27 million wallets. If its going to scale to 10 million active, some people think it needs to grow. Keeping it small will keep it slow and more expensive but that's how high worth assets are.  People will decide what bitcoin is. digital asset, currency, or combo of both.
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:58:58
I would lawyer up for this. The fact that you specifically ask to debit the account to put into your reserve to spend fractionally makes your system the custodian.
