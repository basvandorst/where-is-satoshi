Keep in mind there is both ways of doing it really - the creator does put their own address in there description so you can give it to them that way or use the donation button there but that goes to the "pool" - up to you.

Good suggestion. The creator can turn it on for "free download" but I paid download would be good agreed.

Yes, had the similar idea in mind. They can send bits of bitcoin to either spin the player or stay on the site for xx amount of time.  The part about copyright owner collecting a accrued balance is good also.

*No*, this isn't how it works. Your donations are spread out, they don't necessarily go to the most-watched videos! where did you get this?  The person you like most, if they add more original content get tilted more toward them vs. just "most-watched videos" . Also, read my "edit".

**Edit:** Another cool idea we are thinking is original video creators could create clickable overlays in their videos so people can donate bits of bitcoin directly to them.

The idea is this:
* Original content wrapped around Bitcoin's ability to reward the creator of video through bitcoin tips on the site.
* Exposure of Bitcoin as the most effective way to reward creators.
* Also, rewarding people who even curate videos to the site.
Do ask more questions! Thanks.

Yes, I should have mentioned this is where this idea sprung out from. How do we as producers as content share in the profits. Youtube is a talent grab making billions from others work. I'm totally open to ideas how to better distribute bits of Bitcoin to more people. I've already distributed bits of bitcoin to some of the creators so far. Most of these are curated video which is what I expected and its fine. The real kicker will be original content. Thanks for the feedback.

Are their really videos you hate ? I mean think about it your donation as encouraging more people to bring good content to the site thus giving better videos to everyone. Not only that everyone is finally getting a piece of the pie.

Hi! Thanks DanielTaylor - Yes, that is a good idea to come up with some kind of bitcoin bounty for the best original content good thinking!
