This guidance makes innovation in NYC a non-starter, as always. From Web 1.0 through today NYC gets it wrong. Then they wonder why the Valley gets all the talent and money. Nevada and Texas will likely benefit form NY's misstep. The sad part is that NY had it sewn up. It's the financial capital of the world and could have led the charge globally, given enlightened guidance.

Accessibility, indeed. This thread title presupposes that I want to spend my time marketing something that is already a closed game. The big players have massive stores of BTC so 'who' am I really doing 'what' for? BTC will not save the world, it will provide greater profits for established players. Other platform like Ethereum will change our relationship to distributed computing. Altcoins are a different thing - you can actually build your own economy, and provide financial access where traditional 'money' can't (or won't) go.
The question should ALWAYS be what Bitcoin can do for US. And if it's us doing all the work and large concerns reaping all the benefits them it's really not a 'thing' at all, but a gigantic (and free) product lab for the usual suspects.

This was a great panel. I wish we had more time to dig deeply into advanced decentralized business models but for the first one, it was a really good intro into future-thinking in the music space. Everyone had good things to say about it and there were some high-level coders as well as music execs in the audience - it made me feel great that they also thought it was a meaningful  discussion.

Well... given the ridiculous unicorn environment in the Valley, they may take Uber blacks around town, but they own Ferraris for the weekends. This is just substituting one ruling elite "club" for another.
