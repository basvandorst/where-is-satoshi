Don't get me wrong, I love bitcoin, but I love alt coins as well. Not the plain cloned alt coins, or scam premined ones , but original ones with great developers and community helping out. Some functions such as faster transactions , anonymous features, proof of stake if you do not want to spend on mining hardware ... Are useful and help build a better coin.
Bitcoin is the first but it is really expensive unless you are an early adopter mining from the start. I have Avalon machines mining , If you do not have a lot of money or got in really late like most people, you might need to start somewhere. Altcoins are a good start for some people to get into cryptocurrency. In the end probably convert to bitcoin.

Keep up the good work, waiting for more stores!

What did you end up getting? And what did you send it on?

Will you have an iOS app out for this soon?
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:59:03
I never heard of you guys. But will give it a shot. Seems easy enough to do.

I used it now about a dozen times. Great idea and works well. Now I want this for every store!

I just used it. Very quick and easy. It even launched my payment app. I guess it is  using the bitcoin payment protocol, making payments painless.
Just a quick question: how do you make a profit giving 20% off?

Maybe do silent auctions on items with bitcoins bids only.
@_date: 2015-02-22 05:30:34
I'm not sure what you sell but what about having special items that can only be bought with bitcoins. Such as with comics, variant covers , signed by artist, limited edition items, ... 
If the customer wants it they will have to purchase with bitcoins. Maybe word will spread , cool unique limited items for sale with bitcoins only. If the items are desirable, people will spend with bitcoins.
Or another thing is throwing a raffle , every purchase made with bitcoins will get an entry. Drawings at the end of every week/month .
