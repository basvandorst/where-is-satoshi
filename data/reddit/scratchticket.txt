Thanks for the support. We hope to add more than 10 professionally developed games next year. Stay tuned ...

Our company, BitPlay, is currently sponsoring all tournaments (therefore, we are paying for the tournament awards). In the future, other parties will be sponsoring the tournaments - with hopefully higher winning amounts.
@_date: 2014-12-23 18:05:44
We agree completely. Are you a developer? We are always looking for partners.
@_date: 2014-12-23 18:01:33
Yes, I work for BitPlay the publisher (probably should have put that disclaimer in the original post, sorry). We are venture funded and have a longer-term view of our business plan. So for now, we are funding all of the BTC. You can imagine a day when tournaments are sponsored by third parties.

We will not be banned. Gambling requires that you are risking something in return for a prize. Since players do not deposit bitcoin, they simply win them, we are not gambling. Google has not banned games that award prizes of value, only gambling games.

Well, in some geographic locations we may add the ability to compete in tournaments where you pay a fee. Most of the fees collected would then go to the winner. In order to geo-block this feature from regions of the world where it is not allowed (like 13 states within the US), we need location. If we decide to not implement these tournaments, we will remove the permission.

That''s used by one of our libraries to determine the uniqueness of a device. I think we will be removing that soon too.
@_date: 2014-12-24 00:27:27
We plan to have an additional 10-15 games next year. Hopefully this will make things even more interesting.
@_date: 2014-12-24 14:14:14
This should be added in a release in January (control of which types of notifications you want/don't want).
@_date: 2014-12-24 00:18:09
Send an email to support and our bus-dev guys will be in touch.
@_date: 2014-12-24 00:25:07
We are going to be offering more tournaments with higher payouts as we get into next year. Just getting started!
@_date: 2014-12-24 14:13:23
We are kind of in a quiet beta period where we are testing things out. We have had more than 2 million games played on our systems, so we are getting comfortable that we are ready to push out more content (games).
@_date: 2014-12-23 18:03:41
That is a good idea. However, we have to be careful about Google's rule about not allowing gambling apps in the Play store. However, our business folks are thinking about a series of ways to enable us to increase the size of the tournament pools.
@_date: 2014-12-24 04:45:26
You are right, our games are games of skill. However, as of this moment, Google officially bans wagering on games of skill even though it is legal almost everywhere.
@_date: 2014-12-24 00:47:53
I will push hard to remove the location stuff, I agree with you and you have given me more ammunition to use in my argument.
@_date: 2014-12-23 20:22:00
I will mention that to the dev's. I know there has been discussion here about that.
@_date: 2014-12-25 00:40:55
Just sent a PN back. Thanks for your help !! Happy Holidays!

I think this is a fair statement to make about Google's policy. Google is saying any game that **facilitates gambling** is not allowed, **including but no limited to** online casinos, sports betting and lotteries, or games of skill that offer prizes of cash or other value. I don't believe they are saying all online casinos, sports betting and lotteries, or games of skill that offer prizes of cash or other value are not allowed. They are not allowed only if they facilitate gambling. Gambling requires that the player stands a chance to lose something of value. All of our games are FREE to play, not requiring any payment in any currency so the player never stands to lose anything of value. I don't believe there is any way to interpret our games as facilitating gambling.

I did a bit of the coding on the Flappy Bird clone. I love andengine. Good clean architecture that makes great use of OpenGL. I have actually written Open GL 3D frameworks in the past, and my hat is off to you. Nice work!
@_date: 2014-12-24 00:38:17
We are currently looking at how to generate revenues that can increase the tournament payouts. We probably won't go in the direction of standard banner ads, but more towards sponsors of tournaments. I know we are hiring sales people right now, so this is likely in Q1 of next year. Again, thanks for your work on andengine!
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:59:56
We are thinking about a premium version, or a monthly subscription that would give you the ability to win more. We have to be careful to stay within the boundaries of Google's rules (they don't allow gambling apps).
@_date: 2014-12-23 16:22:51
I would love to get people's thoughts on a network of casual mobile games where you compete to win real bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-23 20:21:20
You are probably right for the most part, but a lawyer could argue that you have to have a free way for someone to participate. In any case, Google is unbelievably picky and once they ban your app, they don't provide much recourse to plead your case.
@_date: 2014-12-24 00:26:34
If you could, would you mind contacting support The game should not be slow or get stuck, our tech guys would love to figure out what is going on. As for prizes, we wil be increasing them next year, but we are just getting going now. Wagering against other players is a possibility, but we are trying to make sure we stay within Google's guidelines.
@_date: 2014-12-24 00:40:07
That's a good point. I will feed it over to marketing folks. I don't like the big long decimal value either.
@_date: 2014-12-24 00:47:10
We have thought about this, and even tested it, but feel that it would be too costly for us to get the kind of distribution numbers we can get through the Play store.
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:12:56
There are no paid tournaments. For now, all tournaments are free to enter. Stay tuned as more games and tournament types are released throughout 2015.
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:15:26
I cannot figure out how to really get any bitcoin out of SaruTobi. Can someone let me know how to?
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:12:08
Completely untrue. Business model TBA, they are a well funded company with business models to be revealed in 2015.
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:17:22
There is a minimum cashout because of Bitcoin transaction fees. Also, there are no fee tournaments, but more choices are coming soon.
How much does SaruTobi pay out?
Also, what do you mean "less glamourous?"
