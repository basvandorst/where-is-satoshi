I have already expressed my sincere gratitude to patric but the bitcoin community as a whole is such a great group of people . as patric has said I have never asked for help I don't expect anyone to donate im just taken back by the kindness and the fact that people care and are willing to do this for me . I don't know what else to say someone has done a amazing act of indness for me and all I can say is thankyou and thankyou to anyone who has or will donate or is even just reading this . thanks for caring about a normal aussie guy who up until now had never experienced any random acts of kindness like this. thankyou guys
