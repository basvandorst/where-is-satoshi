I'm not allowed to say by request of the bank as it is a program in its alpha stage. They invited myself and others who have used Coinbase with our bank accounts to test the system and gauge interest. I believe they should be going public with it in the next few months. Suffice to say it is a rather large bank.

My bank has actually started working with Coinbase. I can monitor my Coinbase accounts from my bank's website. It shows up right alongside my checking and savings. I have no secret motives with Bitcoin and appreciate how much this legitimizes Bitcoin as a currency.

I don't speak up on reddit. Anything I say can and will get a down vote.

I came to the comments to post exactly this. Thank you.

I purchased a house last year with the same situation. Fortunately, my bank just treated the deposit from Coinbase as any other transaction. They only cared that it wasn't a loan.

Is there no way to see the IP address or location of the wanna cry bitcoin address?

The optimist in me bought last night at $2600. Right now I'm hating the optimist in me.

Hold that train for another couple weeks when I can start buying again.

Exactly. It'll bounce back higher in a few hours. I'm in it for the long game anyways.

Haven't signed up for changetip yet so I suppose this is a good chance.

 That first bubble is what got me hooked to this game. I made enough for a down payment on a house.

 Next stop, moon?
