TBH, the only reason I don't want btc to go up is that I don't want all my alts to be in the red :(

Umm.... but doesn't the network gain value from having more users? So following the herd is good because where the herd is is where the money is.
I'm just following metcalfe's law on this one because I think of crypto as a network.

Just as other Redditors have pointed out, some people I've talked to don't know that you can buy less than 1 unit of bitcoin. :/ 
I'm going to pull some profits and just gamble the rest. Who knows when it'll crash but when it does, cheap coins for us.

I PM'ed you. Pls reply.

Why is no one discussing this on r btc? 
I used to think that it was this sub that's censored but the longer I've been looking into both (for news), this sub feels way WAY more organic and real. It feels like 50% of the users there are all bots or something, either that or they're REALLY positive people like really positive.

System? 
How is it the system's fault? Would you pay someone who didn't know how to do a job more than someone who did? Is it your fault that someone's ancestor didn't do something? Power, of all forms, snowballs. So what? That's how it's always been for all animals.

Well... you need to account for the different currencies ya know?

What breed btw? Also, how will you cook it?

I'm sure you're right. I was just stating that I know that the other guy is right in terms of accounting purposes. I'm not familiar with how the law deals with or makes the above official. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:40:14
Balance sheet wise the other guy is correct.

Please stop with your 8th grade privilege.... keep it at 7th grade so I can understand plz

I don't think he's saying that all the btc rises are due to USDT being created but that every time USDT is created, BTC rises. I also saw an article that showed how the timing of USDT creation and reversals in downward btc prices were timed in to come together.
I also dont think that the argument of correlation without causation is apt here..

I understand your opinion, I think we just learned different lessons from traumatic experiences. Cheers, hope you make money from whatever you’re in!

I almost died 3 years ago and, in my experience, I didn't even think about any of the things you listed in your 3rd paragraph. Maybe I did after the fact (when I was ok and absolutely out of danger) but what I can tell you is that I wanted to not die and I wanted to keep my hand (if I survived). Both of these things cost money to keep and my mindset now is that the power to keep these things is one of, if not one of the most important things to me now. 
You cannot experience the best moments of life you talk about if you cannot safeguard your own life and money, a form of power, allows you to safeguard it.

I really appreciated your comment on Monero. I'm interested in it now. Thanks for taking the time to type that out.

Hormones exist though, our brains may be the juice signalling inputs is different. Men on ave. are more aggressive. Conditioning and expectation may have something to do with it but to say that it's simply that (conditioning and expectation) is discounting human evolution and the power our bodies hold.

What if it's sideways though?

Don't you have access to, arguably unlimited, fiat without actually having to carry it with a credit card?

How is crypto safer than stocks or bonds? We are using the typical financial definition of safe as in low volatility in differing market conditions. I don't really see an argument for cryptos being safer.
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:20:21
Why don't you think about it this way. Suppose I'm a rich dude that has assets in stocks and bonds, both of which are way safer than crypto, and I decide to purchase some crypto. Now, the market is tanking and my "safe" investments are losing, what should I do? Put my money in even riskier assets?

You trade bitcoin, so you price it....

Ya pricing may or may not differ from valuing depending on who you ask but if you take Buffet’s perspective as an investor, there’s a clear difference that has to do with what’s being exchanged.

But what if all 5 places burn down simultaneously? What will you do then huh? At least 5^2 trezors are required.

The world probably won't go to shit that fast. I think it'll be slow and gradual.... Mad Max style. Slowly and surely, we'll lose funding and people will start quitting til shit hits the fan.
