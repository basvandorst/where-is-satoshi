Banks will always be around because there will always be a demand for loans. Bitcoin will not replace banks, but it will disrupt them.

Truth! There is a good amount of merchants accepting Bitcoin payments today.

Bankers are bankers- they'll do whatever makes them money. In the beginning, it seemed like they were threatened by blockchain and crypto, but then decided that if you can't beat them, then join them.
For example,  Jamie Dimon was bashing crypto as JP Morgan was quietly developing its own blockchain technology.

Yes but banks are there for big loans for businesses, mortgages, etc.

We're on the same page as you here, in that they'll do anything to make money. Our "bankers are bankers" was the nicest way we could think to put it, and then we gave the Jamie Dimon example. We're just trying to give facts rather than our opinion.

Banks created a lot of bad press about crypto a few years ago. But now many are changing their tune and creating their own blockchain solutions.

His daughter bought Bitcoin years ago, and he publicly mocked her for it. As far as we know, she didn't call him out on anything (not publicly, at least).

I guess you didn’t buy in early enough lol

The way he continually bashed crypto made us suspect that he was quietly working on something, which he was.

Jamie Dimon did not go to prison.

Education is everything! These traditional bankers were very threatened by blockchain and cryptocurrency, but they're now seeing the value of the technologies and realizing that if they can't beat them, they should join them.

Haha, we'll never give investment advice, but we're all about the mass adoption of crypto payments.

We don't care how people choose to spend their money. We're just happy to see crypto adoption happening, and that was the point of our post!

How people choose to spend their money is up to them. We're just glad to report that crypto adoption is happening!
