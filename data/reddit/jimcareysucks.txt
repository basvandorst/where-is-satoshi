Reddit can be a cruel bitch... And it's also full of kind helpful souls like you.  Bravo sir.

1. I don't consent to any search or seizure of my property.
2. Am I being detained?
3.  Am I free to go?

The only support I ever got from CB was here on Reddit.  No response ever via their ticketing system

I think that the DMV may have switched our custom plates up on accident.  I just got "ASSMAN" in the mail a few days ago.

I'm of this same sentiment.  Taking all statements in this case as fact, its why our community gets a bad name.  We're a bunch of nerds trying to make this system work, if grandma can't trust that her money won't disappear from what ever device she was told to use, what's the point?  I don't want this to stay in the realm of technophiles, but as long as this keeps happening on a regular basis, that's where it will be relegated to exist.

Had Facebookers ignorant to BTC just post "Well, there goes BitCoin I guess!". SMH.  We need to increase education and shake this "criminal money" moniker we have for success.

I don't wholly disagree with you. But... Carrying cash around is a whole hell of a lot different than using technology to be your own bank.  While my cash might be vulnerable to theft while in my possession, at least I know with reasonable certainty how to protect it.
I certainly don't expect to put it in my bedroom safe at night, then open that safe in the morning to find its basically disappeared without anything alerting me to anything amiss.
I'm a fan of bitcoin.  I just don't think it's ready for a large segment of the population.  These kinds of stories don't help us.

I have for offering the sum of 5000000 bitcoins stuck in customs. In order for you to be granted this full amount, you must send me 100btc for the processing fees and customs tax.  This business is doing nothing but hurting the image of btc. Go away.

Coinbase.  Its easy and you can buy/sell very small amounts.

Step 1: Buy DeLorean
Step 2: Invent Flux Capacitor
Step 3: Piss off some Libyans
Step 4: Travel to future and record past bitcoin performance.
Step 5: Post on Reddit 
That's the only way anyone will get excited at these prediction posts.
We'll all be seriously impressed with the soothsaying that goes on in this sub when someone can...well, probably never

Nope.  I've done myself a HUGE favor by not watching the price anymore.  I used to be obsessed.  Other than the small wallet I use to buy stuff, I just forget about the rest being held.  Step away from the price charts man!

Looks like a few really helpful people in here.  Unfortunately for me though, my support ticket has been open with zero response for the last two weeks.  I don't know what I'm supposed to do other than file a BBB complaint and/or file an ACH debit dispute with my bank.  I want to like Coinbase, but when they won't respond to requests for help, and STILL continue to withdraw from my bank account it can get pretty frustrating.

I've had the Gyft ap on an Android and iOS for a while.  What a piece of shit.  It didn't work well for me, I thought the interface was terrible and the number of spam emails I got from them was insane.  No fucking thank you.
Edit:  I can see how it makes converting to gift cards easy, I just hate the app and all of the useless offers they push.

@_date: 2013-12-07 04:49:35
Its sort of the opposite for me.  All of the failed attempts via the app show as processed or pending on the website.  None of those transactions currently show on my app.  Very screwy.

I used to read this sub every so often.... Now I'm worried that I'll somehow burn it into my fucking screen!  Seriously though, I'm grateful that this resource is here for the community. It's given me more insight than any other possible source on bitcoin.  Thanks random strangers!
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:01:22
Seriously, ^ THIS.  The next crash/correction/apocalypse/bitcoin zombie alien invasion will get your heart pounding and you'll hear a screaming deep inside of you..."SELL...SELL STUPID! NOW! BEFORE YOU LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY!!!!!".
Ignore that panicky bastard, turn off your computer and go outside.  Don't sell for less than you paid.  Don't try and time the market. Just buy, HOLD, and/or actually spend your btc and enjoy the roller coaster posts &amp; sheer panic that you will see here.

Number 2 most exciting startup.
Number 1 at NOT RESPONDING TO SUPPORT TICKETS
Edit:  I love using Coinbase like the rest of you.  It's endlessly frustrating that they won't/can't reply to my support ticket involving them taking out ACH debits that previously report as "failed" buys via their Android app.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:43:15
I have sort of the opposite complaint with them today.  All afternoon I've been trying to buy $20-30 on the way down via the android app on my phone.  Each and every time I tried a buy, the app would say it was unable to complete.  Finally when I got home from work, I was able to log in from the web and purchase $23 worth (I know, high roller.). After I get my confirmation email for this successful purchase, I decide to log in and check my balance.  
What do I see? SEVEN BTC buys either COMPLETE or PENDING on my account today.  There should have been only my auto buy this morning and the confirmed by when I got home.  I even only got two confirmation emails in my inbox.
An extra $100 isn't going to break me, but it's not what I wanted.
I know this isn't Coinbase support, but damnit this level of service sucks. Sent them an email via their web form.
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:31:59
I can't wait to hear an actual explanation from your bank.  Bookmarking this to check tomorrow.  Other than grandiose thoughts of disrupting the traditional banking market, I can't for the life of me understand why a letter like this would be sent out.  Who cares what you do with YOUR money!?!?  You're not doing anything illegal.  PLEASE post tomorrow after your bank visit.

Gave one to my brother in law because he had asked several times about bitcoin.  He was hung up on the idea that he had to buy a whole coin.  So in addition to some other presents,  I gave him a paper wallet with .00761. He was so happy and excited that now he owns some.  It was a great experience.
