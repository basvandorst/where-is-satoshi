Interesting to see that the site's run by Norganna, who makes the excellent addons Auctioneer and Gatherer for World of Warcraft.

While I appreciate the sentiment, giving Gold to a Reddit admin makes even less sense than giving it to Bill Gates.

Fireballing. I said it. Good game, autocorrect.

Filling a counterpoint with hyperbole doesn't make me jump to reconsider my opinion, though it apparently resonates well in this particular echo chamger.

From the comments in the link:






Good lord, what do I have to do to separate myself from this line of thinking? I don't want to get painted with this brush, I drive public roads to get to work (as I'm sure this guy does), I'm kept safe by a police force, fire department, and military. If you don't want to pay taxes, don't make any money. Quit your job, tear up your social security card and go live on the fucking streets (which are kept notably hoborape-free due to a taxpayer-funded police force that frowns on that sort of thing.)

That's only the amount received at that address with Bitcoin. Their primary funding method is MoneyPak and I can tell you that number's way higher than $4,000.

Fireballing probably could be done effectively for one particular iteration of the virus. Tracking the outbound connections on a VM with a sample of the virus should give IPs. Then the VM could be restored from snapshot and try again with some firewall rules up. I may try this myself in the home lab.

Thanks for the question. The issue you describe hasn't come up yet to my knowledge so I'm not sure. The list of encrypted files is stored in the registry. I tossed around a couple of scenarios in my head but they all equate to "try paying the first ransom with the older PC disconnected. If they're still encrypted pay the old ransom".
You'd be extraordinarily unlucky to have both hit in the same 72 hour window, though.

Holy shit. $6.2 million?

See, there's nothing in the [documentation]( that backs that up though. As far as I can tell the 8 decimal places is a hard limit of the architecture. Not to say it couldn't be changed, but that's a potential sticking point if there is disagreement on how far they can be divided.

Hi. I wrote a rather thorough breakdown of the virus on If you're tech inclined, there is a viable patch using group policy, either in a domain environment or local policy if in a workgroup.
I will answer any questions that I can that are replies to this post. I have some familiarity with bitcoin, have mined for a few satoshis but I'm not an expert on that side of it by any means.

I probably should've said "killed for the time being." I know it's easy to say "the dollar is also determined by market forces" but there's a whole branch of government devoted to minimizing the variation, and I'd say they do a pretty good job of it.
I think it probably will stabilize out in the future, but I'm not sure how far out it will be before the correction hits. Right now, I would imagine a lot of people are holding onto their BTC because the value keeps climbing, likely because it's garnered a lot of media attention lately. The sell-off will either come or it won't, and the result will be either a massive downward correction or a totally stagnant economy.

Problem with that is that the backend, the authorizing of the decryption, is done by hand. It might work once at best.

This had some really interesting reading, and does echo my question, that it is a concern and that it is unique to Bitcoin. The 8 decimal places gives it a possible pool of currency orders of magnitude above the US Dollar supply, but as the link points out, once a wallet is lost, the currency never returns to the pool. It's an interesting conundrum, and it's never been seen before.
@_date: 2013-10-10 21:00:43
Yup, definitely some tricky variables. Probably won't know the way to do it until it happens to some poor bastard.

Plenty of people have had this hit on a Friday, have a whole weekend to encrypt, and in the intervening time an entire server's contents have been permanently encrypted.
EDIT: Also, in our first experience with the virus (day 0), the customers thought something was wrong but nobody knew what it was. The troubleshooting they *did* attempt was on totally unrelated matters. You'd need to know in advance what was going on to mitigate the bulk of the damage.
A RAM dump as far as I can tell is a wasted effort as the private key is never stored or even transmitted over the network to the virus client. Also, the encryption salt is different for each individual file. "Needle in a haystack" would be appropriate for the amount of data from RAM dumps you'd have to sift through to find commonality.

Cool story. I worry more about breaking and entering than solar fuck beams. Also ~~it's complacent~~ I'm sorry.
@_date: 2013-02-03 19:28:47
I was not aware of this. The "difficulty" of mining increases to scale with the rate the calculations are done, then?

You can't take one thing you don't like as being financed with taxes and write off the entire system of taxation. It's idiotic. How did you learn English? Probably in a school? How did you get there? On a taxpayer-funded bus or driving on taxpayer-funded streets? If you had a fire in your home, would you let it burn to the ground knowing that the alternative was to call a taxpayer-funded fire department driving taxpayer-funded firetrucks? Would you rather go back to (starting and then) extinguishing fires for profit?
Maybe you live in a rural area like I once did, where the only reason you've got a fucking phone, much less Internet service, is because of taxpayer money. 
This is something where working in an absolute never has and never will work.
