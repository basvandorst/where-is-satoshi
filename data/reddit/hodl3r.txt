Everyone wants fast transaction for sure but maybe bitcoin isnt for you and perhaps you might consider using bitcoin cash instead. Core devs did it. Bitcoin wont scale and massive transaction delays.

Today ? LOL. I've had 2 double spents in 2 weeks and also last year their server got compromised and the site was offline like 6-7 hours. After that I moved all my coins out. I was holding my breath that day :

Look Man, everything is a scam. Even original Bitcoin. Welcome to Matrix.

Just dont use them. I had 4.6 BTC stuck in my blockchain.info wallet for 3 days. Couldnt sleep at night properly. There is smth going on with this company and I no longer trust my coins with them. They didnt even replied to my emails so they dont give 0 f-s about their customers funds. This will eventually come back to your wallet after the transaction gets rejected by node or smth.

Also watch out for crypt0 on youtube. To me seems like a paid Ethereum hyper and all the altcoins = scam.
