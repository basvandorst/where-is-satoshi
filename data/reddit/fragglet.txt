There is no such thing as an ASIC-infecting virus. Go and read up on what an ASIC is.

Stolen keys doesn't make sense. Suppose you stole the keys for the accounts being mentioned here. The first thing you'd do is transfer all funds to another account: otherwise, if Gox had a backup copy of the keys somewhere then they could transfer them to a new, safe account.

I bet you could manipulate the price quite a bit with that many coins to throw around. Anyone care to plot the transactions from that account against the price of BTC over the past year?

No. It's not an address.
The layman's understanding of how Bitcoin transactions work is that "you post a transaction to send from address X to address Y". But that isn't really how it works - or rather, it's a simplification of what's really going on.
Here's a better way to understand it: Bitcoin transactions are puzzles, with rewards attached. If I send you 10BTC, I post a puzzle that only your private key can solve, with 10BTC as the reward. If you want to "send" that elsewhere, you solve my puzzle and create a new one.
So normal transactions just require one signature. n-of-m transactions are transactions that require signatures from multiple keys in order to solve. So you set up things like contracts or escrow services that make use of this. In fact, Bitcoin includes an entire virtual machine and bytecode format, so you can write your own "puzzles" as small programs to solve.

Fair enough, I wasn't aware you could specify multisig "addresses". Thanks!
Additional question as it sounds like you might be able to answer it: I understand that currently you can only issue transactions that follow certain standard structures. While this makes sense from a security perspective is there any plan to relax these restrictions in the future if and when the code has been satisfactorily audited?

Probably best if you don't editoralize your headlines.

Dogecoins keys are based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA, same as Bitcoin), not SHA256. You might be thinking of the fact that Bitcoin/Dogecoin addresses are typically SHA256 hashed, but that's only really a minor detail; the security of the network doesn't depend on it.

Then it sounds like you're talking at crossed purposes to the OP. To reiterate, the OP said:


If someone found such a flaw, they could potentially use it to circumvent the proof of work that miners need to perform to mine blocks; this proof of work ensures the security of the network. So the OP is correct that Bitcoin (and all other currencies using SHA256 as a hash function) would be affected, but others (such as Litecoin/Dogecoin that use scrypt) would not.
What you said was:


Aside from the fact this is incorrect as I stated above (the keys are ECDSA) you're describing a different form of attack. The attack you describe is a legitimate one: if someone found a weakness in ECDSA, they could then use that to crack peoples' private keys and steal their funds, undermining the security of the network, albeit in a different way.
Public keys are SHA256 hashed to generate an address, and this would actually provide some limited defence against this kind of attack. But really it's ECDSA that's the important part, not SHA256.
So when you say:


you're wrong. The OP wasn't; you've misunderstood the point he/she was making.

And what about the name change?

One possibility is that Gox does still has a significant number of Bitcoins under its control and is going to sell these off to raise money to pay its creditors.

@_date: 2014-04-11 06:08:08
No. That's what I said: the private keys are not SHA256; they're ECDSA (elliptic curve).

If you own currency then inflation is bad and deflation is good. The problem comes when and if you decide to build an entire economy around that currency. Economies prosper when it is possible to borrow money easily and when money circulates more freely.
In a deflationary economy there's a disincentive to exchange money because the money might be worth more in the future: the balance is stacked in favor of hoarding money instead. In the context of Bitcoin, an alternative is [Freicoin]( which has demurrage, where currency slowly evaporates over time, giving holders an incentive to spend it rather than hoard it.

Looks like a hugely overcomplicated and overengineered solution for what is essentially a pretty simple goal (private keys should be stored in a secure element). You could achieve the same thing just by putting it on a standard smart card - as a proof of concept, [here's]( a Masters thesis by someone who implemented ECDSA in software on a Javacard smart card.
A smartcard platform like the [Yubikey Neo]( gives you Javacard in a convenient form-factor that also supports NFC, so you could make it talk to your phone if you wanted. In fact, modern smartphones contain a secure element for payment credentials (that's why Google Wallet only works on certain phones), so in theory you could just use that and ditch the whole separate device entirely.
