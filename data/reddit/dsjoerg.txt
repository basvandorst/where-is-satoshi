Give a Man a Fish, and if he deems it best he can sell the fish and enter a fishing class.  Or sell the fish and take a programming class.  Or eat the fish so that he doesn't die.

Thinking of BTC as a bet, and thinking as a gambler, you can use the Kelly Criterion framework to make your choice: 
If you can assign probabilities to BTC doubling and to BTC halving, then you can use the Kelly Criterion framework to tell you what % of your savings to bet on it.
But really the right answer must take into account more of your financial situation and prospects.  If BTC were unavailable for some reason, what would you do with the money?  Is it possible that you will have big surprise expenses?  Do you have any debt?
It also might help to think of your "bankroll" (or net worth) as not only your savings but also your earning potential.
Anyway, bottom line, I think it's a horrible thing to do with your savings because it's pure gambling on how quickly people wake up to the power of BTC.  When you need to turn your savings back into fiat currency, BTC might be in a lull and you'll be mad.  You _will_ need the money at some point in the future, why gamble?
