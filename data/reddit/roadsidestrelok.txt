Let's go further. There was bitmarket.eu, an exchange which had voluntary fees. Since most people didn't want to pay anything, one of the founders tried to earn some money by... gambling with user's bitcoins on Bitcoinica (without their knowledge or permission, obviously), which again stored hacked/lost money in three separate instances (and a lot of the funds were on MtGox).

While sending the money, did you chose SHA, BEN, or OUR? If the recipient ends up paying a lot in fees it still might not always be worth it.
I think a lot also depends on the bank you're sending to and from, and the intermediary banks. I know 2 other people that sent money to Serbia from Poland and they all ended up paying different fees than I did. My bank couldn't even tell me how much I would end up paying if I made a SHA or OUR payment.

There is no *guarantee* that someone else would steal it. Depending on how much resources is throwing at stealing from brainwallets, there might not be too many individuals still bothering with it. After all, brainwallets are not as popular as they used to be, in part because more people are aware that it's not so easy to pick fairly random but easy to remember phrases, and most brainwallets with easy phrases have long since been hacked (some of them probably by , some by the creator of brainwallet.org who once came on IRC asking for advice on how to speed up searching for brainwallets, and most by people who wouldn't want to risk admitting they had anything to do with it).

If you ever heard coinbase was a scam, it's probably because their anti-fraud "system" has a "strange" habit of refusing customers' BTC purchases and sending them their money back if the price suddenly increases.
Other than that, they're legit*, hopefully you won't fall prey to their anti-fraud "system".
*obviously you should be connecting with them from a safe device that's not malware-infested, and you should store most of your BTC on paper wallets and/or offline computers that never touch internet and/or various USB sticks. (you should have multiple encrypted backups)

Yes, use BTC as a medium of exchange, let Bitpay and your users who will pay in BTC use it as a currency. 
It's not actually that simple with "let people get cash for their BTC on exchanges and use that at our stores" because:
a) not everyone has an account on an exchange
b) or wants to set up one and submit ID, docs, stool samples, etc.
c) it can easily take many days to get the money sent to a bank account after selling BTC
d) BTC holders want to use their BTC without the hurdle of exchanging it to fiat currencies
Except *maybe* some companies in the finance sector, or those wanting to speculate on BTC, I wouldn't recommend using BTC as a currency because it is simply too volatile, and it's a very big company, they may also encounter liquidity issues on exchanges.
So for the above mentioned reasons (a) through (d), please consider at least for now only accepting BTC as a medium of exchange. Getting mentioned in the news as "accepting Bitcoin" might generate you some nice sales depending on what your company can offer.
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:12:43
reddit has some inane rules 
@_date: 2014-03-24 21:30:57


The less regulation the better. If there is to be *any* regulation at all then it *must* be well-suited to this new technology and drafted only by those well acquainted with it. A reasonable example of "well-suited" is proof-of-reserves (aka proof of solvency), which some exchanges are slowly implementing, it's based on crypto and provides a way to show the users that the exchange is not running fraction reserve. [Example](
Another example of what I would consider "intelligent" is the concept of "provably fair" employed by many bitcoin-based gambling websites, which because it's based on crypto (as long as it's properly implemented) is a much better guarantee of safety than conventional gambling regulations and licensing. 
tl;dr: When dealing with cryptography (Bitcoin) you should also use involve/make use of cryptography in the (new) regulations.
In the case of handling fiat there are plenty of inane rules that would be hard to impossible to avoid, so at least we should try to give *some* (I know it won't be impossible for absolute, so only "some") more freedom for bitcoin businesses that also want to deal with fiat (miners selling btc, exchanges, etc.), so that all those entrepreneurs won't be running away to other countries (like many are doing now, most bitcoin exchanges are not US-based, despite the fact that Americans are probably the single country with the highest amount of Bitcoin users).


Bitcoin 0.9 released, Flexcoin (bitcoin "bank") lost $600k, Vircurex exchange had to freeze withdrawals because they have been running fractional reserve after losing about 1200 BTC last year. You probably heard about Gox finding out they have a wallet with 200k BTC. Someone's ordering 400 Bitcoin ATMs for Dubai; someone else ordered 100 Bitcoin ATMs for Spain.


I think those could be interesting for others to read:
- [bitcoin contracts](
- proof of existence, blockchain-based notaries
- OP_RETURN, storing data in the blockchain
- m-of-n multisignature transactions

I disagree; price volatility is a bigger issue. One of the reasons why merchants are adopting Bitcoin is the *lack* of reversible transactions (not counting 0-conf for simplicity's sake). Without merchants accepting BTC, there's less incentive to buy BTC. Why buy it if you can't spend it?

That's the theory, in practice they don't work and serve different purposes.
"In conclusion, as I cited in my 2001 Congressional testimony on what became the USA PATRIOT Act, money launderers do not have a statistically significant chance of being caught so the deterrent effect of our AML approach is negligible. Only a minuscule fraction one percent of CTRs and SARs result in criminal convictions. I know of no examples where AML reports prevented any terrorist events.  
Our AMLs are a failure: the drug trade continues unabated, financial fraud is more prevalent now than ever, and terrorist groups continue to finance their operations. The greatest tragedy is what everyone knows and policymakers don’t seem to care: it is the unbanked, the poor, and the racially and ethnic minorities in rich countries (and the populations of poorer countries) that suffer these costs for such elusive benefits."
"We find that the current system is pervasive and highly intrusive but without any evidence as to tangible effect".
Meanwhile, it only serves to stifle competition because only the bigger players can afford to be compliant with the AML/CTF/etc. laws.

That's assuming he has a US bank account. Otherwise he has a choice between getting an Amazon gift card or having a check mailed, and in many countries it may be difficult, expensive and take quite a while. It can take my bank up to 3 months to cash a check because no has been using them since the 90s here. And not all banks are going to accept them in the first place.
But yeah, 205 BTC over 2 months is a lot, so it's possible that he's helping other people cash out.

Not denying their involvement, but it was very likely a lot less than "hundreds of millions of stolen Bitcoin".

Current government is hell-bent on finding enough money to finance promised welfare payments, and retain their electorate until the next election. They're mostly after VAT fraud, but it seems that Bitcoin exchanges and other services holding/processing cryptocurrencies might be forced to report information about the coins' owners to the government.

It was all over the mainstream/semi-mainstream media starting with Slashdot in July 2010 and Gawker in June 2011.
Most people who first hear of Bitcoin/crypto dismiss it, or barely put any money into it (not an unwise move with risky investments), or sell out early. I also heard of Bitcoin in May 2011 but I dismissed it as a scam at first and didn't start mining until June 1st. I also sold a non-insignificant amount of the coins I mined to cover hardware/electricity expenses throughout 2011-2012 and that was the case with most people who mined. Very few people decide to HODL all/most of their coins for &gt;6 years.

@_date: 2013-12-14 21:22:26
There's more, and more of similar stuff can be found here:
A lot of people or "companies" that were hacked or "hacked" (or outright stole coins, like Nefario who still owes ~1000 BTC if not more) were at some point very trusted members of the Bitcoin community.
I'm not saying Bobby Lee is a scammer or that he will scam at some point in the future, but just saying I wouldn't be surprised if it happened. 
Always be a little paranoid and you won't lose your coins to a scammer.

Great news for notorious bitcoin scammers like Nefario or Zhou Tong.

Move to a developing country and $13K/yr is enough to live on comfortably.

I wonder if Mike Gogulski had anything got to do with that.

wow, I got really scared that the data was destroyed, fortunately that seems it was not the case

Time will show. Probably the difficulty will stabilize in the next few months, unless ASIC miner prices fall drastically or the ASIC producing companies will find a way to produce more efficient/cheaper/faster machines.

Anyone know the shipping costs (to EU)?

Yay, buy high, sell low!

In Burkinafaso too.

Considering that the hashrate doubles ever month, that would be insanely expensive and could even push mining hardware's price up.
@_date: 2013-11-05 22:45:52
That's a 2.5% fee. Similar to some Bitcoin mixers.

Use strong (&gt;=12 characters from at least 95-char ASCII set), fairly random passwords + set the number of PBKDF2 iterations from the default 10 to 5K to 20K.

They are doing it wrong:
1) Re-using addresses
2) Not adjusting prices automatically to exchange rates

It took me too long to get this "joke".
@_date: 2013-10-25 18:41:24
Will give it a try, thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:45:09
I almost fell for it.
@_date: 2013-11-17 10:37:04
so far nothing (otherwise I wouldn't be still using it from time to time and would start a separate topic myself here)
@_date: 2013-11-07 11:01:45
I'm pretty sure it's pegged to something less volatile, like USD, gold or silver.

Check who the IP belongs to/to whom is it allocated or who is in charge of it, if you're lucky and someone didn't cover their tracks well their is still some hope (especially if it's someone from the same country that you're living in).
If it belongs to a VPN or a proxy, your chances are much lower, but again if they weren't careful enough and the VPN/proxy service keeps logs (too many of them do...) there is still some chance.
If the IP belongs to a TOR exit node, your chance are near zero. Pretty much the only way to find out who it was (and again assuming they were careless enough as to rely on TOR only) is to contact the TOR exit node operator, some of them log/spy/sslstrip their users.

Yup, he wanted to buy one in Thailand first but didn't end up buying till now.
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:54:58
You are a scam
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:29:38
Buyer can claim he was "hacked" up to 180 days after the sale takes place.

I don't store much there and sometimes even analyze the JS they serve me.

I did see some complaints of this nature on bitcointalk but I can't tell whether people making them were credible or not.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:37:42
Or just tell people you have made some bad trading decisions and have a single digit amount of BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-03 16:04:52
A lot of people bought bitcoins for $5 or less (I have bought for as low as $2) but do you think all of them kept it all along the way? 
Nope, many bought or sold at $5-10-20-50-150-250-150-80-150-200 etc.
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:13:57
example: 
also, depending on where you live, many transactions in cash above a certain threshold (especially involving businesses) are required to be done using banks, where I live the threshold is 15 000 €.

Fully distributed and DOS-resistant Bitcoin-Qt implementation of CoinJoin with CoinSwap, or if you're looking for something more challenging — CoinWitness that wouldn't require a soft fork.

Log in to blockchain.info, go to Account Settings, then go to Debugging. 
I've personally got it set at 20K (max.)

I don't know if you have the funds to do so but you could try buying tents.

I use email more often than facebook (usually log in about once a month).

stuff I see missing, apart from those mentioned:
I2P (Bitcoin can run over I2P) and pywallet
