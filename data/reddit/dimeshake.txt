Read the book, skipped the speech...

It's fraud like any other kind of business transaction. Not currency regulation.

It can make a copy and add it to your path where it may indeed have write privileges.  Something like ~/bin, if you use that.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:41:21
It's just another way to say "I don't believe it"!

Localbitcoins is local.  There's likely someone near you. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 14:19:26
Thanks for the mirror - site appears to be falling over. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:27:43
I cannot understand why it's around anymore.
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:36:59
It's down there somewhere, let me have another look!
@_date: 2014-10-15 00:38:19
They do it to allow tracking via URL parameters. Something like
    visible                   displayed
      -&gt;  
@_date: 2014-10-15 05:31:41
That's absolutely inexcusable, agreed.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:53:57
A lot of people do that.

Cryptolocker.  That would be **hilarious**.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:58:43
I think this is very likely. He seems to be acting just like the gambler that thinks the next bet will pay off, and is stalling for time to make the attempt. 
@_date: 2012-11-26 17:23:10
Indeed.  Here are [similar planes]( for sale.
@_date: 2012-11-26 17:22:31
Similar vintages of that model are in the $1mil range and higher.  
@_date: 2012-07-13 14:19:25
Fucking amateurs.
@_date: 2012-01-10 03:07:07
Don't criticize what you don't understand.

It is - if you could pay the whole purchase price with it. But don't go looking for a giant loan based on money for a deposit without history, I guess. 
@_date: 2011-07-16 03:27:46
What's this written in?  Windows only? 
@_date: 2011-06-10 15:02:20
The cards that people are looking for right now are 58xx series.  If you have a line on those, you might have some business, though I don't think many are being manufactured anymore.  We can get 6850s for $270 from a US retailer at the moment.
@_date: 2011-07-12 20:39:10
It probably has to do with the recent posts by AtlasLGo regarding censorship of submissions/content to this subreddit.  Perhaps not all mods agreed on the free-for-all approach.  jakemates did the recent CSS skinning, so he was probably added for access to the CSS editing functions.
@_date: 2011-06-11 15:33:13
Yes, this is only necessary on Windows.
@_date: 2011-06-13 22:12:59
This is an excellent article indeed.  It does a very good job of breaking down the whole issue of currency, digital currency, and bitcoins approach to securing it.  Great piece.
@_date: 2011-06-27 19:07:12
I agree that it would certainly look better.  However, they may not want to run mail services from the machine that has the mtgox.com domain.  There are legitimate cases not to want that.
I'd argue they should be using mail.mtgox.com or similar.  In any case, if the sending machine is verifiable via MX records and/or SPF, you can classify it as legitimate for the origin domain.
Interestingly, mtgox.com is using Google Apps for mail.  They also do not have w001.mo.us.xta.net listed as an approved sender in SPF.  They certainly have some shit to get together as far as making this all kosher, but you still can't say that it's not a real mail server :)
@_date: 2011-06-14 17:44:30
On linux, you could use a symlink, or just mount the whole .bitcoin directory from an external device.
@_date: 2011-06-27 18:22:15
What the hell is a real mail server?
@_date: 2011-06-15 20:03:59
I'm curious as to what miner you were using?
@_date: 2011-06-10 17:21:52
I think that's a lot higher than people will be willing to pay.  I just bought a 6870 for $180 to supplement my 5850 that I got earlier this week for $220.  The 5850s have dried up, for the most part, so you might be able to get a little premium on those, but not $370.  One could get a better hashrate with two 6870s and save money.
@_date: 2011-06-11 15:31:48
I say we call them bitcoins, bitty bitcoins, itty bitty bitcoins, itty bitty bitty bitcoins, and on and on down to the 8th decimal.  Works for me.

I don't think you understand how SMTP works.
@_date: 2011-06-15 15:32:35
They store the account details with strong encryption, instead of the very weak obfuscation browsers use for their built-in storage.
@_date: 2011-06-15 17:04:30
If you enable master password for the pass manager, it uses 3DES, which is good. Without master password, your passwords are sitting ducks.

What's your current hash rate?  Forgive me if I'm dense, but I don't see it in your text.
@_date: 2011-06-11 16:06:48
Just hold onto it - it'll bounce :)
@_date: 2011-06-20 14:58:05
If you are suspicious, you can look at the headers of the message to see if it originated from where it claims to have been sent.

I don't know, but where do I get me some *spaculator* data?
@_date: 2011-06-08 15:12:03
It won't.  You can only really mine with GPUs these days.

Common for Mt Red.  I'm hoping this shapes up, I'd love to use it.
@_date: 2011-06-11 16:04:01
It's not, unless you have a mom and pop hookup locally that still has 'em in stock at a decent price.
@_date: 2011-06-15 20:39:24
Is it possible you picked up a trojan?  Do you copy your wallet.dat for backup anywhere online?  
@_date: 2011-06-20 20:11:39
I'd be complaining if I lost 10btc.
@_date: 2011-06-11 00:33:37
Now, if reddit put that little javascript snippet on their site, on the other hand....
@_date: 2011-06-14 18:36:28
Good to know.

He paid good money for that picture, he won't be sharing it willy-nilly with the likes of Zamarok.

Lucky bastard.

Yeah, this is real useful.

Make sure you are properly sandboxing things like flash player.  It does not use SOCKS proxy as configured in the browser, so you may well be leaking data all over.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:43:28
Yes, that's part of the overall hurdle to making it happen.  It's a pain in the ass all around, but it's probably better that people are paranoid from the start and find better ways to streamline it than make it too easy and miss some obvious security concern.  Crawling and walking...
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:19:38
Yes, how did your wallet.dat get compromised to begin with?
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:29:34
I'm a systems guy with a lot of experience with Varnish caching, happy to help when it comes time to looking at what (presumably public) assets can be handled well with that.  I'm well versed in general *nix performance tuning as well, but it sounds like you guys would likely have that covered.  Let me know if you'd like to connect.
@_date: 2013-07-03 23:31:30
I'm not sure how you'd do it on Windows. I would disable flash when you wish to browse via the socks proxy.

He's basically a drifter. Not his home.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:24:51
It's still insanely useful as a means of exchange, even if you can't value things in BTC directly day to day.  The only hurdle to this is being able to quickly exercise the exchange to other currency so that merchants can count on getting the value they require for whatever they're selling.  Getting BTC adopted as a payment method is still a good goal to have, even while volatile as it's still useful.
I'd love to see it stabilize so that people can get to know the value of a BTC, but perhaps a good first step to that stability is putting it in wider use.
