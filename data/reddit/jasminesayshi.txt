Welcome to capitalism. &lt;sarcasm&gt; Try Auroracoin for your Marxist ideas. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
@_date: 2014-11-27 23:37:32
Those are myths by people like you, not bitcoiners.
@_date: 2014-12-20 13:51:32
The best time to buy bitcoin is now. However, be aware that the price may drop more due to bitcoin being overhyped (right word?) in 2013-2014. I support bitcoin, but I don't think it can sustain these high prices for long, and may go down further.
@_date: 2014-11-11 12:43:50
Oh, apologies.
@_date: 2014-12-27 00:41:56
This is in the controversial category :P Basic reddiquette not to downvote for *disagreeing*.
@_date: 2014-11-11 01:52:18
I'm new to bitcoin and would like some funds.
I'm a scammer and give me some bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:37:42
I'm tired of this centralisation. -_- Let the downvotes begin.
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:42:42
Why are people downvoting a bot?
@_date: 2014-11-27 22:54:16
To everyone who says Peercoin is inflationary: HYPER. :/
@_date: 2014-12-30 01:15:15
I agree very much. Let's get back to centralisation. Have a donut @_date: 2014-12-30 01:16:14
Try .

Examples from active accounts in?

He is using his "freedom of speech" to lie about the legal status of bitcoin. That's not freedom of speech.
@_date: 2014-11-11 01:57:08
New reddit account, no verification that you created it, stop falling for these.
@_date: 2014-12-12 00:47:51
Disclaimer: bitcoin is designed to be used as a currency, not an investment. You can if you'd like, but you can lose, and there are better safer investments.
@_date: 2014-11-12 01:56:24
Welcome to . We use open source.
@_date: 2014-12-01 01:56:25
Bitcoin is an alternative to banking, not just an internet payment system. Bitcoin and western union have the same rates? Bullshit.
@_date: 2014-12-30 18:11:42
Alright, thank you :D 1 donut @_date: 2014-11-16 15:14:17
I submitted a draft page. It's very small, but I can't add much until it's approved because of Fair Use.
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:48:41
The main issue with Changetip I have of that it's centralised. They can take your BTC if they want to.
@_date: 2014-12-30 00:48:16
Fuck the foundation, fuck centralisation *flips off*
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:18:34
Thank you very much, this was my first tip and I'm very grateful ☺
@_date: 2014-11-11 02:14:11
Being Swiss, I don't have to deal with the things Americans do. We have no laws passed regarding Bitcoin. I know some people unfortunately say that that means we have no regulations, but we have same regulations as normal Francs.
@_date: 2014-11-13 12:09:47
Sorry if I was unclear, I meant that you are in control of the bitcoins of users.
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:54:40
They didn't ban bitcoin, they are simply saying stores can only use Ukrainian currency. You can still send and receive bitcoin, and buy things from friends.
@_date: 2014-11-13 01:42:49
What benefits does Coinbase have as a result of its centralisation?
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:18:29
I think it's beautiful, I'll look into this.
@_date: 2014-12-30 01:25:50
It's being used as an investment and asif it's the same as, say, a currency from a new government. Decentralisation will win out. Have a donut @_date: 2014-11-27 22:34:12
Another throwaway. A lot of bitcoin haters today, I'm going to assume they're the same person using different throwaway accounts.
@_date: 2014-12-20 13:48:26
They will. I remember reading another article on this subreddit about ChangeTip's new fee only earning very little from their fees. I'm confident they will sell user data, but the main reason I'm against ChangeTip is the centralisation that Bitcoin was created to stop. Let the downvotes pour in.
@_date: 2014-11-13 20:13:15
I'm talking about Android itself.
@_date: 2014-12-01 20:28:33
And, of course, the source is the website producing it, with no evidence whatsoever.
@_date: 2014-11-11 12:50:03
And... People are giving bits on this.
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:43:43
The second largest coin.
@_date: 2014-12-01 20:45:33
I agree. With Coinbase and Changetip just being the minimum, this centralisation needs to end.
@_date: 2014-12-24 03:47:24
Why are people down voting you?
@_date: 2014-11-18 20:33:35
No. No no no. No more centralisation.
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:44:36
This is amazing. Decentralisation is the reason I don't use ChangeTip. The market got an upgrade.
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:41:58
Absolutely brilliant explanation. Have a beer @_date: 2014-11-16 18:36:39
I live in Switzerland as well. I don't use circle, but this should be fixed.
@_date: 2014-11-12 01:59:08
Wikipedia user. I'd love to contribute to a ChangeTip page, I'll start working on that as soon as possible.
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:22:37
I remember that thread :/
@_date: 2014-11-12 02:01:18
Use Hive or Electrum if you want the same Bitcoin wallet on both. Electrum for security, Hive for convenience.
@_date: 2015-01-02 02:14:06
Good answer. Have a donut @_date: 2015-01-13 21:46:19
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:43:55
You can't cancel a transaction though...
@_date: 2014-12-20 13:26:18
What a suprise.
*waves Swiss flag*
@_date: 2015-01-20 03:44:40
Just a troll.
@_date: 2015-01-05 01:25:13
They said they were trusted on their forum and told be to check, I said I was unaware of trust profiles on this forum, and they told be to keep looking. I didn't want to seem unfamiliar so I just said "okay".
@_date: 2015-01-29 02:32:35
I use pwdhash for password management, you might be interested
@_date: 2015-03-14 14:59:19
This is why I'm against Coinbase as much as the people here will talk about how *great* of a centralised service it is. We talk about how Bitcoin is revolutionary because it is distributed and decentralised and go and put our money in this centralised service; we're just moving the problem.
Oh yeah, and let the downvotes begin.
@_date: 2015-03-09 19:48:41
You need to send him your wallet.DAT...

@_date: 2015-03-20 15:10:39
A *very* misleading title.
