There are lightning mobile wallets now. Top sticky June Recap on main bitcoin reddit has a link under "development"

Nice work! Spread the word friend

Yeah, what he said. This could very well be a set of private keys. If it is, it'd be good on you to return it. Maybe take a small finder's fee ;)

Bls sir??

Use a dummy wallet

Smart move brother

When people actually realize this is true, that will be the top of the next bull market.

makes sense, China cant get foreign money as easily through Hong Kong, so what better way to bring foreign money in than through pumping crypto.

I did this. Dont be greedy and try to claim something you cant prove. I claimed 0 cost basis, paid the assload of tax, and built a damn house.

Sounds like you got your ducks in a row! Shit I would sell a car for btc with no lawyer. Blockchain is the lawyer.

Good call Boss. Seriously. Way to see the future.

Mycelium wallet for Android still has the buy/sell platform which works really well, if underused in some areas.

Pretty confident we wont see under 7400.

I mean, you could choose to repay them or not. You'd have trouble buying any real assets without paying some capital gains, but it could be done. Or you could just pay back your debts. Or you could declare bankruptcy.
Exiting the system doesn't necessarily preclude paying back your loans. Exiting the system is giving yourself the freedom to choose, by going full retard btc.

I disagree. Pretty soon once we cross 20k anyone who does this will be very happy with their ballsy move
@_date: 2019-06-12 04:18:56
The sad thing is the majority will do it at the top of the bull market, because that's what dumb money does. Whether or not they have the fortitude to weather a bear market and wait for the next bull is another story.
@_date: 2019-06-11 08:45:14
When people realize they can max out their credit and buy btc as an exit from the system... oh wait give it 2 years
@_date: 2019-12-08 08:07:45
Actually a profound statement simply. Nice work
@_date: 2019-09-18 04:32:39
I completely agree, followed this reasoning and path, became a trader, ditched grad school, moved to Hawaii, built a bamboo house paid in btc, and am semi retired. 
I chucked my student loan excess at it when I was 27. Paid mine, my wife's, my sister's loans off.
Dont listen to the naysayers
 Bitcoin is the only option out of first slavery.
