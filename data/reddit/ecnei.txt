I was told max amount hard-coded in wallet is under 0.1 BTC? And that people are losing money? Lightning Labs CEO tweeted not to use it yet. I ask because I run an extrajurisdictional company that will take payments in crypto. If BTC LN was actually functional we would enable support even though we prefer Monero for privacy.
If someone trustworthy were to run a non-logging LN node we would connect to them. Privacy would be better than on-chain, at least...

Denial-Of-Service including censorship. Bitcoin will be an non-Censored settlement-layer for a Censored-Centralized payment platform?
This is an honest question. My company depends on crypto to operate as it is not legal in many countries. If we support LN but have a well-known address will not this mean major hubs can deny us payments?

There are many tens of thousands of transactions with $1+ fees - over half the mempool. How the hell is that spam? What is your exact criteria?

This line of reasoning makes anti-sense. 100,000 car just means 1000 LTC. How is that better than sending 10 BTC? Didn't u/nullc even state this?

Running a full node has no impact on the so-called 'attack' of miners agreeing on larger blocks. What matters is voting with your CPU (or GPU or ASIC): mine on top of a chain that follows the rules you want.

Discussion of alts is not allowed here, please don't do that.

So let me get this straight, the current team is a bunch of volunteers but if the network increases to 2MB blocks they will quit and never come back, not even hired, and no one will replace them? That sounds like a centralized system and I don't buy it. And damn it is only a 2x increase and been talked about for years.
All I know is the current Bitcoin system is a PITA for actual transfers and only inertia is keeping it so widespread. I'd like it to respond to that and be cheap and useful again.

Cryptonote has an anonymous creation team. But the most popular fork, Monero, has some community leaders.

If they continued working on core, 2X can just copy all the changes into 2X. 2X's only real needed change is an if height &gt; something then max_size *= 2.
I understand that there may be a few minor changes but on the whole it is just a blocksize issue.
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:52:28
Whatever man. I'm telling you how actual users perceive this. No other solutions are being offered. General people see the change being doubling a single number and such a change has been talked about for YEARS. I do not care about firing people so I do not know why you are saying that.
(And this whole thread is someone suggesting and half agreeing with a change to the POW...)

Will legacy chain do an emergency fork to change PoW once they lose most hashpower? Does that not make it no longer the legacy chain, strictly speaking?
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:29:02
I'm a neutral party just getting up to speed on this (we will depend on cryptocurrencies in our business). What development does 2X have to do? Would it not just be multiplying a number by 2 and keeping all other code the same?

Because there simply is not the same amount of traction. I paid someone yesterday with PayPal via Local Bitcoins. I can't do that with Bitcoin Cash or Monero. And where there are systems that take alts, they are so much tinier they do not always work for us. Bitcoin has huge traction and better keep it.

I thought miners supported Segwit2X? A one time increase would certainly help right now. SW transaction take up a tiny more space than normal tx so I do not see why that is acceptable but a blocksize increase is not. And there are not more transactions per block now that SW was turned on.
I am trying to keep an open mind. And I really do not care about the people involved or the shit flinging. But damn I read and I cannot see why we are still at 1MB when this has been discussed for years. Other platforms do hard fork upgrades all the time and do not run into issues. So I am having a hard time believing 2 years is the time required to implement a blocksize increase which is so much less complicated than segwit or anything else.
I will watch the video, thank you!
I do not mean to fight but damn it is annoying as someone making many transactions and having to deal with tx fee-time uncertainty.

I see this a lot lately. What does it even mean??? Mining is the only useful way to vote. It sucks it is so centralized but that's the system.
And no, people like me (call us supporters, whatever, all we want is the simple, obvious steps) are annoyed this is even a damn argument in 2017, going into 2018. A small size increase could have been done a long time ago and no one has shown why it has been so difficult. Segwit for instance is a thousand times more complicated yet was installed. I do not get it.

I would not care who the people proposing it is, so I am curious why you'd phrase it as B2X signatories. No more halvings and unlimited block size sound a bit extreme. No fees sounds more open to abuse or spam v small fees. But a long tail emission like Monero? Perhaps.
But folks that use the system do not see it this way at all. It is not a case of 2X means we end up with unlimited bitcoins and 100GB blocks. It looks like political bickering.

Pseudonyms are anonymous in the same way Satoshi Nakamoto is. (Those are not their real names, just bits of famous scientist names mangled around.)

I absolutely do not give a shit about Bitcoin politics. I run a business dependent on crypto (see comment history). I, and everyone I've spoken to, sees B2X as a transaction capacity doubling and nothing more. We had a transaction with a $1.5 fee take 4 hours to confirm the other day. This is annoying as fuck when all we want to do is use the system to transfer money. We do not care what the price is but just want it to stabilize so we can use it to transfer money. But when we had to tack on a $5 fee to send $50 to someone, that starts to look pretty dumb.
Anyone that thinks general users are somehow against a 2MB block increase probably do not talk to actual users that depend on this for day-to-day work.
This is good because if general people actually read the shitfest that this and btc subreddits are, or dug into the people on either side, holy fuck they would run. Basically everyone involved has some severe personality issue of some kind. I am only staying slightly on top of things because I am very exposed to crypto. My business means I cannot easily withdraw significant amounts to a USD or other fiat account so naturally all this fighting and shit flinging annoys me to no end.
