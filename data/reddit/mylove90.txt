A mobile wallet with the seed recovery words (like Coinomi for example) would have been more secure than Coinbase

So...I was hodling 0.01 BTC on that wallet...Are these just gone ??
Did paysec really steal BTC from Cubits ?
Is Cubits bankrupt now ?

Is it really an exit scam or undergoing lawsuit ?

This is way too risky... remember not your keys not your coins

So the chance of getting my little money is quite low or what do you think ?
