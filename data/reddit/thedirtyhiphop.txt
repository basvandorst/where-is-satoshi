You either wait for a dip and buy then or buy now and ride the wave. The dip may or may not happen. You decide.

Yes if there is no hard fork in the next couple of months and if they can fix bitcoin's scalability issues. If there is a hard fork, it will send the crypto market into a frenzy... ETH or LTC can take dominance of the market.

No one knows if Bitcoin has a future but if it does, it's worth getting in sooner than later. If you do want to buy some, buy an amount you can afford to lose.

lol "regular people". Coinbase is the easiest. You can buy with a card or bank account. Don't get scared by them asking you for pictures of your license, they just need to verify you. Don't leave your coins in coinbase though. Get a wallet like "Breadwallet" (phone) or Exodus (PC) and keep your coins in there.

Obviously BTC is still the market leader. It holds about 48% of the total market cap. Also, most exchanges require us to use BTC to trade. It is the crypto worlds "gold".

It's less secure to leave your coins in the coinbase wallet. Don't worry about asking questions, we all start somewhere. There are other types of wallets such as cold storage/hard wallets, and paper wallets. It's really up to you to decide. There are plenty of videos to learn all of this.

I use Exodus and Breadwallet. There are a ton of coins and some use their own wallets so you need that specific wallet for whichever coin you want to store. Breadwallet only holds Bitcoin but Exodus holds Bitcoin, Ethereum, Golem, Litecoin and a few others. I would suggest Exodus for you since you're just starting and it's a great wallet.
