'bits' is a terrible name! Please no!
@_date: 2014-09-26 06:35:20
Correct, monero / xmr has anonimity built in already

You can buy my guitar course for a 30% discount and i hodl the btc. Www.guitartheoryrevolution.info
Edit: do i deserve downvotes for promoting my little business?

I can see it happening eventually.

Why are you trying to centralise this issue?
People will come up with their own nomenclature.

As a musician another good thing you can do is encourage artists to accept bitcoin themselves. I've started adding btc addresses to my YouTube videos and website.

But what is the gold useful for
@_date: 2014-04-17 07:01:11
Thanks for the feedback. Yes that is something I plan to do.
My day job is in digital marketing and I constantly test how the sales page looks. Big order now buttons seem to get more orders if you can believe it!

At the end of the day it's the crazy hippies, anarchists, libertarians, humanists and 'fringe' people with 'extreme' ideas that are those that change the world. In so many fields and areas of life. 
It's just that after the fact history gets cleaned up people in suits so that it can be made acceptable to the masses. Then they pretend it was their idea all along.
I know it's ironic to quote Apple in this situation, but it applies: 
"Here’s to the crazy ones. The rebels. The troublemakers. The ones who see things differently. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do."

Agree. If there is any promotion it should be towards businesses that can employ it behind the scenes.
Notice how Circle.com doesn't explicitly mention bitcoin at the top of the page?
In stead of spending money on superbowl adverts money should be going into making the technology around bitcoin better.

He's English and lives in the Netherlands. Pretty sure he has more freedom there than he could have in the US.

If btc succeeds you won't have to cash out.

If you want a good quality picture you need to give more than 48 hours. I know someone who could do an excellent one, but he would need a week.
@_date: 2014-05-09 18:55:23
Woohoo! Thanks
@_date: 2014-10-25 12:33:55
I don't mind the idea it's just the name that irks me.
Why use bits when it's used in so many other areas of technology!
Seems insane to me.
@_date: 2014-11-24 19:27:11
BTW some of the google APIs now measure currency down to the micron.
@_date: 2014-10-03 08:46:15
Completely agree. Although i believe the average person needs to be educated on this i think more effort should be made to get industry on board. Don't waste money on commercials invest in bitcoin businesses
@_date: 2014-10-09 14:33:35
So a Hectoshi? I like that. Makes logical sense and people around the world will recognise hecto
@_date: 2014-10-29 13:01:05
i'm so glad bitcoin is only used by average joes in the USA. Every decision should be made with them in mind. Appealing to the lowest common demoninator who will Probably be the last to adopt is definitely the way to go.

Personally I think he gets a bit too preachy / evangelical. 
I prefer presentations by people that are a bit more stoical.

What do you do for them?

I uploaded a couple of songs. The genres are funky indie-rock, ska, alternative rock
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:09:09
 is an overrated discussion point. There are only 250 million Average Joes and a couple of billion average Jose's, Zhang's and Kwame's around the world that don't mind using fractions of btc.
Just check that video about btc use in Uganda on this subreddit:
@_date: 2014-10-09 20:43:25
It's so much easier IMO.
* Megatoshi = 1,000,000 satoshi
* Kilotoshi = 1000 satoshi
* Hectoshi = 100 satoshi
* Decatoshi = 10 satoshi (don't think this will be used much)
* Satoshi = smallest unit
Many people around the world will instantly recognise deca, hecto, kilo and mega.
Kilogram, kilometer, megabyte, deciliter, hectare etc. etc.

I'd like some!

Good idea, stupid name

Or better yet, a filter so you can choose which to show.

Thank you!

As a content creator I agree. While I don't feel entitled to any money for the content I create (guitar courses) I don't feel ashamed about using every bit of my marketing knowledge I have to get people to pay for the full version. 
Personally I don't use ads on my website but understand why others do. Supporting content creators through ad-clicks, donations or buying their products is important.
It seems logical to me to use some of the money you would pay to adblocker for supporting creators so they don't have to show ads.

Never because it's a new currency  / commodity underpinning the global financial system.

I accept btc for my guitar theory course.

The charity is me... please :)
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:50:43
And this is why it was mistake to name them bitcoin wallets in stead of keychains. There are no bitcoins in the wallet, just keys to access the btc wherever you are.

If you play guitar and are interested in music theory you can buy my e-book. PM me for the website. (Don't want to spam the link here).

I like the song. I make music as well. Check out one of my songs: 
@_date: 2013-10-21 12:12:03
Hey thanks for my first BC tip!
Yes it's still all about the music, and always will be. I meet a lot of musicians that have a very entitled attitude about the situation. They feel like people MUST compensate them for their music. But I believe that the market determines the value, and if that's 0, so be it.
But that shouldn't stop musicians from trying to support their hobby (like a lot of hobbies expensive) or career in other ways. 
There are two ways to look at the situation. We can either be angry that we'll never have the 0.00001% chance of 'making it' in the music industry (although that often proved to be huge dissapointment financially speaking)... or we can be happy that we live in a world where people across the globe can listen to our music with a click of a button and that there is scope to fund the hobby in ways other than the paying for music. 
As with a lot of other things post-internet, it's all about cutting out the middle-men and going down the DYI route IMO.

You can get a physical copy of my book Guitar Theory Revolution through Amazon. If you want I can buy a copy and sent it to you for the equivalent BitCoin. :)
Or by the pdf version from my site

Hmmm... I've installed plenty of WP plugins in the past but can't seem to get this one to work.
Should the it be like this plugins/wpsc-merchants?

Shameless plug: If you're into playing guitar check out my course which sells for the equivalent of US$20 in btc. Normal price is $47
Scroll down to get to the btc payment option:

I run a site that teaches guitar players music theory in a fairly unique way. I provide lots of free videos and lessons but also have an online course for sale (150 page PDF, more than 20 MP3s). Normal price is $47 but in btc it's the equivalent of $20.

Thanks for setting it up.

By awkward I meant for the user. Apparently it isn't user-friendly for people who want to pay with it.
