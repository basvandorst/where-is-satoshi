I had a very similar opinion about a year ago. This is the free market at play. But these days it appears that you increase your risk by trusting any network which is less secure. I mean, if anyone were to exploit anything on these clones (ecc, etc), they'd surely do it on a chain which has less eyes on it 
@_date: 2018-09-24 15:18:20
Agreed, blockchains are just data structures or cryptographic linked lists. Pity blockchain is being isolated as the innovation behind bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-09-23 07:35:15
No, without consensus based immutability a blockchain is not of much use when developing money, and why isolating blockchain as the innovation behind bitcoin being a common misunderstanding of both

630000 - 537955 = 92045 blocks till the next halvening

Bitcoin is a protocol, not a company. So this is a more inline with the successor to TCP/IP
@_date: 2018-08-31 07:02:00
Thanks for pointing this out, and yes, I misinterpreted your message. I think the practicality of spinning up a subsequent chain using the same combination of tech is where I have some concerns, as prior to the bitcoin network, we had no idea weather or not this may work. Any project initiating itself following the current network effect of Bitcoin is vulnerable to 51% attacks and merely serve as testbeds for evaluating which technologies might be considered for adoption. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 16:05:33
A blockchain is just a data structure, or hashed linked list or append only log, not a protocol. What makes it immutable is how we reach consensus on establishing what goes into it. This is where bitcoin comes into play as a protocol which just happens to use this data structure. 
1. blockchain database (decentralized, replicated database)
2. consensus algorithm (open, decentralized, i.e. proof of work)
3. native intrinsic asset (reward for competition)
4. extrinsic energy risk/cost

In short, Pretty Good Privacy (**PGP**) is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. It's very well tested and used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications. This tutorial suggests how bitcoin can be added it the list of use cases :D 
@_date: 2019-03-11 16:45:23
Good question! PGP is fairly well adopted and used, so this tutorial suggests how bitcoin can be added it the list of use cases. There might be other interesting use cases depending, but imagine an existing HTTPS server (hosting it's own keys for encrypting data) or other secure protocols like sftp, ssh can be used as signing devices. These after-all just secure keys which would be useful to sign transaction. It's kind of like hosting content as we are accustomed, but extending already well establish protocols to further prolificate the usage of bitcoin as a value type for the internet.

Agree that comparing these by address is not the right metric based on the Bitcoin UTXO model, and ethereum's account based model. Also not sure if this metric is based on the collection of addresses for inputs, outputs or both combined. These do however serve two different purposes, and to be fair, I'm still trying to figure out a problem which sees compute being censored, but that's a different story altogether.  A more relevant metric however might be that the transactions collectively take all the "DApps" running on ethereum into account (around 1400 based on dappradar), whereas, in context of ethereum, bitcoin is a DApp (a much better one too), then it could be considered orders of magnitude higher in adoption than any single DApp on etheruem. Even if we compare it to the peak of its tx throughput  on 4 Jan 2018 of 1340K TX's per day compared to bitcoin's highest at on 14 Dec 2017 at 490K. 
That means that at its peak, each DApp on ethereum potentially had only 957 transactions per day, whereas bitcoin had 490K.
Then again, instead of comparison by counting metrics, weighing them might be more relevant.

@_date: 2018-04-18 03:16:19
Your question lacks a sense of entrepreneurship chap, as you are spoilt for choice when considering the possibilities here. As indicated in some of the comments, providing such services is purely limited to what the mind can achieve when considering bitcoin is programmable money, or a content type as expressed by Andreas Antonopoulos. Some might even argue that providing loans using bitcoin would far outweigh many inefficiencies of the existing system of debt by fractional reserve banking. 
In fact, I think an inherent issue with owning physical property is the false perception of ownership. I personally live in a country where property is being seized from its land owners through the expropriation of land without compensation, so until this problem is solved, I prefer using a system based on ownership, not debt and externalised trust.

The other way around actually. My annoyance after enduring years of numerous fraudulent transaction and suspended cards, frozen or service interruptions on accounts, hours of phone calls, emails and sms's and denied credit due to negligence of various system errors, charged absurd fees with correction to be administered at my own expense and time, not to mention time spent standing in queues at branches who are unable to service me online or telephonically over a period of 20 years, I closed down my account. 
I earned bitcoin as a primary income and service my living from it. I consider myself fairly technical, and have not been frustrated or left feeling despondent, in fact, I've felt more empowered and in control. So less of an annoyance on the banks part, as for my frustrations, well, that surely has been less so over the last 2 years 
@_date: 2018-04-21 20:57:49
No denying that, I'm emphasising the minimal effort of obtaining access to bitcoin. If I had to extend on the maintenance and utilisation nightmare of dealing with a bank, including hours of phone calls, administration for sorting out RVN's and OTP's, stopping cards, dealing with fraud prevention etc of the banking system, we'd be here for a while, and I don't think either of us have the time for that

Firstly, I'm not a US citizen, but our local authorities have recently published information about how they intend on enforcing regulations around cryptocurrencies. Been having some thoughts around the disclosure of crypto holdings to the authorities as a huge consumer protection risk. Neither them, any government, bank or company have been able to protect citizens from identity theft, a fundamental inherent problem of the legacy system, and one of the reasons such information is not required when using bitcoin by design (assuming you avoid custodial services and exchanges, but then you're not really using bitcoin). 
A further concern is the future breaches which might become more prevalent following the instantiation of the Automatic Exchange of Information (FATCA AND CRS), which has lead to the sharing of personally identifiable information between 50+ participating countries. Exposing such information could lead to personal liabilities and security risks if not secured and authorities held accountable for the protection thereof. The amount of information automatically exchanged is frightening, and adding personal crypto assets would expose one to further risk of such information falling into the wrong hands.

My responses noted based on the paragraphs above, with additional further material I suggest anyone with these same misconceptions have. 
1. Bitcoin does protect a key holders funds, it doesn't however protect you from yourself or loosing your private keys... yet
2. Perhaps you might be less dismissive of the concerns highlighted above if it was your money, not your dads. Be that as it may, it is far more concerning that you are unable to distinguishing between using custodial services such as MTGox (exchanges) or even Ponzi schemes such as Bitconnect.
3. We've all come to the realisation that bitcoin is not anonymous many year ago, it's pseudonymous
4. Your circumstances of these events occurring do not make it less of a problem, your dismissal of them based on frequency are however concerning to say the least
5. Don't be fooled by the majority of opportunists out there trying to distinguish blockchain as being the innovation behind bitcoin, or even worse, separating it
I'd recommend checking out

All good mate, we've been porting HTLCs to javascript and successfully executed a cross chain atomic swap between bitcoin and litecoin using nothing but a browser earlier this month. This approach undermines exchanges, both centralized or decentralized. Decentralized exchanges obviously being reincarnations of centralized exchanges executed on top of a decentralized virtual machine. So nothing new there. I'm amazed at how the ecosystem is trying to introduce intermediated services to something which is disinter-mediated by design... Vive la résistance!

The complexity of contacts you can write using bitcoin script is very misunderstood and under appreciated for sure. The paper outlines "online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution". Majority of smart contracts developed on Ethereum contradict this by favouring intermediation by contract. Majority of the contracts deployed have an implied master (owner of the contract), and depending on how they are developed, do not promote benefits of being borderless, neutral, open, or censorship resistant for that matter, on the contrary, most developers are trying to become the leading standard in custodial contracts and data. Proposed sovereign Identity being a very good example of this, and absurd, generating a keypair is the only identity you require, and doesn't require asking anyone for permission to be added to some decentralized "registry" contract
