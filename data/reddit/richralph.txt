If your not bothered why are you creating a post about it? Particularly as it’s your first ever post since opening your account nearly a year ago
I mean bitcoin just went below $10k so while it doesn’t mean it won’t ever recover it’s certainly something that would justify concern 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:20:30
LMFAO. This is my last response - you can’t debate with such irrationality.
Your predicting that the market cap of bitcoin will reach 21 trillion by 2020. That’s bigger than the US economy.
Your basing this on a website called “Moonmath” (does the name not make you question it?) which argues this through the assumption that because the price doubled in the 28 days ending the 13th December it will continue to double every 28 days forever.. 
Two pretty fundamental points:
1) The website hasn’t updated since 13th Dec - dare I say because the price hasn’t doubled in the 28 days after then. In fact if we take their approach (which is completely flawed) then based on the last 28 days bitcoin is going to zero
2) the website says bitcoin will reach $1m by July 2018 so you can’t even read the website
Please sell all your bitcoin for your own good. You really really worry me

Touché - and multiple times :o

I probably shouldn’t even dignify you with a response but it’s you who fails to grasp basics here.
My only source is widely known statistics knowledge. I did however do a statistics exam at uni (all be it as part of the Geography course so not as advanced as the real statisticians).
Ultimately responses like yours are the biggest argument for a potential bubble in crypto. The analysis provided here is simply not analysis in any way or form. You should be careful investing under the belief it is such 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:36:15
“In the knowledge”
You mean “In the belief”
There’s far from any guarantee it will ever go up again 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:37:17
But he’s right. It’s not “statistically good.” What statistical analysis have you done? Looking at three pictures is not statistical analysis so none at all.
Also, go back one more year and this theory falls flat..
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:26:32
No it isn’t. They got rich by value investing which is analysing the fundamental value of a stock,  not its past price movements.
If you analyse every month of this data set it would further the point these graphs are irrelevant since there is virtually no correlation in any of the other months. I.e. the movement in all three graphs in any given month is pretty much different all the time which just furthers the point that the authors noticed trend in the one month where there is a trend is a coincidence

Why have transaction fees risen so much? Forgive me if it’s a stupid question but I don’t understand why an increase in value or quantity of transactions should intrinsically cause this?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:25:49
This is why I personally struggle to see bitcoin as anything but speculation. People say it can be a new currency (and it could) but whilst ever it takes 13 days for a transaction to process its got no chance in hell. Hopefully they continue to work on this.
Sure crypto currencies are probably going to have a serious future but I think it will be a different crypto to bitcoin that is more facilitative to being an every day currency
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:08:16
So you can make a 72% annual return? Doesn’t seem right 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:33:06
No your wrong. Apart from a select few countries with hyperinflation there is no currency bitcoin is more stable than.
Also not sure what your point is about paper money being volatile during a fictitious transition faze. That just didn’t happen 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:12:51
If it’s that easy you should do it then!
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:33:46
Your confusing blockchain for bitcoin. They are mutually exclusive things and should not be valued together.
Blockchain could change the world financial system and bitcoin could still hit a value of zero if a different coin utilises blockchain in a more efficient way 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:16:58
This graph is a joke, are you seriously showing this to try convince yourself and others of your argument?
The scale isn’t even logarithmic, it’s purely artificially manipulated to make the latest 40% crash look tiny even though it is the biggest (both in absolute and % terms)
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:57:50
Wasn’t aware you were an expert on CDOs, finance and the 2008 crisis!
But hey it’s cool to blame someone and make incredibly complex situations look black and white
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:54:30
Such a fantastic currency when you can’t even use it for over 5 days eh!
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:20:53
Your really comparing investing in bitcoin vs stocks? Stocks have real cash flows and assets secured against them.
They are completely different to bitcoin with different sources of value. At the end of the day bitcoin is far more speculative and that is that. Your only convincing yourself it’s not.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:36:07
Ah sorry I misunderstood. I definitely think a lot of the retail investors (particularly ones late to the party) do not appreciate the difference though!
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:53:48
Your missing the point, the restaurant trade is notorious for fraud and embezzlement. The cash never hits the till, a true receipt is never issued etc.
There wouldn’t even be journals in a general ledger to check 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:01:49
Ah thank you, I can see how a market for fees is created when there is limited room. What you have said is interesting as it does beg the question of how bitcoin will ever be a viable currency if the more it is used the more transaction fees rise.
Why is an optional fee even required though? What prevents me just processing a transaction to the blockchain without paying anyone anything. Who are the fees paid to? I don’t hold bitcoin because I don’t fully understand it, however I thought it was a fully decentralised ledger and therefore no fees payable

He might also be missing out on the big crash.
Its a life changing sum of money to him and so having the security of knowing he won't lose the money beats the chance of potentially earning more
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:42:14
I guess for luxuries fair enough. If you’d have to sell if your car broke down or boiler broke that is more risky tho!
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:39:25
You are invested to the point you have to sell to afford purchases?
Christ at least have an emergency fund. Investing so much you have to sell for additions is risky as hell and is the cardinal sin of personal finance (let alone then investing in one of the most volatile assets)
