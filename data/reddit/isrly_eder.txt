This looks like an undergrad with one year of stats under their belt looking for regressions that will "prove" a conclusion they've already set their mind to. 
The KS test is simply inappropriate to the sample. The fact that a large fraction of bitcoin returns come after tethers are issued may simply be due to the fact that tethers are issued when the price has already dropped, and bitcoiners have a strong dip-buying tendency. This is not causal in any way.  Ascribing a percentage of bitcoin's price rise to tether issuance is beyond absurd. That's an inference that absolutely no statistical test can guarantee. 
This is not computed by a statistician, but rather someone with a basic understanding of statistical methodology who is trying to make a point by wowing readers with advanced statistical concepts. 
Lastly, the Benford's law side of the analysis applies a forensic accounting technique typically used in large datasets of a very certain type. This is not the case here. The test is completely irrelevant to the point being made. 
The tethers may be illegitimate, but this proves absolutely nothing.

bitcoin is an alternative monetary system. it is the only cryptocurrency with a credible monetary policy. it will be the only one to successfully transition to a post-block reward miner funding model (ensuring absolute scarcity and the maintenance of the 21m limit). 
other coins make tradeoffs to alter a parameter or two. ultimately they re-centralize control over some aspect of the system to make it more performant. that fragilizes the system and makes it vulnerable to shutdown. 
'better tech' is a complete myth. you just have a spectrum of centralized and decentralized systems. so far, the best and largest community of cryptographers and core devs work on bitcoin, because it has a fair launch, sustainable governance, and doesn't siphon funds to a corporate entity or a small cabal of insiders.

I run coinmetrics and your interpretation is wrong. Txn volume normally refers to the $ value transmitted on chain, not to the number of transactions a day. Bitcoin far, far surpasses Ethereum's transaction volume in terms of economic throughput.
ETh has more transactions but they are individually less meaningful – bitcoin has batched transactions with many more actual transactions per single 'transaction unit'. They also have 20% of the network clogged up with the frivolous cryptokitties. 
Btw, Eth is going through the exact same difficulty with mempool being full, AND their blockchain data size keeps growing at unsustainable rates. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:09:38


what year is it? 
you don't understand bitcoin (""""blockchain"""") if you think a shared history can be maintained without bitcoin's specific incentive structure. 
I work in the industry, and no corporate or private "blockchain" exists in a functional, deployed state. in fact everyone is pulling out of the consortiums now. 
read Saifedean Ammous' book and understand what bitcoin is for. hint: it's not for buying lattes. 
it's also not a currency. your mistake is deciding what it is, and then evaluating it through that lens. bitcoin is better understood as a system, or a network. it's a means of *STORING* and transmitting value. it's very, very good at that. your niggles about txn fees belie the fact that it is used to transmit ~$4b per day (conservative estimate) and it stores hundreds of billions in tamper-proof savings. 
it's the ultimate hedge against government tampering, and the disastrous credit cycle.

not much you can do about a coordinated PR blitz, mempool spam attack, convenient attack on bitcoin after difficulty adjustment, and coordination among known fraudsters to pump a rival coin.

Wait so cutting taxes is cheating Americans out of their wealth? Bitcoin was created to restore individual sovereignty over money. Taxes reduce an individual's ability to control their own destiny - they involve surrendering rights to the state in exchange for some nebulous benefit. 
Liberal talking points don't work here. Liberals generally believe in more government power and oversight, not less. That's why the shrillest and most anxious nocoiners tend to be liberal, because they are worried about individuals retaking power from the nanny state. 
Bitcoin is profoundly inconsistent with nanny-state, high-taxation leftism, and that's just fine.

no pow-based distributed ledger will ever be cheaper, fee-wise than a paypal, visa, mastercard, alipay, or a venmo. never, ever. those centralize systems have massive efficiencies and can reduce fees to effectively 0. but bitcoin was created anyway. not to compete with them on cost – to do something completely different. bitcoin was created, a massively inefficient distributed ledger, to avoid having to trust any 3rd party when transacting. that's really it. bitcoin wasn't "cheap" to use when it was in its early stages – those transactions were subsidized by inflation. it just happened to grow quickly so that inflation was overwhelmed. 
with a pow blockchain you're paying one way or the other. you pay with inflation or with fees. you need to subsidize the miners, remember. bcash pays with inflation, blithely ignorant of the fact that that free lunch will eventually run out. their security model will fall apart after the next halvening or two because inflation won't be sufficient to incent miners to support the chain, making them vulnerable to 51% attacks. bitcoin sustainably pays with fees, fully embracing the transition to the fee-majority subsidy model. 
if you don't want to bother with silly things like trustless 3rd party transacting, you can *pretend* to use a distributed ledger and perform a shallow imitation like staking. but since pure staking doesn't work, you introduce some sort of privileged nodes or checkpointing system, which is just another way of saying "trusted 3rd party". every "successful" PoS system or even an IOTA uses a trusted validator/checkpointer or incorporates PoW as well. remember, using a trusted third party to verify transactions, no matter how it's phrased, is no different than using a venmo or a paypal or a visa. it's just overall less efficient, since it pretends to be decentralized. 
don't be misled into thinking that compromising bitcoin's key features to buy some other functionality (eternal cheap transacting) is worth it. that just returns the entire system to the thing it was created to avoid in the first place.

why is it ridiculous? Bitcoin unleashes stranded energy assets (eg hydro in dams that would otherwise be wasted, or vented methane from oil wells that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere). at $10t, and, say, 1% miner reward, that's a $100b subsidy to whoever can find the cheapest unused energy sources. (today the subsidy is $4.5b). that's just multiplying the current state of affairs by a factor of 20. Add in the fact that mining probably uses about 0.15% of global energy consumption, that takes it to 3%, assuming no new energy sources are found DUE to bitcoin. 
But of course, Bitcoin monetizes otherwise-wasted energy, so the vast majority of that energy intake will come from previously stranded assets, monetized by Bitcoin. 
Very likely, most of that 3% of global consumption is NEW energy, not previously part of the grid.

if you had to guess, what do you think the average fee paid on BTC is right now, per $ spent on chain? 
Care to guess an order of magnitude? 
I'll tell you. To send $1 on Bitcoin, the average fee today is $0.00006. That's 6 cents to send $1000. 
What does this mean? That Bitcoin can easily tolerate an increase in fees to cover security costs. 
Bitcoin today pays about $4.5b to secure the chain, mostly funded through inflation of the monetary base. 
Total annualized throughput on BTC today, adjusted for change, is about $912b. Let's say BTC can increase this by a single order of magnitude to $10T a year. 
Then the relationship between throughput and fees (assuming we kept the subsidy constant) would be about 1:2200. Recall that the fee ratio today is about 1:15000. 
To simulate what sufficient fees would be like, just multiply current fees by 6.75. So your fee to send $1000, in order to generate a fee subsidy of $4.5b a year, if bitcoin can throughput $10T a year, would be about 40 cents. 
Can you deal with a fee of 40 cents to send $1000? That's a percentage fee of four basis points. That's all it will take to secure the chain at today's miner subsidy, in a world where we can scale up usage by a single order of magnitude.

It comes down to inventory management IMO. 
1. buy new miner 
2. mine for a bit (capital efficient) 
3. miner scarcity - sell miner on open market
4. order new miner from bitmain  
5. **keep mining with sold miner while awaiting delivery of new miner**
6. receive new miner, send old miner to buyer
with miners, time is money, and minimizing the time your rig isn't mining is part of the game. this is my guess as to why the strategy is successful – happy to be corrected by OP if this is a wrong assumption. clearly, relying on scarcity on the secondary market driving up the prices isn't a sustainable business model. at some point sufficient miners will be produced.

BTC is the 1.0 version of a very successful idea. It has the first mover advantage, but as we've seen in many industries, the first version of a product is often imperfect, and the 2.0 version often takes over. There are several coins that innovate on Bitcoin to make it truly fungible, private, or scalable. None of them do all of that perfectly, but IMO XMR solves many of BTC's glaring technical flaws. Not that I believe it will take the  spot, but it's evidence that other coins can emerge that will solve BTC's problems if it cannot adapt quickly enough. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 11:25:50
Agreed. I ran a regression yesterday and found that Bitcoin is negatively associated with the [Shanghai Stock Exchange]( at the 5% significance level. However, it's largely indifferent to the Nikkei, the S&amp;P500, the Russel2000, or the Nasdaq. It's positively correlated with gold, unsurprisingly. Regression covers daily values over the last year. 
So BTC is a safe haven in China. For an overvalued Chinese equity market, with heavy household performance, it's primed for an explosion when Chinese equities drop. That said, BTC is not considered (or doesn't behave like) a safe haven in the US... yet. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 13:59:23
Guessing you saw [this paper]( 
Your post piqued my interest so I found [correlations between BTC returns and those of other altcoins]( for returns over the last year. 
I then ran a regression to find what explained BTC's variation, since correlations don't tell you that. I regressed BTC returns against some of the more correlated altcoins and the Russel 2000, S&amp;P500, the Shanghai stock index, the Nikkei, the Nasdaq, and the gold price. (working on figuring out how to get data on currency exchange rates...)
[Results here]( 
What it means is the following: 
1. The 8 dependent variables explain 52% of the variation in BTC returns 
2. Litecoin is by far the most significant variable - an increase in LTC price is associated with an increase in BTC price 
3. The Shanghai index is negatively associated with BTC price, significant at the 5% level (strong significance) 
4. Gold is positively associated with BTC, with weak significance (at the 10% level)
5. The Nikkei and American indexes do not explain variations in BTC returns 
An R^2 value of .52 is pretty encouraging. Note that these returns are for the last 365 days.

Excellent post. Correlations are very misleading for several reasons. 
1. if you're correlated assets by price, and there's an upward trend, they'll be correlated because of the trend and not because of a relationship. solution is to use returns 
2. correlations fluctuate wildly, so you generally need a fair amount of data before they start being meaningful
3. 'uncorrelated' assets become correlated during negative shocks 
4. backwards looking correlations aren't necessarily predictive of the future 
5. correlations aren't particularly informative. regressions can isolate direct relationships between two variables and correct for confounding variables. 
I am always tempted to find correlations between assets I'm interested in, but there are about 1000 caveats you need to mention before using them as a benchmark. however markowitz portfolio optimization is built on correlations. they're huge in traditional portfolio theory. BTC's general uncorrelation with other assets is precisely why institutional investors are getting interested in it, as the author said 
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:17:46

sentiment can change catastrophically in an instant. let's say china raids the biggest mining pools. or satoshi appears and dumps his bitcoins - 5% of total supply - claiming he's disenchanted with the currency. or the US makes it illegal to buy things with bitcoin. or the scalability problem never gets fixed. or coinbase gets hacked and closes down with everyones money. or the etf is approved and collapses with 300m of investor capital. 
these things can happen. they might be black swan events but they have a nagging tendency to hit bitcoin. 
look at equity market crashes. 1987 and 2000 specifically. sentiment changes sooo quickly, and by the time you've realized that something is fucked, it's too late. no one thinks it'll happen to them. and then it does.

realized cap takes every coin issued and prices it according to its value **when it last moved on chain**. if you assume that a new coin purchase = an on chain settlement (big assumption, not always true), you can use this methodology to estimate the average cost basis of all bitcoin holders, collectively. so, if the market cap is above $100b, your average bitcoin holder is in profit, and vice versa. it's a neat metric because it doesn't count as relevant coins which haven't moved since 2009/10.

let's say mining yielded $500/day and $5/day in heat value. 
if everyone used their rigs for spare heat, and "sold" that additional $5 (by reducing their heating bill by $5) they could plow that additional $5 into their mining rig, and increase their mining capability by 1%. what happens when hash rate increases?

nope, it doesn't. it factually does not. you're using electricity figures and imagining that the electricity is produced with non-renewable energy. 
here's the reality: most bitcoin is mined in rural china where hydropower was installed several decades ago and excess capacity was installed. no one uses that energy, so it's sold at a loss to miners who engineer sweetheart deals with local administrators. hydro isn't 0-footprint, but it's a lot better than oil or gas or coal. much of this energy would be wasted were it *not* for bitcoin. 
some bitcoin is mined with conventional power. that's fine. it provides a super valuable service. eventually solar will become the dominant means of generation, and bitcoin will be mined with utility level scale (suits solar since it doesn't really matter where the electricity is generated).

They're referring to Willy Woo's NVT - network value to transactions  ratio. Takes the value of bitcoin, 70b or whatever, and divides it by the value of on-chain transactions per day. Bitcoin has anywhere between 500m and 2b in USD transmitted on-chain per day. So there you go. You get a nice little ratio. 
It's informally called Bitcoin's P/E by some idiots, hence this fuck up here. Because it's conceptually similar to PE, but not really. 
The blockchain.info part refers to their estimate of on-chain transaction volume in dollars. It's not necessarily a perfect estimate, so that is a serious caveat.

It's just a tool like any other. Do you mock people who lost money in Gox for getting repaid through Japanese courts? Business registered in the US are beholden to US law – if they're breaking it, we are fully empowered to react.
In this case, the legal system is a potential ally of Bitcoin as originally envisioned, since a fraudulent attack is taking place. It's just a useful quirk of the court system. Usually we're largely unconcerned with whatever courts have to say (within reason), in this instance they stand to help our cause.

There is some precedent for building better estimates of unique users ("entities") in the bitcoin system. It requires the application of heuristics which "cluster" addresses and tag them to users. There is even open source software which facilitates this (blocksci). Some links: 
- Meiklejohn et al, 2013: 
- Narayanan et al 2017: 
- McGinn McElwraith and Guo 2018: 
I think this is a way to practically improve a model. Due to the idiosyncrasies of Bitcoin, 'unique addresses' is a poor proxy for unique entities.

I think this is a tremendously important finding. It has often said that bitcoin works in practice and not in theory. I'm not too familiar with other work on the topic but my understanding is that there are few or no economic models which find a positive value for bitcoin in equilibrium. This is an interesting way to describe the "trust bootstrapping" that happened in the early days of bitcoin.


This makes sense to me. Since Bitcoin is premised on predictability in terms of the cost to mining and the resultant clarity in determining the cost to reverse a transaction, a degradation in that predictability might affect trust in the network. If an ASIC was invented which was a 1000x speedup on latest hardware, accumulated PoW would "leak", as those proofs would be cheaper to revert, relative to the cost to have made them in the first place. 


Nice to see this confirmed, makes perfect sense as it is a general feature of asset valuation.
Your comment on price-hashrate spirals in the paper is interesting. It does make intuitive sense that if price and hashrate are tightly interlinked and have a reflexive relationship on the way up (price rises catalyze new hashrate, additional hashrate increases trust which bolsters price), that the same can be true on the way down. I think bitcoin's slow difficulty adjustment helps mollify this. 
This is very exciting to read now that I've understood what the paper does. I'm glad you took the time to communicate the findings, there is often a huge gap between academia and industry, and this kind of discussion, even if it seems informal, is tremendously helpful.

Thank you so much for the detailed answers. My intuition is that the marginal effect of hashrate, after it has cleared a certain imaginary threshold of "sovereign-grade attack resistance" is probably negligible on the perceived value of Bitcoin. What's the difference between a network with 20 and 21 exahashes per second? It is just arbitrarily high numbers at that point. I think the greatest adversaries at that point are subtler attacks like infiltrations on the core developer team or attacks on fiat onramps (exchanges). 
Some attention has been granted to *relative* changes in hashrate. For instance: 
This shows how many days an adversary with 100% of Bitcoin hashrate would take to rewrite the entire chain. You'll notice that it changes – dramatically sometimes, when new hardware is introduced or lots of hashrate comes online all at once. Some Bitcoiners pay attention to this, although the threshold is still incredibly high to clear. 
Ultimately, as far as hashrate is concerned, I think the biggest actual threat is the concentration of hashrate among single entities. That would make them vulnerable to tampering from the State. The absolute number of hashrate in h/s is probably not as important as the GINI coef for instance.

On-chain volume for Bitcoin was between 1b and 5b a day for most of 2017, however you can't add that up and derive a GDP. 
GDP is the value of all *final* goods and services in a year. You can't double count things in the supply chain as they go through modifications. For instance, you dont count the cost to mine aluminum, smelt it, deliver it to a manufacturer, and make it into the car – you count the added value at each step or only the final value of the car. Otherwise you end up with a weird inflated figure. 
OP isn't counting the value of goods and services sold in the bitcoin economy (which is plausible, yet difficult), he is aggregating transaction load. That's more akin to counting the monetary base. We already have a word for that – M1 or M2.

Your summary is a little bit unclear on what you think the impact of the reward halving would be. Under a naive EMH model, the halving would be known ahead of time and shouldn't have a meaningful effect on price (as long as hashrate also responds in a predictable, known, way to the reward decline). Can you clarify what your model has to say about the impact of the halving?

Everyone should read the entire *Treatise* by Poesltra. It's pretty eye-opening. Satoshi didn't select any of the relationships and figures involved in bitcoin arbitrarily. He picked them so the whole thing would function. It's a bit like the design of an airplane. Sure you could make the wings twice as long but that would kind of throw everything else off. 
Once people understand this, they'll realize why fiddling with the block size is a horrifically bad idea. The best reasoning I've found is from Paul Sztorc's [blog]( 
My summary: 
1. Satoshi built it with the expectation that nodes would be *perfectly* decentralized, or at least close to that. 
2. Non-decentralized P2P systems are vulnerable to all sorts of attack and should generally be avoided at all costs. This includes only partially decentralized systems.   
3. There's a near-perfect correlation between decentralization and the cheapness of a node.   
4. Blocksize increases would raise the cost of a node, to absurd levels that individuals cannot cope with   
5. Blockwise increases would permanently hinder decentralization and make bitcoin vulnerable to cooption and control by state actors
I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but once I understood this, I immediately grasped why a blocksize increase was a bad idea.

I may not agree with everything the US govt does but they aren't terrorists, simply by definition.

Back in the "who is Satoshi" days, Szabo was considered the most likely candidate by those who knew what they were talking about, as opposed to just the media. He kind of suspiciously edited some blogs he made about his digital gold system so they'd look like they were published after the SN white paper came out, not before. I don't personally think he's Satoshi - but he is a key contributor to the project and the cypher punk landscape and his opinion is worth a huge amount

@_date: 2018-04-16 15:29:59
Could you elaborate on the relationship between changes in the cost to mine a bitcoin and the trust in the system/pricing? You say:


Does this mean: if mining a bitcoin gets cheaper (i.e if it costs $3000 to mine a bitcoin and an ASIC is released which reduces that to $300), then the effect on price would be negative? Would this be because it is now cheaper to reverse the history of the chain, as equipment is more efficient? And this damages the trust individuals have in the network security?

these tend to increase centralization.


transmitted and verified. This destroys consensus since nodes are essentially always seeing
competing blockchains in the past. (Remember that consensus time is measured by total
blockchain difficulty, roughly, blockheight.) Therefore the first chain that they see will always
appear longer than the others, and every node will have a different idea of the best chain.
This happened to feathercoin, which had 60-second blocks. They were unable to achieve
distributed consensus, so the network was changed to require developer signatures on all
blocks. (They purchased the blocksigning code from Peercoin, whose problems with consensus
are detailed in Section 6.4]). Therefore their currency has a centralized consensus; since the point of proof-of-work is to achieve distributed consensus,
mining on feathercoin is entirely pointless.

I've met plenty of people in high finance that despite bitcoin or dismiss it as irrelevant nerd trash. It's gaining in reputation now but a system which removes inefficiencies they feed on is a general threat to their existence, in the long term. 
If dutch auction ICO's become a standard model (a lot of improvement would need to occur), bang, the brokerages are gone. They are no longer needed to mediate access to capital markets. 
If fees go down bitcoin becomes a viable remittance service, western union and retail banking fees disappear. 
If regulated blockchain/bitcoin personal banking products appear (guaranteed by the FDIC [not likely but my personal wet dream]) then retail banks actually disappear. 
If smart contracts + AI develop to a stage where decentralized self-enforcing contracts are actually viable, contract lawyers disappear. 
If decentralized exchanges become popular and viable, and work for not just tokens but equity and other asset classes, that's a threat to both the settlement organizations oligarchy and the old school exchanges (NYSE etc). 
Banking, at every level, thrives on inefficiency. Self-executing contracts and decentralized banking poses a threat to all of that. Think big. Of course all of this is basically speculative and long term but I think these use cases could develop within 5-15 years.

It's actually incredible, and it blows my mind all the time. I consider Satoshi one of the preeminent geniuses of our time. He blended a totally expert knowledge of cryptography (&lt;100 people worldwide have this) with genius, virtually bug free programming, an incredibly forecasting ability, a consummate understanding of game theory and economics, and he managed to put together a self-sustaining system that will last until the last computer is destroyed. He also calibrated it just right, so it would work fine and the nodes would proliferate and it would remain secure. It's fucking amazing what he did, and I consider it one of the greatest one-man inventions of all time.

that's basically my interpretation of the big block crowd. and a definition that seems to make sense to me. people who see a problem and decide that the solution is arbitrarily altering the problematic variable without any thought to consequences. they don't understand nuances like block size being a tradeoff between decentralization and throughput.
to the untutored with no knowledge of bitcoin history, it's plausible that Craig Wright is Satoshi. to the informed, he's obviously not. but these things aren't clear to these types.

ISIS calling itself a state doesn't make it a state. It doesn't really fulfill the essential characteristics. Which include governance, sovereignty, territory, and so on. They have some of those not all. 
Not applying the terrorism moniker to states doesn't mean they're blameless. Just that their actions fall under the more typical labels of waging war and so on. Note: they can sponsor terrorism but if they roll out tanks and start bombing places directly that's not terrorism, that's war. Terrorism is normally asymmetric - i.e. the terrorists generally wouldn't prevail in a straight open battle. That's why terror tactics are used. 
It's a source of active debate but attempting to conflate state actions with terrorism is usually a sign that someone doesn't understand the nuance of the situation. Calling a large established state the largest terrorist globally is just a misapplication of the term. If it was being applied to a fringe case like the ones you mention it might have some merit but it just doesn't work in the case of the US.

Adam Back: in favor of segwit, since he's the CEO of blockstream.
David Chaum seems kind of disconnected from the bitcoin space, his work was vital in getting bitcoin started but he's never had a formal role in the protocol as far as I can tell. He generally favors anonymity and cypherpunk principles. 
Wei Dai is interesting because his B-money is explicitly [2 layer]( Just like bitcoin would be with a lightning network. So 
it has a transaction level and a settlement level. So I guess he'd be in favor of a 2 layer solution although I hesitate to speak for him. 
Hal Finney passed away in 2014 so I have no idea, although he'd probably be in favor of whatever mechanism preserved individual privacy and control, over anything else.

Wences is firmly in the Barry Silbert camp, so I guess he just wants whatever will allow him to make the most money

Mark Karpeles is disgraced and was basically an opportunist as far as I can tell, he never was actually particularly in bitcoin or protecting his users, and he threw them under the bus with Mt Gox.

eventually, people accustomed to traditional economics will attempt to impose inflationary monetary policy on bitcoin (notice how all of the newer cryptocurrencies have a tail emission). this is due to the belief that money supply is tethered to economic growth. the debt/credit system requires the continual devaluation of savings in order to force individuals to invest or consume. of course, this standard isn't necessary, it's just a mechanism that allows our consumptive capitalism system to exist. alternatives exist (imagine a world in which people consumed on a need basis rather than a "my money will be destroyed otherwise" basis) but they aren't popular, since society fetishizes growth and expansion. anyway, I imagine that these growth fetishists will ultimately make their way to bitcoin and attempt to impose their will on it.

Fantastic comment. Ethereum spelled their inevitable doom when they rolled back the chain and showed their willingness to edit "unsavory" transactions. They will be called upon to do this again – and if they cooperate they'll disillusion their users; if they refuse, they will be jailed.

according to my very scientific* [market to transaction value ratio]( Litecoin is very modestly valued. I actually bought some LTC on the strength of this analysis. 
^*not ^that ^scientific

Check ethereum median fees again

I was making a tongue in cheek joke about there being infinite ethereum (because of uncapped emission) and hence infinite scammy ICOs.

It's the only function, but not a good one.

TBH there's no safe haven in crypto right now, just with BTC people are generally aware of the risks whereas with ETH people are blissfully ignorant.

Thank you for the response. You seem to have an incredible understanding of bitcoin. Are you Paul Sztorc's alt or something? Lol

watch the movie the inside job and tell us again how the regulators, the ratings agencies, the bankers, and the issuers of mortgage back securities that blew up the world economy weren't corrupt

then you haven't been looking hard enough. 
just contrast it with ethereum's use cases. if someone tells you they love ethereum, ask them "what's your favorite smart contract?"

If you're long term bullish you're bullish. Goldman are playing both sides here. They don't care about being right they just want to encourage clients to trade.

You wont want to buy if ETH hits $35 (assuming similar level to Mt Gox drawdown). Everyone says they'll pick up undervalued assets but then the crash happens and they don't want to buy any more...

Feels like a year ago that bitcoin was worth $1200

crypto-anarchy as I understand it is generally libertarian, UBI seems totally incompatible with it. I have firm cryptoanarchist leanings and I find UBI totally antithetical to the position. we need less government, not more.

Bitcoin isn't particularly amenable to being an anti-censorship or pure crypto-anarchy coin. Blockchain analysis is a real thing. It's really only a matter of time until the undesirables start getting busted by the feds. There are a couple communities that haven't totally sold out, luckily. I'll let you figure them out. Hint: it involves total transaction anonymity by default.   
Of course, bitcoin is useful for many things, but resisting government interference probably isn't one of them, unless default privacy is somehow developed.

Aragon: in alpha. Less than a month old
Akasha: private testnet. Pre-alpha. Claimed launch Q3/Q4 2017
Golem: in alpha. Has one "market ready" use case at present 
Storj: actually in beta! awesome. works! no one [actually]( [uses]( it, but whatever. fuck adoption! 
eth's fees aren't great either. I admit bitcoin's fees utterly suck right now, but at least the tech is there to reduce them... eventually

Well given that the federal agents got treated with kid gloves and Ulbricht got life in prison in part because of their actions I'd say suspicion of any of the prosecutors involved is warranted

as many as there are Ethereum still to be mined
