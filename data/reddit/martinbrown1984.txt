Thanks! Okay, so May's "timed-release crypto" email in 1993 described a "reputation-based system", but didn't get into any crypto details. The Rivest paper in 1996 described the crypto of time-lock puzzles, and then separately the implementation details of May's timed-release crypto based on a secret-sharing threshold of "trusted agents". The two are so different that its confusing that they're even in the same paper.
With time-lock puzzles, Alice generates her own puzzle and throws away her own key. With timed-release crypto, Alice shares bits of her key with m-of-n trusted agents.
The Timechain scheme in the OP mashes up the two, trusting a "timechain" (initialized by one guy with a GPU cluster) operator to throw away a multi-sig private key. I see no advantage over a simple m-of-n escrow (other than providing an opportunity for unemployed GPUs). The reason timelock puzzles are secure is because there are no trusted agents involved. Alice only has to trust herself to throw away her own key.

Kudos for the LevelDB work. But using BDB wasn't the cause of the fork, it was the implicit default of max_locks=10000, which somebody might have thought to increase had it been set explicitly in a DB_CONFIG file. But uncovering subtle bugs like that is tedious and time consuming (much easier to tell everyone to upgrade and then if something goes wrong, blame those who didn't).
If you're so worried about mempool capacity limits causing nodes to crash, the responsible thing to do would be to submit a patch to fix mempool. Not to orchestrate a PR blitz campaign with a "bigger is better" slogan to rabble rouse the masses, arguing on the basis of "years at google" and some monte carlo sims that "We have to increase the block size NOW!!! or bitcoin will become the next myspace!" And then to threaten a fork with the deposed leader, using a bunch of with-us-or-against-us rhetoric to misrepresent those who don't get behind you as members of a corrupt conspiracy opposing a block size increase only to further their corporate interests and pet projects. That's more like a violent coup attempt and a shameless power grab, under the guise of fighting for users.

The claim is that if a multi-sig escrow agent throws away their key, then they're no longer a trusted third-party because the key is time-locked. But that's faulty logic. You can't verify that they threw it away, so you have to trust them. The argument boils down to "well its not in their business interest to act maliciously".. the exact same logic that leads people to trust centralized exchanges.

The idea is that banks are legally registered entities. Legal liability is their incentive to validate transactions on a distributed ledger, whereas miners are anonymous and thus need an incentive token. And so banks etc. will use cryptographically validated shared distributed ledgers to settle transactions among themselves, because its cheaper than buying a shitton of sha256 chips and burning electricity to earn tokens. Plus they want to be able to correct errors and mistakes in the ledger, which they can't do if they're using bitcoin's blockchain.

Having lots of honest full nodes is what protects against sybil attacks (spinning up a bunch of malicious nodes on a botnet) that can disrupt block propagation. If one botnet has more ip addresses than the number of honest full nodes, then chances are that a randomly connected peer will be a malicious node. The biggest threat from such a sybil attack is that it enables selfish-mining to succeed with a smaller fraction of the total hashpower. The easier it is for an attacker to disrupt block propagation, the less hashpower they need to selfishly mine 100% of the blocks. An attacker could control the chain with as little as 1% of the hashpower, if there are so few honest full nodes that they can disrupt block propagation between honest miners.


The ironic thing about Gavin's rush to increase the block size, is that it was the same rushed approach under his leadership that caused the 0.7.2/0.8 unplanned hard fork. The hard limit was doubled from 512kb to 1mb in 0.8, but most pools that upgraded to 0.8 stayed cautious and left the target size (aka "soft limit") at 512kb. Gavin encouraged pools to increase their target size to 1mb. Slush did so, and mined a 0.9+ mb block not long thereafter. The testnet had seen some big blocks, including blocks with lots of txouts, but not blocks with lots of txins. The slush block had lots of txins, causing the unplanned hard fork. It was only after the unplanned hard fork that Gavin decided it'd be a good time to [test an instrumented 0.7.2](
The community was quite lucky to have recovered from the unplanned hard fork as quickly as they did. At the time, BTC price dropped from ~$50 to ~$30 in a matter of minutes. Had eleuthria (administrator of the BTCguild mining pool) been asleep at the time, he wouldn't have been able to downgrade to 0.7.2 soon enough to get the forks to reorganize. The 0.8 chain would've grown too long, and cleanup would've been much more difficult. (note that at the time, [Gavin preferred]( to let the 0.8 chain grow).

That came out in May 2012. And only mobile usage was projected to double (92% CAGR compound annual growth rate). Plus those numbers are for total bandwidth usage, primarily from a growing number of users. Its not growth in the average user's internet speed.

Your upgraded mempool scenario is a straw-man scenario. A fix wouldn't mean capping the size so small that reject messages are sent out and tx's are dropped. Why is that the block size could be increased, but not the mempool size?  Its not a fair comparison.
Plus, you outlay worst-case scenarios where a majority of users are still running old versions without a mempool fix (and no smart fee handling, merchants running old wallets, etc.). If you did comparable pessimistic straw-men scenarios for an increased block size, it would sound like a terrible solution too ("most wallets wouldn't even recognize such big blocks, or they'd crash."  and "disk space would run out, and nodes would crash left and right.") In such scenarios, bigger blocks would fare just as badly if not worse.

The timechain was a component mentioned briefly in his whitepaper for Uptrenda (his proposed p2p exchange). The whitepaper only said "a list of external time-lock providers", this timechain blogpost expands on that.
The uptrenda design is basically similar to lightning.network micropayment channels. But in order for lightning hashed time-lock channels (HTLC) to work, bitcoin tx malleability needs to be fixed, and preferably a new opcode, OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, as well. (Note that bitcoin already has support for nLockTime, which is a tx field. nLockTime is used in the current micropayment channels, but the ways nLockTime can be used are limited because its a tx field, not a script opcode. The new script opcode would enable fancier uses of nLockTime.)
Timechain gets around the requirement that tx malleability be fixed, by the use of some crazy new chain where people use GPUs to do the recursive hashing required for time-lock encryption (time-lock encryption has been around for a while, first proposed in 1993, when it was called "Timed-release crypto"). So rather than set up micropayment channels secured by the bitcoin tx field nLockTime (because again, advanced use of nLockTime channels would require fixing tx malleability and adding a new opcode), Uptrenda proposes to set up micropayment channels secured by multi-sig oracles acting as intermediaries to this crazy new Timechain thing.
@_date: 2015-06-22 13:21:36
Trusted multi-sig oracles would be centralized compared to a script opcode like OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, if they both accomplish the same thing.

But if a rogue escrow agent is pretending to be the other participant, then they can steal my money. So in fact, I do have to trust that the other participant is an honest person (and not colluding with the escrow agent).


But my analogy with centralized exchanges wasn't about a centralized exchange getting hacked. It was about a centralized exchange acting maliciously. When exchanges get hacked, its usually not clear whether it was an inside job (ie. exchange acting maliciously) or whether they were simply incompetent. If the mechanism depends on the exchange acting competently, that implies they must be *trusted* to act competently/non-maliciously. So its not accurate to call it a trustless mechanism.


But it does rely on humans, because there's no way to verify that they actually deleted the keys after time-locking them. You have to trust that they did so.


Thanks. It is much easier to poke holes in proposals than it is to present solutions. What's most difficult is to recognize valid criticism and acknowledge where one went wrong. From what I've seen, people who can do that end up going much further than those who are attached to their ideas and can only respond defensively, particularly in this space (where there are so many shysters). Experts (which I am not) won't waste their time writing feedback to someone who will just blow them off anyway, but they will privately tell others what to ignore and what might actually have promise.
I think your description of a Timechain DAC sounds similar to a sequential proof-of-work blockchain, especially if it has its own native currency. And I think it could have uses, but time-locking private keys to cryptocoins is not an appropriate use case (too many flaws, masked by a rube goldberg design). The silver bullet for decentralized handling of private keys is fully homomorphic encryption. Short of that, utilizing SNARKs would be more practical (there's a already a [library]( and on more solid crypto foundations. Even the thoroughly vetted SNARKs were only recently found to have a potential vulnerability.
If it were easy to mash-up time-lock crypto with AES chains to get a silver bullet for secure decentralized private keys, then what's with all the research on FHE and SNARKs? My guess is that in order to tie up all the loose ends of time-lock chains and get a scheme that's actually secure, you'd end up with something that looks much more like SNARKs or FHE. Not some clever way of stitching time-locks. Right from the start, trying to design a scheme for time-lock chains flies in the face of the [cardinal rule]( "Don't roll your own crypto." Don't even modify a crypto scheme, and certainly don't [compose them like legos]( Its fighting an uphill battle, pissing into the wind.

Fair enough, good points. 
In any case (block propagation optimizations notwithstanding), it was Gavin himself who rationalized his choice of block sizes by a projection of future bandwidth speeds. A good proposal would start with realistic and accurate numbers for that, not pulling them out of thin air or "Nielsen's law". To me, that suggests to a lack of rigor and double-checking (and didn't Gavin make an arithmetic error to arrive at his original 20MB estimate? which when corrected resulted in the 8MB estimate?). Careful analysis is important, lest everyone forgets what happened the last time the block size was increased...

eleuthria was basically the hero savior during the 0.7.2/0.8 hard fork. At the time, BTCguild was running 0.8 with ~30% of the network hash power. His downgrade to 0.7.2 was what enabled the network to reorganize to the 0.7.2 chain, and orphan the 0.8 chain. The IRC logs during the event are an exciting read.

The first tx that's broadcasted won't necessarily be the one that gets included in the block. What if another person comes along shortly after and broadcasts a tx signed with the same privkey but redeems the coins to a different address, and pays a higher tx fee?

You can't divide the block size by 10 minutes. Blocks need to propagate quickly to prevent a high orphan rate.
@_date: 2015-06-09 04:12:39
The block size debate is more political than technical because the issues in question are more economic than technical. The technical issues are easy to settle by facts, e.g. what's the max block size that could be supported with current average node bandwidth? (supposedly 8MB blocks, not 20MB).
But the political/economic issues would not be easily settled by point-by-point debates. Would a larger block size increase "centralization" (i.e. lead to fewer full nodes)? Is it preferable to have more full nodes? Is it preferable to have low transaction fees? Should users be able to pay for coffee with on-chain transactions? The answers to such questions depend on whether you ask a miner, a user, or an Austrian Economist, and so on. It comes down to political views and opinions, not facts.

It does matter actually. With CPUs and GPUs, average people already own those, so they can mine with only the marginal extra cost of electricity. With an ASIC-resistant algo, its a much larger investment to build a mining center because each miner needs all the general purpose hardware: hard drive, ram, mobo and CPU. So someone starting a mining center has to match that up-front cost and compete against any joe who already has a desktop and broadband. Joe desktop has a clear advantage, because he doesnt have to buy a new one just for mining.
But with ASIC mining joe loses the advantage - he still has to buy an ASIC.

Every high school drop-out won't, their share of the pie is actually declining (in real as opposed to nominal terms). But the majority of the ultra-rich will maintain, or increase, their share of the gains. That's because they'll continue to gain the majority of investment profits (naturally, since they'll be the majority of the investment).
If crypto-currency continues to grow as a mode of investment (alternative or mainstream), then the rich will (and are) undoubtedly extracting most of the investment profits. A lot of smaller-fish early-er adopters (like myself at $0.85), already lost a share of their potential gains by selling to wealthier traders (as wealthier traders have a natural information advantage of knowing when they'll put and pull millions into and out of the market).
And who knows, but if it continues to become a more a common mode, then we'll see more stories of the "got rich from bitcoin" variety, like the "got rich from real estate" or "from the dot com bubble". Stories like "inherited land that was an oil field" are also much more common among wealthy people (since they own more land). And it will be more common for the rich trust-funder kid (who can afford-to-lose a $20k or $200k gamble-vestment) to get rich off bitcoin, than a lower or middle-class kid who makes a smaller investment (or gambles with smaller amounts).

Either you don't know what a non-sequitur is, or you can't follow simple logic.


Oh, that must be why CPUs are just flying off the shelves, everybody is buying them to mine CPU-only coins! Compucenter and newegg literally don't have any CPUs in stock, they're all being bought up for coin mining!
Compare that to special-hardware mining. When poclbm and m0mchil (ATI gpu mining programs) were released, the price of ATI video cards (especially the 5850s and other models with the best hashrate-per-watt) spiked. Newegg, amazon, etc were all back-ordered and used 5850s never really returned to the market. It has continued till today, ASIC miners are constantly back-ordered.
CPU's are not back-ordered, and its not because there aren't any cpu-only coins. Its because there's such a huge supply of CPUs. CPUs are general-purpose, commodity hardware! Litecoins first hit the scene as cpu-only coins, back when bitcoin mining was dominated by GPUs. Did everyone go out and buy a ton of CPUs just to mine Litecoins? NO!


You're right, that is what they did - [knightmb most famously]( - mined a huge amount of BTC with EC2 instances in 2010. Renting EC2 instances is much quicker and cheaper than buying whole freaking commodity computers just for mining a few weeks of low difficulty.

The GPU farms were because people needed to purchase ATI video cards for sha256 hashing. And still, because ATI cards were commodity hardware, there were a lot more GPU farms of smaller sizes than the few huge ASIC datacenters that we see today. You don't think mining with ASICs today is more centralized (both because of pools and because of warehousing) than mining was before with GPUs?? With CPU mining, its even more decentralized. It makes a difference.


No, you don't invest in CPUs. Because you know there are already a huge number of CPUs out there which could come online at much lower cost, raise the difficulty, and kill your returns. On the other hand, you do buy as many ATI GPUs and ASIC chips because you know there are only a limited number of those special-purpose chips so there's a much better chance of the difficulty staying low enough for long enough to earn a return on your investment.

Git and bitcoin both use Merkle trees. so what? Merkle trees are used for all kinds of things, they date back to 1979. Git and bitcoin have very different natures, for one difference bitcoin uses public/private key crypto. Git doesn't use crypto keys at all (just file hashes). Also git is federated, so there is implicit trust in cloning/forking/pulling/pushing to any repos and there is no such thing as a global, decentralized, authoritative repo. Bitcoin is a global, decentralized ledger.


And how does bitcoin do that? By having a notion of dynamic difficulty adjustment. Git has nothing like that at all, not even close. To find a common origin between git and bitcoin you have to go all the way back to 1979! Might as well say all computer programs are imminent because they all run on Turing machines.

For the case of special relativity, the two most pertinent were Lorentz and Minkowsky - that's why their names were bestowed the Lorentz transformation and Minkowsky space (Minkowsky was even one of Einstein's professors). But it wasn't just for that Einstein gets so much genius worship. He was also the first to measure Avogadro's constant using brownian motion. The first to explain the photoelectric effect by using Planck's constant. And then of course general relativity on top of all that.

Regular old bitcoin transactions aren't contracts that hold state (beyond spent/unspent coins). To verify contracts you have to execute them (bitcoin only has to check that the inputs are spendable coins), otherwise you don't know that every change in state that a mined block makes is valid according to the contracts.


CPU cycles are the limiting factor. Every computational step in a contract execution has to be paid for with a "gas" fee (earned by miners, on top of the inflation rate). Thus transaction/gas fees are directly linked to the number of computational steps required to execute them.

HFT algos are usually the "passive" side of a trade, humans are still driving/initiating as the active side. Fat-fingered humans do the driving through execution algos, by giving directions like "sell X shares over the next two hours".
It was execution algos which caused the "flash crash" of 2010. The fat fingers were all selling, but HFT algos need balance. Under a huge imbalance, HFT pulls out. The reaction of dumb execution algos was to sell even faster, regardless of price.

Ethereum mining executes scripts, every script is expressed by different code. If an ASIC was optimized to execute only one type of script, pushing a new script to the Ethereum blockchain would "poison" that ASIC, defeating its advantage. If you optimized a chip for ethereum proof-of-work, you would get by definition a CPU - a chip optimized for general-purpose computation.

My guess is that its people who are zealous monocoinists (monocoinism a la monotheism). I don't see Ethereum as a threat to bitcoin, it won't move users off of bitcoin and onto a competitor. Bitcoin has the monopoly on p2p store-of-value, and "bitcoin 2.0" will be a hybrid of bitcoin (as common store-of-value) + next-gen (enabling all varieties of decentralized services). Not something that comes along and replaces bitcoin.
Ethereum with its "DApp store" (distributed app store) and Python-like scripting language, makes easy the creation of blockchain services and complex contracts (gambling and games, reputation systems, decentralized ties to real-world financial instruments). An evolutionary jump in ease-of-use (both by developers and by users) is clearly the way forward.
But bitcoin will continue to play the core role as a standard gateway ramp from conventional mainstream money, payments, and internet business to next-gen p2p decentralized services and protocols.

Those "circuit breaker" policies were there long before the days of electronic trading. They are intended to put a limit on the panic and madness of people, not machines. But it's not really clear if such policies temper or exacerbate people's panic.
When the Knight Capital algos went awry and lost $400 million in a 30 minute period, there was no circuit breaker. Knight was for pushing for the exchanges to roll back their trades, and I think they actually did get a very small amount rolled back. But they were stuck with vast majority of the losses.

That's true. The proof-of-work in the current (proof-of-concept) ethereum alpha clients is basically double sha3, though it also implements GHOST one level deep (meaning miners also get a partial reward for orphaned "uncle" blocks). The alpha clients do execute scripts in the EVM (ethereum virtual machine), charge gas fees, and include those transactions in the next block. But the PoW algo is not robust against an attacker who might just do lots of sha3 and neglect running tx's in the EVM (running tx's in the EVM is what would give ASIC resistance). A robust algo is slated for the mainnet release, iirc they plan to offer a bounty for it.

Eventually, decentralized trading will happen with more complex contracts. Multi-sig is a simple contract. The Ripple ledgers are a type of contract, it matches bid and ask offers to execute trades, so it's an order book implemented as a decentralized protocol (Ripple has its problems, I mention it here only as an example).
What's needed next is a contract which implements a decentralized prediction market (a group at Princeton is [reportedly]( working on this). With a prediction market, it will hopefully be possible to implement coins which track the value of gov-fiat currencies (USD, EUR) - the bitShares concept (though I have more hope for the Princeton guys than bitShares).
Then we can trade between decentralized "bitUSD" and BTC on (decentralized) order books. Exchanges like BitStamp then become mere "gateways" which redeem bitUSD for "real USD" in the form of legacy bank transfers. Rather than centralized websites which hold ungodly sums of customer BTC for trading on internally operated order books.
But it's going to take a few years before we decentralize all the things.

It makes no difference whether you're "locking value" to USD, gold, bacon futures, or litecoins. Obviously, a counter-party needs to take the other side of the trade. The question is why you need to trust that counter-party.
Smart contracts can eliminate counter-party risk, by requiring both parties to deposit collateral before they can enter the contract. Oracles are the final piece, needed to inform the smart contract whether bacon futures went up or down. But even the oracles can also be decentralized, a la SchellingCoin and TruthCoin.

It truly is. All you need for a high market cap is a shitload of worthless coins and high priced coin in a very thin market.
Total "bid sum" would be a better metric. Another good one is "gateway cap" - but only Ripple has it. For example, the ripple USD gateway cap is the total USD people have deposited with ripple gateways - USD in already placed bids or sitting there available to be placed in a bid. The gateway cap changes as people withdraw and redeem currencies to and from ripple at various gateways (eg current bitstamp/USD gateway cap is $1,552,278.12  - that's actual USD bitstamp users are holding as ripple IOUs).

Hmmm.. On a second look, I started to think there might be a mistake in the wording of that ToS paragraph. It says "bids may be matched at higher prices" and "offers may be matched at lower prices". If you read it as "customers' bids" then higher is indeed worse.
But if you read it as "MM's bids" then higher is better for the customer (the customer might sell to the MM for a slightly better price than the best standing bid). I'm sure they mean it as the latter, the MM can only offer a better price (probably only $0.0001 better). The "worse price" interpretation makes no sense.
@_date: 2015-05-09 12:06:00
No, front-running is illegal. What they'd consider is called "preferencing", and has been a pretty standard arrangement since the late 1980's (when it was pioneered by Bernie Madoff).
@_date: 2015-05-09 16:06:24


MMs make money by earning the spread on a round-trip trade, a buy (at $100.00) and a sell (at $100.05), that's $0.05 revenue ($0.04 profit if they paid a penny for the order flow).
The "preferencing" helps them earn that money because they don't have to actually have their limit orders on the book ahead of time in order to match the incoming market orders. If it was an even playing field, they'd have to compete with other MMs by posting better offers and narrowing the spread (which would mean less revenue on the round trip) *before* the market order arrives. Preferencing means they don't have to worry about competing with some other MM (or just a retail trader for that matter) putting better limit orders in front of theirs. They can just put their own limit order up at the very last moment, *after* the market order comes in (that's what i mean by stepping in front).


Even with preferencing, if the NBBO is $100.00/$100.05, then it should fill at $100.05. It'd be illegal for the MM to sell at $100.30. The issue back in the 90's was that the MM's colluded (under Madoff's leadership) to keep the NBBO spread wide by never quoting at odd-eighths. Also, the SEC couldn't track the data, and with prices moving constantly, retail traders were never sure whether they actually got the NBBO price.


I'm saying that you can use a limit order, fine it goes to the exchange. But just because its on the exchange doesn't mean it will get hit. To get filled, other market orders need to arrive. But the MMs are filtering all the market orders, stepping in front before they ever get to the exchange (even market orders from other brokers, they're just getting filtered by different MMs). Your limit order on the exchange will only get filled by toxic market orders that the MMs reject. 


We are, but its the same idea (preferencing / payment for order flow).


Yeah, but when you post a better offer, you have to do it *before* the market order arrives (and everyone else the chance to do the same). Preferencing means the MM can step in *after* the market order arrives. So you could have the best bid on the book, and it could sit there indefinitely. Meanwhile all kinds of market orders are arriving, but they're hitting the MM, not you. They won't hit you until its in the MM's interest to let them hit you.


Yup, when HFT firms pay exchanges big money to colocate, it is just a higher-tech form of the same idea. The top-tier firms actually make most of their money from the retail brokers (eTrade, scottrade, fidelity, etc.), they pay much more for that retail order flow than what it costs to colocate at an exchange (hundreds of millions to buy retail order flow, compared to hundreds of thousands to colocate).


It depends whether you believe all these middle-men are actually adding value and making the market more efficient, or mostly cream-skimming and extracting rents.

No, an unbacked security is a worthless piece of paper, or a certificate with a bunk or defunct issuer. Technically, the issuer backing bitcoins is the group of participants in its decentralized computer network (the bitcoin protocol).
IMO, bitcoin is best classified as a crypto-fiat currency. Fiat is money by declaration, from the latin "let it be done", "it shall be". The issuer backing traditional fiat money is the state/government, so the USD is an example of gov-fiat.

No? In the case of market-makers paying eTrade and AmeriTrade for order flow, they only pay for market orders (a few pennies every so many shares). Limit orders go to the exchange, but they'll sit there waiting for market orders, because the MM bought first rights to the incoming market orders. You won't get filled until the MMs decide to pass it on (and by that time, the price is stale).


Its right there in the OP, pasted from itBit's ToS:


Translation: the MMs, if they want to, can step in front of your standing limit orders.


Other participants who might want to compete as MMs don't have the same preferential access. Its kind of hard to compete when the only market orders that will hit your bids are the ones that are likely to cause adverse selection. The best juice has already been squeezed out, what's left is stuff that the first guy didn't want (its likely to be toxic, the price probably about to move against you).

For issues like this, the advantage of a decentralized trading platform really shines. This is why I like Ripple so much - it brings transparency to the order book, instead of restricting it to the blockchain.
Order books on Ripple have a cryptographic audit trail: we can watch the deposit activity in the same way we can watch bitcoin transactions, since deposits are transactions on the ripple ledger. It would be much more difficult for an exchange/gateway to fudge a ripple order book without getting caught.

On the order flow they pay for, yes ("payment for order flow can be thought of as paid-for preferencing").^1 
The order flow they don't want gets passed on to exchanges (where MM's make up for the lack of preferencing with high-speed co-location, flash orders, and so on).
NYSE specialists did get an advanced look at orders, but they also had a "negative obligation" prohibiting them from trading at a price level where there was already a standing public limit order. But that requirement was dropped when NYSE restructured from a specialist system to designated market-makers. Now DMM's only have the "affirmative obligation" (to buy when there are no standing public limit orders), but neither do they get an advanced look ("DMMs and their algorithms do not receive a “look” at incoming orders. This ensures that an intermediary does not see orders first, and that DMMs compete as a market participant;").^2

The GHOST proposal solves the orphan issue at the root of the Sybil risk he mentioned. It was met with some degree of excitement (around the same time that price was peaking at $1200). But because GHOST wasn't invented by Satoshi (or any of the other core devs), it didn't get much consideration and was pretty much brushed off (a relatively short bitcointalk thread, little mention on the mailing list). It was implemented in Ethereum from day one, but of course most everything Ethereum does is reflexively pooh-poohed.
Bitcoin developers are in a tough spot politically, because if they express interest in or give much study to ideas/proposals already being implemented in other coins (e.g. lower block times), it would be a tacit admission of imperfections in bitcoin and a legitimization of certain alts.

Order-preferencing allows front-running of anybody's limit orders, whether posted by retail buyers or other market-makers. If you're a retail buyer and you post a limit bid at $100, preferencing means its less likely to get filled because the MM can step in front if they want. They'll only step out of the way when the price is falling (not just stepping out of the way, probably even selling into you). Because of the preferencing, anybody else's limit orders are more likely to catch falling knives than to get filled on a bounce.

Sure it does, using GHOST means that there is no additional orphan risk. When two blocks are incompatible, one becomes an uncle and the other becomes the main chain. If somebody is attempting to double spend then you wait a certain number of confirmations.
Sybil attacks that spin up a bunch of nodes are an issue regardless, doing that brings down the "selfish mining" threshold to below 33% (with or without GHOST). But yeah, the bitcoin developers also brushed off the selfish mining attack as well, arguing that miners should rely on trusted "miner backbones" to defend honest pools from such attempts to disrupt block relay / propagation.

There are two ways to grow a money supply of dollars pegged to a gold standard: 1) acquire more gold reserves.  2) revalue the gold price (devalue the currency).
Prices don't adjust quietly because revaluing gold benefits people who own gold, and hurts those who don't. So the US gov chose to defend the gold standard in 1931 (and made it illegal for any non-gov entity to own large amounts), before revaluing gold from $20/oz to $35/oz iirc.

Its not fast block times and future chain scalability that excite me the most. The real breakthrough is the powerful blockchain contract scripting language (this distinguishes DApps from the kind of "smart contracts" run on multi-sig oracles).
Here's an example to demonstrate what it can do for you and why its important. You know how when you bet on Satoshidice (or other "provably-fair" dice games), you get back the winnings either that same block (0-conf) or the next block? "provably-fair" is fine for little dice bets, because if the service decides to keep your coins instead of paying your winnings, they only stole that one dice bet.
But if we want to do a fair lottery pool, it needs to play out over many blocks (everyone can't send their coins into the lottery pool on the exact same block). Nor can we trust any centralized service to operate a lottery pool (it'll be too many coins, way too tempting to steal. totally different from little dice bets). So if we want to have provably-fair no-central-operator trustless lottery pools, it has to be implemented in blockchain contracts (again, no multi-sig oracles, because you'd have to trust them not to collude and not to get hacked). Bitcoin script is too limited for this. Every player's tx needs to be joined together into one [giant transaction]( so it quickly reaches the limit on transaction size around a few hundred players. Not to mention it can't support multiple winners (so no flexibility in the award scheme, like one jackpot and multiple small winners). Bitcoin script just isn't powerful enough.

Replacing Amazon is not the use-case here. Rather, the first immediate use-case that comes to my mind is offering an alternative to state lotteries (and their 30%-50% rake) with a decentralized international lottery (no rake, just 0.0001% tx fees). Second is the dark markets / silk road 5.0's, ones that can't be taken down because they exist entirely on the blockchain (rather than on some single-point-of-failure tor hidden node - who has ever been scammed by those? lol). Also Uber (decentralized Uber would take much less than 20% commish).

From the abstract: "The block generation rate can be securely increased to more than one block per second".


Right, there's no magical silver bullet. There are still issues and challenges remaining ("incentives, mining centralization, etc.", storage space, all already issues with the bitcoin protocol, not new issues particular to GHOST). 


Not related to fast block times? The subtitle is "Fast Money Grows on Trees, Not Chains". GHOST doesn't do much at 10 minute block times, because at 10 minute block times the stale/orphan rate is already insignificant (bitcoin average is ~1.7% according to Decker and Wattenhofer).


From the paper, section 8.1 Basic Properties of GHOST: "Proposition 8.1 (The Convergence of History)". 


Yes, for fast block times. "high rates", from the paper: "We now show that the GHOST chain selection rule is resilient to 50% attacks, even at high rates (in contrast to the longest-chain rule which, as we have shown, deteriorates in such cases)."
Note that GHOST [probably doesn't]( help with the "selfish mining / block withholding" 33% attack. The 33% attack is cited in the paper, and the bitcointalk post mentions it because its a problem that's ultimately caused by some of the network's hashrate going to waste. Using faster block times also causes hash power to go to waste, but that's what GHOST fixes: the orphans you get at fast block times still contribute to the security of the main chain (the heaviest subtree). But GHOST doesn't fix the selfish mining attack (so even at fast block times, the network may still be vulnerable to 33%. "The selfish miners just care about heaviest subtree rather than longest chain").

Because when you signed the smart contract agreeing to snail-mail me X grams, you also deposited coins as collateral into that smart contract. So if you fail to do so (or if I lie and say I never received anything), then our reputations are compared in an immutable public ledger (my history of claims against your history of claims), and amended.
Note that, it is trickier to use smart contracts to mediate off-chain transactions. Its the on-chain applications that are immediately obvious. For example, imagine a lottery operated by a blockchain smart contract. There's no central operator who can steal the pot of money, or collect a rake (assuming they actually pay out instead of stealing the pot). Rather, the risk with a fully decentralized blockchain lottery is miner manipulation of the random number generator (the output of this determines who wins the lottery). But if we can do secure miner-proof RNG, a fully decentralized lottery could grow to a pretty huge prize pool. Remember, there's no house edge, so 99.999% (everything minus tx fees) get paid out in awards. Compare that operate state lotteries, which only pay out 50%-70% of the funds put in (seriously, companies that operate state lotteries keep ~30% of the pot as their revenue, 20% goes to state budget, last 50% goes back to the players. look it up).

What most people don't understand is that Whisper is not a "chat DApp". Its an API for doing off-chain communication, think of it as the underlying infrastructure to set up micropayment channels / off-chain (lightning) transactions.

Right, its a p2p client (bitcoind is even called the "reference client"). In p2p architecture the participants have very fluid roles, technically all participants are equivalent (that's why they're called nodes, instead of clients and servers).

No, you dont trust anyone with your private key (that's the whole point to smart contracts). There is a standard for embedding a script in bitcoin transactions, its called "bitcoin script". All bitcoin transactions use bitcoin script, its just that standard payment transactions only use a few of the available opcodes (particularly OP_EQUALVERIFY and OP_CHECKSIG) to check that a transaction was actually signed by the right private key for the coins its trying to spend.
All bitcoin transactions work by using bitcoin script. Its just that smart contracts use more opcodes. For example, multi-sig tx's use OP_CHECKMULTISIG. Kickstarter-like (Lighthouse) contracts use SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY.
@_date: 2015-02-22 21:15:09


The way I see it, the purpose of smart contracts is to decentralize all the things. Without them, coins just get moved from address to address, from one trusted third-party to another trusted third-party. Its when you have powerful blockchain scripting that you get decentralized services (eg. decentralized exchange, trustless no-central-operator no-house-edge lotteries, etc.). Not just coins moving from your personal wallet to a centralized service to another centralized service.

Bauwens has an [apt response]( "Unfortunately, the argument that one is not educated in economics seems to come from austrian-libertarian economics; and those seem to believe there is only one kind of economics, theirs. For alternative views; see Michael Hudson, Steve Keen, Bernard Lietaer, Margrit Kennedy. MMT, etc … Better yet is a simple course in human history to see the wide variety of rules concerning money and currency; including money with negative interest rates (the longest lasting form); sufficiency based systems (instead of scarcity based). By the way; who is arguing for a unlimited supply of money? I think the question is rather, how the supply should be regulated." 


Well, I was speaking more generally about capitalism there (not Austrian specifically). Market exchange is hierarchical because only those with money can participate. p2p economies are egalitarian because anyone can participate, like the way bitTorrent lets anyone with an internet connection access movies. Some aspects of bitcoin are still egalitarian (anyone can see the blockchain). And its money supply distribution was at least initially egalitarian (when anyone with a CPU could mine).


I was fairly early myself, I identified as an anarchist since I was old enough to be political (it was the late 90's when I first read Tim May's Crypto Anarchist Manifesto). But I was also anti-capitalist, so leaned away from anarcho-capitalism and toward anarcho-syndicalism (ie. anarchist/activist in the Noam Chomsky tradition, more socialist than libertarian).


You sound like one of those who "seem to believe there is only one kind of economics, theirs." I will admit I haven't read a ton from authors in the Austrian school. There is apparently a new book by Jeffrey Tucker that turns up if you search austrian + p2p, and I look forward to reading that. Among the relatively few other results, here's another [excerpt from Bauwens]( who I strongly agree with:
"This period also sees the emergence of the global reserve currency like Bitcoin, which frankly aims to create a global counter-power both the classic global financial system and to state-base currencies. Bitcoin is extremely important as a signpost since it is the first global ‘post-Westphalian’ currency, based on ‘social sovereignty’, and it shows that alternative currencies can scale and can exist as a workable alternative. At the same time, the anarcho-capitalist design of the currency based on Austrian economics, in many ways exacerbates the characteristics of the neoliberal era. As a shadow commodity currency, while useful as a reserve currency that can exist outside of the control of nation-states, it also exacerbates the very social inequalities that are so characteristic of financial capitalism. It offers no fundamental solution to the value crisis affecting the global system of cognitive capitalism but is a very interesting transitional monetary system that acts as signpost for the future. Rather than as an end, we see Bitcoin as the beginning of an evolution towards multiple cryptocurrencies, some of which that will integrate different social values in their protocols."
Besides Bauwens, I also side with the anarchist anthropologist David Graeber. I find the arguments in his book (Debt: The First 5000 Years) very persuasive, which cites Mises's "Theory of Money and Credit" quite a bit and actually says a lot of positive things about it iirc. For something shorter you might read this [debate of his with Robert Murphy](


[here you go]( "Libertarians often hold the 19th century up as a sort of model for what the present should be. Unlike extremist left-wing ideologies, like Communism, libertarianism is backward rather than forward-looking. Where Communism projects into the future a mythic ideal, libertarianism mourns over an ideal past that has supposedly been lost."

So its better to have fewer miners than more miners? And the concern about mining pools colluding with ASIC manufacturers is misplaced fear?


Let me restate, nobody pays a fee *which is earned by nodes* for uploading and sharing old blocks.


Okay, now we are getting down to the nitty-gritty. I have to quote Bauwens yet again: "P2P is often described as a 'gift economy' (see Richard Barbrook for an example). However, it is our contention that this is somewhat misleading. The key reason is that peer to peer is not a form of equality matching; it is not based on reciprocity. P2P follows the adage: each contributes according to his capacities and willingness, and each takes according to his needs. There is no obligatory reciprocity involved. In the pure forms of peer production, producers are not paid. Thus, if there is 'gifting' it is entirely non-reciprocal gifting, the use of peer-produced use-value does not create a contrary obligation." [source](
They key distinction here is to recognize the difference between p2p economy and market economy. P2P economies "produce use-value through the free cooperation of producers who have access to distributed capital: this is the P2P production mode, a 'third mode of production' different from for-profit or public production by state-owned enterprises. Its product is not exchange value for a market, but use-value for a community of users."


Because I find that p2p theory (as described by Bauwens) has much greater explanatory power than Austrian rationale. What's the Austrian answer as to why nodes upload the blockchain (even if they don't earn a fee for doing so)? What gift do they receive in return?


funny, I think that's what you (and justusranvier) are doing. Twisting clients and servers (even though thats a false dichotomy of p2p architecture) into consumers and suppliers, and miner centralization into "specialization / division of labor".


That's not [how it worked]( Sending money to an ip address just queried the recipient node for a new pubkey address, then the client would send a tx to that address as normal. Tx fees were always optional for any transaction.


Those are ports of the same code to different programming languages! Of course they behave the same. They all have to implement the exact same protocol in order to be compatible. The only thing different on mining nodes is that they run a very small subroutine (sha256 hashing) on special hardware.


I'm not the one being dogmatic here. There is overlap and interplay between P2P economy and market economy (I'll spare you another Bauwens quote on that point). If we're talking about network architecture (ie. technical/protocol distinction rather than economic) then I'd argue it is more clear-cut: bitcoin is a p2p protocol, NOT a client-server protocol.


I'm not arguing with you personally. I'm just trying to explain (for any reader) why I think the Austrian economic worldview is not the end-all be-all interpretation of socio-economic interaction. P2P theory offers (imho) a more modern perspective (post-scarcity framework for immaterial/digital-information goods) and more explanatory power.

No, it doesn't specify how to create a smart contract for this specific case. But they're good example cases to help understand how you might implement for other cases.
This specific case may or not be simple enough to implement in bitcoin script. I'm not sure, what do you think?
@_date: 2015-03-21 01:35:33
Ethereum doesn't have a weak consensus, at least not for version 1.0 which will be proof-of-work (i'm still skeptical of proof-of-stake personally). There's no reason sha3 PoW, or hashimoto-dagger PoW, or litecoin's scrypt PoW, or any kind of PoW is a weaker consensus mechanism than bitcoin's sha256. The only difference is the issue of specialized hardware, mining pools, centralization, total hash rate, and so on. But fundamentally they're all essentially similar.
Implementation bugs in the PoW algo aren't even really an issue, its the other parts of the code that are a much bigger concern when it comes to how solid the consensus is (eg. bitcoin's 0.7.2/0.8 hard fork was not caused by bugs in the PoW algo, it was caused by a mistake in the settings for the BDB block index database).
Issues of the EVM (ethereum virtual machine) are a valid concern. Having a powerful (quasi-turing-complete) scripting language is a security risk, no doubt about it. But just because a new thing might be a security risk is not a reason that it shouldn't be tried. It just means you don't want to risk $1 billion in value trying it. Instead, only risk what you can afford to lose, and do everything in your power to make sure there are no bugs or vulnerabilities in the implementation as time goes on (exactly what bitcoin did - and there are probably still bugs and undiscovered vulnerabilities in bitcoin).

The word "cartel" does not appear once within the links of your part 1 article (neither the wiki nor the DiLorenzo article). The argument I'm making is quite different from the "natural monopoly" argument used by governments to justify granting monopolies in certain markets. The DiLorenzo article doesn't really support your point; it only argues against government-granted monopolies (particularly public utilities), it doesn't say that oligopolies/cartels/monopolies would never emerge in a market free from any government regulation.
It might help if you distinguish p2p economy from "command economy" (rather than equate the two). Bauwens does this:


It is true that currently nodes are not incentivized to relay transactions, and as the Bitcoin and Red Balloons paper pointed out, that is a problem. You cannot, however, equate p2p economy with "command economy"; economic paradigms (in the 21st century) do not boil down to command vs capitalism!
Okay then, how to incentivize relaying of transactions? The Red Balloons paper argues that relaying tx's should somehow be factored into the block reward. But you're arguing that participants should "pay each other" for relaying tx's, while determination of the block reward should (for some reason) be exempt from the whims of the market.

Initially, all bitcoin did was send around useless tokens. Ethereum is a newborn baby. And initially, the target audience is developers, not users. In the short-term, it might seem better to build a feature or service and just target users. But in the long run, its advantageous to build a platform which makes building new features much easier.
The complexity of what Ethereum is trying to accomplish is more comparable to Blockstream. Does Blockstream have anything for users yet? Is it fair to fault them for that? Or anything for developers? I check Blockstream's github about once a month. Still waiting...


Neat, I'd like to see some documentation on that (more than stubs for the ScriptBuilder class). The point of the Solidity ABI is that its a way to provide much cleaner DSL's and API's to the contracts. Before Solidity (which is only Gav's 2nd language, no red flags there), you had to manually pack the data and send them to contracts as transaction arguments. Ethereum aren't the only ones who think powerful scripting for contracts is the way to go. Counterparty started out specifying protocol features as API's. They scrapped it and decided to just support EVM bytecode.


I agree, for one DApp its a waste. That's why I think OpenBazaar is going about it the wrong way, they want to maintain a whole p2p stack just for one DApp. A shared stack (ie. a platform) would solve the same problems for a whole variety of Dapps.


Well, you never give the site your password. Its granular access control, so each transaction would pop up a request to send X coins. There are security challenges here for sure, users will need to be very careful with unaudited DApps. But for UI/UX I think it makes sense, I compare it to iOS in-app purchases which pop up a password request to spend $x dollars. Users don't want to have to pull out their wallet and type in their credit card every time they spend or send money. The UX flow with bitcoin services makes them do that - open a wallet, copy/paste addresses, etc. It doesn't have to though (it can be seamless within a "DApp store" / platform).


True, it was provably-fair and for (small) dice rolls not much risk. But for other games a central operator is a huge risk, lotteries for example. Its unlikely that a lottery pool could grow huge unless its fully trustless. Nobody wants to trust a central operator over an extended period of blocks with much money (regardless of an audit trail). And on the flip side no central operator wants the regulatory risk (since I connect from a U.S. ip, SatoshiDice blocks me from their service).


Compared to the Ethereum docs, the curiosity-driven article about bitcoin script is not very helpful. It shows how to do a decentralized lottery for three players. I want to do a lottery for 10,000 players. And I want my front-end in html/js, so how do I do my api hooks? Ethereum tells me how to do all that (including whisper for a chat lobby).

And its precisely this centralization-of-mining trend which threatens the p2p-ness of bitcoin.


Nobody pays a fee to download the blockchain. And there's no fee to query other nodes about their blocks. Many aspects of bitcoin are based on p2p exchange, not market exchange.


I don't see how its relevant whether you send money to an IP address or to a public key. There is a p2p economy around all aspects of the protocol - relaying tx's, broadcasting blocks, staying connected to other nodes, etc. These are similar to the p2p economics of bitTorrent - the protocol does not prescribe monetary exchanges for nodes to connect and query each other.


Baloney. The code for p2p clients is symmetric for all nodes. Even light clients do the exact same kind of block verifications as miners (they just do them on fewer blocks).
@_date: 2015-02-23 15:17:45


And it should be judged as such, rather than being resented for having the luxury of a clean slate design. Nobody looks at a newborn baby and says "there's no way this tiny creature could ever accomplish anything" [useful or interesting] (to paraphrase pg).


Right. And Ethereum's limitation (gas fees) make it much simpler to scale beyond 684 pledges. No changes necessary to its core protocol.


That's why I said "difficult to build." Ethereum's ["web 3.0" architecture]( simplifies such issues considerably. Without a platform for Dapps, each one needs to resolve a bunch of the same problems (Lighthouse, OpenBazaar, etc.).


I was mainly referring to the way a serverless project file must be passed around. Ethereum avoids that because it doesn't need to assemble a single 684-input mega-transaction. There are other aspects too that will be less cumbersome, eg. the wallet is seamless with Dapps (not just with one dapp but with every Dapp) and their front-ends.
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:32:16


I see Ethereum as a sort of Heroku-for-DApps (or meteor.js [for dapps]( or firebase for dapps). What Heroku does is ease development of web apps made with client-server web frameworks, and deployment to AWS instances. What ethereum does is ease development of DApps made with blockchain contracts and html/js front-ends, and deployment of the backend to the blockchain and the front-end to a contrent-addressable/merkle-dag p2p filesharing network.


You're not alone there. It seems their policy is to not do project management. They explicitly hire people who "don't need to be managed." My biggest concern is Not-Invented-Here syndrome (rolling their own whisper and swarm instead of adopting, say, bitmessage and ipfs). But as long as something gets rolled out, and it works, I'm satisfied. It doesn't even need to be on time, delays are inevitable.
Could their development process be improved? Absolutely. But despite an imperfect process, they're still making good progress.


That it's hard to do complex things in an assembly-like language that can't store state is the biggest reason I think. Also, most developers are web developers stuck in a client-server mindset. To them a server-less p2p DApp sounds like a "horseless carriage" (and until users understand what blockchain contracts can do, we can't blame them if they only ask for faster horses). Plus, making a native UI is hard for web developers, and most don't want to make users download a native app (they'd have to in order to use non-http p2p libraries and such). On top of that, it's easy to monetize a client-server web service that just has the users deposit their coins into a server-side wallet. All that together means we mostly see two things: a bunch of centralized web services, and a bunch of alt-coins that don't really do much (because it's hard to implement features in a fork of bitcoin).
If it comes down to difficulty, then we should do our best to make it easy, like we do in any other domain of software development. Not just naysay because "complexity" (complexity can be managed, that's what software engineers are supposed to do). But if it comes to down people hardly caring about blockchain scripts and smart contracts and p2p architecture, then Ethereum will fizzle out and bitcoin's primary use will continue to be as a payment method between centralized services (perhaps with some oracle services on the periphery).


I don't want to build a whole p2p network. I want to build a DApp on top of an existing p2p network. TomP2P is a DHT library, Dapps built with TomP2P each form their own separate DHT. Dapps built on a shared platform would all share the same DHT.


Another group heading towards full p2p architecture is BitTorrent Inc's Project Maelstrom (I should have mentioned it before with IPFS). Maelstrom is a web-browser-like-thing, it's a fork of Chromium actually. You can put a magnet URL in the address bar, and if the torrent contains an index.html with js files, it will seamlessly render. This is very similar to the vision for Mist (which also utilizes Chromium through QtWebEngine), but Mist provides js hooks into blockchain contracts and transactions. Its actually only one new blockchain/currency (the Ethereum 2.0 multi-chain stuff is a separate research effort). As a developer, I don't want yet another set of traditional libraries. Integrating libraries is hard, I want ethereum (or somebody) to do it for me and then show me the way in the form of a unified API.


I share that worry. But I worry that even more people will be disappointed if the sidechain vision doesn't materialize and boost BTC back toward the moon. I wouldn't say that Ethereum's marketing is any less hype-filled than Blockstream's in that regard.


Fair enough. What I have in mind is more the use of various services rather than simple payments. I have umpteen different wallets/accounts at different exchanges, betting games, prediction markets, marketplaces, etc. But if they were DApps then my funds at each service would be deposits in contracts (rather than deposits to some server-side wallet under their control), and there would be basically one wallet that could seamlessly move funds between DApps, depositing to and more importantly withdrawing from any DApp/service.

How about responding to the question instead of evading it?


Obviously client-server architectures also do an "upload-download thing" (fyi in the conventional model its generally the server who does the uploading, not the client). These (centralized) client-server architectures usually have a profit model that depends maintaining control of the platform to do things like skim commission, charge subscriptions, and/or inject advertisements. Bauwens calls them [netarchists](


Justusranvier's article is a shameless attempt at imposing a Capitalist-exchange worldview on every protocol interaction between nodes in a p2p network.


Economics is a social science! One for which the empirical reality of information/digital economies (particularly of the p2p type) is very challenging to capitalist and scarcity-based economic frameworks.


How are wikipedia contributions (the archetypal example of p2p contributions) market transactions? This question is relevant because the bitcoin blockchain is a p2p commons similar to wikipedia - it gains value from being freely and widely distributed.


No they aren't, because market exchanges only benefit the individuals participating in that exchange (ie. exchange-value for the individuals). p2p economy generates use-value for the collective network (ie. use-value to the commons).


That is your opinion. Personally, I would rather be neo-Marxist than neo-liberal capitalist. And fyi Bauwens is all over p2pfoundation.org - the same forum where Satoshi made his "I am not Dorian Nakamoto" statement. He didn't come back to life to post in the Libertarian Super-Capitalist blogosphere. So I think you are on very thin ice projecting such confidence about the ideals of bitcoin/p2p design with appeals to fringe authority.


It explains why bitcoin nodes upload the blockchain for free: because doing so adds use-value to the p2p commons. Trying to call that a gift/reciprocity trade raises more questions than it answers. ("upload/download thing also happens in non-p2p networks" - but such non-p2p networks are centralized services with conventional profit mechanisms!)


Coulda fooled me. I'm acting in good faith here, and trying to be very clear about [my philosophical stance]( p2p-anarchist rather than anarcho-capitalist. If you wanted to have an honest discussion you would do the same.


No, that was a confusion of your own deriving from some contradictory premises and faulty logic.


I don't hate markets. I myself am working on software for the express purpose of enabling more efficient (decentralized) markets. I just don't believe that markets are the right solution/incentive to every problem. In some cases, p2p/commons are a better solution (you might take a look at [ for such a case).

Well, I'm not an expert on bitcoin script but I'll take a guess. Maybe side A is one p2sh address, side B is another p2sh address, and both scripts specify as outputs a third p2sh address that's a sort of 1-of-2 multi-sig address where each charity holds one of the two privkeys. Its not multi-sig exactly, because the additional restrictions are nLockTime, and for charity A to claim the funds, the inputs to the side A p2sh need to be greater than the inputs to side B p2sh.
That's just a guess. Let me know if you find out from someone more knowledgeable whether or not that works.

Thanks for the dialogue!


The script compilers have gone through numerous iterations, [here's the latest]( The blockchain works, the contracts work, the [contract -&gt; js api hooks]( work. Already, it does a lot.
In comparison, the best effort I've seen to make bitcoin script easy to use is [this](


That's why I linked to an architecture diagram. Its more than a buzzword.


I can understand that, its the reason I ignored ethereum when the white paper came out. I continue to ignore white papers. But by now, they have a track record of taking things from [concept to alpha](
Whether they can take it from alpha to stable beta with many users is another question. To be skeptical about that is fair, but to deny that a working alpha exists is not.


Well, p2p clients do need to be around. [Whisper]( is a working alpha. For files, [IPFS]( is farther along than ethereum's swarm (some have been pushing for ethereum to adopt ipfs as swarm, instead of building their own). It would have been encouraging to see a more enthusiastic response to ipfs [from r/bitcoin](
IPFS is one of the few projects (other than ethereum) that understands the advantage to a fully p2p [architecture]( The dominant architecture for bitcoin services is plain client-server, just with the server running a p2p daemon. That's why we see so many fly-by-night bitcoin services losing or stealing users' coins. We can and should do better.


Actually, no it wouldn't be easy to convert to a server-side app. Its running in a headless ethereum client; the client is required to manage the wallet, sign tx's, provide the js api to the contracts, etc. The web server is github pages, strictly as a static file server. The js api is [localhost json-rpc]( the front-end code (and back-end code for that matter) should run the same in Mist or AZ.
SatoshiDice was a centralized service with a central operator - users had to trust that the SatoshiDice node would send back their coins from the satoshiDice wallet if they won. Sleth/ethereum-slots is a fully trustless blockchain contract.

[Here's something]( It might be possible to do in bitcoin script, but how easy would it be? Is it not useful to make it easy to do things? Or just not interesting?
@_date: 2015-02-09 18:42:39
The reason its called peer to peer is because there's no market hierarchy of "consumers" and "suppliers" (or clients and servers). If relaying tx's becomes a market economy (rather than a p2p economy), the "suppliers" (ie. relay nodes) might attempt form some kind of cartel and restrict the supply so they can extort fees from users.
Markets (or at least buy-sell markets) are not the solution for every problem. There is a wide spectrum of possible mechanisms and incentives. A good place to start reading about them might be [The Political Economy of Peer Production]( by Michel Bauwens. Theory around p2p economy is so much more insightful than the old and tired arguments from Austrian-econ Libertarian types. Indeed, the brilliance of the block reward is that it used a incentive-compatible p2p mechanism to enable what the "market principles" of a pompous professor never could.
Now, the issue about incentives to relay transactions was already discussed in the 2012 paper [Bitcoin and Red Balloons]( It might be helpful to skim the prior research before rushing out to propose markets as the hammer for every nail in sight.

A contract could just look at which address received the most coins when the contest ends. Then forward the funds to the address marked for the winner. There would be no trusted third parties involved (the charity is not a trusted third party in the contract. its just an address that receives the donations).

[Here's another]( I chose the slots game first because it includes screenshots.
The point is that its very easy to create decentralized apps using ethereum script (compared to bitcoin script). Resistance to acknowledge this is manifesting as a series of excuses: "this won't work", "this shouldn't be done on the blockchain, better to be centralized", "well, smart contracts aren't actually *that* useful, nor interesting", "technically, it is possible to do this in bitcoin script (a real man would write it in asm). so that other platform is just marketing hype."
Its a lesson in group psychology. Really quite laughable.. It'd be much more prudent for the btc maximalists to just say "okay we admit that smart contracts are interesting and powerful scripting is useful. We want to bring them to bitcoin through sidechains."
The reason smart contracts aren't talked about a lot is because Bitcoin isn't the ideal platform for them (most of the past month's r/bitcoin results for "smart contracts" are about Ethereum). At least Nick Szabo [can admit that](
@_date: 2015-02-22 21:02:08
Smart contracts are decentralized; if you send coins to a smart contract, the coins will move according to the logic programmed into the script. So there's no centralized maintainer of the smart contract who can steal that money (because the smart contract is a decentralized pay-2-script-hash which is "hosted" on the blockchain).
API's are centralized. If you send money to a blockchain address which triggers some hook to a centralized API, those coins are controlled by whoever owns that address (because presumably its a regular bitcoin address - not a p2sh address or a true smart contract). A lot of companies are trying to call their centralized API's "smart contracts". Don't be fooled.

No, Ripple Labs can't change the network on a whim. The software is open-source and validator nodes (such as Bitstamp) are independent. A majority of the nodes would have to upgrade to new software if Ripple Labs wanted to change the protocol, or there would be a fork of the ledger. Its just like saying that the bitcoin protocol could change at the whim of the Bitcoin Foundation and core devs.
It is true that OpenCoin/Ripple Labs started with ownership of 100% of the coins. In that respect, they are no worse than MasterCoin. But calling it a "pre-mine" makes no sense - using consensus instead of proof-of-work (mining) is what enables new ledgers/blocks in seconds instead of minutes. And rather than transaction fees going to miners, they are destroyed, so supply decreases and tx fees benefit all XRP holders instead of just miners.
Take off your blinders. Bitcoin is the gold standard for store-of-value, but there is a major need of some way, besides bank transfers, to transfer gov-fiat between exchanges. Ripple does that.

Did Austrians take up the cause of bitcoin because Satoshi designed the blockchain to be anti-inflationary (with his comment in the first block opposed to inflationary banking)? Why did Satoshi make his "I am not Dorian" statement on p2pfoundation.org? I dont think that choice of venue was convenience..  
Austrian / Libertarians tend to have a simplistic (or at least outdated) view of the world when there only existed the State (ie. the public/government) and the "private" (ie. companies and corporations). They are attempting to coopt bitcoin as not just anti-state (which it obviously is) but also as a pro-private pro-"free market" project. That was actually the original intent of Paypal and Peter Thiel's libertarian vision. The reason bitcoin succeeded over paypal (in being state-resistant) is because it is peer-2-peer, and that's a design of political economy not just technical network architecture.
If you apply Austrian theory strictly and literally (about scarcity etc etc) and take justusranvier's arguments to their logical extreme, then who would upload the bitcoin blockchain for free? It is only rational to upload the 20gb+ bitcoin blockchain for free in a p2p economy, because it is only by freely and widely distributing the blockchain that it gains value for all of its users (not just for one tx).

Powerful blockchain scripting, for starters. Multi-sig is not even enough to do decentralized lottery. Take a look at how to do a [lottery in bitcoin script]( Then realize that's only for three players. Take a look at lighthouse - decentralized kickstarter in bitcoin script. It was difficult to build, and remains cumbersome to use. Doing either of these is trivial on Ethereum (or at least will be, when its a stable platform. hopefully soon).
That's not to say that bitcoin will go by the wayside. It could stay dominant through sidechains, imho.

Ripple also incorporates the bitcoin community. And FYI it is not plateauing, XRP price bottomed at 400 to the dollar not long ago, and quickly bounced back to 75. A lot of funds moved in during that bounce (probably not as much as went to MasterCoin though).

I also read the MasterCoin marketing paper (calling it a whitepaper would be an insult to the bitcoin whitepaper, which was actually full of technical detail). I also agree that the biggest problem was the "escrow fund" - seems like the core concept but its little more than magical hand-wavery.
I don't think that every alt-coin is a scam, but most are. Some are just toys. MasterCoin is promising way more than it can deliver. I'm very pessimistic that they can build a piece of software by paying bounties, especially when there's so little design/spec at the outset.

Part of the reason is that the total coin supply of XRP is much larger than the alts. Current XRP float is about 7 billion, alt-coin float/supply usually numbers between ten-million and hundred-million.

Ripple. Its the only crypto-currency which facilitates fiat withdrawals/transfers. That makes it the most useful to exchanges running into bureaucracy problems with bank transfers, and is therefore most likely to be adopted.
The XRP fees-destroyed (deflationary) scheme is comparable to peercoin's proof-of-stake (inflationary) scheme. Rather than fees getting paid to miners, they are effectively paid to all XRP holders, in proportion to their holdings.
Ultra-fast blocks (5-10 seconds), no mining/hardware expenses, backed by a for-profit company. It is light-years ahead of the competition (colored coins, masterCoin, etc), and uniquely complementary. Its in a class of its own, and is the only crypto-coin different enough to have a de-correlated price. As a very recent sign, now USD/XRP actually has more liquidity than BTC/XRP (while the alt-chains are still almost entirely traded against BTC and therefore highly correlated).

You're absolutely right that Mastercoin proposes "magical fairies" to track prices. They call it an "Escrow fund", which will supposedly automagically regulate the supply to keep prices pegged.

Look, "centralized" means there's a central authority - some administrator that can freeze your account balance and change it at will. That's how paypal works - your account is under their control and they can freeze your funds. If you forget your password, you can call them and they'll reset it.
XRP has no central authority - it is a decentralized crypto-currency. Ripple corp cannot freeze your funds. If you forget your wallet password, there is nothing they can do - they do not keep a copy of your private keys.
It is fair to point out that BTC is distributed to miners while XRP is not - that is absolutely true. But it is *not* "centralized and regulated" any more than a bitcoin exchange - saying otherwise is total nonsense.

When BTC falls, LTC falls even more. LTC is entirely priced against BTC as almost all liquidity for LTC is in BTC. If/when BTC falls, people see their LTC at 0.20 LTC/BTC is falling along with it. So they dump the LTC too, and it falls from 0.20 to even lower, and is falling even faster than BTC. Look at the price history, LTC doesn't support BTC price and its not a place where money gets "parked". Its price is nearly 100% correlated, just more volatile (like silver to gold).

Tier-1 verification is available in all states, but can only trade virtual currencies (so no BTC/USD or BTC/EUR. only BTC/LTC  BTC/XRP etc). Tier-2 verification (to trade USD and EUR) is available on a state-by-state basis.
Its because they are following the law down to the letter. Coinbase is actually in murky waters, because they take the liberty of operating in all states with only a national registration with FinCen. But Money Services Business (MSB) is a state by state license (with up to million dollar bonds required for each state). Kraken won't start operating in a state unless they are MSB registered in that state.
The one state confirmed to already be supported is South Carolina. They suggest that U.S. users who really want to trade USD register an LLC in south carolina, and sign up under the LLC.

XRP price is definitely affected by Ripple Labs wholesaling and giveaways. Just like any alt-coin price is going to be affected by whether early miners are dumping or hoarding.
But much more important to XRP price is the ripple gateway cap. You don't know what the fiat deposits are on conventional bitcoin exchanges. But you can see that on ripple gateways, even before it hits the ripple order books. More fiat deposited at ripple gateways, leads to a higher XRP price. Just like more money at bitcoin exchanges (though you can't see it until it hits the order book), leads to a higher BTC price.

No, if BTC/USD doubles instantly, PPC/BTC is still at 0.008. The only way PPC/BTC goes down to 0.004 is if there's a dump of PPC.
when BTC is rising, PPC/BTC stays at 0.008 or goes even higher because there's no reason to dump alt-coins when BTC is rising. The alt-coin trading liquidity is all in BTC, so PPC is going to rise right along with BTC.
The problem is when BTC is falling. When BTC is falling, and there's a PPC/BTC rate at 0.008, then the PPC/USD price is falling at the same rate as the BTC/USD price. So falling BTC causes people to stop the pain, and dump their PPC. But since all the PPC trading liquidity is between BTC (and not PPC/USD), that pushes down the PPC/BTC price, so the alt-coin is falling against the USD even faster than BTC is. alt-coins are highly correlated to BTC price, because all the liquidity is against BTC. But there's way less liquidity in PPC/BTC than BTC/USD, so PPC is way more volatile.
Same way that silver price is correlated to gold, just more volatile. Silver is NOT a hedge for gold, its just a riskier bet in the same direction.
