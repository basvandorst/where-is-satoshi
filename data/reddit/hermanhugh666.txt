I would be skeptical about it
@_date: 2019-10-03 22:19:38
No I mean I think investing in large caps is for fools now apparently
@_date: 2019-10-06 02:31:14
It is real

When fiat currencies collapse people start trading goods and services with currencies that hold their value. Look back anywhere in history and you can see this. Shit, look at Venezuela right now. $1,000 worth in Silver would buy you a years worth of food. Just because you have been trading goods and services with fiat currency your whole life does not mean that you are right. Constant printing of currency and the Federal Reserve will collapse this system. SET THE WHOLE THING ON FIRE!

You're funny

This exact article is getting pushed by fake accounts or just the theory that the Yellow Vest movement is taking money out?: 
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:28:11
Go long gold, silver and selected cyrptos and you will do just fine. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:34:46
Banks close and people will lose faith in the entire banking system. It is a dominion effect. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:48:28
Stock up on your guns and gold fellas
@_date: 2019-01-10 00:09:50
Whole economic system is collapsing...just wait
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:23:30
It will happen. 70% of the people are in the Yellow Vest Movement. Be ready for a currency collapse. I would envy those who are long a decentralized currency. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:34:22
Once the bank sets a daily withdraw limit then the whole currency will be under fire from institutional investors. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:27:46
Start the movement. Get out of this crappy fiat currency that will economically implode the country
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:40:02
What is the long term goal of the French government?
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:56:23
I think it is 70% of the population. They have brought change already and will continue to bring change. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:48:00
Agree. Those yellow yest folks are determined to take the country down. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 18:24:57
sounds like you are triggered my good friend.
@_date: 2019-01-10 00:10:05
No it won/
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:23:51
They will go through with it. What do you think the probability is? Higher than 50% IMO. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 17:33:08
Sounds like a French Government supporter here. Long decentralized currencies. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 15:22:07
Be ready for a total global revolution. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 18:34:22
Typically I hate the French, but in this case I love them. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 18:33:13
haha Trump is our orange vest guy
@_date: 2019-01-09 15:13:53
This political "shit" will rock the entire banking system in France. This will lead to other working class individuals around the world to pull money out of banks and put into decentralized currencies such as bitcoin. Be supportive of the movement!
@_date: 2019-01-12 04:11:20
I’m bullish too 
@_date: 2019-01-08 17:49:32
The collapse of a fiat currency will not eliminate poverty, it will just be a huge wealth transfer. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:39:05
How would you promote a run on teh banks?
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:39:29
Exactly, fuck Macron and his global elitist followers.
@_date: 2019-01-10 00:09:59
Says who?
@_date: 2019-01-09 02:49:18
The masterpiece boobs pop up is great and made me lol 
@_date: 2019-01-08 23:26:07
So now this website posts an article saying they are going to "stab a bum"?!?! What kind of news source is this? IS THIS A JOKE?
@_date: 2019-01-08 18:33:48
What does astro-turfing mean? 
@_date: 2019-01-09 14:45:16
This is a desperate move by the French Government. If there is a true run on the bank the entire French economic system will be overhauled.
