If you do, make an encrypted DMG file and you can store that in your DB folder.

Fucking seriously.

Exactly what I came here to say. Oh he feels bad for Western Union, an outdated financial giant that rips everyone off and does absolutely no good with the shitloads of money it makes, and he is upset at Redditors for "not growing up". K bye! Or...... Fuck outta here.... 
@_date: 2014-07-16 17:14:16
Thank you
@_date: 2014-09-09 21:04:10
I'm in if it hits 3000!
@_date: 2014-11-26 21:43:12
never heard of them. been on reddit for years. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 12:14:40
Makes sense. But it would be quickly absorbed by the vast market and the price would always re stabilize itself. That's what I think anyways. But you make a good point. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 08:47:33
That, my friend, is the right question. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 05:17:52
It sure did.

This is a very interesting topic for discussion. Let's keep it going. Wouldn't it be dangerous for one party or group to have enormous shares of the bitcoin pie? What threat could this pose to the rest of the users? Couldn't the market be manipulated then and they could eventually own most of the coins?

I know this question seems ridiculous and you will WANT TO DOWNVOTE IT, but please don't, upvote it instead.  Lots of people are clueless and legitimately have these questions.   They need to see the thread and read the comments and have their questions answered. This subreddit needs to be nicer to people who don't know as much as some of us do.
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:09:49
they make them? I don't get it. The actual US coins? I thought the Federal Reserve was in charge of printing money including coins. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 03:36:21
This is great. The only thing is, "Director of the US Mint" sounds like it's way more important that it actually is. What the fuck is "US Mint"? Seems to be just a site that sells coins. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 10:34:34
Send = sent. Thanks, awesome idea. Although I don't have an android.
@_date: 2014-07-22 05:46:56
Dear i love all of you smart motherfuckers.
@_date: 2014-07-16 06:11:47
haha! I mean, knowing that the Fed is in charge of all the money, "US Mint" sounds like some poser organization. Still, it doesn't seem to be that important in terms of making significant decisions.
@_date: 2014-08-27 17:18:26
dude, for this too, but for many other reasons as well: FUCK PAYPAL.
@_date: 2014-07-21 06:48:01
Great point
@_date: 2014-07-22 11:57:23
Deflation? How is that bad?
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:52:51
What kind of relationship do they have with the Fed? I thought they are in charge of money. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 21:20:19
Does it run on some engine? or did you develop the site from scratch? rails?
@_date: 2014-08-09 00:01:06
@_date: 2014-09-18 21:59:47
legitimate question. fuck the downvoter.
@_date: 2014-01-24 21:21:30
 I was only able to find a Mt.Gox one. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:55:07
I give a fuck, because it encourages more idiots to pour their savings into it. I'm not saying it's bad, but Bitcoin isn't a get-rich investment. We shouldn't give a fuck about its *dollar* equivalent. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 16:43:08
Yeah i do still go around advocating Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 06:40:52
i wanna buy that shirt

When asked about one problem he wish we could solve in 2016 -- Rand said getting people to "Register to vote." Can we start a discussion on how the Block Chain technology can revolutionize voting?
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:01:48
Everybody just calm the fuck down and let time pass. This is retarded. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:30:59
Great example. It would indeed be that. 
[$999,999,999,999] created out of high quality paper and ink 
[$32,000] x 500 employee salary
[$3] - Onions, 2.6 lbs]

No, he gave you 100 mBTC's (milliBits)!
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:05:31
I'm starting to think there are people out there spending lots of money trying to manipulate us. Don't be gullible, be patient, and just fucking relax everybody. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:26:23
Regardless of who the fuck made it, I love it. Fuck the downvoters
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:30:15
Hahahaha love this. Correction followed by correction of correction. Yo dawg
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:17:27
That's crazy. I bet most people wouldn't give it back. That makes you pretty special. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:20:22
the attitude makes him right?
