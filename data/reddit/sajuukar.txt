No, he said he LOST it.

Well... unanimous among 51%.

I loved wormy.  He was really enthusiastic about the subject matter and improved my own outlook as a result.  THANKS wormy!

DO IT.

.01 BTC is officially an internet? That is so funny and awesome and cool!
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:53:45
YES I have now decided that mBTC will be known as bitties.  
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:54:47
I would get one of these if it was actually somewhat smaller- any plans for smaller, perhaps less expensive versions?  Say, closer to 12"?
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:17:15
This is already so cool, but it would be even more awesome if there was some sort of summary somewhere... perhaps a dedicated exchange-rate and/or total volume line... just thinking out loud :)

If people are still using both 0.8 and 0.7, doesn't this mean that the problem could just as easily happen again?  What is different this time?

One of the biggest strengths of bitcoin is its decentralized nature, and as is evidenced by this informational lock-out (I have felt it myself, as well), too much knowledge was centralized in that forum.    
  
Perhaps this will cause an informational diaspora, of sorts.

Just run an ethernet cable through a wormhole.

Or maybe staticky electronic sounds like in the matrix.

I'm still not entirely sure if we should be pronouncing it millibits (which actually came somewhat naturally to me when discussing it out loud) or mills, millicoins, millibitcoins, thousandths-of-a-bitcoin (what a mouthful!), or what.  Em-bee-tee-see?
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:26:48
Try Bitcoinium.

I just received mine today, thanks Silfax!  Just waiting on the load-up now...
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:44:07
Silfax is indeed reputable- I too have participated in one of his group buys for Casascius coins.  
@_date: 2013-02-07 07:37:44
On the contrary, I feel this kind of transparency is far preferred to wild community speculation.

I am interested in one to the US, thank you.  
When you say "sign a message," do you mean a reddit pm?  I am a little new to this :)
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:22:19
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:49:08
I see, thank you for that.  If you don't mind clarifying it for me a little bit, how can I know which address my qt client is sending from so that I can sign for it?  
Also, as I understand it, I have to send Silfax the btc address that I sent from, a message (which consists of my physical address), and the signature generated by the qt client.  Is this correct?  Is there anything else I should add to the message?  
Thanks again for helping out a newbie.

Do.  Or do not.  There is no cautiously.
