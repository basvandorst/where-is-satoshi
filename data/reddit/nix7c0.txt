The coin I have I earned from [selling things on Bitmit]( or [answering questions on Rugatu]( My good friend made his by hawking [3D printed Raspberry Pi cases]( and [physical bitcoin wallets]( Whatever your skills are, you might try offering them in the Reddit [BitMarket](
If you're a student in housing where you don't pay for electricity, you might consider mining. As another poster pointed out, this won't make you rich immediately, but even the "pittance" you earn today may be well worth your time in a year or two. Personally, when I got into coins heavily, the most effective way for me to earn BTC was actually to mine LTC and trade it over. Not sure if the margins are that good any more with the higher LTC difficulty, but just keep in mind that the shortest path isn't always a straight line when it comes to cryptocurrencies.

My friend makes [physical coins]( on his 3d printer with 1k NFC tags embedded to do just that.

Seriously guys, every minute you waste not downloading and running this strange .exe you found on youtube which requires your blockchain account details and password is a minute you're not earning free and unlimited bitcoins from nowhere! How could this *not* be legit?

I can hardly think of a more fitting use for this [conjured currency](

For science, our local RepRap collective tried boiling PLA for a week, and it maintained its integrity fairly well. We then let it sit in that water for another six months, and it's still mostly intact, save for a few small flakes floating around. I think the "biodegradable / bio-available" aspect means it will degrade eventually, as compared to HDPE or other common plastics. Still, that will likely take quite a while. Nonetheless, I too will be very interested to see how it fares after a decade.
How's the Printrbot Jr. working out for you guys? I was a little dubious about the design, but it seems to have a good reputation. Also, I'm sure you're aware of this, but on the off chance you're not and for the benefit of others, a great place to find awesome things to make with your 3D printer is [Thingiverse](

From the Spanish wikipedia on [Torrevieja]( which has a more detailed entry than the English, you could find information about where the marker is: a place called The Park of Nations. Put through Google Translate, it tells you that the park "has a lake whose profile corresponds to the map of Europe and has several attractions for children." The location of the marker is roughly where Cyprus is on that model, or close enough  - plus, of course, the bonus from it being a nation most bitcoiners would have heard plenty about. I realized that it obviously had to be the answer as soon as I thought of it, which is the mark of a good riddle in my opinion.

They're about the thickness of two american quarters stacked, and have a hole in them so that you could use them as a keychain, if you like. Not sure anyone ever has. He just keeps them in his pocket or wallet fold, and doesn't even exactly know yet how people will end up using them in practice. Most smartphones from the last few years have an NFC reader built in, but you may have to dig around a little to find your manufacturer's app to utilize it.
If you were interested, am sure he'd be open to entertaining offers from fellow redditors below what he has them listed for on Bitmit. You can PM [EtherDais]( for details

As a fellow 3d-printing and bitcoin enthusiast, I'd be curious to know what you made, and what type of machine you used to make it.

A friend of mine has started making [3D printed coins]( with a near-field communication tag embedded to serve as a reusable and physically transferable wallet. Worth checking out as well if you like the concept.

He did actually [buy some bitcoins and pay for lunch with them in a NYC cafe]( back in 2011. I agree he probably isn't the most knowledgeable person on the subject, but as far as mainstream reporters go, Davidson and Planet Money have actually been paying attention to Bitcoins for a good while and tend to get things more-or-less right.
Also: Happy cake day!

Well, at least you used "it's" correctly this time.
Edit: If I give you my bank account number and PIN, can you make this work for fiat currency too?

Didn't take this picture myself, but thought folks here would get a kick out of it. [Here's the source]( - would've linked to that directly, but having never seen a twitter image posted through Reddit, I assume there must be some reason people don't do that.

When I zoomed all the way into street mode and saw the big gratified word "DOES." I was almost certain I had found the answer. After typing in everything I saw through their streetcar, I was happy to eventually find the actual solution was even more clever.

ASIC's are application-specific integrated circuits - basically a bunch of hardware optimized for a particular purpose. In the context of bitcoins, it means they're designed to generate [hashes]( with the SHA256 algorithm, which is how you "mine" the coins. Avalon, Butterfly Labs, and the like are companies which make these types of ASIC mining rigs. The biggest difference between any of them is their speed, measured in gigahashes, which tells you how many billions of hashes they can generate in a second.

As I understand it, there are a number of factors that keep the price on BTC-E under what you see on MtGox and other exchanges. Notably, you need a minimum of $50 to withdraw funds, and even then, it takes about two days to transfer funds from BTC-E to an intermediary (I forget their name), and a few more days for that intermediary to then transfer it to your bank. On top of that, both parties take a cut on the way out. In part due to these inconveniences and costs, the price of cryptocurrencies there tend to reflect the difficulty of actually using the coins you might trade for there.
