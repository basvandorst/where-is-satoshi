Another option is to wait for the ethos wallet coming out q1 sometime. I'm probably shifting over to that if it's as good as they say it is.

Kucoin and hitbtc are open. Not as big as binance and bittrex but they got a good amount still

Since the amount of people in this cryptoworld still is rather low I'd like to think that it will go up for awhile longer. Hopefully whole 2018.
But eventually if the products doesn't come out as expected there will be a huge correction.
The big question is when.
I like to compare it to the dot com bubble. The internet changed the world just like I think this will. It was still a bubble back then and it went down hard and fast. And it compares well to today. Alot of new companies with big promises and high expectations.

Don't think they can ban people to do it private, but they are not doing it as a company and are not allowed to recommend it to clients.

For the first question if it really turns global it won't be that easy to just ban, like banning video piracy. Some regulations will probably be in place to avoid easy money laundering.
And transfer with bitcoin right now is not a good option because of the fees, but when the lightning network goes full live it should lower the fees and make it viable for that again. As of now it's better to use the likes of Litecoin to transfer funds.

Check out ethos. Wallet release q1. Live fiat crypto exchange in ur wallet

Since the function and technique is still great it will probably just move to another coin as primary tho. The whole crypto movement doesn't live or die based on bitcoin anymore.

Like stocks but with a use in the application, so it's more than just a valued paper. But as of right now it's mostly theoretical uses with few actual releases.

Correct. This is how steady inflation with growing market works.

Your problem will probably be selling what you mine since your underage and almost everything are using some sort of kyc.
You can always mine anyway, you won't automatically get ransomware or anything..

I'm not much for conspiracy theories, but it is of course possible (and easy) to control btc if you got loads of cash, like many other assets. 
He seems to forget about the crash in real estate and bank during the time gold and silver went up. They always do when the other markets sway, it's a safe haven.
Next time the stock market crash you will see another increase in gold and silver. Might be less considering a few will go for crypto instead.

To be fair, this bot behavior also exists in stocks and have been for a good while. Even if there are bots market decides the price. There is nothing really to overcome. Price will go up and down, it's easy as that.

In the end, it's a free market. There's whales who could do the same thing. Don't like it? Leave crypto.

You want do buy decentralized ware from  centralized company and complain when it's not anonymous.
If you want that buy it directly from a person instead.

Source?

So I guess you're actually looking for a medium of some sort. Because what you are asking does not exist in TA.
You sound like a arrogant American so I'm gonna stop right here. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:43:03
Do it
@_date: 2018-04-14 17:23:31
Obvious short squeeze is not tether related.
And I don't really see how tether would affect the price unless they actually print it to buy.
The way it works being traded into for money already in the system it doesn't matter.
You just don't change to fiat and buy in again, but usdt and buy in again.

Congratulate holders? Congratulate to people who sold at 18-19k and buying now. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 00:20:22
Wasn't much to correct, it was a huge short squeeze. Most of the people buying it up bought to cover shorts, which means they got nothing to sell afterwards.
