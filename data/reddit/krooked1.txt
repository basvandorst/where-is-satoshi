oh ok good to know thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:50:40
great input
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:35:58
Yes indeed, me too. But what if they tax it like 50-60%, won't this discourage a lot of people?

Best post ive read here in a while. This will probably get pretty crazy. You've mentioned its not controlled or backed by any government, and that's been keeping me busy lately. What is your take or 'prediction' on possible future government actions?

Said this mainly to keep the lambo and moon posters out :)
I'm not too bright on politics etc, but isn't there some global agreement or anything to decide on things like this?

Interesting. Which stage would you say we are at right now? Enthusiasm? Greed? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:07:46
I agree completely. That said, where do you actually get some decent quality info these days?
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:43:15
wow that was really helpful
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:33:01
Correct :) I don't know why I actually typed original..probably to avoid confusion with btg and bch
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:24:10
Who knows..
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:44:49
Couldn't agree more.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:09:33
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:33:08
Both :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:23
Who gives a fuck honestly
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:54:43
not scared, like i said just a little worried...just want to see some opinions..
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:00:16
haha fuck you :)
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:11:49
Haha indeed
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:56:22
Worst case scenario: you lost 100$. Learn from this and be glad it wasn't 1000$
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:34:49
yes i did. Don't know why I typed original

First off, google can help you with that. I'm kind of in the same position as you, but I havent decided yet if I should go with it. I know that a 'hard wallet' is supposed to be the safest option to store your bitcoin. Coinbase might be a good place to start buying. But then again I might be wrong. Best to do a lot of research first.
