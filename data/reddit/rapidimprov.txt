Apple manages to fuck up something every update

Any specific reason you left out Breadwallet  from your mobile recommendations? It's the only iOS wallet worth using in my opinion.

I have a hard time believing that FinCEN will willingly give up their attempts to control Bitcoin just because another country made it legal tender.

This seems cynical, but also the most likely reality.

I believe you, it just seems ludicrous for LE to literally give you a call and tell you to stop breaking the law.

Sounds like you're talking about of your ass. Bitcoin wallets require little code to write and virtually no prior knowledge to use. 
Blockchain.info is no more impervious to user error than any other service. The losses of its clientele are not a fault of the system itself. 
So tired of seeing people complain on Reddit about systems that I've personally used for 5+ years without a SINGLE hiccup.

I'm not a lawyer, but as I understand it- Coinbase is a US based company and as such, has to abide to US regulations, regardless whether or not their clients are also domestic or international.
Arbitrarily holding your funds without further explanation means its definitely time to get your lawyer in.
