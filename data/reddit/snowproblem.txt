Check out BIP 176: 
1 sat = smallest unit
1 bit = 100 sats
1 bitcoin = 1,000,000 bits

Agree with that. Not sure if you had something specific in mind.

You're just regurgitating Core talking points. I pointed you exactly where in the paper, and you didn't understand it. Here's more:

This is what Bitcoin Cash understands, and why it will win.

Please explain to me how non-mining nodes enforce any rules. I'll wait.

Do you mean a malicious *mining* node? Because mining nodes are all that matter w.r.t. censorship.

You are confused. Bitcoin Cash is peer-to-peer.
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:12:48
No, because it is. Have you read the [whitepaper](
? Bitcoin: A **peer-to-peer** electronic cash system. See page 5 where it says users will not run full nodes. Your non-mining node is useless, and Bitcoin would still be peer-to-peer without it.

Agree. I think there will be a big drop after August 1st due to all the FUD, and a recovery around mid-August. Who knows though.

Not that serious, but a threat still. Given futures for BCC are $400-something, we should expect after the split BTC's price should drop by around that amount. That drop will probably cause even more panic, and I wouldn't be surprised if we touched 2k again.

I know. I can't get my BTC out due to their withdrawal limit. I have written and tweeted them so many times about increasing these limits, but they don't respond. They're stealing users' BCC.
