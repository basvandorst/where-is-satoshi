you are incorrect. all the old software does not work fine.
In fact the network has previously done more than one hard fork. try again please.
in what way is it the same? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:54:33
no you've modified the client to accept segwit blocks. they are not the same blocks. they were not valid. actually you are right they are valid blocks, with transactions that anyone can spend.
that is not what happens now. face it bitcoin changed the rules. it's not the same. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:43:53
you claim bitcoin is still the same.
in what way?
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:05:26
yes but the argument that bitcoin is bitcoin because all previous software works is pointless.
Indeed I can make a version which accepts any blocks no matter the rules.
so my question remains, in what way is it the same? :) 
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:31:58
No actually you are wrong.
Blue means blue because everyone agrees that blue means blue, but if two guys now agree that between that blue is now chair.
blue is now chair. read up on different dialects and how languages evolve.
please please do that for anything before trying to pass it off as a counter argument. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:49:09
thanks for confirming that it works as a medium of exchange. 
that means it's working as intended! You can actually pay for a pepsi!
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:02:11
I did counter your argument. ;) keep trying. still waiting. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:34:08
yes, you are right. this post clearly shows consensus. :)
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:48:17
nice touch with that if ;)
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:50:43
now you're just making up facts.
no devs? have you actually looked?
or are you just considering core devs the best therefore everyone else can't even be called a dev? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:46:09
actually no it doesn't. how do you think British English and US English change over time?
someone sits in a room and makes up words?
no. they come out of groups of people who start using them and then they catch on.
but apparently you just know how to make up arguments and then use the arrogant evolved society answer to back them up.
you clearly have a lot to learn. I hope sooner rather than later.

bcash is an implementation of Bitcoin Cash.
Quadratic hashing was fixed on the first hard fork of Bitcoin Cash.

you don't need to believe me. I'm not selling a religion here. Check the links. It's a fact. But you are free to believe whatever pleases you. I'm not arguing with religion. :) 
@_date: 2018-05-26 12:11:48
seems someone is going for the same under eu.
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:19:06
It is very different litecoin is purely a software fork. You are mixing the forks. There's fork and fork. Not all forks are equal. :) 
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:30:24
It's not listed as such on the majority of exchanges or major news websites, so not sure what qualifies as the whole world for you. 
As for bcash it's an open source implementation by purse io. Feel free to check it out!
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:02:30
everything. shared history means, years spent promoting it. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 12:01:27

@_date: 2018-05-21 02:43:38
your beliefs are your beliefs, but that's it. nothing more. After all who's going to argue with religion. :) 
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:40:31
I'm sorry you were unable to search.
Please find the repo with all the files here:
Also again I'm not sure what rest of the world expect America is to you. As most major news websites and exchanges outside of America do not call it bcash.
You seem to be living somewhere without proper access to outside world.
There are tons of vpn services that can help you with that. If you need some recommendations feel free to ask.

you might want to read up on the difference between a software fork and a blockchain fork. 
@_date: 2019-10-23 12:43:41


good joke :)
@_date: 2019-10-23 10:51:46


and you are comparing that, to this?
you backup your wallet file and that's it.        
compare that, to this... and you can't see how this is not more complicated?
you are literally saying, 'yeah he backed up but he used the wrong backup tool'... that just doesn't happen with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-23 10:31:27


hmmm. no.


hmmm. again no. the funds are not gone. They will remain with you or be sent to the intended destination. 0 or 1. No one can take it.
