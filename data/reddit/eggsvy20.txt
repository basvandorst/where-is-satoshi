Spamming LN with tons of transactions won't benefit them much if you ask me, especially when a transaction is verified only with the consent of both parties in the form of digital signatures. While that won't stop people from transferring BTC to one another, they can however, prevent new members from joining LN or stop users from retrieving their funds from the multi-signature address since these require on-blockchain technology for the transaction to be verified.
What we have really done is to limit the attacks done by miners and malicious parties threatening to attack the Bitcoin network further. They can still do a significant amount of damage if they put in a concentrated effort to disrupt basic economic operations.
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:14:50
The key idea is to allow individuals and traders to have at least a reference for how much Bitcoin is valued in the market. Having a volatile Bitcoin is not going to benefit Bitcoin becoming a currency since no one would ever want to hodl a coin whose value fluctuate between a loaf of bread and a Lambo.
A stable BTC would allow people to use it for everyday transactions, which increases the demand for BTC and therefore, the price of BTC. This increase in BTC is very different from the rest since there is real economic activity and operations behind it compared to just mere speculations from the markets and pump-and-dump groups.

It is definitely more than just economics and currencies at this point. I would definitely say if Bitcoin were to succeed, this herd mentality about fiat currency must be shattered. Of course, I haven't bought into the part of government intervention which causes Bitcoin to fail, since which government would ever allow another currency to dominate its monetary policies?

Probably an outlier or something. I highly doubt those unconfirmed transactions will go away in one sweep.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:08:41
When all of the Bitcoin has been mined by then, the value of Bitcoin will still fluctuate based on the community's involvement, since we will constantly be providing new updates and fixes to the current Bitcoin mechanisms in order to help promote its usage and acceptability. Bitcoin will only truly die if people no longer contribute to the development of Bitcoin and its network.
Of course, Bitcoin, being decentralized, will still be prone to volatility (it will be much worse compared to property, gold and etc.) since it will be vulnerable to market manipulation. Furthermore, with all of the Bitcoin being mined and the only profits taken by miners is through transactional fees, I would say that there will be a power struggle via hash power to see who can provide the most competitive transactional fees in the market (although, these miners can also band together and intentionally raise the fees in order to gain even more profits).

Best of luck in your future trades then. I have took a good hit in my portfolio and I have decided that I will be withdrawing before it affects my overseas trip with my friends next month. I guess that's where my risk tolerance is at.
Either way, my best suggestion is that you read up on the matter of cryptocurrencies. Papers such as "An Institutional Investor's Take on Cryptoassets" are good reading material which articulates on the points of Bitcoin and its technology. 
My take from cryptocurrencies is that while Bitcoin may die in the coming years, its discussions, talks and ideas are far from dead. From ashes, the phoenix will rise again with its reformed ideas and values.

We just need to have an active developmental and community effort by the Bitcoin community if we ever want to see this project through. Too many people who hodl Bitcoin only sees it as an "investment" and think that this is a "perfect and decentralized" system without any flaws of its own.
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:20:42
Definitely. When Bitcoin has established a reference point for its value, it will be used as a medium of exchange and will be actively traded. Of course, Lightning Network still needs widespread adoption, and with these pesky institutions ~~like Coinbase~~, Bitcoin will have several challenges ahead for it to truly be accepted as a global currency of the future.

Instead of seeking for help in Reddit and literally posting your address for the world to see (which breaks r/Bitcoin rules), go and find some legal advice and work from it there.

Banning crypto trading in Asian countries won't help the situation at all. Lies and rumours will still circulate just to get that extra dollar in the market. If anything, it will simply just cause the acceptability of Bitcoin to fall in the long run.
There are also some countries in Asia (Singapore, Japan) who actively support cryptocurrencies due to its nature and value.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:32:47
I can get my bank to do an international wire transfer with slightly higher fees than Bitcoin, but I get to track my own transfers and receive an explanation if things do go wrong. Bitcoin transactions are difficult and tedious to reverse if you do make a mistake in the address (plus, it won't stop people from charging astronomical fees just to retrieve back your BTC balance).
Like I have said before, Bitcoin at its current rate is unfeasible due to its high transaction fees and volatility. Perhaps the fall in the value of Bitcoin is just what we need to bring down transactional fees and make Bitcoin a viable alternative to fiat currency.

Not all governments and countries will benefit from a universal currency, especially China. Having a universal currency where 1 BTC in China is equal to 1 BTC in US will be devastating to the Chinese manufacturing sector and their competitive edge, especially when China is well known for manufacturing goods at a cheap price due to an undervalued Renminbi. That's why you will usually see the Chinese Government taking every step they can to prevent an economic stagnation within their economy.
Singapore will greatly benefit from it since we usually import our goods and resources from overseas. Having a stronger and universal currency such as Bitcoin will surely give us more purchasing power to buy more goods and services overseas.

@_date: 2018-01-14 22:26:30
I do understand that stability is not everything in order to achieve success for Bitcoin, but given our current circumstances with massive market manipulation along with limited acceptability, there must be solutions that address Bitcoin becoming more of a currency than a commodity. The price of a commodity fluctuates greater than a currency does, and that's because people are actively using it.

If you really think that governments will just sit by idly watching a mob overturn their national currency into something else, think again. Their web of control extends far more than we can ever imagine and you can be certain that they will criminalize the possession and transfer of Bitcoin if it ever becomes the dominant currency.
Bitcoin **must** coexist with other real-world currencies out there as an alternate method of payment, not as a challenge to the financial institutions in our world.

@_date: 2018-01-14 21:34:46
It's a paradox, really. If mass amounts of coins are being held up by small groups of people, nothing will stop them from establishing their own institutions and have direct control over Bitcoin. However, these people have their right over their coins and there must be several reasons for it. Could it be because Bitcoin is a better proponent as a monetary store of value rather than a medium of exchange? How about them trying to establish a monopoly since there is a limited supply of Bitcoins every time? (although, that would be incredibly expensive and stupid to do)
Decentralization is definitely important for sure in sustaining the system we share, however, I do believe it is more of a satisficing condition rather than an important one for our time.
@_date: 2018-01-19 10:55:13
Like I said, if you have sufficient grounds or evidence to prove that the US fiat system has caused a massive redistribution of wealth to the rich and that it breeds corruption within the system, please do enlighten me here. Bitcoin must coexist with other fiat currencies, not destroy them and exist as the world's global currency in the world, especially when Bitcoin is useless for everyday transactions and basic economic operations.
You said that I need to do more research on this topic, but you have yet to give a logical reply to my previous statement as to why institutional banks can do the job better than Bitcoin does. I honestly do not care whether do you "see the future you've invested' or that you have spent "5 grands on some 100mb modem etc". If you cannot explain what you are doing logically and want to continue to be a mouthpiece of what "these really smart people" tell you, I would say that you are wasting your own money by dumping it down on somebody's advice.
Make your own assessments and stop spreading or copying what others have told you! Only by understanding the mechanisms of Bitcoin can we truly appreciate the marvels and pitfalls for this revolutionary technology.

I am not a big fan of Bitcoin forks in my honest opinion.

The influx of new capital into the market has nothing to do with the surges and downfalls for Bitcoin. Even though people are now generally pouring money into the market which causes an increase in demand for Bitcoin, the current way of obtaining Bitcoins is through **bidding**. People can generally set whatever price they are content to, they only just need to find another party who is willing to accept their offer at that stated price. (Unless of course, you use Coinbase for your Bitcoins, then good grief.) That's how trading works.
The reason for this crash, as I have stated before, is because the Bitcoin community has continuously refused to accept Bitcoin as a currency and a medium of exchange (excellent for international transactions) but rather as an "investment" and a store of value. If you want the value of Bitcoin to continue rising, you need to have active usage and development for Bitcoin at all times. By using Bitcoin, you can help to increase the demand for Bitcoin within the national economy, which will eventually allow the Bitcoin market to flourish.
No national economies have ever grown by people simply "hodling" onto their currencies. Given Bitcoin's deflationary nature and a tendency to save than to spend, there is an increasing need for us to address this issue in an economical perspective.

You are right that the USD will still exist in our world. No government in the right mind would ever try to oppose any popular movement which is gaining traction, they will simply be feeding into the distrust of its citizens and undermine the confidence and trust of the government system. However, the point I am trying to bring across is that when such a movement jeopardizes the financial system or brings uncertainty within it, governments would rather take the "safe" side of things and avoid financial chaos within the system.
It doesn't have to be a focused attack on Bitcoin, you just need some governments to officially denounce the Bitcoin system and its values and there goes the entire Bitcoin economy.

Regardless, with the fall in the value of Bitcoin, one needs to be skeptical on cryptocurrencies in general. It is incredibly important not to lose your sleep over this worrying over trends and markets and neglect your own social life and friends about it. Spending your time worrying about things you cannot change will eventually affect your work-life balance, and it won't be great especially when you have many years ahead of ya.

Too many people in this market believe that Bitcoin will only rise further and further thanks to its "revolutionary" technology and decentralized network. The thing about decentralized network means that there must be an active developmental team and usage of the Bitcoin currency if we ever want to see Bitcoin be used alongside other global fiat currencies in the world. If we do not address this and continue to see it as an "investment", Bitcoin is effectively good as dead.
What Satoshi has written in his white paper has cleared and broken many technical and security aspects of a decentralized electronic currency. The economic aspects of Bitcoin, however, is flawed by nature and is in need of some revisionism.

• Yes, both users will need to set up LN and Segwit if they wish to get their transactions through.
• This multi-signature address you speak of is initiated when you create a payment channel between both parties. You will need their consent if you wish to create a payment channel with them, although either party can terminate the payment channel when they feel like it.
• When you decide to open a payment network with the other party, a multi signature address is created that involves both parties. If I am not wrong, you do not need to add funds into the multi signature address, especially when it acts like a balance sheet and that all transactions are done off the blockchain.
• I don't get your question, sorry. All wallets that supports Segwit and LN will be able to use LN to transfer funds around.
• No, miners do not validate the transactions. Instead, digital signatures that have been obtained by both parties will act as the validation for these off-the-blockchain transactions. Take it as if you and the seller are acknowledging that this transaction does exist and is approved by both of you. The only time miners are involved is if you create a payment network (which goes into the blockchain) and when you destroy a payment network (so that the miners can finalize these digital signatures).
• My LN terminology isn't the best here, so unless I am missing out something I would also like to know what a "lightning hub" is.

You are actually right about this. Normally I would be a supporter of Bitcoin and decentralized global currency for all people to use, but I truly believe that Bitcoin must and should co-exist with other real-world fiat currencies out there in order to maintain some form of law and order within our society. 
However, co-existence should not be the reason why Bitcoin must remain as a commodity. Active usage of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and strong demand and trust on the Bitcoin technology is key for Bitcoin survival since I do believe Bitcoin is the best way for international transactions and payments (low fees, easy portability and hassle-free) compared to our current banking institutions. Bitcoin, of course, won't be that practical when it comes to buying groceries from your local supermarket, especially when given the market manipulation and low acceptability of Bitcoin due to its volatility.
I highly suggest reading this [document regarding an investor's take on cryptoassets]( in our current financial world. It's a long wall of text for sure, but it's something to consider about.

True, in its current state, governments and banking institutions can continue to print lots of it and devalue the paper note in the future.
The banking system is flawed in nature by many aspects, that's why we have Bitcoin. But using environmental facts and logic between the two systems won't make a very sound and convincing argument, would it?
And nah, Bitcoin just needs to be economical in nature so that it can be a sustainable currency. My two cents though.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:24:55
It doesn't matter whether there is a lost supply of bitcoins floating in space or not. The market only sees those that are being actively traded in a trading book and will only determine the price from there.
Sorry chump, unless someone puts a billion dollar buy order in the market, the price is going to go down.
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:13:14

You can indeed say that the crash in the value of Bitcoin is due to the fact that many people have cashed out their Bitcoins, but don't you think there must be some form of rational and logical reasoning behind this mentality? Sure, "weak hands" can play a part into this - everyone has a different risk tolerance when it comes to investments, but unless you are going to tell me that the majority of the players in this market are sissy cowards, that form of reasoning won't flow - Bitcoin wouldn't even have reached its pinnacle without the support and confidence of the market.
The overvaluation of Bitcoin has definitely played a big part in this. That, and also whale groups threatening to manipulate the decentralized Bitcoin network that we know today.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:16:27
Yes, you are right that currency parity does not necessarily mean that certain countries will lose out in the global market. Of course, there will be many governments offering different rates and subsidies to its citizens which will cause a diverse cost of living around the world, but what I am trying to bring across is that by establishing a universal currency, you effectively limit every single government in this world from controlling the money supply and their monetary policies. Even though currency manipulation will be solved and that international fees around the world will be lower, no government in the right mind would allow a foreign entity to control their money supply. The USD is the world's reserve currency, but why don't we see it being used for everyday transactions in the entire world? (Countries want to feel secure by managing their own currencies, and weighing/comparing them with a basket of other currencies)
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:58:13

I highly doubt that the influx of Tethers into the cryptomarkets will have a significant impact on the price of Bitcoin anyways. Too many people have been recently withdrawing their Bitcoin and altcoin positions in favour of Tether, which has pledged its 1USD = 1USDT, and unless Tether can "magically" destroy their own tokens with a revival of market confidence on Bitcoin, the only time Tether will be a serious issue is when people start selling them back into Bitcoin.

I don't really think we are much in an agreement, given our different perspectives to the market crash and the nature of the market in general.
But yes, even if LN is a success, Bitcoin has work to do if it wants to be a viable and sustainable alternative to fiat currencies in this world.

The thing here is that Bitcoin is an open-source project where anyone can contribute to it. There are no "fixed" developers or some sort in Bitcoin's development.
The inability of the Bitcoin community to address the scaling issue quickly and effectively can be said to have caused the eventual crash of Bitcoin. It just shows how much of a community we are and how we are hardly interested in the technology and development but rather on investments and profits.

If you really think that Bitcoin "still works like it was yesterday", you should just hit yourself in the head with all these ridiculous transaction fees and processing. What Bitcoin is facing right now is very different from what it was a few years back.

First off, which technology will you be forking from?
There are tons of coins out there that have similar ideas and proposals which addresses legitimate or "what-ifs" scenarios and problems within the blockchain technology. If you intend to create your own cryptocurrency, make sure that your cryptocurrency has a solution to a **well-existent problem** within the blockchain or Bitcoin technology. Only then, you can start up with ideas and pen down your thoughts.

~~This is a 30% drop! It will eventually go back up again!! Just shut up and keep HODLing!!!~~
I can assure you, Bitcoin cannot sustain such a high price of even $10K atm. If someone has to pay a large fee just to buy a cup of coffee, it isn't a viable and global currency yet. The only way for BTC to reverse its trend and to grow back to its 20K levels is if **people continue to pump a shit ton of money into this inefficient system**, which I can assure you, there is only so much money you can pump at the time.
I reckon that with high transaction fees and with no assurance when LN will be implemented, along with the challenges imposed by Roger Ver and his BCH, BTC will fall in value - but not in a complete crash. It will likely fall until transaction fees are more bearable for everyone in general since the high transaction fee is directly attributed to the high value of Bitcoin in the first place. Yes, the fall in value in Bitcoin will surely cost the cryptomarkets a lot, but that is what happens when you put too much into an unsustainable system.
Also, screw your trends. Those dictate nothing. The value of Bitcoin is determined by the value of its present and future, not the past.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:51:45

The current situation we are presented with is definitely different from what we have encountered last month, sir.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:29:55
Bitcoin is a currency, similar to the rest of the global currencies out there. For it to be truly accepted and used globally, it must behave like all other global currencies out there. Money must have value, be easily transportable and retrievable, have a stable price and be convenient and economical at times.
Having Bitcoin solely for the purpose of "undermining the centralized control of the banks" defeats the sole purpose of Bitcoin. Destroying one great institution only leaves up room for more of them to grow. Look at the power wielded by the miners and institutions with high hash-rates, they are slowly taking over the roles of centralized organizations and will eventually start exploiting our earnings out of the system.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:09:11
I'd hate to disappoint, but as I mentioned above, money must have value, easily retrievable and transported and must be economical like paper fiat.
Having an asset that requires lots of resources to push it through is not a currency, and it certainly drives away small scale transactions. These people have their priorities straight.

@_date: 2017-12-23 19:53:14
True, but people who are hodling Bitcoins are surely advocating for the eventual use and spread of Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin has been thrown into the global financial system with its purpose being a currency for all to use, it must behave like the rest of the global currencies and not cut corners.
You can argue that currencies must undergo a "store of value" transition, just like gold and when global currencies back then pegged themselves to the gold standard, but you will eventually see why that will eventually become an issue (limited supply and "perceived" value, just like Bitcoin!).
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:12:54
Bitcoin is meant to be used as a medium of exchange for goods and services, not as a store of value for stated goods and services and because of its "scarcity". Any commodity currency that is limited in quantity will eventually run into significant economic problems in the future since we are effectively tying the national economy to the amount of commodity currency we can accumulate. This is one of the significant reasons why the US pulled out of the gold standard in 1971, along with the eventual abandonment of the gold standard around the world since it has proved itself to be inflexible to the current markets of today.
People like you are those who support mercantilism, hoarding (HODLing) tons of commodity currency and not effectively using them. You need to use your bitcoins and stop hodling onto them if you ever want to create a dynamic economy with a consistent demand of bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:26:57
I do wish I have the same optimism as you do, but with many people in this subreddit HODLing and not using their BTC, along with the transaction fees and government regulations we are facing, it is definitely difficult to HODL atm.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:57:43
Most of these arguments against Bitcoin have definitely not stopped me from buying Bitcoin and altcoins, but it's an unfounded fear knowing that the market will go full frenzy when Bitcoin does drop, along with the speculation.

@_date: 2017-12-23 20:39:17
Trust and value. However, I must immediately digress from your point, since the context you are referring to is from the past, and not the present.
Yes, early adopters definitely need to trust on the value of their currency. People who do exchange it also have to accept the same mentality. Precious and limited commodities such as shells and even metal was used because it was fixed. It had not only value, it is also physical as well.
However, there is only so much shells you can pick and so much metal you can mine in this world. Trust and the usability of the currency knows no bounds at all. If people continue to expand their economic network with a fixed value of commodities, do you really think it can start becoming a viable currency in the future?
The topic of discussion has clearly digressed from its original view. We are no longer in the stage where speculation is the way to go in Bitcoin. Yes, no one knows what the fuck is going to happen in the world of cryptocurrencies, but speculation cannot thrive anymore for Bitcoin. Market manipulation and government regulation are key factors that we must take note of if we do wish to see Bitcoin succeed, especially when no one in this world would ever want to trade on a currency that can literally jump by thousands in a few hours.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:38:36
Too many people are still hodling onto the belief that Bitcoin is an investment, not a currency. We need to stop this mentality that it is a *store of value*, but rather a **medium of exchange** for goods and services since global currencies now operate like that. Currencies don't grow in value by simply hodling, you need to spend them - which creates demand for the currency and helps to stimulate the economy and showcase a positive economic outlook. This cannot be more true than in the world that we all live today.
While there is a need for us to use our Bitcoin to help make this decentralized system work, there is a greater need for it to be viable and economical for everyday transactions to pass through. Money must have value, be easy to retrieve, must be obtainable by one source and be economical like paper fiat. However, high transactional fees for a mere transaction isn't going to cut it at all. The implementation of Lightning Network to the Bitcoin system will definitely be better than simply increasing the block size from 1MB (which can drive out mining pools and increase power consumption to mine them, leaving strong and centralized organizations to take over the mining), but there will definitely still be difficulties ahead for Bitcoin in the years to come (Fake transactions to attack or increase unconfirmed transactions will definitely still be around, and LN indirectly solves the transaction fees problem - it can be mitigated if a small group of people rally and dump enough payment networks for it to cause a jam in the system).
I have always had a bearish view of cryptos in general, due to possible government intervention, large carbon footprint, market manipulation and etc. Of course, that doesn't stop me from continuing to buy Bitcoin and use it. Just this week, I bought two books and treated my family for a nice dinner. It was slightly out of a norm to pay with Bitcoins instead of fiat, but it is definitely revolutionary with its technology.
The only way to create demand for a currency is to use it people, stop HODLing and utilize your money for the good of Bitcoin!

I honestly have no affiliations and have little regards with this kind of petty war between BTC and BCH. BCH attacked BTC to prove its point that lower transaction fees are the way to go, but it still has a long way to go if it doesn't have the lion's share of the entire crypto market.
At this point, it's not about the conflict between these two megacoins. It's whether crypto is sustainable enough to be used as a medium of exchange with limited supply and usage.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:17:38

Bittrex and Gemini are good alternatives imo, low transaction fees (~0.25%) and high uptime (although Bittrex's BTC withdrawal fees at 0.001 BTC is ridiculous, and Gemini's currently down for some 'maintenance'). 
If you want to avoid having downtime, it's always best to diversify the number of exchanges you use. A slight hassle, but it's good to have a place to buy / transfer your BTC when one goes down.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:57:09
The creation and destruction of payment networks require all of them to go through the blockchain, yes? Both of them do count as two transactions, and everything in between is written off the books. Since there are no prerequisites for payment network to be created (it can be peer to peer or organization) and it only requires the consent of both parties for it to be created and only consent from either party to destroy it, I reckon that people can mass create and destroy payment networks with a small amount of transaction inside them to disrupt the blockchain network and fill up with false transactions, just that it's bigger in size. It is something that has been boggling in my head, although other methods are indeed possible.
Yes, I agree that individual channel fees can be small, but only if we do follow the supply-demand mechanism. As they are counted as a "transaction" in the blockchain, regular transaction fees will apply to them as well. As seen that many of these economic mechanisms don't work as intended due to manipulative intentions to keep the fees high (which I repeat, is beneficial to miners), it can definitely cause undesirable effects to the fees. There must be a deliberate and concise effort to get miners to keep their fees low regardless of the price of Bitcoin, but that requires centralization - a concept that Bitcoin is against.
Other than that, I stand corrected in most of your points.
Anyway, hoping to looking for more discussions regarding this! I would also like to know more about this as well.
Also, r/Bitcoin is probably not the best site for you to have constructive discussion here. You would most probably get memes for your time here.
I forgotten to mention about the part where you mentioned about payment networks not necessarily having to be created on demand and can be created when it is not time-critical. Sadly, I have to disagree with you on this part. As Bitcoin becomes a global currency that is easily tradable in many platforms, it must be able to handle on-demand payment networks at any given point of time, be it critical or not. Having a currency that only does the action on the wee hours in the morning certainly isn't going to cut it for some people, and it can lead to complications if they are not approved by a miner (possible double spending?).
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:27:43
You can continue being a bagholder if you like. BTC needs LN right now if we ever want to see it go back up to 20K levels.
That, or we see the drop in value until the fees are cheap again.

@_date: 2017-12-23 11:30:35
Just read up about Lightning Network, sure having "off-the-blockchain" transactions is nice and healthy to the Bitcoin economy, and it can definitely reduce the number of unconfirmed transactions in the blockchain, which can reduce the transaction fees according to supply-demand mechanisms.
I just hope that there isn't any attempts by large-scale miners to soak up the blockchain with fake transactions and any potential hassle in the blockchain from consistently creating and destroying payment networks between parties.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:24:29
You can do a custom rate at 10 sat/b for sure, but that transaction will take literally ages for it to be processed. Bitcoin transaction fees are currently very expensive right now (due to the high price of Bitcoin as well), and along with [this]( you will have to pay the usual fare if you want some priority in your transactions.

To see it in percentage gains or losses is nothing at all. What is the point of it when people **don't** use Bitcoin for their everyday transactions after all? You claim that people see Bitcoin's price as a share, but isn't this the herd mentality that everyone is following in r/bitcoin right now? "Look at the percentage gains and keep HODLing, we are still up +31471034%!!!".
We need to start effectively using our Bitcoin and lower our fees, only then we can start challenging the financial system that Bitcoin is truly a cheap and decentralized global currency for all to use.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:53:54
I understand that LN might not be ready for liftoff, but without this - it becomes too expensive to even conduct basic economic affairs and operations. Money must have value, be simple and easy to retrieve along with being convenient and economical at times.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:39:58
Bitcoin has always been a currency, a **medium of exchange** for goods and services and not the value of the goods and services itself. It must behave just like every other currencies the world operates, such as the paper fiat. I really do support the growth of this movement, especially with its revolutionary technology and profits, but it has its own flaws and misgivings. I really do want this to succeed even though I hold bearish views on cryptocurrencies as a whole, not because we all can get rich, but because its concepts branches out from traditional economics in the real world.
What we are facing here is not about the conflict between BTC and BCH - that could have been finished as an attack cannot be fueled for that long without consistent and large pumps. The high transaction fees and unwillingness of the general public to use their bitcoins served as fuel for the raging fire to come. Bitcoin is doomed to fail at this current pace because it had limited supply and a deflationary pressure, which meant that the value of bitcoin will eventually rise over time. This is great news for those who HODL, but if no one uses the coin for commerce and trading, it is effectively good as dead. You don't see economies grow by having people hold onto lump sums of money; they spend it which sitmulate the national economy, giving the state a healthy economic outlook.
The fall of BTC is due to the growing problems of its mechanisms that the developers have failed to address. Roger Ver just simply ignited the fire by simply challenging the system with his BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:47:41
I'm not saying that releasing broken code should be done for the good of Bitcoin. What I am saying is that there should be a sense of urgency with this matter, especially when BTC owns the lion's share in the cryptomarket.
Releasing broken code is irresponsible, sure. But having people to pay $50 transaction fees **right now** is just as good as a "fuck you" to these people.

Don't let your own emotions play out your logic, as long as there are willing buyers who are buying at the dip, it will eventually go back up again. Heck, I am even trading with a 10% loss in my portfolio (I bought in at 15150), but I do believe it will climb up again.
What goes down will eventually come back up!

@_date: 2017-12-24 09:33:06
It's okay haha. These discussions should always be best done during your leisure time. :)
Yes, you are right that this is indifferent compared to the transaction spamming we are facing in the blockchain. However, this factor should always be accounted for since it has the potential to disrupt and influence the economy of Bitcoin. I do believe that it can be resolved if the other party of the payment network to set up penalties for those who continuously create and destroy payment networks, but since anyone can create a payment network as it is peer-to-peer, enforcing that rule can be difficult.
Creating channels cheaply is the same as getting the transaction fees to go low since I have mentioned before that the opening and closing of a payment network is regarded as two transactions in the blockchain. However, I do get what you are trying to get across:


If you pay a "pseudo one-time fee" to create a payment network with an entity that has multiple payment networks to several organizations and entities, you are literally paying a one-time fee for your goods and services until you close your payment network. This is good news in an economic sense, since being connected to around 87% of the network is already good enough, and that transaction fees will go down due to a drop in transactions in the blockchain. However, these issues will run into a major problem, specifically with the centralization of payment networks (PayPal). Having one entity to control the majority of the payment networks instead of having the majority of the users being interconnected with one another can lead to consolidation of an important aspect of Bitcoin to the organization. Sure, they can charge low and have competitors, but nothing will stop them from earning that extra dollar. This can be negated, however, if transaction fees go low, which require miner's support (and we know how that will turn out to be).
Subsiziding fees to open/close payment networks is a good way to encourage usage and growth of the Bitcoin network. However, these subsidiaries often have a motive behind; economic competitiveness and PR potential. Subsiziding fees will, of course, be beneficial to all parties until these institutions have gained a consolidation of power, which by then nothing can stop them from amending the fees directly or indirectly (*ahem Coinbase ahem*)
Other than me agreeing with the rest of the points and having my viewpoint changed about LN (thanks!), I have been thinking about the possibilities to reduce reliance on the Bitcoin blockchain and to make Bitcoin more of a viable currency for everyday transactions instead of a mere "investment". These ideas are speculative, so do pardon me if I am wrong in certain aspects.
Since Bitcoin requires full cooperation and reliance on the blockchain, and that all transactions have to go through miners and security verifications to get it to be confirmed, I believe that there should be an easier method of transferring Bitcoins around through the use of paper currency and such. Now, I know this is similar to what we have in our current financial system, but the key idea around here is to "get people to deposit funds into a multi-signature address similar to LN, and allow them to 'print' their own amount of money with its security coding that can only be transferred between two users with the approval of both parties upon verification of the security coding within the multi-signature address. The funds are then credited back to their respective accounts if a party has decided to withdraw the value of the printed paper money, which then undergoes as a transaction in the blockchain". This can be somewhat indifferent from LN that we have here, but the key concept here is to move money around parties more efficiently and quickly without having to be reliant on the blockchain for small-scale transactions. This will definitely bring security risks for sure (degradation, potential double spending, fraud) but it has been boggling in my head for quite some time, so I am willing to speak it out for a bit.
Anyway, here's to hoping of more meaningful discussions such as this one!

Unless you are absolutely fine with BTC the way it is and want to continue HODLing throughout the highs and lows, fine by me. The vision of BTC was to make it a decentralized peer-to-peer currency that is viable for everyday use; BTC in its current stage is way too expensive for use atm, people are just simply HODLing and viewing it as an investment.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:51:26
There is definitely a need to shift away power from the miners to the users of Bitcoin. If you grant a small amount of people incredible amounts of hash power to decide, they can really have a say in our system.

A drop in price which results in a drop in fees is the same as vice versa. Both of them are directly correlated to each other.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:05:03
You forgot about manipulation.
You just need a group of people a tad smarter to continuously create and dump these payment networks in order to achieve their justifications - be it political or economical.
Miners with great hashing power might not like to see their fees cut, and while they cannot directly influence the fees - their echoes can disrupt basic economic operations.
Also, LN does not directly solve the transaction fees issue. LN, in my point of view, is simply an "all-in-one". Reducing the fees due to LN has always been based on the supply-demand mechanism, since too little people are mining an enormous amount of transactions. As stated above, people can artificially modify the fees.
As opening up a payment network and closing it requires it to go through the blockchain, extra increments might be charged on both parties. This can be a hassle, especially when both parties are not of equal leverage (a customer and a restaurant) and charges might actually be one-sided.
As not all transactions are of the same nature (some use BTC for food, others for services), it can lead to complications and difficulties. Some goods and services are time-sensitive and cannot be sustained under this network.
This is all I can think of, hit me if I am wrong though.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:52:58

Do you see Bitcoin as a game where we manipulate one another to gain our profits, or do you see it as a revolutionary technology that can ultimately change how our financial system works in the future?
You are right that Bitcoin is different now, we always encounter new problems and hurdles to overcome as a community and a currency. However, if you say that Bitcoin will eventually be a "big dog's game" where only the rich can play, then Bitcoin has ultimately failed to be a global currency as to what Satoshi envisioned.
I said this before, you don't exclude people from having money. This is similar to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:24:32
This. With high transaction fees and possible government intervention on Bitcoin, there's very little justification for it ever becoming a universal currency.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:07:58
You don't necessarily have to like the fools who made this coin. I threw in some of my money into it as protest against the high transaction fees against BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:52:44
I also do hope a fix will be in due time soon. Here's to hoping that LN will be released asap.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:23:22
Gemini can be your next best bet if you live in their area of operations. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:34:21
It's ridiculous indeed. Having to pay such high fees just for a single transaction isn't going to cut it as a viable currency in the future.
What's more ridiculous is the number of people advocating to buy and HODL while dismissing legitimate problems to BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:04:42
If you mean BTC working as in paying high fees and waiting a shitton of time just for it to get processed, then sure, it *sure* is working right here.
And I apologize if 15 people per second can pay such an absurd amount of tariffs just to pass money to another person, I must be living in a third world country.

I'd hate to admit it, but it's true. Until Bitcoin can fix its own problems, the bearish trend continues.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:09:43
That, too as well. High transaction fees and slow transaction speed are things that don't go well together in making a universal currency such as Bitcoin. I am currently holding a small portfolio of Bitcoin atm, but the nature of this operation is definitely what gets me.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:35:02
I would buy in back into BTC when the attacks have probably settled and there's at least **some** confirmation of the release of LN.
I like making informed choices.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:21:44
Yes, I do agree with you that early adopters of Bitcoin will have to speculate and perceive it as a "store of value". It has been written in history before. As much as this is the first step towards making a currency, there's only so much that speculation can do when economic networks get bigger and more people are using it. You can't just speculate your way through that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:08:09
I was typing this short wall of text as I was on the train back home, pardon me if this was a tad late.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:18:04
You are right about this. Money has value because we perceive it to have value. It's the same for gold and other precious commodities that we hold today.
For money to have market confidence, it doesn't need to have high growth in the trend charts everyday. You just need it to be relevant and useful to our everyday lives, which is what that is greatly needed with Bitcoin right now. The problem with that is that it's decentralized nature ticks off government officials (why would you ever allow others to control YOUR currency?) and its economical problems (high trx fees, and soon to be high power consumption, did you know that BTC consumes the same amount of energy as Ecuador?) will eventually pose a valid and sound threat to Bitcoin. This is what that contributed to my bearish views of Bitcoin, and latest attempts to convince me otherwise (Lightning Network, increasing blockchain size) has been skeptical to me.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:20:27
That's true; Bitcoin has mostly been about speculation.
You got me good there.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:22:16
Bitcoin as a commodity might be an interesting tale to see, I will admit, although if it does go to that direction, it has surely forsaken its original path in becoming a viable currency for everyday use. I do really hope that it won't fall to that direction, although I reckon that if it does, it might be more stable for it that way.
I don't particularly live in the US sadly (I live in Asia), so I have very little knowledge as of how the Feds do their job and work. I do know that Bitcoin is essentially flawed at its nature, and while our financial system has not produced a "perfect" currency for all to benefit, Bitcoin needs to step up its game and be competitive just like the rest of the global currencies out there. It's true that investments and futures are on its way to Bitcoin, but there should be more work to be done to Bitcoin to help sustain its decentralized and universal system in times of growth. If Bitcoin cannot do that, most of what we have achieved have been for naught.
Also, I will take up that bet. I do hope I am wrong. ;)

@_date: 2017-12-21 18:55:21
No problemo. It's a shitstorm out there, take [this]( and do your own research.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:49:44
Agreed with you entirely. BTC will crash not because of Roger Ver or market manipulation, but it will crash because no one is using it at all.
BTC is similar to what the gold standard is; limited in quantity, but infinite when it comes to value. We only give BTC value because we believe in it, that is, until we stop using it altogether and discard it.
People need to realize now that BTC is a **medium of exchange** for goods and services, not as the value for goods and services.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:25:32
There's only so much money that can be pumped into a system where fees are absurd.
Bitcoin cannot sustain itself as a viable currency if people keep seeing it as a "store of value", not as a **medium of exchange**.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:51:22
Read [this]( up before you start spewing up more nonsense from baseless conjecture, there's a direct correlation between BTC prices and its transaction fees.
As I stand, Bitcoin without LN is only sustainable as a currency when it has a low price.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:44:08
This. THIS. **AND THIS.**
Too many people are being blindfolded into thinking that BTC will probably recover because "it's supposed to" and from previous trends. Crashes can happen any time and any place, will you be okay if BTC drops by 20%? 50%? 80%? How about when the whole thing flops over?
Nobody knows what the fuck is going to happen in the world of cryptocurrencies. With market manipulation and government regulation in one hand and high and long transaction fees on the other, there is a need for us to start being rational for once and stop falling into the hypocrisy that BTC will eventually recover. For BTC to truly grow and start becoming a universal currency, we need to start *using* it, and not just merely HODLing it like an asset. By using the currency as a medium of exchange and for everyday transactions, we can prove to governments and institutions that BTC is here to stay, and that no government monetary policy will dictate how the free market economy will perform.
Of course, with these absurd fees atm, I really do hope that LN gets released soon...
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:45:24
Wall Street isn't as dumb as you think. They obviously would want to reap their gains similar to you guys, just that they have the financial assets to play a longer game of attrition in the market. Just one snap and boom, everyone's savings and investments are gone.
The dot-com boom and housing market boom is similar to Bitcoin right now, limited usability and illiquidity. Heck, the gold standard we have previously used in our financial system can also be related to Bitcoin since both of them have a fixed amount of supply in the system. If you truly want Bitcoin to be the next movement in our financial system, think rational for once and stop playing your HODL games just because BTC will *never fall*. The high transaction fees along with the challenges imposed by other cryptos will spell a doom for us all. Remember that cryptos can fall to its demise, but I am certain that its impact on our current system will definitely allow people to learn from its flaws, and eventually reach a greater system than it is today.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:21:04
It's okay, I wasn't here to impress you or anything in the first place.
I am merely giving a critic over this flawed system of ours. As of now, we need to fix things up if we want BTC to start moving in the right direction.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:49:44
You meant in the test net. Yes, I did see that, but when is that solution going to be implemented so that we can stop paying these ridiculous fees?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:33:18
If every single household have a miner at work, it will definitely decrease fees eventually, but that will make Bitcoin the most power-intensive currency to have ever been implemented. Imagine what would governments think of the environmental costs...
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:43:05
Probably the high traffic and volume. My wire transfers are stuck for 3 days as well.

I understand what you meant by not rushing it, but don't you think the fees are absurd right now? Prices are dropping but still, we are paying ludicrous fees!
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:10:52
Governments that have undervalued their currencies for a long time (China, and to a smaller extent, South Korea) in an effort to retain their competitive edge in manufacturing and production are more prone to enact regulations on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. They definitely can't afford a universal currency where 1 BTC in the US is the same as in China.

Have you ever seen national economies grow by having people to HODL their coins? It's not about people having to be "talked" into spending, they **need** to spend the currency. It encourages domestic consumption within the national economy, incentivizing people to create more goods and jobs for the nation.
And yes, political activism has never been a great tool to drive people there. Like I said before, everyone thinking of Bitcoin as a damn investment, not a currency to use.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:29:34

You're better off giving facts and evidence for your claims you make rather than pointing fingers and blaming it on "trends" and mob mentality.
@_date: 2018-10-13 08:04:50
The issue is that of reliability, not of time or the difficulties in obtaining Bitcoin. It is now just as easy to obtain Bitcoin as it is with US Dollars with a licensed money exchange, but the concept and reliability of Bitcoin as a global currency is flawed in nature. If a currency is stated to cause deflation due to its consistent supply, and that demand for such a currency is determined by a few large whales calling the shots, then it is not a currency to begin with. It is unreliable because the value of Bitcoin keeps changing, and that often we are plagued with “fake news” of governments banning Bitcoin when it is false.
Saying that “Bitcoin is at its infancy, give it more time” won’t just do. Every currency is competing in the global market for dominance (just like the USD) at that specific point of time. If a currency and an application of that technology fails, it fails.
@_date: 2018-10-13 07:09:35
It’s not a safe haven if the value of Bitcoin isn’t predictable and stable. Bitcoin can no longer be relied upon as a currency, just a commodity like gold.
@_date: 2018-10-13 14:05:28
You are still not getting my point. Even if people would want to avoid to go through Coinbase's KYC (or not, it really is about the concept of accessibility to Bitcoin; you can't exclude people from having money) to obtain Bitcoin, the concept and value of the GBTC is really, about deriving the **value of Bitcoin**. Check out their [homepage]( that's the first sentence that caught my attention.
You said that technology takes a long time to catch on, which I can agree on provided if said technology proves to not only be useful, but also **needed** by market forces. We have tons of new technologies in this new decade: artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, *cryptocurrencies*, driveless / electric vehicles and augmented and mixed reality technology, but you see that some technologies are being more prioritized and well-developed compared to the rest of them. Why is this so? It's as simple as what you said, "many people have heard about it, but barely anyone has bought any", which not only explains for its volatility but also the lack of **market confidence and trust on Bitcoin**. People don't buy and get into Bitcoin not because "it's a new technology and people don't know about it", but rather because the people who went into it got the short end of the stick due to the bubble - and those who haven't gotten into it now see the consequences of Bitcoin rather than the benefits it might bring.
I agree with you fully with your third statement that once Bitcoin becomes more widely adopted, its volatility will slow down and there will be more equal power distribution amongst those who do use Bitcoin. The only issue and obstacle that prevents Bitcoin from ever achieving a comfortable dominance along with the rest of the global currencies is that world governments are very reluctant to approve of it (a single world currency like the Euro demolishes a government's monetary policy and its control over its money supply, and which governments (especially China) will approve of a currency that will take away half of their ability to control the markets?) and that this "fake news" hoax on Bitcoin not only damages the reliability and value of Bitcoin, but also market confidence of its consumers, given that there is no single reliable central authority to turn into for reliable sources.
Regardless, given our discussions here and there, its suffice to say that we won't be reaching an agreement anytime soon. Let's just agree to disagree, then?
@_date: 2018-10-13 16:47:05
I guess you can say that. Only time will definitely tell for sure how Bitcoin will develop over the next decade. The most important thing that I’ve held about Bitcoin is that it is an open community project, and that we as consumers must also be developers and partake in active community development of this free project if we ever want to see Bitcoin becoming the “only free” currency in our world.
And just for ya info, I am still holding onto some BTC and ETH haha. Definitely will be increasing holdings of them alongside with US investments given how it’s a good time to buy right now.

That regulation was set into place to ensure that major financial institutions will be responsible for the exchange and transfer of Bitcoin due to newer forms of digital payments arising in this decade. While it does help to prevent such funds from falling into the wrong hands (terrorism), MAS has strictly stated that [no financial institutions can transact more than $3 million or hold more than $5 million worth of Bitcoin per month]( What you have there is simply an incomplete article of [the Singapore’s government stance on cryptocurrencies in general](

Yup, definitely a good reputable bank can do that for me and also help me trace it **other than mistyping a single letter in the address**.


The only stubborn mind would be you, who would go around wasting time on Reddit bashing others for their pessimistic view on Bitcoin.

If this is the mentality that you buy your own stocks with, it's a no wonder you got into Bitcoin which is way worse than conventional stocks.


And how soon is that? Weeks? Months? Maybe even years? Like I said before, **the community isn't doing anything**.
Honestly, it's hilarious to chat up with ya with your skewered mindset on Bitcoin. Not too sure whether you have any other vocabulary to tag people with other than being "stubborn", but hey, you do you with your money. I probably won't care if you are broke. Thanks a lot for making my morning. :)
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:24:50
Because Bitcoin has always been about community transparency and consistent development. The system we have here is not perfect. Unfortunately, some people who invested in BTC are gambling at this point - not believing in the technology and not actively supporting the community development of Bitcoin.
When all of these accumulate up, that’s how you get a market crash.

So you are saying that the price of Bitcoin doesn't matter and that the potential of the technology is what's important? ok sure, tell me more about what bitcoin can do for ya
Decentralized and global currency? No need for that, your major retailers down the street ain't gonna use them given how volatile it is.
To break the chains of government control? Which **sovereign government** would even allow another entity to control their monetary policy? And don't give me that fear excuse, every government in this world hasn't adopted or endorsed Bitcoin yet.
Evolving blockchain technology? For the past year, Bitcoin has had a lacklustre development because the community is more interested in **making money** than actively engaging in community discussions and helping in ***its development***. Bitcoin is an open project, not a closed one.
When the market is bull, everyone talks about lambos and shit, **since the things they buy in the end will have to be converted back into dollars, a reliable currency**. But when the market goes south, suddenly everyone goes berserk and starts giving lame excuses for the market crash.
If ya wanna hodl onto those coins, have it at ya. It's your money after all, I don't care. Just don't go around bashing others just because they have an opinion different from yours.

You may claim that the solution is to get everyone to have the same "trusted" entity beforehand and to use that as comparison when things go wrong. However, when that "trusted" entity of yours takes forever to download and has been **attacked** by malicious spam, I would say that having an entity to deal with the security situation with their best team is far better than getting everyone to download 160 GB+ of worthless data just for "comparison".

I would rather have them improving the security aspects and being secured rather than getting millions to download data just for comparison purposes. It's definitely sad that people will attempt to crack the system or that a breach of trust can happen in there, but if government intervention happens and we hold these people accountable, these people will know that they will have to bear the consequences for the rest of their lives.
And yes, businesses and organizations are run for profit. You can't stop that and neither can I. Similarly, Bitcoin works best when you use it, not hodling. National economies don't grow with people hodling onto their national currencies.
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:37:53
Probably should wait a while more, price might fall even further due to panic selling and fud
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:47:11
Yes, definitely. I hate to admit it, but Bitcoin's complete reliance on blockchain technology has been partially the reason for its own downfall. The fact that everyone will have to download the latest ledger with **all** of the transactions in it makes the blockchain extremely big to store and use (just to store everybody's transactions, and that's all!), and Bitcoin's developmental pacing has been rather slow in a community level (Bitcoin is an open-source project, anyone can contribute into it. However, too little people actually do and tend to delve onto past achievements like LN).
I know I will be down-voted like hell and given the boot for this, but let's be realistic for once. Altcoins like Monero has already been implementing smaller blockchains and improved security whilst reducing transactional fees and time. Furthermore, the fact that people can attack blockchain technology directly to slow down the Bitcoin network while still requiring people to download the latest ledgers shows that Bitcoin is in need for some revisionism here. Bitcoin may die today or tomorrow, but we all will have to pave the way for the next generation of cryptocurrencies to solve the issue its predecessor faced.

@_date: 2018-02-01 11:03:32
You just proved my point right there, do you think anyone can have 160+ GB of memory lying around just to download transactions that are irrelevant to you? Lightning Network solves most of that aspect, but having that amount of memory needed just to download that shit isn't going to help anybody's case.
Yes, Monero needs more space to mask their addresses, that's the point that they have been advocating for the entire time: privacy. The blockchain size is around 30+ GB and I know that it's smaller blockchain can be attributed to its smaller market cap. Furthermore, you can tell that their community takes this issue into account and wants to address it asap, unlike the complete lack of urgency for this matter in Bitcoin.
If you are going to shoot me personally, I would rather that you give me a full scale argument on that. No point nitpicking points and exaggerating claims.
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:33:14
That was done months ago. If there's any recent development effort that has been implemented into the Bitcoin network, prove your point and stop making baseless conjecture. If you claim to know what you are talking about, why not we start with you explaining how it fundamentally works?
I am sorry that you are able to afford a 1TB drive which many people around the world are unable to, it must really suck looking at your first-class paradise whilst thousands are stuck in this peasantry place.
You are right that not everyone will be willing to run a full node, but what I am advocating here is that it must be economical and efficient for the population to use. Having to download a large amount of data just to run a full node is impractical in the long run.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:53:09
It is true that having a small group of individuals to control the security of the network is unwise at best. Bitcoin technology and innovations has definitely solved the technical and security aspects of creating a decentralized currency for sure, however it's economical aspects are at best flawed with our current system.

I agree with this. ✌️️
People don't run businesses out of goodwill. They do it just for profit and competition. People who fail to grasp this concept don't understand how economics run in our current timeline.

I am not speaking for myself. I am speaking for the thousands of people who might not be able to afford (or see the value of owning) a 1TB drive, you dumbfuck. You don't exclude people from having money, same goes for Bitcoin. Either you get everyone on the system, or it falls.
"Everyone is shrinking transaction size"? Are you even serious for once? Bitcoin has been about maintaining the 1MB block size quota and with the possibility of increasing it in the near future. People are not working to decrease it (it makes the blockchain larger and is impractical), they are just discussing when to start increasing the blocksize at the **right time**.
Yeah, 160 GB is the price you pay for a decentralized system. You forgot to put the "++" in there, buddy. Blockchain size will increase over time and I can confidently assure you that it will become a problem in the future. If I can solve it like you said, I will definitely be preached like a god in the future, but alas, no.
Reread my points, do your own research, and come back to me with some valid points for once. Throwing back at ya, ignorance doesn't pay itself in this modern world of ours.

I am not saying that you need to have a full node to use Bitcoin. **Read my lips, this full node needs to be efficient and economical for people to use in general.**
You didn't answer my previous question onto explaining what Segwit and Schnorr signatures are about. Like I said, explain them and stop being evasive and defensive on my questions.

I am just stating that we don't need Bitcoin in the world stage at this moment. International wire transfers and payment organizations can serve to fill up the economical purpose what Bitcoin is about: conducting international transactions with ease and minimal fees. If people do find it useful, that's good for them. Everyone leads to different conclusions due to their different lifestyles and I wouldn't say that my point is absolute.
I agree with you that Bitcoin is a voluntary option out there. However, the aspects of government monopoly on money is something I cannot agree with. Governments would rather be in charge of their own national currencies so that they are able to take monetary policies into their own hand and play fast with the system if crisis hits the system. It is definitely not an immediate and reliable fix for sure, but it at least allows for immediate and efficient response timing.

Not really. Dips are usually caused by market fluctuations and forces. It is inevitable as part of the free market.
A crash, however, is not.
