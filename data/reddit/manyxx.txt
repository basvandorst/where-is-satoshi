[Wouldn't the bitcoin code actually be brought to life by the meaning/purpose people attribute to it thus making the human mind like a compiler and the place where any potential sentient AI originates? If the human mind is the originator of all things wouldn't that mean that anything that exist intrinsically has a purpose thus validating the teleological argument for God? Also wouldn't the human mind, because of its compiler like nature, converge at some level into one point/singularity from which everything would unfold, like a fractal, thus making nature only an extension/reflection of our subconscious mind? Are we just virtual machines running on a single piece of conscious and self aware hardware, that's at the same time abstract and concrete, that resides outside all conceivable dimensions because it's nature is infinitely superior to the mind, while enclosing everything that can ever exist, and interact with each other through the interface provided by this point of origin through which we gain physical properties that derive from our own self created beliefs relative to the absolute truth, which is a constant, that can be considered the universal protocol of life?](
