superannuation is our version, only for that to be viable you pretty much have to be continually employed and constantly have money going into it or it gets eaten up with fees.
I lost nearly all of mine from fees when I stopped working to raise children. So we are going to have a massive influx in old women in immense poverty when my gen get old. We won't be getting old age pensions like they do now. We are supposed to rely on super but it's not going to be possible.
In the year 2035 Australia will be a sex tourism destination for people who want to have sex with wrinkled old women.

I don't understand why people think this is fake.
My youngens love bitcoin. They don't quite understand it yet but they still collect it and get part of their pocket money in btc

I pay pocket money to my son and two nephews in bitcoin. (8, 9 and 6 years old) 
They're saving bitcoin already, they play games like sarutobi and claim faucets but they don't quite get the whole thing yet. 
I will say I will give a thousand satoshi to whoever cleans the shower or take the rubbish out, whatever, and they all jump up like as if it's a lot of money :p if I am feeling like a hook nosed banker I will say massage my feet for 100 satoshi and they still think they're getting a mad deal.

Good luck. This sucks
