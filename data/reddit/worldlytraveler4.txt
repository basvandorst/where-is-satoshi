viabtc doesn't work any more, i'm 99% sure on this because i used to use it... even after 5 seconds after the hour

The bitcoin ATM wallet is hardly responding and I've asked for private key which they won't give :( 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:44:29
are you sure?  Someone said it's being rebroadcast, does that reset the time frame?  I rebroadcast once or twice and I posted in a chat where someone I think is rebroadcasting it as a prank too :P
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:41:30
yeah I think someone is pranking me by rebroadcasting but I also rebroadcast it...
so every time I rebroadcast it resets??

Hi XXX,
We cannot cancel transactions once they've been broadcast. Unfortunately that is a risk of sending with low fees.
GREAT... now where are my private keys, lol......
this is all i've heard from them after many weeks

Thanks!!!!  This is awesome, I have to think about how to accomplish this :)
@_date: 2017-08-16 03:58:57
Yeah I guess those are almost here for bitcoin, just slow to be ready... might as well wait for those :) seems easiest!

Thank you so much for this.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  Learning just by the book wasn't working for me, so just learning through bitcoin projects seems like the perfect path for me.  
I will try this with notepad++ ... I am actually on macbook but that's fine can figure out the minor details.  
I'm super excited to start building stuff :P  In general though I do want to aim towards a steady income because right now I'm driving for a living.  I'm just gonna figure that working through problems and creating my own projects may just be the path towards that steady income once I learn enough tools and build something I can call my own!

That sounds like a great idea... making complicated bitcoin transactions much more simple is definitely a space that needs improvement.  I like the job satisfaction of working with bitcoin since helping build the community garners respect even when you're in it for yourself and your own path.  
I agree completely that I wouldn't mind being a coding drone for a while, just so long as I was on the path to being creative.  As a musician I get bored easily and need to stay on the move.  Currently as a driver I have finally caved and realized being a coding drone wouldn't be so bad as long as I'm interested in it. 
With bitcoin being added to the mix I can definitely see myself solving problems and working on projects.  I have a long way to go and will start looking into javascript, python, ruby.  Those three so far sound like they would come in handy!
@_date: 2016-07-25 12:27:16
Got it, Javascript, then look into Python and should pick that up quickly!  Do you have any idea about the best way to pick up the language?  These boot camps in SF/NY cost $10,000+.  Is there a way to fully immerse myself in the language by just watching videos online or will I not pick up enough or get bored.  
The way I tend to learn is to get obsessed with something and then just barrel through it.  If I'm not into it it's quite difficult but it can be done.  What does it take to pick up a language like javascript for a coding newbie?

This is great.  Thank you so much for your explanations.  Code school does seem worth it but only if I can really grasp a passion for coding on my own with a few of my own projects before even thinking about it.
I'd like to start looking into these three languages and see what I can do with them.  Thank you for breaking this down for me - will be referring back to your post as my understanding of these languages builds.  
With code school I do feel being fully immersed could help me learn in a crash course but paying $10k+ and I have no experience coding is tough.  I certainly have tons of computer experience and am confident I can grasp it with enough work and focus.  
@_date: 2016-07-25 12:25:26
I feel the same way.  Coding just seemed so blah to me... nothing interests me.  Finally I got a real spark when messing around with bitcoin the other day.  I've been a long time bitcoin advocate and junkie.  
I'm excited to dive into coding as it really will beat other professions I'm looking at for the long term for myself.  I'm a musician and driver and need something to fall back on.  I know I'm smart enough to pick up coding, I just need to fall in love with it in order to truly learn.  Otherwise I have a real hard time learning.  I'm already in love with bitcoin and diving into the code is more and more interesting to me.  
Someone below suggested creating a simple multisig solution, that sounds like a very interesting project to figure out some initial problems.

This is fantastic - I will give CLTV a good look.  I will mess around with this.  
Didn't realize P2SH is a different type of address beginning with 3. 
Not being able to move the money until a set amount of time would be the best thing that could happen to me right now as I dig my way out of debt.  Thank you!

i also have this problem not accepting deposit
@_date: 2016-07-25 12:22:49
That is fantastic!  The job satisfaction of working with bitcoin must feel great!  Making money doing it and providing for yourself while gaining experience in the bitcoin and coding field.  If I can get on this path I'd be doing a lot better than I feel I'm doing now.  
So far I'm seeing Ruby, Javascript, and last Python.  
I'm wondering if you guys might have any tips on how to best learn?  Should I fully immerse myself in a language for a few weeks and just crash course myself with free online courses?  What's the best way to dive in and try and learn the basics pretty fast?
