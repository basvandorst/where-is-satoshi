I also expect it to be the first crypto to be cracked by Quantum computing coupled with deep learning AI. Can't say how long that will take of course, but I do expect since Bitcoin is the frontrunner for the foreseeable future attacks will be directed primarily it's way.

Food point thank you

Ty. That is helpful.

oh i'm not invested in crypto yet, just thinking about when best to hop in and what all that may entail in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:44:46
Ty, can anyone confirm that? I can't find the answer online myself. Details seem sketchy.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:51:57
Good point thank you

The main concern will be machine learning. If there is any pattern to hash algorithms deep learning will find it. Just a question of when. But the same AIs can develop even better ones.

I don't accept what he's saying is correct. I am only looking to understand WHY he said that time.  
It's unlikely he would pick a random time. So there will be reasons to justify that time and that's what I want to know. Even if you believe he is deluded, deluded people still have reasons for what they say.

What would it take for another coin to fully displace bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:04:25
It's not average people is expect to get involved in futures but already accredited experienced investors. It wouldn't take many to start pushing up the value of bitcoin. I keep wondering if average people who hold alts may sell them to buy more bitcoin just to ride rhe wave upward. I dunno...

I agree actually. Put on your helmets and buckle in your seatbelts, crypto fans!

So how long till a crash? Any guesses?
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:24:53
$10k by end of the year is almost guaranteed now. But will it crash afterwards lol?
