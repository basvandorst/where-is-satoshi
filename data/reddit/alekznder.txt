Possibly. Interesting to see if OP can find out.

[vault of satoshi]( Great Service. (1-2) Day Verification. Low volume but can send ltc/btc to other sites.
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:11:27
Yeah, they are reacting to the legal uncertainty.

At least these are actually a legitimate set of verification requirements.

Remember to hide the sign till you get in, sponsors might say [no no](

Good luck man. VOS confirmation happens in a matter of days. BTC-e can be weeks I hear. I literally took a pic of my drivers licence and was good to go within a few hours. Let me know how that goes though, been thinking of trying to get on a big exchange.
@_date: 2014-01-02 05:13:45
Hopefully y'all diversified and picked some up around 2$ on the 17th. Best gains so far in this bullish trend.
@_date: 2014-01-10 05:22:09
200+$ when? 
@_date: 2014-01-07 11:51:26
Man you used to at least used to bring good arguments to the table, now it's just reposts and hate. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:02:11
If guys you can make this exchange as cool as reddit and offer professional, secure and transparent service, you will become a very, very rich group of individuals. The world has spoken and we want open source, open book service. Reap what you sow :D  [hint: reddit style troll box]
@_date: 2014-02-13 01:19:57
Or you could just use [this](
@_date: 2014-01-05 14:23:08
Some people are still waking up to Zynga and the [Wall Street Journal]( article may have helped.
@_date: 2014-01-10 22:28:35
Hey thanks man! What goes around comes around. As long as your intentions are good you'll be rewarded.
@_date: 2014-02-02 07:28:37
Thank man this is actually helpful :)
So I have a token for bitfinex, if I lose my phone I can just somehow access it through gmail?
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:33:23
Unfollow and forget. Random guy spitting crap. Fontase? I doubt that, Fontase was cool, would love to the proof for that though. Cheers
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:23:47
why wouldn't they just transfer btc lol
@_date: 2014-03-07 22:31:09
See **r/vos**. This is legit, but has nothing to do with them being bankrupt. You should be thankful the exchange is vocal and not **risking** your money with undetermined regulation.
@_date: 2014-02-02 06:09:27
Hey man thanks for the reply,
Sorry to sound stupid but I don't really understand. If I lost my phone but needed to access a certain bitcoin exchange right away, what would be my best course of action?
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:04:47
just another support. more blunt it seems
@_date: 2014-02-23 08:21:04
FAKE. [ is the true account.
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:41:56
does btc.sx run in that building too?
@_date: 2014-01-01 03:14:02
There twitter feed:  says there looking into it. No changes to order book recently either so assuming no-ones getting on. It was good to go about 4hrs ago.
@_date: 2014-01-02 02:08:46
TBH man, they been very good with service for such a small company. Attending to a third-party error around midnight on new years and fixing the problem within the hour is pretty darn good. The market is young, don't gamble with which your not comfortable losing.
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:03:20
It hasn't been asked because some people took DYODD to heart and didn't throw their money into an unforseeable fate.
@_date: 2014-01-07 10:48:34
I feel like the people who need this are not going to find it on the sidebar. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 06:42:05
It's fine man, glad it's creating traction for you. If your not doing anything bad it'll begin to flow your way. The websites pretty nice, just not my thing tho
@_date: 2014-01-02 06:00:16
Well I know bter.com would let you do that for sure, as I am signed up there with no ID. Never used btc-e. Cheers
@_date: 2014-02-14 21:30:05
[Vault of Satoshi]( wasn't even affected by the whole scenario. Doing things right.
@_date: 2014-01-17 16:53:48
Recommend. Fast and safe. Low volume but you can move coins out if you want to trade elsewhere. Verification/deposit is fast. Free transfers @ r/vos for a month.
@_date: 2014-02-02 09:25:19
This is actually what I just did. Restarted the token and took a screen shot of the code and even tested the screenshot on another device. Should be perfect now :D 
Thanks to everybody who offered advice!
@_date: 2014-10-06 02:03:27
 Cry, cry a lot.
@_date: 2014-01-02 05:20:12
Oh well if you've already got BTC then for sure! Thought you were new to the scene. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 01:48:01

Vancouver is starting an atm string. Plus we already have one. We just need better exchanges.
@_date: 2013-12-28 13:10:55
Symptom of internet noobies
@_date: 2013-12-23 13:12:24

"Withdraw Fees: you only pay the fee we pay our bank. Bank Wires have to be a minimum of $1,000.00 and come with a bank fee of 0.2% (Minimum $25.00, Maximum $135) For any other amount you can request a check for free."
No idea on time frame, but great service, quick verification, very professional and seems quite safe. 2fa etc
Very low volume tho, sometimes you can snag a deal sometimes no one buys/sell. bigger spread usually.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:34:28
Is there anyway to help this cause? Vancouver here
