I love reading opposing views, but you're going to have to elaborate your argument a little more. Not just throw out words like "gamble" and "probably end with 0"

HTTPS is layer 7, MAC is layer 2 in TCP/IP. 
Unless I didn't understand the analogy, then I apologize in advance.

Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP

Well shit, I honestly couldn't tell you how it works, but I believe in it. I'm a network engineer, I configure routers and switched and firewalls for a living. but the basics of bits being transferred through electric signals over copper is still kind of fuzzy to me.

That was my mistake, I'm studying for a CCNP (Cisco Certification) so I'm on edge right now.

Quick question about coinbase. I've been on the BTC train for about 6 months, buying and HODLing, but I just realized that on the coinbase dashboard it's showing BTC @ 4078 but when you buy it's at 4099. Is it just a markup ?

in that case, carry on sir.

I've been wondering if BTC could be resized ? I'm not 100% sure that would be possible because of the core principals of bitcoin, but if mainstream adoption were to happen do you think people would have trouble dealing with fractions for most of their transactions, 
Imagine seeing a recipt.
- 0.0014511 - Milk
- 0.0012318 - Eggs
- 0.0001481 - Apples
- Tax = 0.0003574
Or would people still be using their native currency, but use BTC to convert to that currency ?

Im afraid not, as with anything, one day, something better than Crypto will come along, and many crypto bros will be resistant to it, but if there's enough support of something, it will live on untill the next best next thing.

I was hoping for this "dip" today so I could buy and of course coinbase is undergoing maintenance.

Just bought $300, I would like to work my way to 1 BTC My hopes are that I will forget about them in my coinbase wallet. In 5 years .. profit !

not really, I'm a windows sysadmin, and across from me are 4 Linux sys admins, their payroll is all in our (windows) files shares and unsecured. And none of them make as much as me. But I don't agree with OP, Linux has it's place in the infrastructure world and isn't going away any time soon.
