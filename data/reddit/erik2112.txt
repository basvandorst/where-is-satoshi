I don't sell, I just keep buying more.  Bought $500 worth last night, $500 a week ago and $500 2 weeks ago.  If it goes under $6k I might just buy $500 more.  No regrets because I'm confident in crypto tokens as currency and think that by the end of the year I'd be kicking myself for not buying when it was this low.  Others will obviously disagree with this method of buying.  All I know is when BTC was at $20k, all I saw was posts from people saying they wished BTC (or other token) would drop back down so they could buy some more.  Well, here is your chance.

You're not the only one, I tossed in $500 last night, $500 a week ago and $500 2 weeks ago.  Heck, if it does dip down below $6k I might just toss in another $500. I figure if I don't buy more while the price is down 70%, I'll be KICKIMG myself later this year.

That was funny

Agreed.  What this market needs now is a token to see mass-adoption for payments to jumpstart this beotch.  If it's not going to be BTC then it needs to be a different token.  It will not just rise on it's own now without real-world usage.

The same guy that was continually cracking jokes about a Trump run for the presidency.  We don't pay you to think, monkey now dance

I hate when people say, "It's currently over-valued", like any token has any current real world value besides speculation.  It's like, "oh yeah, what is the real value of BTC?". All I know is when BTC was at $20k everyone was wishing it would drop back down so they could buy some more.  Well, here it is.
