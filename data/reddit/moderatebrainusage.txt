What do you mean split? it's not a stock, it's money. It's divisible. 1BTC = 100 million satoshi.
I mean profits from investing in bitcoin, once everyone has bitcoin, you will not see such huge and fast gains. You only see them because it's high risk investment at the moment.

Is it better to have more or less BTC? If you think it’s better to have more than who cares if it’s higher price.

Why would you choose kraken for your exchange when you are in japan? Their website has one of the worst interfaces and it barely stays up. The number one most complained exchange on r/bitcoinmarkets is kraken. Also it has been removed from recommended exchanges.
Now, japan has some of the biggest exchanges by volume, bitFlyer etc. so why choose something that barely works? When I transfer money to bitFlyer I get them them on exchange same day. Do yourself a favour and remove your money from kraken as soon as you get it back.
And why would you use swift transfer too which is slow and cost you can extra in fees? They have bank account in japan the first and last time I’ve tried to use them, since they have no liquidity in yen and the fees are a lot higher than any Japanese exchange.

People with everything being too high risk attitude, will not see his rewards.
And who cares about +10%, if he really wants he can leave of credit card, then pay off the card when Bitcoin is on an upswing. Lots of ways to manage it, just need some smarts.

That’s because you are an early adopter. You can adopt bitcoin few years later once all this issues are resolved and bitcoin has 2-4% growth per year.

You don't get how OS development works. The only thing that's preventing core devs from continuing work on the fork (IF S2X fork is a success), is their egos and stubbornness.
Just check twitter, most of them behave like teenagers who were rejected or dumped by their first love.
If core and other side knew how to communicate, negotiate or even present a simple road map of development, we wouldn't have this current situation. Although those skills are very rare in CS/IT, that's why there's a lot of material written how to manage people in IT, since they are not the easiest people to get along.

No! The attack vector is before encryption. Since the computer was connected to internet it's already compromised with malware etc. unless people know what they are doing.

Hint, average block size != block weight.
Please read the thread again try to address the issue of saying they are the same thing. Now, saying segwit is 2MB and saying segwit2x is outright lies.

Have you looked at prices recently? an overpowerd PC is going to cost you less than $2k. You can get a 6 core CPU for $400 or 8 core i7-7820X for $600. Disk is dirt cheap. 2 x 8TB drives in RAID 1 or even RAID 5 config (can be easily expanded to more under linux) will cost $560.
My 3 year old PC is serving up 200 peers and sending GBs of data every day and it is 99% idle.
Edit: You can get drives cheaper as combos, $470.

I don't mind bigger blocks. And I agree it's rushed. And if there's a 2MB hardfork, I want better implementation with few other fixes thrown in, which will need longer timeframe to test it. Multisig would be one of them. Another issue is, I would want around 3-6months from the time software is released to allow nodes to deploy.
Who it is released? I don't cared it comes from core or someone else, I'm not a cheerleader, as long as the work is done correctly.

This needs to be said more and needs to be voted up. Reddit lacks any kind of EI. Most technical people from my experience of working in IT have zero EI. Seems the same is in bitcoin community. 
It's not that hard to acquire EI, there are lots of great books about it. The benefit of it are multiple, being able to understand another persons reasoning. Ability to get your own reasoning across and get the 3rd party to agree with you, and not by saying yes to you. But I'm truely following your ideology. It's equivalent of Jedi mind trick, but better.

I'm not saying I disagree with core (read, don't jump to conclusions). What I wrote in general has nothing to do with S2X, but it does apply to it. It's about the communication style.
Both side have continued the stubborn us vs them and we are at war attitude for how many years now? And we are seeing the results of split community.
Instead of trying to communicate the core roadmap, getting businesses on their side, they fling insults on twitter. Even in this thread luke-jr says that miners don't matter. I guess they do a little with the stuff that happen with BCH.
Core and most of reddit could start by picking up few books and educating themselves in how to speak to people without pissing them off and make enemies out of them. Since this is all that has happened.
It's human nature that if someone pisses them off, no matter how smart or great idea that is, the opposing party will try to get rid off you.
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:17:14
I'm not angry, I find it funny that the real reasons get ignored. People here can't have real adult discussion here, they can't negotiate or explain long term goals, plans and deadlines.
All I see is bunch of people flinging insults at each other on twitter. Some people need to rein in their egos, listen to what others have to say, raise and address their concerns. And learn how to talk and negotiate.
I think most people wouldn't be able to negotiate a deal with a paper bag.
Why did the split happen? Because all sides act like children. Few people who try to act like adults get drowned out by kids screaming and blaming others for their failures.
Now as a result we have fluctuating hashrate. Also now because devs don't want to negotiate with businesses or even try to sell them on their schedule or time line. After all, it's easier to insult them on twitter, since it's too hard to visit those businesses and have discussions with them.
We will have situation where 90% of the hashrate will leave in 2.5 months. Everyone ignores that and gets on a high horse saying how they are right. What will happen to the mempool then? Are we going to get angry and blame miners again for our failures? Are we going to learn anything from this or stay ignorant?

You can lose everything that you are lending if there's a margin call and the exchange can't sell it at a good price. It will happen if there's a massive drop in price. Which is likely to happen during the fork. As far as I'm concerned, you can lend out at 5% a day, but at the moment the risk of losing all of your BTC is a lot higher than normal. By the way, this risk is always present when margin lending.

As mentioned above. You might want to look into creating multisig wallet. Let's say 2 out of 3 or even better 3 out of 4. What it means that you only need 2 out of the 3 keys which have signed it or 3 keys out of the 4 private keys.
Then you could store the keys in safety deposit boxes in different locations that no one except you knows.

That's the whole point of nodes is they should run all the time, I don't even have that many peers, 100-140.
There is no better technology in BCH, it's cut down and has bigger blocks. And they miss one big issue with it, who controls money. They want control to be centralised in few powerful hands. Go watch "Inside Job", it shows what happens when money is controlled by few.
I don't know of a single person who wants to buy bitcoin to buy coffee. I'm in Japan (that's why I've amazing internet) and everyone here is buying bitcoin as a long term investment to get rich. And that's why big banks are coming soon, to get filthy rich too. They are not coming to buy coffee.
For me bitcoin is for storing my savings and keeping rich people's hands of them. That was the original purpose of it, not to buy coffee. There's even a message from Satoshi in genesis block:
It will make more sense after you watch Inside Job.

No it doesn't. They gave plenty of warnings telling users to withdraw their BTC if they wanted BCH and that they will not credit users BCH.
Also bitmex is a futures exchange, not spot. They only deal with BTC. They don't process any other type of payments.

With your attitude, I would have worse holiday and less bitcoin.
You can buy more bitcoin and have plans to spend it. You can buy back the bitcoin straightaway after spending it if you want to support merchants which support it.
Very often bitcoin merchants give a discount when using bitcoin, so it's a win win situation.
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:31:27
Also I don't recommend leaving your bitcoins on computer. Too many hacked and stolen bitcoin.
If you use iPhone, get a wallet for it. Since it has very secure running space and it would be very hard to leak information from it.
Another thing, if you want to leave it for few years and it's a large sum of money. Get a hardware wallet, trezor and ledger nano S are both good choices. I've both, personally I like trezor better, but nano S is cheaper.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:42:26
Current demand in BCH is because Bitmain sells their miners in BCH only and they released new batch of miners. Once that batch is sold out, expect BCH to take a dive again. I would sell before that happens. If you are not comfortable, you can sell 20-50%.
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:17:12

The fewer nodes there are, as it would be the case with bigger blocks, the more connections there are. Also do you trust those nodes? Do you trust your bank? What if banks decide to charge you more? With fewer nodes in hands of few rich people it doesn’t stop them from implementing any change they want. Look at PayPal, it used to be cheap.
Also a SPV client connects to multiple nodes and gets same date from all of them to compare it and make sure it didn’t connect to compromised node. As such for a node to matter on the network it needs to have influence, to have influence it needs to have a lot of connections.
Edit: r/btc goal is to have PayPal clone. But the goal of bitcoin isn’t PayPal.

If you haven't moved your coins to segwit address, you should.

@_date: 2017-11-12 02:49:23
It's not free, I'm paying now and I can handle a little more.
I disagree that mining and nodes should be centralised. It's already bad enough that mining is. Then the miners also centralise the nodes and bitcoin stop being what it was supposed to be.
It was shady parts of internet away from central controls. Once only business controls bitcoin, it also means that government controls. Because business never said or will say No to government. Check China and chinese bitcoin exchanges as an example.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:22:35
I think you have misunderstanding about how segwit works and how it increases capacity and how mempool works.
I will try to make it simple.
You have 100 people waiting for a bus, 8 of them are skinny (segwit) and other 92 are fat (standard transactions), they take up as much space as you 4 skinny people. The people are transactions and the queue is mempool.
Now, a bus arrives that can fit 10 fat people or 40 skinny people. Since the bus driver (miner) sees 100 people in the queue he starts an auction for the seats and whoever pays the most per seat, can get on the bus (block). In the end he might get 4 skinny people and 9 fat people. There will be still 87 people waiting in the queue and they are still willing to pay high prices to get on next bus.
In this scenario, the fees for the bus are going to be pretty high since there are lots of people who can't wait for next bus. Raising the price. The skinny people can bid at 1/4 of the price and still get in. But the overall price is higher.
Now imagine that roles are reversed, you have 100 skinny people and 10 fat ones. Same auction starts again, but since more people can get on the bus, the auction prices will be a lot lower. The bus might get 1 fat person and 36 skinny. There are now 63 people left and there's a less fee urgency.
To see the transactions and fees in mempool this website is pretty good:
But in the end, less SW transactions means the price will be higher.

You could also say it's the flickering light of hope at the end of the debt tunnel.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:49:39
So this is the current issue with the big blocks debate. Also it’s not about now, but 5 years time. While the block size will grow, network speeds will not keep up. That’s why there are methods to increase transaction throughout without increasing network usage, we should implement them. Once they are exhausted, we should increase blocksize. By the way, I’m not against big blocks. I want to see modest increase once we need it.
My current speed is 100/100Mb up and down. Speeds of up to 2Gbs for around $40-50 per month, but not in my building.

More of this, all millionaires go broke. As someone has mentioned before, get financial education, both of you. Seems like you are on the right track. Introduce her to the idea of having money and investing/saving it. Not just spending.
As another person, lawyer up, in case of your death or something.
Once you have discussed what she would do if she won a million dollars (after the education), introduce the money. slowly....
You don't have to introduce it all at once, you could say it's dividend from trading/investing in bitcoin. Once her mind frame is all about accumulating wealth instead of spending, she should start working with you on building up wealth.

With Bitcoin you get a fixed amount. There's no debt and there's no interest. In this case bitcoin behaves exactly like stocks, commodities or gold.

Yes, it is. It's the whole reason behind existence of bitcoin. To easily transfer it and move it around the world with no borders.
You can open and account and start reading about it and educating yourself.

I know how the points work (I live in tokyo), the 10% the points give makes it competitive with amazon. But if I can get another 13% off on top of it, than it's a lot better than the points I get from my credit card and for the first time it actually makes sense for me to spend some bitcoins.

I think your understanding of bitcoin is a bit off. Bitcoin doesn't need exchanges. It's only to convert to or from fiat.

Always save the private key. My assumption is that phones up to certain level of holdings are better than exchanges. Next step up is hardware wallet.

It's open source. It's upstream version of copay. And you can point it at any backend you want. You can use your own node. But you will have to install some extra software on it. I've not looked into this for more than a year. Also I didn't check how they implemented the bcash part.
I will keep using it, but it will require extra technical know how I'm getting it running on the fork of your choice. I would prefer if they supported all 3 forks out of the box.
EDIT: just had a quick look. You would have to install BWS instance on your node. Each wallet has its own BWS URL. If you are willing to run your own node and it runs in a public address, this whole debate is non-issue. Use what you like

That's pretty much what everyone was saying with half a brain, except the circle jerk here is strong and was repeating it's 4MB blockweight!!!! BLOCKWEIGHT!!!! I got tired of arguing with the mindless mob here. And if there's a fork it will be 8MB blockweight!!!
That's why there are still a lot of 2MB fork supporters, not part of the 2 circle jerk subredits here, since it's impossible to have any sort of discussion here.
Also I'm not interested in the current HF attempt. There's better way to do it and it should contain few more fixes to the protocol at the same time.

As someone who disagrees with u/Frogolocalypse and think he's a troll. He's right, most wallet have very bad fee estimation, it's outright broken.
In past 2 days 5-10 satoshi per byte transactions have been confirming within reasonable time and even some 0-5 satoshi per byte within few hours. There are some big spikes every now and then like 4 days ago. But they can be waited out when you only transact once a month like u/cangrejozurdo does.
Got to check the mempool to see what's going on.

I use bitflyer and they are biggest in Japan. They did support BCH within days, I was very surprised. It all depends how viable the fork is in their opinion. They have just released a statement about Bitcoin Gold:
I expect them to support both forks. But the tricky part will be what they will name them... How they will support etc... Lots of unanswered questions.
EDIT: Also they are very Japanese company, so they will keep quiet until the last minute when they make their final decision.

The price will fluctuate etc. might drop and be good buying opportunity. Just like all previous drops. If you move it to your own wallet, you will own coins on both chains/forks. If you aren't technical, it might be best to just wait for the dust to settle and then make a decision what to do with the lesser fork.
I'm technical and that's my plan too.
For roughly what will happen you can look into BCH/bcash/bitcoin cash. But it's impossible to be 100% certain how market will react this time.

He way over payed. Copay is broken, at the moment mempool isn't even busy, he should have paid 10-15satoshi per byte. Which works out for most common transaction type to only need 10-15cent fee. If he felt generous he should have paid 25cents.
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:09:49
I"m sorry, but 99.999% people involved in bitcoin and crypto know barely anything about computers, IT and especially security. Playing video games and reinstalling windows or updating your patches doesn't mean you know security.
Even big companies with lots of IT security experts mess up since bad behaviours sleep through the cracks. I had here people argue with me that their security measures of obfuscating private keys as jpegs and kept on dropbox are good security practices.
Unless you have years of expertise in that filed, get yourself a hardware wallet, which is a shortcut, but it needs you to learn about best practices when using one too. But you will have to learn a lot less to be secure.
Do you know what bugtraq or security focus are? No? Get hardware wallet.

Feels go up and down, just like price. Sometimes it's 10cents and other times it's closer to a $1. My last few transactions over last couple of weeks were in 10-25 cent range. The biggest issue with fees are the wallet fee estimators and I think it's one of the things that needs to be addressed really soon as the amount of usage grows.

The issue is the wallet or in this case exchange.
Exchanges overcharge, since they want to make their transactions priority, so people don't file tickets.
This one was sent from a trezor, it's a segwit transaction. And the cost is evaluated on the size of the transaction. The size of the transaction will depend on how many inputs you have.
If you want to make smaller payments, move your coins off an exchange into a wallet you control, also make sure it's to a segwit address to take advantage of the savings on fees. I highly recommend trezor, ledger nano S is popular too. Both support Segwit transactions which are cheaper.
I buy my bitcions monthly, whenever I estimate I bought enough, I move all of them at the same time to my wallet.
The best way to check the current state of mempool and what fee per byte to set is this 
Currently as of time I'm writing this, I would set my fee around 12-17 satoshi per byte for decent fast confirmation. Or around 7-8 if I don't mind waiting.
One of my pet projects (when I've enough time to seat down and think it through/code it) is to write a better fee estimator.

I guess you don't live in japan. Usually overseas wire transfer takes 5 business days.
The exchanges in japan will only deposit fiat to a local bank that you have signed up with. That's for bitFlyer and quoine.
To have a bank account in japan you need to be a  resident. Also recently thanks to the new regulations, exchanges have to make sure that the people have to reside in japan. I had a registered post card sent to me to confirm it. So the only way to do it is know someone who lives in japan.

It's kind of a nuclear option. I would say we don't want an all out war at the moment, since there would be casualties on both sides. At the moment it's more like Cold War arms race. Let's see which side will collapse.

I agree, do what you need, not what you want. Small apartment is fine. Enjoy minimalist living. Bitcoins will appreciate faster. Put more savings into bitcoins. Even if you go travelling and use bitcoins, top them back app. Travel overseas to get some perspective on this world.

Think long term and be a minimalist.

Miners have an option of going on strike action. I'm saying they have to evolve to stay relevant. Just like they have to keep buying new hardware to do it. Just like companies make new asic etc. It's an evolving business and change happens all the time. Profits are not guaranteed. Either because of coin prices, difficulty levels, power costs and lot more variables at play.
Most of all. If there's no demand for miners in one job, they will need to adapt and find new jobs. It's either mine on chain with more economy or closing business. In the car driver example, it's not great making your income by driving a car when cars will not have a steering wheel or even a driver seat.

I got a trezor, it was a tough choice between it and ledger nano s.
I got a trezor since it allowed me to improve my security everywhere, not only of my bitcoins. U2F for 2 factor authentication (supported on ledger too), just wish more websites supported this.
Password management, still in beta, but I like it.
GPG and SSH, I work with Linux etc, and use ssh throughout the day. I think also supported by ledger.
I was also thinking about holding out for ledger 2. But it looks like it will be bigger.

As someone who uses bitflyer, it had no fees trading forever. They have introduced fees for a short period and removed them again. They do it once in a while.
Also since the new laws came in, I had to confirm that I'm not only Japanese resident, but also that I'm located here. Until I did, my account was blocked.
A lot of institutions are interested here in bitcoin, they are seating on a lot of money. Not to mention a lot of small businesses have interest in it, since japan is cash society and they don't like credit cards. Bitcoin is perfect for japan.
I hope that this trend stays up, since in 2 months I've to drop some serious coin on some white goods at bic camera and paying with bitcoin I don't have to pay sells tax and there are some heavy discounts. It's way better than using credit card and their points.

With pib91 a reorg will happen when a miner mines a block which doesn't signal bit1. Then all hell will break loose with transactions being lost etc. That's why exchanges prefer to halt transaction during this time to prevent losing money.
Imagine if you accept BTC, get 6 confirmations, it all looks good. the BTC gets sold for fiat money. But that was invalid chain according to bip91, so a reorg will happen. Because of the reorg you suddenly don't have the BTC, which you have already sold. And so you as a business are out of pocket.
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:03:50
I see the usual suspect comes out spreading the loaded FUD. Great job once again! Zero logic as always, lots of big words and propaganda.
Unfortunately, I'm sorry to tell you that's not how bitcoin network works. Nodes aren't everything, economic nodes on the other hand are. That's the ones that have users.
If the 10s of thousands of nodes don't follow economic majority, they will be no different then BCC. If they don't have any mining hash power behind the chain they are on, they will just seat there doing nothing.
@_date: 2017-07-14 09:53:55
As others have explained. It's not. UASF has 0.3% hash rate. It needs explicit mining/support.
Segwit signalling miners will keep mining none segwit blocks. Because of that UASF is not a threat. It will take 3.5 years for that chain before it mines blocks at correct rate. At which point it will be so far behind in PoW it will never be a threat.
Another issue that for a miner to mine that chain is simply insane. If a miner gets a block, they have to wait for 100 confirmations to be able to spend the block reward. That's 200days! They will seriously be bleeding money.
Be careful of all the FUD here. There's a lot of mob mentality here. But nobody checks the math.

I would also add to it, a lot of the devs lack communication skills.

Anyway, I'm not religious about anything. But I don't like the stunts used by bip148 just like I don't like the bullshit that BU was and just as I don't like what is happening to segwit2x in last few days. The HF part could have been half decent and now it's getting worse.

It definitely is. Misleading advertising, but it was pretty frustrating, especially with my subpar Japanese.
But to add to the confusion there was news here recently that in japan there's no sales tax on bitcoin purchases. Unless there was something lost in translation.

@_date: 2017-05-23 14:39:38
Hopefully soon enough we can, RSK is coming out for plebs like us. But think of using liquid when you want to move millions. But in my opinion LN is superior to RSK and hopefully we can have that too.
There's more new tech coming soon if segwit activates. Schnorr signatures, mimblewimble and LN are the ones I'm mostly looking forward too.

As mentioned, you will have the same amount of bitcoin, always. The $ figure doesn't matter.
But the correct formula would be BTC x Current price. So 0.19 x 1600 = $304
If one BTC is worth $1000, you will have $190

You should use terminology correctly and not spread misinformation.
SegWit increases block weight to 4MB. And SegWit2x doubles it to 8MB.
Block weight doesn't equal block size. The average blocks you will see from SW if everyone uses it, is 1.9-2.1MB blocks. SW2x will double that to 3.8-4.2MB on average.

Spot on, I've been making living of linux for 21 years and the drama gets old. Lots of small territorial battles. Even some major figures retiring because of it from developing on linux and you know what? Life goes on.
Major corporations stepped in and life still goes on. And the bitcoin community has more drama queens than linux community. Lots of people get their panties in a knot here.
And for those who don't know, that's how open source development should work. People improve other people's code, by the people who are interested in doing so.  And most of the people who do it, are total a-holes, who are next to impossible to deal with.
There's way too much hero worshiping going on here. All humans are fallible.

And what's the incentive for miners to mine bip148? They will not be able to spend their mined bitcoin for 200 days. Not that there will be lots of blocks discovered in first place. By the way, 200 days is 6.5 months. Most miners will drop out since they will be losing money. Since at the moment it takes 2/3rd of a day before they can spend it.
No exchanges supports bip148 either. So after half a year of waiting. They can't get cash for it either...
Don't forget miners have to pay electricity bills, warehouse etc. otherwise they go bankrupt. Waiting half a year to redeem 12.5btc is a joke.
If bip148 had 30% hash power we could talk. But it's 100x less.
In summary, miners are out to make money. They are not religious fanatics. That's how the system was designed to work.
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:36:10
Most wallet are SPV clients and they will not be aware of the fork. They will have to connect to a node(s) which on the HF chain. The wallet has to support creating SW transactions, if the wallet doesn't and at the moment none do, we will not see any SW transactions.
As an example, at the moment SW transactions are a minority on LTC.

If every transaction is to a SW address, than it will roughly double. If no one uses SW addresses, then some p2sh addresses will see a boos, other wise it's minimal.
So to see the doubling of capacity increase, wallets and people would have to start using SW addresses.
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:01:26
I hope you are aware that most of the exchanges halted withdrawals and deposits of bitcoins due to bip91. I know all of the ones in Japan did.

@_date: 2017-06-06 15:00:07
I'm 100% aware of the miners. That's why I was supporting it in the beginning. But I don't have to stoop down to their level. I'm all for bip149 or swgwit2x if it ever comes out. As long as things get moving. But in my opinion in regards to bip148 and it's personal one. The community took something that could have been great and took a wrong turn someplace.

I couldn't agree more with you and I'm surprised you are the only one who noticed it. Instead of raising an angry mob with pitchforks, why doesn't Luke and others here take a lesson out of Barry Silbert's approach and go talk to people and businesses? A vocal minority, doesn't make a majority.
And yes, I'm all for UASF and segwit, but I'm siding with core devs (and I've more respect for them). It has failed to gather support and the timeline is unrealistic. So get off your soapboxes and start doing some real legwork if you want it to be successful.
Saying all that, blackmailing people while holding a gun to their heads is not how support is built, but usually how people will turn against you.

I believe that the elects you speak of are like cancer. And bitcoin will be able to survive them and become stronger as a result of it.

It looks like you don't know how bitcoin works. SPV Wallets don't care about HF, as long as they connect to a node which is on a HF, they will work with Segwit2x. But they cannot make any segwit transactions. Not to mention most of the new customers will use wallets like bitflyer, coinbase or korbit etc...
Before you repeat the same thing over and over again thinking that it will become true, educate yourself. I recommend reading mastering bitcoin. It will teach you how it works.
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:12:36
Segwit doesn't bring us to 4MB. That's FUD, even luke-jr calculated it and average was 1.9-2.1MB. You have been listening to too many emotionally charged trolls and not checking your facts. There's a lot of propaganda in this sub since UASF started.
Most of all, not all transactions will be segwit and after HF you will be looking at 3-4MB blocks tops.

First of all, why do people run bitcoin wallets on their PCs? They are insecure, and it doesn't matter if it's windows, mac or linux. They all have vulnerabilities that will be discovered in the future and they will be exploited.
If you want to have your bitcoins secure, keep it on a device that's as lock down as possible and mostly useless for anything else. Better than any PC is a smartphone. Get an android or even better iPhone (less customization = less bugs, smaller attack surface).
Even more secure get a hardware wallet, although I think most people own smartphones, so why use a PC/laptop is beyond me. It's just begging hackers out there to take your money.

This is simply incorrect. Lightning has limits, at least initially and it will not do what you are saying it will.
For me the current limits are too low to do any sensible size transaction. I can't even pay for a dinner with friends or amazon order (at least in 1st world countries, 3rd world the limits are more acceptable).
In my opinion this limits, when people find them out will limit the adoption by users. As such it will also limit creation of LN nodes and as such merchants using LN.
For me to adopt LN, I would want to be able to fund a channel with at least 1BTC and minimum transaction size I would want to be lifted to a minimum of $250.

You are right, I've confused you with someone else. The person who linked to that block, but he ignored he comments. There's a lot of FUD and alternative facts everywhere now. Looks like American presidential elections.
I've posted this in my previous comments about that block.
Make sure you take every fact with grain of salt and evaluate it yourself.
I don't expect wallets to ad support for segwit for a while. Or people start using segwit addresses for that matter. The growth will be slow. Even with the hard fork I don't expect blocks bigger that 3MB.
There are a lot of old wallets etc. and I'm sure you have read the thread about dark net mixers creating most of the transactions and fee pressure. I don't expect them to upgrade to segwit any time soon...
@_date: 2017-06-22 04:52:05
Sounds like the poor Egyptians can run a node, but they will not be able to use them, since they can't afford the fees. To me it doesn't sound like any Egyptian would care about running a node for something that it's no use to them.

In theory, in reality they will be between 2 to 4MB. In reality not everyone will use SW transactions, due to old software etc... also only few rare transactions could hit something around 8mb. And they will be hard to come by in real world.

I agree with your analysis, but you are forgetting that not only the segwit camp is split in regards to the hard fork.
The former BU camp has die hard anti-segwit camp and they want to fork their own segwit free bitcoin if segwit activates. Worst case we will end up with 3 chains.

Are you 5 or something? Seems to be the only decent bitcoin news service which reports about bitcoin/crypto news and adoption. And if you have issues with Roger Ver, instead of calling him names behind his back (that's sooo 1337), why don't you grow a pair, learn how to talk to people and persuade them and talk to him instead.
I had scrolled through last few days of their news and I can't see them pushing any of Roger's agendas. Of course, this is only the news.bitcoin.com, the rest of the bitcoin.com does push an agenda.
PS: not a fan of roger, but one day you got to learn how to behave like an adult.

If a company is smart, they will hedge any potential risks and new world orders.
Take Kodak as an example. But Kodak failed to adopt to new world order, they even tried to destroy it.
On the other hand take Fuji, they still make and sell film and products derived from it. But they have adjusted production according to sales. They have also expanded their other business areas to compensate for lost revenue.
Tell me, which company was smarter? The one that hedged its future on some digital technology or one that tried to undermine it?
The history is littered with similar examples.

I'm interested in bitcoin being a success, not only it being a cockroach and being immune to a nuke attack.
I'm not interested in bitcoin becoming Diva's play thing, be it developer, or miner or some personality. I'm getting tired of all the Diva's around here saying they will hold all of us hostage to their forks. Which is equivalent of them taking the ball and going home.
First of all, I want them to learn how to communicate, stop throwing tantrums and insults at each other on twitter like kids do. Grow up and start working together and pursued other people if they think bitcoin needs to take a different turn.
Start acting like adults, but it seems the bitcoin community is influenced by American style politics. Where it's easier to paint others as evildoers and we have to declare war on them.
This pretty much describes everyone on both forums: 
There's very few people who try to bridge the divide and move things forward.

I use trezor and few others mobile wallets, used and tried others. Have you tried using trezor's segwit on LTC?
Bitflyer, coinbase and korbit are wallets on exchanges. We were talking mobile apps and web wallets.
You are confusing the issue. If exchange/web wallet upgrades a wallet for a user, it's transparent. If a user doesn't upgrade the software like samurai, then it doesn't matter if a new version exists which supports it.
Most users don't upgrade their software, how many posts this forum got in the past from some user who didn't upgrade their wallet and had bad fee calculations. I guess this upgrade issue is only familiar to people who work in IT.

I hope you realise that you sound religious spreading your dogma. Saying things like JihanCoin doesn't help.
Slow and independent bitcoin with 1 or 2 blocks a day? When will be the next difficulty retargeting? Seems to me you don't know how bitcoin works.
If UASF had exchanges behind it, it would be relevant, but because of the dogma, name calling etc, no relevant businesses got behind the movement.
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:25:01
It is. I would be more than tempted to keep it.
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:54:57
That's a good insult? Hahahaha
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:59:31
Don't spread fud and propaganda. Right now it looks like UASF will fail and that side will lose coins.
Anyway, if you don't move coins after that date, nothing changes for you. That's the reality of it. If you need to move coins wait few days to see if UASF succeeds or fails.
With bitpay, if they don't implement multiple backends, you can import your private key into trezor. It will support multiple backends and it will lets you perform transaction on any chain you want. There will be other wallets that allow you to do it.
In my opinion best thing is to wait it out, see what happens.
The other options are:
Move your coins to exchange before the split and sell them. Buy them back after it's all over.
Option 3: after the split move the coins off the fork you don't like to exchange and sell them. As long as any exchange supports them. And hope that your decision was correct. There will be a lot of people spreading fud and do this to make sure lots of newbies sell their coins cheap. So they can pick them up at a heavy discount. My recommendation is not to fall for the fud of a vocal minority.

A value of a variable doesn't make a block size. The only block which has approached 4MB on testnet is full of transaction which will never be seen on main net. Look at my comment history, I'm too tired in reposting it. Too much misinformation/fud/alternative facts everywhere

@_date: 2017-06-30 08:42:49
Here's some math to prove that the miners will be losing lots of money if they mine UASF. I'm using stats from here:
As I'm writing this, slushpool has total of 5.4% mining power. of that, only 5.51% supports UASF. In this case when rounded up, a total of 0.3% total hash supports UASF.
Now, there are 144 blocks per day. 0.3% of 144 is 0.432 blocks per day. So the user activated soft fork will discover 1 block every 2 days. Now, miners need 100 confirmations before they can spend their freshly mined bitcoins. Normally it's nearly 2/3rd of a day. But at that rate, it will be 7months before they can spend their new bitcoin.
That's not all! Difficulty retargeting is every 2016 blocks. that's nearly 3 years and 3 months before UASF can mine 144 blocks per day again.
Frankly, I don't think anyone has to worry about it, unless some exchanges and more miners get behind it. At this hash rate, I don't see any exchanges using it, since it might take a month or years before someone gets their sent bitcoins. Even if they pay top fee, you will get the payment in a day or 2. Imagine if you have to wait 3 years to get the bitcoin that normally takes few days now.
@_date: 2017-06-23 08:42:12
Let's not assume and look at real data. Segwit will roughly double the transactions and Segwit2x will double that again. The result will be 4x transactions.
Currently bitcoin can process 3.5 transactions per second. End result will be 7tx/s with Segwit and 14tx/s after Segwit2x hard fork.

I think you must have miscalculated something. Or just been reading into a lot of FUD and the propaganda. Show me the 4MB blocks on testnet. In reality they are around 1.9-2.1MB blocks. After HF they will double leading to 3.8-4.2MB blocks.
If you are going to continue with the 8MB FUD. Show me all the 4MB blocks on testnet. Not some theoretical possibility.
@_date: 2017-06-21 05:11:12
The last part maybe came out a little too strong. But normally when trying to pursued people, it's good to send a consistent message.
As for autoupdate, I live in Japan. I'm yet to see people update their software on their phones. All my partner's phone apps are out of date. Because that's good enough...
My phone also doesn't autoupdate, a lot of apps will add advertising/spam once they become popular. That's why people disable it, good eg. last version of mycelium.
@_date: 2017-06-22 03:40:42
If you don't care how long it takes to start a channel, you can use a low fee. With segwit the channel will be autorenewed at no cost. Only once you want any of the locked bitcoins back, you will need to do 2nd transaction on chain to close the channel. If you are not in a rush. This can also be a low fee.
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:15:10
There are protocols on top of tcp/ip, http for example gave way to http/2 which in turn is based on spdy. All of these protocols are also compressed by gzip to reduce the payloads. Compression for videos and images has improved too. OS which use tcp/ip also got better too. It’s more than just hardware.

I've just checked, ETH today has transferred twice the value of bitcoin. and it's 2nd day in the row. The market cap doesn't matter as much. ETH is getting double the real world use compared to BTC.
All the people, core devs, miners, twitter personalities need to fucken wake up and realise that they are not the sun and the universe doesn't revolve around their egos.
And LTC is on the heels of BTC, with 30% of BTC's volume.
EDIT: My mistake, ETH has transferred 4.37 times as much value in last 24hours compared to bitcoin. And bitcoin never came close to it. That's the real world out there...
People need to check in their egos in at the door and start fixing this.

@_date: 2017-06-20 15:56:14
And UASF didn't do the same thing to exchanges and miners. It was do as we say or else. And which one came first?
By the way, I'm a former UASFer, who got tired of the FUD and propaganda campaign. I don't want to be part of any such movement.
I want segwit and lightning. The HF part I will evaluate it when it arrives and take it (or not) on merit instead of charged emotions. In the mean time I will work on getting concrete facts out there so people can make their own independent choices.
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:05:43
It would be good to see some stats, broken up by region too.
It would be even better if there was a way to depreciate applications and force people to upgrade. Currently there's no such system, for good reason too, since it would be open to abuse.
For now I don't expect segwit to be fully transparent either. I use trezor and the way they implemented segwit on LTC is very confusing to a casual user.

I would say 99%+ of the millions of $$$ of transactions everyday are not by the radical reddit users. Most of them scream hodl and never transact. And most of all they are willing to throw under the bus the users who do transact and make it valuable.
In my opinion it could be a worse disaster than DAO. You are risking businesses' and people'a money, because you are not willing to negotiate and all you want is to preach to people.
In my opinion if UASF happens and transactions get rolled back. Bitcoin will lose and never recover. ETH will take its place.
And all thanks to a righteous minority. I ran a bip148 node until yesterday and switched back to core. Because I believed the scenario would have played out differently. We would have Luke and others to meet exchanges, wallets etc to strike an agreement with them.
Instead I see a bitcoin ISIS forming and everyone has to obey their sharia law or they get shot. I will pass and I don't want to be associated with people like that.

I agree with you on every point you have raised. And I've already reverted my node from UASF to a plain vanilla core.
On my peer list I see 1 node with uacomment and only 1 UASF0.3 node.
As far as I can see there's no economic support. The only support is from very loud and now very annoying minority who is mostly pushing FUD and propaganda instead of facts. And when confronted with any actual facts, they turn into 6 years olds slining profanity etc, since they don't have any arguments.

I will also add that I'm cool with it, but I'm still in wait and see mode of what actually gets delivered.
First of all, it seems that Jeff is really bad at communicating. Might be because of the tight deadlines and him not having a lot of time to do it. But who really knows.
For now, I'm 100% for the segwit activation using bit 1 and 4. And seems like the markets are responding in a very positive way to it too.
I'm still 50/50 on the HF part until I see it.
Also I'm against all the FUD that has been spreading on this forum about it. Instead of spreading propaganda and thumping your chests (is it an american thing?), seat down, think it through and make a decision about it.
As far as I can see, a lot of people in the centre are lukewarm towards the proposal. The biggest objection is the activation of HF in 3 months time, not giving nodes enough time to upgrade and I 100% agree with this, but it's yet to be seen what happens.

I wouldn't worry too much about the hardfork. Like others have mentioned. Certain events are already priced in.
For example with the latest segwit2x activity, bitcoin spiked a little while alts went down.
The hardfork will either succeed or fail. If it succeeds I'm sure the price will spike. If it fails, there might be short term dip and worth buying more coin.
These type of events happen every few months. So most people don't worry about them and just take advantage of the opportunities.

In real life, even according to your previous analysis, segwit blocks are around 1.9-2.1MB. So segwit2x will be double that which will result in 3.8-4.2MB blocks. Even then, I don't expect we will see migration to segwit capable wallets any time soon. Especially from majority of users who don't hangout on reddit.
Also majority of users don't upgrade their software either.
Also please stay consistent with your facts. Don't quote different parameters/variables depending which ones suits your agendas at a time.

If your strategy pays off, you will get more coins. If it doesn't. You will have less.
With TmeatMan's strategy, he will never end up with less coin than he has now. But if the price does go lower, his reward will be a lot less than yours.
