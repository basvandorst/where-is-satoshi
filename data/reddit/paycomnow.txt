Somehow I think there is more to this story, what she claims and what really happened, I wouldn't be surprised if we'll findout  it was a theft but she has some weird photos with the "victims" and they don't want to press charges

Even if his miners were returned by the custom officials and even with their no return policy only a Scam would take the money and keep the products.
What kind of no refunds policy is this? Keep the money and the products? If the buyer didn't received the products then the seller must refund, maybe deducting the shipping costs but the products cost would be refunded by any serious company.

I think he's referring to pdf invoices (scanned copies of original document issued by the company), the electronic ones maybe are not accepted in his country. I mean who knows how a Bitmain electronicinvoices looks, if it's a message showing the price in cryptocurrency and the customs officials have a price in usd that could be a problem they would think is something bad with that shipment.
