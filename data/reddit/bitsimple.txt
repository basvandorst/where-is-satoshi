What if the merchant gives you a better price.  It is just starting but expect it to become more common.
Many gold shops (not reddit gold but the shiny metal) charge 3% more to use CC than they do for bank wire.  Bitcoin beats both, fast and cheaper.
Overstock announced a 1% "cash back" program for Bitcoin purchases.
As merchants realize Bitcoin costs them less (both in swipe fees and fraud) the smart ones will leverage that with lower prices. 
The reason CC fees are "baked in the price" is that until recently for online purchases there was no other option.  You aren't going to pay cash online so it was simply an accepted cost of doing business.  Now it isn't a required cost.

The point is you don't need to trust Satoshi.  If Bitcoin required implicit trust in Satoshi it would be essentially worthless.   Bitcoin was designed to be a system which allows two parties to engage in a transaction without the need of a trusted third party.

Who said anything about hoarding.  Don't KEEP your coins on an exchange.  It isn't a bank account.  It isn't insured.   Buy coins, sell coins, spend coins, get paid in coins ... but don't keep them on an exchange or you don't have any bitcoins.  You have an IOU for so many bitcoins.  In the case of MtGox it looks like those IOUs will not be paid.  Real bitcoins (i.e the ones you hold the private key for) you never have to worry about not "being paid".

Try using cash online.   If a merchant is saving 3% using Bitcoin then offering a 1% discount (or 1% bonus depending on how they want to structure it) is a win-win.  Merchant comes out ahead, customer comes out ahead.
For digital goods the true cost of CC is closer to 5% to 10% so 3% was being conservative when you consider the tx fee, the discount rate,  the losses due to fraud, the chargeback fees, the anti-fraud technology fees, etc.

Transactions outputs of less than 5,430 satoshis are considered non-standard and aren't relayed by most nodes or included in blocks by most miners.
By successful do you mean it was included in a block? If not then blockchain.info just let you "successfully" get your coins stuck which is what the other wallets are trying to protect you from.
Nothing prevents you from either modifying bitcoin-qt or paying someone to do it and removing the restrictions.  It then will be able to let you get transactions stuck as good as any other wallet.

Roughly ten minutes later a miner finds block 6,930,000.  For the four years prior to that the subsidy will be 1 satoshi per block.  I don't think the subsidy going from 1 satoshi to 0 satoshis will be a huge shock.  Do you?  
The good news is it means Satoshi's hypothesis was correct and transaction fees and the network size scaled up nicely to offset the declining subsidy for more than a century.  If it hadn't the network would have failed a long time before 2140.
@_date: 2014-02-24 19:49:36
In the last 10,000 blocks the average tx fee reward was 0.2 BTC per block.  The subsidy was 25 BTC.    So we are talking about 25.2 BTC vs 25.1 BTC.
Of course miners are free to included (and by definition exclude) any transaction they see fit so miners can continue to require 10,000 satoshis or more in fees per KB.

Exactly. BitPay will get better (and so will the host of competitors which come along).
With the limited details provided bitcoin the protocol worked fine.  The poor user experience was either due to BitPay's service going down or the merchant wasn't educated well enough that they don't need to require 6 confirmations for a cup of soup (and requiring it is going to drive away business).
Either way it is something that can be improved over time.

If you are willing provide the tx ids of the transactions in question it can allow people to provide you a specific answer
A couple general concepts to consider:
- The min fee is being reduced by 10x in the next version so $0.30 will be more like $0.03.
- Bitcoin is never going to be optimal for tiny amounts.  That being said you would pay more in fees with just about any other electronic payment method.
- Fees are by the size (not value) of the transaction.  You are paying for space in a block.  So a $100 tx may be the same or less in fees (even free in some cases).
- The size of your transaction will depend on the value of the unspent outputs you have available to spend.  If you have received lots of tiny dust then using them in a transaction is going to result in a larger size for the same amount.  The fiat equivalent would be the difference between receiving a $100 bill or receiving 10,000 single pennies as a payment.  To pay someone with the latter would now would be rather burdensome.
- If your client is out of date then upgrade.  Minimum transaction fees (in BTC terms) for relaying have steadily declined however if your client is older it won't know that and will ask you to pay more than you need.

That is the concept of floating fees.  In the future (v0.10 or later) your client will look at the most recent block sizes, currently unconfirmed txs, and give you a recommended fee.
Automating it today is a little annoying because outside of rawtxs none of the RPC calls support setting the tx fee on a per tx basis.  That being said I have found that paying a fee of 1 satoshi over the current minimum works very well (i.e. 0.00010001 BTC).  Put you right at the top of the memory pool.

2FA (or 3FA) is not a magic bullet.  If your systems are so compromised that an attacker has your username, password, and OTP code from your secondary device what are the odds your email isn't also compromised?
2FA is a great idea but it can also lead to complacency.  There are a lot of attack vectors which a 2FA system can't protect from.  One example would be an infected machine.  The malware can simply wait until you login, then session jack the session and steal funds that way.

Are you new to Bitcoin?  If so he may be counting on your inexperience to lead you to trust him or do something foolish.  If you use your own wallet on your own hardware, verify it over your own internet (cellular) connectivity and don't hand over the funds until you have a confirmation then it would be very hard to scam you.
If you let him "help you out" and give him access to his phone, or connect using his internet, or "Verify" the bitcoins were sent based on what his computer shows or countless other things noobs would do which breaks the 
"trust nobody and independently verify" nature of bitcoin, then yeah it would be trivially easy to sell you some air for $296.

That is the category that FinCEN has classified bitcoin exchangers.  There are only 7 categories of MSBs.  FinCEN didn't create a new special Bitcoin seller category.  They classified bitcoin exchangers/buyers/sellers AS money transmitters.   Every requirement that apply to "traditional" money transmitters applies to bitcoin exchangers.  No third party is required.  Please don't try to apply common sense to laws and regulations, that is a good way to end up in prison.   Read EXACTLY what the regulators write.  From FinCEN's guidance on virtual currency.
"An administrator or exchanger that (1) accepts and transmits a convertible virtual currency or (2) buys or sells convertible virtual currency for any reason is a money transmitter under FinCEN's regulations, unless a limitation to or exemption from the definition applies to the person"

It makes about as much sense as an ATM machine that has a **[cash didn't dispense please dispense more]** button and not only can you press it to get more money, you can continue to do so until all the money in the ATM is gone.
Even outside of mutable tx ids, a user reporting a transaction you created and recorded "doesn't exist" is considered a "notable event" by any competent programmer.  In normal operation it should happen exactly zero times so any number of times greater than zero would be abnormal operation.   Talk to as many developers as you want and ask how many of them would ignore abnormal operation involving money and dispense away.  It isn't that is is bad programming it is nonsensical programming, and doesn't pass the common sense test.  Just like the "more money" button on an ATM it wouldn't occur to any developer to design the code that way.  
I mean stop and think for a second.  It would had to occur to someone that dispensing money you believe you already dispensed without any sort of human verification was a "good idea".  Now this doesn't mean you might never need to dispense again but who would think "I think I paid but this says I didn't so lets just keep paying until it looks like I did" would be a good design.  I mean what problem could that sort of code solve?  What scenario would exist where it would even make sense to do that?
Generally speaking you kinda want to log "strange weird ass shit" (technical term).  If multiple "strange weird ass shit"s are occurring a short period of time you probably just want to take the site offline and investigate.  I mean even if you aren't being actively robbed it means you have some of bug/flaw in your system and I don't know about you but "*flaws involving the dispensing of irreversible money*" are the highest priority for me.

I am not saying a decentralized system is superior (although I obviously believe that) I am saying incurring the cost of decentralization in a centralized system is utterly pointless.  The blockchain has significant and real costs.  It also has limitations in transaction volume and security.  We accept these costs and limitations because there is no other way (yet? ) to transaction without a central authority.  The entire premise of bitcoin (and similar systems) is to remove the trusted central authority.
If you have a trusted central authority, you don't need a distributed decentralized network.  Bolting one on as an afterthought is pointless.  A single low end server could maintain the bitcoin ledger and process transactions many magnitudes more transactions than our entire current network.
In other words there is nothing wrong with the fed if they are perfect decision makers, have access to perfect information and are incorruptible.  If you have that you don't need Bitcoin, and if you don't you are a fool to have them as your trusted central authority.

Nodes only enforce the min relay fee rules on low priority txs.  Based on the value of the transaction, the age of the coins, and the tx size (in bytes) it is possible the transaction was "high priority" and in that case the minimum fee is 0 BTC (and always has been).
The purpose of the min relay fees is to make it more expensive for an attacker to pull off a flooding attack.   This type of attack is only economical for transactions with certain characteristics (namely large tx size, low value, and young coins) thus the rules to prevent it are only imposed on those transactions.
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:47:33
Well you have four  so.
First 
Not all transactions require confirmation.  If a bar is accepting funds from a NFC card with just a tap and no signature or pin then they ARE losing some funds to cc thieves.  That is a guarantee.  The bar stays in business because the profit margin on drinks is high and the amount of fraud is low.
The bar likely could operate just fine accepting zero confirmation transactions.  Bitcoin is new they likely are overestimating the security they need (while at the same time understimating the risk from CC because they are "known").  There is no one solution but the idea that a $3 muffin requires million dollar wire transfer security is silly.  Can a business require it?  Sure.  They also could have you fill out a muffin PO form, make a photo of your ID and CC, and ask you to come back in 180 days to pickup your muffin once there is no risk of chargeback.  They don't because the goal isn't zero fraud, it is maximum net revenue.
Second 
People aren't Bitcoin.  People are mean regarding just about any topic imaginable from the holocaust to the special olympics.  I feel sorry for the victims of MtGox fraud however the reality is that many people were not going to learn the lesson until it happened.   Countless articles, warnings, blogs, and reddit posts.  They were going to leave their money there until if was lost.
Third 
Security is hard.  Bitcoin will need better technology in order to be usable by the masses.  Then again the internet was hard in 1970 too.  You needed to be a programmer or engineer to figure it out.  Today you turn on your smartphone and you are there.  The good news is there is massive profits available to the companies which make Bitcoin easy, simple and secure.  Solutions will be found.  Solutions already exist they just need to be simplified.  
Fourth 
Bitcoin is cash.  You have no more or less protection than you would with cash.  If you paid Trezor $600 in cash you would be in the exact same boat.  You should treat it exactly like you would cash.  Regarding your third example if some no-name site asked you to put cash in an envelope and mail it to a PO box in Uganda and wait for your keychain you probably wouldn't.  Bitcoin is the same thing.
That being said dollars are cash too and payment services were built on top of dollars.  Trezor could have escrowed funds using a multi-key arrangement (consumer, trezor, arbitrator).  Why didn't trezor (or BFL)?  Why would they people were falling all over themselves to hand them irreversible money as soon as possible.  When consumers start demanding added value, merchants will be forced to give them that. Added value can come in the form of dispute resolution, escrow, or a reduced price (as the merchants costs have been reduced).
Bitcoin really is like the internet in the 1980s.  Clunky, hard to use, easy to make very bad mistakes, and many people can't see how it can displace "polished solutions".  If the rough edges are too rough them come back in ten years.  It will either be polished and "user proof" or gone but either way you will miss one hell of a ride.

Is a penny worth a lot?  What if a billion people give you a penny?
To put it into perspective last year there were ~80 billion credit card transactions and about another 20 billion other electronic fund transfers.  AFAIK nobody even tries to estimate how many cash transactions but lets be conservative and say the human race has 250 billion economic transactions per year.   1 billion annually would be a tiny 0.25% of global economic activity.
Now the first thing that should be going through your mind is the utterly staggering amount of wealth that the financial institutions take off the top.  Forget about the interchange % rate on cc.  Just $0.30 per tx on 80 billion transactions is $24 billion right there.

I don't blame you because the media treats quantum computing like a magical super power but D-Wave's quanum computer is a very specialized kind.  It is a quantum annealing processor.  It can't implement Shor's algorithm at all and is completely useless in the field of cryptography.  It has some interesting properties for solving certain problems (like route finding, network optimization, etc) but if you reference DWAVE talking about QC breaking cryptography it is a sign that you are uninformed.
As for a general purpose quantum computer.  In 2001 Shor's algorithm and a 4 qubit computer was used to factor the number 15.  In 2011 a 5 qubit computer was able to factor the number 21.
To break 256 bit ECDA would require tens of thousands of physical qubits (to provide error code correcting circuits).
Not sure how you jumped to the conclusion that Shor's algorithm would break SHA-256 (or RIPEMD-160).  It doesn't work against hashing algorithms.  Actually even if a quantum computer could break a 256 bit ECDSA public key right NOW if the public key is unknown that would provide a level of resistance so if you are worried about quantum computers be thankful Satoshi saw that attack vector and be sure to not reuse existing addresses.

+1 to this.  So many "professional" Bitcoin companies have been caught with their pants around their ankles by using a VPS.  If you don't have access to the bare metal you have no security.  This attack doesn't suddenly make hot wallets on VPS or cloud services insecure it just adds yet another attack vector to a laundry list of possible attack vectors.
In the linode hacks they use a much simpler method.  All VPS "servers" have a hidden super root account.  An employee logged in to the VPS using the super root account and stole the coins.  
For anyone running a hot wallet on a VPS it is only a matter of when not if all the coins will be stolen.

I already pointed it out.   The discount rate is only PART of the cost.
Lets look at a $5 digital good.
Discount rate is 35 but per charge is $0.30 so that is 0.6%.  So just the processing cost is already 3.6%.
Now lets assume 1% fraud rate.   So that brings their total cost up to 4.6%.   Not too bad ... except the chargeback fee of $35 (avg) per incident.   That is 700% of gross revenue and while it only happens on 1% of the sales that is 700% * 1% = 7%.
So for this hypotheticla merchant the cost isn't 3% it is 11.6%.

Not sure about the WU numbers but the VISA # are way off.
VISA had about 77 billion transactions last year that works out to ~212,000,000 tx per day not 206,000.  
I didn't check any other numbers, the VISA number just struck me as obviously wrong.  An error of that magnitude undermines the credibility of the site.

The security model of Bitcoin doesn't rely only on miners.  Miners create the consensus of transaction ordering, nothing else.
A block which is invalid is still invalid even if 51% or 99% of miners support it.   A chain of blocks built upon an invalid block is equally invalid.
In Bitcoin, every single node independently verifies all information received by other nodes,  it is a trustless system.

Just speculation but the way it is worded it sounds like it was intended to be a response to MtGox official statement.
Maybe MtGox was suppose to already have released the official statement, and when they didn't, the companies named decided to release their "response" anyways as a way to force it into the open.
I have no inside info just reading the statement it comes across like they expect the user to have already read MtGox's official statement (which doesn't exist).

SHA-256 (or any hashing algorithm or any symmetric encryption algorithm) isn't at risk from QC.  However all of those entities do use public key cryptography (ECC and RSA) as does HTTPS (SSL/TLS), and virtually every secure communication method known to man.  So it would be massive and disruptive however it wouldn't be due to any vulnerability with SHA-256.

@_date: 2014-03-03 00:12:39
Well it doesn't matter if you believe or not.  QC aren't particularly fast they reduce the time required to solve the problem, certain problems.  They can only do that for certain problems which fit certain algorithms.  The big one for attacking public key cryptography is Shor's algorithm.  Shor's algorithm allows a massive reduction in the time to find a solution.   O((log N)3) vs O(e1.9 (log N)1/3 (log log N)2/3) using classical computing.    
Still Shor's algorithm isn't magical and is  100% useless for deriving the digest from a hash.  People often like to attribute super human powers to QC as if any problem imaginable can just instantly be solved (the media is partially to blame).  They don't work that way.  If you still don't believe me, do some self research.  Either way in 20 years when SHA-256 is still not breakable by QC it will be self evident.
A quantum computing miner wouldn't have a slow hashrate it would have a zero hashrate.

Furthermore it is so incredibly idiotic it is inconceivable that anyone would design a system that way.  
MtGox scenario while naive at least has a plausibility to it.  They withdrew, mutated the tx, contact tech support manually, who investigated couldn't see a confirmed tx with that tx id and paid them again.
Who would even design a system that periodically looks to see if things it paid suddenly because unpaid so they could pay them again?

Yes it is very valuable if you enable port forwarding to accept inbound connections.  The Bitcoin security models requires that new nodes be able to connect to multiple independent peers.   The more independent peers out there (especially those which have enabled port forwarding) the harder it becomes to pull off sybil or isolation attacks.
While there currently are a large number of full nodes on the network, more is always better than less.  So yes it is the number one thing you can do to help ensure a secure decentralized network.

It isn't specifically just the number of zeros.  For any difficulty there is a specific target, a 256 bit number a hash needs to be below that number.
In hexadecimal the current target at the time of writing is:
If difficulty rose 1% the target would be 1% lower or ~
It may be hard to see looking at hexadecimal values which are 256 bit but the same concept applies with smaller numbers.
Lets say there was a hashing algorithm which output a number between 0 and 999,999,999.  At current difficulty lets say the target is 486,000.  Blocks are found 15% "too fast" so difficulty rises 15% that means the target declines by 15% so the new target would be 486,000 * 0.85 = 413,000.
If you are wondering what the target ends up with alll trailing zeros.  The difficulty that target is computed from has less than 256 bit precision so there is a rounding effect when computing the target.

50% of miners can't agree on which pool reward system is the most fair, which ASIC is the best deal, the min fee for inclusion in a block, how to handle non-standsrd txns, dealing with spam, or just about anything else.  
The idea that 99% agree on anything much less a contraversial change is just silly.   Simple answer if 99% collude then you are screwed.   They will probably also kill the value of bitcoin and thus their own returns (and the value of their existing coins) in the process.  So it would take not just 99% of miners but also 99% of miners to be both corrupt and stupid.

Coindesk and the "WinkDex" excluded MtGox from their respective weighted averages two weeks ago.  Nobody on local Bitcoins uses MtGox.  Coinbase dropped MtGox some time ago.  Just about anyone with any sense switched to BitStamp/BTC-e or some average of them for private trades long before this incident.  Bitcoinity uses BitStamp by default when you select BTC/USD.  Blockchain.info switched to BitStamp more than six months ago for showing dollar amounts of transactions.  BitPay dumped MtGox almost a year ago.

Port 8333 (tcp only)
By default the client will limit itself to 125 connections with peers.  You can raise or lower than by adding "maxconnections=n" to bitcoin.conf file.
You do not (and should not) open/forward 8332 unless you want remote procedure calls being made against your bitcoin wallet (and if you did you likely would not be asking on reddit). Port 8333 is all that is needed to connect to other nodes on the network.

Yes you can but other nodes will refuse to relay (and miners refuse to include) "low priority" tx without the min required fee.

You do realize that transactions are messaged signed by the private key they just happens to be specific messages that create new outputs ("move coins").

The 99% you responded to was pure hyperbole.  You can't get 50% of miners to agree on just about anything 99% simply won't happen.   If say 60% of miners switch to inflate a coin then difficulty confirmation times will be roughly doubled and will go back to normal in a month.   The switching miners will lose the block rewards gained on main chain and very likely the "new" coin will be worthless.  That very risk will always keep the portion of forkers relatively low.
Worst case scenario if enough miners jumped ship to break the difficulty adjustment the original coin could be forked to have a better adjustment algorithm and get "back on track" much quicker.  Bitcoin's current difficulty algorithm is rather simplistic.  That is actually a good thing (simple is always better if it accomplishes the task) but something more robust may be needed in the future.  True this would also require a hard fork but for non-miners the choice of fork difficulty or fork the minting rate (inflation) is a no brainer.

I think you misunderstand.  For other nodes to connect they may need an  available inbound connection.  Nodes which don't port forward or use more than 8 connections essentially just "use up" an available inbound port.  This isn't to say anyone should feel "bad" but he is right, they aren't helping the network.  
If someone wants to help, raise the # of connections to 32 or 64 and activate port forwarding on your firewall.  This will increase the pool of available inbound ports for other nodes and improve the decentralization of the network.

Yes and no.   Miners need very rapid propagation of blocks to other miners (at a minimum to 51% of the network hashrate).   Non-miners don't really need that fast of block propagation.  Yes 1GB/s would be not available for "the last mile" to residences but even for a residential miner they are likely connecting to a mining pool server in a datacenter which is going to have faster links.
Also IBLT has the potential to vastly reduce the amount of bandwidth necessary to propagate a block.  The current protocol is "nice and simple" but not optimized.  There is a lot of merit to keeping it simple from a security and maintainability standpoint but it does mean the protocol is more resource intensive than is necessary.
