Hold on - are you saying dropping to 6.5-7k will be a "massive sell?" Literally the price point from a month ago?
And then the FOMO will happen?
Too many people either think they're seasoned traders or talented evaluators in this space.

I don't think you're understanding my point. If the market moves down to 6.5-7k and then "rocket ships" up...it'll most probably just be another leg up. Normal (in Bitcoin terms, at least) market behavior.
There's nothing unique about what you're saying. It's normal market behavior.
Desperation would be if we dropped down below $1K or something.

Another "expert trader" exposed.

Bitcoin has never been hacked.

I have a few free-lance friends who are starting to say "I might offer 10% discounts if people pay me in Bitcoin"...and just generally, we're all obviously seeing this BTC request becoming more frequent. 
My thoughts have evolved into: "if you really want all your paychecks to be paid in Bitcoin, charge full price, get paid in USD (it's easier than asking your employer to figure out how to get it to you in BTC) and just immediately buy that full amount in Bitcoin!" 
Makes sense, no?

I think both of us just gave scenarios on why maybe BTC is just a tad too volatile for any employer/employee to sign a contract with a fixed rate.
@_date: 2019-09-13 02:13:48
Nah, not sure any employer would be happy about this...imagine a fixed BTC amount being worth 100% more only a few months later into a contract.
That's not going to currently work. It'd be the USD amount fixed into whatever amount of BTC.

Ah, touché.
Good points all around.
@_date: 2019-09-12 15:40:36
I think I was just more concerned with the sole individual who wants to be paid in BTC to accumulate more.

I knew it was fake right when I saw it...but my god did I get excited.
