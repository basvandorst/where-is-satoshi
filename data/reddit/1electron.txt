A lot of these early adopters with windfall gains ended up being scammed at the promise of bigger gains.
He probably has the address hash showing the account still contains coin but does not have his wallet and/or encryption passcode.
Or its a story to cover he lost it some other way.
Without the wallet file on the flash drive or computer you saved it from you're SOL.
A search from the original computer for wallet.dat file may be in order but that's likely something that's been tried many times over.

Increase the price and interest spikes causing overspending.. Then dump at the inflated price and leave the poor sods hodling bags.

Wonder what history there is to brag of.
Everywhere has history before the Roman's but what makes Rome noteworthy is their expansion and advancements to mankind.
Persia, off the top of my head (and mostly from TV) is responsible for..the number zero? And telescopes? Could be wrong part of the mideast I am crediting, I always thought the people to be too nomadic to contribute greatly to civilization.
Would be happy to receive an education to cites otherwise.

what you're describing is called a fork.. and it requires consensus.. which bascially means everyone agrees to change the software, and does.
or most need to agree.. there are always stragglers during a fork, maybe old nodes that arent tended to anymore, or someone that disagrees with the change in software and sticks to the old/original/unpopular code..
reprocussion of being on a forked blockchain is your transaction will only appear and be accepted cryptographically on your chain so only others that stuck to your code will be able to transact likewise.

educate yourself.
not through asking opinions.
the most secure way to store it would be to learn about it and weigh the opions that best suit your circumstances.
would you buy an ounce of gold without researching how to tell if its authentic, safe to posess and secure and is a consistant means to store some value in?
golds been around for ages so we naturally absorb some information about it, many people are getting herded into buying or "investing" into crypto opportunities simply as a setup to be scammed down the road.

early days i was interested in mining and started accumulating different cards to mess with bios voltage and frequencies..
a lot of the guys liquidating their cards had stories about how much coin the card made them and how it paid for itself a few times over, but increased diff made it seem less lucrative and anyhow, they got scammed out of most of their coin by online swindlers.

credit where its due the clean cut affirmative action well adjusted 20 something is NOT what is driving the mining industry these days.
there is an influx of millenial hipsters trying their hand but this is more of a journeyman kind of field.
of course profitability aside.. if you get cheap enough electricity and dont care how much hash you lose out on then its pretty easy to get by and sell your company next time theres a bull run.
