Your site does strike me as another scam website promising to do good but only wanting to rob innocent customers. First impression = scam

We use 37coins and they are amazing. They have an amazing team, they focus on this product and they have a growing global network. I strongly recommend using them for anyone looking to go SMS route.

Exactly!

I tried them a few months back and ran into some horrible customer support. ATLAS just announced locks and I would definitely use them over shitapult.

Obvious signs of a scam artist:  
1. Always complains about his or her hard work.  
2. Brand new business with both owners having zero experience in bitcoin. I searched your profiles online and you guys just jumped on the bandwagon. Your only interest is money, not helping people and we are not a dumb community.    
3. Begging for money by plastering donations links to paypal on every page. NIGGA R U SRS? You just launched a hack job wordpress site and you are asking for donations already for mistake riddled articles that are amateur as fuck.   
4. No history/experience on either reddit account.   
  
Go away hack job scam artists.

Nvidia was making a specific kind of video card for LTC mining at one point in early 2014.
