We will. We have been working with the cloud backend now, and is moving forward to create account management site and some small fixes here and there.
The frontend is a fork of ownCloud, with some performance tweaks that will be released as soon as they are reviewed for security reasons.
If you sign up for the newsletter you will get updates once in a while with information on the progress, and beta keys when the time is here.

Unsure on how you know of the existent or not.
Anyway, it's marketing. It gives us a estimate on how much interest it is in the product. Some beta testers have already started testing the service, sign up for the newsletter and maybe you get a beta key too soon in the future :)

Sorry it's not released yet. We need to make a code review of the whole system before we can release it since it can have bad consequences for the customers if someone finds a security flaw before us.
We ensure you both the owncloud core and the clients will be released as AGPL as ownCloud is at our github repositories. We have also found some slowness in the clients regarding upload of files, so we're planning to rewrite the sync protocol as well.
Sign up for the newsletter and get a chance to join the closed beta testing when we accept more outsiders (of the company) to test it :)

I'm sorry to hear that the link didn't work for you. Could you provide some more information if possible?, and maybe we can solve it!
We are based in Norway. And following the strict Norwegian privacy law :)
As backend (storage) we use OpenStack Swift. But we do not use the "external apps" plugin for communicating with Swift, we implemented a own faster model in C.

Nice, great it working now :) Good, then you know a little what you will be expecting. But we're forking it, and going our own way with the source and applications. It will be open source of course. :)
