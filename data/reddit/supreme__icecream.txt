Of course more people own it. But who's using it? Not many. Same with ETH, a lot of people may own it but no one uses it because no one uses smart contracts.

Why don't you be honest with yourself. Just because people own it doesn't mean they use it. The only reason this coin is alive today is because of people like G Maxwell that are trying to hold whatever is left of this coin. Don't get ahead of yourself lol.

why would i accept a volatile coin that is un-private? It was already proven that the NSA can track your payments and identify each user. 
Synth the head of SKYcoin was one of the first contributors at BTC. He pointed out that the first devs and contributors think btc is basically a social experiment at this point. This coin is basically riding on a name at this point. Gmaxwell is holding BTC by strings just trying to keep it together. transaction times are long, LN reaching mass adaption is hysterical, miners control the mining pools. this is one of the most centralized coins in the entire market. Skycoin is an asset backed decentralized crypto currency that actually has a real economy behind it. Who cares if btc's network is "strong"? its flawed and horrible. Look at ETH, 10 TPS, and each coin on their platform is on one blockchain. from a legal standpoint that will never work, companies need total control of their own blockchain token. 
BTC will rise, you will see more adoption in the world. but it will never work. BTC will eventually fall and be replaced by an actual coin that has real world need and use. 
watch this. maybe it might give you a different perspective on this topic.

How is that using it? Everyday I see a post on r/cryptocurrency on how only with coins that create real economys will survive or how asset backed coins will succeed. Everybody agrees, yet there is no economy with bitcoin. One day this is a gold value coin then it's a payment coin. Everybody can hold it but less than 100 or even 50k are actually using it. Why did growth stop at that number? Because bitcoin is terrible. None of the early contributors for btc actually believe this coin will have global adoption. Ever. Over the next few years btc will most likely pump hard and so will alts. But when btc goes down and it will. Coins with actual economys will replace it.

Less than 100k
