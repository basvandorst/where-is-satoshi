I doubt your mommy will let you buy more than 2. 
@_date: 2014-09-18 02:16:00
This has been discussed how many times by now?
@_date: 2014-09-18 00:57:43
Take a guess. Do you think this has been posted already, yes or no?

He is one of the biggest idiots on this sub. I seriously think he has some mental issues. 
@_date: 2014-09-18 01:49:09
Nobody cares. 
@_date: 2014-09-18 14:13:56
Hilarious. The biggest delusional cultist is finding out his 2 coins won't make him a millionaire. And now Bitcoin sucks haha. 
This alone is worth the price drop. 
@_date: 2014-09-20 16:51:02
Hilarious how i get downvoted. You are only allowed to say that banks are shitting their pants here. Anything else gets downvoted by the cultists. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:51:02
Sorry, but it's not. It's nothing. 
@_date: 2014-09-18 00:13:19
Yes we know. Because...guess what...someone else already posted this off topic news.
@_date: 2014-09-18 09:49:56
Yeah listen to this teen stoner BRO. He knows how it works. Wtf. Bro. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 17:22:56
Everyone here told their friends Bitcoin was an amazing buy at any level we've seen this year. So they might have a problem there. 
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:30:02
Blah blah blah
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:15:01
Idiot. 
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:47:58
No, you're not. 
@_date: 2014-09-18 10:22:58
I read the first part but then it was just too much nonsense. All these claims and nothing to back it up. 
And all these Rotschild conspiracies. Without any proof ofcourse. Complete bullshit article. 
But i bet the Bitcoin crowd will love it. 
@_date: 2014-09-18 14:02:50
The fact that this completely retarded question is posted 5 times a day here shows how desperate people are getting. The lower the price the more ridiculous the topics get. 
@_date: 2014-09-18 02:30:23
What is it with the made up titles lately?
Off topic news with Bitcoin added to it by the topic starter. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:48:38
Yes we get it. 6 months of a real nasty bear market and everybody and his brother getting out is actually good news. 
Is there anything ever bad news here?
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:19:47
It's such a tiny amount of money for the feds and that alone makes this claim completely retarded. 
@_date: 2014-09-20 16:11:03
Sorry but they don't look scared at all. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:54:52
Damn, why didn't i know about this? I'm gonna get rich!
@_date: 2014-09-18 22:05:51
30 people before you posted they got their invite. We get it. They're sending out invites. Now please stop. 
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:34:47
Stupid kids here. I wish they would get their own sub. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 17:21:16
I'm willing to bet you won't spend more than 100 bucks and most likely nothing. Just like all the other people here posting how much they are buying.
