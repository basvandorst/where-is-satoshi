Lol. If I was invested in bitcoin I would have a reason to agree with your 'analysis' because it would be beneficial for me. I, however, invest in things that have a certain expected ROI per year because my investments actually *do something* instead of sitting around praying for a speculation-boost to value.
I noticed you didn't explain why your linear regression model is better than a quadratic or exponential regression model, you didn't explain why 1200 days is any better than 365 days or 24 hours in terms of predicative ability, and you seem to not even understand what an incredibly loose fit (read: incredibly large sum of squared residuals) between data and the model predicted data implies about the 'predictive ability' of one's model.


You see that part where the value of bitcoin ascends preposterously fast outside the bounds of your own model? Yeah, that means you have a preposterously large sum of squared residuals for this model, meaning it has near-zero predictive ability.
The fact that you didn't even include this essential figure demonstrates pretty fully that you either are a) completely oblivious or b) deviously trying to artificially inflate perceived value by telling people "my flawless model means the value will definitely keep going up!" In my opinion you're probably a mix of both.
Also, **LOL** that you think including 1200 days somehow means it is more accurate in the short, medium, or long term outlook. Also, **LOL** that you didn't even respond to the point I made with a graph and 6 full years of a predictive linear regression model implying 1929 was gonna be a fantastic year for stockholders.
If you want to get a model that has a tight fit and is still hopelessly unpredictive, you may want to use [LaGrangian Interpolation]( or [Newtonian Interpolation]( At least that way you'll be able to convince others ignorant of basic statistics that your model is accurate (though still wildly unsound for predictive ability).
In short, I don't really give a shit either way because I'm in no way affected by this latest collapse (though I am enjoying the schadenfreude to be honest). If anyone wants to believe this model of yours, they fully deserve the speculative ramifications down the line. Have a good day friend!
I saw you asked about the SoSR. The basic gist is this: you made a model that is trying to fit data. Currently your model has a line sloping upwards somewhat, thus implying that the value will intrinsically continue to go up in the future based in past performance.
The problem is **where the data your model predicts and real world results don't match.** Take any data point from your model in the last month. Draw a straight line down from that actual data point to your model's line. That is known as the **residual**. A large residual means that your model predicted one thing, but real world results predicted something entirely different.
[Edit 2 - See this basic example.]( The green line represents the residual.
To get a sense of what your entire model's residuals look like, you use a method called the Sum of Squared Residuals (which is exactly what it sounds like -- you determine the residual for every datapoint, square it to both remove any negation and emphasize error the worse the residual, then sum them all up). This in the most basic sense is a figure that helps you determine exactly how much error there is between your model and the real world. Ideally, this number should be close to zero. Your model has some preposterously large SoSR, which means that it is extremely error prone.
This is because of the inherent volatility of the bitcoin market. **You can't accurately predict the future because it is so damned volatile.** Even if you used one of the two interpolation methods I linked above, which would net you a very low SoSR (zero actually because it will perfectly match your data), it would be worthless for using it to determine future price movement because it will only be accurate for the data it was modelled over.

Is this entire sub insane or does OP not grasp this basic financial fact: **past performance is in no way indicative of future results.**
Try using linear regression to plan your buy/sell in any market in the world and you'll be bankrupt within a month. I mean seriously, **regression** and not just that, **linear regression**? Why is linear regression any more accurate than exponential regression? Why did you select your timeline as the last year instead of the last 24 hours?
You just pulled numbers out of your ass to make it seem like bitcoins are going to go up in the hopes of convincing other people to speculate and buy bitcoins, thus driving demand up and thus making your own bitcoins worth more. All based off an easily spotted fabricated analysis. I don't know if you are scheming to drive the price up or just actually this financially oblivious, but either way you're blatantly misrepresenting and just *lying* about this 'analysis' of yours having any meaning or practical implications.
This subreddit is beyond insane if anyone actually buys this.
OP is *so right*. I mean just look at [graph of the stock market from 1922-1928]( By this clearly infallible and certainly accurate linear regression model with my arbitrarily chosen timeline to include, 1929 is looking to be the best year on record guys!
I didn't even bother to look at your graph before but now that I have, **LOL.** I wonder why you didn't include the [sum of squared residuals]( in your 'analysis' (I have a feeling I know why haha).

So let me get this straight.


* Model is designed to predict long term future trends
* Model has consistently and laughably failed to predict long term future trends
* ???
* Profit!
Flawless logic. I can see you are well on your away to your first billion. Don't let me dissuade you, you should leverage all your assets immediately to 'invest'. After all, it couldn't possible go wrong.

Read my edit, you may have responded while I was writing it.

You didn't understand what I wrote at all.
I guess the short way to explain this would be this: **your model failed hopelessly at predicting data in the past (I.e. Large error I.e large sum of squared residuals). Therefore trying to use it to predict data in the future is also somehow even more hopeless.**
You can't even make your model fit data you already have -- how the hell can you claim it will fit data in the future, data *you don't have*?
