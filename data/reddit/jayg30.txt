BCH is going to end up trading for &lt;4k and then drop off heavily. Bunch of BTC owners just looking to offload BCH for quick gains I think.

Stupid question but, if you use coinbase to purchase bitcoin with a bank transfer, are you able to sell it immediately even though the bank transfer takes 3-5+ business days? I know it locks in the purchase at current market price, but I assume you can't sell those bitcoins until the bank transfer fully completes. Is that correct? Thx
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:43:05
So yes, you can sell even though your bank transfer is still pending? I just want to understand how it works. Clearly know if you can or can't pull out in case of an emergency would be a smart thing to understand don't you think? I've read some people have had pending bank transfers for weeks due to complications with banks.

same, bank still didn't transfer my money and I'm stuck. :(
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:18:46
Send me the hard drive. I'll even sent you back 1 of the BTC when I recover it. :)
Seriously though, I've done some forensic HDD recovery before.

Yea? Why do you think that? I mean ppl probably thought it was going to drop this week. But it went from ~14k to 19k and still climbing. What data do you see that makes you think it's about to drop? I'd love to see a short period of drop so I can buy in like I should have last week, but so far I see no indication that is happening.

lol I don't think that is a timezone. It's MST or CST. CMT is Country Music Television.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:55:32
What do you think is more likely for next week; that it drops below 18k or reaches close to 25k? :)

For those that still don't know what is going on with GDAX and BCH - 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:09:58
anyone that didn't buy missed it at 16.8k. It will now begin the upwards trend again to a new ATH. IMO
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:26:37
Well GDAX shows it in the trade history. happened at 20:22:49 - 20:22:53. And I really don't think GDAX/Coinbase meant for the trades to happen.

thanks, makes sense. If you are holding coins for months/years probably best to incur the fee and transfer to cold storage. Curious what you mean about the experienced day-trader, do they have some approach to avoid potentially losing their coins?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:26:41
doesn't look like BTC or BCH is doing particularly well now...
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:52:39
thanks. That's what I figured.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:12:02
yes I'm aware, thanks. Was just curious if you got access to the coins quicker if purchasing directly on coinbase with a bank transfer. Sounds like that is a no, which means the only advantage is allowing you to lock in a price for a fee. Wire transfer the only option if trying to move quickly.

Been reading about bitcoin taxes (capital gains, short and long). Here is what I don't understand. Say you bought bitcoin over a year ago. You then also buy a bit more 3 months ago. You now sell a fraction of it. How do you know if that is short or long term capital gains? I mean, it's not like you get to "pick" which bitcoins you are selling. It sort of matters since if you don't hold for over a year you are supposed to be taxes as normal income which is most likely a higher rate.

Sure would be nice if there was clarity on the tax ramifications to converting to alts.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:39:27
no thanks. Wanting to understand how things work isn't a crime. I haven't done anything on an exchange, just have coins in a wallet since 2015. Wanting to know if I'd be stuck waiting for a transfer to clear if something drastic was to happen doesn't mean anything but wanting to understand the system.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:12:10
does anyone think that btc will drop again once bch trading starts happening on GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:16:04
ah gotcha. So just trade the amt of BTC you have held for &gt;1yr and you most likely are fine. That would make sense. IRS is such crap.

they decided to screw everyone and help their buddies. Insiders. Someone gonna come knocking on Coinbase door. :)
