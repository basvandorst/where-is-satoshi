I wear a reddit shirt all the time and get random props for it. I'd wear this with a open zippered hoodie. Sure.

My dream car is an Audi R8 and it is much cheaper than either car.

That is what eggify.com is trying to promote by making it easy for anyone to buy and sell items for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-28 21:25:33
Good point. That info is now gone.
@_date: 2014-09-22 00:47:22
Eggify is "Bitcoin classifieds for the good guys" . "Any posts that are sketchy will be removed immediately."

I had some bitcoin but my password was on a computer that got stolen :(
@_date: 2014-09-16 01:38:22
I'm so jealous of the plate AND car!
@_date: 2014-08-30 02:11:11
I hope that happens!

No these are real. This particular dealership sells cars for bitcoin. 
(There are mainstream stories about this but I figured I'd give a bitcoin site the link love)

1 month. It's Manhattan.

I don't even know. I just remember buying some because I was curious. I remember it that I had to remember some key and it was super long and there was no way to recover it.

You need to call +1 (415) 433-7970 to make a reservation if you are using bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 02:56:36
Haha yes. Didn't he have 5 kids in 2 years? I think he is an alien.
@_date: 2014-09-15 02:34:55
You're right. Live in San Francisco!
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:10:44
Maybe the real guy set this guy up to throw the media off his trail?
@_date: 2014-02-08 18:29:06
This is awesome! I just promoted it on Facebook.
@_date: 2014-08-30 05:03:42
I was looking into bitcoin years ago. I really wish I had bought more. The ones I had I lost... I would have bought this ASAP.

Just posting something that was interesting to me. The man is a wealth of bitcoin knowledge. I had to stay really late to talk to him because he was swarmed by people. lol
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:27:00
It is interesting that there is a session about using the Block Chain at the Samsung Developer Conference.
@_date: 2014-08-07 21:44:18
You have to call about this particular one. They have another that the price is listed though. It is 584 BTC
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:28:41
If people are going to get rid of it why not buy something with it instead. Then you can tell the press about it and get bitcoin some positive mentions.
@_date: 2015-01-16 19:00:29
What are you in the bitcoin subreddit then bespokeyachtcharter? Plus I know plenty of yacht owners and owning one does not mean you are smart.
@_date: 2015-01-16 21:18:14

@_date: 2015-01-16 21:40:51
Ain'ters gonna ain't
@_date: 2015-01-16 21:34:13
Just trying to spread a little positivity amongst the bad press :)
