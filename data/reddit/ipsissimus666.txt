I was just trying to qualify the suggestion.. I didn't say it was a very good one. 
On a small and swift enough scale, I'd say some polls wouldn't hurt anyone just to try and get a feel for everyone's positions.. I'm sure we could implement some anti spamming measures, like account must be &gt; 1 year old or something..

@_date: 2016-01-18 20:14:18
I think we are over complicating this..
If you have a business model making good money, and something comes along that makes your business model obsolete (to varying degrees), this grows a lot of incompatibility and divisive competition.  
I'm sure Blockbuster Video didn't help develop Netflix so that it could hasten its own demise... Sure, Blockbuster may be able to adapt to an extent, but the business models are near wholly opposed.
I really think bitcoin is as much a political development as much as it is a technological one. It's not a conspiracy, but a conflict of interest.. Industries always face the wrath of innovation, and finance will likely be no different.
Are these big banks and payment processors really going to be okay with losing millions/billions in transaction fees each year? Because it seems pretty clear that is where we are headed.. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 20:20:47
I use it as monetary self defense and preservation..
Without the ability to simply print more money, these wars likely would not have escalated to the degree they deed..  If they could have financed at all.

It's been well established what lengths government and private interests are capable of to maintain their monopolies..

Even still, it's fine to be frustrated... Just keep your head about you.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:45:26
If I had the right mechanisms to secure it, hell yeah.. But as your examples proves, physical security has it's own inherent obstacles.. That's where digital security has the chance excel.
I don't think bitcoin is ready for mainstream adoption.. You are absolutely right about that. But as development continues in this new and increasingly digital world, we will invent better consumer options.
Paper contracts and money have utility, most certainly.. But for how much longer? I think stronger encryption is the direction in which we are headed, and this is just a start..
Also, 


Absolutely.. It's an utterly terrifying concern.. But by taking the risk, and removing the wealth we create by working from the existing monetary system, it allows us to non violently resist and circumvent this system that brings so many people harm. For some, it's not a reasonable risk. But for others it is.. I feel like that's freedom.
@_date: 2016-01-10 15:46:39
Are there any real world examples of banning internet protocols yet? Would bitcoin be the first to your knowledge? (I'm googlin' it right now...)

@_date: 2016-01-21 20:41:03
I've been curious about this too... What are the chances of some kind of artificial suppression going on?
For instance, a bank, government, or other private entity buying some amount of BTC almost everyday in attempt to "hold" the fiat price at a given rate? Would that be plausible to orchestrate?
@_date: 2016-01-04 23:19:14
hmm.... i like the mega man sounding part.
@_date: 2016-01-06 06:01:57
Double edged blade certainly.. I just hope we can get more people thinking harder/looking closer at this stuff.
I don't recall even hearing this notion of banning cash until bitcoin showed up... If Denmark really is looking at this, do they have some kinda super secret encryption in development? How do they figure they are going to secure these networks...
I'd be curious to see percentage of cash transactions vs card transactions..

If banks and credits cards are poised to lose billions per year in transactions fees due to their potential obsolescence, I would imagine they are going to fight that change.
And I am talking about this Mike Hearn/R3 situation.. But it wasn't just an obscure post on medium... Well known and respected nationwide publications picked this story up. 
And because these interest carry a type of informational authority based on their name recognition alone, I feel it would be naive to think social engineering or propagandizing isn't on the table.
Companies have been exposed conducting "psy-op" campaigns to manipulate public perception before.. I'm not saying that is what going on here, but I think it would be a mistake to say that it definitively isn't.
It's not conspiracy, it's just business. People protect their interest within their means, and these people in particular have considerable means. Like I said, if the truth is technically indeterminable, I think it's best to cover all likelihoods..

If bitcoin goes, so do most other encrypted systems.. Bitcoin kinda would be considered a small fry at that point, because it would be open season on everything else...

Because hackers will terrorize them, just as hackers tend to do to closed systems often... It's my understanding that the Bitcoin blockchain will basically be a lost cause for malicious actors to attack... Private blockchains will be more subject to intrusion/fraud, due to political or economic motivations of hacktivist seeking to embarrass and "get even" with the entities using them.. Does a criminal mug the massive intimidating guy, or the old, frail lady?
It'd be like storing your goods in an expensive cardboard box, right next to massively secure safe, that the public says you can use for free.
It'd be like paying to walk around... You could accomplish a similar outcome not paying. Walking around is free... I think the reason they don't is because it's as if they are signing their own death certificate.

Thanks for the response. I haven't checked into it myself, but aren't Satoshi-associated wallet balances estimated at somewhere near 1,000,000 BTC, or 4-5% of the ultimate supply? (I have no idea if that is actually true, or how that may have been determined.. just repeating here)

Don't get me wrong. I understand the value Bitcoin brings to the table, but if a company happens to be one that legislates and manipulates veiled institutional currency laws designed to work in their favor and not ours, how are they supposed subscribe to these changes? 
Granted they could evolve like rest of us.. but for these types of predatory financial institutions, isn't Bitcoin adoption a figurative bullet to the head? I suppose the alternate would be a slow and terrible demise, trying to duct tape your business model as it's invalidated by crypto? Is this like a mass execution of these companies? 
Or even Microsoft... I'm sure they have armies of underwriters and financial experts determining risk probability of accepting Bitcoin, and just how exactly did those meetings go leading up to acceptance?
(in no particular order)
*"Absolutely not.."
"Maybe we can do less than 3% of total sales max.
"Oh god, please don't.."
"Well, we don't know that would be legal or not.."
"What the fuck is a Satoshi?"
"Wait, how much would the transaction fee cost?"
"Are you guys fucking crazy?"*
Hopefully culminating in -  *"Oh this is a no brainer.."*
I'm not concerned. I like my position here very much. I'm just so curious to see how these big players react. I'm fine Satoshi being unknowable. I guess I just never imagined such huge leaps being made so quick.. Especially when then are so many misnomers and misunderstandings promulgated both internally inadvertently, and externally maliciously and purposefully. Is someone like, say... the CEO of Best Buy going about his day under the impression that Bitcoin is anonymous gold coins ISIS found in the desert under the auspices of one Satoshi Nakamoto... That guy who took that picture for Apple's new iphone advertisement, and who got his free lunch? 
Thanks for the links friend.

You friend, are on point. These responses are along the lines of what I was expecting to read.. I feel very much on the same page with you as far research and understanding. Thanks for your prompt response.
But regarding Peter Todd, he absolutely says miners are third parties, word for word... I felt like I was going crazy.. Yesterday I had Andreas A. and James D'Angelo getting me hyped, and then today Peter Todd was like nah... Bitcoin's future is a coin toss... I was crushed..
Maybe we could say, "The miners are the neutral medium upon which the trust-less transacting is coordinated and executed"?

@_date: 2015-10-30 04:46:45
I would like to chime in and say I agree with you.. Part of this situation is due to lack of financial discipline and education.. It's funny how "first world" does not equal competency, or economic literacy if you will. Most people suck with money..
And I think that is just the point. We should aim for systems that FACTOR IN incompetency and scheming; lying; gaming...
It seems funny how society creates this laws or standards, and they are totally out of touch with how people ACTUALLY behave in the real world.. It makes it seem silly that we pretend that kids won't cheat in school, or lie... Or that teenagers won't be curious about sex..
Maybe there really is a huge lack of personal empowerment/responsibility going around, to where not being able to take care of your financial well-being is a new average in some societies.. Maybe we could chalk it up to, "some people are just bad with money."
What I'm curious about though... Should we create our laws and social structures to serve the lowest common denominator or society? "Catering" in sense, to the lowest of us? Because it seems like we are beating our heads against the wall trying to get impossible transformations from people..
An analogy I've taken to recently... Imagine society is a pot of soup. This soup has been heavily seasoned with corruption, guns, bigotry, and ineptitude. Our culture is utterly shocked when they taste (experience) this soup we've made, like we can't fathom why it tastes like the ingredients we've added.
And worse, our reaction is to think we can maybe somehow subtract these seasonings after they've been stirred in.. Our governance and leadership equate to, "We can't believe this potato carrot soup tastes like potato carrot soup... Just pretend it taste different."
So with Bitcoin the compliancy is *built it..* Right? It's like a Judo (using a foes own energy against them).. Andreas said something like "aligning greed with honesty." This seems like the best model, if we can implement in other systems somehow..
In my line of work, my aim is to eliminate the opportunity for user error everywhere I can. As more systems are built to account "the lowest common denominator", i.e. the uneducated and corrupt, will this arrangement benefit us as a whole? Or could enable further loss of critical and ethical thinking, creating more an even more gullible and inept society?
@_date: 2015-03-09 04:12:57
So we are basically running with an unknowable variable of,  "to what degree and efficiency could miners abuse that trust?"
We know what would happen, it's just a question of logistically could they pull it off?
I've seen the incentive structure characterized as "It costs more to lose than it does to win. Gaming the network is more costly than participating honestly" But this seemingly doesn't account for a Joker-like actor who doesn't necessarily care about winning/losing, but instead potentially just wants to watch the (bitcoin) world burn? (and he/they just collect on whatever is left?)
@_date: 2015-10-05 19:47:29
I think technology always empowers people.. Just not equally in most cases.
And I sure as hell don't think the poor should get into speculative investing, scheming to get rich quick like our subreddit here, (1 BTC = 1 BTC)...
I just want people to have the tools to beat oppression.. People don't choose where they were born (class/geography), but I think technology can make things a little more equitable.

Prior to Peter wrapping things up, a team went on with a segment titled "the human element of trust",  expressing this thought that trust needs to be recognized as being role specific and contextual. Like other "people-based" issues, we should remember that it's relative to the observer or the actor. Maybe I just missed something, and together they were trying to coordinate a larger premise.. But I don't think so..
The language used from Andreas to Peter just mixed me up big time. I know they are specialists in different vocations, but they literally said the exact opposite things. I posted in bitcointalk.org to reach out..
Thanks again friend. I appreciate it.

So this is just the incentive structure working as intended? Essentially looking out for the network through majority consensus?
Peter, would you say this theoretical forking super-majority would be taking a large risk by attempting to implement this new 50BTC block reward chain? Once the network identified the errant chain, wouldn't those propagating miners be kind of "blacklisted" due to their negatively effected reputations? (not to say they couldn't just start again under a new name)
@_date: 2015-10-05 20:22:22
Right on.. Winners and losers...
Is there a middle ground that has ever existed? I guess not huh...
What I'm getting at is... Wealth is not money right? Money is just the metric... I have enough (unit of account) to purchase food... I'll earn (x unit of account) for my work...
Wealth/value is created by human beings though their time, work, or developments. Money (unit of account) isn't the value. It's a commonly denominated IOU of value.
A neuroscientist should be rewarded (x unit of account) more than a janitor. I get this... But our unfettered system of commerce has run off the rails... A CEO of (whatever titan company) accumulates more (unit of account) than is commensurate with his value/wealth he contributes to society...
So if this system is so unequal/unfair (where you are fucked by CEO just by being born on the wrong continent)... What is the alternative?
And we have arrived at techno-socialism haven't we... This shit is so confusing.. Without capitalism, we no doubt wouldn't have been as incentivized to accomplish all of the awesome shit humanity has pulled off so far... But is there a limit to this system? Can we just undulate back down from this money grab mayhem towards ????, and then start the process over again? Something has got to give out right? Debt money is not forever money..

@_date: 2015-10-24 16:34:14
One of the most pertinent questions I would love to see researched is, "Is our generation bringing this on themselves because they are lazy?"
Because I really don't think so necessarily. I'm thinking my un or underemployed peers do indeed want to enter the work force, but we are missing the drive and technology to help monetize their capacity to create wealth, goods, and services.
Addressing mass unemployment in our now hyper connected, and increasingly unequal and automated societies is a novel problem. In pursuit of greatness, humanity harnesses existing energy and material resources to build great things. So if our unemployed can be thought of as "energy", we can potentially apply this power to society's under-developed needs and goals..
Hell, people already "day labor".. Imagine a decentralized (thus localized) capacity to organize labor where needed, with low administrative costs. I believe these people want to work, and even "prosper" in a humble sense, but *they don't know how to* under our existing, and newly developed conditions. There are plenty of exceptions and extremes, but I take issue with this narrative of, "Well, technology is here, so I'm done working/learning." Saying people don't want to work is a step away from saying people like being poor. It seems absolutely daft.
It's like a room full of toddlers and toys, and no one is playing.
Or it's like a room full tools, and no one is tinkering.
Decentralized methods of organizing society is what this tech really offers. Imagine you could digitally attend college courses through video conference, on a pay per use basis.. I'll pay the spare $20 I have this week to catch a part of this workshop on refrigeration repair. Not replacing vocational schools, but adding options for those interested to be involved.. Think of the trend towards HBO Go, or pay per use media. I know sports fans would love to buy access to just ESPN, and not the rest of the shitty cable service they don't use. Our system creates overages and waste at every turn, all in the pursuit of wealth, or retaining it's stranglehold on an industry. I'd rather throw this food away then share it with you, because it's more cost effective.
I think the program is called Task Rabbit, but in the same style as Uber or as Open Bazaar, it simply matches a buyer and seller. Or in this case, an employer and a worker.
If the economy can be restructured to allow for more frictionless transacting, I think we might put more people to work, and might empower more people to pursue greatness. Their means to do these things will be enhanced.
It's like we are starving to death in a room full of food.

This is my reply from another post today asking "What has money bought that made you happy?" I feel like we are on the same page.
Bitcoin... It makes me very happy to know I'm part of community that through it's design, largely circumvents the war and finance economy...
The hoarders of society’s wealth abuse their power to play fast and loose with our future, and we can't seem to get it regulated? So be it.. We’ll fix it without your permission then. The DIY'ers, activist, and innovative minds of our generations will begin to solve problems, and in time we'll have a new monetary system by the people, for the people, that aims to work the same for Citi and Goldman the way it works for a poor family in an undeveloped country.. Everybody gets the same rulebook.
Billions of people worldwide are excluded from our current system.. There has been limited access to financial services because our current system's infrastructure doesn't support it, or doesn’t exist where it needs to. Now these people will have access to loans, titles, ID, and property, because we can implement these contracts and arrangements on a phone... over a network… efficiently and frictionless… peer to peer. You could donate a 25 cents to development projects worldwide within seconds. Our existing system of intermediaries doesn’t permit this type of transacting because it can’t, won’t, or both. Money doesn't need to be as complicated as we've made it.
So I guess I'm happy that money "bought" me a closer look at what “it” actually is. Everyone needs to have access to some reliable form of money… It’s just a ledger! .. But humanity has always been plagued by the issues attached to this pursuit, because the powerful almost always have the means to change the rules, and alter the ledger in their favor. People are buying stuff they shouldn’t be able to buy.. Elections and laws namely..
Even if we were allowed to "look under the hood" of our system, it's so specialized, we wouldn't know where to begin.. There is no financial system for common people. How the hell do you get a “bank account”, when you can’t read or have no address? Fuck nations, we stand for the people of this single Earth.. We need a system that is MORE inclusive, that works for MORE people on this planet.
Centralized money, in a way, "bought" people's liberty, by constraining the means to transact with other. It may be more accurately described as having been plundered, but without a doubt, the vast majority "buys" this grand illusion that liberty, happiness, and safety are somehow the just features of “owning” money. The pursuit of wealth has become a religion… In God We Trust, and the faithful believe it. When in truth, we ourselves are the creators of these conditions and virtues..
We misunderstand what value really is, because in the same way people flock to the churches every Sunday to share the myth; their illusion… We are being actively deceived by the people we’ve “trusted” to “show us the way.” Our family is everyone’s family, and a quick look around the world will show us just how damaging this type of “faith” has been. We elect to try to "hope" our way out of the worst of us as a species... The self serving, corruptible, and opportunistic. Us.. We try to legislate away problems (guns, drugs, theft...), ignoring how people actually behave in the real world, outside of this myth...
Now we have a system that FACTORS IN humans being humans.. This system of governance works, regardless of whether people play by the rules or not. The compliancy is built in, and this is direction I believe we should be headed.. Education and empowerment can de-incentivize the behavior we know is counter to our progress. We've just never had the tools to try.
Regardless of race, nationality, or class, we are all one people.. And it's about time we start embracing our common interest and goals freely, and stop asking for permission to be what we are. With every block published, we further develop the means to realize this.
Best money I've ever spent.

in response to what jstolfi had to say regarding confirmation time and transactions costs..
i do understand the thought behind the miners being "consolidated", and therefore potentially discriminating against certain transactions. i really don't quite understand where that could lead to. i'm assuming developments to the bitcoin code or mining incentive structures could be employed to quell that scenario. but i feel like that's out of my comprehension level. i also understand that transaction confirmation isn't "instant".
as far as the costs per transaction... if we were to try do determine an aggregate cost per transaction, attempting to factor in the cost of electricity, physical space for the mining rigs, overhead costs, etc., i imagine the cost per up to this point may be well above a few pennies. and i'm sure that initially the cost per transaction must be getting less expensive as infrastructure is built into place... but it doesn't seem plausible that we would run a network where this changetip for 1000 bits i just received from ImNotRocketSurgeon would collectively cost the network $10.. that does not sound like it would work at all. and obviously it IS currently working..
well, i'm just not using the resources at hand.
my apologies.. so it's clear i don't understand this element of the technology. i'm okay being a little ignorant here, because hopefully that means i'm learning.. thanks for pointing that out.
