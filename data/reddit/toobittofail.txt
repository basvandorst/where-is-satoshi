"Bitcoins will have to reach certain threshold of liquidity, indicated by a solid exchange in every financial center and a real money supply – i.e. market cap – of at least $50 billion, before they can be used as an instrument in a speculative attack. This will either coincide with or cause a currency crisis. "

Still possible to claim any of them when holding old bitcoins? I guess noone likes touching his cold storage for every new alt, but i would support projects which coins get added to my bitcoins and most likely hodl them too instead of dumping.

But we wouldn't make millions selling ICO or pre-mined coins then!  
Even better of course would be if we could try out new altcoin concepts as drivechains. If there wasn't so much political bullshit we could already have them and have rootstock and different scaling solutions using only the bitcoin currency.

I never understood why there are not more altcoins created using the bitcoin user balances.   
If you give old bitcoin hodlers free skin in the game on new alts, i am sure there would be less fighting and instead we could all just focus on the best tech without constant fighting because in reality we do care about our investment.
And most people feel insecure about their investment and the bitcoin vs altcoin debate sometimes.   
Imagine someone would have created an ethereum clone early enough with bitcoin balances, ethereum would have lower marketshare now.
And if ethereum devs had enough skin in the game with bitcoin already, maybe they wouldn't even have needed their scam ICO in the first place.
On top of that, they would have had a sound monetary policy to start with, when it seems like they have no idea about theirs on current ethereum.

No, i was saying if you only got 20k in bitcoin, i would not expect to get rich from it over a timespan that justifies checking the bitcoin price every 5 minutes. Not saying that 20k in bitcoin is nothing, but just keep calm and hodl then.

I maybe spent a year of my life reading about bitcoin, but if you got all eggs in one basket, better watch that basket!  
It only makes no sense if you only got like 20k in bitcoin, then who cares, just try to make more money somehow else with that time.

The question should be could bitcoin realistically take a government down?
