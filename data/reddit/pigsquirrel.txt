Also work in IT Security here, and completely agree with you. In an office environment, it is 100% the job of the infrastructure guys to make sure everything is playing nicely, and the security guys' job to make sure nobody shits it up. And yes, manufacturers could do a better job of explaining or restricting the channels and options, but you can only expect so much, and there's really nobody else in a position to do anything about it.
This thread seems to be more about home or apartment situations, though. Currently living in an apartment building, and it's a free-for-all on 2.4 GHz. Even in places that have rules against bringing your own gear, enforcing stuff like this against residents is far more difficult than enforcing it for employees. I just stick to wired and 5GHz.

Nope, the bandwidth covers 5 channels 1 overlaps with 0 and -1 (you can't use 0 and -1 for the center frequency, since it would extend outside of the band), 2, and 3. 6 overlaps with 4, 5, 7, and 8. 11 overlaps with 9, 10, 12, and 13. There are higher channels in other regions that may be usable, but that's beyond what I'm familiar with.
It's actually quite interesting. There are other 2.4GHz devices, such as XBee radios, that use the same channels, but with less overlap. If I recall, XBees only overlap with the adjacent channels. Then there's the other common 2.4GHz device: the microwave oven. Microwaves carve like a 10 channel ~~slice~~ slab right out of the center, which is why a leaky (in RF terms) microwave will also nuke the local wifi.
Decent pictures in this wikipedia article

Taking this opportunity to clear up some misconceptions. There are 11 channels, of which only 3 should ever be used: 1, 6, and 11. These three channels don't overlap. You can have 100 devices all on the same channel and they will all peacefully cooperate and take turns. But as soon as some smartass decides to use an "unused" channel, for example 9, it will shit up channels 6 and 11 (and 6 and 11 shit up 9), all of the collision avoidance fails, and everything grinds to a crawl. So stuck to the main 3 channels: 1, 6, and 11.
EDIT: As redditHi points out below, this is for the US. Look up your country's preferred channels, or just stick with the router's defaults. It should be manufactured and configured specifically for the region in which it is sold due to the many regional laws regarding RF. Many (possibly most) routers choose based on the least busy either at boot or periodically, and almost no router will ever place itself onto a no-no frequency without manual intervention. A lot of engineers got paid a lot of money to figure out how to do this well, but it never hurts to check up on it and maybe learn a thing or two in the process as well.

I'm sorry, your honor, but it's actually just an entire hard drive volume filled with random data gathered from a radio telescope, and not a cryptosystem.

Hey FBI, by account name was SR_Throwaway11, you owe me 400BTC. I didn't buy anything illegal, promise. It's not like you seized all of SR's servers and logs or anything.

Actually, doing a double-spend is pretty damn easy with 0 confirmations. Just hand-craft two transactions (Which is easy) spending all the coins from the same addresses. Send one, then, while waiting on the first confirmation, send the next with a higher TX fee. With any luck, the second one will get in the next block, and the first can't, so the (chronologically) first transaction looks like a double spend and gets thrown out while the second looks perfectly legit.
Then the bouncer beats the shit out of you and throws you out on the street, beer-less and bruised.

You have to use a modified client to "resend" a transaction. It's basically a double-spend. The transaction with the higher fee gets picked up first, and the first transaction (with lower fees) gets blocked because it is a double-spend.

Dvorak represent!
I'm on my third year post-switch. It's been wonderful.
Though I can't use QWERTY worth crap anymore. Probably because I sucked at it before despite somehow hammering out 50-60WPM typing with about as much grace as a beached whale.

I don't think you understand how important mining is. 
Miners don't only "find" new bitcoins and inject them into the system. Mining is also the *one and only* way to record transactions.
No mining, no transactions, no bitcoin.

And instead be exposed to Coinbase volatility.
BitPay seems like the best way to use Bitcoin as a transaction system in a USD-based business.

How usable will this be by people in the Land of Freedom? Any paperwork done to make sure we don't get stiffed (and you shut down) by any three letter agencies? Or that you will just have to shut your doors to us because Uncle Sam says so?

It doesn't need to be trademarked. It's no different than if somebody tried to trademark "SCISSORS" in the scope of "Handheld cutting devices" and sue the pants off of anybody making and selling scissors.
They'd get laughed out of town.

When, not if, shit hits the fan and the Big Banks start going right after Bitcoin the way they know best by purchasing some legislation, it will most likely be the EFF up to bat on our side.

It's no different then. Controlling 2 pools at 26% each is still &gt;51%.
They'd just need to pull simultaneous shenanigans in each. Which is easy because they control both pools.
Just like a when a corporate monopoly gets "broken up".

You heard that right. It's a violation of civil rights to let women get banged on camera for money. Hope they don't find out about camgirls. They masturbate on webcam - we need to stop them before their rights become further oppressed.
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:07:14
Nothing. Bitcoin isn't about credibility tests.
Better to leave it transparent. If a pool gets to 51%, it's best left transparent so people can abandon ship to get it below 50%, or tar and feather the operators if they pull some shenanigans.

It's called salting. There's some random bits/bytes added to the front of the password you type. Depending on implementation, this "salt" can be stored with the hash (this foils rainbow tables, because you would need to show up with a set of tables for each salt, but doesn't slow down brute force attempts because the salt is known to an attacker) or brute forced every time you legitimately enter the password. Mac OS, for example, salts with 4 bytes that are stored with the hash. To go after a Mac OS password hash with rainbow tables, you would need to have 2^32 versions of your tables, one for each salt. Each password has a different salt, completely negating rainbow tables.
EDIT: Note, that this does *not at all* slow down a direct, single-target brute force, but it severely limits the attacker's productivity because he can only target one hash at a time, rather than a whole batch of hashes and hoping to hit at least one every now and then. This makes much less profitable to go after passphrase hashes.
EDIT 2: As pointed out below, I went brain-dead and didn't realize that the hash isn't stored. Rainbow tables and batch brute force attacks are 100% useless against encrypted wallets.
@_date: 2013-04-20 13:11:55
Wow, you're right. Derp.
Rainbow tables are 100% useless against encrypted wallets. End of story.
@_date: 2013-02-14 23:40:45
Yes. Absolutely.
Men are allowed to bang on camera. Women aren't. Letting them would violate their rights and be a step away from equality.
