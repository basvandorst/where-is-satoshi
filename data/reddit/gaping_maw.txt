So my .14 of a Bitcoin will have a fee of approx 10% of its value? What makes the transaction so large and can I reduce it somehow?
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:03:57
Ok thanks. Could you explain what you mean by 'with that many inputs'? Do you mean because its a low amount or is it something to do with the mining. Should I download the complete blockchain to my wallet?

Sorry I don't understand. I've already sent the transaction with the too low fee (nov 28) and it hasn't been confirmed. I don't mind waiting another month or more if that's what it takes just not sure what to do now to get it back? Its been over a month and hasn't been dropped.

Hi mate, sent the pm last night. I have now confirmed the transaction is abanoned after downloading the blockchain. Whats the next step in consolidating the inputs?
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:53:48
I just went through this. They stay separate, to consolidate they need to be spent together in another transaction similar to swapping coins at the bank for a note, for a fee.

Thanks for the explanation. I'm in no rush I would even be happy waiting a week or more but not if its never going to transfer like u/Keefryan thinks. What do you think?

Thanks for the tip, what the heck does it mean?
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:45:48
Hopefully it comes back to me, once the blockchain updates I'll keep the wallet offline, 2 years 50 weeks to go....

Thanks I'm using the Bitcoin core wallet so it supports RBF and I have done the research but still a bit confused. Can I still try RBF if the wallet balance is 0? Also, will the old transaction be credited back to the wallet when it is dropped?

Not looking for the fastest, looking for the slowest (cheapest) that will actually work. I only have .14 of a btc
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:20:08
Ok thanks. How much should I have set for the fee?
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:09:39
What? Im just looking for advice as I dont know much about it. How is that arrogant? I still dont know what an appropriate fee is for my .14 btc. I appreciate the tips not sure why your angry. I have been polite in all my responses your reaction is bizarre.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:53:42
I received the btc from approx 220 transactions from mining. Im trying to read up on how many bytes that is but its over my head. Am I right that those mining transactions will determine the fee for the transfer from my wallet to the exchange?
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:19:02
This is nonsense. You don't need to be smart to know something like that.

Sometimes I wonder how much energy in total that has been wasted wondering how much energy in total has been wasted?  Do you guys imagine it has caused a lot of co2 emissions?
@_date: 2019-01-28 03:36:36
OK thanks.

Just read it you don't need to try and guess the meaning. The tweet is very clear and 100% true.
They are trying to get attention by subtly tricking you into thinking they mean first ever and it's working great.
OP's title is the reason everyone's getting confused.
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:00:16
Thats definately not australian, thats pommy
@_date: 2019-01-28 03:11:31
It doesn't say first ever, it says first ever at that dispensary guys. Technically true.
@_date: 2019-01-28 13:15:17
Cheers appreciate the help
@_date: 2019-01-28 04:08:43
OK great. I tried that during a busy period six months ago and ended up having to reverse the transaction because no one picked it up. Wasn't super easy as the tx are on bitcoin core wallet. Been waiting for a better time.
@_date: 2019-01-28 03:33:04
Cheers. What should be I aiming for with the tx fee?
@_date: 2019-01-28 04:09:13
Cheers will get onto it.
