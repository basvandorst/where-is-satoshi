Why does half of the posts in KotakuInAction cry about feminism and SJW if it has nothing to do with the fact that they're women?  That is the most blatantly intellectually dishonest thing I've read, and that says a lot considering I'm currently posting on a pro-cryptocurrency subreddit!
Explain that?

Why are you attacking her motives and not her conduct?  That seems like the most disingenuous way to go about arguing about anything, ever.

Well since I don't want you to accuse me of putting words in your mouth, I'll let you tell me what about Anita makes gamers so upset if it's not the fact that she politely brings up very real issues of sexism in gaming.

Sensationalist?  Shallow?


Spell it out for me.

Interesting that there is no context to anything in that video!

Cool no reason for Anita to be a target other than she's a woman by your own words then.
You are basically saying gamers are too immature to not be bothered by someone who isn't even accusing them of anything.

My mind is pretty made up because I don't understand how a 10 minute video is going to justify a multi-year hate campaign against someone who just so... coincidentally? is speaking from a feminist viewpoint.

Normally people give you an idea of what you're expecting to hear.  I'm not watching a 10 minute video just to find a bunch of twisted truths and outright lies without some clue as to what the video's message is.
