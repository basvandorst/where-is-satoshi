What are altar exactly? As I said I'm very new to this so sorry if it sounds like a dumb question. Also what is Gemini used for exactly I made an account but didn't go through with completing it as it asked for social security and I wanted to make sure it was safe place to use before I went on with it.

Ok thank you for clarifying on Gemini I feel better about using it now. I just downloaded Bitcoin armory on my computer to be my Bitcoin wallet. So to be sure I can purchase through gemini then send those coins to my wallet at the time it will take to go to my wallet is a few days or so?

This is somewhat how I explained the benefits of Bitcoin and she agreed now I just need to start actually getting bitcoins. And she wants the whole family to be involved.

Yea I haven't even been able to start because I was waiting so long to validate identity on gemini.

I love posts like these! Im very new to the whole thing and just made a wallet with electrum and an account on gemini to start getting into crypto when i start making more money. And I am trying to absorb as much information as I possibky can before then.

So basically a hot fucking mess. And didn't Bitcoin go back up shortly after?
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:26:07
Would you able to explain to me what is going on? I've been trying to educate my self more on bitcoins these last few months. But I'm kinda confused on what is happening right now.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:11:35
Exactly what I needed while I'm off for a week from work.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:51:32
So why not try educating some of us or pointing us to places where we can learn? Doesn't more people using the currency  help increase the value as it circulates? 
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:19:09
Why not just use a wallet?
