Do you know how to do custom fees when transferring from coinbase to ledger?

So I am dumb and left my ether, lite, and btc in coinbase. What wallet should I move my stuff too, unfortunately I lost my potential bch, but live and learn  I guess
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:13:58
So in a sense, btc can eventually replace or upgrade credit cards?

Are there always network fees when sending/transferring cyrpto currency?

My norton keeps removing the setup for electrum because it detects it as a virus. How do I know it's safe to use?
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:42:27
Oh okay. I'll need to look up more about capital gains tax. Thanks for the explanation. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:55:19
Can you explain to me in a scenario please, I have hard time with understand concepts. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:16:22
From what I know. Unless you convert btc to money there is no tax. If say you had 1 btc you bought for 5000 and you convert to cash at 7000, that 2000 will be taxed. If however you use that bitcoin you bought at 5000 and buy something when the price is 7000 with bitcoin there is no tax.

Say you have an electrum wallet, then yes you can transfer from coinbase to that wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:25:25
I don't use that, but I'm sure it would work. On coinbase go to send bitcoin and copy the wallet address you want to send to and send how much ever you want. Just make sure the wallet you are transferring to is legit and isn't a scam.

Coinbase is exchange like an IOU. Say for example 100 people want to withdraw their 1000 btc from coinbase, and coinbase only has like 5000 btc in their storages, how will they do that? There's no guarantee that coinbase has everyone's btc stored in their accounts at any given time. You also aren't control of your private keys, coinbase is. People are scared to trust exchanges because of the Mt. Gox scandal, if you don't know what it is then look it up.

Is moving my btc from coinbase to blockchain fine? And should I leave my alt coins in coinbase or no?  
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:49:27
Where did you buy this from? 
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:58:05
I have btc in coinbase, is it safe to leave there? I know I shouldn't leave on an exchange regardless, but I am waiting to get a hardware
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:52:33
My coins are in Coinbase, are they safe from forks  if I transfer them to blockchain

One of the top posts on that sub is a 19 yo, asking advice to grow $10k quickly, I typically don't comment but I thought it would be interesting to see if others agreed or not. Guess not. I also don't read subreddit rules often so guess it's my fault  
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:48:00
Do you have any recommendations for hardware wallets, is blockchain not good wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:52:55
Wait.  I wanna get one. How
@_date: 2017-10-01 04:01:14
I have questions: if I transfer my btc from coinbase to blockchain wallet, am I good? I also have ether and litecoin on coinbase, what should I do about those. I hate having multiple wallets for each alt coin, is there one that supports all three like coinbase? 
Edit: also when will this event happen
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:47:04
Thanks for confidence and late response. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 04:50:30
What is electrum
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:16:43
If I put in hardware I won't get the 2x coins?
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:05:11
Perhaps we can implement a strategy to minimize the effects of shills? We could make the down vote button not an option or have no effect, have a minimum karma limit or timer for a person with low account activity, I know many other subs use these methods to prevent alt account to manipulate whether or not a post is seen
