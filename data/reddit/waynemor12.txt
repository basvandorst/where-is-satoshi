While that is not happening to me, I would reach out to support (if you haven't already). 
Prepare for long wait times though.

The OP seems to be using coinbase, not GDAX.  Free maker orders beats Gemini, but there are exchanges that offer rebates for makers but I prefer sticking with exchanges that have been established.

Kinda hoping for this myself.  Or finex shares that I get a dividend from quarterly.  
Of course there's the problem of how much businesses they will be doing in the coming months as well, things will be slow until they can be prove their security again which will take time plus many will be once bitten but twice shy (understandably)

Correct.   But if your not trading often it isn't wise to keep bitcoin anywhere where you don't own the private keys.
@_date: 2016-08-02 10:00:12
From what I understand if you want to earn some btc for ads then you'll have to give information to them so they can meet KYC and AML requirements.
However there is an option for you to just give all earnings back to the sites you visit.  This doesn't need any personal info.

As for what you can do with them, I'm unsure.  The least I've spent on something is 0.06 BTC.  I'm sure someone will make a suggestion but I'd say hold on to them for now. No need to spend them right away.

Currently brave does not have bitcoin integrated into the software yet, but they claim that is coming soon™.
Further more please keep in mind that if you wish to keep the BTC brave earns you (which I'm assuming won't be a ton of money, but hey I'll take any "free" bits from my web surfing) you will need to provide information to brave before withdrawing. 
All that said, I'm still looking forward to the browser and I hope they shake up the browser space, time will tell.

@_date: 2016-04-30 06:15:34
First off you have a very very nice friend.  There are many people who don't have hardware wallets or keep their funds with exchanges/"bitcoin banks" who have far more BTC then you.   
As for your fee problem, your going to want more BTC to play with in general.  I'd suggest grabbing ~$10 to $20 worth of you want to send it to wallets you've made or maybe buy something.      Current average fee is about 10400 Satoshi's (about 4 cents or .000104 BTC) anything lower then that your looking at long confirm times for your transaction (not forever, just most likely not in the next block). Plus nothing feels worse then having a stuck transaction, and you don't want to start your bitcoin joinery that way.
So with that all said, there really isn't much point in sending a small amount as fees will make that impractical and long confirmation times would make low fee transactions equally impractical.  Buy some BTC from your friend and mess around then :)

Same reason as always.  KYC and AML regulations.  However you only need to provide information if you plan on withdrawing funds to a private wallet.  You will also have the option to donate to your favorite websites which will not require any information from you.

There is a chance of losing everything.  Please consider this first before investing into anything ever.
If you do decide to buy though please do not keep your coin/coins on an exchange.  Move them to a personal wallet / cold storage.  There are a ton of posts asking how to safely store bitcoin.  The key to remember here is if you don't own the private key you do not own the bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-30 08:19:26
Good deal on that Trezor! If you ever get sick of it I'll give you 40$ for it ;)
 
Keep in mind that fees change depending on how full blocks are at that time.  However 4 cents really isn't that much, you can do 100 transactions for $4.  For 4 cents you can send any amount of BTC to anyone on the planet that has a wallet and has shared a bitcoin address with you.  4 cents isn't really that much, however I understand where your coming from. You want to understand the system before actually using it.  Smart, however you will need to eat the costs at first.  
A good idea might be too move some bits to another wallet that lets you choose the fee, Trezor is more for child storage anyways.  I wish I had a wallet to suggest to you.  However I do have a link that may assist you if you do find a wallet that lets you choose your fee:

There is a whole world to investing and day trading with bitcoin.  Most go with the buy and hodl (hold) strategy, but most people who have bitcoin are hoping to increase the amount of wealth they have.
I'd suggest looking further into bitcoin and understanding it before throwing anymore money into it.  And please keep in mind price can easily move in either direction.  There are no guarantees, just tons of hopeium and trolls.  Good luck and enjoy the ride.

So one Troy oz to one coin?  Or equal value of both.  For example $200 of litecoin and $200 in silver?
Just curious :)
@_date: 2016-04-30 08:26:26
I'm hoping something like that comes out soon myself.  However I'd want the entire account running off BTC.  Would love getting dividends in BTC and having all stocks denominated in BTC as well.  Would be neat not needing to convert to fiat, however I don't see it happening for a long time. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 00:49:10
I happen to like the novelty of the idea.  While I agree it does take away arguably one of the best assets of bitcoin, I think physical coins can help bridge the gap plus they make great conversation pieces.  Some of the physical bitcoins look amazing as well.   But it's not for everyone.

Your view of crypto-currencies is a little Limited.  Eventually we should be able to program our money.  Effectively making smart contracts that could be used for mortgages or loans.  Probably have Smart contracts that act like savings accounts too.

The price is so high now it's starting to affect the price in the past, making it higher.  Fascinating.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:08:01
Are you buying because you saw the price went up and you want to make money?
Have you been following bitcoin? What about litecoin?  Ethereum? 
Before investing into anything you should understand how it works.
Also make sure, and I mean really make sure that you're all right with losing all the money you put into cryptocurrency, it's a risky asset and by no means a sure bet.  
With all that said there is amazing upside potential on many cons out there but no one here has a crystal ball to tell you which one would be best for you to invest in right now.  
Best advice I have would be finding exchange that sells multiple coins are interested in and put an equal amount in all of them.
Best of luck!
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:53:19

@_date: 2017-12-13 07:29:23
It's all personal preference. 
Currently you don't have control over the keys of your Litecoin or Bitcoin.  This means you don't control them, so really once you start feeling nervous about your crypto being under somebody else's control, that's when you should get a hardware wallet or look into creating secure paper wallets.

Also to add, coinbase support might be the better option for support here, they can actually look into your account.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:46:16
Ledger has a browser-based interface it uses.  It should be very safe to use, safer than mycelium on your phone for sure.
Just make sure you look at the addresses when sending and receiving Bitcoin. I believe Ledger has an option to view addresses on your Nano S, use this to make sure your sending to the correct address.  
But you should be fine.  Do not worry :)

No your wallet never sends your private key.  Instead it uses your public key to sign the transaction.  Due to very complicated math I don't understand, this somehow provides proof you own the private key to that address.
Here is some reading if you want the technical details:
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:59:45
Honestly I never looked into them myself, I just know of them because of all the verification required to buy or sell crypto on any exchange these days in the United States.
And you'd be surprised at the lengths criminals will go through to clean dirty money.  You may think 1,000 and $2,000 is a small amount but if accounts are free, you can just keep opening a new account and slowly convert dirty money into clean bitcoin.  Hence the regulations.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:28:07
Ok fine, new goal.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:57:02
The system is designed to find a block every 10 minutes. Blocks have limited space so when there are many transactions that can cause delays.   So while more users would typically mean more transactions, there are also Bad actors that will "spam" the network with transactions to cause trouble.  Lightning should resolve this issue and help scale.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:14:48
Try this. It's free and has helped me out a few times.
Just know that they only accelerate the first 100 transactions that are submitted every hour, and you have to wait for that mining pool to find a block after they accelerate your transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:29:08
A hardware wallet combines relative ease of use with good safety.
Creating a paper wallet on an air-gapped computer will give you just as much security, but it's more complicated and a novice could mess up the process.  It's far cheaper though :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:58:00
Possibly. ISPs could limit button traffic or Bitcoin sites.  But I feel like there are enough cleaver people in the crypto space too figure out a work around in those cases.  
Hopefully we won't have to worry about it at all.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:47:45
As the other user said, it's a exchange, so your trading with other people rather than buying directly from coinbase.
I suggest using YouTube to become familiar with the interface and the sites functions before diving into it. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:45:55
You should always be very paranoid when it comes to bitcoin.  So I commend you not blindly trusting me.
So this is just a transaction accelerator, you take your transaction ID and put it in that box.  Your transaction ID is public knowledge there's nothing in it that can be used to steal your Bitcoin or hack you. So you have nothing to fear.
Viabtc is just a Bitcoin mining pool, I believe they came out with this service as a way to gain publicity when blocks started getting full.  They only accelerate the first 100 transactions submitted every hour, after that you have to wait until the next hour starts.  Members of this pool (service?  Unsure about this part) can use the transaction accelerator at any time with no restrictions.  
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:54:18
I wonder if it's only wire transfers.  Interesting.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:37:38
Ok good you have a transaction ID at least.  This means the problem is with the network and not coinbase. Your transaction is just stuck due to the amount of unconfirmed transactions currently. It will confirm, though it is unfortunate it is taking so long.  
Only thing you can do is wait.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:22:35
Yes, there is a site that lists the public keys for those coins using the first bits.   Sorry I'm on mobile and don't have it in hand =\
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:02:56
I'd say it's typical.  You have to figure out of all the whales some of them want to cash out at this price point. Gdax has the amazing attribute of having no fees for market makers which makes it ideal to sell large amounts with no fees.  And when you're talking millions of dollars those fees add up.
PS: Order books are fun to watch.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:31:11
Hoping there are more people like you out there.
But we can at least say there is plus one more Bitcoiners due to this price rise.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:16:34
Ledger is a fantastic company, sadly I don't have any of their products but I may pick one up in the future.
That said if there's any major Bitcoin Fork that has any kind of value to it, I'm certain Ledger will support it.  But in an event that they don't there are workarounds, but it wouldn't involve importing your private key into another wallet which could compromise your key. (It increases the risk, I don't suggest it at all)
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:24:10
So I can see why someone would want to time the market if buying with a large sum, however you're now making two Gambles, hope the price drops so you can get in lower and get more BTC, but you also risk it never returning to that price point again. 
If you look at the entire history of Bitcoin making a large purchase all at once seems to be the most profitable.  However I would definitely say we're in uncharted waters with the substantial growth that we have faced this year.  
Personally I would buy a set amount each week. Or each day.  Less slippage and cost averaging (if any swings happen).   
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:49:18
Even then they may still be left with a great sum.  But who knows! (I don't)
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:28:33
High amount of transactions, and most likely coinbase falling behind with withdrawals, they are getting crushed by the recent surge in clients.  Do you have a transaction ID?
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:52:39
I'm not sure about a  release date, but it might take awhile for the network to build itself.  For instance segwit has been out for a long time and there are still services that have an integrated it yet.
Lightning should lower fees, and allow us to scale better but we will have to wait and see.
Litecoin is planning on releasing lightning Network Q1 of 2018 I believe so we can see the effects and how it runs.  I'm sure other coins will adopt it as well before bitcoin.

The price of Bitcoin is based on what people are willing to pay for it.  Currently there's a lot of people speculating that it is going to be worth more than it is now and they're willing to pay the current price for that reason.  There are also people that believe in the technology and we'll be holding onto Bitcoin no matter what the price is.  These people are outnumbering those who are selling which is why the price is going up, though at the time of this post some people are dumping their coins and diving the price down.
Bitcoin has a finite cap of 21 million coins, of that 21 million 16,700,000 have been minted. So while currently there are 12 and a half Bitcoins made every 10 minutes, this with tamper down every 4 years until we reach the 21 million cap.  Basically the vast majority of coins will most likely be mined by the year 2032.  
TL;DR: more people are buying and selling which is driving up the price, Bitcoin has a finite Supply so while more are being created, inflation is going to drop as time goes on. 
Edit: fixed a word
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:56:31
Essentially it's Bitcoins been removed from the network.  Making the amount of available coins even more limited.  Eventually bitcoin users are going to start dying and if they don't have systems in place to pass on their Bitcoins those Bitcoins will also be lost.

OP you sound like your trying to time the market.  Save yourself some worry and just buy now.  Not one person here knows for certain anything about where the price of Bitcoin is going.  
If you believe in it and want to hold onto it to support the tech, buy.
If you believe it's going to go up (much more than it is right now) then buy.
If neither of those two things are true and you just want to spark some interesting conversations, ignore me and have a wonderful night.

The limits are based on know your customer and anti-money laundering regulations.  Most of which has nothing to do with coinbase, but with the regulations that coinbase is forced to follow.  The more verification you provide the higher your limits should be.  The limits have nothing to do with your credit card limit or credit score.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:26:18
Greetings and good question.
The answer is maybe. It depends on if your HW wallet supports the new forked coin or not.  There are a few forks now and there will be many more in the future.  It might be impossible to keep up with them in the future.  This goes for exchanges as well.  But as long as you have access to your private key, you may be able to import your private key into another wallet that does support a new forked coin.
Basically it's the private key that gives you access to the newly forked chain, so as long as you have ownership of your private key (you give that up when your on a exchange) you will have access to cons on any newly created fork of bitcoin.

The fact that your ID was expired triggered their system.  I used to work at a web hosting company and you would not believe the attempts people would make to try to pass off photoshopped IDs or even expired IDs as legitament.  It was just bad luck.
The only work around I can think of is using a different Exchange that you have access to in the meantime.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:56:38
No problem! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:19:31
I'm very optimistic.  I don't pretend to know how difficult the processes of upgrading a multibillion-dollar decentralized network is.  But I'm certain they will figure it out.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:23:47
Network is clogged. Give it time and it will confirm.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:00:27
I'd question where you got that scam information from.  Coinbase is a established business and most likely the best on ramp for those wanting to aquire more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:51:37
Well welcome :)
The point I was trying to make is there's always a reason for Bitcoin to be volatile.  The price is highly speculative and we're going to be in a price Discovery phase for a very long time so expect a lot more volatility as time goes on.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:25:03
When you say recently exactly what do you mean?  Generally takes a few days for Bitcoin to show up after a purchase on coinbase.
Also what does your account history say? Does it show your Bitcoin purchase yet?
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:08:50
Don't get fired over Bitcoin.  Enjoy the ride
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:36:17
Well they can be pulled at any moment.  
I think of it as chess between whales.

@_date: 2017-12-06 00:06:14
Well what are you planning on using your Bitcoins for?  I think having a reasonable amount (a amount you wouldn't mind losing for instance) on your phone would be fine, make sure you have some kind of backup for your wallet in case your phone gets lost stolen or broken. 
I would probably avoid mentioning you have any amount of Bitcoin on your phone unless it's needed to show a friend you trust or pay a merchant.
I think the future will see a lot more interesting Hardware wallets and probably even debit cards or other services that tie into Bitcoin.   
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:20:02
Assuming the trend holds of course. Crazy to think that's just from one BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:14:01
This was my answer
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:34:19
Example: you bought for $100 and sold for 1000.  Your going to be taxed on the $900 profit you made.
This all assumes your in America.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:43:51
They only speed up 100 transactions per hour and it's on a first-come first-serve basis.  Put you are transaction ID in the box and send it when a new hour rolls around.
You'll have to wait for them to find a block but you should be included in it if you were one of the 100 to accelerate your transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:45:56
Well Miners and hashrate are the same thing.  If minors are shut off there will be a temporary dip in hash power which would in turn cause transactions to be slower because not as many blocks are being found.  The other side of that though is if there are more minors being turned on then blocks maybe found faster which would cause transactions to clear faster.  So hashrate does directly affect how many transactions are confirmed.
You are correct though, it should take the same amount of time to solve a block no matter how many transactions are in it whether it's one or thousands.  The miners are incentive advised to include as many as they can because they want to collect the fees.
Currently the limiting factor is the block size, there a lot of scaling options in development however that should fix this problem.  Also segwit has it been fully adopted by everyone yet, once that happens transactions per second most likely go up.  But I believe lightning will be the most impactful on transactions per second.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:46:36
ATMs generally have higher fees, and can require some identification.
Exchanges generally need to verify you which can take a week or so and ask for a lot of identifying information. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:00:43
Extremely frustrating.  I'm Sorry to hear that.
Let me know if you have any questions about GDAX, I don't be happy to answer them.
Edit: I sound like such a coinbase shill these days&gt;
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:38:33
Greetings!  Personally I think your brave.  I wouldn't trust a buyer on eBay either selling any high value item.  But I'm naturally paranoid.  I wish you luck with the sale!
I really wanted a Titan silver half but they sold out :(
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:00:15
There is a whole market for things like this (Cassius coins being very iconic in this space) but buying them from a no body off eBay is just asking to get scammed. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:47:53
Many people copy the Bitcoin blockchain and make Forks of Bitcoin.  Two outs possible I don't know how easy it is.  
But the hard part would be gaining traction and a user base for your cryptocurrency, without users your currency would have no practical value.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:12:34
Let's hope development solves this problem.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:17:12
Hardware wallet software is designed to be efficient with the inputs that it chooses.  It doesn't choose them by the order that they arrived, instead it tries to make the smallest transaction possible (size wise, or in bytes)
So to make an example for you, let's say you want to send 20 Bitcoins to a friend, you received 10.5 Bitcoins 5 Bitcoins, another 5 Bitcoins and 10.01 Bitcoins at the wallet your sending from.  The wallet would take the two 10 BTC inputs and send them out.
Edit: replaced some words with better words.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:39:46
This is the correct answer.  If you're not familiar with exchanges use YouTube to learn how to use GDAX.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:33:14
It's a taxable event. Since it's from 2014 your going to pay long term capital gains (it's slightly less % than short term) on what ever profits you made. (Total amount you sold for - original cost)
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:30:48
Good luck!  I really hope it becomes successful :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:36:42
It's money, and I'm sure you like having money.  I'd be nervous too.
Give it time, network is just clogged currently.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:45:33
The Bitcoin mining system self adjust its difficulty depending on the total hashrate so that blocks are found every 10 minutes on average.  So the amount of miners really doesn't matter in terms of transaction volume as the system is designed to adjust to any increase or decrease in hash rate. 
 Instead the scaling solutions that are currently being developed will be what allows the network to increase the amount of transactions it can process.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:10:56
Even if everyone used Segwit Bitcoin fees would still sky rocket during major price moves.  Lightning is what we need to help reduce network load.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:19:43
I welcome any and all exchanges that compete.  Consumers can only benefit from such a thing.  Sadly owning and operating a Bitcoin exchange is not an easy thing to do in the United States, so I'm not counting on someone usurping coinbase anytime soon.  
Unfortunately for a service with as many users as coinbase has scaling the platform is probably a huge headache. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:32:44
I'm not sure all of them do!  But I personally have one that does.  Some sites might give you the remainder as a credit in your account.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:00:48
So full nodes have a few responsibilities.  Nodes keep unverified transactions in the mempool, and they also hold the entire blockchain history.  Nodes are essential to keep the Bitcoin Network alive and functioning.
Having your own phone owed means you don't have to trust somebody else's node. Essentially you know the information you have is correct because it's coming from your own node.  Where as somebody could orchestrate and attack and have you connecting with a malicious node.  This would be a very complicated man in the middle attack and the chances of something like this happening are very slim so it's not really something you should worry about.
Unfortunately I don't have any resources on how to build a node, but luckily there are many guides and Hardware suggestions out there online that you could follow if you wish to make a node.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:25:34
That's a tricky area, I would still record the trade for your records because I wouldn't put it past the IRS or whatever your tax Authority is to come asking questions in the future.
But I'm the paranoid type
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:23:48
Careful. OP, that's a dangerous amount to announce.
As for your question I would seek professional help.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:04:48
Users will care more when gdax has withdraw fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:30:36
Do you have a transaction ID?
It's possible that gdax is having technical difficulties, It's highly probable however that the transaction backlog is the cause to your delay. There are a few people posting about delayed transactions from gdax and coinbase tonight.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:33:19
Look into using GDAX, It's an exchange owned by coinbase.
The fees are smaller and transferring Bitcoin away from the exchange you free.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:58:47
There are many many exchanges that are selling Bitcoins for much higher than 10000 a coin.  Unfortunately I don't know exactly who these people are but they exist and they are trading Bitcoin at very high volumes so there must be at least two of them.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:56:05
It's the latter, it's like a race, first 100 to put in their transaction win!  
So for instance in about 4 minutes you'll want to try to get in to The next batch.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:59:25
Proud of you OP.  Good going.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:42:03
You can tell the bitcoin is going to come back after the three minutes this post has been on Reddit?
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:51:37
Coinbase is unfortunately required to follow us laws and regulations.  I'm certain that this has to do with know your customer or anti-money-laundering regulations.  It's unfortunate but coinbase has no choice in the matter, you'll have to wait until you submit your ID again before you can buy.
I suggest taking this time to look into coinbase Exchange gdax.  Cheaper fees and better rates on crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:04:52
Never used them. Is this typical fees?  
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:38:52
At the start of every new hour this mining pool will accelerate the first 100 transactions submitted to it.  It is first come first serve, but you might be able to get this transaction verified using this service.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:37:52
I'm certain this will increase adoption....
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:22:29
Well as you said that's all personal choice.  If you feel strongly about a specific coin go all in, do you want to bet on the crypto Market as a whole spread out your funds.  Or maybe do weekly buys and rotate between a few coins.   
Regardless welcome to the club, enjoy the ride :)
@_date: 2015-12-30 08:32:13
I hope the same! :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:13:35
Hmmm interesting. Do you have a computer you can try to use?
I'm not super familiar with ledger nano S and what they give you.  Maybe reach out to ledger support if your having issues?
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:56:26
You can't afford it?  If you don't have money to spare than don't buy, focus on getting to a point where you can start buying again.
If you have extra funds but when you can for what you can spare.
I don't have any faucet sites to share sorry :(
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:44:22

@_date: 2017-12-06 01:11:37
Unfortunately I can't offer any advice on creative solutions, but if there is a will there is a way.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:05:01
Well if Bitcoin is going to be more popular in the future then your way ahead of the game even now.  But that assumes bitcoin stays on top and relevant as time goes on.
Also a friendly tip, try not to mention how much Bitcoin you have. While it may seem like a small amount now not worth a lot  it can easily become a very large amount in the future.  You might be setting yourself up to be hacked is all.  Stay safe :)
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:15:47
Mastering bitcoin is a very in depth book and I would recommend it, although it's very technical.  Even still it has a lot of good information in it.

Id buy one, but then again I love silver.
I'm sure the future will bring all sorts of cool hardware wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:53:58
I believe you'd need a wallet.dat file or the private key from your original Bitcoin core wallet.  If you don't have either you won't be able to access your previous bitcoin balance.
@_date: 2015-12-12 17:48:26
Agreed as well.  
Looking at the problem from a black and white perspective of using bitcoin directly and using fiat isn't the way to go.  Bitcoin still needs time to grow and will (and currently does) need to work along side fiat until it is more established and excepted everywhere.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:10:18
Sorry, that was supposed to say "users"
 
And yes you are correct, as long as you have control over your private keys you'll have control over your Bitcoins.
But not everyone has a plan in place to pass on their coins.  Inevitably coins will be lost as time goes on.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:03:35
Also take time to understand the tech behind the price if you haven't yet.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:14:26
I wish you the best of luck :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:28:52
Every exchange will have its own price depending on that market and the exchanges fees, or how trustworthy it is.  
Coinbase generally inflates the price of Bitcoin and also charges a fee, that's how they make their profits.
As was suggested try using gdax, you can use limit orders (please learn what these are before using them. ) This makes you a market-maker and there are no fees.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:56:18
To add to this, currently a Satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin, this can be changed in the future however so even if a Satoshi was worth $20,000 we could still function.
@_date: 2015-12-17 07:08:44
I want to know the person that (hopefully) puts a stop to it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:27:06
They accelerate 100 transactions per hour on a first-come-first-serve basis.  Get in early or wait another hour.
You also have to wait for them to find a block after you accelerate.
Good luck!!
@_date: 2015-12-23 08:09:38
Get more time please, that works be cool :)

I'm a coinfire man myself, ever sense someone tested all the big bitcoin "news" sites.  They were one of the few sites that wouldn't accept money (they outright refused to) to post an article.  
@_date: 2014-12-12 19:49:41
Thanks for the heads up!  Been waiting for this to come out on kindle for a while.
@_date: 2014-08-20 21:57:04
It begins
@_date: 2014-11-12 03:26:57
Some crazy event would have to happen.  To many bitcoins in to many hands these days to not see any sell orders, even more so at those prices given all the hodlers that are praying for a price swing to get out of the red.
Just my 2bits on the topic :)
@_date: 2014-12-11 21:03:25
Hmmm seems reasonable.  I'll just put my head back in the sand then.
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:41:16
Been around this sub for months and I love the community.  Charge tip is arguably the best tool given to bitcoin to spread awareness.  
Keep it up everyone!  :)
Edit:  posting from phone makes me look silly.  Charge tip =\= ChangeTip 
@_date: 2014-12-25 03:20:20
*Engage sarcasm*
Woo! movies mentioning bitcoins being used for illegal purposes.
The stereotype lives on :D

New and just wanting a medium to gather news on bitcoin, and also read into the insight of others as well,  the more information the better :D

It's only just starting too, much more excitement and advancement ahead of us :)
@_date: 2014-08-19 04:29:37
Do you buy cars for bitcoin?  :D
@_date: 2014-12-07 08:44:00
Honestly? Price.  I'm waiting for it to get cheaper before I buy one.  I love the idea but the price point isn't where I'd like it to be.  
@_date: 2014-12-17 08:26:17
This is exactly what I'm waiting for.  Trezor is awesome but the price point is not.  $50 is what I'd like to see it at, or any other competitor that enters the market in the future.  
Of course for anyone with a large amount of bitcoin I think the Trezor is perfect, just can't justify it for myself.
@_date: 2014-12-12 02:58:11
Thank you!  You didn't have to do that. Will pay this forward :)

Still love coinbase, glad to see advancement at any exchange though.   Hope to see more from you guys, I know your reading this ;)

Wonder what's next
@_date: 2014-10-10 05:23:46
Just today I talked to two people and both were surprised to hear you can break bitcoins up into smaller parts.   
Clearly something needs to be done here
@_date: 2014-12-13 06:25:31
Completely agree.   It can't happen fast enough.
"Shut up and take my bitcoin!"
Was going to say bits but it came off far more dirty then I wanted.
@_date: 2014-12-31 08:36:48
Wouldn't have expected that in that type of book. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 01:16:51
I always saved, bitcoin just gave me a great place to put part of those savings
@_date: 2014-10-10 05:26:43
Lol this.  Very funny
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:37:33
I like where bitcoin is headed at the end of the graph, I'm thinking good things ahead. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 00:27:53
You and everyone else ( that is smart) Mr. Sign
@_date: 2014-12-05 21:26:26
Or maybe he only bid on one block?  
@_date: 2014-07-10 03:49:02
What would be do with a bitcoin indeed
@_date: 2014-11-14 00:45:22
I don't Facebook myself, guess I'm not allowed in :(

Any other dream prices?  Recently?
@_date: 2017-02-16 16:51:02
I'd argue it's the market worried about the ETF.  Will be interesting to see
@_date: 2017-02-03 02:07:58
Or it might reveal some potential pitfalls.  I'm not against segwit, I'm really hoping this will clear the air a bit.
@_date: 2014-08-12 14:41:41
CommVenus, please let me know when you plan to buy so I can sell.  Thank you :)

Happy holidays to everyone :)

My Hope Is that the price runs straight through too 1.3k and then no one will have to debate it

Cass coins used to sell for about double their value, however as bitcoin's price rose, that premium shifted down a bit.  I would suggest going to Bitcointalk.org and checking the market area under collectables.  There are many Cass coin enthusiast and I'm sure they'll be able to help you find a price and maybe even find yourself a buyer there.
Congrats on the find, wish I bought one and randomly found it in my room.
Also get a case for it if you don't have one.  The better the quality, the better the price.
@_date: 2017-02-06 05:40:40
Honestly no idea though.  It will be interesting to see.
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:39:32
Happy to hear your moving on to greater and better things.  Thank you for all your great work and I wish you the best of luck :)

@_date: 2017-02-16 05:42:46
Market place &gt; goods &gt; collectables
Great place to find out what crypto coins are selling for
@_date: 2017-02-05 05:38:19
No one you want to pass them onto?  I'm just curious.
@_date: 2017-02-24 05:18:54
So to clarify, this isn't TA.  What your seeing are two charts, price history (top) and the order book (bottom).
From the way it plays out, it looks like the sell wall was starting to get chipped away by small orders, then a large order came in and bought all the remaining BTC there.
@_date: 2017-02-09 02:42:29
Such cool coins.  I wish he could make coins again.  There are many others making coins but the Cass boat has sailed.
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:20:41

@_date: 2017-02-07 13:25:28
How brave someone must be to make a bitcoin price prediction.
@_date: 2017-02-22 22:32:57
That's the progressive thinking we need around here.
@_date: 2017-02-18 06:31:58
If you own any make sure to have a safe storage method.  Also back ups too.
Have fun!

So many down votes in that thread, on both sides of the spectrum too, from Bitcoin lovers to Bitcoin haters.  
Really strange. Wonder what we will be looking back on in 5 years. Wish I knew :)

Government forced him to stop.   He could still make DIY coins I'm sure, but I'm betting he has moved onto other projects.

Would wind power ever play a hand?  I would do both if I could to cover all the bases I can if I'm mining.  Much rather have as much uptime as I can to help keep the network secure.
@_date: 2014-12-06 18:17:38
But I lost all my coins!  This can't be MY fault, otherwise I have to live with the guilt.  
@_date: 2016-01-28 06:10:36
I don't think you would want that.

Either way, get me a cheeseburger and a milkshake while your out.  Oh and some cheap bitcoins too.

I'll sell some of mine if you want some.  Just 1k each.  Let me know how many you want :)
@_date: 2016-03-30 08:01:03
Yea that really pissed me off, the idea was neat and I would have loved to have the clock but sadly it turned out to be a scam.  I sent them 3 emails for a refund and never heard back until I contacted my credit card company and filled a charge back.
2 days later they contacted me and sent me bitcoin as a refund.  Very annoying.
@_date: 2015-05-03 09:28:29
I'll hold you to that :)
@_date: 2016-03-26 08:26:02
Soon ™
@_date: 2016-03-20 07:50:31
I believe (not 100% sure on this). That other exchanges already have this option.   However I do not see how this can hurt bitcoin price in the long run.

I love hodlers, even if it's small amounts and they forget about it.  :)
@_date: 2016-01-11 02:09:50
Then they create something to bypass you?  
Not arguing for our against what banks are doing, but I wouldn't say investing in blockchain technology is a good thing for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-11 06:31:01
I want one but doesn't look like they will be available in the USA 
@_date: 2016-01-01 07:14:31
I'm excited to see where bitcoin will go this year.  Price/technology wise it's always interesting.  Here's hoping for something positive for everyone this year :)
@_date: 2016-03-10 04:52:24
Absolutely nothing wrong with more exposure, even if it is an exchange.  I like options :)
@_date: 2016-01-13 06:48:08
I was hoping for that as well.  This just shows some basic info and the benefits.   
Still better then anything I've ever made though, just my 2 bits.
@_date: 2016-03-31 05:22:31
Why not a hardware wallet?  For that many I'd get a few and split them up for safety.
@_date: 2017-02-12 08:03:33
Mining would be the easiest way at that time.  I'm unsure if any exchange was around. I'm sure something was, but I wasn't part of the space so I couldn't tell you.
@_date: 2017-02-01 04:12:13
What happened?
@_date: 2016-01-07 08:17:20
That's called bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-06 05:41:27
While it will take some time, email support.  They should be able to assist you further.

@_date: 2017-03-03 15:27:02
Just bought less Bitcoin.  I do a weekly buy and it's less and less every week because the price keeps going up.  We need to reverse this trend, you guys don't understand the consequences!  /s
@_date: 2016-01-14 07:16:02
I'd place a buy order on an exchange for ~10,000 coins @ a set price (maybe 450 or so) just to see the art of the bull whale and of course Reddit exploding about it.   But I'd rather gamble with bitcoin then with powerball tickets.
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:32:52
Variance though. Isn't the last 1000 blocks a better indicator?
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:52:50

Welcome to bitcoin. Enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2016-06-07 05:56:54
Price skyrockets, but don't worry it's bad for bitcoin. 
Hint: nothing is good for bitcoin apparently.
@_date: 2016-06-03 15:53:37
Please be right.
@_date: 2016-06-25 18:02:12
Trezor is the go to hardware wallet, however it comes with a price tag because of this.  If you have a decent account of coins I would highly suggest it.
@_date: 2016-06-13 18:37:11
Exactly what I was thinking
@_date: 2016-06-20 08:42:18
Better then what I say most of the time.
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:04:06
My man!
@_date: 2017-01-06 01:30:17
I came for the upvotes
@_date: 2017-01-04 06:15:29
Very much this.  Unless your using a throw away account I wouldn't give any details.
@_date: 2016-06-12 16:11:53
Reasonable request, I'm on it.
@_date: 2017-01-13 04:15:16
You need to start somewhere :)
Plus it won't hurt as bad if the price drops like crazy.  But it also won't feel as good if we start going up again. 
Either way welcome to the party :)
@_date: 2016-06-14 14:22:53
Send all bitcoin to me.  You are now cured.  
If you keep buying repeat my treatment and the issue will stop eventually.
@_date: 2017-01-30 04:58:20
Buy at all times.  Seems to work out for me so far.
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:29:07
I had this thought too.
What if he dumped both? 
@_date: 2016-06-08 06:10:14
Oh that's why the price increased.
@_date: 2017-01-26 01:46:47
I would highly suggest them.  Great product and wonderful company.
@_date: 2017-01-13 23:00:08
It's possible they do.  I believe that's what it looks like when you deposited directly into GDAX
@_date: 2016-06-30 09:48:16
Very cool, I wish you luck in your venture!
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:44:39
This is actually my first stuck transaction, luckily it's not very significant.  
It certainly does make me wish we had a scaling solution in effect at the moment.
@_date: 2016-06-03 05:43:08
This.  0 fees as well if you use limit orders (that are not executed immediately)
@_date: 2016-06-27 08:30:54
And bitcoin keeps doing its thing.  
@_date: 2016-06-21 10:44:27
Future man get out of here.
@_date: 2017-01-24 07:31:44
So someone will mine all the posts and they will go away?  Neat
@_date: 2017-01-18 04:30:05
I don't know why anyone who is planning on selling and then buying back wouldn't use a exchange.  But maybe people are considering GDAX as coinbase as well.  Uncertain, though I find exchanges are much better to use in general.  Coinbase is just a easy on ramp which charges a large fee for the convenience.
@_date: 2017-01-24 16:54:47
Try waiting 21 hours.  It's hell I tell you!
Seriously though, this is about one upping people right?  Someone must be waiting 22 hours by now?

Bitsquare is a great idea, but currently not enough people using it.  I'd suggest exchanges like Gemini or. GDAX but you'll have to wait on ACH transfers such can be annoying.  Also KYC and AML headaches.
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:26:48
@_date: 2017-01-19 16:27:18
But the people are the ones who like the wrong ideas.  We have to hate them.
@_date: 2017-01-03 19:27:24
I also like to think of myself as a nut, pressed against the warm squirrel like fur of Bitcoin as it holds me.
Glad to see I'm not weird for thinking this.
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:47:07
I've heard this before. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 17:54:07
I'll believe it when I see it.  It would be cool to see though.
@_date: 2017-01-24 16:53:17
It seems your text book has caught "The Bitcoin". Best to return it and get another one. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 05:15:05

Kialara coins are amazing, and the maker of them is a joy to communicate with.  I can not talk highly enough about the quality of the product, and the person that makes it.  Always looking forward to the next piece of work Max does.

My friends are not interested. Of course I hardly talk about it.  I don't want to force them into it, but if they have any interest or questions I'm happy to talk.

It's a start, but you are correct.  It is really hard to prove a negative.  If I think of anything I'll let you know.

There will be loop holes. Other exchanges will take customers who want leverage.  But this may help at least.

Seems no one answered your question. 
Those are hardware Wallets. The benefit is they hold your private key, keeping it off your computer and therefore almost impossible to figure out.  The main attack vector for hardware Wallets seems to be malware replacing Bitcoin address with imposter addresses.  But I know trezor has a function that allows you to check the device to confirm any address you generate. 
They are expensive, but worth the cost in the long run.

Bitcointalk has a forum that sells all sorts of coins, I'd suggest looking there as well as eBay if your in the market for Cass coins.

Mining is more of a hobby now, I do not believe you can mine for a profit unless your somewhere where power is free.  The area is too saturated with mining farms currently.
@_date: 2016-12-12 06:00:21
Correct.  The seed can be used to gain access to the funds again, you'd have to use a software Wallet to do so.  Any BIP39 enabled wallet would work (most have that enabled these days)
@_date: 2016-11-04 02:36:28

What worries me is the amount of time needed to identify the issue, write the code, test and then deploy.  Wouldn't it be better safer to tackle the issue now instead of after QC becomes a reality?

@_date: 2016-12-30 07:37:34
They don't, however if you are a market maker (you provide liquidity by placing limit buy orders on the exchange). You pay 0 fees.
Most exchanges reward makers with lower fees / no fees.  Could save you some money and get you extra coin that would have been for fees. 
It's up to you if the convenience of automatic buys is worth the fee you pay.
@_date: 2016-12-24 16:12:24
Thank you!

Bitcoin can do a lot of things.    
@_date: 2016-12-19 03:44:36
Uncertain honestly.  It makes sense though, no need to waste time transferring from coinbase.

Impossible to get an exact number.  Though I wish we could. Would be interesting to know.

I sadly never got the chance to buy at that point.  I'm the first of my friends / family to actually take an interest.
I wish I had someone else in my life that was interested earlier on, but it's easy to say that knowing where bitcoin will be today.

I didn't realize we were having a fair :D
@_date: 2016-12-05 11:44:11
This is the best advice.  Bitcoin is in no way a sure thing, however there is a lot of potential, something new and better could possibly replace it in the future.  Or it could be made illegal in a few countries.  This wouldn't kill bitcoin of course, but it would certainly take a hit value wise.
@_date: 2016-12-12 05:50:43
Hardware Wallets generally create a seed that you write down in case of failure.
Paper Wallets work too.   Both situations require you to have a safe location, or locations if you make many paper Wallets 
@_date: 2016-12-12 06:03:35
ACH deposits should be free on coinbase.
Also if your looking for no fees, GDAX (coinbase's exchange) offers no fees for market makers.  However that may be too cumbersome for some.

You may want to hold on a few days. Black Friday normally comes with a trezor deal ( buy 2 for x off is their normal deal).  It may be better this year and your know in a few dates.  Ledger may do something as well so keep an eye out.

What your describing is called mining, a process that secures the Bitcoin Network.  Sadly at this point you need specialized equipment to mine.  You'd also need a fairly free source of power to stay competitive with all the other miners.
Do don't mine, unless you feel like doing it for fun, you'll most likely lose money, it's far from free.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:53:41
By sending your private key you give them access to all the Bitcoins that private key controls. 
So unless you sent that to the most benevolent pool, your coins would most likely no longer be under your control.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:51:29

Lots of resources on YouTube to watch if your interested in learning.  Mining took me a while to understand, the whole process is interesting and it's really neat when you send your first transaction.

@_date: 2017-11-10 05:40:40
The exchange has better fees, and even no fees for makers, but your order size has to be .01 BTC or higher, otherwise you have to do a market order.  But the fees are much less on the exchange. (GDAX)
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:14:05

I started with stocks however so this was the opposite realization for me OP.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:28:39
Your half right, you added up your old transactions (inputs) and created one bigger transaction (output).  But this didn't make anything faster or slower. Your transaction fee is what controls how fast your transaction gets confirmed.  You may have sent it to the network during a Time when there was a lull in transactions which would cause a faster confirmation time.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:45:05
Thanks for the kind words. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:59:39
I certainly agree with you.  But it's felt like a bubble almost all year.  I'm scared to see it pop but it's extremely interesting to see how high it goes.

Don't buy something you don't understand.  (But please do learn about it and make your own choice)
Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2015-08-07 06:33:10
Any deals for buying 2 or more?
I know you've had the buy 3 for 299 option for a while.  Just curious if something like that will still be in effect.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:23:38
Depending, wallet software tends to do most of the work for you.  So if there are bigger BTC amounts in your wallet those would be used before the smaller ones.  But if you have a lot of small BTC amounts (sometimes called dust) in your wallet and you want to send them all to another address, that would cost extra.
The work around for this is waiting for a lull in New the mem pool and sending a lower fee transaction to a new address you own to consolidate the funds into a new output.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:11:28
If true congrats!

@_date: 2015-08-29 16:32:11
Maybe if you had two copies and then you cut them in half storing them in 4 locations.
Just having one copy and splitting it runs the risk of losing one half and then not having any way to get your coins.  So yes it's harder to get the coins but your exposed to more risk as all you need to do is lose one piece and your out of luck.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:52:12

0.002413 actually, but your point is valid.  There is talk of using smaller value labels to make things easier but I'm sure that's a long way off.
But then again bitcoin is still young, it could just be the backbone of a much bigger system built on top of it.

Holding works.  Bringing it up casually with people, don't be annoying about it, but just mentioning it can get someone interested or maybe push them to look into it a bit more.

My understanding is there is a fingerprint of the last block on the next block, this effectively "chains" them togeather, so any small change to any block from the past would mess the entire blockchain up making it clear someone messed with it.  So what your suggesting would in fact be far more difficult (by large orders of magnitude) then attempting to change the last block.    Please forgive my terminology as I'm sure this could be said better by someone more informed.
@_date: 2016-02-17 21:16:18
They still would have to work all the way to now though.  Unsure how long that would take but I'm sure it's still too much of a task to fake a chain up till now.
@_date: 2016-02-21 03:15:14
Came here to say this.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:08:31
Just us bots.
@_date: 2016-02-22 07:33:27
Amazon has a few physical coins.  I'd suggest those plus a bunch of random QR codes you printed out on paper.
@_date: 2016-02-12 06:43:02
Completely agree with this.  No need to fight like each side is trying to destroy each other.   
@_date: 2016-02-19 07:30:42
Exactly what I thought
@_date: 2017-04-24 03:39:30
Good times
@_date: 2016-02-01 07:10:10
Thanks for the heads up.  
@_date: 2016-02-21 17:49:37
No promises and no assurances on price.  If something better comes along or some vulnerability is discovered then the value could easily drop to 0 or very close to it.
@_date: 2017-04-16 05:52:23
This was posted here a while back, but it's still good :)
@_date: 2017-04-24 03:40:55
Who does that?  Do you often talk about how much you made with bitcoin? It are your "friends" just out to ruin your day when ever they can?
@_date: 2017-04-23 06:17:03
This.  Still neat though
@_date: 2017-04-17 11:04:19
Thank you for taking the time to post this.

And you want it now.
Just call JG Wentworth.
@_date: 2016-09-08 07:19:41
Agreed, I played a bit of the beta and I'm not super impressed either.  Love the concept but wish the gameplay was more fun.

A few people are asking this so he is the answer:
Your looking at a physical Kialara bitcoin bar.  These bars were made by Max Mellenbruch ( wonderful person to work with and communicate with). He sells these bars on his website which is located below, you can also see more pictures of them and several different designs.  I would highly suggest grabbing one or getting one as a gift, the quality is fantastic and I personally own a few myself.  
@_date: 2016-09-04 17:14:54
There have a private key inside them, which you would have to destroy the pod bar to get to.  On the opposite side of the bar (referring to the picture here)  there is a public address printed.  
@_date: 2016-09-15 17:33:51
Not sure this belongs in this sub.
@_date: 2016-09-25 16:22:46
I know bitfinex has this ability, however they recently got hacked so many would steer you away from them.
GDAX also supports bank wires as well.

Looking to sell bitcoins for $700, get them while they are cheap
@_date: 2016-09-28 08:53:13
Not sure I'll ever make it there, but congrats!  I hope bitcoin continues to gain value in the coming years :)

Realized a few people asked so I just posted the reply.  But yes, I'm on mobile.

Hmmm a loyalty program that spans many industries is an interesting idea.  I'm interested in how this will turn out
@_date: 2016-09-03 07:21:28
I recall reading September is when they plan on fully releasing.  But I could be wrong.
@_date: 2016-09-02 15:28:27
I'm wondering the same.  I'm very interested And I like the browser so far, I'm just wanting a working product.
@_date: 2016-09-17 07:54:15
This is really up to you.   I love hardware Wallets and recommend them highly, however you need to figure out when you want one, no one can tell you when.
@_date: 2017-09-26 02:37:42
Is that what you call your rooted Android phone that hasn't been updated in 3 years?   
@_date: 2017-09-19 04:17:12
I also pay women to wear bitcoin themed shirts.
I'm lonely. :(
@_date: 2016-09-25 16:23:59
I would check any fees ahead of time before buying bitcoin from anyone.  
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:26:13
Wish I was still on my road trip, this would have been a fun use of my time.  Good luck op!

Oh well.  Keep doing what your doing!!
@_date: 2015-09-10 02:12:36
Gotta vet not only the OS but also all the programs that run on that OS.
A mistake could cost a company millions.  I'd take my time with upgrading too with all that said.
@_date: 2015-09-12 16:58:11
Thanks for hodling!
Hope it all works out for you, but I would suggest diversifying a bit more.  Still good luck to you!  Hope your moon mansion is gentleman.

@_date: 2015-09-15 13:46:41
Is bitcoin doing what you thought it would?  
Knowing what you know now, would you have made any changes to the original code/white paper?
@_date: 2015-09-07 17:52:24
Does trezor not offer support?  I would be sad to hear this as I'm interested in a hardware wallet solution soon.
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:59:16
I like hearing things like this.  Hope we can continue to use the heat from mining in more and more creative ways.
@_date: 2015-09-06 00:35:15
I own mastering bitcoin, would you suggest any of these as well?  A good book on the basics I could give someone who's interested would be nice.
@_date: 2015-09-13 22:32:11
Wish coinbase would hurry and be available in more states.  I'd love to use their exchange services.
@_date: 2015-09-07 18:21:09
I figured they would have some sort of support.
Sounds like OP needs to contact them.
@_date: 2015-09-26 17:13:36
Gross :(
@_date: 2015-04-18 17:45:09
Is it anything like cookie clicker?
If so then no thank you, I've lost too much time already and I can only click one thing at a time.
@_date: 2015-04-04 08:11:56
Nope nope nope
@_date: 2016-10-24 15:58:39
The problem with reputable accounts on any site is that they can be bought and sold for scammers to get away with that one scam that makes it worth it.  People suck :(
@_date: 2015-09-30 06:39:05
Texas soon please! :)
@_date: 2015-09-04 04:01:01
Wish I was mining in the early days for this reason.  Normally kept my room fairly warm with just my pc running.   Mining on top of that would have helped at night.  (Basement dweller at the time)
@_date: 2016-10-02 05:32:43
I'm wondering this myself.  While I love the idea I fear being scammed.
@_date: 2016-10-16 20:12:35
It's not easily used by the end-user. Simply put it needs to be more simple
@_date: 2015-09-03 05:55:45
Love seeing more hardware wallets.  The more choices puddle have the better it is for the people.
Keep them coming please :)
@_date: 2016-10-25 08:34:08
That's actually really cool.  
Might have to look into buying some in the future.
@_date: 2016-10-24 19:26:08
I used to watch adult swim like crazy, neat to hear they mentioned bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-24 19:24:27
The Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-10-27 17:17:06
At this point it might be foolish. Unless you think bitcoin is going much higher, but even then your paying a large premium when you could just buy bitcoin directly.  
Best wait for a ETF as others have suggested.
@_date: 2016-10-21 15:26:52
I'm hoping side chains are high priority for the devs.  Side chains will add so much more functionality to the whole system.  
@_date: 2016-10-10 21:20:02
OP posted link below:
Unsure if they ship internationally.
@_date: 2015-11-11 10:13:43
There are people who bought at 1k.   However you should believe in the technology, not the price.    If you don't then I can't really suggest bitcoin to you.
@_date: 2015-11-11 10:12:11
I wish I sounded this smart when I talked about bitcoin.  Sadly I fear I still sound like I don't know what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:11:12
Get out of here with your logic.  
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:08:37
You and everyone else.  
Be happy with what you have now and enjoy the ride.  You will gain nothing from speculating on what you could have done in the past.  Just think of those who don't have any bitcoin :(
@_date: 2016-10-08 05:16:40
Only issue is with sites like YouTube where they summer have any way of knowing which content maker deserves the bitcoin.   But I'm still hoping brave catches on.
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:18:26
No one said it yet.  June 21st.
Thanks for doing this!  Always fun seeing things like this
@_date: 2016-10-03 04:32:58
I'm also interested in the answer.   Please share your experience if you stick with them.

Another Tuesday, another bitcoin typing thread.  Much respect to those who take the time to spread the bits.
@_date: 2015-11-28 09:35:15
I tried to make petite aware that .info was shady.  Random account that never posted in any of the bitcoin sub reddits suddenly appears and is starting a black Friday site! Sounds legit.  
Sad that people were tricked :(
@_date: 2016-10-23 08:02:53
I really enjoyed this talk, gave me something to listen to on my car ride today.
@_date: 2017-05-07 03:50:52
Segwit and coinbase listing it as well. Lots of good news for LTC, hoping they keep ticking up. Not sure Bitcoin would get the same % bump but it would certainly jump if we figure out this scaling thing.
@_date: 2015-03-30 18:13:30
When I visited the page on overstock it only showed windows Mac and chrome os.  
Probably a formatting issue or me just not seeing it.
@_date: 2015-11-26 07:50:30
First I heard of this.  I'm sure someone at coinbase might be able to explain.  Then again their social media support staff might be off for the holidays.
@_date: 2015-11-09 17:23:32
Hope things go great this year!
@_date: 2015-03-31 06:59:10

@_date: 2017-05-21 00:44:32
Anyone notice the price these days?
@_date: 2016-05-30 04:45:01
This is my opinion.  Rather we focus on problems that need solving, not questionable business moves.
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:15:49
I would want this as well.  Helpful as I can not be up all night watching bitcoins price and its good to lock in profits.
@_date: 2015-03-09 09:23:16

@_date: 2016-10-29 00:49:53
I didn't notice too much FUD this time around, just some people wondering why their transactions didn't confirm.   Maybe I'm just not paying attention enough.
@_date: 2015-10-23 04:49:18
Bitcoin is worth more then the national Bank of Greece!  Let's celebrate!
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:55:20
Haha, that would certainly cause some more momentum I think.

Hello ^.^
Keep spreading the bitcoin love :)
@_date: 2016-05-14 15:54:58
Only invest what your willing to lose.  Also learn more about what your investing in.  Bitcoin is far more then a finite asset that happens to have a price.  
@_date: 2017-05-15 04:03:39
This is good advice.  Maybe buying 100 weekly till you are happy with your storage method.

I hope the train stops at the moon.  I've been waiting for a while now.  So many delays =\
@_date: 2015-10-28 07:21:40
Supply and demand mostly.
That and speculation, plus some market manipulation and China. Also I heard from this guy that his friend told him bitcoin is going to be worth lots of money so that might be why too.
But if you ask me I think it's because it's Halloween.

Good luck.  Welcome to the club.
@_date: 2016-05-15 00:21:04
Fair point.  Very few things these days have no risk associated with them.  
@_date: 2016-10-13 08:33:28
I would highly suggest watching YouTube reviews of all of them and then deciding from there.
Also keep in mind most hardware Wallets go on sale on black Friday.  Take advantage of it if you can wait that long :)

I wish you luck and I'm hoping along with you.   Hopefully those coins will also pay for their children's college as well :)
@_date: 2017-05-19 04:42:36
Leading price is Bitfinex, which hit that price earlier.
@_date: 2015-03-22 06:58:00
I'm glad OP asked this question.
Spread the awareness :)
@_date: 2016-05-14 16:08:49
Sounds like a good plan then. Good luck to you and hope it works out for you (and everyone else that hodls)

Take your time and understand what your doing before buying. Watch YouTube videos and tutorials.  Make sure you have a safe storage method as well before you buy.
And as always, don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2015-03-29 17:37:20
Because I don't have internet :(
@_date: 2016-05-22 18:36:55
Great company and a great product.   I highly recommend them to all looking for a physical bitcoin solution.
Keep in mind they do not have denominations though, so you'll have to remember how much bitcoin is stored.

@_date: 2015-10-17 05:18:42
I didn't get that one :(
@_date: 2016-05-12 04:18:52

I'm always happy seeing more hardware wallets and Ledger always seems to be innovating.  Not to mention keeping pricing reasonable, I'll be keeping my eye on this product.  
Silly question but will you be shipping to the US?  Or any plans to have a partner set up for US orders, noticed your site is all priced in Euro.
@_date: 2017-05-13 06:18:49
Very possible, time will tell.   I'm excited to see what happens next.
@_date: 2016-07-31 07:01:58
You can also look into Ledger.  While I haven't personally owned one yet, I always hear great things about their hardware wallets.
I'm planning on picking up one in the future, the price point seems great as well, though to be fair both companies have no history of compromise.
@_date: 2016-07-12 02:35:02
I too did this.
@_date: 2016-07-07 17:50:57
I found bitcoin for the befuddled to be a good starting point.  Mastering bitcoin as well was a great read and dives more into the technical side of bitcoin if that's what your after.
@_date: 2016-07-16 09:10:25
I wish you success 
@_date: 2016-07-05 05:15:55
Wait just a moment.  Bitcoin and blockchain technology can be disruptive!?  That's the first time I heard this.
@_date: 2016-07-06 00:49:08
Very nice looking coin, always found the physical coins neat.
@_date: 2016-07-06 06:53:08
Few days ago there were a few reports of a 500 error page for some. Seems unrelated as that problem was solved by resetting the cache.
@_date: 2016-05-01 16:11:12
Well I'm assuming it's a small amount from the way OP is treating the situation (being very understanding) However OP should consider alternative storage solutions if the computer that stores his BTC is shared. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 03:33:14
You ask for the moon sir.

Thanks for the quick response!  I'll be sure to check it out :)

You can count me, so that's at least one.
@_date: 2016-07-23 05:05:19
Not a perfect metric, but still very interesting. I wouldn't mind knowing if there was an alternative.
@_date: 2016-07-11 08:16:24
I would love that function.  I love that I can prefill BTC or USD by clicking either in the UI (thank you for that), however if I put the limit price I wish to buy BTC for, having the option to auto calculate the maximum amount of BTC I can buy with current funds would be nifty.  Saves a step for me and my calculator.  Trivial, but I'd appreciate it :)

So every bitcoin transaction generally has two outputs one is the miners fee and then the other output is wherever you're sending your money to.  If the transaction is never mind and added to the blockchain the fee is never collected so you'd still have the entire amount you started with.
I personally never used bitpay so I can't say how they handle their fees.  However they most likely will pocket the difference and not refund you in the event where their fees are higher than the miners fees.

Furthermore the bid and ask prices can be very far from the last traded price, even more so on exchanges with low volume.

I too think college is stupid when I'm a millionaire.  
Just have really good foresight, duh.

Wallet software uses algorithms to determine what the fee would be.  Due to this there is a minimum amount the fee will be.
The 15-minute window is just to see the transaction in the mempool. After that I believe you get 48 or 72 hour for the transaction to confirm.  You just have to send it before the 15 min is up.

Set you all in about 4 more years.  Until then let's hope these websites start coming back up.

It may never confirm.  That's the risk of using a lower fee.  It may also take hours or days for it to confirm.
If your transaction is important, or has lots of inputs you're going to need to use a large fee to get it mined.  If the transaction isn't important or is just one input you can generally get by using a smaller fee but you might have to wait a little bit longer for it to go through.  
Generally what I do with my transactions it's just use the lowest fee because most of the time I'm not in any Rush.  I happen to use wallet software that doesn't allow me to pick my own fee but if it did I would just go off of its lowest setting and then maybe make it a few bits lower.  But that's me.

This is why you wrote down all those words when you first set up the device.    Also if the device is new you should contact support about a replacement.

Wish so the hardware Wallets would get on it, specifically trezor as they have a huge market share
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:46:17
After a few days the transaction is dropped from the mem pool.  So you'll get there money back it just might be "locked up" for a bit.  You also have the option to use replace by fee, but your wallet has to support it.  I haven't done it either so I don't know much about it.

Due to the ETH fork, some are making the claim they are possibly insolvent and this may be a way to help mitigate that.
I don't think that's the case myself but time will tell.

The easiest way is to use a wallet that allows you to set your own fee.  I'm hoping as we move forward that wallet developers will include this more as a standard for wallets.  
@_date: 2016-07-06 07:59:50
Hardware wallets are a good solution as well. Keep your coins safe.
