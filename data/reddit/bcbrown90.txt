I lost my Dad to a heart attack on January 4th this year. Bitcoin has enabled me to pay my mother's mortgage for the rest of the year so she doesn't have to worry about money in our tough time. It's been rough but Bitcoin has made it slightly easier.

I always tell people to know your audience. If I'm trying to learn something, big words that aren't regularly used are stupid and douchy

Right? Invest = I put my money somewhere and I anticipate it being worth more if I were to exchange the thing back to money.

He just thinks you should be able to do whatever you want because people shouldn't be able to tell you what to do. Or trolling you for fun

Ya I can't get behind this one. I agree, I do like less regulation. I disagree with lying for gain on a massive public level, it should be punished harshly. Trying to say its the person who was lied to fault because they didn't verify everything they say is bullshit.

I see why everyone is downvoting you. Your title is clickbaity and makes it seems as though this is the first time it's ever happen with bitcoin technology. Even if the tweet explains it. Your title is borderline at best.
Not trying to attack you. Have a good day.

Not a single person would have clicked your post if it said "some tiny ass story accepts bitcoin for the first time". You knew what you're doing. 
I still hope you have a good day.
