Oh, interesting. I mean I suppose that's a valid concern.. but if someone knows what those symbols mean in the first place they probably know what the nano wallet holds with or without the sticker, but def a fair point. That said.. she can do custom designs too! She just has crypto-related for demos. Thank you for replies!!!

There's other designs and she can do custom designs too. Besides, this argument is silly. It's usually on your person, in your bag or more likely on your desk at home. If you have a lot, it's probably in your safe. It's not on your keychain or a usb you leave plugged in at the office. I get the point of the argument but If someone's coming in because they know you have bitcoin they probably already know what they're looking for with or without a logo. So... why not spice it up a notch?!?!

They just merged the name change PR this morning... PoW PR is still in conflict. This seems like a dud if you ask me.

If you have Bitcoin in a wallet where you own the keys you will be able to split out the forked version from your keys. Therefore you will have pre and post fork tokens.

The problem isn't with BCH. It's their stance on SegWit2x. They may consider the 'upgrade' as the 'real' Bitcoin. People don't like this, usually the ones with [no2x] tags.

Depends how familiar you are with the ecosystem. The jest: You need to sweep your keys of bitcoin. When/if wallets are available for forks you can then sweep the keys again for those coins. It's a hair bit more complicated than that depending which cornmaze you wind up in. I plan on doing a generic write up on my site here in the next few days prior to Oct 25th BTCGPU fork. Here's a countdown for the segwit2x fork:

You'll have 2x coins. As long as you have the private key, meaning you maintain the coins yourself, you have full access to its future forks. Leaving them on exchanges or crap wallets like coinbase is uncertainty at best.

If you believe in Bitcoin don't look at the USD... keep an eye on the mBtc.. that's usually similar, hashrate wise and in the long term is what really matters.
