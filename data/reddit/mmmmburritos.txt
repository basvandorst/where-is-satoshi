this was the worst part!  it posted on bitfloor yesterday as complete but only showed up in my simple account this morning
you should be all set in the next 24 hours
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:35:33
how long do you normally hold a position?
what would you look for before entering / exiting a bitcoin position?
@_date: 2013-03-29 19:43:33
yeah i know about twitter, something feels wrong about tipping on there.  it's like people are standing around shouting at everyone.  i want to reward people that make my life better - like a great post on hackernews, the perfect appetizer recommendation on yelp, or a pull request on github.  facebook would be interesting in that it could spread awareness of bitcoins but i imagine i'd like tipping anonymously on reddit vs to my network on facebook.
you could flip the model too, require recruiters to tip before they can contact you on linkedin...
just so many possibilities 
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:46:30
i thought they should get to know each other :)

Applied for iafcu account on the 6th, got phone call and fully opened my account today (15th).
Now under review by bitfloor.
@_date: 2013-03-26 21:04:14
haha I feel the same - I just want them to spread the word
@_date: 2013-07-27 05:08:03
wow - money's in the bank
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:47:56
you're still in an amazing position! how many people under 20 (well of any age really) can say they've sold bitcoins for a profit?  how many of your peers even appreciate bitcoins at all?
remember you can NEVER optimize the situation when investing in bitcoins - there will always have been a better price to buy or sell.  you're investing in the potential you see in bitcoin and have to accept the volatility that comes with it.
so why not try again?  take the money that you can afford to lose AND dont need access to for the next couple months and buy some at 140.  At the end of the summer you'll look back and either think "damn 140 was cheap!" or "whoops! I lost XX% of an investment I made in bitcoins, oh well, I knew upfront that that was a risk and I learned a ton along the way".  The learning part is the most important.  Be sure to monitor how you feel on up days and down days.  Dont let bitcoins take over your life! They're just a really interesting and exciting hobby.
ps - i bet you think 140 looks cheap  a lot sooner than the end of the summer

ps cool kids table is full - no more beggers

They responded and it was resolved (no more than half a day total).  It was an issue of going from dwolla to mtgox, so I sent them the confirmation number from dwolla and the details of the bitinstant transfer.  I'm sure it helped that I had the dwolla info.  Hope you get your issue resolved quickly! I know how frustrating it can be.

sounds great!

oh man I would love to give on kickstarter!
bitcoins could also be used in all the new crowd-funding sites like wefunder.com
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:44:03
the monday withdrawal was just a small amount to test that all would go smoothly - I just submitted a withdrawal for the rest, will post when that goes through.
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:00:50
i love this. it'd be great if there were a couple of different proposed campaigns/concepts that we could vote on with our coins.  all you would need is a different address tied to each. once they fill up, they get run.
you could have a meta-campaign on top for the non-profit by displaying an address on the billboards or other promo materials
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:25:22
wow there might be nothing i want more than a burrito tube to my house that runs on bitcoins!

i have you tagged, be sure to amuse me next week ;)

another vote for blockchain.info for storing your coins - although bitfloor is a little more expensive it seems to be the quickest/easiest way to buy bitcoins
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:49:57
and i'm hoping my comments draw less attention...
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:48:40
i got my money (bitcoins) on bitfloor during the mt gox "cool off" and sold on the way down 175-120-100
ach to simple account
i hate BofA!
@_date: 2013-07-06 23:12:22
So happy!
THANK YOU SO MUCH audenx &amp; Jordan Modell / IAFCU!
@_date: 2013-03-27 06:18:22
you could wait for it to pull back off of 90-100 like it did from 75 (march 22-24) but there is no guarantee that it will or how far it will move.  If you agree will most of the posters here that it will move higher over time then you should just jump on and enjoy the ride with us :)

I was having  issues with transfers and emailed support  They usually got back to me pretty quickly (1-3 hours).

it seems that one of the things a lot of redditors struggle with is the psychology of trading / investing, especially with the combination of first time investors in a very volatile market. besides the common "don't invest more than you can afford to lose", any words of wisdom?
@_date: 2013-04-07 15:38:38
I don't think that's true: 
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:30:37
yes! so interesting to see their perceptions now knowing how it played out.

mpesa is so cool!  it's done amazingly well and rates of adoption have been really impressive.  quote from 2010 (it was launched in 2007)

great video that complements your point well, I love how they talk about the technology not knowing how ubiquitous it would become.

i haven't been able to properly put in to words why i like bitcointip so much.  it's just such a cool dynamic that i can say "hey take this" without permission or expectation by the receiving party.  i want to do this so bad on other sites (and it's such a great mechanism for spreading awareness of bitcoins)

i probably should look into creating a bitcointippers anonymous subreddit...
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:12:42
yeah i'm still in limbo too - got approved but the deposit hasn't gone through.  I think (hope) they're in the process of opening up another bank account
