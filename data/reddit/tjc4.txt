OP, you are spreading misinformation.
If there were a 138,000 tx backlog, segwit blocks could hold up to 8,000 tx (doubtful but let's go with it) and transactions were 100% segwit, then the backlog WOULD NOT disappear instantly.  
138 / 8 = 17.25 blocks.  17.25 blocks is not instant.
And that assume there are no new tx entering the mempool.  
New tx constantly entering the mempool so it would take longer.
Also if there wasn't such a large backlog and high fees people would transact more (I know I avoid BTC tx because of the backlog) so you assume the lower cost does not increase demand.  
But lower prices increase demand.  This is economics 101 (and common sense).   
Please stop posting this rubbish.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:53:12
3 hrs also assumes 8000 tx (false) and no new tx added (also false). 3 hours is therefore false. This thread is fake news.
If I'm a dick for pointing out falsehoods then I'm fine with being a dick.

It would be just as incorrect if written today.
Cool tactic: when someone points out your post is a load of lies you claim they're "triggered"
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:52:10
8000 is also fake. So is no more tx being added to mempool. So is the unchanging demand. Basically your whole thesis is fake.

You're emotional / upset / butt hurt.  And, sorry, but your analogy isn't apt.  
Good night, bro.  Sweet dreams.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:52:45
I'm not upset. I don't get emotional about this stuff. By your own admission you do. 
Try keeping your emotions out of your investment decisions and you'll think more clearly.  
You might even realize it's silly to complain about four months notice when by your own admission 24 hours would have been sufficient.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:26:40
You say you (1) knew for months Coinbase was going to launch BCH support sometime now-ish and (2) knew it would cause BCH price to go up.
If so, you should have bought some BCH in anticipation.  You have only yourself to blame for not doing so.
Stop blaming Coinbase.  Take responsibility for your own investment decisions.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:26:50

No. No one can explain this because it wasn't chosen because one is ideal. 1mb blocks were implemented as a temporary measure without any thought to the optimal size and it's been that way ever since.

On August 3rd, they announced they'd "have support for bitcoin cash by January 1, 2018" and that's exactly what they did.
They gave several months notice.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:36:07
Bro, you would have been butt hurt and mad at coinbase no matter what they did with BCH.  
You have no evidence that there was any market manipulation.  
Price could have risen:
* in anticipation of BCH being added to coinbase around Jan 1
* in response to ridiculous BTC fees
* because crypto prices are volatile and rising
Your accusation is pure speculation.
And you'll miss Coinbase more than Coinbase will miss you (they won't miss you).
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:18:21
It's hyperbole (8000) on top of hyperbole (instant) on top of false assumptions (no more x added, no increase in demand). It all adds up to a big lie.
And if people did understand the topic, there would be no need for discussion / education.
This is aimed at people who don't understand and, whether intentional or not, OP is using their lack of crypto understanding to mislead them.

This is an over-generalization.  
Forks aren't necessarily profitable.  Forks will only be profitable when they create value by solving a problem.  
There was / is a problem with BTC for many use cases (e.g. small payments).  
BCC presents a potential solution to this problem.  As such it has created value.  
Forks that don't solve a problem / create value will not be profitable.

You're changing the argument.  Just because you can't send anything and everything via Gmail does not mean that it's not a delivery service.  You cannot send many things via USPS (e.g. lithium ion batteries, perfume, fireworks) but that doesn't mean it's not a delivery service.
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:15:50
Enlighten me...
@_date: 2016-12-30 14:50:06
I'd argue Gmail is the most widely used delivery service
@_date: 2016-12-30 19:44:17
I never said there weren't differences.  I simply said Gmail is a more widely used delivery service.  For every one delivery I get from USPS I probably get 30 (and that's being conservative) from Gmail.  I feel most people have similar stats.  Thus I stand by my assertion that Gmail is the most widely used delivery service.

The last few months of hash rate activity have shown that some miners take a long term view of profitability and thus short term price levels don't matter much.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:48:54
Or they could just use that equipment to mine the other chain
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:54:42
Miners were kinda tricked. Only kinda because they knew this was a possibility and created that other chain we don't mention on r/Bitcoin. 
They'll mine one of the two chains because they have specialized equipment that isn't great for doing other stuff.
Which do you think they'll mine?
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:15:54
Stop being silly. Market prices are changing all the time. Yet you act like the market prices are fixed and don't change. 
If all the mining capacity switched chains, prices would change.

How did you arrive at your 1/10th calculation?
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:15:13
Ok, last post.  You say things like "hurt" which are impossible to respond to because you cannot measure hurt in any objective manner.  
Economists cannot and do not measure hurt.  
Economists measure objective things like purchasing power (inflation is directly related to purchasing power - it's what inflation measures).
And, with purchasing power, it can be easily proven that inflation is a bigger tax on the wealthy.  
Two people: 
A has $100 today.
B has $1000 today.  
Inflation: 6%
In one year:
A can purchase $94.34 of goods.
B can purchase $943.40 of goods.
Inflation tax paid:
A $5.66
B $56.60
B, the wealthier person, paid a much higher inflation tax.
And you cannot beat inflation with investments.  
Invest $100 today.  Get 10% "nominal" returns.  In one year you have $110 in nominal terms.  But that future $110 doesn't buy you $110 worth of goods at today's price levels because your returns have been eroded by inflation.  Your "real" returns are your nominal returns after they have been adjusted for inflation.  
The difference between real and nominal returns is one of the most fundamental and important concepts of economics and finance.

Inflation can be thought of as a tax on wealth.

I don't claim to have all the answers - that's why I'm asking questions - so maybe I misunderstand.
But it seems to me you're changing the topic.
Discussion was about cost of operating a node.
I asked about cost of running a node compared to cost of operating LN payment channel. 
You then replied with what seems to be a comparison of the cost of a lightning transaction to an on chain transaction. 
Transaction costs and node / payment channel operating costs are totally different things.
And it would seem cost of a lightning network should be lower because it requires the user to trust the payment channel operator.
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:05:34
If the block size stays the same, isn't the scaling plan off chain scaling with things like lightning network?
Wouldn't running a lightning network payment channel (1) be ridiculously expensive and not a viable option for the everyday user and (2) result in centralization on big payment channels?
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:13:39


Yes, this is what I meant.  Thanks for clarifying.  The reason I posted questions is because I acknowledge I'm still learning. 


This is true in theory, but in practice if payment channels didn't remain open then there would be 3x the work.  To complete a transaction I must (1) open channel, (2) send tx, (3) close channel.
So in practice one must leave some BTC on an open channel for LN to be effective.  This requires trust in the hub.  There is a hidden cost associated with trusting your BTC to someone else.


In theory, running a hub should be cheap.  I expect as you suggest technical cost will be low.  But in practice, there is more than the technical cost.  
Are you going to trust your valuable BTC to an unknown hub provider.  Providers will need to establish trust - this is expensive in a competitive marketplace.  
And hubs will need to have customer support.  Even if a LN hub provider does nothing wrong they will have to field questions from confused users.  Don't underestimate how stupid the average person is.  Whereas with BTC there is no one to complain to if you are a merchant providing LN hub to facilitate the transaction of your goods and services then frustrated users can trash your core business if you do not provide support for your payments.  Or maybe running a hub is your core business.  Either way you will need marketing and customer support.
