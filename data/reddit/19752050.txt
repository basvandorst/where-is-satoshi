I’ve discovered that most people who talk about Bitcoin and crypto understand nothing about “value” and “fundamentals”. It’s almost like a bunch of blind morons following a handful of rich pump-and-dump cheats.

I was going to say that you haven’t answered my question: What is bitcoin worth? But it’s self-evident you’re talking out of your ass. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:18:58


So you haven’t a clue then. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:11:40


So what’s the proper value of Bitcoin?

Do you know what %s are?

Don’t argue with morons.

For unstable fiat currencies, why wouldn’t the country peg theirs to the USD, which is incredibly stable. I don’t understand why a country would convert to Bitcoin when its volatility is astronomical, and when there are more stable alternatives, including the Euro.

Is this based on anything other than your gut?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:14:06


And what if it goes to $2?

How the hell is this “possible”? You’re telling me that bitcoin billionaires will have more combined wealth in bitcoin than the aggregate GDP of the world?

You forgot the /s
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:27:53
Ok fair enough. But why is bitcoin worth $x? How does one arrive at value x?

Why in the world would banks and payment networks want customers to buy virtual currency?

I hope you lose every day you have. You’re a fraud.

Then maybe you should stop pumping it as though a higher price is guaranteed with time.
