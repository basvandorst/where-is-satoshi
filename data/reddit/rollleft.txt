"a recent media report indicated Bitcoin CPI has 98% deflation."
What a +clever+ way to  describe a 50 fold increase in value.

"Never happened before" Didn't GM offer car loans at 0% for 7 years?  Then in 2009 they filed chapter 11 listing $80 Billion in assets and $170 Billion in debt. Perhaps whats good for GM is good for.....

If it's called Bitcoin, why isn't it denominated in powers of 2? Even the stockmarkets do this:-)

To attend NIU you need either a Top Secret clearance or 3 letter agency sponsor. What a robust test team. This certainly adds to Bitcoins credibility.

$10K is a US FinCen threshold for reporting. The US has recently decided to treat Bitcoin as currency and declare jurisdiction over miners and traders. It is possible your bank tried to send it via a US bank. Hence the hiccup. This is a reporting threshold, it only takes a nervous clerk to associate Mt Gox with Silk Road to say no.   
 Canada likely tries to operate the same. Please tell us which bank denied you.

Gold market = 160,000 Tonnes x 35,264 Ozs x $1,400 =~ 200 Trillion $  
If the Bitcoin economy grows to the size of the Gold  market, would the Bitcoins be worth ~10M$ each?

Bitcoin has the potential of Fiscal Superconductivity. This disruptive influence will incur the wrath of all regimes and establishments founded on fiat currencies. Crooks will flourish among the less informed. The press will have many stories yet to tell.

In the beginning there was an internet without commerce. Then some immigration lawyers invented spam. Then Netscape sold a browser for $40.00 and the wired population grew by 70% each month.
Now:A currency founded in 2009 has appreciated 16% each month or the equivalent of a stock split every every 6 months. The fiscal superconductivity (low overhead transactions) have been demonstrated but the wide spread adoption is still under way. The informed adventurers are getting a great ride. This is as risky as a lottery but at least we know how many tickets are sold.

If you are seeking justice and are too skeptical to report this to the authorities why not share what you know with this audience.
Post the  Philadelphia Craigslisting and contact info. Tell us where and when the transaction occurred, the height, weight, age color of hair, accent, likely level of education. Reddit loves mystery but needs evidence to deliver karma.
