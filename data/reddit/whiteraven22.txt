A little high school [P.O.D.]( nostalgia there...

Out of curiosity, what ticker is that?  So far, I've been using  .

Not a bad option, but my phone is a Fire Phone that uses Amazon Apps.  Unfortunately, since I don't have access to the Big Two app stores (Apple and Google) I'm out of luck.

I just wanted to make sure there wasn't a newfound security issue with them that I wasn't aware of.  Looks like the HW.1 can still be gotten on Am and eB for about $20.  Since my bitcoin amount is still rather miniscule, I'll probably go that route for now.

The universe did not exist before four days ago.  Everything we think we remember is just implanted memories.
Edit: a word.

Cool, thank you!  Out of curiosity, do you know why the HW.1 and non-S Nano were discontinued by Ledger?

That whole chart looks like fodder.  Is that clipart?!

I just wish "HODLING" had been used in the example sentence instead of "HOLDING".  It doesn't make much sense to have an example if it doesn't contain the word that was defined.

This seems to refer to the creation and legitimization of a currency to be used as tender, not the actual use of a currency itself.  They are not making fiat money a tender, because they don't have the jurisdiction to do that.  The federal government did that.
I'm not saying fiat money without a gold or silver standard is a good idea; I just don't think it is unconstitutional in the strictest sense.

Perhaps not, but Nikolaos of Myra, aka Saint Nicholas, actually was.  While surrounded by centuries of agrandisement and myth that is highly debatable, he did factually exist.  Behind every story, there is a [kernel of truth](

Can't speak for altcoins, but [bitcointicker.co]( is very useful for BTC.  You can see different exchanges on it as well.

I went looking to see if the federal powers relating to currency were limited constitutionally and found that they really aren't (not necessarily a good thing):


[Article 1 Section 8](

Thanks!  I didn't even notice until I saw this comment.

This section is about limiting the state governments' powers.  It doesn't have anything to do with the federal government's powers.
