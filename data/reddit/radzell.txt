So you're saying that you're going to intentionally make the internet a target by destroy america ability to influence world markets. We've attacked countries for less. Bitcoin would be either outlaw or the government would hack beyond use. 
Speaking of bitcoin, I'm a computer scientist, and a ML quant. I can tell if you even try to do that I would be able to rob the system blind in a matter of months. The problem wouldn't be machine it would be people. Because a current market only work because it regulated. Lets say something like the flash crash happen to bitcoins and 1/16 of the worth of bitcoin leaves the market at once. Or what happen when a I HF move prices by sending false orders which are reject to the order book moving the price of bitcoin to match his optimum portfolio. The government and NYSE can fix those by just simply putting the money back, bit coin can't.

No one wants a free economy and we need the fed. Anyone who believes in a complete free economy and believes the predators of the world would completely destroy the country has never seen a free african economy.
