I completely agree, it's essentially no fees when it's not a micro payment and I'd be fine with calling it nearly non existent fees but it doesn't have the same ring to it.

Sophie isn't my daughter but we are friends with her family. I'll pass this information along. It's great advice.
 I think the biggest impact on a child at this age is being surrounded by people that care and keep you interested in topics like this. I thank my grandfather for inspiring me to learn about finance and teaching me the relationship between the Fed and the Gov when I was Sophie's age.

Here's her reaction to Mt Gox by it's self.

All good responses. I'm actually going to see him in person this afternoon so I'll give him a gentle nudge. He's been getting a bit swamped with orders. All the feedback is appreciated. Maybe higher quality SD cards are in order.

I also feel like younger people view value differently and it's easier to grasp. She was born after WoW and knows that the USD is just as virtual.

Great to see a summary of how kids are getting in to Bitcoin.

If by being fed information you mean someone sitting there telling her what to say then it's a solid no. 
If you mean she's hearing the same thing that everyone else is from the MSM and it sticks then that's possible. We started Money&amp;Tech so you won't hear the same thing you do everywhere else.
Sophie is probably the smartest kid I've met and does get this stuff.

The space is plenty big, I suppose we're competing in some ways but it's also probable we'll work together. I've had really positive interactions with them in the past.

Ok, I remember that name. I just need a public address from you and I'll send your Bitcoin balance  out. Post it here and write it on your ticket if we want to make an example of how well Bitcoin works when you want a 3rd party to verify the funds have been sent. 
It's funny how every problem we had related to TradeHill was on the fiat currency side and everything Bitcoin functioned perfectly. If we can all just switch to Bitcoin we'll be fine.

No need to apologize, it's an understandable assumption if you make a comment and it doesn't appear after a while.

I'm the guy behind info I've mostly caught up and I'm not sure what your user name is but it might be taken care of now. If it's not please email me again and we'll get it sorted. I've been doing everything by hand and by myself so it's taken me a while.
I've just moved 20k BTC to show that I am still holding substantial funds and didn't lose them when Linode was compromised. We had taken precautions to prevent the loss of coins if something like that happened. 
Feel free to contact me if there are any issues. I'm extremely busy but shutting down smoothly and returning customer funds is my  priority before moving on to a new project.

Essentially the loss we incurred from Dwolla eliminated the capital we needed to pursue licensing and hiring more engineers. Paxum didn't take a cent from us and were great but their banks demanded they stop doing business with Bitcoin from what I've heard. The transition from Paxum was smooth.  I wish Paxum the best of luck and we're currently suing Dwolla.

Cogitase, I've sent 140.453 BTC to the above address. It can be verified within a few minutes here at this link:  
My apologies on taking so long to get this straightened out. I'm the only one working at this point and my  priority is getting everyone's funds back before I move on to the next project. 
Also thank you for doing this publicly and allowing us to give a good example of how easily 3rd parties can verify Bitcoin transactions.

Your comment wasn't moderated out. I'm the only one working at TradeHill now and I've been focusing on other areas and just haven't logged in to approve comments. I'll hop on there later and take care of that. Thanks for reminding me.

I'm here to personally answer any questions that you might have. As you can imagine I'm extremely busy right now but consider this all to be very important. 
It's been a tremendous pleasure to work with the Bitcoin community and I truly believe we're working on something that will better the world. 
Our aim is to get the regulation tackled and then return more solid on the tech and the finance side. We've learned a ton in the last 8 months and it has been a great experience. I've probably aged 10 years from all the stress and my blood pressure has gone higher than my grandfather's but I wouldn't take it all back if I could, just do a few things differently. 
I've known Genjix since before Bitcoin was cool (to the masses) and I'd like to say that his crew has the best intentions. I wish them all the best. TradeHill and myself personally will continue to be part of the Bitcoin community and look forward to working with you in the future.

I've answered everything that came in. Can you confirm with me that responded to yours? I can't tell which it is.

Jered from TradeHill here.
I'll check in to this. We're getting literally hundreds of emails daily and  trying to get through them as fast as possible and still provide quality support. We could have missed it or it could have been filtered to spam. 
The only theft that we've seen is from users that used the same login / password on Mt Gox and TradeHill. When their database was compromised a lot of people were put at risk unfortunately. I'll take a look and see when the coins were moved or if there is some type of error. 
If you want to send me the account name via email at info I'll check in to it now and get you an answer. 
Now that the most recent banking issues are resolved our inbox should get it's much needed rest.

I can't argue with that. It's always full but we dropped the ball on this one and that makes up a lot of the emails. We'll send out a mass email and have the motd / blog post ready ahead of time if we run in to any issues in the future.
@_date: 2013-03-31 18:01:30
Email claim and I'll take a look at it either today or tomorrow. If there is a verifiable balance I'll get it out to you. 
@_date: 2013-03-31 18:06:12
Correct but it's deeper than that. The idea is that Bitcoin is decentralized and by concentrating all of the exchange in one place you're creating a single point of failure.  If an exchange goes down for another reason such as a hack or other technical problem you'll be glad there are others to pick up the slack. Regarding liquidity I think you're going to see more exchanges syndicating orderbooks and exchanging credit among each other.

Glad we got it taken care of and thanks for editing your comment. -Jered

I replied to your most recent email. Let's see if we can figure this out.
