Is this scrabble though? It looks like the shitty knock off version called words with friends. That game lets in tons of made up words and abbreviations.

It's $9 fucking dollars guys. How cheap do you have to be to not support the service they provide at that price?

That's fine, if you don't need it, then you don't need to steal it. That was my entire point though. If you use Netflix, pay for it and support the service they provide. I personally want a company like them to succeed and feel that their price point, they offer a fantastic, legal, service. I don't really think it's fair to compare them to usenet+sickbeard, which for the record, I've used as well, where the legality is questionable at best.

Yet they have internet access to use Netflix? Give me a break. If you can't afford $9 dollars a month, you can't afford everything that comes along with Netflix and you most certainly have to have someone in your life capable of paying for utilities.

Russia wants to make sure all of the money laundering and illegal activities flows through the chain of command. What a joke.

CNN is just as biased as the rest. Some are just more subtle, but if you track the parent company's or owner's interests, you can see the agenda like a slap in the face. 
The only way I've attempts to combat this is by reading / listening to both sides of the argument. There are generally valid points in both camps, if you can filter out the noise.

There's no quicker way for people to not take you seriously than bringing up cannabis. Politicians are mainly going shy away from anything that makes guns more obtainable. Avoid polarizing topics and find subjects that can be seen positively from both sides.

My mother in law sent me this a few days ago. She sent another one a few months back too. At least public awareness is continuing to grow.

If someone redirects you to a site that looks like the intended one, but isn't, the mock site won't know your image and you should know not to enter your password. It's meant to identify the website as legitimate or not.

I wouldn't exactly say the nation's deficit is a direct result of corporations. All you have to mention is corruption and waste. The feds employs more than all of the fortune 500 companies combined now. It's a massive conglomerate essential that encourages increasing budgets and discourages under spending.

They put up a fucking divider while chanting for someone not to divide them, then forcibly removed someone from expressing an opinion. How more hypocritical do people have to be before you stop worrying about being disrespectful to a mindless chanting cult of stupidity?

My buddy is the photog that took this years ago. There's an entire series of them.
Edit: For anyone interested here is more work by [Neil](  Here is another of my favorites

It was years ago, but I think he rented the suit. With him though, who knows. I wouldn't be surprised to see him just walking down the street one day in it.

I have a family member high up in the state department who, under the Obama administration, was tasked with writing up a position on bitcoin. Utimately they plan on heavily regulating it one way or the other. It was way off their priority list though for now.

You're missing the point. Yes it is their right to kick people out, but it's completely hypocritical to do so. Make the analogy of the US being private property and it should be blatantly obvious how asinine their behavior is in comparison to their message.

Hate to break it to you, but this is already common practice around here. QE1,2, and 3 all within Obama's reign. It's a problem, but one no one bothered to give a shit about for nearly a decade. What Trump said is technically what this nation already does.

Also, we tend to accurately report how many are imprisoned. Believing Russia and China do the same is basically admitting to not knowing anything about those two Nations or their history.

Got one for my wife for Xmas. After owning iPhones for years myself and playing with her Samsung Galaxy 3, I can say I'm a bit jealous. Windows phone is a breath of fresh air to me. Has the apps she needs too. The pictures are why you get that phone though since they are amazing. 1520 is a bit top heavy because of the lens, just keep that in mind. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 00:01:39
Just realized I was actually talking about the 1020, which I think also doesn't come in blue. Got the flu, seriously out of it apparently. Nice phones though!

The problem / difference is the leaders of the nations where drone strikes are executed are allowing them to continue, in almost all cases.
