If only GDAX transfers didnt take so damn long.... 
By the time funds are available it might be at 5k, I should just make a weekly auto transfer and buy like fiat investments.

Wait people had problems getting verified? 
.... researches a little bit, sleeps on it, decides to get involved.
... Little more research and commit to decision.
.... reads instructions, follows instructions, remains patient....
... is verified without issues.... transfers in, transfers out, increases amounts and repeats, occasionally buys, occasionally sells, day trades a bit, gets bored, hodls....
.... ???
.... profit...
I dont understand what the big deal is

And nobody knows how much he is hauling, could be .00001 BTC or could be 50.0 BTC, sure would be a waste of fuel for the former.

Agreed... I dont take large risks. Im financially sound (Ok I take that back, having a CC balance goes against what I believe is financial stability) but the risks I do take are always business ventures after I do my research. So far Ive had 1 failure (lack of time) and 1 that looks to be successful and will turn into something, but I still keep my day job as I cannot jeopardize my lifestyle if things dont work out. While others take big risks for big rewards, I take small risks for small rewards. 
Doesnt stop myself from hindsight saying "shoulda followed my gut and took the risk." Its normally that and rarely "good thing you didnt"

Yes but be smart about it.... My bitcoin trading and/or appreciation profits pay for the interest on my mortgage. If I increased my total bitcoin and didnt pull out it would also cover the interest on my CCs and Heloc.

Im known to do that.... It would be worse if I actually sold something in order to buy bitcoin, or use my salary to buy bitcoin, but up until this point I have only used side/odd job income to buy bitcoin. 
Did I want to triple my BTC holdings when I received my tax refund? Yes... Did I? No.... To me BTC is something I had zero invested in and I make (save) more money by holding BTC than if I just paid the 7.9% CC....
My only poor investment choice was buying a few video cards (then again I am thoroughly enjoying gaming now that I am not using a GTX 560, I didnt know what I was missing so it wasnt too bad of an investment)
