Still trying to get familiar with everything, I talked about planning to buy up to 150 bucks of coins/bitcoin prolly in yesterdays thread. Thanks to everyone who replied!
There's a catch and I need advice. I'd like to buy at a dip (doesn't particularly matter if at the current one or later) and take back out the 150 bucks when it hits a high. Mainly because we need at least a tiny emergency fund for the upcoming 2 months (im in europe btw). Depending on how we solve our current situation im either going to keep and hodl what was made from the 150 bucks, or also keep and hodl and put some disposable cash into btc. 
How fast can I get the money out? In terms how fast can the transaction go? I do have a credit card.
Also, if anyone would recommend a particular service that is worldwide/open to eu/etc, would be great. I've been looking at the list generated by the website from sidebar or faq and so far i havent really picked anything. Been favoring Kraken, kinda.

I think i phrased that wrong maybe. I'm thinking of toying with altcoins and try to invest in bitcoin through them. Or to be able to pull in bigger investments maybe. Or are we past the point where i.e. mining altcoin is viable?
I need a lot to catch up on, ugh

I know everyone probably want to know that, but if what is the best course of action right now if I want to get in and have very limited funds to work with (think 5 to 150$)? I'm sort off thinking about toying with altcoins maybe? 
I'm already educating myself further and I do know a tiny little bit about the whole thing, since it caught my interest  in 2013. Always believed in it, but was so bad about keeping tabs on it :/

I'd rather not flood the subreddit with this question, so I'm asking it here, sorry if it's the wrong place. 
Wasn't there a bitcoin wallet given away by reddit years ago? Not sure on the terminology, I was unable to find it through googling and I haven't followed bitcoin since then (so for 3-4 years I guess?).

Wasn't talking about a physical one. Still thinking about it a bit, but i found the reddit tipping thing that it's inactive now. It was either that or maybe a paper wallet (highly unlikely) or maybe the blockchain.info thing? Anyways, haven't found anything in my reddit post history or in my email, so i guess I'll give up on this.

Ah, thanks. Because both words were capitalized, so it sounded like a brandmarked service of something..

Excuse me, could you elaborate on the reasons? 
I'm new to the whole digital currency thing and still wading through the infos.
