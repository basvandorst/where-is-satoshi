Sometimes I wonder how much of this type of shit makes it in to history books. Like how it's a well-accepted fact that WW1 was all started by the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. It's an easy event to point to, but as you dig into it more, you see that both World Wars were caused by a sort of perfect storm of different unrelated events compounding each other.

For someone who has a high school education, has been working in kitchens, and has a child to support, you're doing really well, man. Don't short change yourself - you have clearly been pretty damn smart with your money given your circumstances. There are plenty of people with far more lavish incomes who are still living paycheck to paycheck. A lot of people get a big raise and their lifestyle instantly expands to fill its container. A lot of really rich people buy expensive gaudy shit to make themselves *look* rich when they're still in debt...that's fake success. Though your savings may be small and growing slowly, that is *real* success. Keep it up!

Hal-ven-ing...Half-en-ing...? Somewhere in between those two maybe?
I'm now realizing that this is one of those words I see far more than I have to speak.

If you knew for sure it was going lower and would then go back up, you'd be stupid not to sell and buy back at a lower rate. Then you could HODL even more.
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:56:00


It could, but people were saying that all through 2017 and 2018 too. If it didn't happen then, it'd be really surprising to see it happen this time around.

Don't be so naive, dude. That is marketing pitch. This may have been true when Macs were less mainstream, but these days they make up a lot larger of the market share.

Okay, so even if you perceive an animal to have valued something, that is still you as a human perceiving something as having value.  You believe it has value in the world because you perceive value to another creature.
Thing is, the entire concept of value is a human construct. Sure animals may value things, but they don't know what value is.

Bitcoin might not be the best investment because of volatility, but you could easily get a better rate of return if you invested that money while you continued to make the minimum payments on the car.
@_date: 2019-05-18 02:35:02
You might say nope, but when you have the ability to pay off your car, pay off or buy a house, have some savings, maybe buy a really nice car...at that point you have to balance the benefit of being debt free immediately vs possibly being super-rich years down the road.
Any reasonable individual is going to cash out at the point when they no longer have any debt. If not then, then they would surely cash out when it meant early retirement and never having to work again.
I mean...bitcoin is cool and all, but I'm not going to throw away a life without money problems just for some pipe dream of Bitcoin becoming the world currency and me being the Bitcoin Bill Gates.

\&gt;on the whole it looks like Coinbase is safe, I have just heard horror stories about these coin exchanges loosing bitcoins  
And pretty much all of that bitcoin belonged to people who said "this exchange looks safe"

You misspelled shitcoins, but they have followed so far. Nearly everything is up compared to last month.

You just described a large number of people’s experience with investments in general. Are all investments now a scam because some people suck at managing them?

It costs a certain amount of electricity to mine one bitcoin. That electricity costs money. If the cost of one bitcoin is lower than the cost to mine it, or vise versa, there will probably be a correction.

There's no reason you can't buy it on Coinbase and then protect your investment by storing them in a wallet you own. Nobody is saying Coinbase is a bad buying or selling experience...we're just saying that's all you should use exchanges for.

**DO NOT** buy an Antminer from anyone but Bitmain.
**ESPECIALLY** if the cost seems too good to be true and/or you're paying in crypto without some sort of escrow.
You **will** be scammed, and you have been warned. Sites like that are a dime a dozen. They're all scams and they pop up and disappear in a matter of days/weeks.
Think about it. You either buy miners to mine with them or to resell them at a markup. There is literally no incentive at all to buy a miner and sell it at a loss.

But there's always a chance that bitcoin will go up a higher percentage than the interest on the car loan, so it depends. If the interest on the car loan is low enough, it actually makes more financial sense to invest money in something that will have a higher rate of return. Might not necessarily be bitcoin, of course, but some people are eligible for 1-2% interest on car loans. That is stupid easy to beat with relatively safe investments.

Welp, another price rally is beginning and this looks like the start of noobfest 2019. 
Just try not to panic sell after FOMO causes you to buy at the top.
