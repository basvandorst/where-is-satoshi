Both people involved in that pizza thing are multi-millionaires.
They are both very early adopters.  They never 'sold all their Bitcoin'.
Do people actually think somebody with 10,000 BTC in 2010 isn't rich right now?
@_date: 2019-07-22 01:22:57
and now there are 8 with also a meaningless one with no info.

If you use an encrypted file program, like veracrypt, if you can use a strong and unique password(20+ random characters) and encrypt it in an offline computer you never connect.  Put the files in there.  Then you can record the password in several places and keep copies of the file online. 
Then people need the password you wrote down and the files in your dropbox.  Very hard to get both.  Even then keep the wallet itself encrypted with a password you use commonly.  
This is pretty safe.  You can use the laptop with no online capabilities to snapshot your public addresses to send btc to.

 Most people are wrong.  All investing is technically gambling.   Buying a house included.
@_date: 2019-07-26 16:21:31
Well it says behaviour before or after halving so I can only infer btc does outperform with the halving included.  Which it does and will for 120 years.
@_date: 2019-07-08 22:18:59
Aren't other traders just matching these shorts?  
How are they getting rekt?  Overall it's literally even, minus a few % in fees to the guy running it.
Traders get REKT the same amount on every single short.  Another trader has to take the other side of the bet.  It doesn't even matter which way they bet.
@_date: 2019-07-21 01:11:33


Well no.  You have to trust somebody. 
Here you are trusting the manufacturer of the Trezor or whatever.
This has burned people.  They got secondhand or fake ones that didn't generate random addresses but hacked ones.
Unless you are going to roll dice(literally) and make a public/private key output by manual paper math.  You have to trust somebody.

Yeah definitely.  Open an LLC and do it again, probably be fine.

Coinbase is the biggest and most insured platform.

@_date: 2019-07-07 20:40:32
Well it looks like you lost the BTC due to margin call, and the bug only stopped you from getting around it.
So you didn't directly lose it to a bug.
Also right at the beginning you say the bug caused problems much earlier.  Why would you risk so much after that?  
You just say "the bug" so you are implying it is the exact same one.  The fact that you decided to risk so much knowing that bug could cost you means you took on the risk knowingly.  You will not get anything from suing.  This is the same as somebody falling on a wet floor, if they knew it was wet but risked crossing anyways it's on them.

No.  The idea was to allow you to bank alone without need for a 3rd party's approval.

You may as well just make a paper wallet then with a password you commonly use.
The trezor accomplished nothing for 10-20 year storage.  You cannot rely on it.
Your paper with the seeds is all that matters.  So don't buy the trezor and use a paper wallet for free.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:48:10
BTC will be inflating for another 120 years.
There is no reason to predict what will happen then.  If BTC is the main currency it will be forked to inflate again.  A planned, small, and set inflation is good for the economy.  We will all be long dead.
@_date: 2019-07-22 01:29:20
Sure.  You just also have to mine more blocks than the entire network afterwards to replace their entire chain up to your pre-mined block so yours will be used.  Goodluck it will only cost a few $hundred billion.  Maybe a $trillion idk.

It won't go that high so fast. 
The mining reward would be a ridiculous amount of money. 
It probably won't hit 100k for 2 more halving maybe 3, which is In about 5 years.

No.  Regular folks don't have enough wealth to buy a car.


Many of them are.  Born with a silver spoon is a saying for a reason.  Humans thrive on struggle, this is true for the brain just the same as the body.


They have actual power and ownership of things.  The currency of the time isn't relevant to them.  They also understand risk in investment and you apparently do not.


You barely thought at all.


Most wealth is not in currency.  It's not going to shift much at all.
You are incredibly naive and ignorant.
@_date: 2019-07-08 22:16:11
Yep.  When people assume it's never going under $20K again, FOMO will engage hard.
Probably a few months from now still, as we approach the halving.
@_date: 2019-07-31 15:20:09

That isn't new so how is that 'the gig is up'.
You don't make any sense.
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:18:32
So the platform is, 


What the fuck is a counterparty?  Make an account?  Like on their website?  What?  BTC doesn't have accounts unless you mean sending BTC from your address to theirs, which doesn't make any sense since you say it's non-custodial.


How does that not fail if it's hacked, as you say


So if the platform is hacked then the address you send BTC to is not the right one.  
I mean this might all be a decent idea, sounds very similar to lightning though.  
Way too confusing and needs to be re-written.  Most of this just isn't clear.  Needs an example from start to finish of putting BTC on it, sending it around, then receiving BTC back onto the main chain to be spent without it.
@_date: 2019-07-26 16:17:15
The halving isn't going to stop for the next 120 years so researching btc's behaviour by removing it's behavior during halving is retarded.
This research is meaningless to any crypto that does halv.
@_date: 2019-07-25 21:42:47
Yeah and if you put it in 2 years ago at the path you would have less than half.

DOGE was made out of pure memes.
@_date: 2019-07-10 18:41:16


That can be worked around if we know it's coming.
Just make a new set of addresses like segwit 3's, but with quantum protection.  Everybody could migrate to the better keyset ahead of time.  Any non-address based tech like smart contracts can be cloned directly onto the ledger via fork.  If any crypto is viable you can do the same with BTC.  This is why alts are shitcoins.
To break the tech you need a huge and unanticipated leap.
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:27:04
Well yes, that is why if it's stolen you don't lose money.
This is why we use banks.  If BTC replaces the USD we will still use banks the same.

@_date: 2019-07-22 01:37:27


Then say that point and stop beating around the bush with other nonsense.
It will always be profitable for those with cheap power because less people will mine it.  The cost will go down and they will still make money.  That's how it is now.  That is how it will be without a reward.
We have gone off moore's law.  Computers wont' be advancing anymore so 10-20 year old hardware will mine these.  It will all be about power.

@_date: 2019-07-30 21:56:02

This is why I've repeatedly said not to buy gold on here.  
It will be mined eventually.  It will still be valuable, but like copper or steel are.  Not to the extent it is now.  
I can't wait for gold jewelry and stuff to be super cheap.
Also just to add, gold and other metals are super common off planet.  They are only rare on earth because they fell to the core during formation because of their high densities.

@_date: 2019-07-14 18:25:06
This.  The plan as always is to not sell BTC.  It is to spend it when it's accepted everywhere.  That is where BTC is over $10 million equivalent to today's value of USD.  This won't be for a couple decades.
If you are planning got sell it for USD when it goes up you aren't investing, you are day trading.

Wow you actually don't know we bailed out companies in 2008 and 09?  How do you think they lost so much money on bad mortgages?  You think a mortgage loan isn't an investment or something?
You are incredibly ignorant.  All the company bailouts were because of bad investments.  Even the car companies.  They invested in producing vehicles that then couldn't sell for a profit.
@_date: 2019-07-22 01:20:41

@_date: 2019-03-29 18:11:40
Why are yo comparing a generalization of multiple currencies and a specific crypto?  Seems like you are trying to purposely mislead people.
All fiat is made with inflation for a reason.  That means the value will slowly go down, as intended.
BTC has very little history.  To compare a 2 thousand year old system to a 10 year old system based on how they performed in value is just fucking dumb.

In the context of banks they can.
The banks can use reserve fractional loans with BTC just like they did with gold and do with USD today.
Also there is already a housing bubble, but it's mostly created by lack of construction where people want it.  It doesn't look like anybody in these cities are going to allow low-income housing anytime soon though.  So if they don't it's not going to collapse.

In a single day sure.
That is all you have analysed.
If we are injecting 2%/day and it's steady we assume 2%/day is removed.  That means after the halving they will be losing 1%/day to trade with and in only 100 days there is 0% left to trade.
But sure they won't run out on day 1 like you say. lol

I'm not sure why they do that.
This effectively cuts their gains on the bTC off by a set amount of USD.  They could just sit on the same amount of USD instead of buying BTC.  It would be the same thing.
Like if I buy a $10K short on BTC and 1 BTC It literally doesn't matter where it goes, I have the same amount of money.   Why bother?

And the average work output per worker has gone up 50% in that time due to automation.
So it costs them significantly less to put it on the shelf and sell it.
That is why.
Grocery stores used to have a cashier and a bagger, now you do it all yourself on a scanner that has been in use there for a decade.  They are paying 2 cents an hour for it's power consumption, instead of $40/hour for the workers and their benefits.
Grocery stores in the US are very competitive with low profit margins, 5-8%.  They could not afford to sell it for less and would lose customers if they sell it for more.  They are not giving you some sweet deal with not increasing the price.

Yep.  We know they did too because of the price roller-coaster.

A new form of currency basically always works that way, it's fine.
Most people will have the same wealth before and after they start using it.  
Some will be ahead of the curve in the first 5% to get BTC and a few will hold on like it's an investment to stay in fiat and lose.
We won't see real whales buying in, they don't care.  Their real wealth isn't in currency.  They control real power in companies and dynasties.

u wut mate?
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:46:49
I think this is why we see it spike so ridiculously fast, from 8K to 13K.
Bunch of people flipping trades suddenly realize it's not going down and need to get back in or miss the rocket.
But buying in at 8K now or 12K now, they just cut any flipping profits down to 33% of what they were before if they just held.  
If you've been flipping successfully for a long time maybe you stay up still, maybe not, much easier to just hodl.

@_date: 2019-06-23 17:27:48
I doubt we will see $100K for atleast another 2 years.
$20K mining is too profitable.  
$40K after halving in what like 6 months?
I expect 20K cap now, 40K after halving, 80K 2 years and so on.  It will then get to $1mil in about 10 years.

I think it's day traders realizing they kept the price artificially low and they are all trying to jump back in before they miss the moonshot.  Thus its a bubble, but probably won't crash to 4K, more like 10K.  Then we slowly go to 20K for the halving.

That is not the token, that is software that can be copied with a btc fork.


Not the token same thing again.


Still not the token same thing again.
You don't seem to understand this.  The EOS token is not a company and those programmers are not employees.  You don't invest in the token like a company stock.  All their code can just be copied and forked, then restarted on the BTC ledger which is the oldest and fairest ledger.
Why do people not understand this?  The BTC ledger is better.  It's the biggest and oldest.
Any altcoin that approaches BTC in market-share will be cloned.  
The software copied onto the BTC ledger as a hard fork making a BTC offshoot.  100% guaranteed.  More people will use the new coin because they have it for free from the airdrop.
Any altcoin that uses a BTC like address generation for it's ledger will never approach BTC or surpass it.

@_date: 2019-06-25 17:06:47
Fact is all that tech can be copied onto the BTC ledger.
This is why BTC is worth more.  Any revolutionary tech necessary for crypto success will be copied onto BTC with a hard fork.  Then that will be BTC and the previous alt coin that had the tech first will be worthless again.
For an alt coin to have value over BTC it has to include a truly different key-&gt;public formula that BTC can't simply copy.
@_date: 2019-06-18 16:43:24
We actually need some regulation on the books for this shit.
People will take a fork and call it BTC, it might not be the majority opinion but it is an opinion.
Then they can sell it and claim it is BTC.  Doing it many times to fool people is obvious fraud.  Individual cases though won't be clear.

@_date: 2019-06-26 14:38:47
You need to invest long term.  Stop looking for get rich quick schemes.
You need to plan to hodl for 20 years.  That is how investing works.
If you think a 6 month stint in a stock or crypto is an investment you have a gambling problem.
When dealing with BTC I highly suggest you never sell, only spend when you retire and things are priced in BTC.

The halving itself will effect price by cutting the supply faucet in half.
Knowledge about it is not the same as it actually happening.
For instance, if the price would be $5K if we didn't know it was coming, but is $7K because we do, that doesn't mean it won't go to $10K after the halving still.  $7K is the knowledge priced in, $10K is after the actual halving.  They are not the same.

These guys are selling these shorts to suckers.
Chances are very high they will lose money, maybe fully.
These suckers do not understand the crypto space and are betting against it blind.
BTC halving is coming, this is going above $20K and it's not going back under.  It may soar to $100K and crash to $20K and they will claim it's dead again, but you are never getting it cheaper than the $13.4K it's at now.

This is you telling coinbase to pay somebody from your public address they are holding keys to.  You cannot pay without the c.c. company because you aren't making the transaction.  Just like coinbase you are asking somebody else to do it on your behalf.

There is no reason to know more precisely what % we contribute.  it has long been established that are virtually all of it.  Again try repeating your 4th and 5th grade science classes they could help.

You don't make transactions on a credit card.  You ask the company to pay people for you.  That is telling coinbase to pay somebody, not you paying them.  That is why security liability is on that company and not you.

The developed countries would still use banks with credit cards.

Also the problem is the mining.
You would need to be buying (12.5* 6* 24) $1.8 billion USD worth every day to keep the price going up like that.  It is equivalent to $1.8 billion USD being printed every day.  
The next bull run will start close to the next halfing.

Yes.  They are the biggest with the most to lose.
They are FDIC insured for the USD held there, not BTC, but that is not some shitty secondary insurance like robinhood which doesn't even FDIC their USD funds.
If coinbase steals the coins it doesn't even matter.  BTC price would tank to like $100 again and you can rebuy them.

So I believe bch generates addresses the same way, so same private key -&gt; public address.
The same in that the exact same algorithm is used so the addresses are the same but with different first characters.
Pull your bcash private key and stick it into a real wallet that isn't from a scam site and pray it's still there.
Maybe you can look up your bcash public address with a 1 or 3 in front instead of whatever it has n a block explorer on the btc chain and see it.

Quantum states go to the lowest energy state.
Quantum computers set up the system to the lowest state is a solution to the problem and lets the computer try all solutions at once.  The size of the solution pool is made irrelevant in the calculation time.
You could theoretically solve a public address's corresponding private key this way.
That is the theoretical process that might one day be a threat.  As far as we know that may not be physically possible to set up such a quantum state, but this is like predicting the internet when we invented the radio.
@_date: 2019-01-15 23:31:20
The fork would not be easy though, everybody needs to actively take their coins and move them to a new quantum proof address.  It needs to happen before an attack is made or somebody will segwit the entire ledger into oblivion at once with everybody's signature.

"According to the 2016 Global Wealth Report from Credit Suisse Research Institute, you need $744,400 in household assets. "  This is for top 1%.
" if you have just $2,220 to your name, you’re still richer than half of the world’s citizens."

Alt coins get investors in them to buy up huge chunks of the coins.
This happened to BTC in a way but it was when the market cap was under a million dollars not 100's of billions.

Biance still holds title on those coins.  They are theirs and demands them back.  Just like any other stolen property at a fence they have legal recourse to recover them.  The other exchange must give them back.  There is a clear paper trail so to speak.
This would fall under similar case law to selling an item at a pawn shop.  The cops just show up and take the property back, the pawn shop gets fucked.

The ETF is a huge risk for the government.  
They could very well end up paying out lost money if somebody runs with the BTC and there is a run on the ETF since retirement accounts are backed by the government if somebody steals it just like a bank account with USD in it.

That is such an over the top convoluted way to state the scenario.
Just cutoff one store from the internet, spend BTC there then go spend it elsewhere before the first one reconnects.
Better yet just spend BTC at a store and immediately send it to another address with a higher miner fee, they will probably take the higher fee instead and your funds are still in your accounts.
Congrats you double spent.
Nobody does this.  It's a waste of time and it is fraud. 
You may as well print $100 bills off your printer it's easier.

Just because it's more to move something than it's value does not mean it's lost.
You literally don't understand the meaning of the word lost.
Also there is no reason to believe dust can't be collected for free.  The meme pool clears.  Segwit-like collection can be forked.

Did you write down and copy every one of those tickets you bought in the last 10 minutes when you selected them all randomly?  There would be no point you aren't getting the same numbers anyways.
The chance of hitting the same number more than once with random tickets is too low.  The cost of doing so gives you less tickets because it takes energy and time to record the ones you did.

Bcash is literally counterfeit BTC.  
It already exists.
Also double spending attacks are making counterfeit currency as well.
Just because the types of scams are different doesn't mean BCH isn't a counterfeit BTC.

They called BCH, BTC.

If btc is mostly being used as an investment then it's mostly a pnzi scheme.
If it goes up because of adoption then it's real value has gone up.

Because of the things he says.  here are some of his positions.
Paul opposes laws that require health insurance to cover pre-existing conditions. -Insane.
Paul opposes the federal law that requires physicians to treat all patients who go to emergency rooms. -Insane
Paul proposes sharply reducing the government's regulation of medications and health supplements by reducing the role of, and ultimately eliminating, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -wants to promote health supplements, because he's insane
Paul says that contrary to what most Americans believe, access to health care is not a right, but a good whose value should be determined by the free market -he thinks healthcare can be a free market, like sick people chose to be born sick.
He's a moron.
If he had his way BTC would be dead overnight because he opposes net neutrality.
"He believes the Internet should be free from government regulation and taxation, and is opposed to Internet gambling restrictions and network neutrality legislation."

I recommend this as well.  
Use a secure computer, make encrypted files with good passwords.
Use a password you use all the time if you want and put the files behind a second one you write down in multiple locations.  Nobody can get both.
  
@_date: 2019-05-08 17:27:09
You can rollback BTC.  You just need to make a longer blockchain.  The nodes accept the longest by default.
This would take more than 7000 BTC worth of power and infrastructure to do though as you would need to make a second chain longer than the current one that the entire world is mining.  You would need to start spinning up factories to produce asics, invest billions and probably launch nukes to destroy other mining facilities.

Indeed.  When I see videos covering parts of my field he is actually correct.  It's a rare thing to see and more important than covering every topic.  Also there is plenty of information about BTC on the internet as it's new and came about via the internet.

Hmm weird.  I think doge gets extra security via ltc  mining.  By solving ltc you also solve doge and get a mining doge reward so ltc hash helps secure it.  That sounds like a much better setup as ltc fees are irrelevant, it just needs to be mined.

Hmm you should get coins off  in case they go bankrupt. 
If your coins are stolen off your coinbase account,  that is coinbase's problem.   Same as your credit card being stolen or somebody writing a check under your name.  If coinbase won't give back your account balance sue them.  Subpoena their CEO, developers, and source code because that is their only proof.   Even then you can't tell the difference between as account hack and coinbase embezzling your funds.
@_date: 2019-05-31 14:29:53
It's only USD as the FDIC is federal insurance as in the US federal government.  They are not paying out in some token crypto if coinbase goes under.
If you have USD on coinbase they are actually a bank for you.

The IRS is very underfunded and with the GOP in control they are full retard.
You need to be ignoring at-least $20K in taxes, so $100k+ profit for them to spend the few agents they have that can look into crypto.  
With more than one law a day on the books for the tax code, ignorance is a valid excuse and has been used as a defense.  So even if they catch you, you only pay what you owed anyways.
@_date: 2018-12-16 23:05:36
Those taxes would then apply to anybody renting too, so you still have less to pay because your mortgage is paid off.
You either own your house or you rent one and pay those taxes anyways.
