having seen all the comments i want to say : didn't mean to be invasive i'm more used to the dogecoin thread when people freely say what they have or not have and it s more like a curiosity for me. i know bitcoin became very valuable , maybe i underestimated the way i asked about it. and in no way i wanted to be invasive
 also because most of the reddit users use nicknames

Agree ,bought 640000 doges in 2015 (still have them and they would be worth approximately the same in btc) for 100 € and it was 0.49 btc ....should have bought many btc back then anyway eheh

i saw one in Montreal Canada, extortionally expensive. prefer to buy with credit card with wirex for example. but the idea of buying from ATM is really good but fees are huge and still not worth it

thanks for your input

true, but this is not the monero thread but anyway i underestimated my "invasive" question. it's fun to see the answers after all. these people must own 200-500 btc at least to be so reactive lol

Great Guy. he's so good at explaining bitcoin that even a 6 year old would understand it. he makes bitcoin human, straightforward and real. he 's the real ambassador of bitcoin, an example to follow.

all these ignorant improvised bitcoin connoisseurs will just slow the growth of bitcoin but will not stop its growth. and yes it will be a currency, it is a currency already. in japan you can do groceries with bitcoins lol

its just the start. in 5 years bitcoins and some alt coins will be accepted online everywhere

I dont know if they did it for that reason but if they did this would confirm me that nowadays the usa(i guess thats where you live?) is one of the least free countries on earth....way more freedom in europe. Governments bug you here too but they let you breathe and nobody cares about them. Look at what the IRS is doing these days to americans
