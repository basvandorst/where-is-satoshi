If he has your data, paying him gives you no guarantee that he won't sell it. He could sell people's data who paid him off at a premium over the rest of the users. By paying the fee, you get nothing but an empty promise from a criminal. He may even try to extort you for more money. If you're really paranoid, get a new passport and take other steps to protect yourself. Do not contact or deal with criminals.

There are Android phones and tablets that can be bought for under $50. Why not use an app that provides Trezor-like functionality on one of these Android devices and just disable all radios and never connect it to the Internet? Alternatively, you could use it as an Internet connected wallet. While it would be less safe, it is still pretty secure if you use the device only as a wallet and not for anything else.
@_date: 2014-07-22 21:14:59
Trezor originally cost 1 BTC, about $100 at the time. You could preload these phones, disable the radios and sell them at a markup for people who do not want to bother with it themselves and it would still be more cost effective. Write the software yourself if you want it or fund a bounty if you want others to help. Trezor did crowd funding IIRC. You could save battery life by making it power off after like an hour of non-use, instead of just sleeping. Maybe a custom stripped down Android OS could help improve boot times and battery life even more. The phones aren't that big to begin with and they have a camera and decent screen. I would trust scanning a QR code of the unsigned transaction from my main phone or PC and then scanning a signed transaction QR code from this separate phone more than using a Bluetooth connection that might be exploitable. Perhaps cheap Android smart watches could work too. Some models are already very cheap and you could attach one to a keychain instead of using a wristband. The watches have Bluetooth as they pair with your phone but I would prefer to scan a QR code from their screen to stay completely air gapped.

In that case, where the product is priced in USD and BTC is accepted at a market exchange rate, the refund should be in USD. If I ordered a computer from TigerDirect, where all of the products are priced in USD, any refunds should be given in USD. If I ordered a computer on the Silk Road and it was listed as 1 BTC, I would expect 1 BTC returned to me if I got a refund.

I gave pseudonymity as an example. People like to patronize bars, strip clubs, porn sites, etc. and do not want their credit card statement to show it, especially if their wife reads it. Another problem it solves is in person transactions. You can read about many scammers who paid with PayPal and then went to pick up an item in person, only to reverse the payment afterwards. Bitcoin provides a means of transacting that's even safer than cash as there's no risk of counterfeiting and it gives a timestamped record of the sale.

No I'm not. I said, if it's priced in the local currency then the refund should be in the local currency. If it's priced in USD, the refund should be USD, regardless of what the local currency is. If it's priced in BTC, the refund should be in BTC.

Sure it does but you don't get to decide what transactions you mine or not on a pool. The pool gives you the list of transactions to mine. They are responsible for telling you to mine a transaction that was made in error. They probably feel like it is in their right to undo the effect of that, essentially saying, we didn't want to mine that transaction and we always have control of what transactions are mined or not at our pool anyway.

I understand that concern. Personally, I find the technology more interesting than anything. Bitcoin does not have to be the only one. Litecoin, as an example, can be used easily in any Bitcoin software project because the code is almost the same and the benefits to users don't change. Even looking at Bitcoin by itself, I think Satoshi having 5% isn't all that much of a problem. Yes, he would have a crazy amount of money if Bitcoin was the global currency but he would still have no power to change the rate of inflation or steal people's money. On the other hand, with government currency, a select few people get to decide how much money will be printed this year, what the interest rates will be, etc. I think existing systems are more unfair because someone in a position of power could decide to grow the money supply by 5% this year to serve whatever purpose for themselves or their friends. Satoshi can spend 5% one time only.

They should refund in whatever currency the product was priced in. Many stores around the world accept USD but all goods are priced in the local currency. If you pay in USD and get a refund, the refund will be in the local currency at the amount it was originally priced in. If a product was advertised with a set price in BTC, then the refund should be that amount of BTC.

What problem were they solving that made it worthwhile at the time? People were perfectly happy paying with checks at the time, even at corner stores and such. It was easier to accept, the customer would write out the check themselves and the cashier just checked ID and accepted it. It was quicker than a credit card at the time and everyone had a checkbook. I suppose credit cards made it easier to pay for things you couldn't afford as you don't have to pay off your credit card in full but most people do not carry a balance on their card so I'm not considering that as problem they solved. Bitcoin does indeed solve a problem for merchants that makes it worthwhile. Checks can bounce, credit cards can do chargebacks, but Bitcoin payments are risk-free and final.

You should still encrypt your wallet. You need a way to back it up as your netbook hard drive could die. You also need off-site backups, what if your house floods or catches fire? A good solution might be using deterministic wallet generation and recording the seed. If you only have a small amount of money in Bitcoin (&lt;$10k), I think Coinbase or Blockchain with 2FA is a good place to keep your money. It's not a bad idea to still use that netbook to create your password and access your online wallets.

This is likely one reason why they're not simply scheduling a hard-fork in a few months and increasing it from 1 to 2 or more. They will consider how to best approach the issue, especially if it requires a hard-fork. Gavin has a list of changes that he would like to do in a hard-fork but a lot of work would have to be done to make sure the changes are not controversial and all major clients are updated before the scheduled time. There's even a bug in the transaction script code that causes a stack underflow with multi-sig scripts, requiring a workaround by padding all multi-sig transaction scripts with a leading OP_FALSE since an actual fix would break compatibility.

That's because there is more than one possible solution and all of them face tradeoffs. There are good reasons to oppose dynamic or no block limits. I'm not about to get into the details but feel free to read through some of the discussions. Many mining pools generate blocks much smaller than the existing limit and there are no incentives for them to include more transactions, other than fees. If we reach the block limit, it will cause people to include higher fees to have their transaction confirmed quicker and the higher fees will encourage miners to include as many transactions as possible. The fees will still be far lower than wire transfer and other traditional money transfer service charges. People can avoid the fees by processing transactions off-chain, such as paying a merchant that uses Coinbase with a Coinbase balance. Transactions with higher values are currently prioritized, requiring less or even zero fees to get included in a block. A transaction of little monetary value can take up as much or more space in a block than a high value transaction. It might not be a bad thing to force people making these transactions to pay a higher fee or wait a long time, which will be the case if we do nothing at all. People wanting to make micropayments quickly and cheaply can use an altcoin instead, as the security and reliability of transactions this small is not as important as making sure the Bitcoin network is not spammed and slowed down by such activities. This is only a few ways we could deal with reaching block limits but quite a few other solutions have been proposed.

With the limit, they can only include up to a maximum of 1 MB of transactions. If there was no limit, they could include an arbitrary amount of transactions. A malicious miner could put junk data in their block and provided others build on it, which they would as it's still a valid block, this useless data would forever take up space in the blockchain. They can still do this today but the worst they can do is add 1 MB per block.

Why don't you use direct quotes instead of paraphrasing when everyone can see that those were not the same sentences written? I said it could contribute to Bitcoin becoming a world currency by acting as an intermediary. Governments have relied on gold and more recently USD for transactions between countries. Right now if you want to buy something not priced in your particular currency, either you have to pay your bank, credit card company, or PayPal to exchange it for you. People outside the US deal with this more often. This isn't a problem if we use Bitcoin and have a means to convert BTC to any other currency with little overhead. Most of the options for exchanging one currency for another are only available with minimal fees if you are a large corporation as smaller customers do not get the same exchange rates. Some currencies do not exchange directly with others, without going through USD or another major currency first. Bitcoin can open up commerce for a large part of the world that does not have access to the same resources other countries have and levels the playing field between large and small actors in the economy.

As much as some people would like to blame the user for not having 2FA on their email and getting their passwords compromised, Coinbase is a service meant for the average user and they should be implementing security procedures to prevent this sort of thing. I don't know the whole story because I do not use Coinbase and I obviously have no access to their logs.
I hope Coinbase is spending a considerable amount of resources on security. Here are some thoughts off the top of my head.
* BTC-E implements a waiting period for 2FA reset, does Coinbase do this?
* Does Coinbase offer users an account activity log like Gmail does?
* Does Coinbase look for suspicious logins such as different geographic location of IP address, different browser user agent, etc?
* Along with the above, accounts should be suspended pending manual review if a reset is requested from a location or computer that is different than any the user has used before or is currently using and still logged in with.
* For accounts with a high amount of money, password and 2FA resets should require some form of verification beyond just email, even a telephone call would make things more safe.
* Suspicious transactions should also have fraud prevention mechanisms. Banks flag suspicious transactions from accounts. As Coinbase is acting as your bank, they should implement either waiting periods or additional verifications for unusual transactions such as high value or a large percentage of a balance being transferred from an account with typically low activity.

Not really, you can't get robbed by transaction malleability unless you decide to program your site to send another transaction because the original hash never made it into a block, even though the transaction did make it into a block with a different hash. The official client can send invalid transactions that will never get confirmed if your transaction includes unconfirmed change from the last transaction you sent. This only occurs when trying to send another transaction before your previous one is confirmed and the previous one ends up getting confirmed with a different hash and you did not have enough inputs available in your wallet that had confirmations.


Yes. If you are recording the hash of unconfirmed transactions, remember that they can be confirmed with a different hash. You may decide not to look at a transaction until it has been confirmed, it's up to you. You need to be sure not to credit a transaction unless it has been confirmed. You are generally safe after a single confirmation as the only way to undo it would be to orphan the block and have a double spend or mutated version be included in the longer chain. More confirmations make it less likely, eventually impossible, for the block that contains the transaction to be orphaned.

Good point. Many of Bitcoin's advantages are not important to the average person in the first world. We need to do a better job of using and advertising the ones that are such as pseudonymity. I still think we need friendlier ways of introducing people to Bitcoin. One thing that people often said when introducing new users to computers was, "Don't worry, you can't break it." With Bitcoin it's more like, "Be very careful or you will lose all of your money." With Android devices available for under $100, I think setting people up with dedicated wallet devices might be a good start. With a dedicated device, there is no risk of malware. For backups, we could modify the Android wallet's code to use Electrum deterministic seeds so people can write down a backup of their wallet and put it in a safety deposit box.

You are twisting what I am saying. I gave a computer for an example. If you need/want one, you would buy one that allows you to do your computing tasks comfortably. Would you spend $10k on the absolute best system money can buy? Probably not as it will be obsolete soon and it wouldn't make much of a difference in your life compared to buying something 1/5 of the cost. Does the technology industry "grind to a halt" as a result? Of course not.


Sure, "investing" in literal tons of gold and multiple properties that you never use are desirable characteristics of an economy. Meanwhile people who need the gold to manufacture goods and need the property to live or farm can't afford it.

What does diminishing marginal utility have to do with price speculation? If I was sure the market price of chairs would be so much higher tomorrow, why wouldn't I buy more than I need? This would drive up prices even more, like we see in the housing markets, and make me even more of a profit when I decide to sell.

It's much more than that. If anything, it turns Bitcoin into an intermediary, which isn't a bad thing. While Coinbase may have a US focus, in the future, this could contribute to Bitcoin becoming a world currency. This adds to the idea of Bitcoin being the Linux of currencies. In the same way that a web developer may use a Mac and an end-user may view it using Windows, the pages are actually being deployed to and retrieved from a Linux server. For Bitcoin, an analogy would be a merchant gets paid for his products in USD. A consumer pays for products in EUR, if that's the currency he earns money in.
Bitcoin is used to facilitate the transaction, which means that you do not need to have an account with any specific business in order to use it and accounts from different services are interoperable. The merchant can sell products worldwide with no risk of chargebacks and no additional overhead of converting currencies other than from Bitcoin but international sales do not need to come with additional fees to either the merchant or consumer. To top it all off, in the case of Coinbase, the fees of both parties combined are less than current credit card fees and far less than credit card fees plus exchange fees, which is hardly a giant transaction fee.

By now, it's not news that the US dollar is a volatile asset. Fiat currencies might sound good to the Keynesian economists of the Federal Reserve, but when push comes to shove, regular people want a currency that's backed by gold.
So why in the world would anyone invest money that they will need later in life in the US dollar? For the same reason that people continue to invest in Ponzi schemes, of course. But while Ponzi schemes are illegal - last summer, the Securities and Exchange Commission brought charges against a man who had persuaded people to invest their IRAs in a Ponzi scheme - it's still legal, at least for the moment, for Americans to put their retirement money into something that has only the diciest of futures as a long-term asset.
Legal, yes, but certainly not wise to invest one's retirement money in something that is being investigated by a number of government agencies for its usefulness in drug trafficking and money laundering.
Let the US dollar proponents talk all they want. But if the fiat currency collapses, those who have been foolish enough to pour it into their IRAs will be looking to gold and bitcoin for relief.

Cash but in electronic form? That's a good selling point to me. I do primarily use cash for in person transactions. Bitcoin is more convenient because I don't need to worry about having change, some places won't accept large bills or won't have change on hand, or going to the bank to get more cash.


Someone is paying for that and the costs work their way to you, the consumer. If there's no cash discount, then you might as well use a credit card in these cases.


Yes. ["The most common cause for chargeback is fraudulent transactions."](


I was referring to things like lemon laws. Obviously consumer protection laws won't protect you against fraud as it's already illegal.


How else would I buy it? I have used certified checks but they cost money and I have to visit the bank. Cash is impractical in that amount, some places may not accept that much cash, and you would have to request a withdrawal for a high amount in advance from your bank. With Bitcoin, I could potentially order a new car online, customize it, pay for it in full, and have it delivered to me. One person on BitcoinTalk ordered a Lamborghini from his basement and had it delivered. He never had to leave his house or talk to anyone.


The benefit of foreigners being able to avoid getting gouged on exchange rates seems like reason enough to justify having Bitcoin payments. We have things like traveler's checks for the sole purpose of allowing foreigners to pay without taking on security risks of carrying cash or having to take the exchange rate offered by the merchant if they will even accept foreign currency. Bitcoin seems like a much more secure and universal means of payment for foreigners.
You never mention the ability for people to make payments to each other. How often do you see checks or credit cards accepted at garage sales and such? There's no reason anyone can't accept Bitcoin. It's even safer than cash because it can't be counterfeit. Some people can't get credit cards for a variety of reasons such as if they were the victims of identity theft or have previously declared bankruptcy. People will use Bitcoin if it's convenient for them and merchants will accept it if they want their business. Out of all electronic payment methods, Bitcoin costs the least to accept in terms of fees, requires no contracts, has minimal equipment needed as even a $50 tablet will work, and there's no discrimination where businesses can't accept credit cards because the nature of their business is viewed unfavorably by the credit card oligopoly.

If you're customizing the OS and drivers, there's no reason you can't strip down Bluetooth to match whatever the Trezor functionality is you want. Do you think a Bluetooth Trezor would use custom Bluetooth chips? The only difference is the software. Hardware is expensive to design and manufacture. If you're not making millions of something, it's just not worth it. You would be using the same commodity chips in your own hardware anyway. You can write your own OS if you really don't like Android, similar to using Rockbox or another Linux.

They wouldn't create an open, equal opportunity system if they wanted control. The whole point of Bitcoin is that nobody controls it. The US government already has control of the world's reserve currency and largest military force. Through the NSA, along with anti-terrorism and money laundering laws, they can already look at anyone's accounts and transactions in the US and they are currently expanding their power into looking at off-shore accounts such as Swiss banks. Bitcoin provides far less information to them as addresses are pseudonymous, not tied to real world identities and additional anonymizing measures can be taken. They have far more capabilities with existing systems and they hold exclusive power. Bitcoin's full transparency allows anyone to analyze transactions so they would have no more insight than any government or even individual would have. As for ASICs, I don't think you understand digital hardware design. Intel could indeed make a more powerful ASIC but it would not be orders of magnitude better than existing chips, which are already using cutting-edge chip fabrication. As a company worth almost $200 billion, Intel would have little interest mining Bitcoin when the entire worth of all coins in existence is only about $10 billion.

Mining is random. It's like if you flip a coin 10 times and all flips are heads, there is still a 50/50 chance that the next flip will be heads. Bitcoin mining is similar to this, where every hash is just as likely to be a valid hash as the last one. The problem with trying to solo mine for a full block is that difficulty keeps increasing so the chance of finding a block decreases over time and may decrease so far that the chance of you finding a block is next to nothing. If you mined in a pool, you would get a payout proportional to your hashing power so it allows you to share the payouts from blocks before difficulty increases.

I was not the first in the thread to use chairs for an example but my example is still correct. It might not be average consumers buying up chairs if their prices were skyrocketing but people in the market would. It might be the chair retailers buying more inventory than they would do so otherwise because they would rather stock up now if the prices from their suppliers are expected to rise. This stockpiling in turn causes prices to rise even quicker, similar to speculators buying up land and houses. This is in contrast to something like a market for computers/smartphones/TVs where retailers only buy as much as they think they will sell because they know that better, cheaper models will be available in the future.

How do new people earn less? If there's two people, a man who bought 1 BTC last year and a man who bought 1 BTC last week, they will both earn the same amount of money if the price goes up and they both risk the same amount of money if the price goes down. How is it a pyramid scheme if all participants take the same risk and get the same reward? Someone who bought in a long time ago might have paid a lot less but they take on the same risk by not selling today as someone new takes if they buy today. There are no promises made and everyone is treated equally. If someone decides to "hype" it, all holders of Bitcoin would benefit based on the amount of money they risked, regardless of when they bought in, and they are free to sell or continue to hold.

I was talking about the merchants, not the financial institutions. Yes, for the payment processors, it switches the old actors for a new set but it does a little bit more than that. There is a huge barrier to entry if you wanted to start a credit card company so there are only a handful of players in that industry. If you are a payment processor like Stripe or Square, you must have a relationship with those credit card companies or you will be unable to do business. Not so in the Bitcoin space, where anyone can become a Bitcoin payment processor and no one company or oligopoly can stop you.

There's no reason to have developers that are at odds unless there is something for them to be at odds about. Simply having multiple projects for the sake of it doesn't make sense. It splits efforts and resources, which means that each fork would have less development, review and testing go into it.

In a deflationary economy, people would time their purchases of everything. The best time to buy a computer is only when you need it because you will always get a better one if you wait. The only people researching when to buy are those who already determined that they need one. The same would be true of all goods in a deflationary economy.


No. Money that is not tied to a commodity is not a productive resource. The most precious resources are natural, manufactured, and human capital. Money simply facilitates the allocation of resources. Less money available does not change the amount of useful resources available. Even with Bitcoin, how is the economy hurt if I hoard my share of the Bitcoin ledger? It's quite clear how the economy is hurt if I hoard empty farmland as a speculative investment, instead of it being used to produce goods.


Great, the Fed taxes holders of USD 2% every year, without giving them any representation. It's also the government that determines how inflation is calculated. I can do a good job at anything if I get to determine what constitutes me doing a good job.

For incoming transactions, wait until you get at least one confirmation before reading the hash. You should wait until you get at least a certain number of confirmations before crediting the user but the hash is final after it makes it into a block, unless the block gets orphaned. For outgoing transactions, send them as a batch transaction like mining pools do. This reduces your load on the blockchain and saves you on transaction fees. Queue outgoing transactions and when your last outgoing transaction is placed in a block, send the next batch.

If it switches when the other fork is longer, then the other miners with the 10GB block must also switch if another block is generated on top of the 10KB block as that will be now be the longest chain.

Only [39% of households carry a balance]( so most people are not using them for credit, they use them only as a payment method.


Bitcoin is as consumer antagonistic as cash is. If you're buying things like food and beer, you don't need consumer protection, all you need is fraud protection, which you get because the person taking your card can't copy it or steal your identity when you use Bitcoin. If you're buying more expensive goods, like electronics or cars, you get manufacturer warranties and there are consumer protection laws. Chargebacks are primarily used for fraudulent charges when someone steals or copies your credit card, like with the Target hack, which cannot happen with Bitcoin.


You already stated one benefit to consumers, privacy, but there are others. I don't need to convert currencies if I am buying from a company that expects a different one. It's cheaper to convert EUR to BTC and spend BTC for an item priced in USD through BitPay than it is to buy something in USD with PayPal and have them charge you in EUR. There's no risk for the consumer in the merchant charging more than what was authorized. This happened to me before with a bar inflating the tip from what I wrote in. Sure the credit card company will fix it but after an hour on the phone, they told me to talk directly to the merchant to fix it and I couldn't get a hold of them so I decided my time was worth more than the few bucks I would get back. With Bitcoin, someone gets only what I send them and nothing more. Due to fees and the non-final nature of credit card payments, whenever I have bought a car, the dealer will only take credit card for the deposit and will require me to pay with a certified check, at my expense, for the rest of it. With Bitcoin, I could pay for a car without any additional fees or visiting a bank and some dealerships already allow this.
Is Bitcoin better in all cases? No. Do other payment methods have advantages over Bitcoin in some situations? Yes. Bitcoin is not the answer to everything and it's not perfect but it's disingenuous to assert that it does not have advantages for both consumers and merchants, at least in certain cases. It's for these cases that it will be the preferred choice. It's not perfect and it doesn't have to be. That doesn't mean it's not worth having as an option. If it catches on, it will force credit card companies to become more competitive and offer lower fees. This is good for everyone. We should be in favor of any additional competitors in the payments space. People hate PayPal but it's sometimes the only option. More competition is good.

I don't think this is a good thing. If it was offered as an option when you open your account and you had to agree to it, then it would be a good thing. If I put money away, I don't want anyone to touch or do anything with it unless I explicitly allow them to do so. I get this with Bitcoin, as I alone control my private keys. I don't sign up for overdraft protection or anything else at my bank, even though it's advertised as for my own good. I should at least have the option to have my accounts left alone.

Credit cards were rarely used when merchants first started accepting them but let’s compare the training involved in accepting credit cards when they were new to accepting Bitcoin.
Credit cards: Take the customer’s credit card. Call the credit card company to verify that the card is valid. If the purchase amount is small, you can skip telephone verification and just check the card number against this month’s issue of the book of invalid card numbers. Once you have verified the card number, place the card in your imprint machine with a new sheet of carbon receipt paper on top of it and take an imprint of the card. Write in the date and purchase amount before giving the customer the receipt to sign. Retain the card while the customer signs the receipt and then check the signature with the back of the credit card. If the signatures do not match or the card is not signed, have the customer produce a piece of photo ID and sign both the card, if not signed, and the receipt in front of you. Tear off the copy receipt and give it to the customer. Retain your copy of the receipt or you will not be paid for the purchase because the receipt is the only copy of both the purchase amount and card number of the customer. If the card ends up being cancelled, counterfeit, or the card holder reports it as lost or stolen even after you have verified it, then you are out the money for the sale.
Bitcoin: Open the app for your Bitcoin payment processor. Enter the purchase amount. Show the QR code to the customer for him to send a payment from his wallet. Wait a few seconds for the transaction to be seen on the network. Once the payment is confirmed, there is no risk of losing the money transferred for the sale.

If they can't get him on this, they'll get the IRS after him. Anyone will have at least one law they have broken and they'll find it for a case with this much public attention. It's sad that we call this a free society.

Added? More like replaced the useless middlemen such as credit cards, banks, and PayPal, which incur more fees than Bitcoin and additional markup if your money is a different currency.

Again, much more easily done with current technology. When you use a credit card somewhere, your name, information, the merchant's name, information, including geographic location, is stored and transmitted. The government most certainly can pull credit card records and freeze your card and any bank accounts. Your IP is not transmitted with a Bitcoin transaction, though we can look for what node broadcasted the transaction. If you're using Electrum as your wallet, the IP would be of a public Electrum node. Likewise if you use many web wallets, the broadcasting node will be the IP of the web wallet's server, which could be outside of the country and out of the US government's jurisdiction. If you use TOR to broadcast it directly, your IP is hidden. If you use the WiFi at the business you are in while making a purchase, again that will be the IP that broadcasts the transaction if you are broadcasting it directly. Even if you use a cellular data connection, your IP is almost always behind a NAT so it is not unique to you.


This is just silly. By the next block reward halving, around or before 2017, 3/4 of all Bitcoins that will ever exist will have been mined. If they were so sure that the future price of Bitcoin will be significantly higher, they would use their money to buy Bitcoins and hold them rather than spending it on developing mining hardware for an ever decreasing amount of new coins that are being mined.

What would make you support a hardfork for scaling? I think it’s better to have both a date and a majority of mining power support but I would not be against having an exact "flag day" if it made the proposal more popular. The plan with Bitcoin Classic is to have a date and a majority of hash power required to change the limit to 2MB and then linearly increase it up to a maximum of 4MB over a period of 2 years, which would make Bitcoin’s maximum blockchain size growth the same as Litecoin.
What objections do you have with this? Is the date not far enough ahead in the future? Would 6 months from now make it acceptable? Would you like the mining power requirement be removed and the fork happen solely based on the date? If you let me know what you would not be opposed to, I can submit a pull request to Core with the changes you agree with and we can forget about these alternate implementations.
@_date: 2016-01-14 01:47:04


Not true at all. If XT had succeeded, Core would have added BIP 101 support and either could be used the same as you can use either now. There was a branch on XT that differed from Core by adding only BIP 101, which would have made it easy to add to actual Core. In fact, a BIP 101 patch was submitted to Core before it was ever submitted to XT.  If BIP 101 activated by majority share of blocks, Core would have been forced to merge a pull request for BIP 101 within the 2 week grace period but that's the only thing that would happen. Bitcoin Core would still be controlled by the same people, as would BitcoinTalk, and Bitcoin.org.

I only use Windows for my mining computers and only because I could not get the graphics drivers working properly on Linux. Seriously, download a free, secure OS and I guarantee you this would not have happened. It won't even cost you anything. And if you can't figure out an easy to use free OS, just pay the extra cash and buy a Mac. It would have already paid for itself in this case.

Why did people take a risk and invest in computer, or other, companies in the 1980s when they could have gotten 15% interest on their money?

I should add, I hope you take security seriously now by backing up your data and formatting your system drive. Any password you have entered or changed on the compromised system needs to be reset. A key logger is something you may very well have, which captures any keyboard presses and sends them to the virus deployer. Your system could also be part of a bot net. Either way, take that system offline immediately, format the drive and restore it using read-only media.

It's not a pyramid scheme because it benefits early adopters as well as late adopters. For instance, if someone bought BTC at $1.00, they might have sold it when it hit $10.00 and taken a profit. If the person who bought it from them at $10.00, sold them when it hit $100.00, they benefitted just as much as the person who bought at $1.00. Sure there are some people who bought at $1.00 and still hold it to this day. They made more profit because they risked losing the profit they already made. The people who made the most profit were those willing to take the risk of holding when they could have cashed out. If the price hit $1,000 tomorrow, would you not sell? If you would sell, you would make a big profit but you would lose out on potentially more profit if it hits $2,000. However, if you choose to hold it, you risk the price crashing back down to $100 and losing your profit.

Yes, the address is a hash and checksum of the public key.

I opened a support ticket with them a few days ago and they got back to me within 5 minutes.

It's not arbitrary. At 9 decimal places, using double-precision floating-point format for Bitcoin amounts could cause rounding errors.

Thread title should read, "two bitcoin thefts from different users using Windows." Bitcoin-Qt runs on many operating systems and no Linux or Mac users are at risk from whatever stole your coins.

You are so full of fail. From your link:


This is the reason why you can do GPU mining efficiently on Litecoin and potentially ASIC mining in the future. If they used more RAM, they could have made ASIC and GPU mining even less advantageous compared to CPU mining. If you equate security to RAM usage and ASIC resistance, I got some bad news for you about Bitcoin.

I had this issue on the precompiled binaries for Mac OS X. I compiled it myself using Qt 4.8.5 for 64-bit architecture and it has never had a problem since for both Bitcoin and Litecoin. All Macs have been 64-bit for years now so I don't see any reason why not to use 64-bit. Also Bitcoin 0.8.3 would compile with Retina HiDPI support, the latest version does not but the latest version of Litecoin still does. I don't know why this is, it would be nice to have that fixed too.
