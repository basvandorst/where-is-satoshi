* If another transaction comes in while going to a location, zip the global around.  It is okay to have a buffered transaction or two.  Choose the zipping speed by the time between the pending transactions.
* Have the flag of the latest transaction pulse, perhaps in size or with a glowing effect.
* Show stats: transactions per hour, average transaction size, highest value, lowest value for 1 hour or 24 hour period, show a graph of these things
* Show in large type in the corners price and city of the latest transaction and transactions per some time period.

Explanation of why this is important to Bitcoiners:
USD has been the world's reserve currency.  As the world's reserve currency, nations would use the USD as their preferred currency for transactions.  This allowed the US to export much of its inflation to the rest world.  Every time the US printed money or raised the debt ceiling it was absorbed by everyone using dollars. By the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, &amp; China) reducing their use of USD, that is going to make USD less valuable and the previously exported inflation is going to be more acutely felt as it concentrates among those who still use USD.  This is a serious step towards hyper-inflation for USD.

For the most part BTC seems disconnected from the rest of world finances. Despite hundreds of merchants accepting Bitcoin, Bitcoin remains a mostly speculative vehicle. Also, driving the price down are the many miners who are cashing out their Bitcoin to upgrade to FPGA mining equipment. The drop to 25 BTC per block is still many months away.
For Bitcoin to be successful in the long term, it needs to grow at a far faster rate than absorbing a mere 50 or 25 BTC per block.

You can place an order at anytime.  If you have insufficient funds, the order is inactive.  When your funds arrive or when you have sufficient funds, your order becomes active.  It will consume other people's active outstanding orders at the best rate for your first.  When there are no longer orders that meet your price point, your order will become an active outstanding order, waiting for other people's active orders.  If you withdraw your funds, your order will become inactive.

There is very little reason to have your client connected.
You only need your client connected if you:
* Solo mine.
* Want to send coins.
* Want to check your balance.
Reasons to not be connected:
* You do not need your client connected to receive Bitcoins.
* Mobile clients and users of web based wallets do not need to be connected.
* If you have measured bandwidth from your ISP, you might reduce your bandwidth usage by being connected only when needed.
* If you keep the client running for an extended time, some ISPs will send you warning notices that your computer may be compromised and connected to a bot net.

* Bitcoin
* Open Transactions
* Ripple
Open Transactions will gateway our current Block Chain Bitcoins in and out of Open Transaction Bitcoins.  OT Bitcoin will allow people to have instant, anonymous transactions off the block chain.  This will solve an aspect of Bitcoin's scalability.  Open Transactions will also allow transactions using contracts and other curriencies.
Ripple will allow people to enter the cryptocurrency melieu without needing to use an exchange.
