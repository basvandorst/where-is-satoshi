In Norway, you have to pay 3k$+ for a drivers license (not to mention the time you spend). 
I'm not gonna get a drivers license for the sake of trading on gdax, but I think it's ridiculous that this is what they actually require

I have verified my identity on coinbase and i have btc there, but the gdax account is restricited

I'm not american, and i dont have any kind of drivers license
Are you saying the only way to use gdax is to verify the drivers license question?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:40:54
I do, because it says my account is restricted
I have verified my coinbase account with passport, and when gdax asks me to complete my verification it shows a checkmark below the passport, but asks me to either sign up as a business account or to show a drivers license...

My account is restricted, I need to verify it, but i cant use the passport cause I already showed it to coinbase. It just leaves me a checkmark below the passport choice. I can pick "sign up ass business" or try to verify a drivers license, but I dont have one

Thanks a lot for replying here.
I have a passport, which is verified
and i have a debit card, and a travel insurance card
other cards would be such as student cards, but that wouldnt be relevant i think

If only i had a drivers license...

I dont have a drivers license, so thats not relevant, and I dont have a business i can sign up as, and i cant show my passport, because that is grayed out and has a checkmark below it. Which leaves me with no options but to not use gdax
