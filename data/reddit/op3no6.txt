I almost certainly will pay. 
Have they already bought the coins? I thought they would wait until my transfer processes and then purchase them at the agreed rate. Do they purchase them at the moment of transaction. I suppose that would actually make sense.

I was thinking of doing either a cash deposit or a Credit Union transfer to a reputable trader rather than in person meets. I assume you don't need to be geographically close
I was just looking at the front page for common rates, so I can't verify my local rates are great.

I know, it's so unenlightened.
It's really those damn Dunmer you have to worry about...

I wouldn't mind losing the account, but I wouldn't want to harm other users. I'll probably keep the transaction. My main question is whether it will be simple to transfer my coins to another wallet I have full control over.

I figure the rates will rise again. It was just a question "can I?" It seems I would find more trouble cancelling, so I almost certainly won't. 
The difference is I haven't "eaten" my product yet, so I thought it wouldn't be a huge deal. But apparently they face fees. I didn't know it might cause them issues.

Well...if you don't think that the Whigs are destroying this country, go back to England.
Skyrim is for the Nords.

Do they charge you by raising the exchange rate higher than the going rate or do they find some other way?
Checking the site now, it seems most offers aren't too much higher than the exchange rate at the moment.

In this case I can certainly see why withdrawing the transaction would be very unethical. I definitely won't do it. I'm not in the business of ripping an institution off.

I wouldn't be too upset. I'm more or less using them as an intermediary because it's convenient to my payment method.
At the worst, I'll just go through the extra steps to set up a way to buy it from localbtc.

Sounds good. This puts my mind at ease, ignoring the fork.

Everybody knows they're all rapists and murderers. 
Look up penile spines. Cat rape is no joke...
