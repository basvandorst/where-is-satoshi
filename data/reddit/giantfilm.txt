This slide correlates positively with the gold slide and negatively with the dollar jump.
in other words, because confidence in the dollar increased, there is less demand for precious metals and bitcoins.

to understand bitcoin you need to understand
-computer science
-how computers talk to each other
-large networks of computers
-the ways in which computers network with each other
-distributed systems
-computers &amp; distributed systems

pretty sweet, but like others have said, its a little complicated and references the dollar. I propose getting rid of the nubs on the s, so its just an 's' in the @ symbol

this. the government is way more powerful than you, do not ruin your life for a few extra bucks.
@_date: 2019-03-25 20:47:22
banks give interest lower than inflation, way lower in fact. coinbase storing your money for free is a good deal by comparison.

No you have it backwards, we have to act like we dont want women involved. Then the femenists will start pushing it.

I think thats just the general trend of young Americans, not really bitcoin specefic.

"look, the entire worldwide economy is crumbling because irresponsible governments inflated currencies into oblivion, maybe we shouldnt centralize that much power"
op: "pff, so dramatic..."
@_date: 2019-03-14 16:33:37
good point, Bitcoin has little chance of a bull run until there is a major financial panic of some kind. Then we *might* see some fireworks, but maybe not.

no, people will realize the economy sucks under Trump and turn to socialism/communism and the USA turns into Venezuela
@_date: 2019-03-22 15:36:52
if you think American isnt imperialist you dont understand the monetary system.
inflation is to taxation as a fiat world reserve currency is to imperialism.

lots of people are out of the labor force, and a lot more are working shitty jobs. the debt is skyrocketing and tariffs are a terrible thing for any economy.
Trump and the government are just saying its coming back to life but saying it doesnt make it so
@_date: 2018-10-30 22:04:51
no its the deep state
@_date: 2018-10-30 16:29:19
yeah, I assume the people in power are just opportunistic and take what they can get in the chaos. The idea that everything is being controlled by a puppet master or deep state seems unlikely.
But the worst are people who believe in the deep state AND believe that they defeated the deep state by electing Trump.

We know cops are arresting innocent people for prison slavery but we just accept it, and a lot even praise the cops. 
We know there are corporations that get rich selling to the military which is a drag on the economy but do nothing, and a lot praise the military.
we know taxes have risen from 10% to 40% in under a century, meanwhile poverty, education, healthcare, etc only get worse. yet people believe that if we keep raising taxes we can fix those things.
we are brainwashed as fuck in America

 its happening now, but the government is fudging all the important number like cpi, employment, and gdp

Is there any estimate or upper bound that the creator of bitcoin could have?
Is it possible they have 99.99% of bitcoin, and that they are waiting for it to go mainstream, at which point they own the world?

for any symbol there is a 1/7776 chance of getting 5 in a row, 10/7776 of getting 4 in a row, and 85/7776 of getting 3 in a row.
For each prize in your matrix you multiply the odds by the prize and add all these together, this is the expected value of prize for the player.
In your example its like .25 or something, which means for every dollar spent the player gets 25 cents back.
Here is an example that gives an expected payout of .48
5-in-a-row: 75-60-50-45-40-35
4-in-a-row: 20-17-14-12-10-8
3-in-a-row: 10-8-6-4-2-1
you can fiddle with the numbers, but hopefully this helps you understand the math
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:40:25
why is eth a scam?
@_date: 2019-04-17 22:00:43
you created something of value, and banks can create money to buy it. But a promise to give someone money is fundamentally different than money itself.

how do you know it was one individual? could also be a government.
@_date: 2019-04-09 15:22:54
what does 'fuck your bags' mean? But to give some credit to OP, corrupt banking/finance is one of the most pressing matters of society, as far as I can tell. (but not saying bitcoin is capable of solving it)
@_date: 2019-04-17 21:53:53
Yes, all the smart people know banks are working to benefit the common man!
@_date: 2018-11-02 16:34:13
gold can work as a store of value provided you can survive until the next prosperous time, or flee somewhere.
But yeah, while things are ugly it wont do much.
@_date: 2018-11-04 01:08:55
If the dollar crashes 94% then a bitcoin will be worth 300k.
so yeah this seems pretty accurate
