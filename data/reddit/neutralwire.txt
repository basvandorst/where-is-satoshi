Hmm...so if people aren't buying or dealing with computer purchases, it looks like everything's alright.
But wait, let's examine this even further since this is bugging you so badly.  
Regular Person A: "Have you heard about Microsoft's new 128 bit operating system?"
Regular Person B: "128 bits? Holy hell I'm not buying an operating system that can only go 128 bits.  I download stuff now at 50 Mega bits a second.
Your examples are silly.

He won't think that after the price goes up greater than 1200 and stays there.

Been here for a while.  Had coins for several years.  Not a pumper.  bits works.  It's already working.  Hell even Gavin likes it.  You use bits on the bitcoin network--Whole Bitcoins are for the rich.  Not complicated at all.  
@_date: 2015-03-11 09:11:11
Nahh...just dickheads that realize how perfect the term bits is for marketing purposes and want to see bitcoin fail are against it.  Hi dickhead!

The image will change next year after the mining reward halves.  Demand will steadily increase as supply shrinks causing the price to go above 1200.  Everyone will freak out and the price will shoot up to over 10k and crash back down to 2-4k and the cycle will continue.

Where there's smoke there's fire.  If the defaults were changed to something other than the standard, that's a problem.  Luke Jr. has a problem.  The big cat is confirming it now so I really don't even need to chime in.  Gavin is doing a good job.  He'll keep this nut in check.  Linus Torvalds has to deal with nuts like this all the time.  The community is speaking loudly on this one.
@_date: 2015-03-02 06:26:33
No, in fact what happened is Luke Jr. decided to change something arbitrarily without asking for any feedback.  He decided to fundamentally change definitions that had been established for a few years now.  Why not simply start a damn discussion instead of the strong arm, totalitarian tactics?
Activism is a good thing.

Not at all.  Bits is IDEAL for regular people.  It's already associated with money, bit is part of bitcoin, it represents the two digits after the decimal everyone is use to, eg. 2.87, 9003.54.  Bits is perfect.  It's just people like you have ulterior motives.
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:28:03
NO IT ISN'T YOU PRICK.  Most people DON'T have the ability to make it correct.  They rely on experts.   What we need are honest, reliable experts.  Luke clearly isn't and you supporting him has others questioning you. 
Jesus Christ.  What is wrong with you people?

The problem is trust.  This guy is making the core developers look sneaky.  
@_date: 2015-03-11 20:22:54
You do realize the math is no different here than if you were comparing any currency right?
Price/Total Units = Price per unit
The only thing you've really shown is most people wouldn't know how to do this math regardless of currency.

He probably shot the pope.  Wait, no one has shot the pope?  He's probably planning on it.
@_date: 2015-03-11 16:21:20


What you're writing is stupid.  I think you believe it isn't for some reason.  That's ego.
Bits are digital money.  Done.  That's all anyone needs to know.  People don't need to be computer scientists to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-01 02:38:32
Which is exactly the reason there is so much aggravation.  Most people rely on other experts and when the experts start behaving in a shady way, we can only assume all those around them that endorse them are shady.  This makes you shady.  Do you like to look that way?
@_date: 2015-03-03 16:32:29
What?  Terrible comparison.
@_date: 2015-03-11 08:52:55
Jesus Christ...no it won't.  Hell it's used for everything under the damn sun.  One more thing ain't gonna matter one bit.  Bits are here.  Get used to it.
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:08:21
Is there a good tutorial on why this is the case?
@_date: 2015-03-11 16:04:05
So regular people can't understand that bit means money.  Interesting!  It's amazing that it's already so well established as a unit of money with a long history.

Wait, is American Banker promoting the dollar for money laundering?
@_date: 2015-02-28 05:54:41
You're going about this all wrong.  All you have to do to get what you want here is be honest.  Don't include your changes by default but strongly recommend them and explain why.  Have you tried explaining why to people?  At this point people don't trust you.  That's the whole problem man.

They should try a bitcoinAND solution.  Do both simultaneously and see how it goes.
@_date: 2015-03-11 20:56:12
No, my example above just shows how people that know anything about computers will NOT make that mistake and people that don't will.  
Still, we're narrowly, narrowly focusing on computers for some reason--probably because you can't come up with many examples outside of this space.
Also, programmers are very use to a concept called overloading.  That's pretty much all that's happening here.
