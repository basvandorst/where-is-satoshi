Do you know who owns the largest holding of BTC? Think about that for a second. I'm just trying to help you guys out

You should look into how the exchanges influence the price and rip the faces off anyone who tries to buy it. they scalp and dont actually give you accurate quotes. Exchanges are the central bank. You say you like decentralization but.....

It's funny how uninformed you are about how the market works

It's not a panic sell when they have more information than the public. It's a strategic sell that has been playing out over years. Sell just enough and let the following buy it back. You guys will buy every dip supporting them getting out at a great price

Show me they haven't

Says the person who thinks exchanges don't sell to customers.

By that theory, you cannot count those coins. You have to assume at all times there will be a sale. Just common market knowledge

Relax a little trying to be witty

Game theory and nash equilibrium probably wont have an effect on the market when the massive holders are forced to release coins for liquidity. If BTC was actually usable that would be another story

When I'm historically accurate this will be funny

IF they were to dump their BTC what would happen to the market?
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:18:39
Why would I do that, these comments really back up my theory
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:12:02
Your orders would have 0 market impact
