Yep. This further underscores just how little so many journalists (and the broader public) understand about bitcoin. They talk about it like some heroin injection apparatus

Sounds like a great idea, especially in subs where trolls are aplenty

I told my friend (who works in investment banking, finance) a while back when it was $130 or so. He said "lol pfft". Then silkroad closed, months pass. 
And I guess he hasn't been following it lately because last week he goes "lol mate, silk rd dead = bitcoin dead. what has bitcoin price action done since silk rd folded?". "$330", I replied. No response...
Interesting how those so well versed and deeply knowledgeable about traditional monetary systems can be so dismissive of something new with so much potential!

I only saw the end. There was a subtitle which said (paraphrased) "Ron Paul says bitcoin could go down in history as the thing which destroys the U.S dollar". Strangely, considering this, all I heard was Ron Paul distancing himself from bitcoin a bit. Saying how he didn't see it as being used in the future as the next big currency.

Take the silk road owner though, for instance. The FBI seized his btc, but they can't do anything with it (at least, until they waterboard him for his passkey). Compare that to if he stored his money in a bank, or in cash under his bed. That would have been seized and snapped up in a heartbeat -- and would be *usable*.


One analogy I can think of: sending cash overseas in this way is like taking a boat compared to flying (bitcoin). I would call flight revolutionary, not just innovative.
