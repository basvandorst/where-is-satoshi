Basically everyone in the world needs to agree on transaction ordering. When you have some bitcoin you can make a transaction that spends it.. but there's nothing stopping you making more than one such transaction spending the same bitcoin. In order to stop you from doing that, everyone needs to agree which transaction was first and reject all the others. The mining is essentially voting on a particular transaction order.. it doesn't matter which transactions are agreed on just that only one gets to be first/valid and any other double spends get rejected. If we had a list of identities it would be easy to hold a normal election, but no such list exists.. so the voting rights are earned by how much electricity you are willing to burn. In order to motivate people to do this they are rewarded with transaction fees and block rewards.

well, that's a context.. some other time it might be different.. the problem is that we are now relying on how "sane people" might react to something instead of a nice predictable stone cold emotionless machine like what bitcoin was supposed to be.. circumstances and reactions can be gamed by psychologists and big data.. if we rely on "sane people" bitcoin will end up just another federal reserve.. although maybe it's inevitable.

It might not be possible to pass off responsibility, but you could introduce the 3rd party right in the ToS.. like yea I'm running this website, but this agreement is also with some random US LLC that is going to sell all your info to marketers :p I dunno how it will be done, but while GDPR is kindof a noble ideal it isn't going to work until we have a totalitarian world govt enforcing it.. it may just end up making the EU a less attractive jurisdiction to start an internet business.

They probably get a lot of random requests.. if it's something unusual, it's probably better to wait for a court case to be brought because in most cases it just won't be because it isn't worth it. If the court eventually orders them to delete the account then that's fine for them too.

They buy at a premium price from bitpay and other large merchants, maybe even on localbitcoins and paxful while selling on just one or two big exchanges to set the price. You can even overpay quite a bit and sell at a loss because you're only selling a part of what you bought.. it's a sacrifice to keep the price down on the main exchanges and thereby keep it lower at all the venues where you're buying.
Futures help by redirecting upward pressure from the main exchanges to another non-price setting venue (cboe, cme).

IMO it doesn't.. although I would like to adjust my previous comment, in that larger companies probably have more to fear from GDPR.. they have more users and thus more potential damages and also on a per use basis it's probably much cheaper to adjust their processes and make sure they're compliant. In reality a lot of GDPR can (and will) be avoided using contracts with 3rd parties located outside the EU.

probably false.. the clearing house is a collection of business relationships.. sure there's some software that they use, but it could be swapped out or upgraded to support cryptographically signed transactions on bitcoin/rootstock/anything else just like they've probably swapped it out several times already for other features/upgrades.. also clearing houses are pretty efficient.. don't necessarily need a huge staff or have a large amount of overhead compared to the amount of business transacted and it has the advantage of already being there, so for a long time it will definitely be cheaper to keep using it than switch to something new.

It sounds like you're in the US? In which case I'd say this won't work at all.. generally speaking you can only and accounts in the same name.. if they don't check, you can sometimes lie about it, but probably that isn't the case with coinbase as I think they check by making you do an inbound payment first (which shows the originating name).. and if you have a US account I think adding any UK or Irish accounts won't be possible anyway.

well.. the problem is that services may demand access to your bank account in exchange for using them.. saying "I only use crypto" will probably be the same as saying "I don't have a bank account".. they'll just deny access.. so I don't really see how it would help.. either way you don't get to use whatever service is demanding access to your bank account.

I think it is.. but for example if you invite someone into your channel, they would be able to block any further payments by not signing. The more parties involved the more likely someone will have to unilaterally close the channel anyway because someone else went offline and won't sign. Still.. 3 isn't so many parties.. so perhaps that could work.
The new 3rd party joining a payment channel would need a new penalty transaction to discourage the first two from ripping them off.. such a transaction could be produced if both of the original channel members sign it. You might need to construct two different ones, one for each potential violator.. with the balance split proportionally between the original member and the newcomer. Or maybe the newcomer should still all be able to claim all of it. not sure what's best..
If you did it proportionally then say one of the original channel owners tries to close out the channel using a previous state.. the newcomer can attempt to use the penalty tx, but they might only get a small amount of it (proportional to their share) with most of the channel funds going to the other original party. That same original party would also have a previous punish tx from the original channel opening where they would get all the funds.. so they would probably use that one to attempt to claim all the funds. So now we have three mempool (racing to be onchain) transactions.. one illegal state and two punishers.. but the only one where the new party gets any funds is one of the punishers and even there they only get part of it..
So you could also set it up so the newcomer gets an all channel claim punish tx, but both original members need to sign off on it, and it kindof puts them at more risk since they might get screwed over in the same way as a the newcomer in the previous example.

I'd guess that the goal is to limit the amount of BTC an individual can purchase in 1 day. Obviously it doesn't really work, but it might work well enough that it discourages people from doing it. 
I guess the phone number does sometimes track back to an identity, and maybe the spy agencies can get that somewhat reliably.. I don't know, but a pattern of commonly connected cellphone towers and metadata such as who else you phoned/phoned you and who uploaded your phone number to facebook or whatsapp etc could probably nail down the owner if it were a matter of national security :p
@_date: 2018-10-24 00:47:16
I'd guess that the value of the data from one phone is so low that any amount you could afford to pay for it would in no way compensate for the trouble of installing the app..
probably the way to go would be to pay other apps to include it as malware.. and i guess you could maybe pay them a more substantial amount in bitcoin to facilitate that.

Technically it's going to be tricky allowing LN (or normal bitcoin) payments to work on the wifi so that they can pay you while blocking everything else so that they have a reason to pay (unless you just setup a splash screen with a voluntary donation address - which tbh might actually work better since I'd expect very low initial usage). I'm not even convinced this is possible really but maybe some kind of simple heuristic like you get 5min of free access (time enough to send a payment) and then cut off for half an hour unless you pay.
I think LN might work better than on chain btc payments.. the tx fees for onchain are too high for paying a few cents and if you have to wait for confirmations forget about it.. 
There are always emergencies when people are willing to pay lots for internet access but most of the time they don't really want to pay anything at all.. I'm not really sure what kind of pricing model would work best.. maybe if you imagined an always on service costing $30/mo and just pro-rata that (so 10 minutes would only cost $0.006845), it'd be cheap enough that sometimes people would use it as their main internet thereby delivering enough value to be worth their while learning how to use it.. talk about it and get others interested.

The difficulty really would be having a wallet that can communicate with this new payment protocol.. or rather, making a standard and getting wallets to adopt it. Something like this might be useful in a PoS environment too so maybe it will get made eventually.. although maybe it would be better to do that over NFC or bluetooth rather than wifi.
The reason I suggested a simple 5min open access is that maybe it could work with existing wallets that way. It sounds like you want them to have a pre-installed custom wallet/client.. that might work too.. it makes it unlikely to be used by people needing an emergency quick fix, but if it's something people are going to use all the time then maybe they would do it.
The pricing I think is a problem though.. for people to want to use it, it probably really has to be dirt cheap.. which means initially and really maybe forever there's very little profit to be made for operating a wifi node.. if it can be setup by installing an app on your android phone then maybe some people will just do it even if it doesn't make them any money, but if you have to re-flash your router or maybe even root your phone it's not something most people will bother with.. and if there aren't many nodes then noone will bother to look for them either and thus won't find the few that do exist either.

so far bitmain is selling their ASICs.. as the hardware replacement cycle slows down the number of ASIC chips in existence will start to exceed the amount of cheap electricity available to run them.. and certainly it will dwarf the amount of cheap electricity available to bitmain to run their own mining operations.. so they will be motivated to continue selling chips.. competitors will also catch up.

There's no significant computational effort..  the path finding might take significant real time though.. like maybe a few seconds.. so frequent sub-second payments might prove troublesome.

not really no. it would be possible to have them in a trezor type device, but it would need to be connected to send/receive and you would also have to pre-generate and sign some other channel closing transactions in case your counterparty tries to cheat while the trezor is unplugged. this may not really be a huge problem in practice.. it would also be possible to have a custodial solution to receive online payments and then you connect the trezor periodically to retrieve the coins from the custodial service and move them to a trezor controlled ln channel.. so I guess you can *store* LN channels in cold storage, you just can't update the channel while it's offline.

maybe.. basically you can open a payment channel to someone, spend the funds in it and then try and close the channel using the initial state (where you owned the funds in it).. when you do a unilateral channel close there is a certain number of blocks timeout.. in doing so you also reveal a secret that the other party can use in conjunction with the real channel state (where they own the money) to close the channel out in their favour with no timeout.. but if they don't then after the predefined timeout you'll get to steal the money.. still there's a chance their node might crash and not be online to notice you cheating and then you succeed.. you could probably also ddos the node for a few hours to make sure it's offline.. or monitor the network and just find some unstable nodes that frequently go offline and try to cheat them when they go down..

I disagree... there will be stablecoins, but they will come with a lot of bullshit rules.. you can see the start of it in the [bank of england's paper]( on the subject of central bank crypto cash.. basically they want to launch it as a parallel GBP with it's own monetary policy distinct from cash GBP and reserves GBP.. they would be convertible only by going through another instrument such as treasuries so although they say they will mostly be convertible, the central bank has no obligation to do so, and perhaps in extreme circumstances the prices would diverge significantly in the free market. Basically the crypto GBP would be similar to the offshore chinese yuan renminbi vs onshore one.. CNH/CNY.. kindof the same, but actually not.
So.. yea they'll exist and people will use them, just like people use tether and bitshares today.. but gradually people are going to gravitate towards pricing things in BTC because of convenience and lack of bs.. imho.

You could perhaps pull it off with a small miner or pool relying on the p2p network.. but all the major mining pools maintain connections to each other so it wouldn't be possible with them.. 
You would have to completely isolate the miner from the rest of the p2p network.. it could be fixed simply by the miner connecting to any other legit node they could find. It could happen, but it's hard to pull off and pretty easy to mitigate once noticed.

It might be once adoption has risen enough.. the main disadvantage is that if the recipient wants fiat, they're going to have to sign up for a bitcoin exchange. The only places where efficient bitcoin exchanges exist are also served by other services like transferwise that don't even require them to sign up since the sender can do everything. There's also the issue that money transfer services like transferwise often don't require either party, but certainly not the recipient to ID verify.
If the recipient wants fiat, then the double conversion fiat to btc to fiat, is likely going to always be more expensive than a single conversion between two fiats.
so yea.. it isn't a great use case at the moment.. once everyone accepts BTC directly for anything, maybe it will be.. and along the way if you ever do want to pay someone internationally who is already familiar with BTC then it's probably a good way to pay them.

Only nodes on tor would be able to connect to your onion address.. however your node can connect out through tor to regular nodes. The onion addresses are distributed throughout the p2p network though, so it should be discoverable by other tor nodes if that's what you meant.

making it legal tender won't make any difference.. Maybe you mean making it the only unit of account, so that all accounts and tax returns were filed in BTC? That'd be interesting heh.. maybe once it's stabilised a bit more.

IMO we need to get rid of "intent" based crimes in trading.. something shouldn't be legal for one person or another based on what they were thinking at the time.. it just creates perverse incentives to come up with alternative excuses for doing stuff rather than preventing people from doing it.
@_date: 2018-11-09 20:29:17
not sure what point he was making, but what you've quoted is certainly not true.. it's quite possible to double-spend with much less than 50% of the hash power.. it just means you need more luck.. or really time (and money to burn on a prolonged attack), since you can keep trying until you get lucky - which you eventually will.
edit: for example, Antpool - which has ~16% of the overall hash power mined 4 blocks back to back (549054 - 549057) just a couple of days ago (was the first &gt;3 in a row I could find).. that's enough for them to have deposited some funds to an exchange and then un-deposited them 3 confirmations later. In order to do that, they would have to forego the block rewards they would otherwise be mining possibly for several days.. and probably suffer reputational damage and the loss of the exchange account where they doublespent.. although in theory at least they could deposit a lot of BTC and maybe it would be worth it.
@_date: 2018-11-09 00:20:23
I think it might be better to adopt the view that there isn't really such a thing as a manipulative trade.. if people see some trade feed and react to that because they think it means something maybe that's their own fault if it turns out that it doesn't really mean what they thought it might? It seems like a more rational approach than trying to ban making trades because they might confuse people. Basically the problem is that people have broken expectations about what might come down the wire.. They just should not be making trades based entirely on what other people are trading.. they should be trying to value their assets independently and making their own value judgements.

I guess you forgot to count putting the $100k into a 2.5% ROI adjusted for inflation investment along side the house. I mean, it seems only fair to do that if you're going to invest the hypothetical interest payments on one side, you should invest the hypothetical principal on the other. 
Forget working out the numbers for specific cases.. really the only reason buying in cash would work out better is if there are no opportunities worth more than 2.5% (or whatever the mortgage rate is) to invest in.. maybe we'll get there with negative interest rates.. although maybe we'll have negative interest mortgages too.
One reason for going all cash is just the simplicity.. it saves you having to worry about it so you can maybe count your own saved time as an profit and that can be worth a lot.

you'd have to say what jurisdiction, but most likely if it's a one off personal transaction rather than your friend operating a business it's probably legal.. and perhaps more to the point, noone will care.

1 device can be profitable.. it needs to be efficient and you need cheep electricity.. and obviously you can't pay too much for the device in the first place. The advantage with 1 or a few devices is that you might not need to find space with industrial electrical hookups and cooling. 
If you want to solo mine blocks at regular intervals then you need a percentage of the overall hashing power.. maybe around 50,000 s9's would get you to around 1% of the network so that you'd be mining 1.4blocks per day - 1% of 144.

It was listed before.. removed in this [commit]( back in 2014 with the comment "Bitcoin might be a distributed client protocol, but it is definitely not a computing project".
Somewhat inconsistently there is currently listed an apparently defunct project called Computing for Humanity that claims to mine crypto for charity. The same user also deleted namecoin with a similar comment.
Other projects such as RC4 cracking don't really seem much different than sha256 mining either..

imo it won't take much to ignite a rally.. there isn't much supply and there are a lot more users with verified bitcoin exchange accounts this time around. One of the things that killed the last rally was almost every exchange suspended new accounts.

Simple; people with BTC have to consciously buy investment products, eg: funds, bonds, buy an ICO, etc. They swap their BTC for some kind of IOU. 
The BTC can then be used to fund some endeavour and hopefully the profits can buy back BTC to repay the fund/bond investor + interest. If the investment fails, the investor doesn't get their BTC back.. or at least, if the government wants to insure or bail out any investors the government will need to find the BTC somewhere to do that, not just create it out of nothing.

You might be able to have your LN payments delivered as tether (or some other stablecoin).. then you can just cash out the tether periodically to your bank. 
The only requirement is that there is some gateway node that is connected to both BTC and tether LN networks and provides a routing path between them.. none of that exists yet, but it probably will one day.
Maybe in the further future banks will just allow generating LN invoices that deposit straight into your bank account.

BTCPay is supposedly compatible with bitpay - which seems to have a webhook for [invoice paid](

you can sell them on localbitcoins.com or paxful.com but you won't get a good price. prepaid cards don't really work with bitcoin (and provide no real anonymity due to pervasive internet spying), the best thing to do with one is spend it on groceries or your phonebill and use the money you would normally have spent on those to buy bitcoin from your bank account. maybe look for a bitcoin atm and buy using cash.

wallets contain addresses. calling getnewaddress makes more addresses in the same (default) wallet. When you call sendtoaddress, the wallet decides which addresses to spend from.
You can reuse addresses, although it's not considered good practice.

Not in that way.. exchanges will probably accept LN deposits and withdrawals too.. but more transactions is more utility is more value, so yea LN should make bitcoin more valuable.

Mostly they can make money on the interest.. tether has currently USD 1,891,398,705 in deposits.. 3 month US treasury notes yield 2.33%, so they could be making USD $44 million/year for doing not much.. it's a valid business model.

bitcoin targets 144 blocks per day (1 every 10min) regardless of hash rate, price or block reward. Over time miners receive a percentage of the block rewards equal to their percentage of the total hash rate. If you know the percentage of their overall hash rate you can easily calculate how much money they would gross.. however it's not possible to know how much profit that will be as it depends on how much electricity they are burning (and sunk capital on mining machines, air conditioning, personnel etc).. in short the price of bitcoin and the block reward are not useful on their own to determine miner profitability.

If someone makes their own custom data format inside the blockchain and then makes a custom viewer for it, is the data in the blockchain or the viewer?
 You could use the blockchain as a one time pad and 'encode' anything you want on it.. I think most people would agree that doesn't count.. but what if you used a compression algorithm so that the viewer side has less bytes than the blockchain 'pad' part? 
At what point is the illegal data on the blockchain rather than in the viewer?

There can be multiple UTXOs on the same address, but you can only spend a UTXO once. It doesn't matter if there's another UTXO with the same address (ie "the address still has a balance") as the transaction designates specific UTXO inputs that are either spent or unspent.
