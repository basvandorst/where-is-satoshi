When moonbo?

I like how you disguised and wrapped: I'm the man, listen to me. And discredit the hodlers. 
The least thing you can do now you demonstrated your wisdom is to provide us with your guess of how much BTC will go down. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 11:23:33
Is this the famous flag forming on the BTC 1day chart??! I need TA, TA here pls, quick! Breakout on 5 march?!
@_date: 2018-03-02 12:41:55
What about the tech?
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:04:38
Thank god for TA, we all saw this coming. Classic inverted head and shoulders, easy game.

I think one last time we go back to  €6,8k tonight before we go to €6,1k - €5,8k freefall to  €4k or €3k and shoot back up to €5k - €6k where it will stay for 5-7 weeks. In the process lots of ICOs wont survive. Starting a slow new bullrun. Thoughts on this guess?

You're here to find this: yes, it's really over this time after 10 years, this one is it :( bye
@_date: 2018-03-03 07:23:25
Price looks unhealthy, should be way higher
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:15:22
You seem irritated. Is the anger coming from fear and uncertaintity about your beliefs in the product?
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:50:25
Cryptowinter is starting, time to tether up cause we will go to 4k tomorrow.. So sad
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:42:13

@_date: 2018-03-18 13:41:27

Darn whales bumping the prices when we're all shorting. They RUN this game, get out now or lose all your corn!
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:29:24
You have seen
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:50:47
Its the classic bubble burst based on previous bitcoin bubbles and the last support levels during 5 feb crash .Edit- ofc the numbers are ballpark
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:55:34
Why not, it will just take some time still to be confirmed
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:49:19
No this time it's serious. im sorry 
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:57:19
Hold my bags, says the whale
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:02:33
All ready for some capitulation? What is your breaking point?
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:39:05
Great day for making some extra bitcoin on the dollar right guys? Dont worry, this is good for Bitconnect.
@_date: 2018-03-19 10:58:30
Not gonna lie, this one sucks, but i don't regret the move
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:33:00
Thanks BitcoinAlways for sharing your predictions, honestly, we don't deserve you here. 
Guys, if you can all stop by for a second to thank BitcoinAlways for this service! Just a thank you will do. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:28:45
Everybody is reassured this is a double bottom so we won't go lower than 6k. But than it would not be capitulation, so logic dictates BTC will go to 1-2k
