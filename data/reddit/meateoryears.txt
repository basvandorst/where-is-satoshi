Gotcha!  Thanks.

They still make money on pre paid cards. But not on bitcoin. They're running a business. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 01:21:07
Not yet they don't.

I'm curious about the app now.  Tell more?
@_date: 2014-12-23 22:53:49
That's understandable. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 21:43:42
how anonymous

Gasp!  Beware of the apple watch!

What do you plan to do?  I am in the boat, obviously in a channel now.  :|

I agree with you.  This is pretty much an advertisement, and then a bunch of whining when the ad doesn't gain any traction.
@_date: 2015-04-08 17:59:12
Interesting.  You made an advertisement, and then complained a couple times when it didn't find any traction?  To be honest, that behavior is slightly annoying.  And I'm a coinbase user.

Don't believe in God or gods bud. I can just imagine my family and peoe I grew up with in the Midwest throwing bitcoin to the wolves because someone shared this image on Facebook. They'd claim that it was evil and will spread that idea like wildfire. I'm fairly indifferent about this sort of thing, but it is counter productive. 
And your invalid judgement is immature.

Cool art, but no way is satoshi God. Or if this is going to have cultish connotations, this is gonna put the community in a very bad place. How about no reference to cults, or deities.

The imgur link says "just because we think of Satoshi as God".
Did I not read that correctly?
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:01:32
Wow. Now who is out of touch again?  And your slithering "compliments" prove you're also an asshole.

Local credit union here. They could care less.
