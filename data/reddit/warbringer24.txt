Howdy! I'm actually that exact person! Should btc die I'd be emotionally crushed but my day to day finances would be perfectly fine and right now I'm actually making a pretty decent profit. Without being a dick, had I read this post before I invested I never would have invested. I may not get filthy rich from BTC from I'll make enough and be happy with that.

Tell her you invested an amount that will not negatively impact the finances of the household and actually do that. That way you can say if it is a bubble, we sell before we hit the point where we bought it and are none the worse off and if it isn't a bubble, we make a profit.

While I like the idea of larger supply for traders, I'd see this fund as a positive. Reason being, if they don't ever release the btc into the wild then they are effectively practicing hodl

So, the actual mining is generating a SHA-256 hash that starts with x amount of zeros where x is determined by the [difficulty](
You'd sell bitcoin by transfering the bitcoin you have from a secure wallet to a wallet on an exchange and either selling it per the price (and the fees) set by the exchange at that moment in time. At which point they exchange it for the agreed upon amount of USD or whatever your local currency is. This is then transferred to a bank account from the information you have listed in the exchange.

I can't agree with banning, but a flair for "prediction/theory/the chicken bones tell me" would be nice.

You should go back to your shitcoincash subreddit. You're literally adding nothing of value or substance with your post and frankly, it's irritating. People like you are literally the reason I think the hard forks are fucktarded rather than an alternate and equally viable type of currency.

Something I read, you shouldn't neglect real life needs for bitcoin. Sure, it has potential to make you a nice stack of money, but realistically, you gotta be able to do projects and homework and all other types of things while you're in school. Do the smart thing, but a decent laptop that'll last you a while, then if you have leftover cash that you don't need elsewhere and you're fine with potentially losing it, buy BTC

I'm curious, is it the wallet you're having difficulties accessing or the computer? If it's the computer, recovering the password isn't too hard and I'd be glad to give you some tips.
Experience: I'm a Network Security major and have had to do that more than a few times.

That seems really silly (the pming of bitcoin about altcoin). Hopefully it's not the dogecoin community.

Yeaaaah same here, I still have my miners for it wasting room.

So wait, it sounds like you're saying you only want some transactions on the blockchain but never everything. To my knowledge the whole reason bitcoin works is because if you don't believe some arbitrary event occurred at some arbitrary point in time you and anyone else have the power and ability to audit the blockchain to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that x event occurred at y time. I mean sure, politics suck, this whole mess with china and BIP148 and SEGWIT and all this shit has been annoying and irritating but that doesn't mean we should take out tiny transactions, that's why we have trust in BTC because we don't have to trust some entity, we can instead look at the block chain and navigate it without any obstructions.
 Any deviation from that in my opinion would destroy the trust we have in the blockchain simply because it wouldn't record everything, even if it's just a coffee purchase.

Except satoshi, to my knowledge, hasn't said a word since the release of his white paper outlining bitcoin. Faker news than Obama causing the 2013 shutdown
@_date: 2019-01-13 11:54:06
1) Welcome to the internet where you can use whatever name you want without being the more famous person behind the name. I could have Barack_Obama as a username and by your logic I'd be him.
2) no mention of a hard fork just "I just now uploaded rev 134"
Gonna stop feeding the troll now.

White paper was released in 2008, article is lying and you're actively promoting it.

Look, I get the frustration and anger but really? Its just people who believe they are doing what's right. Is it right? I dunno I haven't studied the white paper enough to say but in as far as I understand it, its not an attack unless all miners simply stop mining BTC which will never happen given its value. So maybe ease off the rage and accept that they think differently than you and to some extent, I (honestly I'm just in it for the monetary potential and the non reliance on money is based on the value of money" bullshit idea).
