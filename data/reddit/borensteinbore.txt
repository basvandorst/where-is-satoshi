I think you will be fine.  Someone will come along presently to say that LE in the US has never used blockchain analysis to arrest anyone, except for that silk road guy, or something.

It was resolved satisfactorily, however, I just don't understand why my salin account, an actual bank account, was seemingly unable to even begin the process of verification, while my amex card, which is just a prepaid card, actually almost got verified.

They are fucking idiots.  I set up a coinbase account so I could sell very small amounts of bitcoin that I was receiving for some small-time freelancing.  I verified my identity and all the stuff it asks you to do when you join.  
I attached the coinbase account, to my bank account for verification, and it was verified.  I entered the two amounts that they put into my account, and it went through.  I have all the emails saying that the bank account was verified, and I even got my coinbase account upgraded, you know how it raises the limit that you can buy or whatever?  Well my account even got to the point where I could buy and sell bitcoin.  Like, I mean, my account was just about as verified as you can get.
A few days later, I moved the small amounts of bitcoin I made, into the coinbase wallet to get ready to sell it.  When I say small amounts, I mean like 20 bucks.  I didn't take any other action other than moving my coins from an electrum wallet to the coinbase wallet, I didn't try to sell any bitcoins or buy any, or whatever.    The next day I got an email saying that they were unable to verify my bank account, so I logged into coinbase, and sure enough, there was no bank account attached to my coinbase account anymore.  I shook my head in disbelief and moved all my coins back to my electrum wallet.  I haven't been back to coinbase since.
I know that I wasn't a huge moneymaker for them or anything, so as a customer, I am no big loss..... but in the future I may have started buying bitcoin, or selling more of them, who knows?

A lot of financial institutions do that 'security question' thing.  I have a credit card that, every time I log into their site, I have to answer the dumb question.  It's just how it works.  
I bet that if you emailed support, they would open your account back up pretty quickly.

no, it was salin, which is a terrible, terrible bank, I know, but it is what it is.

I'm not ever going to fuck with any of these exchanges.  If I ever need bitcoins, I just buy a visa giftcard and use giftcarddrainer.com.  It is worth the 19% premium to avoid all these gay exchanges and their gay way of doing things.

Maybe it can be set up as a site designed to help introduce people to bitcoins who otherwise would feel like it was too complicated.
I don't have anything else concrete beyond that sentence to help you, sorry :/

I thought so too.  I would have handled it much better, while still making the feds feel like the worms they are.....

Ok sent, though more out of curiosity and love of a good mystery than anything else.  I already spent the little bits of bitcoin I was going to convert, so I don't need to sell them anymore.  
Also, while looking through my email account, I see hints that I tried to verify two accounts at coinbase:  the salin one, and then an Amex card that has an account and tracking number.  
One of those two, admittedly I am not sure which one now, was verified and then un-verified, but I don't have the actual old emails anymore to make sure.  The 'hints' I was referring to are emails back and forth from those financial institutions in the same time frame.
Anyway, if you find out why it was verified, and then un-verified, I would like to know.  It's pretty wierd, never seen that before.
