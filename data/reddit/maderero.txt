Thanks. I would have liked to keep the original font, but I could not find it (using whatthefont), and the original had a lot of artifacts. Everything here is remade to look crisp.

"YUM" and both the cap and hashrate are pretty strong with worldwide adoption of taters of every variety.

Hopefully it plummets for a few weeks. I missed the buy window at $1800.
