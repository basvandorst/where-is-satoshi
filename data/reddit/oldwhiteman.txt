He is not lacking economic knowledge but he sees how things are going to be in the future.
There will be no more jobs for humans or very little and very specialized. What are you going to do with the rest?
How do you think a future economy is going to work when 90% of the people have no income? Wars like they the system did in the century before ?

I run a Bitseed node 0.15.0.1 and would like to update to
0.15.1 but there is no update from Bitseed .
Is there an other way to do it?

I think bitit was a marketplace where you could buy all sorts of things.
Remember my first ever bitcoin buy was some kefir seed from a Greek guy

My believe is that derivatives are an other instrument for the super rich and institutions (banks in the long run) to get out of the failing fiat system.
The other thing for them is to get into crypto with a nice profit by suppressing the price until they have done the change over.

Mind to tell me how did you connect to the Bitseed node(with Laptop and LAN cable)?

The one's installed are running 0.14.0.1 or earlier.
All nodes should run 0.15.0.1 to reject Bizcoin(2x).
Corrected typo
