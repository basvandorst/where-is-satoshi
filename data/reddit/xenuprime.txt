Probably one one of these "I just found an old hard drive with 1000 bitcoin!" people selling off chunks.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:22:31
No problem! I'm glad I went with the Ledger by the way. It's simple, kind of elegant in design, and secure.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:31:42
Go home bitcoin, you're drunk.

My toddler loves it when I blow bubbles for her, I am therefore a bubble expert. Can I be a guest on your channel?

The box does not come sealed (it used to). There is a card in the box explaining this and also there's an app from ledger you can use to authenticate the nano.

This is almost my exact thoughts and plan. The only difference is I parked the bitcoin I sold in litecoin. I've got some money ready to buy in, just waiting on that sweet dip.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:08
8,359.60 exactly. If I'm wrong, I'll go to Costco and eat a hot dog combo.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:12:25
I bought some at 16,900, so enjoy the dip to 15k on me, lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:48:01
Yeah, but I wanted some more litecoin anyways and I caught it at a good exchange rate.

Unfortunately there's no way to cancel it. However, if no one confirms it, the transaction will eventually be kicked out (canceled). I have read that takes anywhere from 3 days to a week (not sure if it's a range or one or the other).
I think some wallets let you basically add more to the fees, but you'll have to check the support or faq if your service for that info (or their sub reddit)

Thanks, that makes sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:09:28
Lol, I don't buy at ATH, but I'm good at buying before the bottom of dips.

When they see their $10 become $10.25, $10.80, $12, etc, they will get excited and want to put in more themselves. The main part of the gift is giving them access to the future.

Sign up at an exchange (gdax, Kraken, etc.), deposit your BTC to your new exchange account, then sell them. After that you just withdraw your money onto your fiat account from the exchange.

I get that kind of stuff. I have been HODLing since August and have a ledger.
Now, if ebay or Amazon, etc. started holding coin effectively  in "escrow", that could work.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:03:54
I'll check them out, but how do you know they are official? I'd really like to find a list or something from Ledger themselves.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:02:53
Based on reviews, they are neck and neck, but the price and form factor pushed me over to Ledger.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:02
Bought some at 8990, and will keep on doing so every dip into 8k. HODL!
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:02:06
Your logic sounds good, but what about the change in difficulty coming up in an hour? That should cause a spike on its own.
Edit: thereby interfering with phase 3.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:47:35
True. Since last night I'm seeing more mainstream news outlets reporting on the current issues. That (as it would with stocks) play into the psychological effect.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:58:34
Waiting on a deposit into gdax, so I had to use coinbase with my debit.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:08:59
Your analysis is flawed. You didn't take into account the inverse tachyon pulse shown in the peak Snapple hooktail chart.
Never the less, your conclusion is sound: up or down.

[Never forget ](
P.s. Shaka when the 9000 fell.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:34:54
I saw that, but when you click on the US Amazon link, it just goes to Ledgers own closed Amazon store.
Edit: nevermind,  I tried a different browser and now I can see the list you are talking about. Thank you so much, this is what I was looking for!!
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:34:36
At least if it goes unconfirmed, it will eventually get kicked back, right?
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:37:36
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:28:21
Same to you man, best of luck!
I have no doubt it will recover IF it dips further, so we should both do fine.
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:33:43
Ledger Nano s
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:22:26
I sent it, but it's still unconfirmed after 35 minutes (I sent it at highest speed). I imagine it might take longer because segwit to legacy?
I just sent some via legacy at normal speed and it only took less than 5 min
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:52:25
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:17:07
Ah, thanks! Didn't think to check that because it seemed fine at the send time (that's what ledger said). Meme pool filled up quick!
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:53:19
Thanks. I knew it was backwards compatible,  but I haven't tried it yet and wanted to confirm.
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:22:43
I don't know, we could see slight sell off tonight. That's why I'm sending my remaining BTC over to the exchange, so I can dump and rebut at the dip if needed. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:41:24
0 confirmations. Yeah, definitely not a binance problem (other than the fact they still haven't adopted segwit, lol).
