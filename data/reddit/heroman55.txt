This is REAL adoption.

If someone sends a transaction with a small fee and you accept it as payment as soon as its broadcast to the network (0 confirmations).
The sender then broadcast the same transaction but to a different adress that he controlls but with a larger fee so that transaction has a larger chanse to be added to the next block.
The second transaction will have to be sent before the first is confirmed. The more confirmations the first has the lesser the chanse that the second will go first.
@_date: 2016-08-18 20:02:34
Because you can transact anywhere in the world for next to no fees.
Because you don't need anyones permission to do so.
Because you can pay on even the shadiest websites without ever risking someone stealing you creditcard info.
Because a bank or government can never steal them from you in case of a economic depression or system collapse or whatever.
Because no single gorvernment/institution/corporation can decide how much your currency should be valued (inflation).
Because if supply and demand does its thing they will increase in value instad of decrease.
And last but not least, Its cool, it presents new ways of looking at the whole monetary system. It's a potential revolution that might change one of the fundamental invention and building block of human society: Money.

I suspect there are a lot of swedish bitcoin enthusiasts in this subreddit. I've notice a lot of swedish related posts get upvoted. I myself, am very interested in bitcoin and I'm working on a the first(?) swedish bitcoin-exclusive casino ATM
@_date: 2014-05-13 17:45:35
Yeah i agree, They use the website as the interface when you search for products in their stores so i imagine it's quite the project. Then again WEBBHALLEN is not really a store for the blind consumer but more for tech-savvy people and there are plenty in sweden, hence their success.

Just use circle? Create account, put in credit card, buy instantly. I don't understand why everyone don't reccomend them? It is THE best way to buy coins instantly and easy.
@_date: 2016-06-12 06:25:46
This is a stupid comparison. Comparing a digital currencys market cap to a corporations doesn't show us anything. If we would all start selling bitcoin we would get nowhere near 9B whereas you would actually be able to sell twitter for ATLEAST 9B.

They both exist on the internet but one is a currency and one is a company.

Your whole post history (11 days) is filled with badmouthing bitcoin and boosting ethereum and litecoin and you want the price to go up?
@_date: 2016-06-12 16:42:05
I'm pretty sure if twitter decided to sell all their stock they would get more than 9B.
@_date: 2017-01-02 07:39:08
I don't think they were making money on selling bitcoin regardless of the price, that's probably why they dropped it.
@_date: 2017-01-21 11:18:30
It's an option not fucking mandatory.
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:50:29
Think about it like this: If bitcoin gets "just" 21 million active users, there wont even be enough for everyone to own 1 btc each.

With bitcoins current "market cap" how much money could they even possibly be moving?? 
@_date: 2016-12-29 05:44:54
I never talk about it, I dont want to be that guy. People will learn by themsleves. Once I even managed to not mention it while my friends were talking about how cash was dissapearing and how we could find something to replace it so the government can't record everyones transactions. That was a pretty hard one. It feels good that that is a concern that the average joe has though, and maybe they'll go home and google and find their own way to bitcoin.

It's sad to see but bitmain are their own company and can do what they please. The only way away from this is for more miner manufacturers to get skin in the game.

I think punishing all miners for the actions of one bad actor is unreasonable. But as always the market decides which bitcoin is the most valuable and used coin.
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:14:27
Yeah, there is no doubt that the price might have taken off a bit too fast for the fundamemtal valuation reasons to justify the price. Thats how investments in all new technology works. The dot com bubble, 3D printing stocks, "cancer curing" biotech companies. People get overexcited at times but if you wait it out and let the technologies catch up to peoples premature expectations you can get good returns. If you look at bitcoin as a long term speculative investment the price right now won't really matter in 3, 5 or 10 years. Its cool technology, its got revolutionairy opportunities but right now maybe prise wise its in a bubble maybe its not. I thought it was in a bubble at 2k as well but i didnt sell any. I continue to use bitcoin every once in a while for the usecases that other correncies fail at providing. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 21:14:44
Are we really going to let posts like these shoot to the front page over a EIGHT DOLLAR price rise? really?
@_date: 2015-04-23 19:32:59
It is the simplest way, Download the app, create account, put in your credit card info and you are basically good to go.
@_date: 2015-04-28 07:51:25
you could register on havelook investment and invest in any stock you like, almost all mining stocks always fall due to the mining difficulty rising but there are stock like RENT  which has had a slow and steady rise and also good dividend payout. 
Remember though that these are 100% unregulated markets and they can run with your money anytime they like. I've been investing there for about two years though and they haven't yet.

I live in sweden and i also can't actually buy btc with circle yet but for some reason they accepted my card. I got my limit increased from 1.5 btc to 13 btc just by a simple email requesting it. It's not that hard, just send of one email stating your reasons. No need to bash the company. You should have known what you are getting in to when they offer such a flawless and simple service.

No, your 12 word seed can be used to recover btc from most wallet providers. It's not stored anywhere, its kind of like a password for your whole wallet and the recovery technique is a standard in the bitcoin protocol.  Write down your 12 words by hand on different pieces of paper and keep them stored safely in different places. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:38:30
usually when you sign up with a bitcoin wallet it doesnt show you your private keys. A wallet is kinf od like software that stores all your private keys for you and handles your transactions even if you have several bitcoin adressess. Every bitcoin public key has a bitcoin private key. Think about it kind of like you have several email adresses and a password for every email and a wallet manages all these email adresses and passwords for you so you dont have to know any of them, only the password for the wallet. ( even though no one would ever use email like this but it helps to explain). The 12 word seed is probably a seed that can be used to recover your wallet no matter which service you are using, etc copay, electrum and so on. The "username" you are talking about is probably your bitcoin public key, not sure about this, you might be describing your blockchain.com username. Your bitcoin arent stored anywhere, bitcoins arent stored anywhere, what is stored is the private keys, ( the password connected to every public key in order to spend the btc sent to that public key). To understand public and private keys more easely i suggest you try out this website that creates bitcoin adresses with private keys connected to them

It just means sending a transaction on the bitcoin blockchain without the main purpous being the transfer of bitcoin value. Instead you might use it for timestamps, signing messages, contracts etc.
