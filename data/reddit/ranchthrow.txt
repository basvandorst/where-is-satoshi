You think 10% dip in a day is so terrible? Oh sweet summer child.
Welcome to bitcoin 101. As with any new innovation, there's bound to be some fluctuations. Just hodl and enjoy the ride.

As with any scam, Bcash will crash and burn in time.
Bcash shills and cronies may be able to keep up the pump for a few days - heck, maybe even a few weeks - but soon they will be exposed for the scammers they are.

Ver and his cronies are pumping bcash like crazy. Right not it seems like all bcash trading on GDAX is down. Sell if you still can. I have a feeling bcash is gonna crash big in a day or two.

Cloud mining means that you're handing your money over to online strangers and trusting them to use their hardware to mine for you.
Sounds shady? That's because it *is* shady. Most cloud mining companies are scams. The few that aren't do not guarantee any profit. Save your money and just hodl.

Coinbase is a beginner-friendly exchange with a very approachable interface. Good for learning the ropes.

Nice try, shill.
Bcash (bitcoin cash) is a wannabe crypto pretending to be bitcoin. If you're dumb enough to invest in bcash, it's your loss.

Number one rule: never invest more than what you can afford to lose.
Bitcoin has huge potential and personally I'm very optimistic about its future. But, as with any investment, realize that there will be risks.

Bitcoin price rises tenfold in a few months, nobody bats an eye.
Price dips for one day, everyone loses their minds.
If people are stupid enough to freak out over the short-term fluctuations, it's nobody's fault but their own.

Is the US dollar the "best currency"? It's entirely subjective and depends on what you're looking for in a currency.
Similarly, is bitcoin the "best cryptocurrency"? We can't tell you unless you can tell us what you're looking for in a cryptocurrency.

If you're simply holding bitcoins, treat them as property.
If you made or lost money trading bitcoins, report the profit/loss as capital gain/loss.
If you mined bitcoins or if your employer paid you in bitcoins, it counts as income.

Ahh you lucky duck! I snatched some bitcoin at $15k. Made a profit already :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:55:17
First of all, don't go around telling everyone how much bitcoin you have. You wouldn't tell online strangers your exact bank balance, so why would you openly advertise your bitcoin balance?
Protect your privacy. Better safe than sorry.

Hey now, I happen to like the fact that there are psychological barriers at thousand-dollar increments. More opportunities to sell high and buy back in when the price crashes.

That is all.

Bitcoin has been through much worse, only to emerge stronger than ever.
This pump 'n dump by Bcash won't last.

"You are an idiot".
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:46:55
It's basically a discount for bitcoin. Good opportunity to buy in. In a little while, Ver and his cronies will crash and burn while we enjoy our profits.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:17:18
Most cloud mining companies are shady. This one is no exception.
Better safe than sorry. I advise you to steer clear.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:07:48
Shady indeed. Don't listen to the shills. Bcash is run by shameless scammers and everyone invests in it at their own peril.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:58:10
Let it be known that u/btcltcbch is a shill.
Bcash ("bitcoin cash") is a wannabe imitation of bitcoin. If you're stupid enough to fall for the bcash pump 'n dump, it's nobody's fault but your own.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:44:11
[According to your post history]( you know nothing about bitcoin and you're just mad because we didn't like your repeat spam posts.
Also, good job cheating on your wife. Are we supposed to believe anything you say after such a display of trustworthiness?

The first time? Oh sweet summer child...
But seriously though, buy orders and sell orders don't really mean that much. Just stay chill and hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:26:57
If I hadn't put all my expendable money into bitcoin last month, I'd be buying this dip right now. This correction should be the perfect opportunity for newcomers to buy in.
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:30:29
I don't see a problem with this. The page is informative and accurately summarizes how bitcoin works and the risks involved. As with any investment, a healthy amount of caution is always good to have.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:20:07
At this stage, bcash is nothing but a scam run by shills and cronies. Time to dump!

Bcash (aka "bitcoin cash") is a wannabe version of bitcoin. Its founders have been trying to trick and mislead people into using their imitation currency for a long time.
This price increase tonight is an effort by Ver and his cronies to pump up bcash and to undermine bitcoin. They are backed by a large group of shills who are coming into this subreddit to spread misinformation and fear.
Long story short, this is a huge pump 'n dump by some very slimy people.
