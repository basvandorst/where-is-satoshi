Well, that's something you can't do with Bitcoins...

Once upon the time in Finland I was a very small child, and I was at a ski resort with my dad. There were lots of my dad's old friends, since he used to be a ski instructor at that resort. We all stayed at a hotel, and the men were playing cards at one hotel room. Maybe enjoying some refreshments on the side.
I was of course bored to death, and tried to find something to do. Mainly, running around at the hallways like an idiot (that I am). I spotted a slot machine, of sort, and went to ask for some coins. To make me bugger of and leave them alone, I found out that not only my dad, but other guys too were happy to give me some change. Then off I went with a pocket full of coins.
Well, that money didn't last long, so I went back for more. And more I got. So off to spend it I went. The third time I went to ask for more money, one of these gentlemen happened to ask what game, exactly, did I play. He, rightly so, suspected never seen any at this hotel. I told I played the one around the corner. Men burst to laughter, after initial moment of wonder. It was a soda dispenser, which was out of order. I stuffed it full of coins without getting no more than quickly passing feeling of joy in return. 
I remember this every time I see a Bitcoin ATM. I'm skeptical at best, since I have no idea who has carried that machine there. Stuffing bills or credit card into one would feel quite sketchy.

A company refusing to do business with someone who does not fit the profile of their preferred customer is not about free speech. Like: No shirt, no service. 
Yell profanities at the line of your local McDonald's and see how that ends up. Is it about free speech? I don't think so. And no need to develop conspiracy theories out of that either.

Well, here in Finland we have just about the best health system in the world, but it doesn't include free / low cost dental *implants* (basic dental care, yes). Those are 2000-2500€ a piece. I know 'cause I would need two. Then again I have about 2700€ in Bitcoin now so... :D

I don't see the political opinion part. Well, there probably is that too, but if we look at facts only, Alex Jones has stepped over the line where his hate speech has become illegal.
*The* [*U.S. Supreme Court*]( *has repeatedly ruled that* [*hate speech*]( *is legally protected* [*free speech*]( *under the* [*First Amendment*]( *except where such speech is directed to inciting* [*imminent lawless action*]( *and is likely to incite or produce such action.*
His talk about the Washington D.C. pizza restaurant resulted as an armed assault on this pizzeria, which Jones himself openly apologized after. Now he talked (on air) fantasizing about killing Robert Muller. I see that as the reason to ban him from PayPal since that actually breaks the law.
I may be *really* off here. I don't know anything about law. Even less about American law, since I'm European, and I haven't watched more than parts of Jones' programs. So forgive me if I'm all wrong. Not trying to correct anyone.
Yet, I still don't believe US government is turning frogs gay, as Jones is claiming :D

Just concerning the post title. An average American household contain approx 300,000 items. How many of these items have little to no value for their owners? Practical, sentimental or decorative. And on the other hand, how many people would need / like to own some of these items, but can not afford these items for their full retail price? I think most people would actually have something to buy or sell to each other. 
Second hand market has always been a thing, but easy, fast and reliable payment option has been lacking. Wire transfer takes too long, and cash can be counterfeit or stolen if you are unlucky.
