Alright mate, you might have a better grasp on some of the finer intricacies of economics because you studied it and worked in the industry but it doesn’t mean you can discount everyone else’s opinion on the matter. 
You are a dick. “No one has a clue what they are talking about, but I do because I studied it”. Fuck off with your r/iamverysmart attitude. 
You are doing a great job of convincing the general public that all bankers aren’t a bunch of cunts

I’m disgusted with the attitude. The audacity to question someone’s intellectual ability because they agreed with someone’s point on economic policy. He didn’t say anything I didn’t understand. And your presumption that I was baffled by what he said puts you in the same category as him, assuming someone is stupid.

We need to encourage bright and experienced minds to condescend and patronise others or to educate others and ‘grow’?

Why didn’t I prove him wrong?! 
He didn’t make a valid point about anything. The only point he was making was questioning wether someone has clever enough to agree with someone else’s opinion

Let me re-phrase it. 
If your head hurts because you have a brain tumour do you understand that you need to see a brain surgeon? 
If the money that you earn by working a manual job generally doesn’t buy you as much food for your family as it used to do you not understand that there is an economic problem. 
If you are not a physicist but something falls on your head do you not understand gravity? 
I repeat, fuck your r/iamverysmart attitude.

I can’t help feel like this is your second account. 
I’m saying that you don’t have to have a bachelors degree to join in a debate. 
And I’m also saying fuck anyone who thinks they are smart enough to dis-include someone from a debate
If your so smart why not educate someone instead of being condescending and patronising.
