I'll give it a go. I really love the design and the work put into it.

@_date: 2014-07-17 00:31:27
I like the site, When would the coins be deposited?
@_date: 2014-06-16 22:09:35
This is awesome. I hope I'm in time. I'm fairly new to the Bitcoin game, I love the direction it's going in.
@_date: 2014-06-25 01:05:55
Then to the moon!! Honestly, I like Mars better. To Mars!!!
@_date: 2014-06-22 05:43:03
This is true. I've gotten into bitcoins for about 2 weeks now. I thought I was excited getting several satoshis at a time... then I noticed the transaction feed, very depressing. At least for now.
@_date: 2014-12-06 00:30:16
I don't know if you can see my hand but it is raised.
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:43:01
I went to check it after to make sure, got locked out lol. Ah well.
@_date: 2014-12-06 00:45:36
Thanks for being generous. I've been giving out bits to people at art shows, people like it lol.
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:35:06
I think I got it. Good one sir!
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:05:36
I'm still on my hour probation lol. Good luck everyone.
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:19:45
Thanks a mill. Will do, paying it forward.
@_date: 2014-12-21 23:51:45
Merry Christmas.

Bitcoin haikus:
Bitcoin is more than
just digital currency.
It is defiant.
With Bitcoin, you are
your own secure treasury.
No more hidden fees.
Instant transactions
from anywhere in the world,
for pennies of cost.
@_date: 2014-12-06 00:42:09
My first one of the night, my man!
@_date: 2014-06-22 17:13:49
Will do.
@_date: 2014-12-24 19:16:19
Imagine this, what if Santa had access to blockchain technology and/or bitcoins this whole time lol. I kind of had a great start to today. Merry Krampus to all.
@_date: 2014-06-24 23:53:51
No one has given you the right answer, I'm actually a Nigerian Prince that has over 100k in Bitcoins. I can help you easily, but you have to get me into this country. Wire me some cash and I could meet you in person to give you some BTC. 
Forgive me :)
@_date: 2014-08-04 15:57:53
I could probably be of service.
@_date: 2014-12-06 01:15:11
my connection is just slow
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:05:27
Nice! I will definitely keep an eye out for it. Good luck with everything.
@_date: 2014-07-04 16:19:16
Very good points. I'm excited about bitcoin. I can't talk about it enough with peers of mine.
@_date: 2014-12-23 03:55:22
I just looked at your site. Good stuff you are doing. 2015 will definitely be a better year. Happy holidays.
@_date: 2014-07-01 06:30:03
Happy belated cakeday by the way.
@_date: 2014-12-06 01:16:47
So true lol.
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:50:46
I would love to try but I have iOS. I would like to ask if you are planning or thinking about doing a wallet for the iPhone or iPad?
@_date: 2014-12-06 01:08:44
Will do. I have one coming up next week. I may pass out bits there as well in a paper wallet or whatnot.
@_date: 2014-12-25 04:41:17
Merry Christmas and a happy Thursday!
@_date: 2014-07-17 20:58:20
This is the only one that I saw that ships.
@_date: 2014-12-06 00:32:13
What's the point of anything? Just enjoy.
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:49:19
Well if this was 1803, 
The United States purchased the Louisiana Territory from France at a price of $15 million, or approximately four cents an acre. The ratification of the Louisiana Purchase treaty by the Senate on October 20, 1803, doubled the size of the United States and opened up the continent to its westward expansion.
Which would be equivalent to less than $.45 an acre or about $236M of purchased land.

Me thrice.
@_date: 2014-07-21 19:50:03
As an artist, this slightly pisses me off and the other half would like to create something more meaningful to bitcoin and the community. 
*goes back into the lab*
@_date: 2014-07-08 23:15:12
How new is new?
@_date: 2014-07-17 21:00:08
Not that long, I wish it was that one though.
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:44:01
Interesting use for the once link. It definitely is a great idea, scavenger hunt type of thing.
@_date: 2014-07-17 22:11:41
No problem and thank you.
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:57:37
Challenge accepted.
@_date: 2014-06-16 22:04:40
Donzo! I'm looking forward to using your site as well.

Am I too late?
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:04:16
Roger that.
@_date: 2014-08-04 14:43:55
I'll try it. I'm still a little bit confused on colored coins.
@_date: 2014-07-09 00:47:39
Thank you.
@_date: 2014-07-17 20:47:10
I love that I'm going on a long bike ride later.
@_date: 2014-07-04 15:24:23
As a new bitcoin user I'm happy that your got them back. I couldn't imagine how I would feel losing the few satoshis that I have. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 04:51:09
Thanks. I think I aimlessly wondered in at the right time. Thanks :-)
@_date: 2014-09-22 20:03:27
@_date: 2014-12-04 07:22:53
im back... i may need to sleep after this. who am i kidding?
@_date: 2014-07-06 22:31:02
What would be the time frame that you'd be looking for to complete the book? I would definitely be interested.
@_date: 2014-08-19 21:43:27
I thought the. Bitcoin Center has one. I went there Monday and for what ever reason it was unplugged. Anywho, good to know, I'll visit there before I leave to go back from visiting. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 15:54:34
Much appreciated. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 22:33:18
Dope, I'm glad you're in the city. I definitely will check it out. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 05:16:28
A key of Bitcoiners.
@_date: 2014-12-27 04:58:47
What is next for you?
@_date: 2014-12-01 17:40:54
That's a sweet little feature. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:38:40
@_date: 2014-07-10 19:57:04
It was a good survey. It definitely was better than doing a random survey for a couple satoshis. I'm eager to see the results. Good luck.
@_date: 2014-09-20 03:28:08
There comes a time in most men's lives where they feel the need to raise the Black Flag. Happy Cakeday Captain.

I have a vintage WWI carrier *pigeon* just for that. I just need to see if it still works.
@_date: 2014-07-04 13:43:42
How elated were you when your coins came back to you, better yet, if you had to compare your feeling with anything, what would you compare it with?
@_date: 2014-06-25 19:43:42
I think CoinPocket is crap, at least on my end. I downloaded it out of the app store a few days ago. Everything went fine until I went to view my private key... It's been loading for who knows how long. I have a webwallet as well as a couple of paper wallets. I even updated it as well as restarted my device. I'm slightly annoyed but I would definitely be pissed if I had put some bitcoins in it and couldn't touch it. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 00:35:56
Much thanks.
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:47:55
@_date: 2014-07-01 04:28:23
Where's the beef?
@_date: 2014-07-04 18:11:49
You should send me your remainder so you could be sitting pretty at 10BTC
@_date: 2014-08-16 22:14:11
I would also think that Satoshi's "heirs" might do something with them.Maybe they get lucky and inherit them... eventually.
@_date: 2014-07-09 05:06:26
I'm trying to amass that to tip. Just gotta get there now.
@_date: 2014-06-25 22:53:56
Thank you for taking the time to reply. I never deleted the app yet, I'm actually pretty excited. I'll definitely be on the lookout for the update.
@_date: 2014-07-04 00:27:15
AH... what a shame. Cool nonetheless. Thanks though because you just saved me a trip to try to pay with bitcoins in person lol.
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:22:36
Tuesdays are always great days now. Keep up the good work.
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:44:40
I listen to You, Me, and BTC.
I will definitely check out the others. I've been looking for more btc podcasts.
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:13:05
I definitely appreciate what you are doing. I really don't need any tips, you could pass them on if you like.
@_date: 2015-01-16 14:47:48
I'd like to help the cause.
@_date: 2015-01-01 03:48:06
@_date: 2016-09-20 21:03:55
I'm guessing I'm too late. Next time though. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 01:47:29
Happy Sunday and if you're at Jazz Fest, have a good time also ;-)

PM sent.
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:18:46
Can we add this?
Happy Tuesday!!
@_date: 2015-02-08 23:47:56
I would like to give this a go. I kind of did something on some down time I had. I can PM you a rough if you like?
