Because I'm trying to use the Eth or Ltc to buy altcoins.

What would happen if they increased the blocksize?

I thought we were all were dumping BCH?

Anyone who knows about price manipulation and Roger Ver can tell the last 48 hours were a coordinated attack on Bitcoin, from BCash.

Any idea why the sudden rise in price?

I transferred from Coinbase to Binance a few days ago and it took give or take 5 hours after the two verifications, you should be fine.

Oh I already own Iota, just wondering why you chose not to diversify.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:10:34
No, it won't.

I did through Binance. XRP is a centralized coin but it's best to diversify imo. It won't go super high but I bought around 370 for 40 cents each so it adds up if it hits $2-$5 at some point. I would also look into looking in ICX (ICON) along with XVG (VERGE) which is currently at 8 cents, was 4 cents two days ago.

Hodl. Please.

Does anyone have any advice on transferring Ltc or Eth to Binance? I want to move money from Gdax to Binance but Gdax's prices are usually $20-$30 higher than on Binance so if I buy Eth or Ltc on Gdax will it automatically be worth less once I transfer it to Binance?

You are only in this sub to spread fear. No one cares about your opinion.

Hasn't trading started? I have a buy/sell option on my coinbase acc already.

RottenRook wants you all to sell for his personal gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:31:21
It took me a total of 3 hours

So dark web transactions is real world adoption? I'll be sure to let my grandfather know he can buy drugs with his virtual money and not groceries and everyday items.
@_date: 2018-07-24 23:12:32
Still missing the actual point about real world adoption. I knew not to argue with an idiot ����‍♂️ dismiss yourself.
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:08:21
First of all, mind your business. Second of all look up the definition of sarcasm. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:21:55
Real world adoption. The "real" world we need to adopt coins are everyday consumers. Not people buying illegal items from dark web.
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:22:35
I was referring to real world adoption. Not a rise in price. Your answer doesn't correlate to my point. Do you have anything else to say?
