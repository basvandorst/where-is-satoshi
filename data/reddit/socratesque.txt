Distinction high five!
I wouldn't hold my breath for that part 2 though, apparently it's been pushed up 4 times since originally offered in february 2013. 
Let's hope the bitcoin frenzy put a fire under Dan's ass, to finish up the course. (no disrespect to Dan, I'm sure it's a lot of work coming up with high quality content matching that of part 1)

No I get that, and I think it's great. I'm just saying that, for better or for worse, this doesn't make bitcoin any more anonymous from the governments perspective. Or rather, from anyone able to connect transactions to personal identities.

So what you're saying is that we need to decentralize our mining coordination..

The sad thing that coledaman is hinting at is that the general population don't give two shits about those things. I have no idea if this thing could be an actual threat, I don't even care to speculate on it. In a perfect world though, it certainly wouldn't be.
@_date: 2014-04-06 18:30:07
That's just not true. Anyone with the abilities to connect addresses to personal identities can see exactly where I send my coins. If one of those addresses later happen to belong to someone else, then it's clear money has in one way or another moved from my hand to that hand. If you somehow think this is not the case for stealth addresses, go ahead and try to explain that position.

I don't think Ripple Labs has ever advocated the idea that ripples are money though. That's why they don't encourage people to trade them. You only need to have 75 XRP (something like 0.4 USD) to create a ripple wallet, and then some miniscule amount to pay for transaction fees.
Ripple is actually beautifully brilliant, just like bitcoin, if you only remove your preconception of it and view it for what it is. And it's not an altcoin. If you enjoyed having your mind blown by digging into bitcoin, I strongly urge you to look into Ripple as well, if only for the fun of it.

I think Kraken is doing a great job and they're by far my favourite, but no downtime? They've had plenty. Especially around crashes, you can pretty much expect the site to become unavailable. This is most likely the fault of CloudFlare though, which I feel they shouldn't be using anyway. But I have a personal grudge against them, so maybe don't take my judgement on that as an objective one.. Anyway this could also explain our differing perceptions regarding Kraken's uptime.
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:53:34
Don't get me wrong, I don't give a damn about karma, but this right here shows how messed up the community has become. I'm merely asking you to have an open mind, to read up on something and be objective about it, and look at the downvotes I get for it. This promotion of ignorance is sad indeed.
@_date: 2014-04-05 10:45:16
So in essence, it's simply the sender generating the address rather than the receiver, correct? Then correct me if I'm wrong, but for the authorities it's no more stealth than the good ol' way of transferring bitcoin.
Still very cool though.

I suppose bears aren't very nimble, and they may just be dumb enough to stand up against a raging bull.. question is if the first blow would be lethal. If the bear can just get close once, I think the bull would be done for.
@_date: 2014-05-21 14:00:36


I wonder this too. I think we've all seen the videos with fluctuating balances, which would suggest you DO hold bitcoin and ARE susceptible to volatility. On the other hand we got remarks like this.. Will they be a meta-bank from which you can easily withdraw/deposit bitcoin? Can you maybe choose which number to "lock"? I'd be very interested in hearing what sort of middle grounds people can think of, and how it would affect the bitcoin space as a whole. I just pray to Satoshi that they won't roll out some payment solution to merchants and keep "bitcoin" transactions off-chain and centralized.
@_date: 2014-05-05 18:36:19
Fair enough.
@_date: 2014-05-13 09:41:03
+1 for the "it does math" part
Assuming I'm the only one in possesion of my keys, and the same is true for all other dark wallet users, the 10 of us in group A have to send our bitcoin to somewhere fom which this group transaction can take place, no? Then what assurances do I have that my bitcoins are properly forwarded?
@_date: 2014-04-08 08:35:47
Excuse my ignorance, I haven't paid much attention to the politics around bitcoin in a while. In what way exactly do they suggest that bitcoin should be regulated, that you deem to be excessive?

Trezor seems amazing, it's a much needed addition to the bitcoin echosystem!
I'm calling it now, big news of May; Trezor generating deterministic addresses, founders stealing customer's coins.

You're not hearing me right. I'm not contesting any of how the sender would generate a unique address that only the recipient can spend. I'm telling you that when the recipient does spend it, information about him or who else paid him may leak.
@_date: 2014-04-22 07:18:55
A joke can't go by on this board without someone having to point out how "we have to be able to laugh at our selves", and I just can't shake the feeling that they're saying it with the most forced grin on their face while grinding their teeth.

So this is good news?

What if instead of publishing his one adress, he would automatically generate a new one for each payment? Then wouldn't that have the exact same effect as having the payer generate an adress from the published seed adress?
I was however thinking more of what happens after these transactions have taken place. Let's say you're the publisher and I want to buy your book, and we're both using Kraken to get our money in and out of the network. I withdraw money to adress A, government know A is mine. I pay the adress B which I generate using your seed adress, the money are still in my possession as far as government knows. You now deposit from adress B to Kraken, boom they know the money's yours.
In this simple example it's easy to say I paid you, but sprinkle in a few more transactions in there and maybe there were other holders in between. This is rather unimportant for my argument though, as they wouldn't know the transaction was for the book, and I claim this is true no matter if I generated the unique adress or you did.
Of course part of this argument falls apart when you consider an eavesdropper that listens to all traffic going out from the publisher's channel of distribution. That is iff said traffic is unencrypted or decryptable by this man in the middle listening in in the first place.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that this doesn't make the receiver anonymous, and in the end it doesn't hide the fact that bitcoin moved from person A to person B, possibly via C, D and E. All it does is hide the history of an adress by splitting it up into many adressess, and to some extent help hiding the context of a transfer. (this I didn't consider before) All in all a great thing, but people might be disappointed if they look to stealth adressess as giving absolute anonymity.
Edit: sorry if my assertive statements are off putting, clearly you should know more about this than I do. I'm just spinning here and I'd appreciate it very much if you would show me where exactly I'm wrong. (unless we're actually on the same page now)
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:09:32
You may have been joking, but really, this doesn't exactly instil confidence. Just look at all that trash spread all over the repo. I'd be truly embarrassed.
I know blockchain.info is a bit of a holy cow around here, especially since Andreas joined, but this is just one in a line of recent fuckups on their side. Not gox sized fuckups, but fuckups none the less.

I don't think you need to specify this. If there's an ad here for anything, anywhere at all, it's with Rola.

What if all your addresses come from a deterministic wallet, can QC help find the seed from one or more of the key pairs?
@_date: 2015-11-30 18:56:00
Please bear with me as I throw some stupid questions in your general direction.
Can there realistically be a long lasting actual fork of the bitcoin blockchain? If not, if "there can be only one", does it matter whether your exchange supports this or that? In the end, they must follow suit. And at that, does a lazy bitcoiner with all his assets in an exchange need to care about any of this at all?
I tried visualising a fork and it seems to me like something highly unlikely to happen, but please correct me if I'm wrong. At least in the beginning, both sides will be on the same network, starting on the same blockchain. At some point some fraction will flip a switch and say the blockchain should look a certain way and the rest says it should remain the way it's always been. If either side is a small minority, they will essentially be shunned out of the network as their messages won't be propagated and they'll have a hard time finding their true peers. If the battle is somewhat 50/50, I suppose it's theoretically possible for the two chains to coexist on the one network? Although it would be a tremendous waste of resources.. But how long could that last? Surely one side would soon persuade the other and the minority would again be shunned out. Their only real option is to split out into a separate network all together. Is that possible? Is it trivial? Is it at all likely to happen? If no, then again, can't even the lazy bitcoiner with all his assets on the exchange just lean back and wait for the storm to pass?
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:30:57
Is that true? Maybe if they stayed on the same network, (which I suggest they can't) but if they split network then btc-1 and btc-2 would essentially be "altcoins", so you could have some miners keeping on with btc-1/2 just like litecoin has miners.
Regardless, I'm hypothesising that even when taking the price out of the equation, it's highly unlikely for two chains to coexist on the same network. If so, the question becomes how likely it is for the chains to split out into separate networks.
@_date: 2015-03-26 08:59:07
I'm sorry, could you quote the part about proposing different solutions? I'm not finding it.
@_date: 2015-03-26 10:55:17
I don't think that suggests at all that they have even been in contact with skatteverket, and much less had any alternative solutions rejected. To me it reads more like: We'll co-operate if you twist our arm, but we're going to kick this thing off by screaming to the press.
@_date: 2015-03-26 08:47:11
Based on the information in this article and on DN.se, this seems poorly handled by BTCX. I don't know much about law, but I bet skatteverket (the swedish tax agency) is well within their legal rights, like it or not, to ask about fiat trades and transactions. BTCX is being either dishonest or just ignorant about the implications of turning over such data. No doubt can they obfuscate the IDs and bitcoin address information so that skatteverket is unable to chart their users. Of course that would take time and effort, but that's exactly why the professional thing to do would have been to sort out their differences with skatteverket rather than flat out rejecting and running to court.
..on the more idealistic hand, I'm happy they're "sticking it to the man" in a question like this, so.. I'll shut up now.
@_date: 2016-07-30 00:30:55
I'd like to know as well.
Afaik this all started with ETC, and people being able to attain both ETH and ETC when requesting Coinbase to withdraw just ETH I think. That way people could sort of get "free money." However, if Coinbase just choose to never recognise ETC, aren't they safe? They still have full reserves (presumably) of the currencies they're working with. Sure they fucked up where they could have made a profit, but they didn't really loose anything, did they?
Sorry if I'm being dense here, please correct me where I'm wrong.
