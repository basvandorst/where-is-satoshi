This is the first I've heard of this.

You could pick from this list:  aggressive, compelling, achievable, or clear.

I just can't get over the fact that a "store of value" can be absent of value other than being a function of a store of value.  At least gold, a more realistic example of a store of value, has a value for things other than being called a store of value!  It can be used in jewelry and coinage and dentistry.  I think we were a lot better off when bitcoin wasn't lauded as a SoV but rather as a viable virtual currency.

Can you explain more about the e-transfer through VOPAY?  Or show me a link?  I used Quadriga frequently more than a year ago.  Decided to sit for a while and watch the markets, now approaching twelve months since I've bought anything (although I luckily sold 20% in late December, and had no problems getting the money from Quadriga).  Anyway, I'm at the point now where I'm going to start investing again by mid-October.  I assume that I can't fund through my debit card anymore (read threads about that months ago), so I guess it's time to start doing some research on the best way to fund again.  I had assumed I'd look into a wire transfer to Quadriga, but do you think this is better?  And what are the daily limits, etc.?  Thanks in advance for sharing this ...

If it's 2140, and my grandchildren's grandchildren are reading Reddit, I have so many questions to ask.  What is the average lifespan?  What is the average time between generations?  Why do we still need money?  Does the internet still exist?  Why haven't we come up with a better calendar?
