Whats this? Shibes?

Why don't you look at it the other way and ask yourself: "Do I want a phone with a battery life of 30 days and also be able to use this device to pay/receive bitcoins with?
I think this is a great idea.

Is this the time to buy?
@_date: 2015-09-16 07:32:21
I understand.
It's just that I started thinking about it because of the following article: 
@_date: 2015-09-11 05:44:23
Well if someone can hear my voice, our company is not doing great and maybe Bitcoin can open new doors for TNT. Is there anyone here that can provide me with a case on why Bitcoin may be the next big thing that our company can 'save' our company?
@_date: 2015-09-10 07:49:38
I work @ TNT Express and I've been suggesting looking into Bitcoin. But what am I in such a big company....

Well, at the moment I don't have that much money I can afford to lose. Is it also possible to invest smaller amounts of money? Like buying 1 BTC every month or so.
@_date: 2013-09-16 18:17:29
Nice one!
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:17:51
How about Europe?
@_date: 2013-07-30 09:18:44
What kind of BTC investments do you recommend?
@_date: 2013-07-30 09:57:57
Doesn't look like I can do this without doing any homework. Got some links regarding information on this subject?
@_date: 2013-11-01 08:58:16
Is it because of the smaller userbase?
@_date: 2013-07-30 13:53:55
Thank you very much for this information :)
@_date: 2013-08-07 06:04:11
Hey, this is a great idea! Good for those kids :)
@_date: 2013-11-01 08:37:52
Yes he should. Windows Phone 7.8 has a lot of users... I think :/
@_date: 2013-11-01 09:12:53


I fully understand. I wish I could help but I lack the skills, unfortunately.
I wish you all the best with the current application :)
(I really need an update to a WP8 device :D)
@_date: 2013-08-13 07:49:38
I just bought 2 of them.
Edit: 4

@_date: 2013-10-17 11:13:44
The question you should ask yourself; why shoudn't I accept Bitcoins?
What is there to lose?
@_date: 2013-08-22 10:46:10
I like this, BUT what if they hack this?
@_date: 2013-09-19 08:28:08
I would buy it :)
@_date: 2013-11-22 07:31:56
I agree :)
@_date: 2013-08-14 06:06:23
Nice, I'll check it out :)
@_date: 2013-07-23 14:17:23
I bought some silver from Coinabul about 1,5 month ago and I received it. No experience with BTC Shop.

What is the safest way to store/backup my btc?
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:46:26
I only have 0.9 btc, but I do not spend it. I did spend some on buying organic tea, but now I'm saving my btc.
//edit: If I could spend it on regular things as fresh ingredients, furniture, etc I would spend it &amp; buy some btc instead of mining it. 
Also I would buy a new smartphone to have a wallet on there.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:05:57
Could you explain why exactly?
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:39:52
In a few weeks pizza.be, one of the biggest online food order websites will integrate bitcoins :D
@_date: 2013-11-01 08:41:42
Is this already available for WP7.x
