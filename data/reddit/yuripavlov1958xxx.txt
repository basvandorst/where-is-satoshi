Btc has slumped the last 2 weekends if I remember correctly.
@_date: 2019-07-12 14:04:40
Not even on coinbase? How many attempts at a hack must they have had and yet no bad news yet.
@_date: 2019-07-10 14:36:07
So Chairman Powell just said Facebook Libra will be closely monitored due to risks... Btc is already established and mature. If it's crypto then there's only one solution.
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:18:28
13800 to 9200... It's had enough rest already.
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:16:53
See... I told you guys back at 11400 that there were people that bought at 13k and if you buy then you would have got more roi than the 13k buyers who are now less stressed and break even. For the newbies if you buy now then your roi will be higher than those that bought at 15k :)
Just buy and don't check the price every day.
@_date: 2019-07-02 05:02:40
10k support broken so now will go down to 8k area before shooting up near ath. Most of the chart and technical analysts said this would happen... Just go on YouTube and do your own research. Am buying more actual coins on the dips but also been betting on the price dropping v usd. It's a win win. You should do the same. Thank me later :)
@_date: 2019-07-21 08:01:44
It depends what day you bought it on and if you are right or left handed.
@_date: 2019-07-17 15:27:26
No need. Back in profit now for the day! That's the beauty of margin trading btc... One minute you are destitute and the next minute you can afford a Big Mac.
@_date: 2019-07-16 02:34:43
Based on nothing whatsoever... I think there'll be one more drop to about 8800 then we go up to 20k and more.
@_date: 2019-07-03 04:53:07
10k area was a good time to load up again. The trend is up now and no large dump red candles unlike before. If you are new and thinking should you wait until the price drops... Dont forget there were people buying at 13k and they are holding for future upside... So if you buy now you will be making more percentage than they will :)
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:27:16
If it was any other President then maybe (even Nixon) ... But not this one. I bet you a million dollars the price will now go up.
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:10:24
I am buying the dips and holding long term but also trading the price on my margin account. Bought at 10 to go up then at 9500 then at 9200... Going to use up all my margin and get a call if btc doesn't get itself in order!
@_date: 2019-07-07 05:23:57
There are also much better vices :)
Happy birthday, have a great day.
@_date: 2019-07-02 07:37:07
If you had millions worth you would probably keep the keys in cold storage and write them down in a notebook to prove they were yours? You'd take them offline from coinbase. But yeah, not sure if they would give you your initial fiat deposits back or the value of your btc when they got lost.
@_date: 2019-07-05 20:33:50
It was a proper pay day last week, for both that are paid monthly and weekly and yet it tanked 30 per cent! You can't predict btc.
@_date: 2019-07-17 16:23:02
MMCrypto latest video suggests a bottom at 8500 before going back up. Some maya multiple indicator that's been correct 11x before.
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:11:07
Come on bitcoin... wtf is wrong with you!
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:42:40
If you are a United States resident, your **Coinbase** USD Wallet is covered by FDIC **insurance**, up to a maximum of $250,000. 
That's what they say. I guess it covers both hacking and if the company goes bankrupt.
@_date: 2019-07-02 05:43:16
For the non-technical layman it's the easiest one to buy and store btc, and those on YouTube are mostly talking to this audience. And they are insured for losses.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:23:54
Orange haired racist pussy grabbing old school money bankrupt several times dude says bitcoin is not real money lol. If that's not a buy signal then I don't know what is.
Bitcoin to 40k now is more certain than ever.
@_date: 2019-07-26 16:17:53
Yeah because btc is a more stable and less volatile currency than what's causing the global instabilities! Lol.
@_date: 2019-07-01 17:56:01
All you had to do was to hold it until the end of year then you could have had a luxury life for 6 months!
@_date: 2019-07-12 14:06:28
It's that fuckwit Donald Trump... I'm surprised the price didn't double!
@_date: 2019-08-11 07:41:33
If he bought the car then he clearly hodled until such a point he could afford to buy the car, there's no hodl forever ... It's H-O-D-L... Not H-O-D-L-F
@_date: 2019-08-01 05:21:44
But with Microsoft you know who's going to change the code, Microsoft will. With BTC who's going to change the code?
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:38:53
Sorry to hear that man. I've been in very dark places financially... Very very dark places emotionally ... But life is a circle and it gets better eventually. Good luck!
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:26:04
It's red for the week on my chart... Unless it finishes tonight above 12600 it will be a red week.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:08:24
Yeah it's weird... I had to search to find it.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:55:34
13400 now... Hodor until 25k? :)
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:15:29
It's as if everyone has take profit automatically set to 12k! As soon as it reaches that then it's a red candle within a nano second, and it's been happening all day.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:00:22
Nearly 13500 now and 1am here in Asia. Should I stay or should I sleep now? If I sleep there will be trouble... If I stay will btc double? So come on and let me know...
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:15:16
Maybe he bought back in at 10,300?
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:42:24
There's the halvening next year so no, impossible it won't recover for years. Definitely more chance that it will break an all time high.
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:11:24
Having said that... 13 seems to be a tough resistance to break. But we all know resistance is futile.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:54:48
Just use a stock/cfd trading program and bet on the price. You don't have to own btc.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:31:48
It went under 11k for a few minutes so I got more :)
Hodor until 50k.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:20:39
13k here we come...
What's the best resistance level?
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:58:00
Will be lucky to end near the fibonacci retrace of 11,800. We've been 11700 to 12k all day but it looks like that's broken down now.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:34:35
Nearly 13700 now :) will go sleep when it hits 14k.
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:43:48
And this guy is too positive....!
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:56:15
So it could be:
Yes! In at 10400! Result.
Fuck now back to 12300 wish I bought at 11000!
Which one it is no one knows, that's the beauty of btc.
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:06:36
Testing 11,800 now....
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:03:50
Broke 12k now... The 25 per cent correction from the high already happened so now it's clear space until 15k. Hodor until end of year 40k ;)
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:26:22
As well as hodling I'm also betting on the price! It's a bit like playing blackjack at the casino... Absolutely unpredictable. But fun!
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:04:57
Well that's all the gains since Saturday erased then! Easy come easy go.
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:07:55
Will we hold over 10k is the big question now.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:00:27
And that's the retracement as predicted by everyone with a brain. Now the road is clear to 15k :)
For those newbies who are thinking wtf... BYND (Beyond Meat) has gone up by 175 per cent this year, and its not even real meat. Bitcoin is a real digital currency so if a shitty product like BYND can go up 175 per cent in months, imagine what BTC could do? 500 per cent this year is not out of the question. Hodor until at least 20k.
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:57:48
Just not holding 12k for some reason.
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:36:12
It looks likely... But it's retracted 3 times now from the 13k's and above in the last 10 hours... We need to hold steady above 13,500 then should go to 15 and 16 next week. But this is btc so fxxx knows!
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:14:42
Consolidation should be sideways! Not 10 per cent down in the day.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:15:23
Go do some research. Heard of Google? Want me to spell it for you? It's G-o-o-g-l-e
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:19:45
Stabilised at 11,600 now. Needs to hold until people wake up on the East Coast.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:37:00
12k now. When should we take profit? :-)
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:19:22
Back to 13k...
Shouldn't be another retracement until 15k.
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:16:32
And that's 12k again... Let's see if it holds this time.
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:58:25
Gained back 300 already.
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:42:50
The lowest candle wick went down to 11,205 at 03:15 EST.
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:22:54
Stabilising around 11800...and it's the last Friday of the month which means it's payday... Both Hodlers and Fomos will be buying this weekend so no guessing what the price will go up to. Good luck everyone :)
