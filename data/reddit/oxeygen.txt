Right, like Coinjar, which is currently in the store?
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:58:27
Why? 
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:34:19
Oh man, it seems like you are the one who's butthurt and misinformed here. !!!
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:51:41
Apple isn't very trendy on reddit either though :P 
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:47:11
That feel, I know it.
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:34:54
Fun fact: there are already bitcoin wallet apps in the App store. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:43:12
Buying something on eBay is 99% of the time a physical object. Coinbase wanted to sell virtual objects, they need to be sold trough Apples in app purchase method. It's their rules.
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:57:54
No. Not because of the limitations, because that people in the apple app store actually want to pay money for apps, which is kind of important for developers. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:43:04
Hah :') Bye money, already lost 100 euro on a 200 euro purchase
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:33:59
Only rumors = base on thin air.
The iPhone 5s was supposed to be curved, just saying. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:33:30
No, they just like to circlejerk.
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:12:20
Me too, at 500eur/btc (around 670usd). Just looked at the 2y charts and my heart sank a little. 
Edit; it seems to stable out now, luckily
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:00:39


That's the point. They don't have an anti-bitcoin policy. 


Which is not true again. 


Like iOS, right? 


Apple doesn't.


You can. 


You could if you weren't so ignorant. 
I highly doubt that you even did 10 seconds of research on your long, but completely untrue, comment. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 10:20:39
Yeah, because, in your words: "it is against Apples guidelines (Apple forbids it) to publish Bitcoin transaction apps in their marketplace. Good we agree." I have yet to see a Bitcoin app being published in which you can't buy Bitcoins, which is the part that isn't allowed. 
Is it that hard?
Also, I did address what you said.
@_date: 2013-12-14 12:46:39
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:11:14
Because you did 0 research. 


And that's exactly why. 


Like what apps? Coinbase and Gliph were removed because it *violated their rules*. 


No idea, but this one has been in the store for more then 2 years.  
Is Apple still so anti bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:42:47
That's pretty ignorant. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:46:33
I'm not in australia, could be true! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:17:35
Damn. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:25:52


What lack of support? Lack of support for apps that *break their rules*? 
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:34:32
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:32:13
Or "CoinJar", a native wallet app.
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:26:39
That's the whole point. Apple is not anti bitcoin, it's anti apps-that-break-their-rules. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:49:43


Those rules aren't anti bitcoin. By that logic those rules are also anti dollar, anti euro, anti yen, etc etc etc. I fully agree that the rules should be changed, however saying that Apple is anti bitcoin is just wrong. 


That's not true. Those rules are made to protect their customers, which they treat like they are children. The downside of the play store, because of their rules (or lack there of) is that viruses and malware are more prevalent. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 13:54:06
They don't have an official stance on bitcoin apps. The bitcoin apps which got rejected violated their rules (implementing their own purchase flow for non physical objects). A stand sells physical objects and are in the clear. (Just like why the eBay app can implement their own purchase flow etc.)
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:24:37
Apple would allow Coinbase, if they didn't implement their own payment flow. (See Coinjar, has been in the store for 1+ month without problems) People in this subreddit take the rejection of Coinbase as Apple being anti-bitcoin, which is just not true. That's my point, I don't  give 2 shits who uses which device. I'm only being defensive against people who lie. 
[FWIW: I didn't downvote you. ] (
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:35:58
Altough I doubt that they will steal bitcoins, this is a valid concern. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:38:42
Yeah I know but  my point is that saying Apple is anti bitcoin is just straight bullshit.
I won't even go into the ignorant second half of your comment. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:37:56
Just because you can't buy bitcoins in a native app....?
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:23:45
Psst, don't break the circlejerk.
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:29:02
That about sums up this subreddit indeed. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:20:17
Right, then make that argument and not that apple is anti-bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:01:47
So in about 10 months it will be 10.000
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:23:05
Yeah, don't try to bring facts in here, apparently Bitcoin people just like to circlejerk how bad Apple is while they have 0 valid arguments against Apple. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:56:39
That app is rejected for violating the rules I pointed out. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:19:14
Yeah but Apple removed it from the store. If you have installed it before it stays on your phone
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:48:47
You are just an idiot: 
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:42:39

... and wallets like coinjar. hurdurdur apple bitcoin nazis hur dur
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:40:27
Ok, if you know everything so well, please give me an example of a Bitcoin app that has been rejected by Apple that didn't violate their rules like I pointed out. 
Also, I don't have to convince or cirlejerk about Apple to know that these arguments are just complete bullshit. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 10:01:15
Man you are so edgy. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:57:56
I KNOW the rules are the problem, that is not my point. Not at all. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:04:10
No. A wallet app in which you can't buy bitcoins. Just transfer and request them. Is it really that hard to understand? 
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:46:33




Haha,  
The Coinbase app was rejected because it implemented it's own bitcoin buy flow, and since bitcoin are non physical objects, those purchases have to be done trough Apple's in app purchase flow. Coinbase broke Apple's rules and is now crying.
Again, so much misinformation. Please go educate yourself on this topic before making false claims. 
 
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:32:14
You can transfer bitcoins, so yes. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:43:43
Nope, haven't researched the app myself. I found that review too, but that's the only bad thing I've read about them. The overall app ratings is 4 stars, I doubt that they steal
@_date: 2013-12-10 10:25:16
LOL so, by your logic, Tesla doesn't take a risk making their new cars, just because electric cars were around in 1930? When I drive my car I don't take risks because millions of people have driven cars before? Fuck logic.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:04:12
Ugh. Of course that's not a good idea but with the current guidelines it's not possible what Coinbase wants. Shitty for Coinbase but that's the rules of Apples App Store. Thus I'm an idiot for telling you Apple's guidelines. Flawless logic, fucktard.
And of course you only respond to that, not anything about me proving you wrong. 
At the end of the day, you are an ignorant, uninformed, idiot. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:39:16
No. Coinjar is a perfect example of Apple allowing bitcoin wallets in the app store 
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:22:03




Nice, do you also base all your opinions on world politics trough Fox News? If you had read op to it just a bit more, you would know that coin base for example got rejected for not complying with apples rules. (implementing their own way around in app purchases) Apple sux, le right? 
@_date: 2013-12-10 10:07:34
It's not so much the holding money part, they have their own passbook app in which you can hold creditcards and there are enough apps in the store in which you can manage a bank account. I think it's more that they block apps which implement their own in app purchase flow for buying virtual objects. (Which is not allowed within their guidelines) That's why Coinbase got blocked but ebay for example is allowed. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:42:04
Fact: You have no idea what you are talking about. Coinbase got rejected because it went against Apples guidelines, an app can not implement it's own payment method for virtual objects. Easy. 
Fact: You didn't look in the app store for bitcoin apps, [there are a lot in there]( 
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:33:02
No. Coinjar.
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:49:12
This is so great! Let's pay with currency, made to be anonymous, to deliver food, right to your doorstep :D
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:23:33
Also, marketshare is cool and all but as a developer iOS is way more interesting. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:20:52
You believe rumors? Cute.
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:08:30
I really don't get this Apple being anti bitcoin stuff. There are enough bitcoin apps in the app store, Coinjar as a wallet, Coinbits as a ticker. Sure Apple denied Coinbase's app but that was simply because it violated Apples guidelines.... Same for Gliph. An app is not allowed to implement their own purchase flow for non physical transactions, simple rules, simple stuff, hard consequences. 
Edit; Oh sorry guys! I forgot I'm supposed to join the cirlejerk of misunderstanding and misinformation.
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:32:15


Damn you are so dumb. No that's a ticker. If you want to send and receive bitcoins you have download a wallet app, like Coinjar. Does your mom still make your lunch?
@_date: 2013-12-10 10:32:48
100% agree
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:24:17
.2 is still 100 euro though. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:32:30
Or "CoinJar", a native wallet app.
@_date: 2013-12-10 10:44:27
I never said anything about visionary. So basically what you just said is that Apple did take risks. Ok thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:36:48
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:06:12
Yes I do understand it, it's just that the arguments that they bring to the table and the claims they make (Apple is anti bitcoin) are just plain wrong. 
Currently? No, because I don't use android on a daily basis. However, this app was a hit:  Great policy. 
Again, I don't give a crap who uses which device, their arguments are just invalid and bullshit. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:15:11
Yeah because Gliph violated Apple's rules. I mean, it's Apple's rules that an app can't implement it's own payment flow for non physical transactions, pretty easy stuff...
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:33:14


It does, because that's my point. They are just as anti dollar as they are anti bitcoin. If that policy is a good one is not my point either. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:42:12
Just checked it, you can't. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:45:39
Haha, by that logic their rules are anti dollar, anti euro, anti yen, etc etc etc. 
Fully functional bitcoin apps aren't being banned, example: coinjar, coinbits. Only apps that violate their rules are being banned. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:31:47
Oh and BTW, there ARE wallet apps. Download "CoinJar" it's an wallet. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:47:48
Making valid arguments backed by sources, "full retard"
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:13:55
Implementing their own payment flow. Purchases of non physical objects need to go trough Apple's in app purchase framework
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:22:41




That's not true. Apple bans bitcoin apps which break their rules. There are more then enough bitcoin apps in the store, including wallets.

Bullshit, they already do.  
 


Last year the rumor sites said that there would be a curved iPhone by now, is there a curved iPhone? It seems *very* unlikely to me that they will make their own payment alternatives.
Misinformation all around. If you go around making claims, atleast fact check them. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 13:34:56
I refuse to sign up for one simple article but from what I read so far, what is his point exactly? Retailers can implement their own purchase flow all they want - including bitcoins.
Seems like just an other clickbait article to me.

Why didn't you just download an bitcoin app? Coinjar, as a wallet, Coinbits as a tracker with push notifications. What else do you need?

@_date: 2013-12-14 17:26:32
If you plan on selling physical objects you are fine.
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:40:49


I'm a developer too, if you just keep to your rules (which aren't all that restrictive at all) 
IMO the Apple app store is way more lucrative for developers since it's users are way more inclined to buy stuff (and advertisement don't bring in nearly as much, unless you have a few million users, which is hard to accomplish) 
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:19:31
Don't break the circlejerk.... 90% of the nay sayers here have 0 experience with Apple and just base their opinion on what they read on the internet (which never really is positive)
