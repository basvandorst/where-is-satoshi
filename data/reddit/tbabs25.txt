Well that is not true. Even if there is a dispute on a trade and you intend to ban the seller..the best thing to do is to allow him withdraw his coin why the dispute goes on..I have a a friend who was ban just a on a basis been reported that he engage in outside trading it is unfair to Do this..paxful ban the seller and they did not allow him to withdraw his coin...the seller has 0.5 btc in his wallet this cheating.

Please be realistic trading outside paxful is that enough reason why the seller btc will be seized ...two wrong doesnt make a right..this is stealing...this is daylight robbery..he should have been ban and allow to withdraw his coin

Paxful is the worst you could be ban and they will not allow allow you to withdraw your coin..but LBC is still better if they ban you on LBC they still allow you to withdraw your fund....if you are trading on paxful you could loose your fund if you are ban...
