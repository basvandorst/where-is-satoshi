I have a lot of respect for Andreas,  Great speaker and cryptocurrency thought leader.  I also think Anthony Watson is a very talented CEO.  He shares way more than other start-up CEOs in the space. I see that he weighed in on this thread.  In my world (marketing for start-ups) we build brands.  In my opinion, Uphold is a far better brand name than Bitreserve.  I don't know for sure.  but I would assume that Uphold will not make defending the trademark on a previous brand name much of a priority.  A valid trademark always trumps a domain name.  So anyone who thinks they have a great domain name should spend the $400 to apply for a trademark.  You can do it online.  Slogans or taglines, same thing.  Patents and trademarks are a rough and tumble business.  Many people do not know the Alexander Graham Bell won a patent on the telephone because of one vote in the Supreme Court.   A ton of people testified that Daniel Drawbaugh had demonstrated voice over wire years before.  I guess Drawbaugh wasn't very keen on defending his brand.

A trademark trumps a domain name.  That is the law.  If you have a valuable domain name, you should spend the $400 it costs to trademark it.  You can do it online:   But you should also realize that a trademark is only as good as your willingness to defend it.  Being smart in managing trademarks, domain names and brands does not make you a bully.  It is a routine part of managing a business start-up.
