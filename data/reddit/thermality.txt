Zhenya Tsvetnenko is a scammer. He has the moral backbone of a leech, and is just as parasitic.
There are plenty of articles just a Google search away detailing the many scam sites he has operated in the past and the many unwitting victims he has ripped off. This scumbag has very skewed business ethics and made his entire ill-gotten fortune by misleading and deceiving his "customers" who thought they were signing up to a free service, but then ended up being billed excessively.
Illegal? Most definitely. In fact, there was a class-action lawsuit in the US brought against him and another equally morally bankrupt business some years ago.
He doesn't care at all about customers or other people, only about his own self-interests and the potential for making himself more profit, no matter what the moral cost.

I have actually already read that. Have you?
Fractional reserve lending is not possible with bitcoins. Think about it, you can't lend bitcoins you don't have. The type of fractional reserve lending they propose at that URL would be different from bitcoin altogether and would essentially be creating new debt instruments at banks that support it.

And what about those that wish to use a Bitcoin client and manage their own wallet?
@_date: 2012-09-04 12:05:19
They won't be able to use fractional reserve lending with Bitcoin, but that's probably a good thing.

Wouldn't that also mean that as you proceed to buy bitcoins your subsequent purchases will cost more and more as you push the price up as you attempt to purchase $1m worth?

Ah, looks like this is already being discussed over at

If you're serious about selling your botnet, you should post a tormail email address.

Didn't they effectively merge under the PayPal brand?

Depends on when you enter and exit during the cycles.

I can't believe you actually used cash as a comparison in your response. I was almost going to explicitly exclude cash in my previous reply because of how different it is but I underestimated your ignorance.
Please read up more on how Bitcoin and other digital crypto-currencies work to better inform yourself.

A big difference is that you have the OPTION of withdrawing digital coins to your own self-managed wallet to  completely take control of your own finances.

What happens when you go to buy Product X at Merchant Y with bitcoins? Merchant Y will still be expecting to receive full payment in bitcoins.
Wouldn't there need to be a whole new layer created above the Bitcoin system to support Fraction Reserve Banking, that all the merchants would then also need to support?
So long as the merchants require payment in BTC using the Bitcoin protocol, and don't release the product/service until it's received, how would FSB ever work with Bitcoin?

Maybe that kind of behaviour is more accepted in the US. It's sort of part of the culture.

This could include both.

Don't bring Jesus into this! ;-D
Some differences between cash and a crypto-currency: 
* Cash or a promissory note can't be transferred digitally over a network.
* Cash can't be encrypted or backed-up and once found it can be seized or stolen. A Bitcoin wallet can be protected using encryption and multiple backup locations with the key stored in the user's mind. If the key is strong enough, short of physical coercion it is very well protected and cannot be stolen or seized.
* The amount of currency in circulation for which most promissory notes represent units of is unfixed and dilutable ([which is currently happening with the US dollar](
