Hey, I am just trying to make sure that even if I can get a few people to avoid investing with them it'll make the whole thing fall apart quicker 
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:10:50
Well it becomes pretty cheap if you just buy from GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:11:59
Agreed 
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:52:22
Or is it the dip?

I mentioned it in the video and videos I have posted before top is in  if 5k support doesn't hold we are going back to 3k or even less. If 5k support holds in the next few days I'll be covering  my 7400 short and looking for a long entry

What's the difference between this and talking on a Bluetooth headset? I'm paying attention to the road, I appreciate your concerns about the safety of me and my family. I will definitely take this into account. EDIT; oh shit, Actually I just realized I had it in my hand not in the phone mount on my windshield.

If we don't go into a full bear market back to 3k then we can be back up top within a few weeks I agree. But a correction back is imminent 
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:54:31
Exactly you got it! 
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:24:01
