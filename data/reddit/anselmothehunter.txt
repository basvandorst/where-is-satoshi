I will be at the airport in two weeks - I will let you know how it goes.

Tell me about it - that parity has been killing me lately. Turkey is in for a rude awakening quite shortly I think. I will take a look at Vatan, but I think for the time being I will stick to purchasing cryptos as I don't think my apartment could handle the output of a rig. What are you doing in Istanbul? Student? 
@_date: 2014-04-08 16:28:08
Well, I am. That charity I was talking about ya dingus. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:34:39
I apologize for not being more clear. The funds are definitely gone. Whoever it was, they took what I had in Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Namecoin - sold the LTC and NMC down for Bitcoin, and moved them to some wallet that appears to be in France. The funds are gone, Kraken did confirm that. However, when I check the withdrawals, it reads as "sent" and not "success" as it normally would do once the money has been sent and confirmed. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:12:29
I am sorry for you man. I am happy I never ended up on Mt. Gox. Maybe you can try Kraken? I have also recently had my money stolen... So just be more careful than me and I think you will enjoy Kraken :D

American here living in Turkey. I am not happy with the Lira. (or the current political situation, will save that for another thread as I am sure you are all too aware :D)
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:50:16
Just noticed this as well. XBT trading the lowest I have seen in three months on Kraken. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 12:58:56
I love this exchange, happy to stay with them. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:53:56
This is all brilliant advice - and I will be doing all of this. Thank you for your detailed instructions. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:37:20
Well - I would assume they would discuss Auroracoin. Hopefully at least.
@_date: 2014-01-02 21:44:33
Meh - the guy has a firm grip... his close circle is corrupt as all get out, massive protests since the early summer - and he hasn't budged. Did you get a chance to see all of the new regulations that started today? I have felt for the longest time that many (at least in Istanbul) are living far beyond their means - pretty sure that is going to all coming crashing shortly here. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 09:04:27
Any ideas on when these will be fully released? I am spread over a few markets and needless to say I don't sleep well at night.
@_date: 2014-04-07 15:23:52
Looks that way.
@_date: 2014-04-11 10:53:14
That is fair enough. I should have probably added a few things here - I talked about it. A lot. So much so, she would tell me to stop and talk about something else. It took over a lot of "going out with friends" conversations because I was excited and researching like a mad man a few months back, so naturally I wanted to discuss it with someone else. That someone else turned into everyone else. Interest is split down the middle between my friends - they either love it, or hate it. One or two feigned interest out of respect, I think. 
With that said - she supports it - I am not an active day trader (I tried my hand and learned my lesson, not a whole lot loss though) and I am in for the long run - hell, I want this to work as a currency for multiple reasons. However, she asked me to lower the amount I put in each month, and I did do that this month. The next step is to really put it in cold storage and forget about it for a year.

Thanks for sharing. Maybe try posting again?

My bank account requires a pin, my account number, a password, and a one time password that is sent to my phone. Isn't that pretty secure? Or am I again being a dolt?

Well, I am fairly certain that there are some pretty rugged sanctions against North Korea from the West... so, uh, maybe their government would actually support BitCoin as it would allow them to get around some of those said [sanctions](

These fucking thieves need to be held responsible.

Don't worry - I am in the same boat. Fuck these people man, scum of the earth swindlers.

Was the visa process easy to get into DPRK? So far from my research, just seems a bit expensive.

So sorry - I should have clarified - I am not sure how a virus was able to be installed on my computer. I like 2FA via SMS - so I will set that up now. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 21:27:52
It may not mean much - but I have a friend that does a bit of programming in Tunis and I know for a fact that his (albeit small) group he works with knows quite a bit about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 11:03:16
Btw - how do you store your cryptos? I am thinking of taking mine offline. I don't have much in my koinim.com account - but I don't want to have them stolen either. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 04:22:25
Mark and Dan should be cellmates. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:33:09
Thanks for taking the time to explain that. I was unaware of how that malware exactly works. Beers for you in Istanbul should you ever make it out here. 
I lost 400Euros, and I am currently making Turkish Lira, so I consider that a hefty loss! What do you suggest the Bitcoin community does in order to stop this? 
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:42:06
Just once a month.
@_date: 2014-04-11 12:50:45


Then she is right to be concerned. Just kidding... Kind of.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:51:28
What is the next step for MTGOX? I am really curious - are they making a runner with the funds tied up there? I am sure Mr. Marky Mark is on one of the biggest coke binges in his life this fine Japanese afternoon.

Haha, maybe you misunderstood me - I want to donate, I don't want to use the services available.

I think the current logo is great for MtGox - a simple yet well constructed circle to imply that your money just goes in a roundabout and never leaves! 
@_date: 2014-04-08 16:23:39
Well, there goes your chance at a free tenner pal.
@_date: 2014-02-13 16:31:53
Great to hear. Have been trying to spread the word too; most people think I am nuts though. What kind of rigs do your friends have set up? Electronics are insanely expensive here. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 07:30:37
That was a great read, thanks for that. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 07:45:21
I have to agree with this - my humble opinion in regards to government is that it should be no where as big as it is in the United States (especially since they aren't providing some sort of a social healthcare nor free higher education system); but with that said, I do believe in small regulation - consumer protection and etc. which directly relates to BitCoin. I don't want this to be some sort of Wild West frontier on the internet, someone breaking the law needs to be held accountable. Plus, all of you holding out there, I believe a bit of government regulation would actually help your pocket. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:34:03
Another question - how would that malware make it on to my computer? I assume just from simply browsing the internet. What else can I do to protect myself?
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:29:39
Kraken is fantastic - I am sure more people will begin moving to them. They have answered every support ticket I have ever sent and they are always very helpful. I lost some money but it appears that malware may have effected my computer which unfortunately there is nothing they can do about it. Sucks. Beyond that, I am well pleased to have an account with them. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:54:11
Ok. Now I am worried about Kraken.
"Or, on a more personal note, that time I lost $50 from my Mt. Gox account, shortly before the above large hack occurred. Apparently that was "my own fault for getting my account compromised", even though I was using a random 20-character KeePass-generated password, several other people reported a similar account compromise, and none of my other accounts were compromised. To this day, Mt. Gox has failed to acknowledge their role in this compromise, and has failed to refund me."
I am not using Mt. Gox but something extremely similar happened to me. Kraken gave me vague answers, they don't want to refund me, and my other exchange account was not hit. Both were open at the same time. Fuck. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 21:39:12
Haha - says the person that has had an account for two hours. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 05:15:08
I will look into this option. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 16:20:59
I don't - I use İş Bankası but let me look and see if they offer something similar. Thanks for the advice - happy to see someone else in Turkey is into Bitcoin as well! 
@_date: 2014-02-27 09:02:32


I am standing by this too. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 14:22:19

@_date: 2014-04-02 18:25:22
That is true - the problem is that I hold various coins, and so far from what I can determine is that I need a printer that has never touched the internet. Seems a complicated measure but one I am going to take as I was once already a victim - not so keen on it again.

All three are better than "crypto" currency.
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:29:16
No, I will be honest. However, in more of my ignorance I mainly operate on my work computer and I am not able to download anything with out admin login, which of course I do not have. I assume that there are ways around that, well, apparently there are! The thing that bothers me, is that it has almost been 48 hours, and the transfer still reads as "Sent" on my end, it doesn't say "success" as it normally would. Maybe I am being pedantic here. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:20:40
Got a plan set in stone, sticking to it. If you're ever in İstanbul write me and I will buy us a few rounds. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 10:13:04
Incredible. Congratulations to you, and continue with the great work! 
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:24:32
No no - Kraken didn't completely dodge the issue. They answered me, I guess I just don't feel "satisfied" - it just seemed vague in my opinion. Hell, they answered me everywhere I wrote. I wasn't using randomized passwords, but it still wasn't some short password either. Not that it matters, I guess. It has been over two weeks since my funds have been stolen, and in my withdrawals it still reads as "sent" ... When I asked them about it, they said it was a bug that they were working to fix. This, coupled with the fact that my Turkish exchange was open as well, has me asking a few questions. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 14:59:43
Haha, come to Istanbul then, beers on me! We can chat about it all night at the local commie pub. I am not a communist, but I like to hang out at their locals.

Great news for Kraken, too. Congratulations all around.

I like your analogy - it works well. However, as someone that has been scouring the internet (probably not as much as I should) it is quite difficult to find articles in regards to cryptos and where they are taking us as it is still just that new. Any reader recommendations? Please post. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:42:50
Still not verified for any markets I have signed up for...and I am just sitting here watching all this exciting news twiddling my damn thumbs. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:32:20
At this time - are you mining any other coins? Can you provide a recommendation on which coins to mine? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:20:58
That is what makes this rather exciting - it is just too bad that I actually have to do work and can't sit and stare at these charts all day :/
@_date: 2013-12-13 07:40:15
I am currently living in Istanbul and waiting for a confirmation from MTGox - has been 10 days today. I will have another hurdle to cross once I am verified as I will have to use my İş Bankası account and that may not allow me to transfer money - I have SEPA (if I remember correctly) and IBAN capabilities but those take some time too.
