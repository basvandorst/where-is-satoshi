All aboard the hype train. I get it but eventually the hype train will run off a cliff.

Ripple is indeed entirely about digital fiat, but not because of the premine.
Their system is based on a money-as-debt principle. Every token that you pass around on their network (beside XRP) is literaly an IOU from another account. The worth of that token is directly tied to the trust you place into the account that created it.
Now XRP is supposed to merely be a bit of grease to facilitate transactions and limit spammy behaviors, and really shouldn't be something folks speculate on.
If Ripple is successful in its design, the overwhelming majority of the value transferred over its network will be through those IOU tokens, not XRP.

Having said that this guy probably has no clue how Ripple works like most speculators in the space. There isn't much of learning curve to learning how buy cryptocurrency but learning how it actually works is another story.

What city are you in?

I agree with you 100%. The problem is a combination of lack of education and greed. If people took the time to have an understanding how Bitcoin works then applied that basis of knowledge to understand the value propositions of other cryptocurrencies then we would not have the Ripple situation on our hands. People are going to lose a lot of money with on that one.

The idea the decentralization makes everything better is stupid. It is only useful for certain things.

It is but there are a lot of startup costs. You have to be a licensed money transmitter for one. The United States government takes its KYC and AML laws very seriously.

I have ATMs that I would like to place. I am not looking to go to physical ATMs that are already placed.
@_date: 2018-05-22 00:23:24
Yes, I have one and am fully compliant with all US regulations. Also, the Cheif Compliance Officer at my company is top notch.

Drawing water from all sources. Top developers ask for too much for rent and the locations are not worth it. Smaller businesses with good foot traffic and good hours are more affordable and yield a better ROI. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 00:18:23
Do you have a location that may be good in Washington or California?
@_date: 2015-05-05 20:29:14
Thanks for doing this. You are awesome!

Try Coinstar if you want to use cash. It's only a 4%
@_date: 2019-02-19 21:57:01
You trade coins for cash then you trade cash for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-12 01:39:34
But the spread is so large! I wish there was more liquidity.
@_date: 2019-04-12 03:35:26
I want to use it now though and not pay an 8% premium...

I am driving lyft with all my spare time to buy more until next havling. Got a few others to join me. Let me know if you want to be a HODL lyft driver - we can get that referal bonus. 
@_date: 2019-01-31 05:25:23
The cost of money transmitters licenses and cash logistics to provide that service is more than you would expect...

Where in Santa Monica is that?

I think p/e ratios will go down and there will be a lot less unprofitable companies taken public. Its good that we have a strong reliable store of value to compete with stocks.

If you have made 1000-2000% who cares paying 5-10% for the convenience of not dealing with a wire or bank account. Seems reasonable to me.

A physical point to convert crypto to cash is completely useless? How?
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:11:14
I think of Bitcoin as a universal saving account. You need to hold it at least a few years before spending.
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:00:48
Thanks for doing this sir
@_date: 2019-05-04 19:21:37
Because people don't want to invest a ton of money into buying the hardware just to have the government come and shut them down. How does that not make sense to you?
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:01:28
I will just be buying Bitcoin. You have fun with all that other "crypto" garbage, okay?
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:02:30
Ehhh they will understand in 2021 - 2022. You gotta change your thinking to be more low time preference from high time preference. The vacation can wait, cheap Bitcoin will not wait. Imagine how much more gratifying it will be to have that much more Bitcoin after halving in 2020? Think of it this way. The capital for those 2 big trips could be enough for 10 big trips or more in 3 years if you get Bitcoin instead.
@_date: 2018-12-26 05:38:11
Hey thank you man!

I can tell you to buy the pieces of paper with my face on it and say its the new dollar. Does not make it worth anything.

The longest chain of proof of work is what matters. You can copy the code but you can not copy all the work it took to get the chain where it is. Everyone can create a coin that's fine but the copies will be useless. The boom/bust cycles are part of Bitcoin and more will occur as it accumulates enough economic mass to be an alternative currency. You can continue to believe whatever you want to believe but only one of us will be saying "I told you so" a few years down the line.
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:08:11
Well thats good. At least you are doing as much as you can!
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:27:34
If the fork has the most hashing power then its no longer called a fork. It's the main chain.

This is amazing!

I am driving Lyft as a second job just to accumulate. Also postponing any travel plans next year to buy. Delayed gratification will pay off in this case!
