when we mine the last coin? 
Say we mine like crazy and unlock all the blocks before there is widespread adoption, why would people mine at tbat point? There wont be enough transaction fees to warrant the mining.

Hmm someone should make a model showing how fees will rise based on the number of people using btc. I cant math :p
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:40:21
Funny, that's close that what I've got.

On bathurts, north of bloor.
@_date: 2014-01-04 19:53:23
And what happens once its all mined up? And what if we mine everything before there are enough people using btc to warrant the profitability of fees.

They can choose a payout of bitcoin to a specific address each day, or a conversion at the current bitcoin market price. I'm trying to picture a scenario where it's mostly just bitcoin being used.

Same feeling bro!

wasn't the image made by someone here?
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:57:17
Thank you kind Sir. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 20:06:50
Ah okay got it. I was wondering about that difficulty factor auto adjusting itself. Thanks!

Its converted on the spot, so if he WAITS until the price drops, he looses. Otherwise, win win.

How do I set a threshold on my receiving address?
@_date: 2014-01-08 23:24:32
Yeah, that sounds like a scene out of a movie!
Another question: If a large company had a single QR/Payment address, people would easily be able to see how much money a specific company is making - including all it's employees etc. Even if they used several address, the main one needed to hold funds could be leaked and suddenly the entire company's financials are in the public eye. 
I'm not saying this is a bad thing because it promote integrity, but the current big-money isn't going to like how easy it is for people to pull payment data.

Ok, go turn yourself in.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:11:21
Cant say people wont try. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:21:19
No way to enforce it? Simple, shut you down it your accounting don't match. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:19:26
Just playing the devil's advocate here,  but that doesn't mean it can't change.

@_date: 2013-11-29 20:28:41
You assume they can't change the law.

OR, you keep the bitcoin in your wallet and when ever you need real cash, you use localbitcoins to find someone who is willing to buy a few at a time. This way you only have enough cash handy to live on and you get to keep the bulk of your wealth.

Ive noticed this attitude here a lot.  "Bitcoin or nothing,  fuck resonable discussions!" 
Everyone just resorts to petty insults.  Obviously we wont all have the same biews but please stop the pointless condecending replies. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:50:53
I tried saying this a couple weeks ago. Did not go well. Now that the price has plummeted and governments are kicking back, people's attitude have changed changed.
