If Tether collapses that probably means they minted hundreds of millions if not billions of tether to buy BTC. They would be dumping that BTC so fast for fiat you’d see blood on the streets literally.

I believe that's outlining calculating time when for example, you're told that "you must submit a response within 7 days" 
Seems like they are just saying 'days' = 'business days' But if there is a specific date, then it is a hard deadline.

The point simply was to also send out the invoice balance due in bitcoin instead of just the fiat currency equivalent so that you don’t get screwed by price fluctuations up.
For example, if you invoiced someone at $500 and bitcoin doubled in price by the time they pay, they would only send you half the bitcoin.

This is why Ethereum has plans to go proof of stake "virtual mining" instead of using actual hardware to mine. If I understand correctly, BTC will always be proof of work.

I wont tell you how to spend your money, but there are THREE VERY IMPORTANT  THINGS that you absolutely  must do.
1) Do not tell anyone. Don’t tell your friends, relatives or anyone else who doesn’t already know. No one needs to know.
2) Hire good advisors and tax experts that are also experts in dealing with crypto assets. Make sure you are able to access and secure your bitcoin immediately, whether its via cold storage or some kind of custodial service, your team will advise you on what you need to do.
3) Figure out  with your team if it makes sense to keep any of your wealth in Bitcoin. 
Though many of us here are big believers in bitcoin, the reality of the situation is that you have to protect your wealth at all costs. Bitcoin could lose most it’s value tomorrow due to market volatility, get banned by our government or severely taxed.
Someone cared enough about you to pass this wealth on to you.
Now its your responsibility to protect, secure, preserve and stabilize your wealth as soon as possible! If that means diversify then so be it.. better than having all your eggs in one basket. If you fail to plan, then your plan is to fail.
Hope that helps!

I get your question... Are you really buying bitcoin? Where do they store this bitcoin and where do they get it from?
Some people may not know that you can’t transfer or spend btc out of robinhood, you can only buy, sell or stare at it’s value.

Google’s quantum computer is too weak to be able to break bitcoin’s encryption. We are about 20-30 years away from something capable. 
However, they will come eventually and Bitcoin will easily switch to a quantum resistant algorithm before its possible. Even the Ethereum dev team are already planning to do this with Ethereum 3.0
But if for some reason there is a working quantum computer right now capable of breaking modern encryption , then the world has a bigger problem. bitcoins being hacked would be the least of anyone’s worries.

Its usually what the opposite of what everyone expects. So right now everyone expects a drop to a bottom of $1500-$2500 then skyrocket. So likely it will just skyrocket when no one expects it way outside of those ranges and everyone misses the bottom.

Bitcoin does over a billion a day in $USD trading vol, so you can for sure sell off quickly if you were motivated. But if you have 94 million dollars worth of bitcoin you would contact an OTC bitcoin broker that does big volume. Wealthy people don't use exchanges, you'd be account limited to around $500k a month at the most if u go exchange.  
Some exchanges you can contact directly to do OTC trades for large amounts.
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:23:34
That would be great for us. Lower supply and constant demand = higher value.
Also, 1 bitcoin is divisible by something like 99.9million(?) units 
@_date: 2017-09-02 04:35:04
When supply decreases and demand stays constant or increases, then the value increases.

If bitcoin hits that price that means BTC has entrenched itself into the United States economy (along with others). Thus will be backed by it’s military and money.
If part of people’s pensions and 401k is in bitcoin, China will not fuck with it. However, you have a good point, bitcoin can be killed before that happens.
