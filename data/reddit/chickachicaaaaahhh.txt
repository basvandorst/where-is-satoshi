Damn tron.... damn

I cant tell you one big thing about this and its that alt coins are going to blow the fuck up if btc start dropping price. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:32:50
Still rather not let that happen...
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:33:57
Who has the most? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:26:13
Lmao what... most poor people are smarter than the average rich human being. And im more rich in more ways than money and if you dont see that when it comes to the average man you see in the street then i feel sorry for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:25:24
Trump knows what hes doing..... nah see you just lost your whole validation on your argument. That motherfucker was placed into office, his ignorance for the common way of life brought out people that hold hatred and wanted attention so they crowded around him and voted for him pretending they were being good americans while half of the population was saying that was a jack ass move. And it was. And now were stuck with the fat idiot.  
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:58:24
Thats what i thought too. I just know its used in phones fpr what ever reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:08:16
And it sounds like we have two different ways of life that have overlapping conflicts.. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:47:59
Yes i do believe it, the poor and middle class easily out weight the rich in numbers by millions. Take your pick. This is just in the US btw. Also most rich people are psychopaths that yearn wealth for reasons that really dont apply to the average intellectual. I want to live life, be happy, be stress free. I know for a fact that i want to suffer through it all because they go hand in hand. If i can see that wealth doesnt apply happiness in life then dont you think a genius wouldnt already know that? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:13:44
They will if bitcoin his 100k. Really hope it doesnt cause there is soo many rich fucks investing now and theyre going to make such a quick profit..
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:04:06
You might be fucking right

Its a good conductor, used in phones, and nasa uses gold foil for somethings. Its useful. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:21:53
Nah you fucked up, shouldve kept letting bitcoin rise because it will and then slowly paying off the debt wouldve helped build your credit score. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:35:55
Until miner get bitch slapped then no bitcoin isnt going to stabalize. Im glad its being bought again but it seems like its only for the dip..
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:50:16
You are going to be rich one day. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:07:31
Lmao yes. Poor people have to outgrow themselves to get somewhere in life, you know how many rich people have become rich off dumb luck, trust funds, inheritances. You really think some piece of shit like donald trump is smart? You understand that this countries taxes are made to facilitate a rich person to stay rich right? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:54:59
Coinbase, coinmama, localbitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:16:18
Move to alt coins! Monero!
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:17:50
They probably have money in there too...
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:56:23
No, when less than 1% control such a majority of wealth in the world not just the united states in general then we are forced to change that term. Im not trying to win this conversation man, im just enlightning you...
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:43:29
Phase 4: double dip and ill fuck you up
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:57:23
Yeah sure im jealous. Alright. You won the conversation..
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:44:03
Thats a bad decision. Ill buy their gold
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:58:23
I dont want rich people getting more rich off poorer people. If they buy early, were fucked because the price will start going up when everyone collectively starts putting money in. It will end up affecting the price when they pull out millions/billions... 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:23:31
Lol rich people include actors celebrities and models. Fuck out of here. Kendal jenner gets paid 21 million a year while your local professor that can out smart the whole family is making 70k a year. You are confusing greed for intellectualism.. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:47:24
Rich is middle high class. Middle class isnt rich either. This world has changed so much and so has its definition of wealth. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:09:11
I might fucking do it too....
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:52:05
I hope people arent that gullible..
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:59:26
Nope, fuck bch, people will dump it for alts sooner or later. People like to catch a wave and when they start dumping and people start panicking, you will see the fucking rise of atls sooooooo fast it wont be funny. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:27:28
This is the type of comment i want to drop. I just didnt have enough background on who is paying them to start shit.. good luck with the downvotes and people trying to discredit you.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:11:58
Truthfully bitcoin does need an upgrade. But its just bullshit to fall for a trap saying buy BCH
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:01:55
Can bitcoin just get a fucking upgrade already and end this comparison... 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:51:50
Dude if bitcoin doesnt upgrade it will be overtaken. Im just saying, i dont like bch, im invested in alot of other cryptos. But bitcoin will die if they dont upgrade and become better and not be manipulated by these fucks who cancel a fork last minute...
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:34:23
Now kiss
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:16:01
This is the issue i have with crypto right now. Until theres more people on the market, these whales are going to manipulate it to their will. Theyre too obvious and the fact that they do have shills spreading propaganda does create tension. Dont switch, its all bullshit. Bitcash is just a no for me. Im not falling for this trap and im not going to be manipulated by stupid ass downvotes... 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:08:46
They just did this to me last week, i wqs verified, i log in from computer and phone so no other isps. Its complete bullshit. They havent eben responded to my service request. They just constantly send the email saying they "kicked it up" to the support team. Fuck bittrex man.

Yall got snacks? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:28:35
Making more money on alts so im avoiding bitcoin until i have enough for 1 bitcoin... 
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:21:07
If you look at my comment history, i think i was talking to either an ignorant man who literally only told me about block chain size and speed being deciding factors.. or a fucking person trying to start the propaganda. I was getting upvotes then 5 minutes later came the downvotes. Its real at this point. Just spread the news and let the conspiracy come to light..
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:55:00
Lol i cant wait for it. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:08:27
Im not invested in bitcoin.... and i invest based on information, the market is extremely manipulated right. Fuck you mean, you really think people are investing bch pretending theyre going to commit to something that has been repeatedly spread as a scam? They just want profit. I get it. I just dont want it.
