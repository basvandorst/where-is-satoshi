To be fair, that's what Bitcoin was when it was worth next to nothing years ago.

I feel like that's slightly more idealistic than will be feasible. On paper yeah, you can, but I wouldn't call it a "bank account" especially as time goes on and more gets earned by the modern world

The blocktext with the largest sentence is the true blocktext. 
-Satoshi, probably

I don't love sharing this, but in the interest of full information, I found this that might back up your case a little.

I appreciate your tenacity, but you're gonna keep coming up with questions until you fatigue me out of responses. I wish you luck with your endeavors :)

There's a lot of people on the eth train, and there's good reasons for their chain choice.  Plus things like ark would swap anyway eventually, but I'm not that up to date with ark. 
Different chains for different brains, my man

Yep they're all 100% bullshit, every single one. No doubt absolutely you couldn't be more correct.  /s

One lives on, one slowly (or quickly) loses all its hashpower. As for miners stepping in for core, only time would tell. In the most basic practical terms, the chain getting its tx's validated more (more hashpower) is the dominant/"real" chain. Hypothetically, if 100% of all miners switched to, say, lbry, then lbry would in effect be the only active coin out there (that uses miners), because that would be the only one moving data

Name me one successful application for segwit with a huge userbase. Why is there disagreement? Isn't your platform the best platform? What's going on over in paradise?

So then you agree with the claim that BTC *was* a failure until '11? 
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:28:51
Still unproven maybe, I'm not well-versed enough to cite anything on that, but to say it's worthless while it's still young and being developed is a huge leap.  When/if eth gets its "silk road" that made BTC "useful" (metaphor only, don't take that literally) then would you change your position? As I see it, you could relate eth now to BTC pre-silkroad

So from '08 to '11, was it a waste of time/ completely worthless/ scam? Eth isn't even 3 years old yet
