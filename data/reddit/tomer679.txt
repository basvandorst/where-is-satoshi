Yes but you need to keep your profits and invest with money you can allow losing without wanting to get out a coin even when it's losing 5 precent. Most coins that is the daily average between low and high. Also trade on high volume coins. Volatility can be a game changer for your daily trade

We will see more of money losses the market is super inflated and leveraged. But when it will go up perhaps in a year or more it will be phenomenal. Just because people do not learn from mistakes. The real solution is intrest rising and governments start being more efficient. And as long you have populist clowns as decision makers, you will need to work hard and be creative to earn some money
