BTC has been a great investment vehicle for the majority of people here.  It is certainly better than your savings account which inflation outpaces the 0.1% interest rate you get.  
Time and time again, BTC always recovers and more.  When people invest in 401K or IRA, their money is stuck.? With BTC you have freedom to move and use at a much lower rate versus the penalty the IRS assess to you.  
I didn’t invest too heavily into BTC, as I am an Eth holder.  But what I do believe in is that BTC is immutable and not governed by anyone.  It is the token that started it all.  It is a threat to many nations monetary policy, because people are fed up with decisions by their elected officials to spend public treasuries and have the tax payers pay for it on the back end.  BTC is a way out for people who want an alternative.  
At least one thing BTC will guarantee is no inflation through dilution.  
Again I am grateful for all the people that made BTC the way it is, because none of this is possible if it wasn’t for BTC.  Therefore I had invested a share of my portfolio into BTC.  I thought the NYA was going to successfully take over BTC, I am so glad it survived.  
I have so much plans when I retire from crypto, I want to help people who work hard and are good citizens.  I am still working all of that out and will announce when the time comes.

There is enough people in the public to support btc.  The price may drop big initially but eventually due to supply and demand it will grow organically, due to the fact that there are only 21 million btc that will ever be minted and a lot of them are lost and locked away.

In a recession everything will pull back.  Real Estate, stocks, businesses will cut workforce, a few businesses will close, crypto will certainly go down as well.  There is no escape of a recession unless you have a large reserve of cash to pay off your expenses for the period of 1-4 years.

If the government expects people to pay for taxes on crypto, they need to change on how they are doing it now.  To tax every single transaction is just excessive.  There has got to be an easier way.  Such as only tax crypto to fiat trades.  The crypto to crypto is a nightmare to deal with.

The weird part is that one can only plan this if they knew it was going to be successful.  Many great innovators are all identified and known for their contributions to society.  Except for Bitcoin.  It is almost like it was done with the efforts of more than just a single person but some secret organization.  The more I think about this the more amazing the story is.

Then why are the videos of all recent event are made after the fact it already happened.  They claim that it was Libra or Chainlink or the Federal Reserve, etc.  are you saying all those people knew the reason why it went up?
Can you find a post of me bragging about BTC?  What are you even talking about?  Do you know who I am?  Then how do you know I have no knowledge of investing?  If you dig far enough you may find some interesting crumbs of information I have left on purpose.  You are probably part of the problem, spewing crap on the internet.

Talk about system failure, China has had a debt of $28 trillion dollars since 2016-17.  Their GDP was inly $11 trillion dollars.  They are 18% of the world economy and they are insolvent now.

What also makes Bitcoin interesting is the fact no one can trace Satoshi.  Usually who ever started something like this would be all over the headlines, but this guy is a ghost.

Interesting, I just looked into Monero and see that there is a blockchain explorer. I input an address and the explorer didn't allow me to see any details of it.  Which means, the Monero organization do have the information, but elects to keep it private.  Does this mean if law enforcement contacts the team and demand information, the Monero team will deny the request?  
I can see Monero getting blocked out by governments by the use of firewalls as they are aware of cyptocurrencies and anything they can't control, they will destroy.

Bitcoin shouldn’t be treated like currency because it is not managed or governed by any entity.  I see it as an ultra secure database that is incorruptible.  It is credits you can trust to be true.  Using Bitcoin as currency for day to day transactions are not so  ideal.  Using it for savings or as a safe storage of your asset, makes more sense.  But you must be responsible for your own security management.  
It is great that Bitcoin has come this far where it is used around the globe by all different walks of life.

Bitcoin doesn’t act like a currency.  It moves in the opposite direction against fiat.  It is deflationary.  No currency in the world grow over 1000% or 10000%.  The fact that Bitcoin is becoming more scarce is going to increase in value as long as demand remains unchanged.  I see Bitcoin a class by itself in which it is more valuable than fiat currency.  As more and more users loses or get locked out of their account by mistake, it is going to affect the supply.  I can see Bitcoin replacing gold’s financial uses.

I don’t think Bitcoin works as a currency, more like the world reserve, like gold but more flexible and easier to transact.  Fiat will never go away.  But Bitcoin will have value against all fiat.

True but in reality owning bitcoin seems to be easier and is more liquid than gold.  If you ever try to convert gold to cash you will never get the spot prices.  Sometimes 2 middleman fees which can take out 15-20% out of the spot price.

Here is my suggestion to learn.  Put all of your husbands stuff in a safe place and don’t touch it.  Now use $100.  And learn how to put it into a bitcoin address that you created yourself and practice sending it to another account your create as well.  You can do various methods to get your money into Bitcoin.  Either exchange, atm machine, craigslist, local bitcoin, etc.
Bitcoin.org is the official page to get information.  Use those links for wallet and exchange info.

One way to look at it is Market CAP.  It doesn’t take that much money to raise the price, because the price is based on trading for the current price.  High transaction rates means likely more BTC is exchanged at current rate to solidify the pricing.  If BTC rivals gold as a commodity a virtual storage, the inflow of capital from global markets can create that bull run that you are skeptical about.  If you track the addresses, majority of the BTC are dormant.  It is mostly the same players shuffling around and people in exchanges accumulating or day trading it.  The more people that trade at higher prices the more value is instilled into BTC.  A $50B cash injection can raise BTC market cap by $700B.  If all the market orders were fulfilled that would cause a bull run for the day until new supply is made available.  
BTC is worming it’s way into all faucets of the financial system around the world.  Nearly all of the population have nothing into blockchain investments.  I told myself the day my cousin gets into crypto, is the day Bitcoin becomes mainstream.

I think Bitcoin is a step above currency, I mean it has liquid value like a currency and can be traded into almost every fiat in the world.  There is a supply constraint so it will become more valuable naturally as time passes.  The built in supply halving is abrupt so it can affect the value in a volatile pattern.  
In order for Bitcoin to maintain and increase in value, transactions must happen.  When both the maker and taker agrees to a spot price and quantity.
Maybe it is not currency by your definition, but it is an evolution of money or what it will become.  The currency that ties in with all the fiat currencies in the world.  All traceable, accountable, already widely accepted worldwide, secured (no current exploits or weakness in the code), proven concept that works, owned by no one and everyone.

If everyone wants to cash out there will not be enough liquidity.  This is why the markets are constantly going up and down.  When there is a demand for bitcoin the price will naturally move up because the buyers will purchase whatever available order on the market for a certain price and will then have to start buying the orders that are priced higher and move in so forth.
If everyone wants to liquidate their holdings the prices will move down respectively.

At the time the US was 18 Trillion in debt and China was 28 Trillion.  That is where the 1 million millionaires came from.  They all scammed the banks for a real estate development project and fled to the US, Vancouver, Australia, all over the world causing havoc on their real estate market buying up properties cash at outrageous prices.
The IMF then allowed China to join and gave them the SDR baskets to make things even worse.  The whole fiat system is fucked.

When people suddenly become wealthy, the term is easy money.  Easy come and easy go.  Meaning they tend to spend money more loosely.  This seems to ring true to over 75% of the population.  Buying a Lamborghini can result from many reasons such as a hobby, dream, status symbol, thrill, obsession, displacing asset, girls, etc but all of these reasons comes down one variable.  Can you afford it?  
You can purchase in full, purchase in payments or lease.  There are methods for accounting loopholes for write offs and is irrelevant to this topic.  
If you survey the few dealerships that were advertising Bitcoin accepted, Crypto customers are not Lamborghini exclusive.  They will buy what that particular individual fancied.  
Lamborghinis have improved in reliability since VW Group took over, but they are still prone to random failures that could be quite costly if it is not covered under warranty.  Insurance is also another expense to consider especially if your age is under 30.  Service is not outrageous but is more expensive than the average luxury car.  
In society, exotic cars are often related to fast money / new money.  Lamborghini attracts more attention than comparably priced Ferrari, McLaren, Porsche, Aston Martin, Lotus, etc.  This statement seems to ring true most of the time.  
There is no rules on Bitcoin and Lamborghinis.  Just a mathematical probability.

I think we have been targeting the wrong people.  It is the bankers we need to worry about.  The government are just people who work for the bankers.  The Treasury department collects taxes using their IRS branch to pay back the Federal Reserve.  The corrupt government is selling off its greatest resource of the nation, its people.  But guess what, if we don’t use the Dollar issued by the Federal Reserves, they will become powerless.  The Fed has no gold reserves, no assets to issue value of anything in the first place.  So the US government has been buying Monopoly money from the Feds.  You in return are paying for the Monopoly money debt from the income you produce.

Yes, because I expect the supply to tighten over the years.  By the time the Thickburger is $25 each.  I estimate we would have passed through at least 4 more halvings.  As Bitcoin faces extreme deflation, the dollar would have lost 80% of the buying power at our current rate of debt growth for the past 15 years.  I see no concerns from politicians of the growing debt.  Just like when the Roman senators helped themselves to the Roman treasury until it was bankrupted.

A lot of people talk about the log chart but in real life there is no charts, just logic (commonsense) and science and a whole lot of chaos (caused by humans).  
Bitcoin could be stopped, governments can implement firewalls to block transactions at the ISP level.  They can implement laws to make it illegal for a period of time like what they did with gold.  
Maybe they can threaten and force Bitcoin developers to do something to sabotage the protocol, or figure out how to decrypt the entire network.  So many what ifs.  Or aliens attack Earth and severs all viral internet backbones, or the a solar flare during the magnetic pole reversal destroys all computer running nodes.  
Or the real Satoshi revealed a newer and better system and a majority jumps ship and abandon bitcoin.  Anything can happen in life and I been alive for too long to see some crazy shit go down.  
The logic price of bitcoin will be based on the good old supply and demand.  The good news is we know the supply chart, we just need to figure out the demand.

I would think a communist country would have a central government to regulate any entity from becoming too powerful.  Most businesses would be state run, such as power, water, energy, education, communications, technology, military, financial, real estate, healthcare, sports, automotive, aviation, science, biomedical, internet commerce, transportation, farming, etc.  then whatever left such as social, retailing and food can be freely run by the people with certain restrictions to prevent a monopoly.  
The government’s job is to ensure everyone is productive and somewhat satisfied with life.  With the government in control of most of the aspects within the nation most of the population are working under the government.  
Sounds depressing like an insect hive.  But communism ideally doesn’t make sense because of how high human intelligence and aptitude is.  It is like living in a cage, or as a child your whole life being told what to do.
I just don’t think an utopian society is possible because humans are so different from each other that you can’t please everyone.  Some people may like to live under a dictatorship, it is not my place to judge who is right or wrong.  It is all just a matter of personal preference.

I already knew the answer just being sarcastic.  The debt is based on the future taxpayers generations beyond.  So the government is borrowing non existent money printed by the federal reserve based on the I O U that the government is saying our taxpayers is good for the money.  But the real truth is the government is facilitating the transfer of ownership of its citizens.  AKA slavery.  The government is selling you via taxation.  The fed doesn’t need to feed you or house you.  You have to take care of your own health.  Also you will bare them future slaves because that is what they see your children as.  The people in government positions personally gets rich off of your contributions.  All the while they are not afraid of losing power because the people are so focused on attacking one another because you have different political views.  Obama, Trump, AOC, etc.  The greatest scam in history.

The answer is more logical than you think.  During a recession, cash is scarce and hence the term “cash is king” rings true especially during any economic recession or depression.  This is why crypto will not gain any meaningful value against the dollar during this period.  In fact the majority of asset class will devalue against the dollar such as real estate, cars, stocks, etc except for gold.  
Majority of the population on Earth are still ignorant about the value, security, technology or even the basic understanding of Bitcoin.
This is why I believe that having Bitcoin pegged with value of gold can help people bridge the understanding of the value of BTC and how it outperforms.

The next halving is 1 year away and the price could be $60,000 or so but I think it will settle at $15,000.  But after that the next halving will really shoot the price up as the rewards are literally nothing at that point.  Possible $200,000.

I wouldn’t go as far to say overturning a government.  It is more of a monetary issue where citizens can bypass the forced legal tender.

If you look at the board with all these posts of atm and shops accepting btc, and the transactions on the ln network, people are indeed are using btc.

Instead of looking at the price of the bill, look at the increased kw-hr used in the month.  
A typical machine can use up to 1,400w without tripping the wall outlet circuit long term.  
Now running it will be around 1,000 kW-hr additional per month.  If your increase is close to this figure, then she is doing some crypto currency mining shenanigan.  
It is unreasonable to use 1,000w continuously, even a heater will make the room too hot to inhabit.

Even if the merchant follow the rules, any customer can file for a chargeback whether they have a reason or not.  The processor will charge you $30 regardless you win or not.  Even if he customer accidentally did it because they forgot about the bill.

I am a huge proponent to the free world, but it bitcoin ever becomes a threat to fiat of any denomination, you can bet all of the governments in the world will ban cryptocurrencies.  
Just look in the past, the US banned ownership of gold and forced millions of Americans to sell their gold in exchange for paper money.  
If I was a fat sleazy politician, I would whore myself out to any bankers giving me any donation, gift, nominating my wife to the board of one of their charitable organizations, promise of a cush consultant job where I do nothing and get paid $ millions. Sure I would do that and screw the rest of the world because I am a politician, that's what we do.

How could you control Bitcoin?  The whole idea of Bitcoin is to be uncontrollable especially against governments.  Inly thing they can do is make a law like China to ban it.  But that won't stop the people.  Unless they setup firewalls blocking traffic which they won't do.

BTC doesn't need to ever scale up to the levels of credit card.  It should be different as it is a different currency.  BTC is great at exchanging for values and currencies.  Because of the fluctuating value of BTC it wouldn't be ideal to use it daily to buy milk and cookies.

Owning a Lambo is not really for everyone.  It is a cool car but the cost of ownership is quiet high.  Number one is the warranty, if tou can get the car certified for about $800, then you can buy a warranty package for about $3800-$5000 a year for a Huracan.  Then comes the tax and registration.  Then the insurance.  Not many people can stomach that kind of expense even if they can afford the car itself.  
I never had any problems with mine, but I got the warranty anyways.

Unfortunately the government officials will keep on getting away with this mismanagement behavior because 95% of the population don’t possess the fundamental understanding of how this will affect them.  So therefore there is no resistance in place to pressure them to stop this cycle.

I can't remember the details or find the link of the post anymore.  But it was a story of a guy who wrote that he escaped from Venezuela and maybe crossed in Columbia.  He said the government used the police to arrest him and tortured him into giving up all of his cryptocurrency keys.  He said he cracked and gave it all up.  They threatened they would kill his family if he didn't give them everything.  So he is now trying to get his family out of Venezuela.  He mentioned in one of Venezuela's press conference of displaying how they are investing or going into cryptocurrency and displayed miners, they were using his miners that were confiscated for display.

Reading from news articles on the web.
It seems because they already have private investors, they disclosed their revenues.  I remember reading how this year their revenue YTD has already surpassed their 2017 revenue and their 2017 revenue surpassed their 2016 by over 700% (don't quote me on that figure, pulling from my defective memory). 
I personally don't like Bitmain because I think they are doing more harm to BTC such as the BCH support earlier this year.  They also have the biggest marketshare in BTC Mining.  Also they have the ASIC developed for Ethereum and I suspect for a long time now.  Pretty much they are manipulating everything they are involved in.

This should be the way it is, otherwise it is just too difficult for most people to keep track.  Most traders that never touched fiat end up paying taxes and their stacks get smaller and smaller and at the end they will have nothing left after a few bad trades.  You can even owe taxes when you actually lost.  Where as the government could’ve made a huge capital gains tax when the trader cash out when he has concluded his trading.

The whole money scam is that people become in debt by borrowing money that the Federal reserve or the world bank didn’t have.  How do I know?  
Who in the world has over $250 trillion dollars in assets?  Nobody.  Remember the entire GDP of US is around $17 trillion a year.  At this point, currencies around the world is really just printed made up money by the banks that never had the assets to back.  It is issuing a debt note over Monopoly money.

Yes but gold and stocks can be confiscated away from you.  BTC is finite.  If you were to try and get Bitcoin from mining it will cost about the same as the current price.  Nothing is free in this world.  
What other store of value can be accessed and secured by the public without the help of private industries or governments.  
It gives people the ability to transact via internet without clearing houses.  A trustless system that you can trust.  
Just look at all the countries that has sanctions placed upon it, it allows them to bypass that.
In a world where corruption in governments increase, Bitcoin becomes more valuable.

No, the whole premise is that the money was backed by the promise the government made that they will be paid by the tax they collect from the people.

Ok first problem, go to bitcoin.org.  That is the true official website of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin.com domain is gear towards a fork of Bitcoin, known as Bitcoin Cash.  There are many other forks of Bitcoin, such as Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin BCH SV, Bitcoin Classic, Oil Bitcoin, Byteher, Bitcore, Bitcoin Nano, Bitcoin Silver, Super Bitcoin, BitcoinX, Bitcoin Hot, United Bitcoin, Bitcoin World, Bitcoin Faith, Bitcoin Stake, Lightning Bitcoin, Bitcoin New, Bitcoin Top, Bitcoin God, Bitcoin File, Bitcoin Segwit2X X11, Bitcoin Quantum, Bitcoin Uranium, Bitcoin Ore, Bitcoin Boy, Bitcoin Pizza, Bitcoin All, Bitcoin Private, Bitcoin Rhodium, Bitcoin Smart, Bitvote, Bitcoin Interest, Bitcoin Atom, Bitcoin Lite, Bitcoin Classic, Micro Bitcoin, Bitcoin Zero.

It is odd to get such a large number of users to get fished at once.  It likely was a domain hijack, dns spoofing or a widespread virus that tampered with compromised user’s domain name service address field.

Microsoft default loop back 127.0.0.1
Google 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4
OpenDNS 208.67.222.222 or 208.67.222.220

I been through these cycles and every time one thing has been an universal constant.  Cash is king.  If someone is desperate enough to unload their asset, that means they are in need of cash.  Not crypto.  
Usually I always have some nest egg set aside for these situations.  During recession, this is when Real Estate is cheap, businesses for sale, inventory clearance, massive layoffs creates a situation where everyone is short on cash.  Even the small to medium sized banks will get hit on their balance sheets when people default on their loan obligations.  
When people are struggling to obtain money, there will be no demand for crypto.  This is not a popular view, but I am pretty sure it is common sense.  
Fiat and Crypto need each other.  Otherwise why do we keep on comparing the prices?

Good point we haven’t had an USD collapse yet.  But if the USD does collapse, we will be bring down the entire world economy with it.  One of the reason why the USD is so strong is because our government encourages other nations to back it via bonds, investments and use it for trade for commodities.  
The moment the US removed the gold standard and went with a privately issued Federal Reserve dollars, we just sold our nation to the owners of the Federal Reserve.  No more current assets, it is now valued by our government to collect taxes to pay back the Federal Reserve.  The dollar was worthless, but because the US government is buying it at the given rate + interest.  We assigned it a value.  When the government needs more money to operate, we borrow money from other nations by issuing bonds with even more interest.  The privately held bank Federal Reserve owns all the debt of the US government.  It doesn’t want the debt to be paid.  It wants the debt to grow.  Because that is how you enslave the people as to what started out as paper money.  
I just hope I live to see the day we take back our country and crack down on all the corrupt politicians that is selling out our nation for their own personal gain.  Anyone elected to congress are now expected to be millionaires with free healthcare for life for their family paid for by us.  It is like winning a lottery ticket.  The only catch is you have to play ball with the establishment if you want a piece of the action and get re-elected.  
Technology has worked against the people with those in control of our distribution of media.  Both sides of the political party is destroying our country.  By pitting republicans against democrats, we are blinded by polarization and don’t see the greatest heist in history.  I say fuck the democrats and republicans.  Don’t fall for their talking points about welfare, tax cuts, environmental, foreign conflicts.  Nothing ever happens with it.
Who do you think destroyed the most powerful empire in the world?  From within.  Politicians.

Either they have a vested interest in the old establishment.  
The concept is foreign to them or makes the uncomfortable.
They are actually are too lazy or ignorant to even spend 5 minutes reading about it.
They felt they missed the boat, when it was $1 /$10 / $100 / $1,000 / etc and gave up.
They only listen to and follow certain figures.
They think it is backed by nothing and printed from thin air.  I think that is their favorite remark.  
Regardless, time moves on and they are not getting any younger.  They will eventually have to vacate and make room for the younger generations.  The only reason why Bitcoin is not any bigger is because those who govern the people can’t control it and this represent a small problem that has been growing into a bigger problem.  It is a threat to governments because that is one of the three core functions of any government.

@_date: 2019-05-08 20:24:05
Yes, but the roll back is what the official Ethereum Foundation team went for so it is the official chain.  
The biggest proponent to ETC is the saying code is law and etc.  ETC is dying out because they have no technical expertise to develop and couldn’t fix bugs in the protocol.  
The second biggest reason for support to ETC was that they didn’t think it was fair to bailout the DAO and their investors.  
If BTC does roll back for Binance, no good could come out of this.  $40M is not even a lot compared to the network.  The only affected party is Binance and not its customers.  So it is absurd to even suggest a roll back just for one company.  Especially if the company has a reserve to protect everyone and doesn’t affect the viability of the company (unless CZ was lying).
@_date: 2019-05-01 21:12:28
If you look at the daily volumes currently at $85M, he would buy up all existing orders on the books at the current price.  Some people may dump BTC seeing an opportunity to sell a massive amount without dropping the price.  
If the investor was forced to spend it all in one day it could rally the entire market to $15,000.  There are only so much people that are selling on a given day, the prices climbs real fast once he exhaust all of the current sell orders.  
Of course no investor would even spook the market as it will only be their disadvantage.

@_date: 2019-05-06 23:34:04
The problem is that the value of BTC has not been established, so to try and divide a BTC now may be immature.  We don’t know if we should divide into 100,000, 1,000,000, 10,000,000 or 100,000,000 per BTC.  
Maybe once the units are finalized they can just call them Bits.  I know majority of the world is going by Satoshis.  But bits sounds more friendly and simplified to everyone.  
It will just be little Bits as in parts to a bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-05-25 16:49:23
For you to say there is no use case it sounds biased already.  As I mentioned already there are people in certain countries experiencing hyperinflation and it is slowly replacing the way of life for these people.  Can you find a solution for these people?  The current system failed them and they have no options from the government.  A loaf of bread that cost them $1 million is now $2 million the next week.  How can they sustain?
Secondly if there are no use case, why are governments researching now to convert into cryptocurrencies?  Their current method of legal tender is susceptible to counterfeiting.  It also provides tracking.  That is something the current system can only dream of.  
Third, if I decide to put money into Bitcoin, the money is it as safe as I treat the key.  That is more convenient than any current method.  I can transfer millions of dollars for under $1.00 and no restrictions.  That is unheard of in the financial world today.  I remembered a friend of mine transferred $200 million dollars for a client in 2007 and the wire transfer halted Cathy Bank’s network for a day.  The US government wanted to know where the money was coming from and what it is for.  
The new world currency is the people with the rise of Bitcoin.  We don’t need to rely on government for tender.  The people can do it themselves.  I can’t think of another alternative today.

Bitcoin isn’t doing anything but to provide a secure store of value.  It is sad that the Federal Reserve had abused the system for so long that a program protocol that keeps track of accounts and values is worth more then legal tender.  If they want to blame anyone for the threat they need to look in the mirror.  The policy of trying to have the government build more debt is predatory to the citizens of the United States.

Assuming your computer doesn't get hacked, isn't it fair to say that most wallets have the same security?  For example, if you setup multi signwallet and keep all the passwords on the same computer.  Or if a hacker has control over your router and can sniff out all of your data (assuming your data was unencrypted).  
I guess what I am trying to ask is, if your system is clean.  Isn't your normal basic wallet safe?

You are underestimating the people at the Federal Reserve.  Why would they destroy the value of their source of influence?  
What is happening is their plan to increase government debt, therefore gets them into a position where they will own a bigger piece of the us revenues.  Once the debt becomes too large to repay, it will mean they own us.  Last I heard 10 years ago for every $1 we buy from the fed, we pay them $0.40.  I am too afraid to find out what it is today.

Don’t think a rollback is ever a possibility.  When Ethereum rolled back, it birthed Ethereum Classic.  It became the ugly child you can’t rid of.  Looking at ETC will be a good reminder what roll backs can cause.
A rollback should only be done if there was an error or bug on the protocol level.  Not from user events.  If they want to get back at hackers they can lobby for legislation to go after them with a harsher penalty.

It is backed by Trust in a trustless system.  It is a new idea that is not evident in society.  Imagine a system that is true and trustable.  It is verified by the entire community.  I mean this while concept is just amazing.  Because of how it works it is more secure than a network with just a few mainframes.  Hackers can attack and disrupt networks especially enterprises because all the nodes are known.  With Bitcoin they would have to compromise all of the miners or at least 51% and sustain it.  At this point that is very costly in electricity and equipment.  Compromised miners would shutdown and fix right away as they are not making money and that is their incentive to maintain a node.
An online ledger that is available for the world to see, no hiding, no secrets.  If an government was this open, they would be trusted as we can see where everything flows.  
This massive system is operated by the people for the people.  I can’t think of another idea that is more exciting than this.  For the first time the people can rely on something else other than banks for store of value accounting that actually works.  
Look at the nations with failed currency policies, they used to rely on other currencies like the USD or neighboring tender.  But now they are using Bitcoin.  It also proves that it worked and is currently working.  Bitcoin has helped these people in hyperinflation, where their government failed them.
I am sure Bitcoin has the attention of the governments of the world at this point.  It is too late for them to ban it without repercussions from the public.  Their tactic of dismissing its importance and ridicule no longer is working.  So what do they do?  They are joining it by trying to create their own versions.  However it will not work because what the people want is a free democratic system as the trust in government and corporations diminish.  
If people don’t want to experience civil asset forfeiture can they trust private entities or governments?
