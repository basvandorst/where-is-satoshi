Hi Adrian-X thats true, but for that to be profit, It will be needed a good BTC Minining investment. I want to simply trade :-\
@_date: 2016-03-23 19:05:44
Yep, esta dificil tirar daqui os kwanzas
@_date: 2016-03-23 19:08:46
Just so that people can understand it more clearly:
Bank rate is 183 Kwanzas per Euro, but banks dont have euros.
On the street people are buying for 350+ kwanzas per Euro.
So, as you can see there is a lot of margin and profit. Bitcoin, could short this gap, and make profit as well.

Exactly, the thing is that they almost dont give visas. And the ones that have visa, have really small limits.

Thank you sgornick, I will explore that information. I saw your other posts, in that thread, but export stuff is also "not an option" since the things here are a lot Expensive than elsewhere. I thinked in buy Luxury whatches with kwanzas, and sell them outside of here in €/USD/BTC but I would be losing a lotttt of money, since the sellers margins here are too big.

Thanks for the information. I will try check if they have a way to make it work with Kwanza. The problem is who will want the kwanza. But it's a lot of potential profit here, because people are desperate to get money out of here.

for sure it is, there's a lot of market to be done here, specially, because people are desperate to get their money out.
@_date: 2016-03-24 15:19:08
Yeh, exactly. and the "black market" does the prices that they want.
@_date: 2016-03-24 15:18:44
the issue is that I doubt anyone there needs kwanza xD

Hi deerreeder, thanks for the notice, but that's me, trying to buy Bitcoin. No luck atm.
@_date: 2016-03-29 11:12:29
Not really. :-\ I'm trying to bring awareness of Bitcoin here in Angola, talking with people, so people start to investigate about it, and what it is, etc etc, to get atraction on that, so that in the future, maybe Angola start to have BTC and exchangers here, so that I can swap my Kwanzas to BTC since banks are limitting transfers a lot. I know people that are waiting for a transfer since 4 months :\
@_date: 2016-03-23 19:06:11
Doesn't work, because for visa/mastercard it need to be usd/eur
@_date: 2016-03-24 13:23:31
Thanks samurai321. Localbitcoins I already posted a trade there, to see if someone wants to sell me Bitcoins, I will check mycelium, never heard of it. Regarding Security, it depends, There are safer zones than others. But I guess that's everywhere.
@_date: 2016-03-23 21:49:35
and how can I get paid in BTC? My employer is from Angola, and as such he pays me in Kwanza. :-\
@_date: 2016-03-24 07:36:47
Hi Adrian-X Thanks for the suggestion, and actually I'm mining already, but an altcoin, since i dont want to invest. I can't buy good hardware here in Angola in Kwanzas, and the money I have outside of country is not much already. My money is "stucked" here in Kwanza. 
@_date: 2016-03-23 16:03:25
I'm exactly in the same situation, I'm trying to find a way to exchange my Kwanzas for BTC or any other crypto currency but till now no success. rucafar, if you find any way, please let me know.
@_date: 2016-03-24 07:37:06
Thank you cointastical, will enter in contact with him.
@_date: 2016-03-24 07:34:47
Won't work, since I need to receive my salary in Kwanzas, and have taxes, etc etc. But is good to know. And thanks for the help. Yesterday I mailed Uphold, to check if they have plans to integrate Kwanza in their platform. This is desperate times, I'm with more money "stucked" here, than in my home country :-\
