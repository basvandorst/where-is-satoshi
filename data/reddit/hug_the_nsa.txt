Got a source on that? Everything I've read about Litecoin seems to disagree with you.

I also bought in with 500 dollars worth at 14000. We will see what happens. My current plan is to completely forget about it for the next week.

Dude.. Dips like this happen ALL THE TIME. It'll be over 20000 in a few days...
I can't garuntee that obviously, but I'd be shocked if it doesn't skyrocket back to new highs. I've seen it go up, down, and even make a circle many times. This is temporary. I bet your 1000 was well spent. Even if not, your wife shouldn't hold 1000 against you, as honestly that isn't much money.
My wife has been begging me to put 1000 in since I showed it to her when it was 5k. I put 500 in tonight during the dip. Even if you lose a grand that's not that big of a fucking deal if you both work. What maybe 2 weeks income at most if you live in the USA?

Of course they will. What people are saying ITT is that bitcoin is a mess right now. I know the dip is sort of ended at the moment, but it costs money to keep all these computers doing what they do. There will be fees. BTC fees and the time it takes for an average transaction are frankly stupid right now. A transaction should take at the most 10 or 15 minutes and at most cost 3-4 cents per dollar. That's the maximum a real currency could have. If BTC is ever to be a real currency this has to stop.

Sadly, because of the trap of fiat currency most people 20-30 have less than 800 dollars in savings generally in the USA.
It's sad.

This! What in the fuck are people siding with Tmobile for? Oh that's just the shills.
@_date: 2015-08-31 22:21:52


Build more or don't advertise the plan as unlimited?
@_date: 2015-08-31 22:20:58


Fuck net neutrality amiright?
@_date: 2015-08-31 23:03:17
The thing is though, if Tmobile offers me an unlimited data plan, and I literally max it out the entire month, that should be allowed. I do agree that tethering, when you only have X amount of Tethered data should be restricted. But if you aren't using the tethering, you should literally just be able to max your phone's bandwidth out the entire time.
That's what you offer when you offer an "unlimited" plan at least that's what you imply.. Same as at the buffet. I pay to eat there, to eat until I am finished. If I actually needed ten plates to be full, then they better be ready. I'm not the kind of asshole piling up food to take it home. I just want to use my phone at it's fullest capacity.
@_date: 2015-08-31 23:05:21
Okay, then downvote, why did you post this useless comment? What in particular do you disagree with? Do you really think a company should be able to sell "Unlimited" data that has a clear limit? That is by definition, not "unlimited."
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:00:31
Quick question, if I don't activate it, can I still use it to just monitor prices? How long does it work without me paying?
@_date: 2015-09-02 00:02:27
Not 4k, but 2.5k LG G4. 4k looks beautiful on that screen. And to be fair I never actually stream 4k or use that much data. In fact I pay for a fixed 10GB a month. I rarely go above 8GB. I just really think if a company has an unlimited data plan it really shouldn't matter how you are using the data, or how much, unless you are roaming I guess.

Literally because the banks, governments, and etc would kill him without second thought, for even thinking to threaten their system of enslavement.

Actually net neutrality is about treating all net traffic the same in terms of bandwidth priority. That especially includes the bandwidth going to the consumer.
That is to say, it's not about your speed, it's that your ISP is not allowed to slow netflix packets down on the way to your house. I honestly don't know anymore if that's still the case or not. I haven't been as up to date on this issue lately. But in around 2009 when I was arguing for this kind of thing every day, net neutrality ment the right of packets to flow without tampering, essentially.
@_date: 2015-09-01 13:39:11
It's actually not perfectly allowed now, because if it wasn't for throttling, etc I would be able to download around 2TB a month from my phone. In the blog post the T-mo CEO clearly says *Two Terabytes* Like it was some absurd amount. Shit that's watching netflix on my 4k screen for like maybe 6 hours a day.
