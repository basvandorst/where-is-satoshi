Not necessarily. The developers can be skilled at a language, but it might not necessarily be the best tool for the job. And Go may be your best bet, even if all the developers on the team don’t know it yet. 
Those aren’t buzzwords; they’re software development industry specific terms and jargon. An agile culture means that the company should be able to respond quickly to changes. As we know, blockchain technology is one the the fastest moving in the field, so it is important to be able have a culture and the right tools to be able to adapt.

AI is not necessary to complete those tasks, but is sufficient to complete those tasks. I’d be careful with your usage of the word “never”, as it is ignorant to the fact that human intelligence will always be sharper than that of artificial.

I’m sorry, but you sound ridiculous. When all you’re carrying is a hammer, you treat every problem like a nail. No, you should not use C for everything. You use the best tool for the best job. If it means training your employees or yourself, then so be it. You’re also very misguided if you think that some of the newer programming languages have no advantages over the older ones. 
You can enjoy your ad hominem attacks referring to my programming skills, but at the end of the day, if you’re going to be programming a front end website using C, you’re not going to be the one laughing.

Even though we’re on a different topic now, no.

I respect your work towards your degree in information technology, but I was speaking specifically about the usage of the application of a programming language to a specific job. 
I’m not sure what college you went to, but just because you’ve had an experience where people were misusing the words, doesn’t mean you should discount another person’s opinion who is using those words to convey a message.
