Any day the price is lower than yesterday is a good day to buy!

If you can't keep people busy with Church and Pro Sports. Give them Conspiracies. 
Fuck, just give them anything to believe in and occupy their time so they can barely ever accomplish anything.

Man that is a glove-fit statement. 
 When it comes to sustainability (Minus the fact of how our energy is currently being created) using a paper/metal-less currency seems logical. Also being able to print whatever normal stuff you may need. That could get ridiculous. Even food I've heard?
Was having a conversation about fur coats today and I hear peoples fears of all the animals being killed yes, but why don't people realize that the use of all the synthetic shit is most likely doing more damage. Giving the fact that a coat now-a-days is replaced every year or two. 
Have a couple fur coats(for different weather) for your entire life once you stop growing.
People just gotta have their new everything x10^23
tl:dr Im big into sustainability. Bitcoin has the potential to fit that agenda.

I am well aware. I have quite the beliefs, but in all reality. It is just one big circle-jerk. 
I mean the fact that it is quite known that Saudi Arabia was the sponsor to 9/11 and no one is WTFing our still current presence in Afghanistan, and now back to Iraq. 
Srsly Da Fuk man. Makes me sooo mad. And what can we do about that shit? 
Reddit needs to start organizing. It definitely has the capability as proven with all the charity fundraisers that were massively successful.

Well Thank you very much. That is actually the first time I have ever been tipped. Seems like I heard something on twitter it was becoming a thing. Is this true?

They transfered wealth into gift cards. Such could even be considered a currency. A private/exclusive currency only to be used with that group.
Now we have yet another 44bn lost in the system. Not technically lost from the USD since the companies received all of it, but the people lost it. There could be 44bn worth of goods or experience that went up in smoke because no one cares about 'the people.' The companies got paid. Thats all that matters. And that is the problem.

Tablet technology could far surpass a humans mere existence.
