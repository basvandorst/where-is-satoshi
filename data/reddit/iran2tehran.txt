Tons of banks don't charge fees for low balance. Most people are too lazy or stupid to compare multiple banks fee schedules or google "best free bank" before signing up. I was poor, I didn't get hit with b.s. fees, because before giving someone all my money, I decided to read what fees they would charge me. It's not rocket science, but most people spend 10x the amount of time deciding what restaurant they will go to for tonight than what bank they will have for the next 5-10 years.

See, that makes sense in terms of reasons why bitcoin/cryptos will never completely die. If they outlawed it though, almost no business owner is going to pay out crypto unless they're already in the business of doing semi-illegal stuff. I'm never going to take a legit job that pays in crypto if crypto was essentially banned outside of bartering. It's just not worth the hassle. If my landlord, grocery store, amazon, bank, etc, didn't accept crypto, why would I? I would have to find a 3rd party to trade it for cash and then take that cash to pay for my expenses. Just a huge hassle if I myself aren't doing anything illegal. In which case, bitcoin prices would tank, because most generally law-abiding citizens wouldn't bother with crypto. 
Cryptos will likely always exist for illegal activities going forward. But the market would be massively less (even from today's valuation), if it was limited to just illegal trades. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:25:19
I think that's overly optimistic. Currently what, a 1-2% are using crypto now? Average person doesn't give a shit if government bans something that they don't do. They may say, "oh damn that should be legal", but it's not enough to swing their vote on anyone.

It's a common reference point, because we know what eth and bch transactions cost in USD.

the loss can carry forward and can also be used against other capital gains. so you can do 3k/yr against your normal income until it is all used up or also offset a gain the following year

There's nothing artificial about it. It's just how markets work. Imagine you hold a lot of bitcoins right now. You say, I will not sell them unless I get at least $17250 for them. That's all that is happening. It's like if you owned a house and said, I won't sell unless I get 250k for it, while offers are coming in at 225k. You are not "artificially" holding the house price at 250k. You are just telling the market that that is the price you wish to sell your house for and you patiently wait until someone buys at that price instead of just selling it at whatever offers are on the table. The fact that all the sells got filled makes it pretty obvious that it was not a manipulation but a genuine sell.

Who has the name seems to be who mostly who has majority $. Ethereum left the party and kept the name, while eth classic kept the original code and lost the name, even though they stayed closer to the original vision of code is law and stayed on the original chain. BCH argues that who stays closer to the original vision should get the original name which I think is a legitimate argument, but it won't win because who has the larger amount of money has the power to win the name, just like it did in eth vs eth classic. If bch quickly ended up with a larger market cap than bitcoin, I'm almost positive that bch would be "bitcoin" now, and current bitcoin would have been bitcoin classic or bitcoin core.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:43:58
do they still have the bch from the fork, or did they dump theirs?

I don't really follow. I know how btc works and almost jumped ship over to bch around the same time the other guy did. I didn't end up jumping, but still have no idea why really. To me, btc and bch seem almost the same except for fees amd the last 5% of transactions. What am I missing?
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:56:27
You're right. It's a fallacy that makes 0 sense except so you can feel better later. It's optimal to set a desired % to a specific investment and cash out as the risk becomes too great for your entire portfolio.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:32:43
you can use up to 3k of losses to offset income in the current year. losses more than 3k carry forward indefinitely until used up: 1st against any outstanding cap gains, 2nd up to 3k/yr against income
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:14:44
DCA massively wins out in a declining market. It just makes sense.
If you put 10k in when S&amp;P is, for example, 2000. That's obviously going to perform worse than putting in 1k at 2000, 1k at 1900, 1k at 1700, 1k at 1500, etc. The latter, you end up with way more shares than buying at the peak.

super rich don't store their wealth in cash. They have to invest somewhere. If they think btc will outperform stocks and are comfortable with the risk, might as well hold it in btc. Personally, I would be selling at least some % frequently, and diversifying my portfolio into stocks, real estate, etc, but I can see why they wouldn't. If it drops 99%, they're still probably set for life. It's easier to gamble money that won't ever effect your standard of living.

the more apt comparison is stocks or currencies, which you can't do a like-kind exchange.

It will probably never go to 0, unless bitcoin has a bug that allows it to be hacked or something.

yes and no. smart brute force tries simpler things first, based on how people often create passwords. Like they might exhaust all the only # combos first if the password allows for an only number password. or they might try a dictionary attack with numbers like penis777, penis778, or p3n1s, etc. They may also run through other password lists of the 1000 most common passwords, which consist of stuff like password1234, etc. A dumb brute force algo would only matter the length though, yes.

to elaborate, it's not an anti-dutch joke. You could insert any nationality in place of the Dutch. It's making fun of the speaker for being so stupid to realize that he's being intolerant of other people's cultures when he says he hates the Dutch, so he's being a hypocrite/idiot.

Some people really hate working and don't get much pleasure out of activities related to spending money. A nicer car does pretty much nothing for me. If I had a job I really liked, I'd probably just max out my ira and blow the rest and then work until I died.

Well who knows how much money people are putting in or if they exchange from alts or whatever. It relies on some money, but it doesn't really matter the source. Some big holder of eth could fill that sell wall if they wanted, I'm sure. New buyers can often speed it up though.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:57:16
If a sell wall is broken at 17250, price should pretty much always go up after that, because the wall being broken represents lots of people willing to buy at 17250. If people weren't willing to buy at 17250 (and higher), the wall wouldn't be broken, the price would fall and the wall would remain.

afaik, is was 20k in one year in one transaction type. eg. buy 15k, sell 15k in 2013, doesnt count. but buy 21k or sell 21k in 2014 does count. So buying 2btc in 2014 wouldn't count.

That sounds like a quote from a movie.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:57:45
someone must be selling, or the price would literally already be like millions per btc.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:29:49
depends if it's a market order or limit order. market buy just buys all at the cheapest price available, so in the above example, they would instantly buy 8 @ 17 k and 2 @ 17250. A limit buy order would fill the 8 @ 17k and there would be a standing buy order for 2  until someone is willing to place a sell at 17k. the 17250 sell wall was a limit sell order.
On the exchange, there are always a bunch of buys and sells lower and higher than the last sale price waiting to be filled for when someone is willing to trade at those prices. current price is just the last transacted price, which will fall between the limit buy/sell orders not yet being filled. So if there is a huge sell wall like at 17250, price cant go above that until someone buys up all the 17250 sells. Conversely, if there is a huge 1000 btc buy wall at 17k, price cant fall below 17k until that many bitcoins are sold at 17k.

i somehow lose faster trading the alts
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:39:27
Yeah that's true, they both have legit claims to being closer to the original vision. There's no real way to make unbiased criteria for what that constitutes though. Main point was just that it's not really about the order of who left or original chain or where the party started or anything except just $.

funnny how the 3 replies doing the math came up with 3 different results (118, 18.06, and 20.7)

its often best to pick the 529 from the state you reside in for additional tax benefits, the downside is no vanguard  (usually). I get like $100/yr in state tax deductions to invest 3k/yr in a 529 with a slightly higher expense ratio than vanguard.

Presumably if you had stored the bitcoin on mtgox, mtgox is holding your bitcoin in Japan. It's a similar concept to having a foreign bank account. Sort of like if you deposit 15k usd cash in a foreign bank account. Both places require you to deal with a foreign company to access your money.

@_date: 2017-11-08 03:08:23
No kidding. A 2% drop on something like this makes no sense to me. I see 10% drops with almost no explanation. I was expecting at least a 10% drop.

Sounds like they're just making it illegal to run a business to anonymize the currency. It shouldn't affect most bitcoiners too much, and this type of legislation was pretty much expected, if not unnecessary, imo. I assumed that was already illegal.

it sort of depends on what kind of economic crisis. If it's the kind where people have to liquidate investments because they're out of jobs, people could be selling bitcoin as well. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:26:53
I'm 99% sure anyone can still buy s&amp;p500, etc. Although I guess it's possible a specific company might have some ridiculous rules.

also when you spend them as well. If you buy a $30 item in btc, you essentially sold $30 worth of btc
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:09:49
If it goes down to $40, there's no chance I'm buying. There would be some fundamental reason that would scare the shit out of me from buying.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:49:39
you can choose which, as long as it's consistent, afaik.
