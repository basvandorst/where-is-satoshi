Blockchain.info have had a number of of issues in the past. I'd go with one of the options OP suggested, or even better a hardware wallet. I personally use a combination of Ledger, Electrum, Copay and a couple of others.

You're absolutely right. Actually a bit annoyed with myself about that one!

Someone should make another fork and call it "Bitcoin Core"
@_date: 2018-05-11 15:24:18
This seems to be a recurring theme. Thanks for the suggestion! Throwing myself into learning all I can about how to use the LN myself.

This is a bit disappointing. Echoing what others have said, it looks more like an ICO marketing site. Would love to see more emphasis on the technology \(including current developments / roadmaps\) and what differentiates it \- there's not even any mention about the proven security of the network or anything like that.
At a bare minimum get rid of the price ticker, bitcoin is supposed to be global. Most of the larger alts don't even do this. The only one that I can see that displays a price ticker on the home page is BCH...

That's a good point. I've never seriously considered that as the client work I do doesn't involve a lot of real 'interface' design \(mainly working with artists and in creative fields\), but it's something I'd love to get into! First step is to understand all I can about LN. Thanks for the feedback!

I started trying to work on [something like this]( but it turns out I don't really know what I'm doing.
@_date: 2018-05-11 15:27:39
Thanks for the links! I've gotten a lot of friends and family interested in the space already and will continue to do so :\)
@_date: 2014-06-04 17:28:47
Professor Bitcorn was right!
@_date: 2018-05-11 15:22:57
This is great, thanks! Definitely agree that educational material would be a useful area to focus on \- bridge the gap between developers and non\-tech folk. Diving into the lightning resources so I can understand it better myself.

r/bitcoin is becoming a joke and needs some better moderators. How is this the top post?
@_date: 2014-10-21 18:58:31
Thanks for everything you've done and continue to do. I'm curious to know what areas of technology or innovation currently interest you most outside of Bitcoin and blockchain technology.

Here's the link:
If you're outside US, check out [Hola Better Internet](

This is already discussed briefly in some of the replies:
@_date: 2014-09-04 10:42:45
Just got my invite. Very impressed, this is the exact sort of thing that can get the most casual users on board using bitcoin. I'm pretty sure my grandmother would have no problems getting set up on Circle.
Unfortunately for the same reason as OP I'll need to wait until you can link UK bank accounts to use it fully. I was able to link a debit card with no problems but there appears to be a 2.9% processing fee to add funds with a debit card, plus whatever my bank decides to charge me (which would be a lot).
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:31:09
Nothing to add but **thank you** for everything you've done. It's genuinely inspiring \- the world would be an infinitely better place if there were more people like you.
@_date: 2014-07-28 19:02:01
This looks great! (I would also love some miles!)
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:48:42
Why should I be using paper wallets instead of something like Electrum to store the bulk of my coins?
@_date: 2014-02-17 16:02:26
Do other altcoins have the same transaction malleability 'issue' that the bitcoin protocol has?
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:16:01
From one of the subsequent replies:


The bitcoin community should be aware that their persistent and often times
aggressive, rude, and vulgar messaging towards me and my fellow coworkers
is not appreciated; nor does it help their cause. If the goals of the
cryptocurrency movement include shedding the world of fiscal dictators,
centralized control, and autocracy; then perhaps it is time for some
introspection. From my standpoint the actions of the movement (or at least
the actions of a significant number who are public on the internet that I
have read) are scarily similar to those whom the moment stands to replace.
&lt;/personal hat&gt;
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:21:54
Thanks! I vaguely understand 'how' it does it, was more the 'why' but you address that at the end. Makes more sense.
@_date: 2014-06-30 13:49:51
Why do we need change addresses? Couldn't the protocol work in a way so that the exact amount of an output would be spent in a transaction?
@_date: 2014-04-06 15:53:11
Here's some free money to compensate you. Don't worry, I don't need proof or anything, your story and that throwaway account is just too convincing.
Oh yeah, and definitely lawyer up, call the authorities, contact the press. Let's take this fucker down.
@_date: 2014-06-10 11:17:05
Thanks for this. The last point about backup maintenance is exactly why I've chosen Electrum as my primary wallet. I feel a lot more comfortable about backing up a 12 word mnemonic phrase.
@_date: 2014-05-03 15:12:30
Let's just use 'coins'. 100 satoshis in a coin.
@_date: 2014-05-03 15:09:34
I vote we just co-opt the word 'coin' and start using that. 100 satoshis in a coin.
@_date: 2014-06-05 11:22:24
Since this displays in USD, are they taking account of the market rate at the time of each transaction, or basing it on the overall transactions in BTC at the current USD exchange rate. Because isn't that a very different number?
@_date: 2015-08-28 19:33:51
I've heard of the service but not yet used it. In the past I've used Local Bitcoins, and a couple of different exchanges. Instant access is extremely important, it's why I generally use Circle to buy bitcoins at the moment (using a debit card), even though I'm based in UK and get hit with fees. I'd love to be able to buy bitcoin instantly with GBP. Will take a look at this. Congrats on 2 years!
@_date: 2019-01-28 11:56:53
I wish you all the best and I hope you find something that fulfils you personally as well as financially. Please try and be kinder to yourself!
@_date: 2019-01-26 13:40:53
I think you need to redefine your ideas of what it means to succeed. Find something you enjoy and that makes you happy. If you can make other people happy that's even better. Not everything is about 'winning' and 'losing'.
@_date: 2019-01-26 01:14:23
Dude, don't be so hard on yourself. You're not an idiot. Loads of people did the same. And,
if like you said, you only put in what you could afford to lose then it doesn't really matter. Money isn't everything!
