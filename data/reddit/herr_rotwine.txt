You're the one who brought CP into this first, son. I just used as an example to tie it into the conversation. Otherwise, I would've posted a different scenario.

I completely agree. Governments around the world have used fear to justify their actions for centuries, but they don't realise (or care IMO) that they're some of the the reasons people try as hard as possible to protect their data, liberty, and identity. Bitcoin, Encryption, Tor, ZeroNet, and other pieces of software are the reactions to their tyranny.

That's already happening. Even the NSA's upgrading to stronger forms of encryption. What I'm predicting is that some will not even bother *connecting* the internet and just consume content on LANs *that can't be accessed remotely*.
Imagine a group of pedo bears encouraging Little Sarah to do a "photo shoot", editing the pics on desktops with no WiFi/Bluetooth/NFC modules, storing the collection on a NAS or external drives, distributing it to other pedos via USB, SD cards, or optical media, and keeping their smartphones and tablets in Faraday Bags to hide its location. That's what mean when I say "pitch black".

Aside from their president possibly going back to [court]( over a few hundred corruption charges and a GDP of 0.7%, I can't find shit that would warrant such a spike in interest.

Both of those are good examples for what could happen, but in densely-populated areas. In rural areas, I believe we'll see more off-grid LANs that are isolated from each other.

That, ZeroNet, or some may just decide to move into a house, hardline a few desktops to a NAS, load it up with whatever they want/need, and give the internet a two-finger salute.

I sense that this will backfire in the future. They're afraid of the general public "going dark" (encrypting data to remain anonymous online), but I believe this rule change may encourage some to move into "pitch black" (closed circuit network) territory.
