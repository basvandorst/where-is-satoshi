Scans for me without a problem:

I also showed them some bitcoin love (£140 worth of RAM). I was a bit nervous to use it too early in case there are early integration issues. But all went smoothly.

For some people credit/debit cards aren't easy to get (young/unstable work history etc). Developing countries don't have easy access to credit/debit cards either, often having to pay monthly fees for the privilege of having something with visa/mastercard on it.
I think bitcoin could be big in India and Africa as internet is spreading faster there than modern banking.

What are the implications for non-miners i.e. normal bitcoin users? 
For instance I know my wallet client(multibit) doesn't need to download the whole blockchain, only a small chunk of it, and I assume that has something to do with the 1MB block size? So if the block size is 8GB for instance, would that affect the performance of wallet clients?

Barclays suspended my account just for trying to buy bitcoin (from a top rated localbitcoins seller). I had to phone to get me account reactivated.

If you're patient. When (if) fidorbank.uk opens, they will be bitcoin friendly. They are busy trying to negotiate access to the UK payments system from the big banks.

I am afraid you are probably right. Their site and forums do still say "coming soon" so, maybe they'll pull off a miracle.

My experience (also UK) with localbitcoins has been varied, I have bought a few times successfully, but on one occasion I did have my card blocked when doing a faster payments transfer to a localbitcoiner then had to phone my bank to get my account unblocked. 
So far, for me the best way I have found to buy is through an exchange (bitstamp in my case) and a Leupay account because their Sepa transfer rates is 3 EUR vs my bank's rate of £10.  Fidor bank also has good looking Sepa transfer rates of £2.50, but I haven't tried them. 
However, as in your case, both of the above required various forms of ID and waiting 48 hours etc..
