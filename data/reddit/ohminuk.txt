On another thought - you may want to add how many addresses were matched to the nth letter! That way you can see "how close" you came in guessing.
Something like "7300 addresses matched 3 letters of used addresses, 411 matched 4 letters, 3 matched 5 letters, and 0 for 6 and above. - It would need 48 matching letters to have the same bitcoin address".

@_date: 2014-08-19 20:47:00
Lol, could be - having a botnet operational also costs some time and money. If your botnet mines bitcoins, then it's not available for other nefarious tasks (you cannot rent it out to even meaner guys than you for example). That's called opportunity cost.
So yes, even if you can steal the processing power it might not make sense economically.
@_date: 2014-12-11 23:31:31


Did you make that up or is it a saying? I like it!
@_date: 2014-09-03 07:31:02
Correct. I would put that as a conservative estimate. If you feel lucky and reduce average difficulty increase in the calculations, you might get out up to ~0.6-0.62 BTC tops. Factor in electricity, pool fees, and the time you need to have it shipped and set up this would be a losing proposition.

Hey smarts, where do bitcoins from OTC/brokers come from?
@_date: 2014-08-19 17:22:44
That's exactly what a pool does. The pool master node gives out work which is done by everyone connecting. The difference is that  to be competitive in bitcoin mining you nowadays need to operate special hardware (ASIC mining equipment), as CPUs and GPUs just do not cut it anymore. Just for comparison, a mid level ASIC mining rig does ~500GH/s, while top-of-the-line GPU cards just do ~1GH/s. 
So you'd need ~500 High end gaming PCs for the same network share you can easily do with one ASIC rig. You can imagine that for initial cost and power consumption over time, this is a very unfair battle if you have to pay for either resources. 
@_date: 2014-09-04 09:09:13
No, it doesn't change a thing. You still have to compare the end results.
Say you buy a miner for 5 BTC, and over its lifetime you only make 4 BTC back. Then you only make your invested money back if bitcoin appreciates in value 25%. You only make ROI in dollars if it appreciates more than 25%.
If you just buy BTC, you make an ROI in dollars if bitcoin appreciates more than 0%. Sounds better, doesn't it?
So if you cannot mine more BTC than you pay for your rig, the better alternative is buying BTC. The bigger the difference between total BTC mining payout and rig price in BTC, the more you need BTC to appreciate in $ value to break even or make a profit.

@_date: 2014-09-02 15:42:47
Realistically you can only expect 100*daily return for any miner, if you expect a 20% average difficulty increase. So to calculate if you can hope to make a return on investment, take the expected daily payout (calculate here according do your hashrate:  and subtract daily electricity costs (in BTC) and 1% of your initial hardware costs. 
If you come out with a positive number, great, a profitable operation. If you come out negative, which is the likely case, you should think wether it makes more sense just to buy the coins and avoid all the mining hassle.

Yeah sorry, that was unclear - I fully agree on the fact that you can prove it existed BEFORE a certain point in time. But the second proof you mention ist much weaker:


My point is that you can manufacture this thing that only existed after a point in time into the picture, ie. fake that it has not been taken earlier.
Eg. You take a picture of your computer screen showing the last bitcoin blockdata. Great, the modern equivalent of taking the picture of a newspaper frontpage. While it may seem as proof, it clearly is not, because you could have taken the picture much earlier and just photoshopped the latest blockdata into the picture. 
It certainly takes time and skill, but it probably wouldn't be too hard to look convincingly to the layman.

According to 
a pi gridseed can do up to 1.3 million hashes/second.
That's a whopping 109.6 Gigahashes per day, or 39 Terahashes per year.
The percentage of valid hashes you should find on average over the course of a year is (A) (your yearly hashes / the networks yearly hashes) * 52560 Where 52560 is the number of hashes usually found in a year.
The network's hashrate is currently almost 200 Petahashes/s. If that increases exponentially in the way it has done the last 12 months, we could very well end up with 4000 Petahashes/s in 12 months time, equivalent to, say, 1500 Petahashes for 12 months.
To put that in perspective: You do 39 Terahashes in a year, the network will have done 1500 000 Terahashes per second over the whole year! 1500 000 * 3600 * 24 * 365 = 47304000000000 Terahashes total!
Now filled into equation (A) 39/47304000000000 * 52560 = 0.00000004333, that's the average number of valid hashes you will find with your pi/gridseed over the course of the next 12 months.
Good luck!

Of course you would mine some bitcoin - but if you mine with one thousand PCs or a million it does not change the economics of it. Your cost for electricity of running them would still be a factor of 500+ higher for the same network share someone gets mining with ASICs.
If we suppose that with an ASIC you about break even in hardware/electricity costs vs bitcoin value mined, your PC network spends 500*$480 = $240,000 dollars to mine just 1 bitcoin! Now talk about waste!
Of course, if you don't pay for the network, because computing power is donated or you are the evil operator of a botnet, you still might want to go this route.

Still no ROI (it's worse as current difficulty will soon be higher):
Calculating daily BTC payout:
    0.458 TH/s device @ 27.4 billion difficulty:
    0.458 / (2*27.4) = 0.00835 BTC/day
Payout over lifetime (even with just moderate average difficulty increase):
    @ 16.667% average difficulty increase:
    Total expected BTC = daily BTC payout * 12 * 1.1667/0.1667 * 0.8 = daily BTC payout * 84 * 0.8
    
    Total expected BTC = 0.5616 BTC or in dollars $261 @ $465/BTC

@_date: 2014-09-14 18:48:14
Some people on some bitcoin exchanges agree on a price of bitcoin, and some of them even buy and sell at that price. That's all there is to it. The market cap is just the illusion that you can measure how much all bitcoin would be worth if you could exchange it for X amount of dollars (X being the current market price). If people on the exchanges agree on a price that is $10 higher tomorrow, that obviously changes nothing about the total dollar amount in the bitcoin market. 
The only correlation there is, is that if dollars enter or leave the market, it helps to build either a buy or sell pressure which can move the price and therefore the market cap.

Slowly but surely people interested in "good money", ie money where supply is limited, will be driven to bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency. Once that exodus gets going there is no stopping it - PM performance will get worse and worse, while the rising cryptocurrency takes it all. There is just no scenario where both can be in a balance, because at one time the scale will tip and there is no going back.
I also think you overestimate the industrial need for gold by several orders of magnitude. More like 0.4%

If there is nothing wrong with PMs, there also is nothing wrong with today's banks. I don't dismiss it as an asset class, I just said don't buy them. 
If you believe in bitcoin you should run away from PMs as fast as your tiny little legs can carry you. 
[sidenote not pertaining to my argument: It is also clear (to me) looking at the market and it's participants that eg gold and silver will continue the bear market trend for a good while longer. I wouldn't be surprised for gold to touch the low 500s.]
Someone in the replies said:


to whom I answer, "Past performance is no guarantee of future results". Don't think PMs are an exception to this. A paradigm shift towards cryptocurrencies as standard "good money" will INEVITABLY wipe out much of the premiums that PMs trade over their industrial value. However long PMs have held their value before during all of mankinds history is utterly irrelevant.

I'm sure they do that - that is was bitfinex was doing at the beginning in order to show full orderbooks to users and thus provide liquidity. I presume they will slowly phase out the link after a certain threshold of own users/volume.
In fact it's pretty clever when you see it as an chicken-egg problem for a new exchange. Nobody would want to trade there if the spreads are to big and there is no volume. On the other hand the volume wouldn't grow because new user are hesitant to join. 
Parasiting the orderbook of another exchange solves this problem, you just have to make sure your linking algorithm works well enough (I'm sure people think of ways how to take advantage of such a linking) and prey that the other exchange doesn't fuck up, as you have to keep a good chunk of your coins on there.

@_date: 2015-03-05 10:36:31
You see the thing that troubles me a bit is, that the crystal currency is only used as "presale money", something that usually only makes the ones rich selling to the public. The two aspects, using counterparty tokens for in-app items and the crystal money could be completely separated - the former being a great idea, the latter more a money extraction scheme.
Why couldn't you just sell in game items just for bitcoin directly? Right, because you can't create bitcoin out of thin air, to later dump on the secondary market when the item economy had been established.

You probably should be able to transmit blocks within 10-30seconds maximum to help the network (I don't know really, but that makes sense when you consider that blocks can come in shortly one after another). 
So at 12.5MB/s you can participate until blocks are 125-375MB in size, or roughly until we do between 300 and 1k tps. 
Edit: No idea though how much upload bandwidth you need though (Your 100Mb/s most likely is download only?)
I guess even in the most optimistic adoption scenario of bitcoin you can run such a node for the next 5 years easily. I highly doubt though that we double usage every 6 months, that was a rough guesstimate for the upper bound of growth, but who the hell knows.

@_date: 2015-02-18 16:06:42
Why do you think storage is a problem? Just run the numbers. Today $250 buys you a nice 6TB drive, enough for around 4k sustained tps during one month. And 4k tps is around VISAs daily peak transaction rate.
If you want to run a full node on a RaspPI on the other hand ..

Sure. Say you have some funds available to you on a broker who lets you trade on margin (eg Bitfinex in the bitcoin space).
Other people on the providers site let you borrow their money, in return you pay them interest on the funds you borrow and the provider makes sure that you always hold enough funds to be able to repay everything.
Now the fun starts. Once you have borrowed the money (or bitcoin if you want to short), you buy real bitcoins on the market as if it was your own money. Now if price increases, you can sell your coins and repay your creditors and have some leftover. This leftover money is your profit.
Now you say why dont you buy the bitcoins with your own money, if you have to have funds to borrow funds in the first place - good question and here is the key: You can borrow much more that you have, that's called "leverage". Eg. on bitfinex you can borrow 3.3 times as much as you bring to the table. 
That also means that your gains/losses multiply if price moves in the right direction or against you. All in all this is a very risky trading style and should be left to professional traders. You can lose (almost) everything if you are "margin called", ie the broker is asking you to add more funds but you cannot. Then your positions is "liquidated", ie. the bitcoin you bought are sold through a market order, the proceeds are used to pay off part of your creditors and the difference still missing is taken from the funds you have deposited at the broker's. The margin call comes early enough to make sure that the value of your funds + the coins bought on margin at market value &gt; open debts with creditors.
Hope that helps.

Thats Visa's burst capacity maybe? On average they process 2000-3000 tps.
The $250 are theoretical, because when bitcoin reaches 4k tps (vs the 1 tps it is now) costs/TB should be a lot less.
Edit: At the moment, at 1tps, bitcoin storage costs you &lt;10cents a month.
Edit2: Even if usage doubles every 6 months, 4k tps still takes another 6 years! (
Edit3: Just calculated storage costs according to the formula from the article and it predicts storage prices of 20cents/TB for 2020.
