Watch the clip above Jesus.
Edit: it's sarcasm. Rick is saying he has all these catch phrases. He literally says "lick lick lick my balls! Say that all the time"

I'm not religious, but nice try. I'm just not some 16 year old edgelord who judges everyone in mass because you think you know shit
And I can jump in when I want, it's not a private thread nor is it locked. You said something incredibly ignorant and stupid. Therefore I'm going to call you ignorant and stupid. "religion is the mass control of all people!" lmao. Okay buddy. You're demoted to a 15 year old edgelord for that one. Favorite sub is r/atheism isn't it?

Lmao. Okay little guy.

Ding ding. I really hope they are 16. Otherwise this viewpoint comes with a free fedora and neckbeard.

Oooh keep it up with that edgelord opinion and proving how little you know of the world's religions. Call billions of people idiots too, really proves how smart you are.
Every religion offers peace of mind? No, they don't. At all. Some are unbearably strict and exist to force you to think differently and critically.

... He could have invested 30k long ago and have mroe then 17m in bitcoin. Pretty obvious what he was saying.

'this is fact'
No, it isn't. It can be your dumbass edgelord opinion, but it's not fact. Some religions don't even offer an afterlife, what reward are those people getting? I genuinely hope you're under 16. Otherwise this viewpoint is unbelievably naive.
