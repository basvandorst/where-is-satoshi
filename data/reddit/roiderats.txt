I'm not 100% certain but few days ago I started a node that was few months behind. It was already set to prune. What I think is that it didn't spend any more disk space, not even temporarily. But this is more a gut feeling based on few runs of /usr/bin/du during those days.
Edit: The node was off 2017-01-16 - 2017-02-07. Based on  so 98GB -&gt; 101GB is such a small change I wouldn't have noticed. So my comment is pointless.

Perhaps you could overlay a pie-diagram over QR-code, so that the machine readable data is still in black-white blocks. But the pie-diagram would for example have 4 simple color, or 3 simple colors and one 1/4 that has lots of white-red slices etc., so you could have only a short hash of address color-coded. That way you could quickly use your shape-detection part of your brain to see if two codes are(or likely are) the same.
Maybe the pie could be semi-transparent so there would be useful bits of QR-code behind it or maybe you just trust the error correction of code. It's quite common to have something overlaid on functional QR-code so it's doable.

Bitcoin becomes "digital gold" (economic perspective)
Yang Wang Jiang Ning
"People's Daily" (May 26, 2021, 21 edition)
Digital currency bitcoin single dollar value 24 days to break through 2,400 US dollars, a record high. Since this year, the transaction price of Bitcoin has been rising, the cumulative increase has exceeded 150%. "Bit coins today, how many knives?" Has become the current digital money players special greetings.
 Bit currency rose crazy, due to multiple factors to promote the common.
 First, the shrinking market supply is a key factor affecting the price of bitcovers. In January 2009, when the Bitcoin system was launched, the system designer would limit the total supply of Bitcoin to 21 million, and the current amount of production has reached 16 million, more than 75% of the total. From the circulation level, as time goes on, the bitcover system "mining", that is, the transaction bookkeeping bonus every four years by half, from 50 in 2009 to today's 12.5, which directly affects the bit The supply of currency flows, resulting in higher prices.
 Second, the special currency trading system technology upgrades, to a large extent to enhance the venture capital and the development of geeks confidence, resulting in short-term strong growth in bitcoin prices. With the popularity of Bitcoin and Block Chain technology, the daily volume of Bitcores reached an astonishing 250,000 to 300,000 pen. However, at the beginning of the bit on the line in the first time on the data capacity of each transaction was strictly limited, resulting in today's up to 158,000 pen transactions waiting for verification, but also forcing users to pay high fees to speed up the verification, which increased The difficulty of paying the bitcoin. However, the two recent expansion of the speed of the program - "Bitcoin unlimited" and "lock isolated testimony" (SegWit), is expected to improve the efficiency of bit currency transactions, get more than the coin community, "miners" and technical geeks The enthusiasm of the market for Bitcoin was rekindled.
 Of course, the surge in Bitcoin also benefited from government support. Part of the country's policy support for Bitcoin and the development of the legal digital currency system have contributed to the rise in the price of bitcoal transactions. In particular, the US Securities and Exchange Commission decided to review two funds in the same period in May, and will release the results in the near future; Japan announced the recognition of counterfeit currency and other virtual currency as a way of payment, and cancel the consumption tax; 2018 recognition of Bitcoin and other encrypted digital currency ... ... plus China, Britain, the Netherlands and other countries to speed up the release of their own legal foreign currency policy initiatives, attracting some businesses trying to use the bit currency to pay the settlement. At present, the United States, Japan, Japan, Europe and other countries and regions, respectively, 73 million, 73 million, 45 million and 31.4 million US dollars on average daily trading scale, leading the global bit market. According to preliminary estimates, by 2020, Bitco currency transactions will exceed 3 billion US dollars, the transaction price may reach 10,000 US dollars.
 This year, the bitter currency price "high fever", has repeatedly exceeded the price of gold, so with the "digital gold," said. However, Bitcoin as a virtual "digital gold", although with digital properties, but do not have the high flow of gold, low risk, stable value and difficult to control the property. Therefore, Bitcoin is still a high risk, high expected return on investment products, still face regulatory changes, consensus mechanism to crack, legal digital currency replacement and a series of risks, mainly for short-term price shocks. Therefore, it may be concerned with the perspective of monetary innovation to focus on its digital properties, with a prudent approach to look at its gold properties.

Just found a paper slip with some cryptic letters and remembered... so, here's how I can still see my Mycelium tokens, hope this could help(I never had a phone app thou):
 1. surf to 
 2. enter your email and password that at some point you've given(don't remember when)
     -&gt;  you'll get an email with a link and confirmation code. No idea what to do with the code but:
 3. open the link in the email
     -&gt; you'll land to the page asking to decrypt the wallet
 4. enter wallet password 
     -&gt; watch the worm game animation
 5. You're in, and there's your Mycelium tokens
edit: formatting
edit2: still no formatting, giving up
