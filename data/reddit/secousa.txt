is scrolling the only option due to some character limit on the display? as a user I prefer not to have it scrolling, but display in full like the trezor does

While there are no reports of any at this moment, it's safer to assume that they are present or incoming.
Here's validation that it has been vulnerable in the past.

There has been a large influx of malware wallets going on the various app stores. Always check Bitcoin.org for wallet links.
Edit: in fact...

paging is there any plan to update the firmware on the Nano S to show the full address?
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:07:32


yes. it can be either over or under $1 million. your question sucks.
@_date: 2016-08-30 17:58:06
the difference is this one is not branded as Poloniex. The other one was made to look like an official app, this one is clearly a third party

125K BTC initial estimate based on that link
The math, for whoever wants it:
1.97085826 before the movement, minus
1.84466525 (lowest point after the movement) =
0.12619301 million 
edit: My guesstimate was a bit off, has confirmed the amount of 119,756 BTC here:

From reviews it looks like the ledger does not display the full addresses - only first and last parts (center is ...). Doesn't the trezor show the full address?

this needs more upvotes so the trolls in the rest of the thread can STFU. OP is real, that is his real money, and yes its a real loss. It cannot be easier with trolls pissing all over his credibility.

really don't think that's an amateur attack.
@_date: 2016-04-21 02:05:09
good luck. Contact all the exchanges now. Also, any of those files linked that you think are malicious...please break the link (use hxxp:// instead of  to prevent anyone else from being affected.

reddit account was also hijacked, here's the original post: 
@_date: 2015-05-02 21:38:02
i copied my key to another device. it only showed a single account. frantic, i started adding new accounts. guess what? coins showed up in the new accounts
the seed is for the root account, and you have to manually add the extra accounts you had after it. so if you had 5 accounts, add 5 new accounts on your new device. coins will be there.

calm your tits. they still offer it at normal price if you're willing to wait. its better than running out of stock and allows for those that absolutely need one now to be able to get one without having to wait, albeit at a premium.
EDIT: and the difference between your Martin Shkreli argument and Trezor--
MS hiked up prices by 20X and 56X. Trezor hiked it up 1.2X. Big difference.

Do you want a quality delivery of code or do you want a speedy delivery of code? I work in IT. Generally speaking, quality of code suffers when you go the route you've proposed.
@_date: 2015-08-26 19:14:07
he did but improvements were made by Mark himself. unlike BFX.  
Bitfinex found the code for a ded exchange.
They hired "myself" to build on extra features! Then, once built, promptly removed "myself" without pay.
If you have money on bitfinex - withdraw everything and move to another exchange.
@_date: 2019-06-15 07:24:47
Nice story!
@_date: 2015-08-26 19:04:10
you know all the non-bitcoinica stuff was developed by a user named "myself"? those features alone are what made BFX as big as it is today, otherwise ppl would never have flocked there.

Sandbox environment...already destroyed the VM it was running on
@_date: 2017-05-02 18:49:20
I did it. The script failed to execute some application it built. Symantec did not catch the document, scripts, or the executable that was generated.
Before I get chewed out, I did it in a sandbox environment to see wtf it was.
edit: some screeshots of what it looks like when you open it... mine errored out (fuckin noobs)
