Where did you get this 2k number?

Thanks Bobby, I did contact them, but the fee was 2.5 btc for 1 block reward - far too steep a fee

Centralization of development within an organization designed to monetize future Bitcoin direction is a clear conflict.
Regardless of which subreddit you subscribe to, I don't see how we can't all agree on that.
There's plenty of money floating around to fund development without our top minds working for a start-up on the side.

I find your mint project super interesting, but I'm in the US. Would love to get some "freshly minted" bitcoins without the physical coins, but you guys are selling 12.5 BTC for 15 BTC which seems a bittttt steep, don't you think?
Are you seeing demand for BTC with no TX history?

From what I've seen, they have a lifetime spending of only $2.5k if you want to stay anon.  If anyone's found a way around that lmk.

I love this post so much. Without a doubt, control of wealth is the core value prop of digital currencies.  Sad thing is, growth comes from people learn this the hard way.

Gear FTW, however they purchased it from the original developer who has since left. It works great, but is poorly supported.

Got a Ledger Nano S during black Friday and transfered all my BTC, LTC and ETH to it with zero trouble - loving it.

Bitcoin is still terribly confusing to most people. Coinbase has 5 million customers now.  A fair excuse for their support might not be as fast as many of you here hope.
