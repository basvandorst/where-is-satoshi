I used to like mike but he is such a scammer, for years I kept getting emails from him (or his people) telling me to buy more gold / silver from him because it's at a temporary low. Then the price drops like 25% and he has the nerve to send the same type of sales email. 
"Currently the prices of gold and silver are artificially low, being manipulated by the large banks. This will allow time for more of the middle class to protect their wealth." -silver at $45, gold at $1900
"Mr. Maloney feels that we are in the early part of the second pause of a three phase cycle. And at the top of this cycle the price of silver and gold will be much higher. " -silver at $31, gold at 1500
today silver is at like $20, gold at $1300  
Be very careful trusting this man because if you did at the wrong time then you'd have lost half your money in a period when stock markets did amazingly well (double loss!).

Think of candy as money, everyone wants candy! It's Halloween and the kids just got a full pillowcase of candy. Parents are more responsible than kids so to prevent tummy ache your parents offer a little extra candy if you let the parents hold on to your loot. 
Now something goes wrong in the grown up world. They are saying they can't afford candy to add to your stash. No extra candy will be given (0% interest rate). Your friend Alice gives in and eats an entire ginger bread house, your friend Bob eats his multi-tiered multi-flavored ice cream cake, but you trust your parents ability to bring in more candy later on so you don't want to eat it all just yet.
Now your parents tell you they will eat a tiny bit of your candy every once in a while (negative interest rate). You were saving up for a trip to willy wonkas chocolate factory, it only opens on December 24. Time is running out. Weeks go by and you can't find a good way to build up your candy. Your parents are slowly eating it. You realize you will never have enough to go to willy wonkas (retire). You eat all your candy, get diabetes, and your foot falls off.

I don't think you can label a miner (basically a computer) as a capital expense. 
First there are rules for writing off depreciation, look up CCA. Basically if you buy a computer for your home office it's not a one time loss, it's a gradual depreciation of value which you can slowly write off.
Second, I assume you are a sole proprietor. When I was a sole proprietor and bought a home office pc I couldn't write it off. I may have been able to if I paid my accountant for it but I'd end up broke either way. If you are incorporated then you could probably use the same CCA (capital cost allowance aka depreciation) as a computer / server.

LBC lets users create their own wallets within their site that holds  coins. When you try to sell BTC, the buyer triggers LBC to put the requested amount in escrow under the control of LBC. If both parties are happy, the BTC are released, if not LBC steps in and handles the conflicts.

Actually I agree with your title that Costco would be perfect for bitcoin, and I don't walk around with much cash, but here is the reality you are ignoring: bitcoin is not perfect for Costco.

If I were you I'd buy from localbitcoins.com, I gave up selling there because  margins are very reasonable (good for buying, bad for selling). If you are patient and prepared to provide a lot of paper work you should register on an exchange like vaultofsatoshi or cavirtex. They charge smaller margins than localbitcoin but it takes time, fees, and documentation to buy.
Good luck!

It makes sense to me because this thread has made me lose respect for cavirtex, imagine what it has done to the people who already didn't like you guys. You make a lot of open ended empty promises (or maybe they're not empty, but they were in the past) while repeating your passion for openness and transparency. This is the image you've given, probably not what you intended, but what's done is done. Move forward! You can still salvage this companies reputation but not until you actually show openness and transparency.

I listened to his talks years ago ( he is still saying the same thing only now he's not super excited about gold / silver going up like crazy (he was and he was wrong).

That was really confusing because I was switching between the username gold vs. my real name then I read your question

I'm happy with electrum. I have enough bitcoin clutter in my life so I'll stay away from armory even though it is probably very awesome.

It's just a payment method, not an additional marketplace that operates 24/7. These kind of statements are the reason exists

It's a big world and there needs to be a way to approach every sort of person, doge uses the fun / cheap method that bitcoin can't but in the end all cryptos win from increased participation. That's why upvoting either doge / btc is a good thing as long as the content speaks to the core message.

Thanks to overstock if someone announces plans to accept BTC and takes longer than a week they'll look disorganized and slow.

That sounds like what will happen so that your account is '[safeguarded](

The timing (i.e. being early) is relative to the life of Bitcoin. So if you get in now and Bitcoin lasts 1 more year then no you weren't early. If Bitcoin lasts 100 more years then yes you were early.

If this is a scam, hopefully coinbase uses their info on the user to perm ban them

All great points that I agree with, except I'd fight the urge to rush (i.e. do it properly &gt; do it quickly). Definitely move to high priority!

even though the risk is extremely high, the potential reward is even higher . But it is delusional to see a takeoff as 'inevitable'

For people wondering about all the downvotes, I'd guess it's because cavirtex_com is answering all the easy questions with repeated plugs on their new low fees while ignoring the tough but fair questions of frankros.
As an impartial observer I'm interested to see a good response to frankros. No conspiracy here.

You're right it wasn't a crash but this raises another question. If the fed is so evil like Mike implies, and the decline has been happening steadily while nothing has changed, what makes you think gold is getting ready for another run?

Yes that's exactly what I'm saying and that is what miners are mining for.

It's likely but Chase won't let us know the real reason other than 'safeguard' our accounts.

Maybe it could go towards building a reddit mobile app (long time coming) where can watermark a logo / link. That's like infinite advertising.

in short: "I was naive to hope that established payment history and 10 years history with Paypal would count for something. [...] When you accepted the PayPal User Agreement, you agreed to accept this decision as final and legally binding for this type of dispute."

bylls.com sounds cool but the price is a bit much at $3 per bill. If I'm out of options I'll give them a try
@_date: 2014-06-10 17:37:26
They gave it a fair shot with reddit gold. If it saved them (or earned them) as much money as we all had hoped they would have gone forward. They haven't.

I was on the phone with the Chase fraud department and they didn't seem interested since there was no fraudulent activity on my account. They welcomed me to contact the branch and let them know.  I was the 4th of the day to mention this scam to that branch so I didn't follow up since I'm sure they now know something is wrong.   
Sorry, no justice served :(

It's refreshing to see a company refute bitcoin adoption for understood and legitimate reasons.

Here's a tip for writing emails to CEOs of billion dollar companies: keep it short and to the point. 
I'd bet even here most people skipped the middle paragraphs of your email, sorry.

When is 'soon'? At least the evil banks (like Chase) give 2 months notice.

The first link says tigerdirect.com (not .ca) accepts bitcoin.  I wouldn't bother using bitcoin on their .ca until they make the .ca announcement formally.
@_date: 2014-05-28 17:34:11
I don't know what it's called but I'd like to pay to +some_nick_name instead of a long bitcoin address

There is plenty of room for competition in this billion dollar industry and early on a win for competition (i.e. coinbase) is a win for the entire industry.

First you have to address the deal that costco has made with American Express

No offense and I'm happy to see you keep your bitcoin but that mentality is basically buy high sell low. If you want to sell, which you did, it just got better to sell.

Two things that have become possible, for better or for worse, are the ability to perform peer-to-peer loans like at btcjam.com or one day the ability to crowd fund startups like at swarmcorp.com.

That is a great attitude. If you don't mind, I have an alternate suggestion to help the community even more. I see the bitcoin community as I do most R&amp;D departments: ridiculously talented with code but lacking in every other area. IMO the best way you can help is to partner up with a bunch of coders and give them direction, marketing, branding, UX, UI, runway, a business plan, anything but code.  
What are your strengths?

I had the branch manager on the phone so I would have had an easy time completing step 4. Also I'd like to think scammers would back off once called out.

Why are all the comments on coinbase so negative at  Do they really cancel purchase orders when the price shoots up as 'high risk' and then sell the BTC they bought for free profits? I'm worried because I have a pending order from last week and my cash has already left my account. 
edit: My purchase went through seamlessly, coinbase has my approval :)

It's a personal account. I was warned that my account looked like it was being used for business and if it wasn't primarily personal banking that they'd close it. It's because I sold a bunch on localbitcoins.com and wanted to buy back later, but now I've raised so many flags on my account I can't do anything without being closed down. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:00:35
That's exactly my concern. Why can't a windows client be safe enough for bitcoin? You can't expect windows user to move to linux
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:46:43
I had the misfortune of misplacing my password for a day and when it was locked I was informed that if I could not guess my own password the bitcoins are as good as lost. So if a good password is nearly impossible to break, why is all this security needed? Is it just incase someone keylogs me?
@_date: 2013-12-21 03:51:41
At least you can wire your money out, I'm with Chase and they first froze my account when I tried to add bitstamp as a wire recipient. The manager warned me they won't let me add bitstamp because bitcoin have something to do with drugs. I added my Canadian bank account as a wire recipient and now I can't even send it to myself because the chase wires have been down for a few days.
