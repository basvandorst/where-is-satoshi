Evil Central Bank urges to tax Bitcoin.
The purpose of EU is central power, propaganda, corrupted "justice" and heavy tax to micromanage our lives. 
Bitcoin and crypto are hope, evolution, freedom, justice... 
and the devil  starts to worry

Don't be mistaken this pole has absolutely no democratic purpose, on the contrary! 
It's a way to prepare their next  anti-crypto vicious propaganda 
I say "vicious" because they try to make it look like a debate where they would listen citizens (LOL). They try to not look like the evil guys (even though it's to late for many Europeans) by putting hard regulations. 
Anti-European political parties are raising very fast and, where i live, educated youth is majoritarily against EU. 
Look for example France creating a "working group" for regulating crypto. Who is in charge? former head of Bank of France! 
Once you realize that decentralization and transparency oppose all what EU is about...  
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:39:00
more people realize that now in Europe, particularly the youth. This "pole" is just a way to reach them and diffuse more pro-EU propaganda

It does make shorting easier. ANd it does increase the ratio of shorts/longs overall.  Does it have an effect on price? One would be stupid to say it has no effect or that because it is cash settled it has not effect. But the effects are more subtle than what we generally read on social medias
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:42:06
because their way of dealing with people is propaganda and trying to look good. If they had done hard regulation they would lose that. Anti-european parties are raising fast

i'm reading the discussion now, very interesting! 
Is this an example of how the derivatives could influence btc price could be?  the derivatives price goes lower than btc price but you know it will be a certain price in the future. So btc buyers would prefer to buy this derivative for a certain time and this would cause btc price to go down.

And it's barely enough to retire in some countries. 
Where I live 40-50% goes directly to tax then you get taxed more or less 30%every year on your income. If you want a risk-less income you choose something that gets you 2-3% a year. Minus inflation it's 1-2% and then  minus the tax you are left with $5000-10000 income per year
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:24:25
I haven't told you my country and yet you seem to know its laws better than me who just did research on them. What I wrote was my conclusion. And my friend just paid 50% tax on his one million gain.
Renting here is highly risky due to our laws.
Airbnb is extremely taxed and restricted.
The best risk free option four us is open a life insurance in Luxembourg with a return if 1-3 %  after inflation.
I feel talking to Obama lol
@_date: 2018-06-29 08:33:59
your list shows 60% in my country
i don't really care to be right actually, i just hope it's a lesson for you Hussein Obama
@_date: 2018-06-28 10:03:40
If you manage few Airbnb then that's not retirement. And not totally risk free. If you accept risk then you could keep some of your cryptos. The idea was to look at a risk free retirement. In my country your initial $1.4 million would be divided by almost two and make you lose free health care and other social advantages. You would be then heavily taxed. If you buy and rent apartments you can get 5% gain per year. That's approximately your numbers. But it's a job. If you leave it on a bank account you can't get more than 2%.
Also in my country Airbnb is very restricted. I know it's hell 
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:20:18
Yes I was answering the previous message. In the most optimistic case you could sell the BTC at the peak. Then you don't want to keep your fiat on the exchange. So you have to send the money to your bank. Here you get taxed on your gain. A friend did it when he reached one million and because of his job and family he prefered to stay in the country. He was taxed 50% and he's now in a higher tax group for years. You can't retire with that .
Maybe I misunderstood your message

This exchange is BS 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:04:46
My understanding: you can sell your BTC2 to USD or BTC, and  you can also exchange your BTC1+BTC2 with BTC. Some might prefer to do the last one depending on the prices and then they might need BTC2. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:24:41
by the way , what does it mean when the transaction is dropped from the mem pool?  how can it be sure?

No Bitfinex sells these tokens. If you understand the rules it's totally okay. There's no scam at all. If you don't understand then you should not try to play with them and just wait for the  fork and the real coins.

Mining is not really brute forcing a hash function. You just look for a hash smaller than a certain number, as fast as possible.

you're talking about decryption or mining? 
two different things
Your original post was about mining and Fenton112 answered. They can't do much more than double spending. I would add selfish mining as an other possible attack. But it's not going to "choke out" transactions as you wrote. They will just make more money at mining.
Decryption is an other area and we might have to make it more secure when quantum computers show up. Quantum computers won't be able to decrypt everything so no worry

I woul add that the receiver might want to wait for several confirmations (usually 6 to be sure) to avoid double spending.  He waits that his transaction is still in the main chain after 6 blocks. This adds one hour

True! Actually in a real case scenario Alice could pretend to be 2 different buyers, Jim and Joe, both buying the same item to Bob. She will pay only once . Jim and Joe both giving the correct address/key without having to look in the chain. So Bob should definitely ask for buyers public keys BEFORE payment. I think that's what merchant programs/clients do anyway.
