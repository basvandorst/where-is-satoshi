Don't the same people run shapeshift and a couple other exchanges that have extremely high rates?

Good find, anytime people tell you to leave a conspiracy theory alone your probably on the right track.

How do you recommend buying BTC with cash?
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:43:28
Im ok with my address being shown, I was hoping this thread would be about the .8 BTC that disappeared and how decentralization is lacking in giving end users any help. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:24:11
I hope your buying P2P and not paying fees or full price.

Decentralized means no rules, if bittrex doesn't have your money what will do? Make post on reddit? Im serious, what can you do?
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:33:50
I thought one of the beautiful things about bitcoin was that it couldn't be hacked, that you could give out your address without worry and that it was a currency.

I had to repost this because my address wasn't removed, I've contacted Jaxx numerous times with no explanation. So I decided maybe I can try reddit. Im sure not everyone has used Jaxx and this isn't about Jaxx. This post is about what action can be taken when errors arise.

If you only lost 8% on a transaction then you are doing great and should stick with that.
What I meant by CC is any personal info but it doesn't matter.

When I first learned of bitcoin, the people who introduced it me told me to change how I think about money. BTC to these people, was never going to be for payment at starbucks, BTC was to be used to buy your years worth of coffee beans from a coffee farmer P2P. Those people sounded crazy to me then.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:41:22
I thought when you used BTC giving out the address wasn't a big deal? You can leave it up if I get hacked maybe it will help people avoid the same mistake.

Smart kid good on her for using currency to get what she wants.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:51:47
As long as you do this in a decentralized environment you'll be fine. Decentralized means no rules or sense.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:33:05
I've never shown ID or used a credit card to obtain BTC. P2P with someone trustable and legit will change everything for you. After fees how close to $100 worth of BTC did you end up with?

What if crypto currency has been used by elites, banks, cartels, governments and religions for years before we masses had WIFI? How much would transporting $50,000,000 illegal cash across the world cost start to finish? The elites know that currency is a egregore and anything could be used as currency as long as its agreed upon by seller and buyer. So they devised a plan to skip all centralized banks, so that non of there dealing would be recorded. They agreed that 1000 units was worth a priceless work of art but 1,000,000 was worth a election.

If your a computer scientist or genius decentralization is a license to steal. God I hate being average and honest.

Yes I've used shapeshift a few times with that account. By scanning that QR code can you see my current balance? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:23:38
I hope you get your money back and I wasn't trying to sound like a asshole saying what are you going to do. I was all for decentralization until I realized that just means theres no rules or checks and balances. 
The only money I've lost  from crypto has happened because of errors from wallets or exchanges. If this was 2000 years ago we could join Jesus whipping the life out of this corrupt money changers. Now we can write a post hoping it matters but it doesn't. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:45:03
If I am breaking rules by showing my QR code I will erase it and Im sorry I didn't think of it. But Im not here looking for handouts. I just have no where else to turn to in trying to find a reason I have no record of a transaction for -.8 BTC
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:42:50
Have you found any emails to yourself with like 5 random words or passphrase? That's how I found a account that I forgot about. Also since you said bank instead of exchange people will try make you sound dumb and not worth helping.

Wasn't the government using block chain tech for years and used it as a payment for large amounts of illegal purchases for opium, cocaine and guns. Because moving that much cash was to expensive.
