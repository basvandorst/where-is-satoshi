How many people miss the point. Most people think its some kind of investment tool at this point.
@_date: 2016-08-13 23:14:13
I'd be interested to hear more on your last point. I've come to a different conclusion myself.
One of the prototypes for modern money was the system of IOUs that the rising artisinal class used to exchange created value amongst themselves in pre-renaissance times. Then the ruling class established a central bank and made it illegal to transact without bank-issued coin while establishing chartered monopolies -- state supported companies who were guaranteed a monopoly on an industry by law (think Dutch East India Company).
Crypto gives us a chance to try that prototype out again. And hopefully this time we can keep the banks out of it.
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:54:04
I guess what I'm trying to do is reinvent basic macroeconomics, then. My starting position is that the issuance of interest-bearing currency by a central bank tends to accumulate money in too few hands. When all money must be loaned out with interest to enter circulation, it enables those who already have money to make more passively by collecting interest, making wealth inequality a feature of our money system. I'm suggesting removing interest as a central defining aspect of money.  It would be backed by the capacity of it's users to create value and exchange the currency at an agreed upon rate. If that sounds a lot like a free market, it should. 
Also, you don't see any benefit to being able to alter the tax rate in real time? This would be our analog of the central bank's interest rate I suppose. We'd also be able to alter it independently of any third-party composed of humans? I understand that central banks control the interest rate with the overall good of the economy at hand, but they can't hope to be as reactive or predictive as a learning algorithm with excellent data.
I'm interested in what such a system would look like, what pitfalls it would have, whether it would even work in an ideal situation, where we manage to enact a currency without tying it to another currency and people begin with full trust in the currency. If it can't work in the ideal case then there's not much practical use in discussing it further, in my view. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 17:09:09
Thanks for clarifying, I knew it wasn't that simple.
@_date: 2016-08-16 06:55:35
Coinjoin requires a trusted third party to do the mixing, potentially compromising anonymity. Coinshuffle aims to do the mixing with a decentralized algorithm, i.e. on the client side, with no servers.
@_date: 2016-08-13 23:07:08
I see the bad name as a huge problem. Maybe I'm one of the naive ones, but I see a potential for bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general to redefine the way people transact. But that can't happen when the vast majority sees it as either a tool for financial speculation or criminal activity.

haha i like this guy ^^
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:53:00
yeah, but unless it's a transaction from one segwit address to another then it doesn't make much of a difference. it'll probably catch on at about the same rate as segwit adoption :/

Sell on an exchange that offers zero fees. GDAX and BitMex do this, and Bitflyer is currently running a promotion until the end of the month that allows for zero-fee trading.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:15:43
P sure you're being intentionally obtuse, but I'll spell it out anyway. Rational consumers don't expect net benefit to their bank account when they enter a casino, nor do they expect net benefit to their health when they enter a fast food restaurant. These are things irrational consumers do.
In other words, it's a mistake to treat everyone as a rational consumer.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:41:41
That would be true if somebody was interested from an entirely academic perspective. If you want to learn about the tech by using it, you're gonna need some bitcoin. It's why I bought in.

dude, fuck google. talk about centralization, jesus.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:34:12
You misunderstand. There were _no_ cryptographic signatures present in blocks being generated prior to the activation of segwit. Just lots of transaction hashes and a block header.
I need to read up on exactly how segwit blocks are structured, I know it's more complicated.

You mean those same fees you have to pay to send your bitcoin to the address associated with the debit card?
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:03:15
Yeah, I was way off base. For some reason was thinking the JSON description of blocks provided by my client were the blocks themselves. Am idiot, please make fun of me.

@_date: 2018-01-04 15:21:55
I've seen Wladimir van der Laan, the lead maintainer of bitcoin core, say that he thinks the bitcoin network follows the [law of induced demand]( Same thing happens with roads: traffic is terrible -&gt; add another lane to the highway (increase blocksize) -&gt; traffic is better -&gt; more people would rather drive (send tx) now -&gt; traffic is terrible again.
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:41:10
You're more correct than OP, but generally nobody talking about what Nietzsche actually meant is going to be 100% correct. Good on you for trying.

Have fun with that, LN deployment is gaining steam by the day. And given the relative ignorance of most of the market, this definitely has not been priced in yet.
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:59:15
Your point is that segwit will help clear the mempool gradually, resulting in low fees eventually. I'm saying it's possible, even likely, that won't happen because as the mempool clears, more people will take advantage of lower fees, putting us right back where we started (but with better tech). Not sure how that's irrelevant, but ok.
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:55:42
what a douche
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:28:34
As much as I hate this idea, it would likely be good for bitcoin. Depends on the perspective taken by the film, tho.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:36:04
Oh I send them, just for a very low fee. The wait continues.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:16:30
Because the fees are too high to send my coins to segwit addresses, duh.
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:07:53
You're kinda kidding yourself if you think that using a bitcoin debit card is allowing you to buy things with bitcoin. The only difference that I can see between using a btc debit card and selling on an exchange and using fiat is that btc debit cards force the user to hold their coins in a hot wallet controlled by some company. 
And I guess you'd have to actually plan out your expenses if you were using the second method, god forbid.
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:06:25

@_date: 2018-01-06 11:02:41
The only benefit I can see is that it allows you to hold onto your btc for longer. Not an entirely negligible benefit, I'll admit. But for me, this is outweighed by the cost you're paying in security.

They banned me just for being active on this sub. Not sure how they achieved this short of having a script dedicated to scanning the post history of subscribers and banning those who post in subs they don't like. Which would be fucking bonkers-level censorship.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:45:31
So you're saying a unit would have helped? How would this help any more than doing a duckduckgo search and spending 10 minutes reading about bitcoin? Wouldn't you rather the users of the network be better informed?
But no, surely continuing to lower the bar is the best course of action.

But when you buy shares Tesla isn't getting your money. You're just helping, in a very small way, to buoy the price of Tesla's stock, thus increasing their ability to raise revenue through stock sales and to take on more debt.
Similarly, when you buy bitcoin you're helping, in a very small way, to buoy the price of bitcoin, thus increasing the ability of bitcoin developers to fund their efforts (through the sale of bitcoin) to build out and optimize the technology, making it easier for people to use.
You may be ignoring the financial freedom that bitcoin grants those who have devoted their life to improving it.

It makes perfect sense to me that anybody smart enough to create something as radically new as bitcoin would also be smart enough to know that public exposure would be a deathknell for the their creation. I think Hal is/was smart enough to know this, too.

But seriously, you seem to underestimate the added risk represented by mounting CC debt. No, credit card debt won't be the catalyst that triggers the collapse, but if some other factor causes millions to be unable to service their CC debt, it could sure as hell be a reagent.

I grabbed a recent block from my node, [see for yourself.]( It's just the txid that's included in the block.
You may be right about the mempool not being involved tho, I forget exactly how transaction included in the block are looked up by validating nodes. Was pretty tired when I made that post, perhaps I meant the utxo set. Would love it if you could explain how the transactions in the block are confirmed valid, it's been a while since I read that chapter.
edit: ok, maybe I'm misunderstanding how blocks are interpreted by the software, because the text contained in that block is only 147KB of data.

It's a test transaction for my new trezor, to a segwit address. The wait continues.
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:08:18
Here's an educational experiment: if you use an exchange, send them a small amount of btc, withdraw it to your personal wallet, and then look at the fee attached to the withdrawal transaction.
While there are wallets that will force people to overpay for fees, this effect likely pales in comparison to the volume of transactions being sent by exchanges with ultra-priority fee rates (because they'd just get bombarded by customers asking why their transaction hasn't confirmed yet if they didn't).
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:41:31
They don't even need to adapt. They just need to learn SI prefixes, which I _thought_ the whole world outside the U.S. was already down with. But what would I know, I'm just a pissed off American who's watching people actively flee a sensible unit system.

@_date: 2018-01-05 09:46:56
Totally, that's why I said that we end up with better tech after the cycle is completed. But it's important to understand this effect, because this is why solutions like simply raising the blocksize are a bad idea.
This cycle should continue as long as bitcoin is growing. Right now it's looking like LN is going to be the next major improvement to throughput, and I'm sure we'll end up in a high-fee on-chain equilibrium yet again after instant, low-fee off-chain transactions attract even more bitcoiners.
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:54:41
Good points, I don't support the "microdecisions" narrative either. I do think, however, that we can attribute some of the historical dismissal or bitcoin by the public-at-large to a lack of personal empowerment. I can't count the number of people I've talked to who had heard about bitcoin years ago, were computer literate, yet made no moves to to acquire any at all.
If you don't have a computer or know how to use one, bitcoin just isn't really for you. Not sure how bitcoin is supposed to help people who can't use it. At least today, that is. Decentralized autonomous organizations have great potential to help society at large in the future, but that's still a ways off.

@_date: 2018-01-05 09:35:28
Yeah, not a bad outcome. But arguing that segwit will decrease fees is kinda short-sighted.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:57:11
Yeah, that's also a problem. I like to hope that an increase in the value of bitcoin would push down the equilibrium fee price (in satoshis), but that's a pretty complex equation to model, and it doesn't appear to be happening on ~month timescales.

Sounds like you're arguing for increasing bitcoin's compatibility with the existing financial system. Some hodler you are. Bitcoin exists to make this system irrelevant, not to cozy up to it.
We've been presented with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to change the way that people think about money. You'd be willing to throw that away for convenience?
Besides, "bit" isn't confusing because it's a computer science term, it's confusing because it's not at all clear from the name how much bitcoin you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:05:16
Is anyone else getting tired of this whole topic? Use whatever units you want. Bitcoin is about freedom, and that includes freedom from other peoples' way of naming things. I'll continue using the entirely sane and universally understandable "millibit" and "microbit." They even have ready-made symbols, courtesy of the SI prefix system: mBTC and uBTC (a compromise since "mu" is difficult to type).

Oh, so you mean an ATM that both services bank accounts and provides crypto &lt;-&gt; fiat swaps. Yeah, that'd be pretty rad. Not sure what the long-term use case would be, though. Aren't crypto wallets supposed to replace banks? Or at the very least, make them irrelevant?

Even if they implement segwit, they need to drop their hardcoded fees. 200 sat/WU is better than 200 sat/byte, but not by much.

This is why I said CC-*related* fees, meaning the ones charged by Coinbase. Thanks for playing.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:23:40
I can already scan a QR code on my phone and have bitcoin zapped onto it by any bitcoin ATM. Fortunately, they usually place bitcoin ATMs in close proximity to traditional ATMs, so it doesn't seem like too great of an inconvenience.
Tbh I prefer using separate machines anyway, as this implies that there isn't one organization who has *all* of my transaction data. Decentralization ftw.

I have no problem using "mils" or "mikes." Used in the context of bitcoin, the these truncations make much more sense to me than "bit," which could refer to any denomination.

Different types of knowledge, my friend. 
Knowing how to find things out on the internet is, believe it or not, an acquired skill (as evidenced by the hordes of redditors who insist on asking easily searchable questions). I'd say this type of knowledge is much closer to old school "street knowledge" than the "book knowledge" that the previous poster's colleagues likely possess.

So, you think that 0.33L bottle has exactly 0.33L of liquid in it? Or that a 1.74m tall person is exactly that tall? It's called rounding, and we already do it every day. Hell, even scientists do it using significant figures, which is a direct acknowledgement that not all of the decimal places are important for every calculation.
Nothing stopping anyone from rounding to 0.42BTC or 0.99mBTC or 0.48uBTC.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:42:14
That's one take on it. Another is that the legitimacy granted to bitcoin -- and by extension, the entire cryptocurrency space -- by even being discussed at a G20 summit will convince a new wave of investors that this is something worth owning. Bullish signs, my friend.

Yes, but it requires you to achieve consensus within the community for it to even make sense. Good luck with that. We don't need to mess with denominations for bitcoin to gain mass appeal as a currency. 0.001 bitcoin = 1 millibit = 1000 microbits. Not that hard.

As the overall crypto space expands, bitcoin can become devalued due to an increase in comparable substitutes. You don't even need altcoins for this to happen, you can simply print new tokens on bitcoin sidechains.

Certain coins can be "blacklisted" after being involved in known criminal activity, but coin tumblers, miner fees, etc. will ultimately return all this marked bitcoin to the the general supply over time. So yeah, its pretty fungible.

It's losing value due to an increased monetary base. So, inflation.
This is one of the things I love about bitcoin. It challenges our classical economic notions of terms. Common usage of these terms implicitly assumes a closed monetary base with few players who can expand or contract it. That paradigm is beginning to shift.
@_date: 2018-05-16 08:11:15

While I agree that the simple aesthetics of Unix are appealing, I'm seriously skeptical that we could have gotten the majority of the human population on board with using command prompts. That would be nice, for sure, but our society doesn't provide for changes in education that quickly (bummer).
As someone younger than yourself whose first PC ran Windows 95, I'm not sure I would have ever gotten into computers if I couldn't easily navigate to a website and play shitty flash games based on my favorite cartoons. It's a question of accessibility vs. control IMO. As computers become more accessible, users have less control of their systems (and they'll care less about such things).
It scares me when I think of this happening to bitcoin.

There's nothing preventing bitcoin from becoming inflationary after all coins have been mined.
Personally, I think the idea of having an "ultimate currency of the future" is a bit silly, and at least antithetical to the rise of [cryptoanarchy]( (see section 16.4.2 for a short manifesto). Has there been any time and place in history where a single currency was in use without a single competitor? If that were to happen, what would prevent people from creating their own community-based currencies?
What's wrong with many currencies, each having different properties and able to be swapped with minimal friction?

You're right, Google isn't a one trick pony. Most of the people who work there, I think, believe in the open source ethos and genuinely want to make the world a better place through code. I'm less sure about the people who run the show, however.

I give BTC away to anybody I meet who's both willing to download a wallet and doesn't already have some. Network effect is important, and one day that $10 I send them may be enough for them to give somebody else $10 while holding on the bulk of their stash. Pay it forward, ya know?

That's what I remember happening. Also, the software only used 3 hardcoded bitcoin addresses, so there was no technically possible way to determine if the bitcoin had been paid by any specific victim.

Coinbase uses ACH to transfer money to your bank.
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:23:35
This just isn't technically accurate. If you're talking about politics, please be clear that's what you're doing.
A hard fork occurs whenever the network disagrees on a single block. They happen quite frequently, actually, and are usually resolved by the next block by bitcoin's consensus mechanism. A. Antonipolous' Mastering Bitcoin has a good explanation of this process.
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:49:46
Ok, sorry, you're right. There was some kind of contact feature that was active until the email address it linked to was blocked by the provider. That's what was used to unencrypt some victim's data. I shouldn't make technical posts this late.

Not sure I would go that far, but I'm prepared to make a weaker claim. Google is interested in control, and if they can't control bitcoin then they won't legitimize it by publicly working with it. There is much internal discussion of bitcoin in Google, and they have bitcoin devs come and give talks frequently.

I set my fees based primarily on the state of the mempool when i send my transaction. Mempool smaller than or near blocksize --&gt; very low fee, 10 sat/byte. If its more, then just use fees on the lower end of transactions that were included in the last block.
Not an algorithm exactly, but then the problem here is that all currently existing fee algorithms suck and can't deal with edge cases.

To be fair, at one point the moderator went around and asked each participant if they "thought it would be good for bitcoin if Roger endorsed SegWit."
That's a pretty clear example of a leading question, and I think it's understandable that Roger would be irked by this line of questioning. If somebody asked all of your friends if they thought it would be good for the group if you broke up with your spouse, how would you feel?

You have a point on the the vagueness of "bitcoin merchant," I mean merchants who accept bitcoin for goods and services. But that's a bit of a mouthful. I'm open to suggestions.
You also make a good point about Bitpay's business model, it's not ideal. But if it gets merchants used to the idea of accepting bitcoin, this may be a price worth paying. After all, it's unreasonable to expect every entrepreneur to have the time to educate his/herself on the best security practices for storing and transacting with bitcoin. With time, and more accessible key management software, I believe this can change.
edit: I have an anecdote relevant to Bitpay's business model and future prospects. I recently bought a bitcoin keychain from a merchant and paid through Bitpay. I soon received an email from the merchant informing me that, due to errors on Bitpay's end, he was unable to access the invoices for sales he had made. I told him that I was able to access the invoice, so it did indeed exist and was correct. The merchant asked if I would be willing to send him the URL of the invoice, which I refused, given that I do not know how these URLs are generated (this _could_ involve hashing personally identifiable info). He understood.
Moral of the story: Bitpay is fucking up and this merchant took notice. Given that I received the keychain, the likelihood of this merchant being a scammer is low.

I've been trying my darnedest to keep abreast of the issue, but things have gotten very polarized at this point. That's what I was getting at with my comment.
Yes, the issues are very important. But the way we talk about the issues may be just as important. And maybe that's means _not_ assuming that someone who doesn't agree with you needs to be lectured and condescended to. Just my take, cuz I've been seeing a lot of that lately.

The hashing algorithm isn't random, it produces pseudorandom values. Collision resistance for the hash function implies that this pseudorandom number is indistinguishable from random (if it weren't, then this non-randomness could be exploited to find a collision). If you keep hashing a value and producing these values which are indistinguishable from random, eventually you will get a value below the difficulty target, due to the definition of randomness.
And if I'm wrong about that, you can always just swap the order of a couple transactions.

There's a sizable camp of folks, myself included, who _never_ wanted to see a rushed blocksize increase. The impetus for me is to reduce unpredictability, maximize safety, and to hash out the economic consequences (to the best of our abilities).

If anybody has different reasons why they don't support a rushed blocksize increase (or any other hard fork), please chime in.

Sounds rad! I don't mean to put down your effort, which is clearly considerable. If I were you I'd just focus on the price part of it, might be doing too much with all the portfolio stuff. If you can just come up with a platform that's hands-down better than coinmarketcap, that's already a big win.

Yes, it's more than enough to both play games with the price and bring other things down with it. These are both things that gox did in spectacular fashion.

That's a shitty argument. The land has the value we give it, there's nothing intrinsic behind it beyond the fact that the value-assessors occupy physical space. If there were no people to give the land value, it would just be land.
As long as people exist, they'll need land to live on. As long as people exist (and they haven't invented anything better), they'll need bitcoin to store value securely in an easily transferable medium. I suppose there's some irony in the thought that the total abstraction from physical space is part of what gives bitcoin its value, in contrast to what gives land value.

@_date: 2017-11-11 07:48:18
This believing vs. not believing reduction is why I don't support the "dumbing down" of bitcoin at all. Here we have a singular opportunity to create conditions which incentivize large portions of the population to stop what they're doing and learn how to do something for themselves, and learn how to function in a trustless economy. Let's not squander this in the name of adoption.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:40:56
That's one theory. Another is that they would rather throw money at transaction fees than have to deal with thousands of customer emails of the type "My transaction isn't confirming, what gives?"

Well that's cool that you reject the politics of bitcoin and all. We don't really need you to advance the cause. Random discussions on public forums are how ideas spread, dude.

You can't send a stock or a bond directly to a peer without the use of a third party. You can do this with bitcoin. I'd say that provides a pretty big advantage in liquidity as volume increases.
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:04:15
Well, I try and give bitcoin away to people whenever possible, preferably to my broke-ass friends. I see it as a form of wealth redistribution from the investor class to the working class, albeit very slowly and with small amounts of money (I usually send em the equivalent of $10). Gotta make your own change, right?
I agree that miners are entitled to the value that their labor has produced. I don't owe them anything other than the fees I pay, though.
I wish I had a better answer for your final question, but really I don't think I'm that great of a communist. In one of my other replies I said I wished I had titled this post "Are there any other supporters of communist/socialist ideals?" A true Marxist would likely have nothing to do with bitcoin.

It's up to the individual to decide how much they want to learn and contribute to the network.

This is the same argument that the bcashers use to bash Blockstream. It's backed but nothing but paranoia and a misunderstanding of the protocol.

Welll, if you're down to get a bit more abstract with it, bitcoin enables transactions to take place between parties that would traditionally be unable to transact. This mutually beneficial trade should generate more wealth for both parties, in theory.
Did bitcoin generate the wealth? Not really, but the wealth wouldn't have been generated without bitcoin.

Untrue. Bitcoin adds value by decreasing the friction of transactions, and it furthermore introduces a novel system of governance: a flat network topology that allows for a sort of panoptic sousveillance. This novel structure has value in itself, as it can be applied to all sorts of governing bodies; this is only made possible by a highly connected common class who are able to identify and bat down any who would take an outsized chunk of power for themself (I'm looking at you, Ver).

To expand on the fee point, the fees to open and close channels will still be based on the size of the commitment to the blockchain. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but when using eclair on testnet the commitments to open and close channels were about the same size as an average P2SH tx.

And yes, telling people not to mail bombs because people might be hurt is an appeal to morality. Just like telling them not to mail bombs to avoid federal prison is an appeal to fear.

Really, isn't up to each of us to share resources when we find them, instead of complaining about how there's no good resources? These aren't strictly about the codebase; but really, if you want to be working with the codebase then isn't github gonna be the best place to start? This is a meritocracy, if you can't hack it then get out of the way so others can (and there's no shame in getting out of the way!).

You're reading an awful lot into the intentions of Bitcoin's creator. Unless you have quotes, I'm skeptical. Even so, the intent of the creator has little bearing on the political effect of the network and the purposes for which it will be used after the creator has disappeared. There are echoes, sure, but a lot has changed in 9 years.

Whales gonna whale. If you think the price on exchanges isn't being actively manipulated by millionaires on a daily basis, you're a fool. I was watching some dude post and remove 250 BTC buy/sell orders last night. No idea why he was posting orders for over $2m, but they weren't having much effect (volume at the time was too low). I think the simplest explanation (and therefore most likely correct by Occam's Razor) is that many whales are just as dumb as you and me. Only difference is they have the power to make the price fluctuate rapidly with their stupidity.
Just ride it out, man.

No, increasing the addresses used increases the number of inputs, which increases the transaction size, which increases the associated fee. Addresses are inputs and must be recorded in the transaction.
However, I find the suggestion that majority hashpower will mine 2x laughable, so I'm good, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:36:48
I'm not sure where you're getting the idea of USDT "disappearing." 
What I'm imagining is the most likely scenario is some damning news coming out about tether, initiating a mass panic sell for BTC and alts, which temporarily drives up the price of BTC, followed by further panic selling of BTC and alts as noobs try to get their money out of crypto. Could be an excellent trade, don't blink.

You're right, this is like the 3rd time I've made this specific mistake (utxos vs addresses).

I started out on that sub actually, feel free to go waaaay back in my post history to verify. I was seduced by the anti-authoritarian (the authority in this case being the core devs), anti-censorship siren song. It took a good deal of self-education, experimentation, earnest perusal of the bitcoin-dev mailing list, and most importantly, _positive interaction with this community_ to convince myself that these open source weirdos are really the best we've got.
I can surmise that there are others who are currently in the situation that I found myself in, and that treating them with suspicion and distrust will only serve to entrench their anti-authoritarian leanings.

The big-shot bankers saw it coming, they just knew that they'd be bailed out. That doesn't affect the rest of your argument tho, the point is they can't be trusted. But it is important not to underestimate your enemy. And let's be clear, banks (not necessarily the people who run them, but the institutions) _are_ the enemy. 
States depend on banks for their continued existence, and so will enforce acts which support banks. But banks are the problem, not their supplicant states.

The reason it's scary when your cab driver gives you tips is you know that many other cab drivers are doing the same thing. More cab drivers than there are celebrities.

You didn't mention a possible centralization of LN hubs, which is one of the few points rbtc'ers make that has some weight to it. Could end up creating central failure points in the network, which is bad. IMO worth it for increased capacity tho.

Wait a minute, this doesn't jibe with my understanding. How can a node automatically open channels when a BTC deposit must be used to open a channel? Does the user just specify an amount of BTC to use opening channels, but not to what address the channels will be opened?

Coinbase and GDAX are the same company, no difference in terms of safety (think: will my coins get hacked?), just in terms of financial risk. If you have a coinbase account, you have a GDAX account. GDAX has a lower fee model to attract more savvy investors, the noobs using coinbase.com pay the extra fee for the security of knowing how much BTC they're getting when they begin the fiat transfer. With GDAX, you must make the transfer, wait 4-5 days, and then buy at whatever the price is then. 
However, you can buy on coinbase, pay the fee, transfer to GDAX, and then get a zero-cost tx fee to transfer to a wallet you control (they subsidize the fee to promote the platform). I like coinbase precisely because they provide so many options for how to buy and sell. Sometimes it's worth taking the fee hit if you believe BTC will skyrocket tomorrow. Sometimes it can go the other way. Nice to have options, is all.

I called em, it was a bit old-fashioned. A nice lady with an east coast accent explained that they have a "bitcoin cash processing unit," so to make a deposit you call their customer service line, they contact their bitcoin cash people (I'm guessing one or two dudes in a room somewhere) who then send over a deposit address and an exchange rate that's valid for 30 minutes, and then you have 30 minutes to complete the deposit, at which time your account balance is credited. You can then withdraw the balance via bitcoin, or wire transfer if you have the minimum $1500. Pretty neat.

Why that would lead you to believe that anything other than a radical transformation of the global landscape is currently underway, I don't really understand.
Regarding transparency: everything done natively in crypto is by default transparent, it's all recorded on whatever blockchain you're using. Ironically, it's the shady corners of the existing system that provide the cover for these bad actors. I say fuck the existing system, let it crumble under it's own weight.

I lol'd at "hard asset." Dollars are a hard asset too, ya know. Harder than bitcoin, some might argue.
I think our main point of contention is that you respect the boundaries and definitions that the legacy financial system has established and I do not.
The term "concert" is also conventional, but that doesn't stop people from using it to describe a weird set of noise music in an alley by the highway patrol station, powered by a generator. Culture defines language and vice versa. If people want to call these kiosks bitcoin ATMs, then guess what, that's what they are.
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:04:37
You seem to forget that the legacy financial system has all of these same problems. Shit, we wouldn't even know the half of it without the hard work of the journalists behind the Panama/Paradise papers ([at least one of whom paid for this information with her life!]( Consensus enforcing independently verifiable ledgers would have made their jobs much easier, and likely more safe)
To people who complain about criminal activity in the crypto space, I ask why they'd rather focus on this than the rampant criminality in the existing, far-greater-in-scale, system. I suspect that scams and fraud are simply part and parcel of any cash-based economy. You're not going to get rid of them or even slow them down considerably, you're only going to make the scammers and fraudsters more sophisticated and harder to detect.
Also, I feel like when you use the word "investors" in this context you should include a disclaimer saying you really mean "banks." As a retail investor, I could give a flying fuck about the situation my exchange is in. As long as they can handle my bitcoin for the hour it takes for me to transfer it, wait 6 confirmations, and sell it, they could be funding the propaganda arm of the Russian state for all I care (I'd actually view this as an added bonus). The less information they're reporting to the IRS the better AFAIC

If you can give me a reason that a teller MUST serve as the access point to some account handled by a third party organization other than convention, I'll reconsider. But I don't think that's really possible, because your argument is founded on convention. A bit ironic that you're trying so hard to apply convention to an entirely unconventional asset.

@_date: 2017-05-20 19:17:07
Yes, that would be nice in a perfect world. But sometimes software is buggy. In these cases we must fall back on our understanding of the bitcoin protocol to determine the best course of action. For example, I've had a transaction to shapeshift hanging unconfirmed for a few weeks now due to a low fee. I have the option of raising the fee with a replace-by-child transaction, or I can just wait for the transaction to be cleared from the mempool.
However, since the transaction has not yet been cleared from the mempool after two weeks, I'm assuming that either my client (Electrum) or shapeshift on their end are rebroadcasting the transaction, keeping it hanging in the mempool. If this is the case, the transaction will just hang around until fees drop enough for miners to include this low fee transaction in a block. No skin off my back.
tx for reference:

You seem awfully concerned with the interpretations of states and legacy financial institutions when discussing the properties of bitcoin. This is confusing to me.
I prefer to work from first principals. An ATM is an automated teller machine. A bitcoin ATM is certainly an automated machine, but is it a teller? From dictionary.com, the relevant definition is:
n. a person employed in a bank to receive or pay out money over the counter.
Leaving aside the bank employee bit, as that doesn't apply here, a teller is a person or thing which receives and pays out money. Thus, bitcoin ATMs clearly satisfy the definition of an ATM without bringing in appeals to authority.
The provenance and destination of the money transacted seems, to me, to be entirely irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:21:59
To add to the other commenters, one of bitcoin's greatest strengths is that things like this can be done. It makes it resistant to bad actors on network. Not sure anybody is going to care much about the definition of bitcoin as long as they can spend it. Care to define a dollar for me?
@_date: 2017-05-20 19:36:58
Network effect and length of time running without serious interruption are the two biggest ones. 
Network effect is crucial, it speaks to the number of people who have already gone through the trouble of downloading the necessary software and educating themselves to the point where they are able to buy and hold bitcoin, a nontrival barrier to entry.
Length of time running without interruption (read: immutability) is arguably even more important than this. It speaks to the security of bitcoin. It's been running practically uninterrupted, with no cases of protocol subversion, for over 8 years, and for much of this time there's been a multi-billion dollar bug bounty for anyone capable of finding a flaw in the bitcoin protocol. The fact that nobody has claimed this bounty is perhaps the single biggest contributor to bitcoin's continued value.
Please note I'm not agreeing with the premise of your question, that bitcoin is 'superior'. I'm just outlining a couple reasons that bitcoin's _value_ is presently and historically higher than that of any other coin.

Dude have you ever been part of a complex tech project? Others in this thread have used phrases like "swamped" and "running in place to stand still." Allow me to add my own colorful metaphor.
You come into work at the beginning of the day to find everything on fire. "Well, that can't be good," you say and immediately get to work. 10 hours of furious work later you find that everything is still on fire, but now you need to sleep. So you go home and repeat the next day.
Shit breaks often, especially when scaling. This is fine, everything is fine.
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:17:28
IANAL, but I'm pretty sure you do own them in a legal sense, seeing as coinbase has your personally identifiable information on record and both parties are provided with proof of payment. You're correct in that you don't control the private key that is capable of sending the bitcoin you've purchased from coinbase until you've transferred it from your coinbase wallet.

The best (and only truly substantial) way is to run a full node supporting BIP148. If that is beyond your capabilities or financial means, don't worry about it.
Spreading knowledge about bitcoin is how I resolve myself to contributing to the network, as I don't have the $$ to spare for new hardware, and my laptop that cost $500 4 years ago (with a 500 GB HDD) isn't quite going to cut it.

It really bugs me how often these kinds of disparagements are brought up in such a highly active and fluid space. My own opinions on what's best for the future of bitcoin were not identical to what they were a month ago.
Asking anyone to be completely consistent with their opinion when it comes to cryptocurrency would be asking them to ignore the overwhelming amount of new developments that occur on a weekly basis, and would also discourage those who wish to more fully form their views.
I realize that businesses in the space are held to a higher standard, but I see no reason to suspect foul play based on the statements provided.
Disclaimer: I take the long view and happen to think they're correct. Bitcoin (and human projects in general) need diversity and conflict to become stronger. If you don't buy that, then buy the security argument: immutability is more important than throughput.

Nobody has lost their bitcoin as the result of a protocol breach, so yes. As a store of value it's still working great. A few months to wait for UASF isn't too long considering we've been mired in this debate for about a year now.
But really, time will tell what the market considers more valuable: immutability or network throughput. Right now it seems like people, by and large, are pretty happy with immutability.

I've gotten my hands on their current build, and while the tech shows amazing promise, it's still preeeetty janky. I've had no problem with any of the wallet features though, just some hiccups with downloading and displaying content (also no easy way to search for content in the GUI). However there doesn't seem to be an obvious way to recover your wallet, which is a bit concerning.

The main impediment to that package being released is getting it through the core dev team (a poor name for a bunch of guys loosely associated through an email list and github). They make the calls on what gets included in bitcoin core, and if they don't agree that a proposal is technically sound then it never gets off the ground. And if they do agree that it might be technically sound they spend months arguing about it and hashing out the details. There's just so much the layman (including myself here) doesn't understand about the protocol.
And why might BIP148 be better? Well, it'll probably be activated sooner lol. Maybe not better, but it's what we get now that the cogs have been set in motion.

The thing is, as long as bitcoin remains secure, no other coin will be able to provide the same level of _proven_ security as bitcoin. They simply haven't had as much time to prove themselves out.

I was stretching it, sure. I just mean that the random nature of the amount of time it takes for a hash with the requisite number of leading zeroes to be found is desirable. I'm not a cryptologist but it seems to me that the randomness of the algorithm is what protects it from attack. If the PoW were not perfectly random (i.e. if there were some way to know a priori that some inputs will NOT yield the desired hash) then there would likely be more attack vectors. Funny, that sounds like what ASICboost does...
Interesting to think about, is ASICboost a PoW improvement or an attack on the network? It would be one thing if it was open-source technology. I'm not sure I have the proper language to describe this, but it seems to me like trying to implement unfree, patented technology on a free, open-source network should be considered incompatible with the network protocol. Strange how notions of the relative freedom of software should be conflated with network attacks.
Kinda ended up rambling there, just wanted to explore that thought a bit.

Good post, but wrong on one technical detail. Signaling for SW ends on Nov. 1 per the original SW BIP (forget the number). Aug. 1 is when signaling for BIP 148 ends.
And this isn't to say that the threshold for miner activation couldn't be lowered between then and now. As I understand, this is possible but highly unlikely given the hurdles it would need to clear in the core dev team.

That's the thing, I don't think BTC market dominance has much to do with it. Bitcoin is the "brand" of the crypto market space, love it or hate it. That brand, while it's affected by the the relative value of bitcoin in some hard-to-define way, is definitely not _only_ determined by that. In a lot of ways, the cryptocurrency space is still defined by bitcoin, and for this to change would require a sea change of public opinion, not just a shift in BTC dominance.

I don't disagree, but the previous poster asked for a _promise_, and I believe this word is crucial to their point.

That's assuming the value of bitcoin holds constant after a fork.
Another possible scenario is that you have $100 worth of bitcoin pre-fork, and afterwards you have $70 worth of bitcoin and $20 worth of bitcoin cash.
You have to ask yourself what defines the value of these coins. With an inelastic supply of money flowing into and out of cryptocurrencies, I think it's much more likely that any chain split would see a consequent split in value.
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:10:55
It's not just coinbase, it's any other party controlling the private keys which unlock the bitcoin you purchased. If the private keys are stored on a computer, they can be recovered by an attacker, and if the computer those keys are stored on is a highly visible target, such as an online exchange, there will be many attackers attempting to access those private keys. The exchange may have better (network) security practices than you, but their attack surface is also much, MUCH larger.
Don't trust exchanges with your bitcoin.

This attitude really surprises me from a lot of people. All this hate-slanging, calling any coin you don't support SHITCOIN. It's seemed to me from the beginning that what's good for one coin is good for every coin. While I understand the tribal mentality, it's always seemed to me that there's too much penetration between coins for this to matter. How many of us are hodlers of bitcoin and several other cryptos?
It doesn't matter if you support smart contracts, anonymity, PoW or PoS. It's all variations on a theme, man.

I should probably go back and say that I don't mean to undervalue the contributions of exceptional figures, they do play key roles in the larger scheme. But if the world, or society, or the collective consciousness, or whatever you want to call it isn't ready for the ideas espoused by these exceptional figures, then they'll be relegated to obscurity.
In short, the thing that makes these figures exceptional is being in the right place at the right time with the right ideas. So luck, more than talent or skill or whatever.

My answer isn't very satisfying, and it's just that it's more complicated than that and I don't claim to understand it completely. Bitcoin can't realistically reach a 5% market share if people still consider it the face of cryptocurrencies. People's expectations determine the price when you're talking about a speculative asset like this. So at the point where people have lost faith in bitcoin, or the "brand" of bitcoin, then it will relinquish market dominance. Until then, it's like asking at what market cap dominance % will silver or platinum overtake gold. Gold is gold, and it's special to people because its gold (and cuz of its neat properties). It doesn't necessarily make sense, but anybody who tells you that markets are rational is a fibber.
This could be caused by a variety of things, like an unexpected or contentious fork, or a sustained attack, or a technological breakthrough from one of the alts. At the point when it's happening, you won't be wondering whether it's happening. There will be hordes of people crying apocalypse all over this sub.

Sorry, slight correction. The BIP 141 signaling period doesn't end until Nov. 15th. The only thing happening for sure on Aug 1 will be BIP 148 nodes refusing to relay non-BIP 141 transactions. BIP 141 still has several months after this to lock in on either chain.

No... The litecoin developers released a version of the core client which implemented segwit, then 75% of the miners signaled for activation, and following a 2016 block fallow period segwit was activated on the litecoin network.
AFAIU, implementing segwit on litecoin was trivial in terms of developer resources because the litecoin codebase is so similar to bitcoin's.

I'm sorry but I just don't share your views on the importance of Bitcoin market dominance. The price of all of the alts are, at one time or another, pegged to the price of bitcoin. On average, the crypto market reflects what bitcoin is doing. Now, whether this is bitcoin affecting alts or alts affecting bitcoin, is hard to say. I suspect a more complex interplay of market forces is at work, and that this is _good_ for bitcoin and the cryptocurrency sphere in general. Resiliency, redundancy, reliability, all those nice 'R'-words.
If fees rise too high on bitcoin, people can trade their litecoin for small purchases and use bitcoin for larger transactions (plenty of people started doing this when the fees got out of control). I just don't see how this is bad for bitcoin in the long run. If anything, I claim the fact that ["bitcoin don't care"]( about what any individual group of users might want is good for the immediate and long-term value of bitcoin (and thus alts as well).

At least some of that cash makes it back into your community in the form of payroll checks. When you buy from Amazon you're just sending money into the void of Amazon's balance sheet. If you insist on online shopping, Overstock accepts bitcoin. I bought a bath mat from them with bitcoin not long ago.

I think the second argument is much stronger. It's a shame you just glossed over it. 
Spending habits change over time, and someone can (and likely will) increase their purchase amount if they see an opportunity, just as they can decrease their purchase as money becomes tight.

Hmmm, for sure. 
Maybe this is a naive question, but if bitcoin is treated as an asset the same way a car is treated as an asset, how would this create an obligation for a stolen asset to be returned? Would the government be obligated to return precisely the coins that were stolen (obviously infeasible) or would they be allowed to treat it as a fungible, replaceable asset and return a sum of coins equal to the amount stolen? I'm probably missing something, but this seems murky to me.

I support the core idea of this message, in that BIP148 represents a _last resort_ that the community is using to activate segwit on the bitcoin network. This should _not_ be viewed as a desirable outcome: by far the safest way in terms of network stability is a Miner Activated Soft Fork (MASF). However, in the interest activating an upgrade strongly desired by the community, and recent developments (segwit2x) I support the continued signaling of BIP148.
I don't, however, support the conclusion that Jihan, Roger Ver, or _any_ one group or alliance of interests is responsible for the apparent failure of the MASF (BIP141). There is no concrete proof, nor can there ever be concrete proof barring intensive forensic analysis of the IP records of miners who are not signaling for activation of BIP141 (if any miners are using Tor, even this is not possible). So while we may have high confidence that certain actors are behaving badly, it is not fair to blame just these actors.
The bitcoin network is both a technology and a collaborative, experimental learning process. Every user is permitted to run the bitcoin software in any way they want, and this is one of the greatest strengths of the bitcoin network (of course if the user makes changes which aren't consensus-compatible their node may run into issues interacting with the network). The fact that a group of users can so effectively delay an upgrade is a testament to the strength of bitcoin; we should celebrate these users for exercising their rights, not demonize them for disagreeing.
In closing, I offer this thought experiment: what if the tables were turned and bitcoin's economic consensus now leaned towards the side of centralized governance, and this consensus was trying to activate an upgrade devolving some of bitcoin's decntralized properties. In this scenario, the core dev team has been "fired" (disbanded) and the future of bitcoin is a bleak corporate wasteland. Would the existence of a UASF be desirable in this case? Or would we want to figure out a safer way of upgrading by then, one which is more resistant to social engineering?

It's a free market bubble. Using the dot com bubble as an analog: many altcoins will go belly up (ask jeeves and others), some will be subject to swift government reprisal (the napsters of the crypto space) and a lucky few will be unimaginably successful (google, microsoft, etc.).
Markets operate in cycles. First the swell, then the break, then the drawback. Rinse and repeat. Not sure why it's anything to worry about.
I'd guess the timescale of the current cycle will be ~3 years, but the way things have been accelerating lately I wouldn't be surprised if we saw these developments play out more quickly.

I remember watching the aftermath of the ETH split, and the data definitely backs up your thesis. But then look at what happened to the price of ETH not one year after the split.
I think that your analysis is probably accurate in some time frame after the split (maybe 6 months-ish?), but after that we begin to see the prices of the two forks become decoupled. My working thesis for why they become decoupled is that the market goes into reactionary mode after an event like that, and only slowly do actors resume basing their value assessments on things like the weight of development effort and economic support for each chain.

You're splitting hairs. Nothing is stopping anybody from transferring bitcoin to an exchange if they want to trade, and then transferring funds out of the exchange when they're done.

Ehhh, I was with you until bug free programming. My understanding is that bitcoin released with a lot of bugs and it took years for the community to iron them out. There was that one bug that allowed somebody to create 180 million or so bitcoin out of thin air in 2013, that required a hard fork to fix (unless I'm mixing up my facts).
Still impressive. As Steinbeck said (paraphrasing), the greatest thing a man can do is the act of individual creation. Men can come afterwards and refine his work, but nothing can compare to that sublime moment of inspiration, and it's a necessarily individual act.
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:23:19
The process described, saving the web page locally and disconnecting from the network, is correct. I would however suggest using a more established wallet service, such as 
If you're going to write the address and private key out yourself, you're done. Send your bitcoin to that address and use any wallet software to sweep the private key when you'd like to retrieve the coins.
If you plan on printing out the wallet, remember to hard reset your printer afterwards, or the wallet will remain in the printer's memory. This can be accessed by a dedicated attacker.
Bonus: since a bitcoin address is derived from a bitcoin private key, and since a private key is just a 256-bit number, the _most_ secure (read: random) way to generate a private key is to flip a coin 256 times. This binary number can then be converted to the base 58 encoding used by bitcoin.

The discount comes from _nobody_ having to pay as much for witness (private signature) data. Of course making something cheaper will benefit the people who use this thing the most. But in a free market, there's nothing stopping anybody from building an application or starting a business that can better utilize the discount on this data.
I swear, I've never seen people complain so much about having something they use made cheaper. It makes bitcoin more competitive with other payment networks! Isn't that what we should be worried about?

I disagree that Jihan has been objectively bad for the development of bitcoin. The present situation has highlighted the need for spam-resistant mechanisms in a way that academic debate simply cannot. 
Black hat attackers are a vital component of any open source community. Driven by selfish motivations, they often prove to be more determined, resourceful, and creative than their white hat counterparts.
I contend that bitcoin needs these figures to stress test the system by acting maliciously. Better to find and eliminate these issues now than wait for an attacker with more resources to discover the vulnerability (read: state actors). 
The activation of segwit via the BTC1 client is irrelevant in my opinion. Nothing that's being done now can't be fixed once cooler heads prevail.

Well, the entire nature of the game is going to change as ASICs approach the 14nm boundary. I'm not nearly knowledgable about the manufacturing process to predict what will happen, but it seems to me that this should give other manufacturers a chance to catch up, especially with existing designs freely available for study.

But empty blocks make covert asicboost more efficient.
From gmaxwell's proposal to inhibit the use of covert asicboost (my emphasis added, 
"The other method is based on the fact that the merkle root
committing to the transactions is contained in the first 64-bytes
except for the last 4 bytes of it.  If the miner finds multiple
candidate root values which have the same final 32-bit then they
can use the attack.
To find multiple roots with the same trailing 32-bits the miner can
use efficient collision finding mechanism which will find a match
with as little as 2^16 candidate roots expected, 2^24 operations to
find a 4-way hit, though low memory approaches require more
An obvious way to generate different candidates is to grind the
coinbase extra-nonce _but for non-empty blocks each attempt will
require 13 or so additional sha2 runs which is very inefficient._"
He goes on to describe a method of eliminating this inefficiency, but a lazy owner of hardware with asicboost capibility could just choose to mine empty blocks.
Importantly, this proposal doesn't block the capability of covert mining empty blocks, only the (complicated) method he goes on to describe. Fortunately, segwit does block covert asicboost in all forms (to the best of my knowledge, please correct if wrong).

The list of all pending transactions (the ones that people have sent but haven't yet been confirmed) on the bitcoin network. This is the pool from which transactions are selected to be put in a block. The larger the mempool, the lower the likelihood of any particular transaction being included in the next block (assuming the sum of transaction size is greater than the blocksize). Thus, large mempool =&gt; longer average confirmation times =&gt; network backlog.
With Coinbase, we're seeing latency between users requesting that a transaction be sent to their wallets, and that transaction being broadcast to the network (approx. 8 hours for my last withdrawal). This has nothing to do with the mempool or the bitcoin network, and has everything to do with how quickly Coinbase can process these transactions internally.
I suspect they may be doing some funny stuff involving timelocking these transactions to keep the load on their system constant, rather than having spikes in activity which are prone to break things.

I think an important thing to consider when analysing arguments like "the block size limit should be removed because it's not serving it's original purpose" is how the argument is expressed over time.
Bear with me, but what may seem a reasonable argument at first can become more fleshed out over time, especially as tensions rise. I see this same argument being used as an appeal to dogma over at rbtc ("it was always intended that we remove the block size limit"). Not only is this a misinterpretation of Satoshi's words, but I contend that those words are wholly out if context for the current situation. Relying on the wisdom of ancients isn't a rational argument, and neither is relying on the intentions of a pseudonymous creator.

My understanding is that the role of bitcoin full nodes is to verify and rebroadcast transactions on the network. The economic importance of the node is defined by the number of incoming connections, i.e. the more people connected to the node, the more relevant that node is. 
I can't think of any reason sending and receiving personal transactions would interfere with this, as the role of a node is to send and receive transactions anyway.

@_date: 2016-07-31 05:15:38
I've has this thought before, although I came to it through necessity for a theoretical cryptocurrency of mine to work in practice. Essentially it involves a negative sales tax, where buyers get a marginal discount off the sale price, but sellers get the full asking price, and the difference is made up by freshly minted currency. 
This scheme couldn't work to incentivize trade and value creation the way its meant to, though, if the negative sales tax rate is less than the sales tax rate imposed by the state where purchases are made. The natural solution would be a "digital state," where the "laws" are minimal and determined by the same algorithm that dynamically determines the negative sales tax rate (to control the feedback that would be created by the conflux of inflation and a growing userbase).
And apparently the requirements to become a sovereign state are murky anyway, leaving a lot of legal leeway to make something like this happen 
I've sketched up a few more details on this hypothetical scheme if anybody is interested.

As a U.S. citizen who's personal politics lean more to the socialist left, I have to say that this current situation has made for some strange bedfellows.
First the Republican congress defending Coinbase users from the IRS, now this -- to use the alt-right's parlance -- big "nothing burger" from the SEC.
I wouldn't say that in this case the enemy of my enemy is my friend. That's one reason I think the trustless nature of bitcoin will be so valuable in the coming days. With the faltering of traditional alliances and outmoded concepts of trust, we're going to need a new architecture to allow decisions to be made, and I see that potential in bitcoin.
I imagine smart contracts that execute based on voting input from all those with authorized digital signatures. A way of making irrevocable, but still modifiable decisions at scale without the endless deliberation and fillibustering that plagues government today. Maybe that won't work and we need something entirely different, but neither the need nor the potential can be denied, IMO.
@_date: 2016-07-31 19:26:18
Sorry, fell asleep. This scheme on its own doesn't solve the double spending problem. I'm honestly not that great at the whole crypto side of digital currency, but there would have to be clear limits on the system from the outset. Can't have double spending, need to limit the number of daily transactions to prevent people from gaming the system with large numbers of microtransactions, and the problem of actually setting the negative tax rate dynamically and accounting for the growing number of variables in the system would be nontrivial.
But before it can even get that far, it becomes clear that such a system couldn't exist within third party states, because positive taxation would undermine what makes the system appealing in the first place. We want a currency that people are encouraged to use by being rewarded. We want this reward to be apparent in the short term (discounts for buyers, injected revenue for sellers) and we want the system to reach a steady-state with the least amount of stagnant cash in people's bank accounts (this is corporatism has been doing for the past few hundred years, value extraction doesn't seem to be helping things). By giving people a hard incentive to transact, we make money work for the people creating value, instead of working for the people who can loan out the money and passively collect interest. That's the idea, at least. I'm here to learn more about how something like this could come to fruition, and yeah, the double spending problem is a pretty big deal.
Gimme a minute, I'll copy some notes.

When I envision a steady state LN, its not a flurry of people opening and closing channels. Its a large, asymmetrical network of channels that for the most part stay open, because it's more expensive to close a channel (and pay a tx fee) than it is to just leave the channel open and collect fees when others use it to transact. There's no stipulation that the channel one uses to transact is a channel that one had opened themselves. The technical underpinnings of LN assume that this wont be the case, as an average transaction will travel through many nodes and the channels connecting them before reaching the intended recipient. For this reason I'm not sure the scenario you're proposing makes sense.
A LN that takes the shape I suggest would be _highly_ decentralized, FWIW

You suggest a UASF each time we upgrade the protocol. UASFs are not a guaranteed permanent split, as in a hard fork, but they do _risk_ a permanent split should the non-enforcing chain outpace the enforcing chain. Any initial hashrate imbalance would be amplified by the long difficulty retargeting period in bitcoin.
In the scenario we're describing (UASF split with minority hash power enforcing), the majority, non-enforcing chain would be the first to start publishing blocks. Comparitively, the UASF chain would be taking longer to find blocks (on average). Now, I'm not the market, but if the market is made up of people who think similarly to me, then people are going to want to use whatever chain is finding blocks faster. This effect, to my mind, would serve to amplify (in the short term) any initial hashrate imbalance. Because underlying technological value arguments are inherently based around long-term value -- esp. something like SW which takes a while for it's true benefits to become visible -- this short-term effect should overwhelm any potential value in the minority UASF chain, effectively snuffing it before it has a chance to prove out its superior technology.
That's just my opinion, tho.

This conforms to my understanding, thanks for taking the time to answer! 
I posted this because I see a lot of people referring to LN as overly expensive and inefficient, but that position seems to be ignoring the fact that a channel can stay open indefinitely. This means that once you've opened a channel to somebody else on the LN, in theory you should be able to transact with everyone else on the LN through relays, up to the amount that you've deposited in the channel. A common use case could be to simply deposit your annual spending budget (or whatever time frame)  into a LN channel and use that channel to make payments for the year (week, month, etc.)
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:37:01
Yeah man. What happens to bitcoin if miners lose their veto power completely?  You're talking about removing one of the pillars of the bitcoin power structure (Devs, Miners, Users, Exchanges). Can't remove one without the whole thing falling apart (arguable for exchanges, but I think that we certainly wouldn't be able to support the present-day market without robust, independent exchanges).
@_date: 2017-06-26 12:32:02
Maybe from a game-theoretical point of view you're right. But from an absolute standpoint, the probability of a chain split with an uncertain outcome occurring as the result of a UASF is decidedly nonzero. 
I just think that we shouldn't stop searching for a better way, and until then we need to continue exhausting options for miner compliance before taking any such risks.
@_date: 2017-06-12 00:05:56

Ok, so please keep in mind that this isn't intended as a reply to the original question. I'm proposing a thought experiment here, mainly to lay out my own ideas so others can point out where I'm screwing up. Warning: maths.
So we set out to find a cryptocurrency that takes advantage of the human tendency to gamify systems for personal gain. In other words we ask "How can we structure a currency such that actions which are beneficial to the individual are also beneficial to the market?"
The answer we (my friend and I) came up with was a *negative sales tax*. After some quick Google searches, we found that either nobody has tried this particular financial scheme before, or the idea never caught on.
Here's how it works: In every transaction, there is the seller's posted price S and the price paid by the buyer B. In traditional schemes the buyer would pay more than the seller's posted price by some mariginal amount (St) determined by the tax rate t, and a third party would skim this margin. B = S + (St) = S(1+t). Instead, we invert this. The buyer pays less than the seller's posted price by a marginal amount determined by the tax rate B = S - (St) = S(1-t). But the seller still receives S, meaning that St must be "injected" into the transaction every time a transaction is made. Clearly, if we're not careful about setting this tax rate, all this freshly injected money could do some very bad things to inflation and consumer confidence.
We should be able to estimate the amount of new currency injected into the system N. It will be tied to the tax rate t, the average value of new transactions v, and the total number of new transactions n.
N = n(vt)
but v will increase with inflation i.e. increased N
N = v x proportionality constant
meaning with fixed t and n, N will explode due to a feedback loop.
Assuming the number of new transactions is proportional to the number of users in the system U, we find
n = U x proportionality constant ==&gt; N = U(tv) x P
meaning that with fixed t, N will also explode when U becomes large (I've started using P to represent the generic constant of proportionality).
This is what we have to contend with when fine-tuning a negative tax-rate. And this is in the ideal conditions (there's probably a bunch of stuff I'm leaving out in this simplified picture). But, assuming we're right so far, it seems we could achieve steady-state by making the negative sales tax rate inversely proportional to both the number of transactions and the average value of transactions:
t = (1/nv) x P
The amount of new currency injected N could then, theoretically, be adjusted toward any value desired by adjusting P.
t = (P/nv) ==&gt; n = (P/tv)
N = n(t*v) by assumption
N = (P/tv)(tv) = P
Now, this is assuming a time-independence of the whole thing that's too unrealistic to give much credence to these calculations, but I'm confident that if the time-scale we're looking at for *new* transactions is fine-tuned, an algorithm could handle the nitty-gritty of setting this negative sales tax rate. 
I don't claim to have everything figured out, but it's certainly fun to think about.

Seems to me like Five Eyes governments (Britain esp. but the rest too) are trying to step up their digital surveillance game, and this is part of that. Passing laws to force travellers to turn over their social media passwords, checking phones at border crossings, its all ramping up to something. Theresa May may have tipped her hand with the government surveilled internet announcement, because that seems like exactly the future that these big brother politicians would like to steer us towards.
They're trying to build up a roster of laws and statutes to throw at "social malcontents." By the time they end up charging people with this kinda shit, it'll be one charge in a litany of bullshit digital crime charges. Any one of them is pretty easily refuted in court, but theres tons of em. Lawyers are fucking expensive and the government has lots of em.

This is the funniest part to me. It shows either callousness or a misunderstanding of how bitcoin works on the part of the email service provider. Now the attackers can continue to receive payments while the victims have no way to retreive their data. Fantastic!

I don't want to discredit UASFs as a concept, I think they have a valuable role to play in forcing necessary and wanted upgrades. I'm trying to advocate not being complacent with this method, even though we don't have a more reliable method readily available. We can use it, yes, but we shouldn't be happy about it.
I'm sorry that I can't think of a better solution, I don't claim to be great at abstract analysis of network topology. But there are other solutions out there (see list of BIPs related to segwit implementation, BIP100-110ish), and now that things are calming down just a bit around the scaling debate maybe we can take a harder look at these.

They probably think that improvement to the PoW is good (could argue this), but miss that patented PoW is bad. Misdirection, mate.

Remember though, the diff doesn't readjust for 2016 blocks. At 50% hash rate, this would be ~4 weeks. At 25% hash rate, ~8 weeks. This is the one of the big reasons hard forks on the bitcoin blockchain are so worrisome. Most altcoins have much shorter retargeting periods.

Other people can use the channel too, and you can charge a small fee for its use. This essentially turns that $100 "fee" into a dividend paying investment.
Why do toll roads exist? Because they're expensive to build, hence the toll, but convenient to use, hence the demand.

All the development there is to do for Segwit has already been done, it's just a matter of cajoling the miners at this point. In the meantime those development resources have to go somewhere.

Yeah, it could be the email provider acting at the behest of the governmemt. But that just outsources the callousness or misunderstanding to a place where it can do more harm lol

Hear, hear. I commend anybody who tries to cut through the FUD and misinformation (much of it innocent) around here. I tentatively support Segwit2x, although I think the name is abysmal, and I'll tell you why. 
The current implementation only uses version-bit 4 to signal for the _activation_ of Segwit2x, after which point the upgrade locks in and the miners begin producing blocks signaling version-bit 1, presumably to avoid any conflicts with BIP141 or 148 nodes. Now, I'm sure Jeff Garzik is a man of integrity, and fully plans to complete his implementation of the 2MB HF. But here's the thing... after Segwit is activated using version-bit 1, there's nothing _forcing_ anybody to activate any following 2MB HF. After SW is live, the only thing "guaranteeing" the activation of a blocksize increase is a piece of paper with a bunch of company's names on it. Just take a look at the 2016 Hong Kong agreement to see how much those are ultimately worth (
As it stands, I'm happy with the odds of Segwit being activated in the next few months :) And if not, and if the BIP141 signaling window passes, we get to take a crack at activating BIP149.
@_date: 2017-06-26 14:05:48
I disagree. I don't think a one-size-fits-all solution for BIP implementation is ever going to work well for bitcoin. At least not until we discover something that works better.

For lots of PoS coins validating nodes don't incur any fees as long as they don't spam transactions.

There are currently many competing implementations of the LN design. So while we know what the network will look like in broad strokes, the specifics will be nailed down by user adoption and the market.

To be fair, they didn't ask for the opinion of any UASFers when they reached "consensus." Not exactly the strongest consensus then.
