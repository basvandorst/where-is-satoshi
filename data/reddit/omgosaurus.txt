Watch for scam! I'm from Canada and even there, buying bitcoin is not so easy. If you ever find a seller, double, triple background check the seller!  What I'm trying to say is, even if you transfer from your bank for some btc offshore, don't think you will get your money back if you got scammed :(
I'm not very aware of the situation in Africa, but go for the best known sellers, online or not. Even if that mean a 10% buying fee. Trade very carefully!  Go with small amount first and built trust!

This picture is out of context. The article cleary dismiss your point by stating the struggle of money transfer BETWEEN different bank entities. That said, your interpretation is right, just out of the picture's owner explanation.

Doesnt work sadly,
Maybe this would help too, but there is no fee amount calculated. Usually I see below the 'Economic/normal' button an amount, now its blank. There is no number... like the fee api isnt working.

Still not sure what that mean... 
The 8mb wasnt accepted among pools  in the required time so some devs/group decided to fork it anyway? 
What is the difference with my current btc coin? Are they safe? Is XT just another 'alt' to invest in? Is the btcXT just a more tangible competitor to btc?
Yes, I'm probably all wrong :/

    Android or iOS?
 Android
    What priority have you set for the transfer?
Economic or Low-prio didnt work.
    Are you sure you have the correct wallet selected for the transfer you are trying to initiate? Are you trying to send the entire balance of that particular wallet?
I have only one wallet. I'm trying to move the entire amount. Never had any issue with this before.
    If so, what happens when you hit Max for the amount to send?
On the 'send' screen, Edit amount:  Spendable is 1BTC, When I click max, only 0.0002489 is available....
    
Thanks for all of these questions, I hope my answer can help :)

It's also a cash transfer without paperwork and bank account record.

Since i'm asking a veteran, what else is on your daily watch? (Bitcoin related of course)
@_date: 2015-08-03 22:48:06
Right on? Yes, and thanks.

The trezor is only a key that help you (easily) secure your wallet. 
You should be more concerned about how to protect your private key!
If you lost or damage your trezor,  your wallet could be retrieved in a new trezor if you still have your private key. But not the other way around.

There is no password needed. You only need your username and worker name (maverick639_worker1).
You don't have to worry :) the password is useless! Some pool accept blank or any password...
