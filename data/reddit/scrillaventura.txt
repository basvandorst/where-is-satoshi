Great video. Wrote a "look back" review of it for a new site  that's being slowly launched. We are helping the not so tech savvy invest in and use bitcoin..

I personally like XCP. It's a great way for artists, small biz owners, musicians and more to create assets to use as crowdfunding, rewards, paying dividends, and especially proof of purchase (from fine art to rare pepes.) As an indie artist who is not a coder, I think the ease of use to create an asset is important and often overlooked by more computer literate, technical folks. I've used cool GUI interfaces like rarepepewallet.com, Book Of Orbs, Indiesquare and counterwallet.io- all easy to use. The DEX is like a YouTube rabbit hole if u spend enough time on it. For comparisons go to bitshares' open ledger's DEX and tell me what's going on? Looks like a bad nightmare. XCP isn't perfect- but it seems to be well equipped for ppl like me. I like that XCP is anchored to my beloved Bitcoin and not a shitcoin too. Sorry for da bloat on da block

Easily one of the best crypto projects out. NO ICO scam BS . All organic coverage from real media that seeked out rare pepes, like Vice, RT News, Breitbart, dailydot and many more. Worldwide traders with accompanying working android and Apple apps like Book of Orbs, IndieSquare and the ever evolving Takara which incorporates geo caching (soon augmented reality) and air dropping tokens. The rarepepewallet.com is one of the most innovative crypto wallets ever and there's a rarepepeparty game that is in the works. Also, appealing to collectors beyond crypto so it's drawing people in that wouldn't have been in Bitcoin. Also it monetizes artwork on the blockchain, I've personally become a fucking meme lord because of this and the passive income is retarded. Nothing else like it in this space. Now some others tokens are popping up based off of this model. Pepe is a mirror™ and if you say it's some racist shit yer a fucking idiot who only scrapes headlines. Seriously, as tongue and cheek as pepe is this whole project shits on million dollar VCs that produce nothing.
