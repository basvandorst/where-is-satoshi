A milestone in Bitcoin history
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:29:25
These things are being investigated, save to say there were no red flags. Revenue was always a concern but with the IPO's sucess mainly due to the price increase, why should it have been an issue?
@_date: 2014-04-14 12:33:06
Looking at the questions its just not feasable i can give any meaningful answers to them. I will reiterate that Andreas was an advisor to our development team not Danny. He would have had no idea what was happening with the company other than its software etc. From what i know of Andreas he likely wants any large Bitcoin business to operate safely, i imagine if you had a company with the media exposure we had, and you wanted some advice on security he would be happy to help for the good of the technology. The idea that an early adopter like him would get involved with Neo for monetary gain is proposterous. I mean I spoke with Danny five times a day and i had no idea this was going to happen. I am limited to what i can and should/can say since i dont want any legal repercussions and i have to protect myself, i hope you understand this. I can say most of the facts are already out there. As for insider dumping this was not the reason for halting as far as i know. 
A few members of staff are currently writing a statement from their perspectives although again for legal reasons it needs to be vetted by a lawyer to avoid causing themselves issues
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:33:28
Plenty of software exists, how and where it could be used to to ownership is unclear save to say i hope PVS can recover from their involvement with Neo, they are a talented and amazing set of people
@_date: 2014-04-14 22:40:56
Read what i said again. 
-IPO to raise X
-Price increase means we get 4X 
-Business model aimed at getting getting established user base/penetration
How fast exactly do you expect an entire 'bank like' system to be designed and deployed? Ithink in most sectors 12 months would have been a perfectly appropriate answer. Dont try to take my comment out of context.
@_date: 2014-04-14 22:54:51
Point one, yes it was, we were aiming to open a bank like organization along with multiple other projects being worked on simultaneously inside 4 months, this is not an easy undertaking.
Point two, yes we lacked infrastructure to offer ONE of our products, ever heard of a phased roll out? What exactly is your point? It wasn't critical since we had so many other revenue streams in the pipeline and what we only fairly believed to be enough capital after Bitcoin appreciated so rapidly after the IPO.
In every context i ever heard his name mentioned he was a security expert. Granted i didn't need to spend a lot of time reading information the company put out for investors. Danny said a lot of things.
Direct your frustration somewhere constructive, i appreciate your angry but its not going to help anything. A couple of my colleagues are writing a statement regarding what the facts are, hopefully this will appease you a little.

Andreas wasn't an employee of Neo &amp; Bee
@_date: 2014-04-14 08:53:43
I apologize if you lost money in the venture, your nonsensical ranting suggests you did. Firstly, had the 'liquidity issues' not arisen, I have all faith the company would have been a resounding success, we had amazing people in the company and had huge projects in the pipeline other than Neo &amp; Bee.
Secondly, I cant speak for Andreas since I don't know that he was even being paid but I myself took a 75% pay cut to come and work for the company which rises to 78% factoring in the fact I didn't get paid my salary for march. Monetary gain couldn't be a further from my main motivation in working for the company. If it makes you feel any better I liquidated somewhere in the region of 70 bitcoins in order to relocate to Cyprus, which bearing in mind the immediate price rise as soon as I set foot on the island which based on the status of my current holdings cost me around $40-50,000. No-one could be more disappointed that things ended up as they did, but in our defense neither could anyone other than Danny have seen this coming. Our reputations withing Bitcoin and the reputations of the natives within Cyprus have taken more of a beating than any comment on Reddit can ever bestow. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 07:34:22
As an ex-employee of Neo &amp; Bee, i ask you please do not make this any more humiliating for us by dragging an innocent, upstanding member of the community into what was exclusively Neo's mess. Andreas was a Bitcoin security expert to whom our developers could pose any questions if they needed help. Obviously, with a name like his, Danny did the best to embellish his involvement to improve our own credibility. To turn the pitchforks on Andreas, who I can't even remember seeing at the offices, when the CFO, compliance officer and myself had absolutely no warning signs this would happen is wholly unfair. I say this even though I shared an office with Danny until early February  
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:27:53
I beleive you are mistaken in your interpretation of events. Neo &amp; Bee was not a scam and the business model was provably sound. One truth in the whole matter was that writing a new prospectus for shareholders was the last prioriy due to the workload. 
The pegged accounts and time locked accounts with a share of the returns were not to be launched till we had an adequate platform to hedge on. This platform didnt exist so we were in the process of designing our own exchange platform with futures and options to do this. If you were aware of who we were doing this with you would know that it had potential to become one of the leading exchanges in the world. With the radical payment processors we had lined up for EasyCoin, it also represented a significant revenue stream as well as a strategic asset. There are more examples i will not go into lest to say that Neo &amp; Bee quickly became the least profitable part of the business but remained key to the long term business strategy and identity. I am not, nor were any of my colleagues uneducated or blind to any flaws in the business model but i understand it was not fully communicated, this does not make it a scam.
Secondly i disagree with your point that a security expert should vet the whole business model. I can't imagine the schedule a man like Andreas works to. With our needs for him in a capacity as A SECURITY EXPERT i feel your attack stems from misplaced rage against what happened
@_date: 2014-01-22 23:23:05
Hoax... An amateur one at that...
@_date: 2014-04-15 08:46:40
Your confusing a business plan with a prospectus buddy. You don't semm to be able to understand so ill try one last time. Advertising Andreas as a our security expert was to reassure poeple that were weren't going to lose the coins to some sort of hack or malleability issue and nothing more.

For example the cheapest seller in the UK is currently selling at The equivalent of $927 this represents a markup of approximately $50 on bitstamp. In times of a rapid increase in price these markups regularly exceed $200+. Our mark up.isnt an arbitrary one, it represents the costs we incur. Selling bitcoins for cash on an international level involves many extra costs
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:12:20
As well as Zipzap already having partners in those countries it was judged these markets would benefit most. New countries will be coming online soon
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:40:48
Please compare the cost of other methods involving currency conversion fees, transaction fees and the time it takes the funds to reach an exchange.

That's why it says no "further" fees. We are being very transparent with our fees. If you are aware of a similar past service you will see our fees are identical. Using a cash payment to transmit money globally IS expensive. Easycoin makes almost nothing from these fees. It was decided to be transparent about the fees we would charge this at the point of top up rather than wait until you had already topped up to apply them
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:37:49
Please compare to the mark ups sellers on localbitcoins and the like regularly add. Especially in the UK it's common for the cheapest seller to be marking up over 10% and regularly upto 20% in times of extreme prise rise/decrease. A transfer from a commercial bank involving a currency conversion regularly loses many people anything upto 4-5% on the currency conversion alone, this doesn't even include the fee for making a wire transfer. An international wire can take over five days to clear. Sign up at 9 am and you can have your bitcoins by 9.30 paying in cash.

In the UK the likes of localbitcoins and bitbargain regularly sell at vastly increased prices, especially in times of high volatility ie. when the price rises they put on an extra margin incase it keeps going up and in a steep downwards trend the exchange prices take a LONG time to filter through. This is one of te reasons we at Neo wanted to start EasyCo.in. Our prices will track the movement of the exchanges very closely due to the way we replace sold coins

* All of the EasyCoin accounts were set up to deal exclusively with the EasyCoin venture. EasyCoin was **only announced** a month ago. If you check the [Neo &amp; Bee thread]( and the previous [EasyCoin reddit release thread]( you will see these accounts have been authorized and recognized by the CEO CryptoCyprus (Danny Brewster) and as such represent official company information outlets
* How woud you suggest we prove in a prospectus that we are real people? The CEO has been met in person by John from TAT investments, Alan Safahi CEO of ZipZap, interviewed bt Andreas Antonopoulos from Lets talk Bitcoin as well as more than one interview on Cypriot TV and face to face meetings with shareholders. I can assure you we all exist, however if you really want to be sure i suggest flying to Cyprus where i can arrange a tour of the 3 floors we currently work from along with meeting any one of our 25+ employees.
* The video is 100% animation, i dont think putting our faces in it would have been appropriate.
* The comments are disabled on the video becuase unfortunately we live in a world where strange people are free to come along and say devious things to deliberately try and mislead those who maybe getting their first introduction to bitcoin by watching the video. If you have any constructive criticism you are more than welcome to come and share it on the [Neo &amp; Bee thread on bitcoin talk](
* Im unaware of anwhere where we say we will only break even or lose money on this venture?! If you refer to my comment on this page if you read the OP i mention **during this beta period** as a thankyou to the voulenteers offering to help that we will run at 0 profit or possibly at a small loss, not permenantly!
* The reason for the "It works" page i would have to ask the Dev team. I assume its some complicated reason to do with the fact that theres a team of about 16 of them working day and night (including xmas day) to get this ready and they are possibly in the process of bringing something online/offline maybe. Previously it was just a logo for EasyCoin. Say/insinuate anything you like about our executive team but il not have you say a bad word about our developers [wagsfinger]( ;)
On a more serious note Neo &amp; Bee are trying as best they can to eat sleep and breathe transparency and approachability. If you dont know us then i ask that you please try to, and hopefully youl see why your concerns are maybe a little bit unfounded

We will use multiple exchanges depending on a couple of factors. Due to our business model times of extreme price swings we will be VERY competitive to the likes of localbitcoins.  This is forgetting the fact some people simply prefer to deal with a company as oppose to an unknown individual
