Would you say a person has a right to stop someone from harming another? Would YOU sit there and watch someone get raped and mutilated and say it's their choice? Regardless of age? 
It's not moral superiority, unless you think raping and mutilating someone is morally subjective. 
If you can rape and mutilate a child, then I can rape and mutilate you. 
Governments support and subsidize raping and mutilating children, at least currently in parts of the US.

More nodes = More bandwidth 
Yes, it seeds in P2P fashion. 
A lot of people entering in the space are only worried about price, not the underlying technology (my view.)
Currently the blockchain is around 150G - 200G (depending if you're running extra options). 
There's no downside that I'm aware of aside from resource consumption (drive space, bandwidth.)

Once the blockchain  is synced the Pi should be able to keep up with incoming blocks. 
The default mempool is 300M. 
I've only ran a headless Pi and it worked fine, I don't know know if it will interfere with your other operations as I don't know how much memory they will utilize.  
As long as the blockchain  directory has correct permissions for the user running the service, you should be good to go. 
250G space is a bit low as the blockchain  is upwards of 150G currently.  You'll eventually  need to upgrade.

Depends on what your bitcoin.conf settings look like, the specs of the computer/server, and bandwidth available.
I synced my node over a wireless cell phone tether at a max of about 1MB download speed, which would fluctuate from a couple hundred KB to 1MB. 
Took a few days of intermittent (not 24/7) syncing.
[ROG Strix GL502VM]( specs.
Mine has 16G of ram, i7, Ubuntu 17.10, bitcoind (headless).
I used one peer because P2P with many connections bogged down my speed. Once synced I opened it back up to more, which runs fine.  
txindex=1 (always)  
maxconnections=1 (until synced)  
blocksonly=1 (until synced)

8M.

Modem	28,8 kbit/s	00:38:50.   
Modem	56,6 kbit/s	00:19:58.   
ADSL	256 kbit/s	00:04:22.   
Keep in mind people need to be able to upload the chain as well. 
Initial sync as well as seeding it. 
I haven't run the numbers on it in many different contexts, but I do know increasing block size decreases the amount of users available to participate. 
I literally cannot even get dial up where I live. I run a node. 
Until recently my phone plan which I tether caps high speed at 6G of data usage, which after throttles to 15K. 
Hellish to torrent or do anything that is not sending a single request. 
Each connection takes up valuable data.
Keep in mind these are theoretical maximums. 
Sometimes many blocks are solved seconds after each other, which at 8M quickly turns into 24M with only 3 blocks.

When there are many [unconfirmed transactions]( *broken* wallets/services add higher and higher fees for priority inclusion into blocks.
This is a temporary issue that Bitcoin is experiencing. Solutions are being developed to alleviate this.
If you have your funds in your own wallet that allows you to manually set your fee then you won't deal with this. You will however wait till a miner decides your transaction is worth including per what fee you set.

However, that is an interesting idea. 
I want to flesh this out into a full distro with modular packages to snap in, like you're talking about. 
I'm not a seasoned developer, so it's gonna take some time to learn all the terminology to search for. 
First thing to do is a dialog menu (or something else that works and is simple) installer.

Be sure to run "git clone git://github.com/UASF/bitcoin -b 0.14-BIP148" 
stated in the first guide instead of 
"git clone  --branch 0.14"
in the latter guides.

Well, I mean, it relays information for the network, I just don't use it as a wallet and to transmit my own personal transactions, although it would be an increased security measure to do so. 
The mempool is capped 50megs due to the limitation of the hardware.

You can run a pruned node, and sync at another location and skip the initial download.

I transferred a synced directory and it caught up immediately. 
Another feature I hope to integrate. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 06:59:55
That's what I was thinking.
The seed should allow access to anything generated under it, correct?
Once I import the seed does it verify against the blockchain and pull information?
I've backed up, retrieved the mnemonic, imported it, but I see no verification of funds. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:05:43
I've attempted that for a few hours yesterday. I'm just unsure of some of the fields, such as the 0/'0 type ones. 
I'm assuming that defines the format of the protocol. 
It's only a small amount of funds, so I'm not really upset about losing them. 
If you've got history and are willing to help, I want to learn to prevent this from happening.

If you're updating anyway, you're updating.
I'm talking about verified, signed repositories and a trusted node that verifies initially, then seeding. 
The issue is updating many nodes at once with new code automatically, and decentrally distributing the verified update, with possible incentivizing of said process.
Has this case been addressed anywhere?
Of course the individual client can just connect to a repository and verify and download and update, but I want to distribute the load and decentralize the location.
Furthermore: This could be addressed per client automatically installing, or just retrieving and seeding for others while the operator reviews the changelog and decides.
