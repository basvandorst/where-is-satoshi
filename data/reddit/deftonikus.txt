labour did nothing, labour existed always, fishermen in primitive tribes were labouring for milenia and no Iphone came out of it, all the cool shit exists since capitalism, that is historical fact. Also thanks to technology that capitalism allows we will be able to clean and manipulate planet, even bring  back extinct animals and plants.
@_date: 2019-04-10 21:16:07
It was attempted... there are communities that share everything ...they live very simple life and have no cool shit, also they have to meet expectations of the rest of community so it is far from idea of perfectly free man.

In "true comunist country" ... do you mean in anarchy? What would keep order in such society if there wouldnt be authority with more power than others, what would stop super strong, smart or driven individual from gaining more resources, higher status, bigger social credit, or cult following, therefor more power if there is noone to opress him?
@_date: 2019-04-13 07:38:53
You are going really far to not give capitalism any credit, its kinda funny.
"Nazism didnt kill people. People did."
Sorry, but people were not doing just fine before invention of money, if not having money is just fine, why we fight against poverty???
Flow of time?? So why communistic tribes of Amazon and Africa did not invented Iphones? I mean being people+flow of time+labour, is what made cool shit right? So obviously they have what is needed to do so.

what is Saudi Arabia then?
@_date: 2019-04-10 21:29:31
No country was ever communist because country is not community.
@_date: 2019-01-06 13:26:06
I totally expected this. When I heard about hatespeech I immediatly thought... what would these people think if they hear death metal lyrics...now it looks like they did.
Im starting to miss religious freaks from 80s they were cuties compared to these neocommunists.

Actually many people over there have learned their lessons. People in their IT sectors are very progressive.
@_date: 2019-01-01 21:48:54
I hope that certain forces wont go after Bitcoin now...
@_date: 2019-01-05 14:07:28
there are always some bombastic reports from third world countries about crypto adoption, its like weird niche of crypto fake news
@_date: 2019-01-05 17:37:37
Huge if big
@_date: 2019-01-05 13:56:30
Those are some weird opinions and attitudes, I guess thinking is what separates rich people from poor in the end.
@_date: 2019-01-09 00:29:50
So they are more interested in technology? Im Ok with that trend. In the end it will be technology that will cure all ills that interested them in 2017.
@_date: 2019-01-05 14:23:09
So is there a DEX with a decent volume?

You dont have to innovate to win? I cant remember more ignorant statement. 
@_date: 2019-09-06 15:00:26
Yes, they just changed ethnic group for social class, its tribalism for poor people. Poor people are perfect and moral, rich people are selfish and evil, poor are poor because of rich... It is same logical pattern Hitler used when he was blaming rich ethnic group for misfortune of working class germans... It is all based on not taking responsibility for your own decisions.
@_date: 2019-09-27 13:43:19
Woah! this guy is savage!!
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:24:09
So why are poor people always migrating from socialist paradise to evil brutal capitalism? Why we never see poor people running from capitalist country to socialist one?
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:16:23
Then I expect you to share your bitcoin with a community, what else? Or are you traditional communist who enjoys private property rights while also wants to profit from virtue signaling about how he is better than rest of us?
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:31:42
Bitcoiners are working together for selfish reasons, they are aware they will be better off. Private company a dictatorship?? Will your boss decapitate you and put your family in Gulag for political poem? You dont like it, quit your job and do what you want... scary I know.
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:20:58
No,it is not, because you need authority with absolute power to forcfully keep all members of community equally poor, otherwise more driven/talented/capable/intelligent individuals would assert higher social status/wealth and communism would be over.
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:32:44
Yeah but communism mostly isn't .
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:39:44
Agree with the OP. In my experience, when I talk to people who hate Bitcoin with passion, it always turns out, they are socialist activist types, who hate BTC because they believe that socialist government of future should be able to redistribute wealth. They understand that it wont be possible if money is truly private and unconfiscatable. So yeah OP makes perfect sense.
