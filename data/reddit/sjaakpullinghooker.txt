Don’t worry, Ledger team is aware of this. Has been on their Trello roadmap for a while now

What I don't get is the part where you can sell your EOS tokens. I've claimed my tokens via EOS Ico. I have tokens in my ether wallet. But EOS states that you have to claim your public and private key before 1st of july next year (2018) this leaves me with the question what if people are selling tokens. They will eventually be useless because those tokens will not be stamped on the blockchain with a public/private key. Which renders them useless. Hope someone can shed some light on this ��

Yes, so you pay capital tax. Not income tax which is way higher. At least in my country
@_date: 2017-08-08 16:41:03
Nope, not income tax. You do have to inform the taxman though

Those are two seperate things you are talking about. The bitcoin desktop app and the application on your ledger itself. So they have different versions

Then you will also love shapeshift.io Beware though, on exchanges you can get slightly better rates. But Changelly and Shapeshift are much more userfriendly

Because of this behaviour his coins drop in value, that's why. And I partly agree with him on this ;-)

Used it multiple times now, works very fast. Are quick to respond on your questions on social media. Some complain about the rates of exchange but I found them to be normal

Did you ask if you could take their picture and post it online for everybody to see “and make fun of”? Not cool man, not cool at all

First of al, you dont have to buy whole bitcoins to take the same % of profit. If you put in 500 dollars and bitcoin increases 20% that 500 dollar also increases 20%.
Second, there are a lot, and I mean a lot of other coins you can invest in.

It is also very hard to explain to someone new to crypto, “look now you have 10 coins, after fork you have 10 coins of the other as well”
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:31:15
One thing is for sure, these forks are f*cking annoying for everyone holding crypto

I know, but still ;-)
