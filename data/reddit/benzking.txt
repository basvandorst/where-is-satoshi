Did you mean 152.00$
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:08:23
Cool idea! But if they invested early, say they invested $2,000 dollars in btc when it was under 50 cents a coin. And kept it until just this year, you'd have about 30 million. That's plenty of retirement money and a family fortune to pass on in your name and Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:42:06
Do they get paid in bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:16:29
Honestly maybe wait for a crash if you want too...
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:17:06
Depends what payment method you use each one is different, each person sets there own price for each payment method. If you look around at different payment methods you will see the prices range quite a bit

I use cex.io for my bitcoin cash (BCH) and my BTC. BCH took no time at all to withdraw from cex a larger amount as well. The only thing that maybe would slow you up is that you have to confirm an email for the withdrawal before they make the withdrawal but I got my email instantly after I requested the withdrawal. And honestly I like that security feature. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:17:33
EXACTLY this. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:39:31
Bitcoin cash will soon replace bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:36:20
Make an account on cex.io, send btc there, trade for BCH. If it doesn't work use a VPN.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:43:32
BCH would be wiser. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:53:54
Is it you selling? I am interested. I am on bitcoin real estate all the time I have been looking at a penthouse in acapulco Mexico that only gets paid in btc. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:45:10
Check each websites FAQ or blog they will tell you. Cex.io's blog  says they will give you the equal amount of 2x for all your 1x in your account at the time of the fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:18:22
Cex.io has no limits on trading as far as I know and you don't have to verify to trade. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:42:49
No but I very much want too. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:45:17
You can change payment methods and everyone has a different price there with different payment methods. If you quick sell for an amazon gift card you can get 10,000 a btc average if you want a 100$ gift card to amazon its heavily discounted. Done this multiple times and they will send you a picture of a physical gift card with the code and a receipt so you know it's not carded.

With BCH this option is entirely realistic. Transaction fees less than a nickel and decent send times. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:20:26
Thy are literally almost the same except with cash a transaction fee costs only a couple cents and takes less time from my experience with it. Also it has about 8x more space than BTC on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:19:41
Sell when it hits 8000 buy back when it hits 7050. Sell when it hits 8050, buy back when it hits 8000
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:21:05
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:22:12
Second this. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:26:50
Cex.io is good. Usd/BCH and BTC/BCH. Bitcoin cash is (BCH) not to get confused with BitConnect (BCC). A couple exchanges still haven't made the switch though and refer to bitcoin cash as BCC though so try to find BCH so you are ��.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:33:07
It's the people that aren't working? The ones that retired this year would probably be the best way to tell. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:00:53
Also I question the cost of lightning on top of the fees? Any idea on how much? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:35:15
BTC actually loses value over time like any good investment. I know exactly what I'm talking about. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:02:10
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:48:53
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:20:03
8040$ on cex.io exchange. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:18:41
I read somewhere though it's not free money. Each 1x (original BTC) will be worth .83 and each B2X worth .17. Correct me if I'm wrong here, I'll try to find a source to link. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:47:15
I wonder the same thing especially since some exchanges have hinted at calling the superior chain BTC, wouldn't that cause a lot of people to send to wrong addresses if the address doesn't support both B2X and 1X

Check out Localbitcoins.com there's like 20 different ways to buy brother 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:20:12
Check out BCH
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:00:47
It really doesn't matter tooooo much if you have both. I read somewhere 1x will be worth .83 and 2x worth .17. So nobody is really getting free money unless you hold and 1x AND 2x blow up. So maybe it would be better to wait till after the fork to see which chain is going to come out the dominant one between BCH, B2X, BTC. Correct me if I'm wrong here. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:18:00
Bitcoin cash is paying miners more as of a couple hours ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:07:05
9$ in fees for a 200$ transaction? Fuck me. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:29:36
Haha yeah that can happen! Just have a plan and stick to it don't let your feelings get in your way. Open the trades and leave it be for a day. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:36:56
Switching to BCH. No joke either. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:20:05
Not sure about FDIC insured but they are reliable and the fees are low compared to others. I moved my btc from Coinbase to cex but that's just personal preference 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:46:53
Look up DNM on deep dot web. BTC is the only form of payment. I believe this has to do with a large amount of market fluctuation as well. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:29:50
Didn't happen today, Coinbase prepared just in case it went through but it didn't. Nobody has 2x coins. It would just be BCH
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:46:49
Somebody sold all there coins and retired.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:42:14
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:23:46
I don't get why people would downvote you for this. It's a high risk decision and I'm sure you covered that in your PowerPoint. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:00:25
I think that's happening November 16th and that's a good question nobody really knows the answer to! Probably half value but that's just one persons opinion. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:37:38
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:03:02
BCH already came out August 1st and is already gaining traction and heading upwards. Your thinking of SegWit2X. If you keep your bitcoins on Coinbase they will send you the B2X coins 24-48 hours after the fork automatically, just check your accounts tab.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:33:22
Hahahaha dude.

Localbitcoins.com but check into BCH. Do your research friend.

Good point, there is a large majority of people that think their free 2X coins are going to mean thousands of free dollars though. That's what I thought until I researched more heavily into it haha. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:50:10
Why would you take a picture of you scamming somebody and post it on this? I don't understand.
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:12:37
And if your banks not cool with it get ready to call them after they shut the card off. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:25:14
I bet maybe they got refunded there .17 BTC for every share but I don't know
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:54:29
Localbitcoins.com doesn't ask your age, you can just send a Walmart 2 Walmart to buy. Or cash deposit to most major banks. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:39:07
A bitpay card is your bank account I have come to find out, don't use btc for btc/btc transactions, sounds crazy lol. But you move your money to your bitpay wallet, when you need money cash out cash twice as much as you need out onto your card. It's like a 1% transaction fee and allows me to keep all my money in btc. Register your bitpay card on coinbase, when btc touches $19,000 again you can cash out half your btc to the card then wait till it drops to 7,000 and buy twice as many with the same card on coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:02:01
If you got 20 btc for $200 total, it would be a good deal for a lambo ��
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:46:03
What makes it a "fraudulent" coin? Because it's a fork of Bitcoin made to  be an upgrade and has been extremely successful thus far??

Use an online card if you need it asap since your physical cards are on the way you can use an online card on most cards for the time being.
