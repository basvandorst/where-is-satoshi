Took me longer than advertised as well.  I sent support tickets and all. They ended up calling my place of employment and I sent another support ticket letting them know i got the message and I was finally verified.

What would be considered a reasonable fee?  Say I sold some stuff online and cashed out with Bitcoin.  Is a 1% fee standard/reasonable?
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:30:10
Lol. Living in the future is awesome. People back then were so dumb.  Should we tell them about Trump?

Or you could wait for it to drop lower, while it then goes back up to 700 or 800, then you panic buy thinking it's going to go even higher then it crashes back down to 300...

shitty government money is what he converted to in order to pay off his debts :D  Until the day when we could pay off our debts with 100% Bitcoin, it all comes down to how much government money our Bitcoin is worth

I only found out about Bitcoin because I was trying to buy a video card to replace my aging gaming rig and all the AMD/ATi's were sold out at the time.  When I looked into it, someone posted on a forum that it was because they were being used to mine Bitcoin, which at the time was just an inconvenience to me since I just wanted to upgrade my gaming PC.  Last year I was cashing out on OPSkins and saw they had an option to get your money in Bitcoin, it was at $700 at the time.  I used Paypal instead.  I came back to cash out again earlier this year and it was now at $1100, but by the time my cashout went through it had crashed and I got it around $900.  Been trying to keep up with it since.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:28:46
I sold all.  Only had 3.2, but it sucks that so many people act childish. Hopefully a solution becomes clear soon and Bitcoin can move on. I'll wait it out until then.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:11:16
Say there is a hard fork.  What happens with Bitcoin core? Does it automatically adopt segwit?  Sorry not quite technical when it comes to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:51:04
Sorry for that. Maybe when the hard fork is done and segwit is activated, maybe get back in then.  Until then I personally dont feel like investing.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:11:08
Well it's easy to hodl if you bought cheap enough, but if you bought at the current price or higher, why hodl? There doesn't seem to be a reason for the price to go up any time soon besides little spikes here and there.  There's more reason for it to drop though and makes more sense to sell and wait for something (hard fork) to happen. Buy after all this bickering is done with, if it's worth it.
@_date: 2017-03-06 14:38:04
so he says.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:38:59
The best time to buy was at a few dollars.  No one knows where we go from here, we all hope it's up, but doesnt hurt to be realistic.
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:20:32
I think the problem is also here, not the trolls who come here to cause problems, but some of the users.  It seems you cant speak your mind unless it's about the moon or hodling.  When I first got here after I acquired some Bitcoin i was like oh yeah I like it here, oh damn look more good news, and more and more... then it got old and now it seems like propaganda lol.  Dont get me wrong, I like to hear good things about my investment but it's ridiculous here sometimes.

wow this interview could have taken place a week ago and sound current.  Only difference being that they didnt mention anything about Bitcoin surpassing an ounce of gold.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:13:55
I dont know is not an option.
@_date: 2017-01-17 20:27:04
Unfortunately, I've been having the same issue, but with Gemini.  I'm at day number 6 and prices are back up and still haven't gotten verified.  I uploaded a scan of my California license, a current utility bill under my name and address and they told me they were having trouble identifying me?? So they asked me to upload my pay stub with employer info as well as my info, which I did twice (apparently they can't view .bmp files/ screenshot) because they needed it in PDF format.  Still not verified.  Ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-01-17 19:17:08
I finally got a response this weekend to my support ticket and was asked to provide additional proof of identity... Apparently my license and utility bill were not enough.  They asked and received a scan of my latest pay stub with all my information as well as my employer's... They even replied to tell me that the first screenshot (i get paid by direct deposit) wasn't in PDF (it was in .bmp) so they couldnt open it... So i printed it out and scanned it since my printer scans into PDF.. days later and still awaiting verification on their site.  Ridiculous, now that the price went up...arrrg.

Hello! - Please deliver to store owner.
In the last months, the people have been converting pesos with Bitcoin, this is due to the financial problems in Mexico and your government.
The people no longer trust their money to hold its value. They have begun to convert pesos to this digital coin, which permits you to make purchases with your cellular.
You can participate and take advantage of this opportunity to gain new clients. Countries like Venezuela have begun to take citizen's money from their bank accounts to pay debts and prohibiting
them access to their own money.
Many merchants in this area have begun to offer Bitcoin as a payment option. It's very simple to obtain.
It's like creating a Paypal account.
You can use any company or service you'd like. This is not an announcement.  This is about political financial change happening all over the world.
If you need help configuring any Bitcoin processor, you can let me know and I will try and help you. I have been following this technology during the last 6 years and I have seen it grow all over the world.
The following are options in order for your store to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.
If you'd like a sticker of "Bitcoin Accepted Here" simply send me an email and I will bring it to you later.
@_date: 2017-01-15 23:51:28
I want to buy Bitcoin and signed up at Gemini.  I confirmed my email address, phone number, linked my bank account, sent a pic of my license along with a utility bill both containing my name and address to verify identity 4 days ago.  How long does this process take?  I even sent a support ticket yesterday and no reply.  Is this normal?  As far as I know there's no discrepancy with my information, pretty simple really.

Jack Nickolson would have made that intro perfect with "You cant handle the truth!".
@_date: 2017-04-03 19:14:16
Well considering its history I wouldn't be so optimistic.  Yes, I believe the price will only go up in the long run if Segwit is activated, but before that happens anything can happen.  That's why we see that little roller coaster guy so much.
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:00:12
lol you act like the price is going to stay steady and never go back down again.  They'll have plenty of chances to buy back in at a lower price.  
@_date: 2017-05-11 19:14:27
I believe since the SEC is "reconsidering" the ETF denial, some people are riding the hype and going to sell before the 15th.  Then, when it's re-rejected, some more will sell, but in the end the price will come back up like it did right after the last rejection.
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:26:20
These fake ass posts.  I have Bitcoin as well, but stop with these BS posts...   
This is like the 3rd or 4th time I've seen one of these posts, I'm sure there's many more I havent even clicked on.

speaking of which, my brother in law's girlfriend has been trying to get us to go in with her for gladiacoin or onecoin.  I told her nope, I already have bitcoin and ethereum.  she said she has bitcoin too, doesnt know how much because they watch it and trade it for her.... i didnt want to burst her bubble because i would sound like i was attacking her.  I just told her she should do more research.
