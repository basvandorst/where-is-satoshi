I only recently subbed and I'm still trying to understand what exactly bitcoin are and how they work, so can someone explain to me what this is, here? Bit bowl? Tipping?

I'm no economist, but I find it interesting that, despite the fact that various states have begun to embrace bitcoin (California) and a good number of companies have begun to accept include Microsoft, this will likely be bitcoin most volatile year.

The lack of understanding of both economics and geopolitics in this thread is absolutely mind blowing.

I think the former is easy, the latter impossible. You can't educate folks who have resolved to not change their mind. Besides, facts don't matter, how you're left feeling is what does. Especially in the US they matter very little, it's why Fox news has the highest ratings and americans get treated like idiots in election season. Because few actually listen for the facts. We just want our heartstrings to be tugged on.

That's nonsense, they can't cave without caving to everyone else and that is never going to happen,not with Syriza promising to go back on all reforms previously implemented because it just sets up Greece to bomb again. [this]( economist article pretty much nails it.
