It's because they are reckless. I lost 25k in btc and eth on btc-e. It's not worth it.

It's so weird how everyone touts core as "the most competent" group. That's some weird propaganda level shit.

Schiff does make one good point [here.]( Which is that there are now a lot of people entering the space, i.e. goldman sachs, that don't actually care about what the community is trying to accomplish. They are entering the space purely because they see $$$ and think they can suck some profit out of it

The fact that you have a group called "Core" working on bitcoin is in itself stupid, the fact that one team of developers is capable of holding up a hf is ridiculous and dangerous.

I just read that again, it looks like the majority of the financial position of the US is all of the houshold wealth which is of course completely misleading to count since there would be violence and revolution before those "stores" of wealth could be tapped in any significant way to pay government debts. The government is still broke. Those assets would also lose a lot of value if the government suddenly started taxing us at 60%

If we were taking on good debt, debt to gdp would be going down but it has gone up the past 15 years or so

You can't sell the highway system though. If America loses credit we will be in for another liquidity crisis

we havent had any meaningful amount of inflation in a few years now though

that's just not true at all. Inflation makes borrowing more expensive and reduces inflation. The interest rate has more to do with incentivizing borrowers.
