That is true according to the lead monero dev, who is also famous for always repeating "don't buy monero" ;) 
Monero scales far better than Bitcoin because it has regular 6 month hard forks for protocol upgrades. It also has dynamic block size. The only bad side is that the transactions are bigger (information wise) so as overall the blockchain can bloat more easily than Bitcoin. But there are solutions to this currently being tested with other altcoins. And monero can easily adopt any new working tech. Bitcoiners on the other hand think "hard fork" is a dirty phrase, which is extremely ignorant since in the cryptocurrency world "hard fork" = progress. That 50 % btc dominance index, that used to be 90+ % will be below 10% in a few years. "Bitcoin" is an idea, not a specific blockchain or name. :)

Real question is - Why would anyone ever need Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin when you have Monero.
