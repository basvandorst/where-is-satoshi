Oh the limited ground support for BCH has obvious motives. These aren't people who invested in bitcoin in the early days. They first got into crypto around the time BCH was formed and jumped on board because they wanted to get rich. They spend their time trying to convince the rest of us to jump on board to pump the price. Not happening. Every BCH pump has been a co-ordinated effort. No organic support there like bitcoin enjoys.

By then it should be more ready. Welcome to decentralization. There is no official decree. It's a protocol that will over time be adopted and implemented by the network. Personally, I think that's fantastic, because it means the network will be hardened over time. It's worth noting that all of this is happening on the *bitcoin* network, right now.

It's not the nominal rate they quote.. it's the taxes and fees and charges that go beyond that. I'll bet the kwh cost is at least 50% of your bill of not far more. Delivery charges, etc.. that's your real cost. It's a billing game.

This is false. And even if it were true. My bitcoins remain under my control. Nobody can stop me from using them. Fees are dirt cheap. Transactions are immediate. As a user, I have nothing to lose.
This maintains the original purpose of borderless, permissionless, non government asset class and payments. It sticks it to financial institutions and provides banking to the unbanked. 
Some people have been brainwashed by a greedy few trying to detail this.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:37:40
You're describing a future that in all likelihood is beyond our lifetimes, but certainly likely. Fiat currencies will co-exist with cryptocurrencies for some time, for good reason. They are relatively stable transaction mediums of exchange in most of the world, for now. That's important for business, today.

@_date: 2017-12-13 14:39:43
Not much
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:34:01
We keep a decentralized layer 1 with a fast, cheap, effective layer 2 solution that will likely add some centralization. This layer 2 solution will not allow anybody to co-opt the network and while it will share some similarities with banking it is not the same thing and it's certainly not going to replace the banks current income. Layer 1 replaces the corrupt monetary supply. Layer 2 replaces payment providers and banks.
Users will have fast, cheap, and trustless money. Legacy payment providers bite the dust completely because nobody wants to pay 2% for a 2 week settlement and get a chargeback
Further, nobody is forced to use layer 2 lightning. But you know what, people will and this will largely resolve scaling which is the only remaining roadblock.
If you argue lightning is traditional banking you are a dope, and no amount of spoon-feeding is going to change your mind.
Love this guy's videos and he compares existing layer 2 to exchanges that people use all the time but don't need to use all the time. LN is better than that.
Go read Andreas 2ed Mastering Bitcoin he talks extensively about the advantages.

I'm not going to address your false statistics. I'll challenge you on this:
According to you, the lightning network will destroy bitcoin, and it will be controlled by the banks. If that's the case, why bother trolling r/bitcoin because bcash will be there to the rescue when everything is controlled by banks. This is completely absurd, and it will be obvious next year when LN is live. It will be obvious 10 years from now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:15:22
Nonsense. We will get the lightning network. It will be amazing technology. And Roger will ask us to thank him for it. Roger is a pain in the ass, yes, but on some levels he's right. He's creating a lot of noise but he is lighting a bit of fire. He will not be directly responsible for saving Bitcoin in the way he may think now.

As long as the risks are disclosed to investors they are free to choose how to invest their money. Suggesting that an ETF shouldn't be approved based on anything in the article is absurd.
Should you be prevented from buying or selling bitcoin on the grounds of a possible hard or soft fork? An investor can choose to buy an ETF or BTC directly.
People should be allowed, encouraged even to vote with their own money.

Bitcoin doesn't need anybody's approval. This is what it is, what it was designed to do. Permissionless transactions. It has done this for more than 7 years, and will continue to do this for many more to come.  
The smart money has already started to figure this out. Rather than buying an ETF, that money will naturally flow to the exchanges.

You talk about "the wealth" as if this is a pie that's been somehow unfairly split. You think you've been robbed.
The pie is growing. Nobody robbed you.
And guess what? It will continue to grow because bitcoin has value, regardless of what anybody thinks about that.
I'll tell you that freedom and equality of outcome are not mutually compatible, as much as many hopeful young egalitarians might think. You don't get to have both. Anybody can buy bitcoins. But they don't have to. The result is that there will be an unequal distribution bitcoins, simple as that. It's guaranteed.
Those who whine about an outcome because they didn't use their freedom deserve neither.
I choose freedom of choice and accept the outcome. An outcome that might include failure.
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:00:49
I mean approval to "legitimize it".. basically exactly what Andreas said.
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:18:50
Basically this. There are 2 more ETFs in the pipe. Gold ETFs took years to be approved. A rejection is par for the course but an approval is like two holes in one. Lose small, win big. Honey badger don't care. One day millions of folks will scramble to own 1 BTC.

Thank you redditor for 3 weeks. Can you provide a source? I disagree, we are definitely closer to a solution since the activation of segwit, and because development has been ongoing. And with BCH on it's own we're significantly closer to having a solution on BTC since those folks won't need to distract developers anymore. I think it would be quite unrealistic to think that LN isn't coming. It is coming. It's just a question of time.

The value of gold is always increasing as more is being mined. It's more accurate to use 16.6M, the current number of bitcoins, against the current market cap of gold.
Adjust your estimate up by 26%. By the time all 21M bitcoins have been mined, there will certainly be more gold..

I've been in bitcoin for years, this is a recent problem. It has been debated for years, but fortunately LN development has been ongoing. Bigger blocks are not a solution. Scaling is one of the few problems that haven't been concluded. I'm not worried. Just excited to use it. I expect it next year. I'm just curious.. when more precisely. I haven't been close enough to recent development.

No, he has some rich friends. However, I don't expect this to last longer than a few weeks. 
**It's a free market.** He is welcome to sell his bitcoin, and buy any coins he chooses. Bitcoin X, Bitcoin Z. **That's totally okay with me.** Make no mistake, this is whale money, and bitcoin is susceptible to it. But bitcoin can't be printed, so eventually he and his friends will run out. **I'm okay with that**. That's why he needs other people to invest. **It's all good**, because it means it's still early days for a currency that has been in circulation since 2009.
At this rate, he and his friends could very well own a sizable portion of all bitcoin cash in circulation. I mean, nobody has been using it, and most of us have been selling it. And of course, right now for the price to run up so high it would seem there are very few sellers left at all. **That's perfectly fine with me.**
I will choose to hold my bitcoins, and not to buy bitcoin cash. That's the decision I made and will continue to make as I look forward to an exciting world ahead.

I think this is silly. The 1/1,000,000 club, even accounting for satoshi's coins, and lost coins, is, TODAY, 16.66 BTC. Why plan for total supply more than 100 years out? And by then, you can be sure a heck of a lot more coins will be lost. I'd wager that the 1/1,000,000 club today is more likely somewhere between 12-14 BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:15:56
Core doesn't need to figure out the LN solutions.. that's the point. The blockchain is immutable layer 1. Secure, reliable, decentralized. To scale, layer 2 makes sense.. it takes time. Have you watched any of Andreas' videos on this? There are multiple teams working on implementing solutions for the LN protocol. There is a testnet.
Bitcoin isn't a company. That's why this is all awesome. Scaling blocks is a short term solution based mostly on shaky quasi-religious grounds. This is about developing good, smart money. Fortunately BCH won't need to scale to 1 GB+ blocks as nobody will be using it. The $20 transaction fee problem was an attack, and it's already abating. 90% of the community understands this.

Retail investors haven't started to buy it. 
Hedge funds are just getting started.
Futures and derivatives haven't even rolled out yet.
This is a better asset that gold. Period. It's currently valued at only a fraction of gold.
I'm quite confident that we are not in a bubble. Bitcoin has simply been tremendously undervalued. 
That's my investment philosophy. If you disagree, I hope you've sold all your bitcoins and are holding out for $1450 bitcoin. You might be waiting for some time. I think bitcoin is a bargain under $10k. I believe that we will hit $100k within a few years. This is just the beginning of the digital age. Bitcoin is, and will continue to be *THE* digital asset that defines the digital age. It's been clear to me since 2013, and nothing since then has changed.
Wall street is just waking up. Milton Friedman, a renowned economist of note, not simply one with a degree, saw this coming two decades earlier. Bitcoin is not traditional economics. It's an entirely new type of asset. Price discovery is just getting started. The network effect has already taken hold.
It will have the properties and utility of a currency, but it will not be used strictly as a currency. This is why it's worth so much more than the conservative estimates that assume currency only use are so far off.
But don't let me dissuade you. At no time in the history of the internet has anybody every said "you know what, I was wrong, I agree with you". I'm quite convinced you've already made up your mind, as have I. If I was a venezuelan, I know what I'd be using.

We should remember that Andreas has not taken sides in this debate, and we should not force him to.

This is not about wrestling others that their money is wrong, but growing and improving the space as a whole, for all of us.

@_date: 2017-11-13 01:37:10
You must be kidding. That's not normal transactions it's a co-ordinated dump of BTC by a small few wealthy individuals to try to overthrow it with BCH. 
Think of the alternative explanation. Bitcoin was at an all time high with greater support and media coverage than ever before. The developers behind segwit2x cancelled it and Bitcoin rallied. Out of the blue this happens. It's Roger, Jihan and crew. This is not normal use. Support has not changed.
It's a last ditch effort. A few days ago the BCH subreddit did nothing but post Craig Wright tweets. If you truly believe a sudden reversal in sentiment happened you are crazy. History will show this, I am sure.

How big is the BCH network? I'd wager almost nobody has been using it aside from selling it. For all we know more than half the BCH in circulation is now in the hands of one small, determined group that has been buying it up over the last few days just when bitcoin was experiencing it's strongest growth, coverage, and acceptance really ever. Does that make it more or less valuable? I guess we'll see..

Two words: Insider Information
To launch by the end of the year, this must have been in the works for months. People with deep pockets found out. Information is money to these guys. The timing just seems too coincidental. But bitcoin is an unregulated asset (in most of the world), or at least in a grey zone so who's to call foul?
In either case.. it's just accelerating the inevitable. Bitcoin is gonna be YUUUGE.

Follow the money.. most of this has been happening on the Korean exchange with a few others limping along out of fear. It's a pump, timed deliberately with some news articles to inject fear into the markets as though we're all screwed without Segwit2x but luckily BCH has been here all along for the rescue. HODL tight. Never forget.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:08:44
Bitcoin is going to rocket back when bitcoin cash supporters realize that their scaling solution only works temporarily. It will be a mad scramble, including new money that has been injected into the cryptocurrency market.

What's bigger than Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Visa, and Berkshire Hathaway combined? Gold. What's bigger than gold? Offshore banking. $30T. 
Money is the most valuable application.
Bitcoin is seeking to disrupt more than that. At $100B, this is the only play. If you own a hedge fund, and you aren't accumulating a position, just in case, right now, you're an idiot.

Yes they do.

His point stands on nothing. The SEC listing request clearly states that this ETF will be backed by bitcoins purchased on exchanges and it even goes so far as to say which ones. Since it obvious none of you clowns read it I'll add that the minimum buy is 25 BTC so this ETF will not be for retail investors.
@_date: 2018-07-18 11:41:25
This ETF isn't for retail investors. The smallest unit is 25 BTC.

Charts dont predict price action. Posting shit like this causes it momentarily. Everyone selling including yourself will buy back. Should HODL instead.

Stolen because a bug in the ethereum protocol was exploited. Not simply a hack of some exchange. That is significant.

Bullshit sorry but lines on a graph don't predict anything they influence weak minds instead.

Ethereum or Ethereum Classic? What happened to the DAO again? 
Something something JP Morgan private chain.
Buy bitcoins.

Collectors on bitcointalk do, and they sell at incredible premiums on eBay. Great investment hedge if you ask me.

Yes, we can trust Ethereum to write code that gets hacked and then does a hardfork to restore the funds. This is what happened. Your post history indicates that you are new to this. It was before your time. It's going to happen again. Ethereum Classic is in fact the original chain. I wouldn't trust any significant amount of money on that thing. You want smart contracts and potentially buggy code, all the best to you.

An attic is a super dangerous place to store these. It gets really hot up there. Also these aren't that old :p

I think a lot of them have already started buying.

Is that true? Satoshi must have held an advanced degree at least. Nobody else would bother.

False. Most ETFs do not use futures. They do buy and sell the underlying assets to form and remove creation units. The fact that you stated this and it got upvoted is a huge swing of misinformation.
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:19:40
Have you seen how few transactions Ethereum does now, and how shitty their scaling is going to be? Bitcoin is going to be faster and more reliable as a currency. Have fun spending gas on your smart contracts because unless you need them you're making a mistake. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:35:43
Why would any government give up control of their currency?
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:01:58
Every government controls the supply of their currency.

He guaranteed each could would be worth $20 at launch. His company would ensure it. That lasted for all of maybe 50 seconds. This was a tremendous scam, and many people lost significant amounts of money. He's an asshole.

Cool but the name Opus has already been used for an audio codec.. this is confusing.

BTC is better money. ETH was better for ICOs..

The herd selling now is doing it to buy back later. The herd buying then will be bigger.

$300 to pay someone for finding a critical hole in your network sounds like a bargain to me.. moral and legal issues aside :p.

Lol after how many years? Reddcoin is a failed experiment. Why tip a useless token?
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:50:24
You think bitcoin has scaling problems? Lol. Ethereum will never be able to scale as a cryptocurrency. This is a speculative bubble by folks that think Ethereum behaves the same or better at scale. It never will. It's designed for contracts. And nobody is using it for that purpose. The commercial interests will be using their own private ethereum-like chains.
@_date: 2017-06-11 00:41:00
This idea has been rolling around for years. Ultimately, it's up to the exchanges. You can't enforce anything.. and there is no need to.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:49:34
It's okay guys we can just fork Ethereum
