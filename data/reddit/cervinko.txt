by adding more hops to the block propagation?? 
you receive data that you don't need and pass it on to an other node that (most likely in those days) does not need it either.
imo block propagation would be faster if we have only mining full nodes. (but i also see that there are some specific usecases for running a full node without mining)

ok i hope now i get it: i ment you use more of your upload bandwidth than your download bandwidth after initial sync.
What do you think of my view that new syncing nodes that go offline before they start to be supportive are the reason for that?
i think S2X failed because miner support went down before the fork date and then the S2X canceled it. You can not use counting "full nodes" to determine majorities for the reasons you mentioned. i think the spike in btc1 node before the non-fork was just for some propaganda.

you are right. by running an "economic node" you can choose the chain that fits your needs best in the event of a chainsplit. but OP thinks that he is running a full node and that he supports the network by doing that and both things are just not the case.
if he is running his "economic node" to be best prepared for a chain fork then everything is fine
(Btw, this answer is for you)

i do not really get this full node thing... with 10min blocktime and hours of txn confirmation time to me it does not really matter if the next full node to broadcast my txn is 1000miles or 10000miles away. 
this is not high-freq trading on wall-street....
but i appreciate that you want to support the network
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:15:43


how do you do that?
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:49:58
but he also puts load on the network by downloading from other users. you are assuming that he has more upload than download. after sync he was just downloading 150GB (?) from the network. so it will take a while until he starts "supporting" the network if he ever reaches that point. 
According to my experience many non-mining full nodes stop before the start to be supportive to the network. they just have too little incentive to keep their node up. i think that could be the reason why we see a lot more upload than download on most nodes. (would be interesting if there are any stats on how much bandwith is used to upload old blocks)

I think you understood something wrong in Satoshis Bitcoin whitepaper:
you only run a full node if you are actually mining bitcoin blocks. you can look this up at   at section 5.
You are just running a relay point in the network.
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:41:32
how do you support the network by running a full node that does not mine? or do you have any specific usage for your node? (network analysis or something...)
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:49:05
but if your node is not mining you are not including any blocks. you just relay them and hope you hit any node that actually mines.
of course a block that does not get sent by his miner will get orphaend. but if the  block would just be sent to non mining nodes it also will get orphaned.
But back to my question:


i would really like to know the answer to this. i'm not really into networks and so far i found nobody who could explain this to me. so atm i more and more think that non mining nodes are just needless
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:06:01
sorry i was not very clear on that. i ment that you need more upload bandwidth than download bandwith after initial sync.
of course it is true that running a "full node" is used to show support for different chain forks. but i doubt it that is a good behaviour (f.e. for the reasons you mentioned)
i also have to say that it does not matter if you are supporting the network or not if you just run the "full node" to be best prepared for a chain split and to be able to make txn right in the event of a chain split. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:32:33
yes. block propagation is fast enough. also i do not really see a problem in running a full node. if you like to run one, have fun... but it does give any benefits to the network.
If a miner who mined a block can direclty send it to other miners, why should he send it to non mining full nodes before?? how does this add any security?

you can still buy smaller amounts, but you should leave it on exchanges.
or you buy together with some friends and do the accounting in private tabs....
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:23:11
in the last year txn fees went from about 50sat/byte to about 500sat/byte. a standard (1 input, 2output) non-segwit txn has about 220byte. so if the fees keep rising at the same speed a non-segwit txn will cost you 0.01btc. i dont know the block-weight of a normal segwit txn. but you definitly should consider that 0.005btc could be unspendable in 1 year even with segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:41:23


i don't think so. i just tried to explain the 'roadmap' of the core-devs. if he waits until LN for such 'dust' transactions, he will see that LN does not work for scaling and hopefully will leave for better solutions
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:11:18
I think you are mistaking bcash for bitcoin cash. Bitcoin cash is not that bad. Afaik you can actually use it for transactions...
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:46:01
if you are aware could you explain why are you taking that risk? i don't see the advantage in dividing your holdings to dust inputs ....
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:18:34
well.... the bitcoin core scaling theories go like: if everyone uses LN (and Segwit) the fees will go down because the blockchain does not get filled up with microtransaction. if you don't believe in this theory i would recommend alt-coins that have different scaling approaches. f.e. ethereum or bitcoin cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:10:52
but you could have trouble spending those 0.005 in some month/years.... i think you should not save less then about 0.1 btc in one adress/input. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:35:11
i would recommend to help your friend to setup a bitcoin wallet (and backup) on their phone. then send them your gift to their own address.
so they can actually use their bitcoin and get experience with cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:27:15
you should wait for LN to save such small amounts on one address. those vouchers are already now hard to spend and will probably be unspendable in the next weeks/months/years
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:18:12
and you only paid 0.00045652 BTC fees. Thats only 3.2%! 
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:00:55
segwit allows 100000x scaling. no one here said that it actually does scaling...

Where do you see empty Blocks??? They are all full! (Exept of some antpool Blocks)
I think you switched you blockexplorer to bitcoin cash
@_date: 2015-08-02 10:23:02
I think there is one mistake in your argumentation:
The coins that the bot bought did not really exist. They where just in the mtgox database. So the bot bought coins that did not exist with money that did not exist.

ok. they can create their own super-bitcoin-friendly-policies so that they can say: "we are sorry! we would process your transaction but the bad landesbanken refuse to do it" (actually that was exactly what my banker told me)
And although perhaps legally it would be possible for a Raiffeisenbank to choose to do the SEPA transaction via some other intermediary, i really can't immagine that they will do so because of some transcations related to bitcoin. 
i also think it's complete nonsense to say that the Raiffeisenbanken are independant, because they use the same online-banking system. of course perhaps legally it would be possible for every independant raiffeisenbank to make their own online-banking system, but...
@_date: 2015-07-14 18:56:36
the 500 raiffeisenbanken in austria are not "independent" at all. They are all doing their SEPA-Transactions via the Raiffeisen-Landesbanken or Raiffeisen International.
So if the Landesbanken or Raiffeisen International refuses to process a transaction all of the 500 Raiffeisenbanken in Austria are not able to process this transaction. At least this was the explanation a banker of an austrian Raiffeisenbank gave me when he told me that i am not allowed to send my money to bitstamp.
