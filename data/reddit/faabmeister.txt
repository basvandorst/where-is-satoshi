I can't even read the article because every 10 seconds it opens a new tab saying my phone has been compromised, and I need to download some shitty malicious anti virus. Great site...

This is sarcasm right (hard to tell). About all the crypto's are going down. Nothing to do with an attack on bitcoin.

This is good. It drives out the people that only want to become rich with bitcoin, and frees up space for people that are genuinely interested in the wonderful world of bitcoin :)

Might not be exactly 8 times, but fees will increase as the amount of transaction increases. 
Not sure how you think I'm assuming total fees will be the exact same, because you literally just replied to a post where I stated that the fee's will be different...

Bitcoin has a value, if the price of bitcoin goes up, the total value of  bitcoin you're holding goes up. Only once you actually exchange these bitcoins back to the fiat you're talking about, it's profit.
It's like saying you're a millionair because you own a house that is worth 1 million dollars. You don't actually have a million dollars, buy you do possess something with that value.
Same goes for the 80k "worth" of bitcoin. The money isn't real unless you exchange those bitcoins for money.

Upload bandwith shouldn't be that much of an issue for any block smaller than like 100MB right? But I could see it being it problem with people that have really bad internet.

I think you just posted enough details for people to access your wallet and take out all the funds. I would take down this post if I were you and transfer the money to a different adress (ASAP).
I might be wrong but I believe I saw a warning post like this before.

The thing is, those 8mb blocks will fill up and blocksize will increase even more. Eventually blocks will be so big that they won't be feasible anymore. Bitcoin cash has no long term solution and will fail because of that.
Do some research before posting garbage cringy clapping emoji's :p

Ye, and the average fee will be 8x lower. Right now, bitcoin's average fee is 30 dollars. So if bitcoin cash becomes as big as bitcoin is right now, your average transaction fee will be about 4 dollars. So there goes your "low" transaction fee. If you want to advertise low fee's you'll need another blocksize increase well before you reach bitcoins current size.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:16:18
I also believe a 2MB block would be a great idea right now. A 2MB block shouldn't be that much of an issue centrilisation wise.
I say yes!

If bitcoin goes down to $0 the only thing you lost is value (potential money expressed in USD). You still own your bitcoin, they just lost their value. What you don't seem to understand is that you either own your bitcoin, or you own the equivalent amount of money (USD). You can't own both your bitcoin and the money that those bitcoins are worth at the same time. You exchange one for the other.
Therefore, you can't lose the money (USD) that those bitcoins were worth before they crashed to $0, because you never even owned that money. You just owned the equivalent of that money in bitcoin.

They actually removed the link many months ago because of complaints, but soon after it was up again for some reason. Not weird at all /s

Do you even understand what taxes are for? They're used to maintain infrastructure, pay for public services, fund schools and to provide healthcare for who ever needs it. They are literally keeping my country alive. If you want to be some cringy "I am better than the regime and don't need to pay taxes because I'm special" kind of guy, then go for it. But if your whole country had the same retarded mindset as you do, you'd probally not want to live there anymore.

Well... I'm from the Netherlands, not the USA. My country's military is an obsolute joke and we provide only a fraction of what we should to the EU forces. I personally don't believe that my country is that "corrupt" and I don't feel like my politicians are useless. I also believe that voluntary taxes are retarded, because most people would rather keep their money for themselves, than provide healthcare to someone they don't know. This is especially true in capitalist countries like the USA.
Maybe if you're so unhappy with your country you should find somewhere else to live.

It is most definitely a NATO country, but that doesn't mean we are using our tax money to start wars. If you even had any idea what NATO forces actually do (train armies in afghanistan to fight local terrorist groups, provide care in natural disasters, fighting somalian pirates etc.) you would maybe understand that not all forces are evil and trying to bomb innocent civilians.
By the way, you should really work on your english. Literally half of the things you just said are incomprehensible.

If you own more than €25000 in euro, gold or cryptocurrency, you have to declare it for capital taxes. Good luck with buying that house of yours worth hundreds of thousand euros without declaring the capital tax. It might be your money, but you still have to pay taxes over it.
