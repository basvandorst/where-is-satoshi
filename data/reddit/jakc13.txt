Can u ping me a link for the meetup. Would it also be worth trying to repost this in /ausbitcoin or even attempt it in /melbourne?

Is he any good? Where in melbourne? I'm looking for a personal trainer at the mo.

No? When I look at a bitcoin chart for the last 30 days or even 6 months it stands out as quite a jump within a 10 hour window?  Not arguing, just surprised me when I logged in to have a look this morning to see such a sharp rise.  
@_date: 2016-06-12 15:08:28
I still dont get it.  If it becomes less profitable to mine, I could understand how some mining might drop, but why would that make me/someone invest more into bitcoin?

Thanks.  Shut intial one down, backed up wallets, just rolled 0.12.1 over the top.  Its picking up on my balance, but have the message 'no block sources available - 21 weeks behind'    The debug window reports 'Number of connections 8(in:0, out:8).   Any idea/good links on how to troubleshoot this or is this to be expected?

Can I send to another online wallet or does it have to finish syncing before it allows this?

Its been reindexing for 10 hours now.  Still no where near complete - 2 years left, only 205mb recieved via network traffic tab.  
Is there anything I can do to speed up the process now that I have 0.12.1?
Looking forward to moving to Electrum.  Bitoin Core is not exactly aimed at the non-tech casual user by the looks of it (albeit im sure it has some amazing tech within it).
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:17:48
not a bad prediction

Looks like some consensus already on Electrum.  Appreciate the noob assistance.
Just updating Bitcoin Core to the latest and catching up on the blockchain.  
To transfer to Electrum, I assume the following steps:
* Wait for Bitcoin Core to catch up
* Download and install Electrum - now have a new wallet address.
* Wait for Electrum to catch up on the Blockchain (sounds like its quicker than Bitcoin Core
* Send all of my BTC from Bitcoin Core Wallet to my Electrum wallet.
* Uninstall Bitcoin Core, backup the new wallet to somewhere secure.
Any other tips?  Ill do some more background reading later this evening.  A lot to catch up on.  Bought a few bitcoins back in Jan 2014 setup some alerts to tell me when it caught back up to what i paid.  That time has come.  Not that i am going to sell, just made me realise I need to getup to date with whats been happening :)

Cool, will read that post now and check out Electrum, not heard of that before.
Ive backed up my wallet, but is there any known issues or common mistakes when transitioning from one wallet to another.  I guess its a new wallet address, so fairly straightforward.  Will look to update Bitcoin Core from 0.10.2 (64bit) to 0.12, is that easy?  Thanks

Not using Tor, and have unchecked 'connect through SOCKS5' and also disabled my windows firewall.  Can see that I am sending &amp; receiving from the network traffic tab.  Ill wait it out for a few hours.  From looking at other posts, some suggest having some luck re-indexing the BlockChain, or starting over with downloading it again...

Can someone provide some theories on why it has jumped up overnight (well overnight for me in Australia).  Im always curious to what causes the fairly sudden jumps.  Was it just a small number of high volume transactions?
@_date: 2016-06-07 10:13:21
0.11.2 looks like the latest stable build, right?
And I assume I should wait until 0.10.2 catches up with the blockchain (at 21 weeks behind and syncing now)

Can someone point me towards a good ELI5 source on how halving would cause a price jump? I understand the basics of why halving happens, but dont understand the correlation to a price jump.

Is there a "catalog" of sites/services that accept BTC ? Been tempted to sell off 50% of what I have but alternatively might just use them for some treat purchases. e.g. Holiday, white goods, Kitchenware, battlefield 1, etc.  I'm in Australia.
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:26:30
Hodler, mine is in Electrum at v2.6.4
I think I will be having a sell off at the week end.  Anything I need to worry about?  Just catching up on everything now.  
With this hard fork stuff, should I be upgrading my wallet, or just forget about everything and check back in a couple of weeks?
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:48:57
Any tips on how to do that please
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:13:13
If one moved my BTC from electrum to an exchange earlier today and sold on, do I still have any BCC left in my electrum wallet?

Your probably right that the bank is the better approach. 
* Would it make a difference if I want to do this perhaps 2 or 3 times a year?
* Would it make a difference if it was 5k? And if so, at what amount would you not use bitcoin and why?
Not trying to hide things, just wondering if bitcoin is actually a better way of moving money from one country to another and skip out on the fees.  Last time I looked they screw you on the exchange rate, it takes a fair bit of time to shift, can be tricky to reverse the process if your not in the country where the money is, and the fees...
