Why don't you plan instead on what you'll do if the bank takes away your house and you find yourself with nothing, which I see a distinct possibility. You're letting your greed overcome common sense.

Coinbase works in the UK. It's easy to use, mobile friendly and they give you a wallet. I can give you a referral link that gives you $10 of bitcoin for free if you buy bitcoin with a new coinbase account.

1. There's a lot of different ways but easiest is Coinbase.
2. Yes
3. Best way is to invest long term. But if you want to make profit short term, then the best time is when the price starts climbing rapidly. When everyone else starts buying, that's when you sell.
4. Again Coinbase
5. There's only one form.
If you do decide to buy Bitcoin, it's extremely easy and just takes a few minutes. For new customers Coinbase offers $10 for free. If you want that bonus send me a PM and I'll send you the link.

Isn't coinbase instant?

It's actually very easy. The exchange that most people use is called coinbase. You just go on their website, set up an account, and buy with your credit card. They give you a wallet and you can keep your bitcoin on their site. As long as you don't give people your account password, the bitcoin will be safe. They also give $10 of bitcoin for free for new customers if you use a referral link I can give you.

One benefit is you don't need a bank account to use it and just need the Internet. Another is that the government can't manipulate it like it does in Venezuela.
If you want to buy some, PM me for a referral link that will get you $10 for free if you buy $100.

That's what I do. In my opinion Bitcoin is a less risky investment than Etherum but no one can really know haha. As for resources, I don't really have anything better than this sub.
If you're going to buy Bitcoin for the first time, I can send you a coinbase referral link that gets us both $10 of bitcoin for free. PM me if interested.

Easiest way is coinbase. It's extremely easy, you just sign up for an account with them, type in the amount you want, click buy.
Most people here will tell you to buy a hardware bitcoin wallet but personally I feel safe just leaving the bitcoin on the coinbase website, especially if it's just a small amount. They're a reputable company and their bitcoin is covered by insurance in case something happens, so it's safe.
 
If you're planning on buying over $100 worth of bitcoin I can send you a referral link that gets you $10 for free.
