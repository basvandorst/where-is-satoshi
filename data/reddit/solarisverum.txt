What we really need is for a "paychex" type company that comes along, that is willing to process payroll for cheaper than the current ones by using BTC to cut out transaction fees.
This way, workers could opt to receive their money in BTC -- over time you could incentivize it and start the economy transition.  
If Coinbase doesn't get on this... I will -- haha.

Now here’s the twist, and there is a twist: We show it. We show all of it. Because what’s the one major thing missing from all bitcoin auctions these days guys?

no.  you have to think of it as "canceling out" the lobbying sh*tstorm against btc that is about to take place when the banks and credit card companies feel threatened.  
so long as there is lobbying "equilibrium" -- grassroots btc usage (and its inherent efficiency) will trump the campaign of misinformation everytime.

Ha! I'll be sure to look in the next federal register for the fda's notice of proposed rulemaking.

The only way to get these guys to do anything is to scare them.  
I'm really surprised that a superpac crowd funded by BTC's hasn't popped up pledging to drop a million dollars into TV ads against this idiot.  
Anyways, this guy is too busy sucking on the teet of coal companies to know anything about technology.  Probably doesn't own a computer.

I am saying that lobbying against a grassroots movement by the trillion dollar industry can crush the grassroots movement if its unchecked.  
The relative costs (in dollars) for the credit card cos/banks to spend money demonizing btc (and supporting legislation to empower the NSA to take down btc at all costs) are far less than the relative costs to evangelize and explain its benefits (in time spent). 
Simply put, you need a two-front war for socio-economic progress: if you don't fight lobbying cash with lobbying cash, a well funded smear campaign and tsunami of advertising can crush the grassroots movement before it catches on.

This analysis seems legally incorrect: 
1) usually regulations only create civil, not criminal liability 2) any interpretation to incriminate him/them would be an unconstitutional ex post facto law and violate due process 3) New York probably lacks personal jurisdiction over "Satoshi"

it seems to me that the constitution was amended and the government took away the right to drink during prohibition from 1920 to 1930...

Is there any way to check the source code/meta markup on the ad to see why its coming up when you google "bitcoin mcdonalds"?

The problem is the word "Randomly."  That makes me think that they'll accept a hug or something for every n-th customer.

Not under the present US Constitution.  It would be considered "coining money," which is only allowed by the Federal Gov. 
Article I Section 10:
No state shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation; grant letters of marque and reprisal; coin money; emit bills of credit; make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts, or grant any title of nobility.

Rule 401. Test for Relevant Evidence -- Federal Rules of Evidence
Evidence is relevant if:
(a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence; and
(b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.
