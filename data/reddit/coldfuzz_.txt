Don't you think it's inevitable?
@_date: 2019-07-20 07:02:02
When do you think that will be?
@_date: 2019-07-21 01:15:30
Sounds like something that would start riots...
@_date: 2019-07-21 01:19:44
Here's the thing tho if i store it on a paper wallet literally nobody would know and have no access to it
@_date: 2019-07-21 00:47:31
It's also on a piece of paper
@_date: 2019-07-20 07:03:00
Doesn't that sound like the whales that could be moving the prices?
@_date: 2019-07-21 01:20:43
So they wouldn't even be able to seize them in the first place.
@_date: 2019-07-20 00:14:59
What's the whole process?
@_date: 2019-07-17 23:33:09
If you want to see my work.
@_date: 2019-07-17 23:52:03
Not really what I do, but open to some tfp work aswell.

Also that means a country sees it as a good store of value to use it to back the dollar.
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:06:12
I don't think it works like that. That means the price of Bitcoin will skyrocket because bow there is 1.2m btc less off the markets. And demand won't go down so.....
@_date: 2019-07-21 00:14:07
I don't keep it an exchange it's on my computer
I'm also in Canada btw
@_date: 2019-07-20 07:05:39
So it's inevitable that the price will sky rocket because of this?
@_date: 2019-07-20 07:11:58
When do you think it will rocket to the moon?
@_date: 2019-07-20 07:17:35
Do you think it's can play out like that
@_date: 2019-07-04 09:11:06
That's what i was initially doing and worked out great. I just got greedy. Now I know, to just be patient and let Bitcoin do its thing.
@_date: 2019-07-20 07:06:13
@_date: 2019-07-04 09:10:02
Now I know to stay far far away from there.
Lesson learnt. Albeit an expensive expensive one.
@_date: 2019-07-20 07:01:14
It goes to the local and provincial, which is pretty similar.
@_date: 2019-07-20 06:58:53
@_date: 2019-07-04 17:00:04
I wish i was just down 20.
But it's alot worse.
@_date: 2019-07-04 09:12:41
It comes from a place of greed and fear.
I seen the dark and the light, I'm just gonna play it safer and be more patient with it.

I work in a product photography studio for
 during the week, but also freelance on the weekends doing portraits and events.
@_date: 2019-07-21 01:33:25
Yup alittle different but i get your point
@_date: 2019-07-04 22:08:57
I lost an amount that hurt pretty bad but not the end of the world.
I'm going to stay far away from margin trading now.
But im all for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-20 07:21:53
Then we're early huh
@_date: 2019-07-04 22:06:55
Sounds like some good coke
@_date: 2019-07-20 07:06:03
But you think it's inevitable?
@_date: 2019-07-05 01:44:34
@_date: 2019-07-20 07:07:09
You don't think there are countries buying now?
@_date: 2019-11-07 22:34:38
That's different from being a bank, anybody can give you a loan. We're talking about being able to hold your own money and have it increase in value like a savings account.
@_date: 2019-06-13 11:46:30
No ine has the answer for this
@_date: 2019-09-03 04:07:06
Don't do it
