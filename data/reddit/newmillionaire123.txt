I've been reading about taxes too. I've held my coin long-term, so it is 15% flat tax and no short term capital gains tax. I need to figure out what to do with the time I have. I will definitely do something worth-wile with my limited skill set.

300k$ was my savings goal for retirement. I did not factor a home into that equation. Also, the neighborhood I am from people retire with a balance of less than 100k$(my uncle recently did).

I got in before the boom in 2011 for a little above 1$. I went through the crash and never looked at it till march this year. I've been holding it since then continously checking price day-in/day-out. Enough of monitoring for me now.

yes, that would make sense. I would at-least be giving back something to the network that made this possible.

That would be a nice idea if I want to keep track of what is going on. But I really really want to get out of it. I need to put a stop to my greed. I am sure I will regret selling out some day... but may be it is for the best.

I don't think you cannot comprehend my situation right now. I feel sick just thinking of having 2 million. I do not want 10 million. Heck, I do not want 2 million. I could live a comfortable life with 300k$. That was my goal for a retirement. I will most probably be donating the rest of the money. But before that, I need to take a break from all of this.
