That's the reason we have done it! Currently they ARE destroying everything but due to the lack of recycleing and sanitation this include expensive hospital beds. What out goal was to make the beds inexpensive enough that you COULD have 5 flat-packed IMP beds, waiting for more patients rather than turning people away at the door as they have [been]( It's not just the beds we are funding but also the shipment of over $800,000 dollars worth of medical aid and food supplies that Stand4Salone raised earlier this year but lacked the funds to send over!

We are looking at supply sanitary bedding sheets along side the beds, but sadly as many of these countries dont have the sanitation materials to clean them thoroughly enough after every use they HAVE to destroy all the equipment used!

Thanks! The team and I appreciate the support big time, it's our first project so any criticism is constructive at the moment!

Because our bed is so cheap we will free up funds for other companies to purchase medical supplies and food instead of beds that they are spending to much money on!

We were motivated by [Isaiah Lahai]( who had lost 8 of his family and yet was still so passionate to make a difference for his country and we realised we could help make a tangible difference. Not taking away from the seriousness of malaria but this was a way we felt we were actually doing something!
We aren't just giving money to the victims we are trying to establish a new improved [bedding]( solution which has the potential to help other disaster relief scenarios in the future.

we did, it was obvious - but not viable.

No problem, you find a little bit about Stand4Salone and there first shipment [here]( as well as the business details [here]( .
Thanks for the advice, at this stage Stand4Salone doesn't have a website themselves, so [ours]( gives some information. 
We have live a radio broadcast locally on Monday which can be put up as well as newspapers articles that will be added soon!
As a first time venture for us all we're learning a lot quickly so any advice is appreciated!

We sure have, the first validation we got was speaking to Isaiah Lahai, who straight away affirmed what we were doing and believed it was a terrific idea to raise awareness as well as help with shipping the aid they already have! He said specifically that shelter was often not thought about and instead most support went for medical and food aid! 
The trial beds have not been set yet (although they have been slept on) but we have had them examined by medical professionals and disaster aid workers! with this this first shipment as a proof of concept we hope to be able to supply the IMP bed at such a low cost other disaster Aid relief efforts in the future!
It literally is 'More beds' needed, as they are destroying the ones they have! Treatment and care facilities are needed as well, but this was a way that us 3 as University students from a little Island called Tasmania at the bottom of Australia felt WE could make difference.
Thanks for the kind words, we appreciate the support so much!

We'll be getting bitcoin's name out there in to the community for people who may not have used it before. At the moment we are working on adding links and the logo to show just how easy it is to create an account and start using it! If this campaign can get funded and the beds are sent, thanking the bitcoin community will be something we'll have to do!
