Good correction. BAB has an owner, and this owner is roger.
It has hitherto survived out of a triple domain ownership: bitcoin.com, r/btc, 
The latter is apparently lost, the BAB castle is eroding.

Small correction, it is **BAB** now!

r/buttcoin is full of BABers from r/btc, including shitlord AMA REE C'estShit

Did he eat calvin's dick? Or sued the price of bitcoin? Or murdered the genesis block? I'm lost :P

Don't muddy the waters.
You are trying to mix up the anti-government bitcoin stance with an insolvent corrupt exchange. This is very dishonest, bitfinex/usdt is NOT the same as bitcoin in any way. All the more reason as to why this tether shit needs to end.
@_date: 2019-04-18 15:55:16
Yes, it is pathetic now, it wasn't pathetic before the BCH split. Calling it names won't help in anything. The situation now for BAB is far more desperate than it was for BCH pre-split. When that happens, one can expect rising rates of fraud and market manipulation, and we are testifying those right now.

Your reply is very ignorant. I'll just pick some passages


+1 million coins "insignificant"? Full stop.


You are denying very objective data I posted, and you seem sure about everything you are saying. How do you know? A video with Ver already getting offended with "bcash" name during an interview in august 2017. Why was he already offended? Tell me, wasn't him full segwit2x? 
And, according to you, he simply found out that the biggest miner in bitcoin's history was creating the fork he failed to create with XT and BU and simply kept himself aside?


It clearly doesn't follow anything, you just tossed some argument that he switched to bch after segwit cancellation, which is provably false, and then you say it follows he had nothing at all to do with anything prior to that. You are presenting unfounded opinions as facts.


Are you suggesting that the flippening attempt was an "accident"? Really, you are trying to convince me that the price of bch simply pumped by market demand and that EDA algo just happened to have a profitability sweet spot that kept going **even when hash was 50% but bch price was still half**? Do you see how illogical your reasoning is?


Calling something a "conspiracy bullshit" is low-effort trolling. You didn't provide anything relevant but only opinions as they were facts. Go watch carefully the video, RV clearly was behind BCH and the facts which unfolded since then amply suggest this.
@_date: 2019-04-18 12:11:18
Well, supposedly they have BSV as well due to the split. Would you burn money for no apparent gain? No.
They would crash BSV only if that meant it would increase their BAB value in the same proportion. As of now, BAB pumped from dwindling 100 bucks to 300 bucks, and BSV remained around the 60, they might dump it.
But keep in mind one thing: if you are an exchange operator and the system alerts you that 100k+ coins were just deposited in your platform, you would *turn off your trading bots for pairs with those coins*, wouldn't ya?
@_date: 2019-04-16 20:37:56
No way bitmain sold 1 million coins of any fork whatsoever, there's no liquidity.
I think bitmain dumped a lot of BCH during 2018, *but not even close to enough* as they cannot pay their suppliers and chip manufacturers already sold capacity to other clients (excluding bitmain). 
They dumped more BAB and litecon during these last pumps, but this is low for such stash.
@_date: 2019-04-17 00:53:28
They do exactly the same. RV forced his ownership of bitcoin.com with lawyers if you don't know. I think has the references.
Binance threatened people with a lawsuit because they criticized binance: 
The irony of all of this is appalling. I just posted this video in the daily rCC thread and got *less than 1 second* down votes and someone calling me "craig". :)
@_date: 2019-04-17 22:16:53






You definitely cannot see. This is what scammers like Roger do, they attract people like you with "reasonable talk". When you dig it, it is mostly lies and reality bending to fit a narrative.
BCH doesn't work ---&gt; devs are centralized, incompetent obscure "anarchy" preachers and do not know what a logical shift is. They can't even keep their own roadmap and invent last minute bullshit to save face, like copying the uninteresting part of schnorr and pushing CTOR. They claim to be "the thing", yet they copy blockstream roadmap? Get the fuck out!
Mining is done inorganically only for pumps and the aftermath dump, it never really attracted a significant portion of sha256 so it is more fragile than litecoin or ethereum. You can thank Jihan for this one, all of his projects failed, the funny thing is that his projects didn't even include BCH, save the wormhole crap. It is because all he ever wanted was the IPO heist and dump embezzled BCH onto Hong Kong investors .
Well, bitmain just recently got toasted again, they lost the IPO. **As a result, everyone holding BCHBAB is  pretty much holding bitmain liabilities.**
Avalanche will be definitely DDoS'd in the first days of liveliness, to salvage it, it will become checkpoint permissioned staking.
On top of that, nearly all the adoption is fake and pretty much limited to a whale in NQ donating coins to his pals in a single restaurant and occasional chopper trip.
But, according to BABers, since Craig is a fraud all of the above is false, BTC will die and they will be get-rich-quick millionaires. They just need to wait bitmain offload some 800,000/1,000,000 coins first.
@_date: 2019-04-17 23:03:42


Part of the reason it is like this is because BAB implements checkpoints with them. It is PoIP: exchanges and miners set up trusted intranets to feed the 11-th BAB block head to each other. It is an utter waste of energy and they could pretty much migrate to a synchronous timestamp server with redundancy.
In the real world, BAB having 5% of sha256 would demand 20x as much confirmations, that would be 120 confirmations if BTC demands 6.
@_date: 2019-04-18 10:49:03
I agree, I don't think bitmain wants to crash the BSV market. But they might crash it if this means increasing BAB/LTC value, flipping one coin for the other. (bitmain also has big stashes of LTC and scrypt miners)
RV shills are surreptitiously infiltrating rCC and they never left this sub. They have the same plan as always: to make the rejection smaller but, it turns out, when RV pumps BAB others dump BAB. It is not an easy situation.
@_date: 2019-04-17 20:02:59
They can't sell them all, there is no liquidity, no real money to absorb 1 million BAB priced at ~300. And there's no way to sell it all in the open market without a crash. Throughout 2018 they did sell lots of them and this is why BCH crashed several times, but realize this: it was *not* enough, they still downsized a lot, got a line of creditors after them and lost production slots in chip manufacturers' plants. Ultimately, they lost the IPO, which just recently expired without approval.
@_date: 2019-04-25 08:29:21
It is off topic regarding the mod rules of not mentioning altcoins, what I think is fair. But it is very on topic since the same scammers still have influence on BTC by mining it, selling ASICs, and especially keeping the bitcoin.com domain, the  twitter handle and a sub with bitcoin ticker rBTC.
So I decided to risk posting this so that people get informed. How many noobs do you think end up in bitcoin.com and rBTC, or following  in twitter? Don't you think this shit needs to end?
@_date: 2019-04-18 13:10:29
Yep, but that's Roger's goal. He will keep trying the flippening. You see, there was no one buying BAB. All of a sudden, BAB jumps from dwindling 100 bucks to 300 bucks in wash trading, and hash increased.
A good savage pump could snatch plenty of hash to BAB. Unfortunately, the more advanced countries are the first to ban or overtax mining, so the chinese will keep going even if China clamps more and more miners in mongolia.
This means a constant flippening threat.
@_date: 2019-04-17 00:09:19
Kraken is controlled by RV, they will never delist BAB. Kraken was involved in the "hash war" ticker co-opt. 
And not only that, ALL businesses that delisted BSV in a blink of an eye have RV involvement, to name a few:
binance - RV was an "advisor" to their ICO and investor;
kraken - RV is a major seed investor;
Blockchain - this is even worse, RV not only is an investor, *this is the origin of RV getting bitcoin.com domain* after blockchain.info "lost client funds" in online wallets and "decided" to pass the domain to "another entity". This is the only reason that scammer got the bitcoin.com domain.
TL;DR: you are all cheering RV market manipulation. You can get rid of bozo, but you can't get rid of the "save the BABies" scammer who will endure co-opting BTC market share with scams, misleading propaganda and PnD.
@_date: 2019-04-16 05:22:52
Stop talking about "enabled csw". RV is a far far deeper scammer than csw+calvin squared. You might hate craig, he is a dick for sure, but analyze facts: sv never manipulated the markets with swing mining, fake promises and etc. They only talked shit on twitter and made some wannabee bitcoin celebs face lawsuit.
They enabled RV, it was the opposite. And they abandoned him as soon as they realized who he is.
RV is behind all the delisting of BSV (all businesses that rushed to follow binance have RV investment and influence), he is behind all the bitmain dump and if you think this is good, remember you gave him even more power to manipulate the market and you are helping to salvage bitmain from bankruptcy.
You will swallow RV talking shit about BTC until the end of the days, until the final con, which is flipping BTC with BAB, happens.
@_date: 2019-04-17 22:52:29
I'll give you the most honest advice possible: hodl what RV/Jihan do **not** have, but keep a small portion of what they pump to trade their scam.
Mid-long term BAB is dead, short term they will try to pump it in low volume many times over. There will probably be the usual pre-fork wash trading pump, it is traditional. If you have coins, pace that well and dump it without looking back. Then re-access.
@_date: 2019-04-17 20:31:42
RV is the backbone of BAB, this is very transparent. Remove him, BAB withers and die.
Until crypto gets rid of these swindlers, kiss the ETF goodbye. Don't think that you have the luxury to seat idle, "winning over BAB" doesn't mean shit to the external world.
@_date: 2019-04-16 23:58:48
I 100% agree with it is yet another publicity stunt by the desperate scammers full of BAB to dump since bitmain bankruptcy. Oh, and don't forget that OP, contrarian, is a BAB shill and likely involved with deadalnix.
You must not let RV astroturfing get out of hand here, his shill agency **bitcoinX.io** is full of socks now trying to legitimize BAB among BTCers by joining up the mob. They are doing this in rCC and there's a mod there I think they control/bought.
ps: if there was still an iota of doubt on how much an opportunist RV is:

You said 


and I'm saying that's not true.
@_date: 2019-04-26 03:43:18


This really really reads like "lost". Between the lines (not so between tho): they admit they didn't know where the funds were and that it came to their knowledge (post facto) that in fact the funds were **seized**. Their own words.
@_date: 2019-04-16 18:51:39
I think you get it perfectly. The real danger is the opposite of a guy who's *transparently* a dickhead (csw), it is RV pretending he's in this to "save the BABies".
He bought the bitcoin.com domain and, subsequently, the bitcoinX.io professional shill agency to do astroturfing, not to help the coin, but to help raise his profile.
If he wanted competitive development, he would have done seed investment to something rival to blockstream in a similar professional setup.
BTW, Roger Ver did try to enter politics around the 2000's, but he wasn't elected and then he went to serve jail time.
In his interview with Carvallo you can see who he really is when he starts to bash the guy because he makes less than 1 million dollars per year in revenue and that he (RV) was already a multimillionaire when he joined bitcoin. RV is the true narcissist.
@_date: 2019-04-18 13:22:09
Have you noticed that almost all businesses that rushed to delist BSV have RV grubby paws' touch? Kraken, Binance, Blockchain, Shapeshift ...
Don't hold your breath for the delisting of BAB ...
@_date: 2019-09-18 06:36:46


Where did he prove such thing??
@_date: 2019-05-02 00:35:31
Also important to notice the fraudulent misrepresentation nature of the bcash upgrade. It is not enough to point that this is a copy&amp;paste low-effort basic minimal code. It has being sold as a great solution for many things *which won't be there*. This is a repeated fraud already done around CTOR.
Not-enough-scrutinized code that may result in loss of funds that neither roger, nor deadphoenix will repair is even worse. Although we can agree that the [functions are so minimal]( one would be surprised if they manage to break something...
