We believe that Wells wouldn't have wasted the energy on a 'summit' unless they were growing curious.  Otherwise, they would outright dismiss Bitcoin.

Thanks for the heads-up.  Been corrected to USD.  Thanks!

You did great Andreas.  Had the same experience staring into a blank teleprompter that says "look here" with no other visual feedback.  It is unnerving to say the least.  We need 2 more of you!

We would be glad to consider your listing at BitPremier!  Please send us an email at sales
Hope to be hearing from you!

Funny thing happens when you post unsubstantiated rumors on Reddit --&gt; you get attitude.  You are wasting a whole lot of breath on a non-issue which I have made very clear.  Done with your nonsense. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:44:35
The information is being deleted. It hasn't been sold.  Consequently, you wasted a lot of hot air on nothing and just seem like a troll with nothing better to do than cause problems.  There isn't one client satoshi at risk and not one character of data going anywhere. Nobody "dropped the ball" as nobody was harmed. Hope you feel better now.  Wouldn't want to upset boatyboatmcboatface.

I never post on Reddit, but this nonsense just begs a response.  Personal information has never been sold or divulged by BitPremier and that won't change with the sale of the company.  Your post is baseless and ridiculous.

"Literally an invasion of privacy" 
Hmm, is that what it's called when people deliberately register on the site and provide their email address, then deliberately upload information for public viewing?  That's funny, I thought invasion of privacy meant something different.
Carry on.

The twins' fund has only been submitted for SEC approval.  It won't be a competing factor for a long time.  They have many more hurdles with a public vehicle.

Seller sold the Ferrari for USD unfortunately outside of our site.  Our listings are non-exclusive for now.  More cars getting listed soon though!
@_date: 2013-06-18 19:19:45
  We will take this into consideration.  Thanks for the input!

We list real estate, among other luxury items, on BitPremier.  Real estate laws vary by jurisdiction, so a conversation is involved every time real estate is listed.  We have some amazing properties listed!

Real estate is amongst our other luxury listings on BitPremier.  Currently have real estate in Bali, Barcelona, Grand Bahama Island, and St. Moritz.

This is significant.  Fortress manages $55B in assets.  Novogratz is Fortress's Principal and on BOD.

For regular individual investors, maybe.  Not for accredited investors and institutions that will find these fees market appropriate.  I am surprised at how many "excessively high fees" comments I am seeing - from investors in a currency that swings 1% in value on most days much less years.  Something to think about.  2% is nothing for a large bitcoin purchase.
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:40:32
 is up and running.  why?
@_date: 2013-09-26 02:16:24
They have access to all major exchanges, as well as large private pools of bitcoins, etc.

I broadcasted SecondMarket's tweet. Can't give any details beyond that. Just stay tuned at 8pm.

At BitPremier we list luxury vehicles!  We currently have a handful of luxury cars listed, with more on the way.  Check out BitPremier!

Of course.  As with any other purchase, you are naturally responsible for paying any relevant sales taxes, registration fees, etc. in USD or the local currency.  Using bitcoins doesn't preclude you from those responsibilities.
@_date: 2013-09-26 02:23:03
An institution or large investor with a potentially market-moving bitcoin purchase won't hesitate for a minute for a 2% annual fee.  2% is market-appropriate in this space and for the intended target market.  A wealthy investor isn't going to monkey around on Coinbase or Gox trying to push a $1M purchase through, and to handle their own security, verification, etc.  There is nothing out there that matches this vehicle for them - this is a big development.  If you want to make a $1,000 purchase, go use Coinbase.  This isn't for small purchases.  And for what it's worth, if one trust owns all bitcoins by 2060, I think it is safe to say that bitcoins failed as an experiment, and we have bigger problems.
@_date: 2013-06-18 16:32:21
Should have more cars listed soon.  Stay tuned!

The owner has decided not to rent it at this time.  We wanted to know as well!  Beautiful property.

We beg to differ.  Buying a car or anything else in bitcoins, Euros, USD, or any currency is not an income tax event in the U.S., unless you are receiving some kind of income or consideration in return.  This is written in current tax laws.

Loose translation from a Mandarin-speaking colleague:
Baidu opens the service of Bitcoin Transaction
       Oct 15, 2013
As a modern IT person and a Web manager, what will make me distinguishing among my peers? The answer is of course the Bitcoin!!!
Bitcoin, which is the newly arising digital currency, has gained significant international recognition and is part of everyday life in some areas of the world. It can be used for a cup of coffee, or for the exchange of gold and silver. But in China, Bitcoin is still regarded as something that is “fashionable or trendy”. Today, I’ve got good news for everyone: beginning on October 14, 2013, Baidu will officially provide the service of Bitcoin transactions. Baidu users can use Bitcoin for service payments. As the first Wed-based company in China that provides digital currency transactions, Baidu will bring you the richer experience of web-based transactions with Bitcoins. 
Baidu will continue to strive to bring more methods that will enable the customers a better and more convenient transaction experience! 
Address for Baidu SuperSpeed Joy Bitcoin transactions:

This came out absolutely incredible gang!  Congrats!

Thanks for the comment.  On a personal level, and especially with social media and internet transparency these days, it is easy to vet my credentials.  I have worked at large financial institutions for over 15 years and can provide many personal references.  You will not find anything, on the internet or otherwise, that puts into question my high ethical and moral standards.  The company is also backed by the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, which backs other well-known names in the Bitcoin space, and likewise operates with the highest of standards.  Glad to answer any other questions you may have.  Feel free to contact me through the site or at support  I am well connected in the Bitcoin community and plan on being around for many years to come as the space evolves and matures!  -Alan Silbert

Yes, the 911 was sold.  We are trying to find another 911 to list.
