I’m very concerned about the ranking of Nigeria. That volume in a country with a low purchasing power would likely indicate a high level of crime related transactions / money laundering

You do realise that there are people who literally made millions with bitcoin and can easily buy multiple lambos. No rentals.

I’d say to buy back in now. Having your money sitting around waiting for a potential drop is a waste of potential gains. If you’re not confident in BTC right now you could set up a portfolio of alts and try to recover the 25% or even more.

I’d be worried if he was praising bitcoin for the very reason you mentioned: he just doesn’t get tech stuff. He didn’t believe in Google - it was an insane success. He didn’t believe in Amazon - it was an equally insane success (and there is still so much more to come). I’m sure you get where I’m going with this...
@_date: 2018-05-05 10:34:07
Yep, that’s me
@_date: 2018-10-10 11:54:06
Interesting. Would be even more interesting to see a similar analysis for other coins 
@_date: 2018-10-27 09:10:53
Agreed. Unless you still have money in the stick market the making thing will be to make sure you’ve got good employment to feed the family. If you end up with spare money that doesn’t go towards bills or education then you can always buy some bitcoin for the long run

I thought the same. Might be people being curious about just how much the average investor lost since the beginning of the year due to some of the negative press these days

Aussie here too. I used CoinJar for my first purchase. They are local and offer 0% fees on bpay and you can link your bank account to cash out.
@_date: 2019-08-26 09:48:28
Yeah that doesn’t sound right. I’d recommend getting started by buying some of your own via coinbase or another exchange that you feel comfortable with.

And I’m guessing they’ll regret it in 2019 when we’re back up at 10k plus (hopefully!!)
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:38:03
That wasn’t the question but I’m glad you got your moment to shine too. I’m sorry to hear that you’re not in this for the long run.
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:38:15
Huh? A 15k prediction is optimistic...
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:14:57
Same! 
Bought another 100 bucks when it went under 5k and have no regrets at all (despite the further drop since then). I’m in this for the long run. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:16:28
What if it never goes below 1000?
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:16:37
Or... learn a lesson and stay 
@_date: 2018-07-03 10:34:12
It depends on your country. I’m in Australia and we have a few pretty reliable and trustworthy apps (exchanges) that you can transfer money to in order to buy coins. 
Some of our banks also allow us to use card payments with Coinbase (I’m assuming you heard of this exchange by now?). If your bank lets you make payments to Coinbase I’d recommend you start there. It’s very user friendly for your first few steps into crypto land :)

Start with small numbers and learn your lessons before you get more serious.  And even then, never invest more than you can afford to lose.

A short futures contract is the scenario where you bet on the value of the crypto falling
A long futures contract is the opposite; here you bet on it raising.
The term “short” and “long” have nothing to do with short/long term. Just in case you may have misunderstood.

It’s a one day old account and that is the only post so far. Chances are this is a bot or something...
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:16:37
Haha, fair enough. Why the new account?
Re things being different:
I actually agree with you on that. One of the differences now is that people started trading short/long positions which wasn’t a thing not too long ago. This changes market dynamics as well. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:11:32
Interesting thought. Basically there is no chance to buy it because everyone who has it is either holding or only trading with people who already have it. Fascinating 
@_date: 2018-04-14 09:53:37
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:32:13
That would be interesting because so far we value bitcoin in fiat. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 12:31:57
I’ve heard of both, index fund type investments as well as classic long/short positions
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:31:23
The thing is... no matter how much you buy the rich will buy more and always stay richer
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:43:18
Right there with you
