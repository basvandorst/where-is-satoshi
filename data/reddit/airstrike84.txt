If you guys think the price is going to go down and want to capitalize on it then you can short bitcoin. I suggest using bitfinex.com they offer leveraged margin trading to triple your buying power for short and long positions, with fees of .15% per trade. They also trade on stamp for increased liquidity.
Also, this is how you short once you have an account there.
Step by step.
Load your "Trade" wallet with funds. These will be used to backup your loan (and will be deducted in case of a loss). I'm pretty sure this only works with BTC/LTC and not fiat. (some one correct me if i'm wrong).
When you think you have found your sweet spot, enter a sell amount and place your order at either market or place a limit order at a fixed price. This essentially initiates a "loan" and automatically you borrow BTC/LTC and your position is entered in the system.
In "open positions" you will see the value of your position. It always starts negative because of the spread. In order to profit on a short the buy price must go lower than your original sell order price.
To reduce the position or sell out slowly, enter buy orders again from the margin trading tab. To completely close the position you can simply click "close" next to "current positions" tab where your open position is listed.
Tips In times of low volume, be careful buying and selling large amounts. Even small orders of ~5 btc will effect price during low volume. You can stagger your orders over time in small increments.
Set some kind of stop loss. You can use limit, stop, or trailing stop orders to do this. For more info on how they work check out investopedia.
Be careful trading on margin! Your losses as well as profits are amplified. You can set your margin requirements in user settings. I suggest starting with 1:1 and then moving up as you get more comfortable.
Finally, never play with more than you can afford to lose. I have a fixed % i trade with and that's it. You may get some big wins, but always remember you will inevitably lose big as well. Keep track of your data as bitfinex logs suck. That way you will have a more accurate layout of how your doing.
Good luck!
If you use my reference code when signing up you will save another 10% off all trading fees. Here ya go RAgkOOFTJL

Yes, to start off under account options you can choose the leverage, they give you 3 options, going from lowest risk and reward to highest risk and reward. 
To short make sure you have money in your trading account, then go to the margin trading tab.
On the right side of the screen you will see how much lent money you have to work with.
To short place a margin sell order, when you want to close your position you can either hit the close position button or place a margin buy order and you can place a limit on the price you want to buy the BTC back for. Once all the coins are repurchased back your position is closed.

I still don't have any coins.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:31:03
It isn't showing any received. Could it just be that Bitfinex is slow?
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:28:31
Yes, I'm from the U.S. It is U.S. friendly.
Do you have bitcoins or do you want to buy bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:49:34
Yea, same with me.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:10:50
Yea, I'm not sure whats going on, I tried to deposit $1000 a few days ago and It said it was above the limit, I kept trying different dollar amounts and after I tried $500 it said nothing about a limit.

Hey rotaercz, 
All of my friends and I use Bitfinex.com, we have been using it for 3-4 months and have it no issues what so ever except for the occasional lag with high traffic every couple days but every one has that. Bitfinex is an exceptional platform allowing normal trading, and margin trading for taking short/long positions on BTC and LTC. They also let you lend/borrow LTC, BTC, and USD. The fees are the lowest out there at 0.12 per trade, and if you use my code **RAgkOOFTJL** you get 10% off that trading fee for a month. No one can beat that.

I have been with them for about a month. I love their platform because they have the lowest fees (0.12%) per trade and they offer margin trading and lending which I love to use. If you use this RAgkOOFTJL code you get 10% off trading fees for a month which is pretty cool.
