you have failed at countering my arguments or provide me one example of a better project.
@_date: 2019-07-20 18:41:56
Oh wait, your 1. and 2. are the same thing right?
Typical brain-dead orangutan.
Speculation is not an use-case. Try reading the definition of utility please.
We can gamble with 2 piles of shit, it doesn't mean we are using the shit for anything. How did you get through elementary school brother?
@_date: 2019-07-20 17:49:10
I will help you point by point, tell me where am I wrong?  
Show me a better project than BSV, scalable, compliant and with real use-cases. No ICO scams and cryptokitties.  
Fact is, BTC has no utility. Some will argue hodling is a use-case, but it isn't. You can hodl a piece of shit, that does not mean you are using it.  
Give me one utility case for BTC. Just one buddy.  
BSV can be used as cash, it can be used for big data, it can be used for smart contracts, it is compliant, transactions have all the necessary components of legal contracts, BTC killed this with Segwit as you don't get the signatures of sender/receiver which are needed for compliance in financial transactions.  
RBF and non-SPV + small blocks killed the usage as cash.  
ETH doesn't scale.   
Now, I bet you will resort to ad hominem attack me, because I am 100% right, I do my own research- i don't listen to your favorite BTC crime gurus. Prove me wrong with facts about the technology or shut up.
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:01:54
Except SegWit failed to convince 65% of nodes.
Less than &lt;35% of nodes adopted SegWit for this and other reasons.
And, You are confusing witness with signature data my friend.
Pity, as you sound somewhat competent, you just needed to go the extra mile- go back and study that stuff again brother, it'll save you years of wasted time, then again-- it is not my responsability to save you. Peace.

kirbyyyyyyyy is actually right, BTC is not scalable. 5 transactions per second with 5 dollar fees per tx is not scalable.  
Lightning network has money transmitting law problems and network topology is incredibly inefficient.   
Totally not scalable neither legally compliant, both BTC and lightning netowrk.
@_date: 2019-07-20 17:37:36
Well, you shouldn't buy eth because of vitalik and you shouldnt buy BTC because of theymos/gmaxwell/adamback who have a history of crime.  
But none of those are willing to show up in court.  
Craig has.  
Do what you guys will but you only get one chance to bet on satoshi nakamoto before you get rekt into oblivion.  
BTC killed instant transactions with RBF + small blocks.   
BTC killed regulatory compliance with SegWit.  
BTC killed usage for big data storage with Small blocks too.  
Satoshi always said eventually we would need big blocks and miners would be big server farms.  
Most don't even understand the difference between pseudonimity and anonimity.  
You can not possibly want anonymity in financial transactions, the only to benefit is tax evaders, criminals and money launderers. They rest are unaffected. This will never be tolerated.  
All you will get is Privacy, so only merchant and yourself will know you bought a dildo. But not anonimity. Very different.  
Anarchy doesn't work, we have tried that,   
You have a problem with your government? man up and help changing it from within.  
Kicking gorilla in the nuts is no way to go about things.  
Start being honest, transparency, law, this brings freedom.  
Not anonimity and hiding and ignoring the law.  
Start reading a book people, seriously.   
I'll recommend 'The Republic' by Plato.  
Start there, then you might start to understand why there is zero chance BTC will ever succeed.

no, do you even know with Segwit means? here is some education for non-techies like you.
Segregated Witness (SegWit) separates—or “segregates”—the witness data away from the transaction data, which allows bitcoin’s blockchain to fully read and record the details of the transaction before releasing any actual bitcoins.
In doing so, however, SegWit doesn’t include the witness data on the blockchain—including so-called “signature data” which verifies that both the buyer and seller agreed to enter into the specific bitcoin transaction.
 Go read and learn of segwit code before you troll here.
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:11:58
Nope. I've gone through all these so-called 'proofs' by idiots like Lopp.   
I can debunk every single one of these 'claims'.  
Just a bunch of girls talking smack and gossiping without evidence.  
Show me just one evidence of scamming that actually holds to scrutiny.   
You can't, because There isn't. I've done all the homework.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:36:23
Oh really? because I did a 1,250 USD transaction yesterday and the fees were 1/5th of a cent.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:05:21
1.- The timetracker on that website is unreliable, that is not correctly measuring what matters for tx propagation.
2.- Yes, double-spends are possible - in that the user can get away with double-spending a FEE, not double-spending a balance. Learn what double spending means.
3.- It is incredibly difficult to do and not worth the cost. I dare you to try.
4.- Online merchants can accept 0-conf transactions no problem as long as they implement a 45sec delay between purchase and confirming of tx to delivery of product/service.
Offline merchants same, you have 45 seconds - the time you have to create and deliver that coffeee for your client to make sure he doesn't step out the door.
If you are doing big transactions, just go for 1-conf. No need to do 0-conf all the time. 
This is the beauty of bitcoin cash, you only have to take as much risk as you want, depending on risk profile.
But trolls gonna troll i suppose.

I agree with you most users won't be able to run nodes - it will be big server farms, yet enough to be decentralized - just not for the average user.
Not everyone has to be a doctor or a marketer or financial analyst - same reason not everyone should be a miner. 
Capitalism does bring competition which provides innovation - the same one that has allowed all your technology to flourish. 
Socialism, I just don't see it happening neither would I want it do.
This all comes with an obsession for decentralization - yes decentralization is good, but it doesn't mean everything (including mining) should be decentralized. Miners will mine, therapists will provide therapy, not everyone should or ought to be everything.
There'll be enough mining farms to make it decentralized enough for you - that is no worry at all.
@_date: 2018-06-12 09:54:17
Wrong... do you actually know how that works? Run me through your calculations - it'll be amusing.
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:28:19
**You are still misleading, because if you use the Bitcoin Core fees of right now, like you are doing with Bitcoin cash for your calculations.... then it would be cheaper with bitcoin cash.**
The only reason your calculations turn out cheaper for BTC is because you are choosing to use the tx fees of days ago when both were cheaper, and now you want to use the more expensive ones of today just for bitcoin cash.
Also Bitcoin cash transactions are instant in one hop.
Not two hops like bitcoin core where you have to open a channel (and takes a long time) and then you get instant with LN..
NONO... instant from the only one hop you have to do.
Well instant is a ridiculous word, but ~5 seconds.
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:54:01
LMAO you shouldn't trust either, you should verify - but this is something core users are not used to do...
Using his own link you can verify for yourself that I am right, in fact bitcoin core is getting more and more expensive by the minute.
You have to understand, as usage increases, bitcoin core becomes less usable. the irony.
**Bitcoin Core Median Transaction Fee  	0.108 USD**
**Bitcoin Cash Median Transaction Fee	0.0068 USD**
I am giving you the actual links where you can verify what i said - not a link to the homepage like he did, because he doesn't really want you to check.
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:34:57
*Now, we are going to get crickets from the OP*
If you tried to use bitcoin cash.. you would not be wasting your time making this thread.. go give it a shot, be unbiased.. try both - then I assure you'll experience the massive UX positive difference over LN.

no just a guy with commmon sense
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:04:23
finish your thought! come on.. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:01:11
Crickets now microgoatz?
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:26:44
I dare you to try and double-spend. It'll be amusing.
First of all, the only thing you will double spend is your fees, not your balance. IF, you are lucky.
Second of all, you run the risk of both merchant and miner to blacklist you from transactions.
Finally, all it takes is merchant to wait 10-15 seconds until the TX propagates to all nodes to deny you of the service/product, after which he is clear to take the TX as valid.
BONUS: You assume you will be sending your money to the same 5 people all of your life. This is not the case.
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:18:38
LOL? Come on at least be honest...
BCH tx cost is 1/4th of a cent at the moment.
So all in all it would cost around 10 cents actually, not $3.
In BCH it would actually be done faster since you don't need to open channels and all the rest of it..
and, with BTC it's only a matter of time and fees will skyrocket to ridiculous ammounts - while in BCH it will continue to cost that much..
Now that is fair answer.

You realize layer 2 is centralized?
