The words themselves are merely representations of the seed, in a more human usable form. Longer words and shorter words do not matter, as long as the seed was created with sufficient entropy (i.e. not just someone picking their own words "randomly"), because each word is mapped to equal portions of the seed.
A super lazy example, I'm not even sure if the words below are on the list for the BIP:
1 - kitten
2 - purpose
3 - sun
4 - early
5 - watermelon
Above, each word is mapped to an integer, one per word, without regard to word length.

There's no disagreement here that I can tell. I was just playing into your dramatic effect.
Bitcoin is in a funny place. There is some wisdom in avoiding a problem of *"too many cooks spoil the soup"*, but also centralized development runs its own risks, especially given the inherent, anarchic, decentralized nature of cryptocurrency generally.
Jeff Garzik, Peter Todd, Luke-jr, Amir Taaki, Mike Hearn, and even Gavin have each been hated and loathed and not trusted by groups of people. If you have something to do with Bitcoin publicly, some people are going to hate you for it and curse everything you do.
There is a high cost to being a dev in this space.

Bitcoin is supposed to be anarchic (without rulers, not without rules) and thus leaderless, so leadership qualities should take a back seat to technical competency.
I would be comfortable with you creating software for this nascent industry, if you so desire. Your code rises or falls on its own merit.
My original comment was just noting the curiosity in not trusting someone to install an app on a phone when that person helped to write the software upon which the phone depends to run *any* app.

High fees are caused by address reuse or large transaction sizes in general.
I've been moving some coins lately and have been paying 50 satoshis per byte.
For an average transaction (single input, single output), it works out to being about 0.00012 btc or around 30 cents.
Think about paying for a $100 purchase with a single $100 bill. (one input, one output)
Now think about paying for a $100 purchase with handfuls of dimes, dollars, nickels, and pennies. (multiple input, one output)
It takes a cashier more effort to count a bunch pennies than it does to count a single unit of currency. 
So sending multiple transactions to one bitcoin address (address reuse) creates a situation similar to paying for something with a handful of change, which results in more effort for the processor of the transaction, and in the case of bitcoin, more effort (tx size) results in more cost as a miner fee.
A 225 byte transaction is much cheaper than a 5000 byte transaction.
