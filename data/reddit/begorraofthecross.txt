Could you bullet-point a few of the aspects of the society you envision this leading us to?

Dogs and children aren't capable of consent.
I do agree with you on Brave New World, but I think religion and tv are far more used in a mindless hypnotic "brave new world way" in our society; 
and sex is still more of force of freedom in our society overall. Just look how much of a pain in the ass it is for gay people to just have a relationship that is recognized.

Well sex as a liberating force was a powerful theme of Orwell's 1984.
"Sex alienated humanity more than 10000 years of religions combined !"

-Okay.... well anyway.... hope you, learn to try to enjoy your life a little bit and not hate people too thoroughly. Hatred and bitterness and jealousy are genuinely bad and dangerous things, as opposed to sex which is essentially amoral, and can be positive or negative morally. Sex between consenting adults is certainly no worse than wasting time on reddit :-)

You may be severely severely underestimating just how much time and money (and really really good work) has been put into google's search algorithms, and their other related algorithms. There is a reason google search has, for practical discussion, 0 competition. It may seem like, it's a simple thing to do what they do, but with how much money is involved there would be real competition if that were the case.

Or precisely the opposite which strangely is the same idiotic thing "once governments and states disappear capitalism will be free and everyone will be happy"
