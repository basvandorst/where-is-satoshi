Damn... I'd love to help but I've decided to boycott boycotts.

The price will drop until it finds a buyer. Could be $0. Someone else willing to pay for something is what gives anything value

You are not "withdrawing" anything. You are selling it for more than you paid for it so yes, it's taxable

That's not how markets work

Did you at least get the $10 coinbase referral for each of them?
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:55:39
That's not how it works. The money isn't in an "account". You bought a portion of a Bitcoin. When you want to "cash out" you now have to sell that portion of a Bitcoin. Without the buyer you still own your Bitcoin

They act like closing the account is somehow something you should be avoiding

1. If the word "bank" is in their name they're going to predict a crash
2. They were asked to make an "outrageous" prediction. Not sure if you're an American football fan but this is the equivalent of a Sunday morning football pregame show when they're asked to make "bold predictions" about the days games. Then Michael Irvin says something like "Cam Newton will score 12 touchdowns in the first half and save a guy that's choking on popcorn!!!!". They asked for a bold prediction and they got one

The gas station by my house has fuel for $2.35/g. The one by my job sells it for $2.15

Bitcoin isn't rising. Your dollars are crashing. I'd try to get rid of them asap

Your price is locked in at the time of your purchase

I made 4 separate buys yesterday from my BOA account without a problem

Not a tax professional but the $1000 you invest has already been taxed via income tax. That is known as your basis. So in your scenario there would be tax due on the $2000 growth but not before you sell it.

The demand is what directly gives it the value. In your example, if no one wants to buy it at $50k then that's not what it's worth. If one person is willing to pay $49k for it then that's what it's worth. Anything is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it

What would be a good number for you to sell at? Chances are the number that popped into your head was a big round number. For a lot of people $10k is that big round number. No one says, "I'm hodling until it hits $93,437 and then I'm out!".  So a good chunk of people are selling at $10k. The only question is are there enough other people buying at $10k for it to make a difference

Buyers are entering the market faster than Bitcoin is being produced. When you consider the number of people buying Bitcoin as a percentage of people in the world and then compare that to the number of Bitcoins available as a percentage of the maximum number of Bitcoins there will ever be then you start to wrap your mind around it's potential value.
