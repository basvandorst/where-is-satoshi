Now. On Coinbase. Are you saying I can make my bitcoin into lite coin. Then send it to my wallet then turn it back to bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:25:52
Idk. I feel like this is a legit rise. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:14:35
If you only have access to a phone. How would one transfer from say Coinbase or bread on to their ledger or Trevor? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:01:14
Gdaxwon’t let me take a picture with either my phone cam or my Mac cam. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:07:29
Same problem. My computer does the same thing too. I was told to try google chrome. So I’m going to try my dads phone. He has android. Hoping it works 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:01:44
Thank you for the info 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:21:10
Why is it dangerous to keep it in your exchange? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:58:01
Thank you 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:24:36
Omfg. This is hilarious. I’ll hear about this at work tomorrow. Everyone there is a hardcore trump and fox fan. I was just telling them last week about bitcoin. They were like. That’s a scam. Lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:47:32
Bet a better pump. Check your house for pressure reduced valves. Adjust accordingly 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:44:09
Maybe it was newbs selling at the ath. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:39:50
Just buy 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:23:27
Also do you have to pay on any amount?  What if you only profit like a dollar or two. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:02:32
I’ve tried that. It logs me in but I can’t verify with the camera on either my phone or my computer. The camera won’t work 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:48:11
Thank you! Another question. If you don’t mind. I find people’s explanations are easier to understand than what I read when I google it. But. What is a fork?  
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:36:14
Can and should I transfer my bitcoin from my Coinbase to my bread wallet? I don’t plan on selling anytime soon. I want to ride it for as long as I can. I also plan to buy more through Coinbase. Until I make a new bank account to use only for bitcoin for my bread wallet
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:43:56

How old are you?  Or are you an Indian looking for bobs 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:30:09
Thank you again for the link 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:35:27
Try it man. Give it a shot. It’s very good. And good for you 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:50:52
What are some actual exchanges. I have Coinbase. I also have bread for a wallet. Can I buy bitcoin on bread and if so, how is it different from Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:44:11
I would give my family anything they wanted. I’d help them change to be healthier and happier. I’d donate to my local humane society. Id also start building homes for homeless veterans in my state. Then I would donate, protest, and lobby for the federal legalization of marijuana for adult consumption! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:00:55
Thank you bud. How can you find out when their is less congestion 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:56:52
So if I have .7 of bitcoin and a fork happen then I’ll have .7 of bitcoin and .7 of an altcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:22:33
Gotta have some creamer or it tastes like shit. Also add honey for sweetener 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:00:24
Yep. Sorry. .0089
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:20:33
It says deposits and order placements are disabled until I verify my account. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:51:09
How do you place orders?  I’m using Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:23:42
I’m waiting on my ledger to come. I thought I could just transfer my coins over to it. But from what I get from you message I’ll need “apps” like breadwallet to store my btc on my ledger?  I don’t understand could you please explain. Thank you 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:38:38
So. Is bitcoin a forked coin. What happens to my bitcoins after a fork. Do they turn to something else while bitcoin still exists 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:01:44
Ummm. Two eggs and a pice of toast with strawberry jam. Covered the eggs in turmeric, black pepper and cayenne pepper 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:13:18
Can I use gdax without adding my DL or photo. Because on my mobile and my computer when I’m on gdax the camera won’t work to take the picture 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:14:05
Not joking. I try to put turmeric and black pepper on everything. I even put it in my coffee. With the cayenne. Best cup of joe ever. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:03:56
But do you want fork coins. If not how can you avoid fork coins. I don’t understand forks. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:41:06
How do we find out when a fork is coming? How will we know if our online wallet supports it?  Will a ledger or trezor support a fork? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:58:55
What about a wallet. Like bread. I use bread is it “my keys” then 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:28:52
I guarantee it. A freaking alleged sexual assaulter is about to win a campaign in Alabama. Just cause trump said to vote for him. Now. I’m sure he’d probably win anyway if this allegation didn’t come it but I feel that really pulled his card. Then trump was like I endorse him. He’s back up to number one. It’s crazy. If trump talked good about bitcoin. We’d see a huge spike. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:34:31
It would be awesome if CNN would talk bad about bitcoin cause then trump would go insane. FAKE NEWS. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:28:41
When will this fork take place. I can’t find exact dates 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:42:36
What do you mean by proper exchange?  Any advice on one? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:22:56
The spicy taste is what makes it. And the pepper is to help your body absorb the turmeric 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:41:50
How do you send an invite to a friend 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:13:25
Wel how else would you by them with your phone without using USD?  I have a bread wallet but I’ve been using Coinbase to buy. I’m very new and I’m worried linking my bank account to bread. I’m opening a new bank tomorrow to link. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:41:43
Thank you. I’ve found so much good info through Reddit’s users opinion compared to google. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:16:16
I have my gdax account but I can’t verify because the “ take picture of your ID and your face” part isn’t working. On my phone and computer. Nothing shows. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:40:02
Will there be a notice before hand.
@_date: 2019-03-11 01:33:19
No, that happened to me
