An ETF is not an ETN and each has their own risk model. Understand before you invest. $XIV vs $SVXY February 5th is a great example of this. One fund blew up and forced redemption at under 10% value of the previous days close, and the other though it got demolished is still there at a little over %12 of it's close on the day. If you hold long enough you could still catch a profit, the other one is gone with the wind and all you get is a capital loss.

ETF is backed by assets, ETN is a note which has a calculated value at issuance,  and in intervals is recalculated as the value the underwriters would redeem those shares for. An ETN can be purely a mathematical insturment who's value is derived from another insturment. Aka a gold etf would be a note saying you can come and retrieve 1 unit gold for one share... because there is gold to go pick up. A gold ETN would say that you can redeem your share for the dollar value of 1 unit gold at bank of gold. They dont have to have any gold to issue the ETN. In the case of the ETF if it was dissolved you would be getting your share of gold from the vault. If the ETN underwriter was insolvent and dissolved the ETN, then there is no gold becuase it was not backed by assets, and the underwriter doesnt have the cash to redeem shares... so the ETN is worthless. A positive for ETNs is that fees can be lower because there are no custodial charges since there is nothing to mannage, and since they are mathematically calculated they can track their underlying asset better than an ETF would.

They are allowed to, but not required, that fact would be in the prospectus.

Im going to throw this out there, banks won't cease to exist because of a lack of money in the future. The money the banks hold won't be worth even the cost of storage. Thus banks will cease to exist. 
So even if we all use BTC in the future as our main form of money. Unless deliberately destroyed every dollar that has existed will still exist.

In his own head which is just one perspective he can believe there is no threat to bitcoin. He is just justifying his own investments then trying to convince the viewer that he honest and unbiased. The reality is that one person can not conceive all the possible angles of attack there could be. I do think bitcoin secure to timely attacks and am invested in it proportionally so. With that said even just last week with the ASICBleed attack. We came to realize Jihan Wu could likely wipe out 70% of the total hashing power and seize 51% with his own farm. With every attack bitcoin will get stronger because it's developers and users are more aware of the methods of attack. This though doesn't mean something unforeseen couldn't become a threat.
