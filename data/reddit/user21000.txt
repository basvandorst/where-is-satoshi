It's been discussed numerous times in these threads.  There is a simple trade off between space and time.  Current architecture is a giant lookup table of past transactions.  This trades space for table creation simplicity (I.e. time).  A PoW function that uses mining power (compute time) to calculate a space-saving hash that gives a probabilistically suitable answer to determine UTXO validity would suffice.
All of bitcoin is based on clever probabilistic decisions except the UTXO table.  Time to move in that direction.

Article botched the facts about the Winklevoss twins.
Supposedly they bought 1% at about $6-8, or some ridiculously low price.  1% at 10M bitcoins (at the time) matches well with the address with 111,111 bitcoins in it.
111,111 x $10 is about $1M.  
So they didn't "pour $11M into" bitcoin.  It just rose in value.

You're looking at this all wrong!
Sure it can be done.  It can be done by one agency that exists today.  It's called the Fed.  If they picked an exchange rate, and printed or retired dollars to keep the exchange rate stable, then it would be done.
Tying the bitcoin to the dollar is the same as tying the dollar to the bitcoin, and that can only be done on the one end.
What Max Kaiser is advocating (although he probably doesn't realize it) is going back to the days of the dollar being backed by something which has a fixed supply (like gold backing).

A transaction can be created and signed with her private key (and others), grabbing money from multiple inputs and paying out to multiple outputs.

There is also a game going on as to whether the spread will get bigger or smaller.
If you are sitting there with fiat on Gox, you can buy Bitcoins now at a premium.  Or you can bet that it'll be a smaller premium later...
I think the premium will get bigger (this process may already be happening), and this could very well cause a "run" on Gox, with the price getting higher and higher, and the spread getting bigger and bigger.

I gave a one hour talk to  business people yesterday, and started out with "never before in the history of mankind has it been possible to transfer value directly to any other person in the world almost instantly and almost free", and proceeded to explain why credit cards, checks, cash, gold, and PayPal all failed to meet that statement.
Then I held up a letter and an envelope and said, "if this was 1970, and I was telling you that you could transport THIS letter to anyone in the world nearly instantly and nearly free, you would be thinking transporting atoms, like on Star Trek.  But instead, what we did was convert the letter to 'information' which can be sent over a wire, and today we have email, which everyone takes for granted."
"Bitcoin (or some virtual currency) will do to money what email did to letters".
That sets the stage for why this is important.  It also sets the stage for people to quit thinking about the tangible (letters, coins and paper bills) and start thinking in terms of information (letter contents, account balances, a ledger, the block chain).
Then I explained how bitcoin is less like coins and more like a p2p shared ledger (every time I read "what is a bitcoin? A bitcoin is a string of numbers" I shout "NO NO NO!  it's a shared ledger!!!!")
Then explain the two major breakthroughs of the bitcoin design... 
By sharing the ledger, you can generally tell if someone HAD the money that they are trying to spend.  But that doesn't fix the double-spend challenge.
Transactions arrive at different times to different people in a p2p network... how do you sequence transactions?  By "locking them in".  How do you lock them in?  By doing work to them, that someone else would need to duplicate  in order to resequence them.
How do you motivate people to do a bunch of work?  By paying them in the very currency that they are performing the bookkeeping work on.
AND ... how do you initially distribute the currency in a fair manner?  By paying the workers.
Hope that helps.

I like the analogy of transactions being checks coming into a clearing house, and the hashing function being a giant paperweight to hold groups of checks in place in order.  It takes physical work to put a 100 lb paperweight into place.

The sending of change to another address is a behind-the-scenes operation of almost every client that you would normally be oblivious to.
Why do you believe that your client works differently?  What client do you use?  Most people's client holds multiple bitcoin addresses, so when you send money, this occurs, but you wouldn't even know or care.  The only way you'd notice is if you examined the transaction or the address balance using blockchain.info or something.
The only time you'd really care about this behavior is when your wallet file gets deleted.
The reason for this behavior is because when you spend money, the public key for the address is recorded in the transaction, and so there's a security concern that someday this will be hackable.  Also, a fresh "change" address adds to anonymity.

I think they incorrectly use the term "verified" instead of "confirmed".
Anyone can verify the validity of a transaction - that the sender has the private key, the recipient's address, and the amount.  Confirmation is used to confirm that the funds are there to be spent, and require the processing of the miners.

since they are subdividable, it doesn't matter which one you go with from the perspective of how much you are investing. You want to go with the one that has the highest probability of success. And asking that question in a bit clean for him, well, you going to get the answer Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-30 07:50:02
Close, but still not accurate.
Both sides of the transaction pay fees, but the bitcoin side is paid in bitcoin.  Mt. gox can pay their employees in bitcoin, but otherwise can't do much with it, without converting it to fiat. And they claim that they never trade on their exchange, so they'd have to take it elsewhere.

There are a ton of data points, but no link to future price.  If you took all that data, along with price history (offset by 30 days, perhaps) and ran some stats analysis, you could see which data points had positive correlation.

So, do you think it is meaningful to say that the bitcoin network is ten times as powerful as the ten largest supercomputers combined, or is that comparing apples to oranges because of the specialization?
Seems a lot like saying that a toy remote control car is more powerful than the supercomputers because it can carry a small load further.

Not only is it based on an average over lots of blocks, but it also only partially corrects to the average, smoothing out any oscillation.  This has the effect of having the adjustments lag the actual average, which is why blocks are getting solved faster and faster.  It's no longer ten minutes - its averaging around 8 minutes now, and dropping.

There are only a few reasons why someone would pay a 10% premium at Gox over their competition.  One is ignorance.  Another is "trusting the largest exchange".  Another is that they can't get dollars out.

He just picked an arbitrary number - $25 - with no justification whatsoever.  A valid rebuttal to such a proposition would be to say "I'm more comfortable at $2500.". Both are equally stupid.
There is one thing you can look at: the total world wealth that is stored in bitcoins, and try to figure out if it's a lot or a little, relative to the current state of the asset.  He is more comfortable at 300M ($25 x 12M).
Go try to find a company that has business in 150 countries and has the media attention of bitcoin and the growth of interest that is only worth $300M.  Or ANY asset for that matter.

Doesn't the video say it's 60 characters?  I tried pasting the same phrase twice, and it comes up looking like the video, and that's more than 9 characters.  
"mark zukerberg is a slimy mark zukerberg is a slimy" is not the correct answer.  
Also, 10% of 111,111.111 would be 11,111.1111, which would take the rich guy down to pretty close to an even 100,000.  I'm predicting that the rich guy made the video, and will "pay himself" 10%, and look like a hero.
Either that, or someone is trying to crash the market.  Or is SUCH a saint that they don't want to steal $10M, and are counting on a huge reward.  Or, the obvious:  It's fake.

Since that address has been used before, it was either by him (meaning that a virus long ago could have burned him) or it's a passphrase-protected wallet with a shitty passphrase.
Hackers have giant lists of vulnerable addresses, and this was probably on it.  They watch the block chain, and when a vulnerable address appears as an output, they sweep it.

I Love this comment, taken from the 2nd link, above..
Wealth is now force proof
For the first time in the history of mankind, force can’t be used to take wealth. How is that not the single most important evolution in all history?
Even if some people know you have 10 000 BTC, they can’t do anything about it. Sure they can torture you, but unless you give in, they have no way of getting to your wealth. Imagine that a government decides to take money directly from its citizens bank account (that would never happen, of course…). With Bitcoin, for the first time ever, they can’t.
You can transfer your bitcoins to anyone, anywhere in the world, without any 3rd party being able to stop or steal from you. Your wealth is now in your control.

Nice attempt, but the obvious flaw is this:  if no one spent any bitcoins for an hour, the blockchain would get bigger, and therefore heavier, and so your bitcoins would be worth less per gram.  If at the same time, the price per bitcoin goes up, then they are worth more per gram.
@_date: 2013-06-18 09:09:58
The reason is because it's a log of all transactions... a list of "checks" signed over from one person to another.  If you want to validate checks that are signed over from one person to another, you need to have the history of that check.

But you listed a bitcoin address in your example, not a public key.
Here's my understanding:    
There are three significant numbers.....    
Private key. -&gt;  public key  -&gt; bitcoin address
You can easily derive these from left to right.  That is, if you know the left number, you can derive the one to its right.  Further, the public key can be used to prove that you are in possession of the private key (but the bitcoin address cannot).
You gave me a bitcoin address.  If I pay it, then a transaction records that, and it only contains the bitcoin address... not your public key, on the output side.  
If you then spend the money, the transaction contains that bitcoin address as the sender ("input"), and the public key for verification.  Then it signs the transaction with the private key.
In other words, the bitcoin address is **not** the public key.  And no one knows the public key of the address you listed except you, if you've never spent from it. 
And the term wallet refers to a collection (1 or more) of these triplets.
So using a new wallet isn't as important as using a new bitcoin address.... unless you are saying that you use a new wallet just to minimize the intermixing possibilities which taints.  (I do that a lot too, on block chain.info.  not on bitcoin-qt.  A bunch of new wallet files on qt would be cumbersome.)
