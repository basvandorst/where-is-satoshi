Yes exactly. There is actually a standard protocol called BIP that a lot of the "good" hardware wallets use nowadays. So if you lose/break/brick your hardware wallet, as long as it was a BIP based wallet, you can use any other BIP based wallet to recover your funds. Could be a different company, different brand, etc, but if the protocols match up, they are running the same magic that generates the same keys. 
Also, I wouldn't say hardware wallets will be particularly hard to acquire. I haven't looked into it, but im pretty sure you can make your own wallet if you wanted. I bought two wallets because by the time i finished going to amazon and picking them out, i had already made the money back in btc. :)

You mean like gold?

There's more!
First of all, there's a PIN required to unlock the device, just like your iPhone. Let's assume they have your PIN somehow...
2048! (Factorial) is a really really really really really really big number. The thieves are better off playing the PowerBall. But let's say they somehow know your 24 words and the order...
When setting up your device, you have the option to enter a 25th word to generate your root key. This 25th word doesn't have to be from the 2048 word pool that the first 24 words are from.
So your thief will need the following: your PIN, your 24 words in the correct order, your 25th word. Can it happen? Sure. Just like I can go to gmail.com and type in a random persons email address and a random password and it will successfully log me in. 
There's still one more attack vector we haven't discussed... What if some thief ties you up, puts a gun to your head, puts your device in front of you and demands you unlock it and empty your funds.
Well, remember the 25th seed word? Turns out these devices can hold multiple rootkeys. Which means they can generate multiple different wallet signatures. Which means...what? 
It means you should have two 25th words. One of those words, when combined with your 24 words and PIN will generate keys that access your full wallet and wealth. The other 25th word (the one you will tell the guy who has a gun to your head) will be combined with the same 24 words and same PIN but will unlock a wallet that you only put a small amount of coins in. You can tell the thief you're broke and that's all you have. Once he lets you go, you buy a new device, put in the PIN and 24 words, along with the 25th word tied to your full wealth, and bam you got your money back (minus the stuff you had in your decoy wallet). 
Also keep in mind the firmware could have been tampered with at any time during the production of the device until it reaches your hands. Possible? Yes. Likely? Not really. If someone wants your coins, they will have to work really hard to get it. It might make more sense for them to invest that effort in a high value target...like nicehash.
Hope this made sense. I tried to ELI5.

I don't know the probabilities off the top of my head but 12 words in the correct order is also a very high amount of entropy. 24 is a lot more.

Why do you want to know? So you can steal my seed?? 
Just kidding. Most people will put a copy in a safe and give copies to other people they highly trust.

Your 24 words are used to generate what's known as a root key. The same 24 word input in the correct order will generate the same root key everytime. 
Don't worry about someone guessing your 24 words. There's a  2048! (that's factorial) word pool that your 24 words come from. Even if a thief knows your 24 words but doesn't know the order, it will take centuries to guess the right order. 
Anyway, like I said, the 24 words generate the same root key everytime, which in turn generates the same wallet signatures every time. And once the signatures are generated, the coins associated with those signatures are within your control again.

Honestly its is a lot of fun participating in something like this, not just irl friends but internet friends too
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:42:37
True. If you don't use a 25th word your 25th word is a blank. So there is always a 25th word.

Not heaps, but yes it can get a bit expensive. Good thing Bitcoin rises thousands of dollars a day sometimes to offset those fees.

It gets delivered on a truck. They don't have someone drive it to your house.
