Having a mortgage on your house is a good way to end up homeless? Most people take out a mortgage to buy their house in the first place. Obviously putting it all in bitcoin is a bad idea, but investing in mutual funds and bonds as well as bitcoin in part if you have confidence in it is a smart choice.
I didn't reply to your comment regarding rent, I replied to the parent comment regarding loans.

Mortgages tend to have very low interest rates, it can be sensible to take out a mortgage to invest, and if you are optimistic about BTC maybe invest partially in it as well.

Yeah not only is it irrelevant in comparison to government, but what is the unit. How much currency is bitcoin mining producing vs money printing?

Ah I'm sure those stuck in North Korea feel stupid about their choice to live there instead of just being born in the U.S. like some other people.

Why? Unless it is screwing over their investors somehow it's no greater a crime than when an individual or small private business launders money...

I wouldn't call it theft because a thief usually doesn't leave something behind but it is definitely involuntary seizure of property. 
To maintain any state at all you need a passable military or a third party supporting your country with passable military, otherwise you will just be invaded and subject to whatever tax scheme exists by the state which annexes yours. 
Then there are flat taxes which comes from people selling stupid shit as something everyone should be forced to buy instead of making the individual choice to support.
And finally there are progressive taxes which are wealth distribution and include things like healthcare, education, or social services (even social services for military personnel, like G.I. bill, that would otherwise fall into the military category.)
However you could argue some things in the flat tax and progressive tax category might actually be necessary to sustain a country, at least in the long run. Particularly education, possibly certain subsidies like say farming, and arguably infrastructure spending.

You invest in the asset because you expect the value of it to rise. If the value is rising, it means each month you buy less of it for the same amount of cash. 
Your 100 might buy you 100 zcoin, and over the course of the month it doubles in value. Your next investment only secures 50 more zcoin, and your 200 has only bought you 150 zcoin.
OTOH if you buy 200 right away, by next month when it doubles in value you still have 200 zcoin. 
IRL this is much less exaggerated (you probably don't expect BTC to double in a month) but the only time helps you is if you happen to start investing before a dip. If the coin is losing value more often than it is gaining value, you will come ahead from DCA because you mitigated your losses, but you are losing money. OTOH if there is more growth than dips (the value goes up over time) then it is more likely a random investment time is not right before a dip. 
You can use this [calculator]( to try out it for S+P 500. If you expect growth from BTC it will work the same way.

Just a heads up, DCA is when you have a lump sum available but choose to invest it in portions over time. For example if you had 24k in savings and invested 2k a month from it you are DCA. OTOH spending a portion of your paycheck is just plain investing. 
Also if you do have the opportunity to DCA, I recommend not doing it. It only saves you if you begin before a major slump or crash, which is pretty dumb luck if you can't tell the future (and if you can you'd be rich already.) From historical data it is the better choice to invest the lump sum right away the majority of the time.

If you think he's using decentrilization wrong you either don't agree or didn't get the OP.

When you put in a portion of your paycheck there is not an oppurtunity cost. You aren't losing potential money from hesitating to buy the assets. When you have 1000 dollars expendable but only invest 100 at a time you are making less (generally) than the more conventional strategy of investing 1000 right away. OTOH if you have 100 dollars, invest it right away, you are following a more conventional strategy. And after expenses next month when you have 100 more expendable and invest it right away, you are following the conventional strategy again. You are not losing out compared to investing 200 the first month because you didn't have 200 available the first month.

A world where the word doesn't actually sound like weeaboo? Also a world where Asia is a big subcontinent and two languages sharing similar words isn't a very appalling coincidence?
