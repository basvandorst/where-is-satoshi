RemindMe! 30 days "What happened to the drive with all the BTC"

Get a professional data recovery company to recover it. Get a quote from them. Ask if you can pay only if the data has been recovered. If they agree, get a loan. Pay for recovery. Then exchange for USD and then pay off the loan.

How do you avoid getting raped by the taxman? I read another comment about only taking out 38k a year. What other methods are there. Legal ones that is.

Can someone clarify.
If you've got 1 BTC. Ill get 0.55 BTC and also 0.45 BTCT. 
I can either sell the BTCT straight away, or wait and exchange them for 0.45 BTC at a later date.
These BTCT will also have an exchange rate too right? And thus volatility ? So I might get fucked over if I exchange them at the wrong time. And surely with everyone selling the price will plummet. I feel like I'm missing the point here. BTCT will be worthless?

Google it but yeh, seized. They are hoping to come back up, and claim to be able to refund you 55% of your funds straight away, and the other 45% will be given in BTC-E Tokens which you can use on the exchange too, and exchange them for other cryptos. But the BTC-E tokens sounds like they wont be available for a while. Perhaps even 2 years. Acces to the 55% is supposedly sometime in September. They will come back up with Know your customer verification to comply with anti money laundering laws. So expect to have to send them ID etc. I'd also expect balance limit levels of ID, like other exhanges, so the more money you have, the more verification and identity you have to provide. I expect this will take weeks/months for them to verify everyone.
I'm no expert, that's just what I've read from the long update threads on bitcointalk and using google translate.

Is there not some sort of anon or decentralized exchange that could have used to convert? Then just send it through a few monero transactions? Did these hackers fuck up, if so how?
I imagine that in the future we will see cryptolockers using monero ransoms directly to save them hassle.
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:31:08
Gotcha. Problem is they need to give some sort of date we can expect to be able to trade them for their full value. Otherwise everyone sells because they get impatient. 
 (Which is good for the exchange if they can sell them for lower than their value, means less BTC coming out of their pockets)

They will think its a scam and say no because they think they know best.

I honestly don't buy it. I've seen the post he supposedly made with his personal email but I really can't believe that someone as technically minded as him would slip up like that.
My theory is that one of the 3 letter agencies used a zero day hack or something without a warrant to do so and knew they couldn't use that as evidence, so they just planted his email and framed him, perhaps even from his own computer. 
Obviously this is all my personal speculation. I just find it hard to believe he would make such a rookie mistake after years of successfully running a highly illegal website.

I'm just speculating but could it be the world police ordering bitrex to hold you funds etc. Maybe you are under investigation?
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:23:06
Absolutely get it off an exchange. Like other have said. Do it with a very small amount and make sure you know how to open your own wallet using your private key or keystrore file etc. A few times. Then send the rest once you are confident.
If the coins are on the exchange they are not your coins. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:01:46
If they are on an exchange they are not your coins. Get them off asap.

Most likely, as in the report/lawsuit whatever its called, by the world police, one of the other reasons was the fact that BTC-E had no KYC or anti money laundering procedure. I think I even read a post by BTC-e on bitcointalk saying they will have KYC.

What are people using for escrow ?
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:45:27
Noob question: What happens (to the fed, economy, in general) if it doesn't stabilize itself after a while?
Also at what point does the fed realize its been injecting too long and wants to pull out, when does it stop, when is too much too much?
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:08:46
I know what escrow is, just not who or what service they are using.
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:38:25
In the off chance the do come back up, I'm pretty sure they will only be allowed to operate with some sort of verification for KYC, as that seems to be a big point that the US didn't like about their operation from the reports I read.

I'm still not getting my hopes up. But good on BTC-e if they do.
But how do they play on refunding the coins if the 'purses / wallets' have been seized. Am I missing something. Unless they have various other wallets, which I hope, as backups, that they will use.
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:04:05
Use chrome / google to translate.
I really hope we can get our coins back. But I doubt it. I think if I don't get them back, I am done with crypto. I was just about to move my coins off there too before it happened. Fuck.
