How long before IO error chance ramps up? I've got it running with the 1024 swap for 6 hours, all up to date:

I did something stupid and sshd doesn't run automatically on reboot now. Need to take it into work bc I have no hdmi display here. 
I think it's going to work with a 1024mb swap file. 512mb wasn't enough.

I'm going to allocate a bigger swap and try again.
There's probably a better way but here's a basic overview:
* The rpi is running ArchLinux which was installed from the old img that the Arch people stopped issuing. 
* Installed image with ApplePi-baker
* To see bitcoin packages available: pacman -sS bitcoin. To install: pacman -S &lt;name&gt;
* Resize partition: 
* Swap file creation:
