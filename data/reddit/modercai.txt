@_date: 2018-01-10 10:26:54
Can you people stop calling it correction? 
it went up to 20k and droped to 13k, ok thats correction, but when it is going 17k -&gt; 13k -&gt; 17k -&gt; 14k that is not a fucking correction that is just oscilation and market movement.
A lot of people use term correction for every time fucking red candles appear.
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:53:57
what happens if you extend the metal part so its - -, does the price plummet?
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:13:34
No refunds are available if you payed via Friends &amp; Family, i personaly spoken over the phone with PayPal Customer service regarding this issue.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:29:14
how exactly does one do that?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:07:57
Science can sustain same with bitcoin price being 2000 or 15000. There really isnt any need for bitcoin to be that expensive. I bought in at 9700 with loan money so believe me im not here to spread FUD or something like that.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:21:15
I sent payment and got scammed and i coudlnt get money back.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:07:33
Its instant.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:03:33
No the money doesnt belong to me, someones lifesavings could be in this and someones life could be ruined, i want to return it to its rightfull owner
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:00:35
Ive been following BTC when it was around 4500, but im more into details now then i was before purchase.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:51:36
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:06:16
When it was at 9000 :) sorry for missunderstanding.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:26:08
I have 95% investment in BTC so dont get me wrong and its on Nano Ledger S so i intend to HODL it but what makes you all so positive that it will skyrocket again? What are those asumptions made on? This isnt FUD id just like some calming to my mind and some info to get me easier trough this.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:07:24
Move it to another wallet she doesnt know about.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:13:27
Its 4 in the morning i just took a piss and checked prices + reddit... going back to sleeo again :D
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:29:18
In other words if BTC hits $300 000 value haha
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:50:02
Hypothetical question. You get yourself in situation you invested $20000 on Coinbase in that period the IRS is snooping. You have a lot of BTC and wanna cash out without poping alarms all over IRS. You take one of your trusty friends that isnt on IRS radar, take a trip with him to cayman islands, switzerland or monte carlo or where ever is tax paradise. 
1.He opens up BTC wallet on some non-US company(bitstamp for example)
2.You transfer BTC to his wallet.
3. He opens bank account in cayman island/monte carlo/switzerland
4. He pays out from his wallet to new bank account
5. He walks into a bank and cashes out for you.
After that you can open bank account there also and put it up there where US goverment cant touch it.
Am i having too much imagination or is this viable?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:03:02
Not soon. It will take months for it to be public. Mark my words. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:11:50
very close but it will still be some time till lightning is implemented to public.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:33:01
Ill sell at 200k :D
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:37:56
i noticed it when it was just 1000, seemed unusal to me. made a post to it on bitcoinmarkets
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:19:34
Woah... no wonder we are climbing so fast.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:22:01
Yes that is correct. Dont need to wait anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:40:47

@_date: 2017-12-03 16:56:41
I have bought 0.212 BTC at around $9000... just out of curiosity... i dont think thats much but how do people percieve those numbers? Is it lol pocketchange, is it okay, is it average... how would you rate it?
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:34:09
Show screenshots of how you have your charts or anything to check prices of cryptos set up on your phones!
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:56:36
I took a bank loan for 4 years and went all in when price was at 9700. I was never so 100% determined about anything like i was in BTC, i still am but i bet you can understand from my position why am i shitting my pants atm.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:11:31
This is the main reason among others i invested in it, it.
 is because of this im confident that it will succeed and i think that it is still at its early early stage and its still not late to chip in.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:04:32
It means chinese would lose a LOT of money in that time.
Dont think it would affect the price a lot.
Then again i might be all wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:07:52
How do i do that? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:22:08
Did you hear of lightning technology that will make it virtualy instant?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:13:07
Im new in this i bought in recently dont have that much of a knowledge how it works.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:39:11

You do realise that world consists of more than just America?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:18:04
If it was 7.6xxxxBTC fill in the numbers for me so i know it is really you and i will send them back to you because i got this into my wallet today and i sure didnt buy them.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:45:55
I have application that collects prices from few different exchanges and projects average price.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:43:47
Haha mine to but there is this pile of paper growing faster than Bitcoin and there aint gonna be correction anytime soon
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:52:47
If i could get money back i put in roulette i could probably buy 1BTC now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:45:34
i bet you said few days ago exactly the same thing but you said 10k instead of 20k.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:29:08
Im somewhat $400 in profit from start.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:22:49
Its not smart, thats correct. But it could be right move :D as long as it doesnt plumet under 10k
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:04:42
Exactly what i will do, just HODL, a lot less stressful. Learned my lesson lost 0.05 BTC due 'playing games'
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:25:36
Each day im more confident that this will rise more than we think.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:58:27
Im talkin when you want to cash out milions not 50k dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:30:00
Leave this group then. Bye.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:56:12
Haha fair enough but i still do what im payed for, just slower than usualy.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:36:19
go away.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:22:11
Hope ill have to read this one day.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:52:29
It never hit 20k
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:55:45
remember when bitcoin was 12k ? Yeah i remember those 5 hours
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:17:30
i have few noob questions that come to my mind when reading some of the comments:
1. If LN will be implemented it will be implemented or provided by some big ass company and by that wont it cancle whole point of Bitcoin by no more being decentralized.
2. I read people mentioning that you can benefit the Bitcoin, if you can benefit the code and post it as a suggestion and than if community decides that it is better THEY implement it into bitcoin, but who is THEY that would do that?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:42:25
Yeah good point, makse sense. But was just hypothetical question.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:20:33
Im so glad i moved my bitcoin to nano ledger wallet... coudlnt care more about ups and downs, really it eases ones mind... its gonna be what its gonna be. No more "ahh i could have sold now and bought at the dip" 
Since i moved it i check price a lot less daily than i did before when i had it on exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:44:13
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:54:51
There will be no nuclear war.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:22:05
I did to point where i thought is enough to buy.
After purchase i went more in depth.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:23:00
I read article where they interviewd them and they said they are not gonna rush it until they have it perfect 100%, too much money involved to rush something like that and end up risking btcs getting lost or on wrong adresses. Could cause massive damage.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:08:26
i took a 4 year bank loan and went all in at $9700/BTC.
Yes im shitting my pants every time it starts to drop but im HODLING.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:46:44
Thats exactly how much im in right now.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:43:14
Im checking prices in middle of night when i wake up.
Last 2 dips specialy the one from 11450 to 8900.. i said to myself at 11390 i should sell immediately its gonna crash any second now the rise is to fast... but i didnt have balls to do it :/ 
At this point im just gonna HODL,  dont have much tho anyway just 0.213BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:14:29
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:16:11
What does this mean?
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:14:35
Actually i took a fucking loan from bank and put the cash into BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:37:46
We saw a huge sell of 16milion dollars worth of bitcoins from some whale and the price plumeted.... if he bought back for 16 mil... price would go up, he could sell then again and again make profit.
Did i get this right is this possible? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:27:56
The moment i would be able to buy apartment id cash it all out.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:21:15
Its gonna be -50% soon, when does it stop being correction and infact is something other than just a "correction" ?
im not spreding FUD im just curious.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:19:28
80$ each month for 4 years. I can afford that.
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:44:12
I ordered one from ebay for $2 and when it gets here im gonna sell it localy for few thousands and say its Bitcoin, half people think its really a COIN! haha
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:08:21
not yet.
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:01:37
i dont think anyone can predict any price at this point...god knows who might drop in hundreds of millions into the bitcoin/crypto etc...and what might it do to price/market, or some other negative things that can affect the bitcoin/price in some negative way.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:00:57
No, i have firm paycheck. Il do everything like before ill just have to stay few hours after work to catch up before deadlines.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:34:56
Been walking in mall last 20 mins and refreshing the BTC chart apps like maniac and i come across this...lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:33:07
Took the loan in.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:02:31
its important that its decentralized and noone can influence it :D 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:53:41
someone pressed the NITRO button?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:02:50
I took a gamble...should have cashed at 19k haha
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:43:04
Yes we have segwit and lightning but i dont thinknit will do anything to price.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:38:22
I can hodl for exactly 2 weeks. Than i have to cash out be it 100k bitcoin or 10 dollars.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:26:30
it offers droping from 8.7k to 5k?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:04:18
Dip my ass... dipping the sauce till there is no more to dip...than what?
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:00:09
prepare 9k memes!
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:31:57
Thing is with bitcoin and crypto... the technology can work be it price $10k or $1 per bitcoin...
technology will survive and be used widely at one point but problem is what will happen to price and to peoples money that invested in it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:46:08
Yes. Realestate. House. Apartment. It can and will make income as long as there are people on earth.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:01:30
Exactly my point, its hard to pick up the sarcasm on internet, hence that smiley at the end.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:33:49
99% of positive and good news had close to 0 impact to bitcoins price while all of the bad news drives the price down.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:31:55
we wasted that "card" good news, talking about it, big companies backing it up.... what will we use to get the price back up? dont have much really...
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:38:09
Its gamble pure gamble. Noone knows it yet everyone is acting smart and saying this is good price to buy etc....
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:27:07
according to current price, it isnt.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:16:16
let me ask you something is it better to sell at lower loss or at higher loss?
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:19:08
Dip is only if it goes back up and how it looks like atm its not. So this is massive decline.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:11:01
why dont you sell all now and buy at 6500 ?
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:54:42
Everyone saying oh nice its up on sale, yet none of them are buying. They are just lying to themselves.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:30:13
I bought in at 9500..... should i sell now to minimize loss or wait? I dont have much time will have to cash out in 2 weeks regardless.....have to pay money back.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:37:15
Will this shit stop going down??
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:53:56
it went up 600$ in 5 seconds.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:02:08
man if you checked 5 minutes earlier you would be in bigger shock.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:30:36
technicaly it would drive the price up! less of if in circulation
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:17:55
who gives a fuck, all of this shit just drive price down and those positive news mean jack shit and have no effect on price.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:03:00
No i just want it go to back again to 11k 12k so i can cash out.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:42:07
all on asumption that it will go UP again.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:19:19
I will, just waiting a bit more for it to come up because i need money atm otherwise i woudmnt have problems waiting more.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:18:54
if i was in america i woudlnt need to do any of this shit anyway... could easily earn money trough work and get payed decently
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:36:58
Will this shit stop going down??
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:43:38
Everyone saying HODL while they have 100$ invested, this HODL thing is getting out of hand.
Really dont think this will ever go over 15k again.
Dont get me wrong i have 95% of portfolio invested in BTC and i want it to go up but i dont see that happening any time soon atleast.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:39:11
It pisses me off that it started this bad downars..2 weeks before cashout
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:43:03
funny how they call it decentralized when whales can obviously manipulate with the "price"
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:13:59
This hodling shit is getting out of hand, its just comfort for people deep in.
What would be better than hodl? Selling it at 18k marker when it was there.
