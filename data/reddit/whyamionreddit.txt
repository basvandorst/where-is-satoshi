Bitcoin's (and most cryptocurrencies) transactions get mined into a blocks that get added to the blockchain. Transactions pay fees so that miners will mine them into a block. Bitcoin has a 1mb blocksize limit which is not enough for the volume of transactions being made. As such, because everyone wants their transaction mined, people pay high fees (often exceeding $20 per transaction) so that miners will mine their transaction into the limited block space instead of others. There's two competing visions for the future of Bitcoin, and a while back they've actually forked the blockchain. The BTC chain follows the vision that Bitcoin should be a "store of value", wait for a possible LN network while keeping the blocksize at 1mb in anticipation of a future level 2 scaling mechanism and as the person above mentioned, actually use altcoins such as LTC to transact instead of BTC. The BCH (Bitcoin Cash) chain follows the vision that the blocksize be increased now (Aug 1, 2017 to be exact) to allow for on chain transactions that currently work with less than 1 cent fees, and they believe that Bitcoin should be a currency with utility first, and a store of value at the same time.

Can you PM me some more details, maybe your source? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:02:26
Yes, 21 million bitcoins. When all of them are mined, the only income miners will get is from fees. It's in the pretty distant future though. I think I've 122 years from now is when.

A wallet. CoPay is a wallet, but there's a lot around. Electrum is pretty nice too. But the way Bitcoin (and most cryptocurrencies) work, is there's a private key for every public address. The public address is what you give to people, and they can send money to it, and it's what they see when you send money to them. The private key is what you keep secret, and it's what lets you send the transactions from your address. So basically the private key controls your money. Services like coinbase control that for you, but if they get hacked your money is gone, look up what happened with mt.gox. I know Coinbase has an advanced option where you can create a vault and you get the private keys, but I recommend just using your own wallet.

Whether you support Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash, for things like VPNs, a privacy coin like Monero is probably better suited for the job
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:49:25
You should never hold your crypto on an exchange, control the private keys yourself. Will we ever learn from mt.gox and the countless exchange hackings after it? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:53:30
But wait, way back before the BCH fork, weren't we told that pretty much all the major businesses and wallets had adopted segwit support? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:57:35
LTC will hit the same hard blocksize limit eventually too. And if LN turns out to ever release and have its merits, but needs segwit, BCH could hard fork segwit or another malleability fix instead of dealing with the mess mentioned above 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:56:17
Still though, I think Electrum's GUI is much more intuitive and useful than the main client's GUI. I wonder if anyone has ever tried to package Electrum as a full node... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:46:29
Non mining nodes don't do anything, which is why the whole UASF thing was never going to work
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:55:34
Just because the block limit is at 8mb does not mean every block is 8mb, it varies depending on network load. In fact, there have only been a few blocks in the history of BCH that have even gone close to that high, and most blocks right now are just barely above 1mb. So I'm not sure what you're trying to say. Spam transactions certainly haven't been much of a problem, and Bitcoin Cash still has a block size limit, it's 8mb for now, so it's not like a malicious miner could mine a 1tb block right now to spam the network. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:31:30
talking about people calling a crypto currency by it's wrong name the irony lol
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:00:27
Why limit the base chain in hopes of LN? That's what I don't get, intentionally limiting the transaction capacity of Bitcoin in hopes of a future LN instead of lettings the base chain scale and developing LN at the same time. If LN ever comes out and it turns out to be all that is hoped for, it's trivial to soft fork BCH for segwit, because it's just merging in the same commits. Or better yet, hard fork and get rid of the mess OP mentioned. So why not have the larger blocksize chain now, and also be able to easily integrate LN when it comes out? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:04:05
The alts with the brightest future imo are ETH, XMR, and BCH. XRP might increase in price, but it's not a real cryptocurrency that will ever be used for general transactions 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:48:00
I think the argument is the price increase before the announcement, people are thinking that some people knew ahead of time about the announcement and were able to profit

Regardless of if you support emergent consensus, segwit, or whatever, this is not good. We need more independent (and not just forked, completely different) implementations of Bitcoin in order to prevent network attacks and centralization, as well as make Bitcoin easier to interface with.
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:04:58
Um, no, there is one Bitcoin protocol, there are multiple Bitcoin clients. btcd is an example of another full node implementation, written in Go. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:30:51
I was never talking about BU, or Classic, or XT. I was talking about how over 93% of that graph was one implementation, which makes the network much more vulnerable. It's even more than 93% if you count the forks of Core, such as BU, Classic, XT, knots, etc because they share enough code that it is very likely that a problem with Core would appear in those too. We need more implementations, with more people running those. A ground up C++ client that fully takes advantage of new C++11, C++14 features would be cool too, because my understanding is that although Core might have better code quality than BU, there's still much to be desired. Now I'm not saying that core should be discontinued, but it should be developed alongside other implementations, and we shouldn't really have one dominant client, at least not of the level we have right now. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:05:21
This is going to be a really unpopular opinion, but IMO this is why we need companies like coinbase as a 2nd layer wallet of sorts. Bitcoin itself can replace banks, but coinbase and others will have to be the Visa/PayPal of day to day use. People would transfer some money onto a coinbase account (like they add money to PayPal) from their own wallet, and use that for day to day spending. Of course, you could also use your main wallet to pay, as enthusiasts will probably do. Recurring/online transactions would likely be from your own wallet as well. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:54:48
Assuming there will even be a Bitcoin core fork, because I'm not sure any miner has committed to mining this minority chain, and I don't think Bitcoin core has implemented those emergency difficulty adjustments that made Bitcoin cash a viable minority fork. In short, this hard fork should be like what would've been if a big block proposal had gotten significant majority before Aug 1st.

Just because it worked out in the end does not change the fact that it was an incredibly stupid decision. Remember about survivorship bias, I'm sure people go all in and lose it all on different investments everyday, this one just worked out, most don't. You need to diversify to invest smart

@_date: 2017-09-04 14:47:07
Many exchanges trade crypto currency for USDT (tether), which is supposed to be a 1:1 token for USD, backed by exactly $1 per tether. However, it's kinda shady. There have been doubts on whether they actually have enough reserves to cover all their tokens, audits haven't gone through like promised, and **it says in the TOS you can't redeem your tethers for USD**. There would be a strong motive for them to issue unbacked tethers, because it basically means free cryptocurrency for themselves. Now could I be wrong, and they are perfectly solvent, with no problems? Sure. But all I'm saying is I would not hold my money in tether for any extended amount of time
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:36:22
Absolutely. Having one client is not decentralized, is a huge security risk, and stifles innovation. "Bitcoin" is the protocol, not the Bitcoin-core (formerly bitcoin-qt) client. Forks of Bitcoin core (fork in this context I mean forking the repo, not the coin) I good for network diversity, but ground up alternative implementations are the best to minimize the risk of sharing security vulnerabilities
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:17:02
Do the exchanges pay for the USDT? I thought the way it works is an exchange *user* is the one selling USDT, and people buy it up for BTC/whatever crypto, not the exchange directly paying tether USD for the USDT. Said user could very well be tether themselves, pumping the price while getting free real money in BTC. However, even if people were paying $1 to tether for every 1 USDT, that still doesn't say anything about whether they've kept it and are solvent or not. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:41:45
Nah, I and many other people abhor tax dodging but love and own Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:40:56
So what do you see Bitcoin as? Just a store of value, that is always converted to fit before it's used?
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:58:06
If the value *doesn't* increase, the incentive to secure the chain by mining goes down over time, which I'm pretty sure is not what he intended. So the system needs the value to increase for it to work properly

@_date: 2017-05-28 15:52:14
Exactly. IMO exchanges should be letting their clients support both segwit and big blocks, and just following the longest chain. They have no business forcing a chain split through things like UASF

It sounds like no one likes the NY agreement. Big blockers don't, because 2mb is not going to last long and they want to evaluate flextrans before activating segwit, and small blockers don't because the wording on activating segwit was vague and this.

Bitcoin is not working fine...
@_date: 2017-06-11 02:56:35
A long time ago, when Bitcoin was in its infancy, a 1mb limit was implemented on blocks to prevent spam transactions. Today, it's obviously not enough, and it's really hurting Bitcoin. So we need to scale. One solution is simply raising the blocksize limit. The competing solution, segwit, is a fix for a problem Bitcoin has, malleability, that also happens to help Bitcoin scale. Some argue that Segwit wouldn't provide as efficient scaling per mb, but it's important to remember it provides other fixes too. Segwit is a pretty radical change to Bitcoin, and some people are scared of what it brings. There are also two methods of upgrading the protocol: a hard fork and a soft fork. "Big blockers" are also worried about the extra code and complexity a soft fork, which segwit was designed as, but isn't necessarily limited to (it could be changed to work with a hard fork) adds. Segwit (or other malleability fixes) enable things like lightning networks, or level 2 scaling (think Paypal, and how they implement transactions on top of banks and cards, but decentralized). Big blockers want to make sure the base network isn't crippled by small blocks in order to force level 2 scaling, but aren't necessarily opposed to level 2 scaling. They also want to look into flextrans, a competing fix for malleability, but generally they would like to use hard forks, not soft forks. "Small blockers" are worried that an increased block size will make Bitcoin less usable, but it's important to note that not everyone has to run a full node to securely use Bitcoin (SPV) and node pruning can help alleviate storage concerns. The miners are short sighted, it seems, and many won't choose either scaling solution because they are getting money now. All of this debate has been going on for over 2 years, and at this  point it's just a bunch of shit slinging and unproductive insults hurled at each other from both sides. You also asked about BIP148 (UASF). The idea behind this is people with nodes want to simply reject blocks from miners that don't signal segwit. IMO, it's a pretty ill-conceived idea that has a low chance of working, but many here would disagree. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:58:26
Newegg accepts Bitcoin directly anyway :)
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:02:09
I think it'd have a pretty bad effect on the market. Besides, why are you so against a blocksize increase? 
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:51:30
Regardless of whether Segwit alleviates scaling issues enough, I expect miners to follow through with the 2mb, or else it wouldn't be much of an agreement at all. Also, I'd expect breaking that agreement would not reflect well on the market price. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 23:28:50
No, segwit was created as a malleability fix, that just so happens to give an "effective block increase", although it's debatable whether that block size increase makes as effective use of the space as a simple block size increase would
@_date: 2017-06-26 02:24:14
So if this such a great scaling solution, why didn't this get more priority? What are the downsides?
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:09:07


Sure, I get that, but we're going to have to hardfork anyway, for the blocksize increase. Why not do it all at once? Despite the soft fork segwit code being well tested, hard forks are simpler code which should make Bitcoin easier to maintain in the long run. Also there's the risk of miners supporting segwit2x to get segwit locked in, then backing out before the 2mb fork if we don't do it all at once. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:39:34
