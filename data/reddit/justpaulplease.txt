So when they sold silkroad coins? :-)

Sign up for bitwage?
@_date: 2016-04-16 19:27:19
Neither. Buy $15k in bitcoin, sit back and hodl (hold) my friend.

What a waste of a couple of miners :-( I know they have no dollar value anymore but I could use an extra couple of bfl60's to add extra heat this winter. I currently have 1 60 and 1 bfl 30 keeping me warm but it's getting colder.

That guy can rhyme! Sending a tip his way. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 14:40:48
Yes. Gourl.io does exactly that. I use it on my wordpress based site.
@_date: 2016-06-06 21:43:17
100%  The question is only when. Why would anyone think they have ended for all time? It depends on how long the extend and pretend policy can last. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 15:42:57
Ahh. No word on a timetable I guess? I'm not trading coin for fiat to advertise or do anything else. I want an end to end bitcoin business. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 17:39:21
@_date: 2015-08-22 17:17:17
It is great for business if it allows for the possibility of automation of your business :-)
@_date: 2015-08-22 15:26:34
but Reddit does for Reddit gold or so I'd read.

I want to buy ads on the Bitcoin sub reddits with bitcoin :-( 
@_date: 2015-08-22 21:37:54
I want to buy ads. I specifically want to buy subreddit headers. I've located several Bitcoin funded ad channels and will stick with them. My product is Bitcoin related FYI. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 17:37:33
Tails is great, thanks so much for doing this!
@_date: 2015-08-20 18:36:55
If you wait until next year for XT to win or lose, you will get to pick the correct fork with the benefit of knowing which side won [which will be built into the price at that point] :-)
don't think you'll be able to buy at these prices if/when the current concerns are resolved. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 00:34:31
A-ads was the one I saw. Thanks for the reference, def plan on using them but was unsure on their inventory and curious about competitors. Not my only ad strategy but the one I'm seeking help on. 
Paul. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 00:29:03
Thanks everyone, especially that pro tip :-)
@_date: 2015-08-30 23:28:43
I think  does a great job of explaining the issue and correct resolution. No affiliation, just read it recently and then this thread popped up! Perhaps you could collaborate?
@_date: 2015-08-15 02:03:48
Coinbank for sure but if you are in NYC the alternatives seem to be dropping like flies.

"Millennials and liberals are too busy advancing gay right than defending freedom"
Advancing gay rights is defending gay freedom, how can you not see your obvious contradiction?
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:16:08
A-ads.com is a quick and simple one. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 16:24:08
 maybe?
@_date: 2015-09-07 20:25:35
Niicely done!!!!
@_date: 2015-09-02 01:32:12
Get yourselves a tails USB drive folks!
@_date: 2015-10-09 23:50:43
Interesting idea. Joined. 
@_date: 2015-10-03 01:06:00
Yep. Checked my report. Sent them half a dozen new customers but not a satori for me. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 16:13:42
Always has been. Jesus threw the money lenders out of the temple and hung out with a prostitute. Which bible did this author read?
@_date: 2016-05-19 00:35:07
As the top performing asset of 2015 it was a perfect hedge against anything :-)
@_date: 2015-10-24 00:22:42
Chilling. 
@_date: 2015-10-23 17:43:08
Maybe? For sure. Disapointing but no surprise. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 20:42:29
@_date: 2015-10-13 20:22:58
Hell yes!
@_date: 2015-10-18 20:35:21
I use  on my site for exactly that. Worth checking out. 
@_date: 2015-10-09 20:15:01
Second vote for bitwage. Good people.

The town in Southeast England where the whitepaper was written??? :-)

I used to have my sailboat in Baltimore Inner Harbor listed on AirBnB a couple of years ago and rented it out a bunch of times. Maybe I'll list it on OpenBazaar....
I wouldn't bother for stinking fiat but if it could help get me into the 21 club :-)
@_date: 2016-07-03 18:11:05
Don't forget to account for air con power requirements in your calculations.
@_date: 2016-07-15 00:43:07
Downvoted for being sexist. Women are the majority of the people on this planet. Maybe you'd appreciate their help with making bitcoin mainstream?
@_date: 2016-07-18 16:34:18
Um, inheritance? Far from all rich people play the game better, they just won the vagina lottery and were born into money.

Didn't the banks change the name excel to blockchain?
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:23:10
If you don't pay people, do they normally work? Was that penny or nickel too much to part with?
