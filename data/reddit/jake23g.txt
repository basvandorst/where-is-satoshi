Congrats on your success with Bitcoin. But telling someone to sell off the rest of their diversified portfolio and put it all into crypto is ridiculous. We all know how highly speculative the crypto market is and the risk that comes with it. Being diversified is extremely important. Putting all of your eggs in one basket is a good way to lose it all.

It's a decent amount for me, but that's relative. I'm not nervous because I know it will either confirm or cancel at some point, and it's being sent from one of my wallets to another. I can't wait until it's in my segwit supported ledger wallet..

I'm not sure what that stands for?

That's what I'm trying to do by sending it to my new segwit supported ledger wallet, I just need to get it there... I also realize it is a low fee, but a few months ago a fee like that would be processed in a day or two. I was just curious if I had any other option other than waiting.

Day 19 unconfirmed at 60.3 sat/b. Hopefully soon..

Thanks I'll take a look when I'm off work

I've literally been unconfirmed for 8 days going on 9 now...I chose a low fee but it wouldn't take more than a day or two not too long ago.

I made a transfer from breadwallet to ledger and set low fees that used to take ~1 day and I'm at 5 days and counting still unconfirmed. I know I'm the one that made the decision of low fee but damn. The wait continues...but at least ledger supports segwit.

I'm on day 13 of a 60.3 sat/B
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:22:42
I believe it was 63 but I'd have to double check. I sent it from my breadwallet to my new ledger I bought. 
Edit: it was 60.3, this is my transaction ID

Interesting. I had heard the system would kick back transaction that weren't getting picked up do to low fees. Well my 60.3 s/b isn't crazy low so it's just a waiting game. Hopefully within the next couple days..

Now sitting at 13 days unconfirmed. This really sucks. Trying to stay positive but it's disheartening. I wanted to trim some of my investment when it was around 19k but my coins were still in limbo. I don't have any option but wait, do I?
