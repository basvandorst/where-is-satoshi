I have a very easy way of pulling BTC onto a preloaded debit card.  It's a Visa and I've used it everywhere, including atms (which charge a fee) so if you want paper cash you just go to the grocery store and say you want cash back at the point of checkout and you don't get charged a fee.  I've already pulled out way more money than I've invested into fiat before this crash.  Not worried.  I don't just keep all my crypto gains in crypto.
I also have a couple of BTC holding accounts that I can transfer money to the debit card very quickly or back to the exchange if I have a loss on a trade.

I've made mad BTC since the crash just trading on Bittrex.  This is a great opportunity for traders.
That being said, who do you think is buying all the BTC that people are panick selling?  The Chinese government.  They're buying it up in hoards for two reasons.
1. They want to limit the power of their own people to have a currency that the government is quickly losing control of.  They are trying to stop it now within their own boarders.
2. They know a lot of Americans and other countries are going to follow the panic and sell, so they are buying it up like candy.  And they're gonna hoard it.  America owes China a lot of money and this is a clever way to get it back, not just from the US govt but from the American people directly.
They're going to hoard BTC and the BTC you own now is going to be worth a whole lot more than it is now after the recovery.  Hold your position.  I'm not selling anything.  I'm just trading up at this point and gaining more BTC on the exchanges.  That is the smart thing to do in the long run- the exchange rate will rise and it will rise higher than ever before.  My estimate is 7-10k usd in the next 3 months after this happens.  Remember there is a finite amount of BTC out there, and if the Chinese hoard it all it's going to cause the exchange rate to skyrocket.
Use your head people.
