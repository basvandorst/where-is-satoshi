I wish. I'm playing it safe and only investing what I can afford to lose.

I gave it a shot, lost $20. I've been hoping to recoup by hodling, and I'm almost there. I don't have very much in the game, so it's a slow crawl.

I've already got around $15 back in a week, but things have been a little slow, so I'm not expecting to fully recoup for at least another week. It was worth the learning experience, I admit day trading just isn't my thing :)

You are fake news.

I bought at 18k. It is what it is.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:08:38
I sold lower than I originally bought in, yes. I then bought back in at a higher price than my sell or my original buy. I was trying to move things around between some other currencies, and I wasn't smart about it.
Right this moment I'm hodling.

Yes. I'm not a confident trader, so I bought in hoping to be buying before a gain, but it ended up dropping right after my buy.
Also p.s. I'm playing with multiple currencies, the hit I took was mostly on litecoin, but all of them have fluctuated above and below my buy in point.

You're focusing too much on the bribing aspect. The overall intention of what I'm saying is this: If the people making the laws made less money (more similar to the wages an average citizen makes) I think (my opinion) that the lawmaking process would improve and the resulting laws would be more beneficial for the masses.

You took the time to put the $200k number out there and I'm just saying by comparison $15k is a heck of a lot less than $200k. What I'm getting at is I think there are benefits to putting the average person in charge of making laws rather than overpaid and often bribed people. If the position itself were regulated and restricted to be more of an average citizen level position financially I think it would be more beneficial to the whole.


I agree with you on this. I have no idea how to detect it, but we all know it's happening, and it seems like when it does happen there are no consequences. What I would hope for is that there WOULD be consequences and they be severe enough to remove someone from their position and hopefully negate any benefits they received from the bribe itself. Ex: If someone accepted a $200 bribe (hypothetically) they would be removed from their position and fined $200. This isn't a perfect idea, and I know it's not exactly like this conversation is being watched and will be used for the basis of our government, so I'm just throwing out ideas that I think would make a difference. That difference might be a bad difference, because I'm not 100% educated on how everything works, I'm just openly discussing ideas.

$200k &gt; $15k last time I checked. Also it would make sense to have some kind of checks and balances in place that prevent them from taking any kind of bribes in relation to their position as a lawmaker. Removing someone from a seat should be more common when things like this are found. Honestly I'm surprised we don't do that already.

Then I will say this: I don't know how to remove the bribes from the equation, but I feel like if we did things would be better.

This app was around for a long time before they added BTC to it. I haven't tried any of the BTC parts of the app, but I've used everything else in the app for a long time for various purposes. I've received payments from freelance work, I've split checks, I've even paid rent with this app. It's been a handy thing to have. Hopefully they handle BTC well.

I'm not so sure about that idea unless you only do it for the president and then you also make all Congress and house positions mandatory minimum wage. If they aren't allowed to have ridiculous salaries and the only incentive they have will be to actually make good laws that benefit others. The shitty people in it for the money would drop out real quick. Laws would probably be decided on faster too since there would be more incentive to make the country do well enough to justify minimum wage increase or other quality of life improvements for all citizens (including themselves). Then I think it would be interesting to do a random person every 2 years. It would keep fresh perspective.

Now we need to convince Lambo to accept Bitcoin.

Are you saying we haven't ever had an idiot president?
