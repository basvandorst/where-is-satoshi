Are you fucking serious? Do you know how bitcoin got started, with dark net transactions? That was the foundation of bitcoin

This I am not sure. It seems like people have successfully paid in the past, so unless they all waited half an hour to pay.... 
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:16:02
Yes I was. Should I not have? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:07:38
Yep, looking back, 100% my fault. Oh well, I'm numb to this whole thing and I have washed my hands of btc. Can't do anything about it anymore unfortunately. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:00:21
Please, and I'm being serious here, how do I then? If I can't buy stuff through bitpay then what *can* I use it for?

Would give you a thousand upvotes if I could. Thanks for actually being sympathetic. The community was definitely a lot more kinder back in the day haha.

Thank you for being sympathetic, it helps take away the sting.

Apparently from the other comments it appears you can't use it for food or transacting anything.... It's like cash, but you can't spend it.

I was, until my couple hundred that I had written off suddenly were worth thousands.

At the risk of sounding "get off my lawn", back in the days of early bitcoin we used to transact food, drugs, even small favors with it. Nowadays it seems like everybody is just "hodl"ing and the spirit of actually *spending* coins is gone. Sad to see that it has come to this.

Then what do I use bitcoin for? Back in my day (Got started in 2012) transactions were centered around food and small bitcoin shops. You may know about the million dollar pizza. It was ALL about food. Perhaps you have no clue what YOU'RE talking about.

I really wish people were more helpful than slinging insults. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:14:18
I assure you friend, it is not. Now before you don't believe me, I ask you, when was the last time YOU bought anything with btc? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:04:23
Thanks man. Believe me, nobody wants to 'fix' this more than me after these experiences, but literally have no idea where to start or to remediate the situations that have burned me. Seriously, how do I go about 'fixing' these issues?

Everyone who said that liquidating the mtgox coins will be negligible on btc market prices, THIS is what happens.
