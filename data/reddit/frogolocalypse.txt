You know what?  I've just figured out that you don't get this.  So I'm going to do you a favor.
What you've got there sunshine, is a character fault.  You clearly don't get the ethics of this.  So I've got a bit of an experiment for you... 
I'm sure you work at a place that has a HR department?  Or perhaps you know someone in a management position in HR?  Why don't you go and ask them : As an employee, is it ethically ok to recommend a service, without letting the person who you're recommending it to, know that you are an employee of that service provider.  It's a fairly straight-forward question.  Write it down if you're not sure you'll remember it.
Oh, and the other thing... is this HR person a friend of yours?  Because don't do this if they're not a friend of yours.  Any person in any position of authority knows the answer to this, and if they aren't a friend, and you ask this kind of question, you're going to quickly be marked down in a "I kind of have to keep my eye on this employee, because they clearly don't understand ethics" file.  
Telling you that last bit was the favor.  In some industries like financial advice (of which coinbase is a service supplier) it can actually be a crime.

Look dude, I don't wanna argue with ya.  I hope these efforts of cryptocurrencies succeed.  But I'm just saying, from what I see, it doesn't look good.  And if you were a smart guy, you'd be making sure your exposure to coinbase was limited.  I think they've made a big play into ETH, and depending on how big that play was kind of decides how much they're going to lose.

&lt;wince&gt;  That statement is so lacking in insight, experience, and understanding, that it is impossible to take seriously any 'developer' that would be able to utter it in public.  I could understand a school-child having that attitude, but someone that demonstrates such a stunning lack of insight as an adult is effectively irredeemable.  It is so far away from an acceptable skill-set for a developer, that the only way it could be uttered by an intelligent person, would be because they were actively trolling for some unexplained reason, or be because they were suffering from a personality disorder.

I've stopped trying to be nice to you people.  Being nice just leads to morons shouting over the top of you because they never actually use their brains and work these things out for themselves.  You had an opinion on this subject because your mind has been polluted by the rbtc conspiracy nut-job community, and when someone (i.e. me) bothered to put even two minutes work into debunking that high-dea of yours, your entire premise came un-stuck.
Just stop it.  Stop with the needless negativity, and actually start figuring this stuff out for yourself.  You won't get me criticizing you in this way, if you demonstrate you've actually made some effort to understand how the technology even works at all.

Because if you're insolvent, any responsible business managers would be handing over the assets to specialists who would be better suited to getting the business out of the hole they're in (and ensuring the creditors can retrieve as much of their money as possible), rather than relying upon the people who put them in it in the first place.

I'd say think of this more along the lines of central banks.  Right now, a significant portion of liquidity has been taken from the market, at least for the time-being.  Same thing happened with the zombie property market in the GFC.  The role of a central bank, when liquidity falls, is to print money (quantitative easing is the new euphemism) in order to lower the price of debt.  Otherwise, interest rates rise, because there is more competition for liquidity.
The stolen coins are out of the market at least for the time-being (zombie coins?).  There isn't a central bank, so the only thing that has happened is that liquidity has dropped.
On the demand side, sure, there is less.  That's the spike downward, and there shouldn't be any surprise about it.  But as long as those coins stay effectively out of the market, liquidity is lowered, and the ongoing demand should increase, in a less liquid market.
Do I think it'll all even out in the end?  Sure.  But I can't see how this won't lead to a liquidity squeeze as soon as the dust settles on bfx.

We don't 'know' anything.  We have a few forum posts from a bitfinex pr person that they've contacted law enforcement.  There's no evidence that they've contacted any, or indeed, which law enforcement entities have been contacted.
Bitgo would not have been necessary in order to take-out this hack if undertaken by bitfinex.  
But I agree, the way to get to the bottom of it is through the police.  But they're no-where to be seen, now are they?

If you are an american, you need to go do the FBI at this link :
Don't take bitfinex's vague reddit mentions about the fbi and 'european authorities' as actual action on investigating the 75 million dollar hack.
We know the CFTC has regulatory control over them, because they've been fined in the past. Don't wait people, the silence from bfx is deafening. You can file a complaint, and/or can report suspicious activity directly to the CFTC here :
If you don't contact them, you deserve to lose your money.

There's a difference between 'some' and 'all'.  It sucks that people have bad experiences, especially with law enforcement, but not all of them are bad.  It's ludicrous to think so.


Most law enforcement agencies do actually have to state that an investigation is underway if asked.  My question is whether law enforcement has even been notified that a crime has taken place, such that they feel they even have a crime to investigate.

This is only going to end with people in prison.  I was making a, what I think, educated guess about who was responsible for this theft, based upon the lack of law-enforcement exposure.  Then, a little while ago, I read this :
... about the CEO of bitfinex Raphael Nicolle,.  Now, I don't think there's any doubt.  These guys have simply stolen that money.
I've given a little bit of advice (that I hope is taken) to a rep from bitfinex that they need to contact the authorities, as in RIGHT NOW, but we'll see what happens.
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:00:24
I said "and/or law enforcement authority" which should include any appropriate authority that could be contacted.  In Australia, you WOULD contact the AFP (Australian Federal Police), including ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission).  Different countries have different appropriate regulatory bodies.

That's the problem.  Other people don't care what you think is 'good enough'.  


A standard internet connection in Australia won't handle 2mb, let alone 8mb.  Australia is one of the largest per-capita users of bitcoin.  You think it's a good idea to remove our ability to run a full-node because 'you think' it's ok?

I didn't want to get too technical, just to demonstrate scales.  When i said less chance that less chance is even more remarkable.  There are 10^80 bitcoin addresses for every atom in the universe. The only reason i chose a DNA strand was because 220 million atoms would encompass all used addresses there have ever been.  I could have said a universe within each atom, and it would still be right.

You check first?  You spend an hour one day to figure it all out.  You install it and write down the seed.  You send $1, and check it.  You delete the app.  Reboot it.  You create a new seed.

Surely if you're going to be dumping money into this thing, you'd do that, right?

Lol.  Ethereum isn't actually used for anything.  That's the point.  It's a speculative play, and I don't see anything wrong with people making speculative plays, but that's what it is.
Since the fork in ETH to ETC, ETH has dropped 25% of its value in order to make an immutable ledger mutable because of a badly coded contract that made the founders lose money that had nothing to do with the protocol.  If bitcoin had done the same because of the collapse of Mt.Gox, there wouldn't be any bitcoin anymore.
It's a dead-set disaster, and it has a long way to go before the the car-crash even stops moving, let alone stops burning.  The fear of the ETH pumpers is palpable.

Err... no they don't.  Good ones that solve crimes get promoted and more money.  That's how policing works.
Seriously dude, I've looked at your comment history, because this thought-process is bizarre.  But you're not a whacko.  What gives?  Police investigate and solve crimes.  That's what they do.  If a crime isn't even reported, no matter how good your private investigator might be, no-one is going to prison.  If you want someone to go to prison, they have to be convicted of a crime.  If you want someone convicted of a crime, you actually have ask the police to establish a crime has been committed.  This is really simple stuff.

It's easy to create very large volumes to put anything you want in truecrypt 7.1a
You can create a 500gb volume (or more, or less) and put whatever you want in it.  It just appears as an extra drive on your PC (which is configurable) whenever you mount it using the utility.  You can use the utility on linux, microsoft or osx, and open up any volume created in any of them.  You can even create hidden volumes so that a different instance appears depending on the password used.  Then you can just backup the volume on a portable hd and move it off-site.
It's still the most secure disk-encryption tool ever created.

People who wanted free shit found out the shit they wanted for free wasn't, in fact, free. They stopped attempting to get shit for free so txn volume went down.   By design.

That is the exact opposite of a double-spend.  It isn't letting you double-spend.  The point.

I think there's a big difference between what has been said, and what has actually happened.  So it should be really easy for them to state which law enforcement agencies have been contacted, so you can verify that an investigation is underway.  
I really really really hope I'm wrong, and if I find out I am wrong, I'm going to make sure it's posted right up top so that it's the first thing that people see.  But right now, this looks like nothing more than an exit scam, and their new 'proposal' simply looks like a way to ensure their theft is legitimized, and they can take their funds, and use them as they will.  The classic exit scam, except no consequences.

No they don't.  That's a straw-man of the conspiracy nutjob rbtc crowd.

No.  Eliminating the limit leads to a reduction in nodes which leads to control of nodes and a censorship attack vector. The fact that you don't get this effectively removes you from the decision making process for this discussion.

No.  They don't.  It's called multi-sig.  Look it up.
EDIT:  It's actually even simpler than that.  It's simply multiple input/outputs.  Oh dear... you can't even figure that part out?
EDIT2:  Actually, I think it's still multi-sig.  Multiple users sign a txn, and then those grouped txnid's are committed in a single block-chain txn commit.  That's multi-sig.  The multiple outputs are the completion of that single txn.
Suddenly so quiet ? Those insults of yours seem to have dried up? Perhaps you should be lending that genius intellect of yours to the task!

Don't come here then, and if the rbtc numpties have the same courtesy, we won't all tire ourselves having to relentlessly put that stupid genie back in its bottle. 
@_date: 2016-08-30 07:08:36
So no proof.
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:06:27
Actually, these types of txn's are exactly the type of txn's that gain the most out of segwit.  There will be more of an impetus to use it.  Indeed, the very system that enables the channels would more-than-likely incorporate a segwit wallet for exactly this purpose.  Not only that, but you'd be providing a financial incentive to miners, because you would be providing a large bulk of txn's that only segwit enabled miners would be able to capitalize on.
And even after all that, assuming you were correct (and you're not), when you haven't even worked out a fairly straight-forward break-down like I did, it would mean the difference between 12.7 days and 25 days.
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:47:00

You I especially feel for dude.  My stomach sinks every time I think of the money they've fleeced from you.  It really makes me mad.
When there's a liquidation of the assets (and the sooner the better) I don't think there's going to be any way that all creditors will be treated equally.  I really think that's the best you can hope for.  The best you can hope for is the recovery of the theft from what seems like bitfinex.  Maybe the threat of many years in prison will enable that.

All of you people do realise that if there is no crime committed, the people who have the coins right now will be able to use them without fear of law-enforcement, right?  Hell, they could even use them on the same exchange.
Now if I were someone planning an exit-scam, like for an example, the management of bitfinex, this sounds like a pretty novel way of pocketing 70 million dollars.  With no law-enforcement involvement, I would say it's a pretty successful one.

When **at least** two of the law enforcement officers that were responsible for investigating his case subsequently went to jail for corruption in exactly his case, and those facts weren't allowed to be included in the trial, there is a legitimate question about whether his rights were violated.

Yes.  That's what he said.  But that's it.  So which law enforcement authority did bitfinex contact?  Like, as in, exactly?  This isn't confidential information, it's the opposite.

I responded also in [the post]( because, you know, I was actually right the first time.
EDIT2: Actually, I think it's still multi-sig. Multiple users sign a txn, and then those grouped txnid's are committed in a single block-chain txn commit. That's multi-sig. The multiple outputs are the completion of that single txn.

Err.  No.
Tell me genius, why can't there be a layer2 txn between channels?

So tell me, genius, how long do you think a channel needs to be open for?
In fact, does it ever need to be closed? Tell me genius. Think hard. Have a rest. We are all salivating upon the gems of your intellect.
So... let us assume you had 100 million users. How long do you think it will take to get that many? At least a few years, right?
100,000,000 / 7 txns a sec = 14285714 / 60 secs per minute = 238095 / 60 minutes per hour = 3968 / 24 hours per day = 165 days worth of txns.
Not even half a year.

They're not though. They aren't likely to wind up back in circulation in any short time-frame, unless the hackers really feel like getting caught that is.   They're like satoshi coins.  They're not providing liquidity.
So what happens after the fear and flagellation?  A significant amount of a not-very-large pool of coins that is used for trading just got smaller, and the supply (block-reward) just got smaller.  Surely this at least theoretically is going to lead to a squeeze isn't it?

You're obviously a little lacking in the self-reflection category.  That whole "ask anyone i've worked with/for..." also has a few red-flags associated with it too.
Like I said, give it a go.  Perhaps someone you know personally will provide you some insight that this exchange won't, and frankly, you need.  As I said before, it's clear you don't get it.  It's a character fault.  The only question is whether you want to take the time to recognize it.

Exactly.   Now with an entire community of pointy headed morons opining on things they know very little of, and actively undermining the actual experts, it takes a little bit more thought and planning.

I'd say there's still some concern that the 'hack' was an inside job that pocketed people within bitfinex tens of millions of dollars. The age old exit scam. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 16:01:58
I'd love to see the money that has been stolen returned to the people who lost it, and for people responsible for the theft to wind up in prison.  But if you think that bitfinex is ever going to trade again, you're totally kidding yourself, and the only question is how much is going to be lost, and who is going to wind up in prison.
The guy has just stolen the money.  And by all accounts, no-one has even reported a theft of 70 million dollars has occurred.
@_date: 2016-04-07 03:26:32
It's a nice story, but I'd prefer if the whole gambling element in the bitcoin community would find something else to be interested in.  Most of the division in the community is driven by people who want a quick buck and damn the consequences, ceaselessly attempting to undermine the part of the community that wants the technology to be expanded in a safe and secure way.  I want bitcoin to be used in 20 years, not just the next two.
I'm glad some people made a lot of money in the past.  Good on em.  But I much more want to have this system as a long-term store of value, and transfer of value system.

@_date: 2016-08-08 09:37:15
And you'll see a little term in there called 'if you agree to this, you give up your right to sue' and then the theft by bitfinex becomes legitimized.  Thanks for the 70 mil.  Come back again.

Personally I think there's a crime, but I haven't lost any money.  If BFX doesn't report a crime, and no-one else reports a crime, I guess I'm wrong and no crime has been committed.
BFX PR said they'd contacted law enforcement.  I want to find out whether they did, and have actually reported that there has been a crime.  If they haven't actually done that, and it's going to be pretty easy to verify, you probably should be questioning why that is the case.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:14:49

You're missing the point.  Like seriously.  The protection from scammers is to understand bitcoin.  If you don't understand that, why are you using bitcoin?
Edit: I understand the security issues with SPV wallets.   But when you have the private keys and nothing else, you still have control of your money.  The private key is everything in bitcoin. 
But spv wallets are not what we're talking about.

When they buy something, they use bitcoin.  Without money, they can't buy stuff.  The money is bitcoin.  They spend that bitcoin, which is money.  To buy stuff.  Through the LN.  With their wallet.  That uses bitcoin.  And the LN.  Through a channel.  Which is part of the LN.  Which is money.  With bitcoin.  Using the LN.  With bitcoin they own.  To buy stuff.  With bitcoin.  Using the LN.

I think it'll be pretty damning, and effectively make the investigation about bfx, if you find they haven't contacted any law enforcement bodies, in spite of having said they were doing so.
But you're right... if you've lost money you should be contacting your bank, and/or if you're in one of the countries that bfx took deposits from, your corporate regulatory body and/or the corporate regulatory body in italy and/or HK.

Coinbase spent a good amount of goodwill capital attacking core developers through the media over an extended period of time.  It was designed and achieved its specific aim of achieving division.

We know the CFTC has regulatory control over them, because they've been fined in the past. Don't wait people, the silence from bfx is deafening. You can file a complaint, and/or can report suspicious activity directly to the CFTC here :

No.  Learn how to do it correctly.  The most important thing to understand in bitcoin is that if you don't control the private keys, it's not your money.  It makes no difference whether it is $10 or $10,000 worth of bitcoin.  The only determining factor for whether you should move coins from an online wallet to a wallet you control the private keys to, is whether the mining fee is such that it is uneconomical to do so.  
@_date: 2016-04-23 03:40:39

Coming from what looks like a representative of circle (and looking through your history, it's clear you are one), one should read your comments with a grain of salt.
The reason people don't like coinbase is because they've led a public relations campaign to undermine the primary bitcoin development team, and have attempted to sideline them.  I don't really have much against circle, except when shills like you  speak of all how wonderful they are without any thought into why people should question their motives.  Frankly, I had enough of you lot with the constant igot shills, and look what's happened to them?
Bitcoin users need to secure their coins.  That's the point of bitcoin.  A mycelium wallet and any exchange account (coinjar, xapo, circle, coinbase, etc, etc, ad nauseum) will suffice, and you don't have to trust a company in a space that is replete with scammers.

I notice a lot of FUD on 7.1a, but I've never even heard of a problem of actually cracking it.  There have been issues faced in specific instances where some OS's didn't generate perfectly random keys, but outside of those edge cases, it is as secure now as it has ever been.
If I were the tinfoil-hat type, I would opine that the NSA (or equivalent) got to the developers, and forced them to shut it down, and ever since then have been trying to convince people it isn't safe.  Not because it isn't safe, but because there is, in fact, no way to crack it.

Not unless it's used it isn't?  Sure, if it winds back on exchanges, I totally see it.  But the chances of that happening in the short-term are very small, because the coins will be watched so intently.  More to the point is WHERE the coins were taken from.  An exchange.  A place specifically utilized as liquidity for price discovery.
I think of them more like satoshi coins.  If Satoshi came back and started selling his (its?) coins the market would plummet, because the supply would increase so dramatically.  This is the same problem in reverse isn't it?

People will use bitcoin because of its functionality which, yes, includes a component of value protection.  The deflationary aspect of bitcoin is what it's all about after all.  But the gamblers are the ones that think they're going to get a 1000% return in a couple of years because "MASS ADOPTION NOW AT ALL COSTS! is more important than it's long term value proposition as the deflationary store of value.
New users are great.  New users that are only interested in short-term gain, not-so-great.
@_date: 2016-04-06 09:48:19
I'm not sure they'll commit many transactions to the blockchain, nor would they really be expected to.  I think the fact that they're using the bitcoin price as the mark about which they're compared big enough.
Either way, they're going to eat companies like western union for breakfast wherever they expand to.
@_date: 2016-04-08 11:54:38
I'd like that, but I've never actually seen any commitment/document that says that that is going to happen.
@_date: 2016-04-28 09:53:24
I know.  But if someone were to provide an alternate pruned chain, without the full chain, it would be impossible to verify.  In normal circumstances, probably not a big thing, but not ideal.  You also wouldn't be able to determine where the payment came from beyond the last unspent output.

And now you start understanding the problem of induction.  You chose it because it was in your mind.  Why was it in your mind?  Who knows, was it because of [framing effects]( or was it just as a result of how many coins you had in your pocket.  Either way, a true request for random numbers, which equates to an infinite gamut, was answered in the tightest possible terms based upon the thought processes of the person being asked the question.  Would a computer answer the same way?  The chances of 1 being chose are as equally low as 65,302,332,826,400.
Now imagine that ALL minds work this way, and not just for the things like this, which are deliberately there to misdirect you.  Imagine ALL pattern recognition worked the same way.  We're not asking how tall someone is (which has a range) but perhaps how rich someone is (which doesn't).  The ratio between your height, and someone elses, is something that will meet a bell curve.  The ratio between your asset holdings and someone like bill gates, won't.  Because you think in the terms of bell curves, but in some things, bell curves seriously don't cut it.
When you understand this issue, you will start questioning all of these easy and knee-jerk 'understandings'.  They aren't understandings.  They're your brain giving you the illusion of understanding, and moving on as if it is settled.  The world and its ratios has much more to do with you and bill gates than it does between you and your brother.  We don't live in bell-curve science.  That works right up until the time it doesn't.

In all fairness though, ltc has matched btc gains this year.   Even a bit better.   One year ago it was $3.  Now it is $125.   I think this is actually because of ltc being a hedge for btc.  As a person who bought them at $10 when bitmain started with their bullshit, the gains have actually been in line.  Shows what happens when you align with bitcoin.

I don't see it.  They are risk-averse.  If banking were actually starting to invest in crypto, I would expect the market-cap of bitcoin to be in the trillions.
The thing to look at in crypto isn't the market-cap.  It's a meaningless value.  The thing to look at is the trade volume.  Bitcoin had a trading volume of about 16B over the past 24 hours.  The forex market is estimated at 5 trillion per day.  That's the stuff that banks are trading.  If even a single large bank started acquiring bitcoin it would skyrocket even more than it has done so far this year.  If you have 16B in trade, that's a lot of back/forth trading of a relatively small amount of 4-5 billion max worth of coins (maybe even 1-2 billion).  If you remove 2billion of that because a bank acquires it, the price would jump astronomically.
I think that most bitcoin traffic is still very much individual consumer investors, and a couple of larger individual ones.  If banks are doing this, I would expect that it will only be minor amounts so that they can build the processes to ensure they can safely manage the instrument if and when they do decide to.

Ah the ol no intrinsic value meme. I use [the 1:10000 rule]( for this argument.  It is my opinion that the intrinsic value of bitcoin is far far greater than anyone really comprehends.  People generally are too focused on people just buying and selling the asset, but not about the cryptographic proof, and incentive structure that perpetuates the network functioning.  So when people like to ask what the intrinsic value of bitcoin is, I say :
You are thinking of the store of value property without the cryptographic property that secures it. You are talking about it as one would talk about valuable shells, and even shell sellers, and not the security that separates it from all forms of value exchange before it. To understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin it is good to use the analogy of an envelope. So i ask you : does an envelope have intrinsic value?
If I have a letter that I need to send securely, would I prefer to send it open, and ready to be read? Or would I prefer for it to be sent within the confines of an envelope? Now let's think... would I prefer to just leave an open envelope, or would I think it necessary to put some seal across it to ensure that it isn't opened, and read whilst en-route. Does a sealable envelope have more intrinsic value than an unsealable one? Hmm... but what if someone can counterfeit the seal? I need some method of ensuring that the message I want to get to that person isn't read, and preferably, isn't even identified as a message. That's when you need to get lawyers involved. Sounds expensive. There's obviously something intrinsically valuable about such a service, because many people pay oh-so-very-much money for it.
Now let's imagine we're not talking about letters, we're talking about money. Would you address a $100 note through the mail to your child for their birthday? You'd pay for a stamp at least. Would you encase it in an envelope that you paid for at the local post-shop? Hmm... bill in the envelope.  Anyone will be able to see that it is money. Perhaps encase it in a card? What if it is $1000? $10,000? $10 million?  Does the protection service of an envelope somehow decrease because the value of the contents of the package increases? It's the opposite, isn't it? Bitcoin is both the cryptographically sealed envelope, and the network to deliver it.
What say you? Is an envelope intrinsically valuable?

That is completely immaterial.  It is only important servicing your requirement.  If you have a node, you can use bitcoin, regardless of whether you are a listening node.
It really sounds like you want to do this the right way.  I would suggest running a pruned node without listening.  You can do almost anything if you do this.  After you sync, you might even want to run it over TOR.

 shorting has been available for years. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:59:50


Every blocksize, even segwit, increases the resource requirements of running a node.  It is the nodes, and only the nodes, that define and police consensus in bitcoin, the fundamental rule-set that makes it work.  
Segwit was a compromise that allowed fundamental architecture changes (malleability fix, quadratic hashing) that improved bitcoin permanently, but also offered a blocksize increase, if the new technology was used.  Segwit is ultimately the malleability fix.
There are approximately 150,000 bitcoin nodes that people use.  Most are not on all of the time.  Only a small proportion of them make themselves available for recording transactions from non-nodes.  Every full node has a complete copy of the blockchain, and a pool of transactions that they synch with every other node.
Every single node needs to synch, from scratch, every single transaction of the blockchain in order to arrive at the current state of the blockchain.  The larger the blockchain they have to synch, the larger the resource requirements.  But it's not only that.  Most people are selfish.  They download without providing resources to others.  In order for bitcoin to function, it needs nodes to serve the blockchain, and the transaction memory pool, to all of those nodes.  To the ones that contribute less.   Every time you increase the resource requirements, you make more of them quit.  That is bad.  That is what kills decentralization, the one thing that bitcoin shits all over every other alt with.

That's not really the way it works though.

I do imagine a grocery store or pub will have a number of channels open though, because lots of people will do business with them.

It doesn't really matter what you think though, does it?  Nor me of course.  If people want to build layering solutions on top of bitcoin they can and they will, and that is their right.  It won't make me use them, but if they see a value proposition for that service, good for them.
Armstrong looks like he's finally at least got the message that his opinion on the architecture of bitcoin isn't wanted, and anything he has supported in the past 18 months in that regard has been rejected.  He should stick to the business of coinbase, and delivering services to his customers, without attempting to reduce the security of the network.  If he can keep doing that, everyone wins.

They aren't getting 'used', they are getting added to.  The only thing that is happening is channels are being rebalanced.  Chanel between A/B goes from 60% to 65%, and channel between B/C goes from 65% to 60%.  Your entire argument is 'whale will throw their money away in order to make people re-balance their channels'.
You should really quit with the FUD until you actually know what you're talking about.

 You should really learn how lightning works.  It's great.  Because what you think? That ain't lightning. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:28:58
So what you're saying is, you don't really understand how LN works?
Lightning allows users to take a single bitcoin transaction, and use it over a finite space of time, in order to shift bitcoin back and forth, with no or vanishingly small transaction fees, as iou's between what are called 'lightning channels'. The actual transaction size will be the same as a normal transaction, with a flag that says it can only be committed to the blockchain at a specific time (or block depth). In effect, these lightning transactions are cryptographically signed 'iou's. The 'thousands' of back-and-forth iou changes are discarded when the channel is closed (massive privacy dividend), and only the aggregated change is committed to the blockchain. This is the great thing about lightning. It is a single transaction with as many inputs and outputs (one/two) as defined in the original transaction. Only the transaction values change.
Consider a channel link of this : John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne. Only the people next to each other in the chain have a 'channel open' with each other (John/Bob, Bob/Sally, Sally/Anne). Assuming each of the channels between all of the participants have adequate funds in order to achieve this, if John wanted to send 1btc to Anne. A transaction ledger would read :
John-&gt;Bob channel : John -1btc, Bob +1btc
Bob-&gt;Sally channel : Bob -1btc, Sally +1btc
Sally-&gt;Anne channel : Sally -1btc, Anne +1btc.
Anne now has 1btc more, and John has 1btc less, but the net effect in each channel is simply a modification to the distribution of bitcoin in that channel.
Imagine this happening, back and forth, and extended to thousands, tens of thousands, and millions of people. As long as there's a chain between them, you use the chain. You might even have your transaction split over multiple chains. For links that don't have a chain, you create a channel on-the-fly.
Each channel, therefore, only ends up with the same single input, and the same two outputs, just differing values.
It's significantly more complex than that (transaction routing, and channel closure mechanics), but that's the idea. I wish I could remember the lightning dev that explained it. It really is very clever. I haven't actually questioned about the effect of having channels with multiple inputs (John/Sally) and outputs (Bob/Anne) at inception. Technically, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible. Just a much weirder set of ramifications.
I would suggest that the method for creating ln channels is most likely :  Carol wants to pay Bob 0.5btc.  She creates a ln channel with 1btc, of which Bob is allocated 0.5btc, and carol is allocated 0.5btc.  Bob gets paid 0.5btc that is accessible once confirmed.  Carol has 0.5btc that is now accessible once confirmed.  That way the ln can be bootstrapped by existing txns.
I'd also suggest that it would be easier to understand if Bob were Bob Inc.  The incentive will be for the buyer to reduce txn fees.  If Carol uses a store (coffee?) she will want to reduce paying those fees.   So she creates a channel with 0.1btc and 0.001 is allocated to Bob Inc. For the coffee she buys today, coffee + txn fee.  Ever more?  Zippo txn fee.   When your channel is almost zero, you buy bitcoin, it is delivered back to you by the rebalancing of that channel. And because it's Bob Inc the path through the channels from a source of bitcoin is reduced, maybe even two hops ( exchangeA/exchangeB -&gt; exchangeB/Bob Inc. -&gt; Bob Inc./Carol).  
Every transaction of which is onion routed.  Even between  atomic swap enabled chains.

Disjointed statements that have nothing to do with securities.  Are you trying to be deliberately ignorant?  Looks it. 


So cash may be used as payment for a security.  A crypto may be used as payment for a security.   Same thing.  It doesn't make the payment instruments a security.   What he's saying is that if you offer an ico, you could be selling a security, even if you only accept crypto.  You don't have to only accept $ to qualify as one.  A very important thing to have spelled out if you're offering an ico wouldn't you think?

No doubt that it is a complex subject.  I certainly didn't understand as much as I do now, and even after a couple of years.  If the guy who responded to me was actually interested in the answer, he would have formed it as a question.  He didn't.  He wasn't interested.  He is part of the narrative that states that miners control bitcoin.  Mainly they're just silly angry little boys.  They think they're in a club.  Maybe even... &lt;gasp!&gt;... a 'gang'.
The good thing is that it doesn't matter.  It only really matters what the node owners think, and what consensus rules the node owners apply to their transactions.  As long as that number keeps on increasing, which is possible because of the resistance of block size increases, bitcoin gets stronger and stronger.  Their ignorance is no match for consensus.  The only thing their ignorance has done is highlight to the people who *are* capable of understanding the importance of running a node, to actually learn how consensus works, and to do so.

Actually, it's important to understand the effect of the centralization of miners.  A stealthy 51% attack would allow miners to censor transactions to ensure they never appear on the blockchain.  Transactions, for example, from specific addresses.

I don't even think about it.  Every couple of weeks I put a couple of hundred on my bitcoin debit card, and I use it to pay for my beers.  So I buy at every position.
It's been doing well.  I'm sure there are times when it won't.   I've already bought more stuff of the thing than I ever put into it, and there is still more cash on it than I ever put onto it.  So even if (when) it goes down, I still won't have lost money.  If it keeps going up, as I expect it to do over the longer-term, bonza.

The problem is that any solution banks come up with requires an ability to override it.  Crypto that can be overridden isn't crypto, because if math doesn't define use, then it is just a digital token.  Bitcoin without distributed consensus and independent incentivized miners is just an inefficient redundant database.

I think you're right about the concept.  Think it from the perspective of the vampire squid : goldman sachs.  What happens when that beast enters the market?   You reckon they are gonna be on your side?  If they can think of a way to fuck it to their advantage, they're gonna try it.  And i don't mean that in a negative way.  They are who they are.

The quotes demonstrate perfectly your unintentional labeling of a thing you don't understand so that you can box it into something you think you do.

True, if there are no people, bitcoin wouldn't have value.  I suppose if matter didn't exist, and the universe didn't exist, bitcoin wouldn't have value either.  And energy!  Can't forget energy.  Bitcoin wouldn't have value if energy didn't exist.

With a soft-fork, it won't really matter?  I understand that a hard-fork is an issue, but even today people are still using v0.8 nodes.   As long as it is a change that people are willing to adopt (by upgrading their nodes), and it is backwards compatible, it can be put into the core build using the regular BIP process, and then just set a flag-day activation for 12 months in the future.  The only thing you won't be able to do is do it quickly.  In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter though.

He said no such thing. 


His statement is essentially saying it doesn't matter what you say, it is how it is used, but more importantly how it was 'released'.  Selling something on the expectation of it having value is the textbook definition of a security.  That is almost all ICO's that i can see.  There are only a few that don't.

@_date: 2017-12-03 04:22:40
I'd just suggest that as soon as its value = 200, you move it off onto a wallet you control.  That is the entire reason for bitcoins existence : the control of your private keys.
If you want to test out how it all works, you can buy $5 worth of litecoin, and download the open source electrum-ltc wallet.  Electrum for bitcoin, and electrum-ltc, are both forks of the same open-source product.  The interfaces are very similar, so you can learn how to manage keys and seeds, sending coins back and forth, until you are familiar.  Fees for ltc are vanishingly small.
Learn now, so when you're ready to shift btc to your wallet you'll know how to do it all.  Just make sure you don't send the coins to the wrong coin address!  Backup your seeds.  Delete your wallets.  Reinstate your wallets from your seeds.  Store your seeds off site somewhere secure.  These are the things you need to learn if you want to use bitcoin safely.

Yes it does.  Because the desire for money will always remain, and the value of bitcoin will increase in value relative to its inflationary alternative.  By design.  There is no deflationary asset class even on the same planet, let alone the same ball-park as bitcoin.  I know this because I know how bitcoin works.


You're stuck in an inflationary mind-set.  I totally believe in investing in companies that produce things.  They offer goods or services for a greater value than the inputs.  They create value.  But that's not saving, that's investing.
This is a [1:10000 rule]( argument for me.  I think bitcoin will finally separate the good debt from the bad debt. It is my personal belief ( as in i don't know of any formal theory ) that debt should only be incurred for the use of building a productive asset. In a deflationary currency, this encourages businesses to ensure that productivity increases will have greater returns than savings. Instead, our financial system has encouraged the acquisition of debt for fixed assets. The only thing this has done is bid up the price of those fixed debts with debt, and handed over the money for supporting that system to banks and their owners. In order to stimulate growth in such a system, the only way that you can function is to tax savings. That's what inflation is.  What it forces people to do is to invest in increasingly risky assets, because of the loss of their purchasing power.  Hence bubble after bubble after bubble.  Crisis after crisis after crisis.
Bitcoin will eventually stabilize to an ever appreciating value asset. But what it will allow you to do is save for a house. If you have a business proposal that encourages people to pay you for a good or service, people will invest their savings in it and take on that risk.  Banks will instead move back to providing capital to businesses, using savings from people that are willing to invest.  Businesses will again focus on productivity increases, because that's how you get access to capital.
I also don't think it is going to be resisted quite as much as people think it will be. People still need to pay their taxes, and that is not going to stop. The main thing it is going to do is prick the bubble of consumer debt, and remove the banking middle-men from that space. That alone is a multi-trillion dollar industry, let alone the annuities that banks own and graft from, from those assets. Removing these people (i.e. banking debt suppliers) from positions of power, by strangling their access to capital, is a justification for bitcoin in its own right. Imagine a world in which banks didn't control governments. 
That's the way it is supposed to work i think.  It is pure genius.

Completely incorrect.  Bitcoin node use for recording transactions, for whatever purpose, define its decentralization. 
You're just a person that has a use case that the decentralized nodes of bitcoin are not interested in implementing if it reduces security.  If and when people want that use case, it will happen via layers on top of the protocol.  At present, the jury is still out on that requirement.  Technologies like paywave are far more suited to that use case, and a bitcoin debit card already does it.

There is a difference, in that framework, between investment and usury.  Investment is you have skin in the game.  If the investment fails you, as the provider of capital, lose as well.

 The number one rule of bitcoin is never store your bitcoin on an exchange.

Because of the amount of nodes that bitcoin has.  And more important than number, is the nodes that are *used* to make transactions on the blockchain.  In order to replace it, the node owners must discontinue the use of their nodes and utilize an alternate one.  What you have stated demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of what makes bitcoin valuable, and what separates it from all other competitors. Bitcoin node decentralization is what keeps it censorship resistant, and in the case of bitcoin, it is ahead of any and all competitors. It likely has more fully validating nodes than all other cryptos combined, and by some margin.
There are a lot of people that want to sell you on a great new thing. Until they can get 150,000+ fully validating nodes to support their technology, they will be nothing more than a mildly distributed inefficient database.  In order to replace bitcoin, every one of those node owners needs to discontinue the use of their nodes.  What is innovative about bitcoin is that it is the only real cryptocurrency, because it is the only one that isn't controlled directly by its creators, and also maintains its decentralization. The only ones that are even close are ethereum and litecoin, and ethereum is beholden to a single person who dictates changes to the network. Litecoin is simply a clone of bitcoin with minor changes to its implementation, but has a fraction of the fully validating nodes, and therefore a fraction of the security.

It's important to remember that LN channels are bitcoin transactions.  You open a $50 LN channel one day, and a year or so later that channel might be worth $100 or $200.  You continue using it.  When you want to 'buy bitcoin' you go to an exchange, and your channel is re-filled through a LN transaction.  So no fees, but still in bitcoin.  It's easier to think of lightning as a 'freeing up' of bitcoin for instant transactions.  As soon as you want to lock it down, you can.
There are routing micro-fees envisaged, but I wouldn't be counting on them.  In the beginning, as it is being bootstrapped, I expect those fees to be low to non-existent.

Not for fixed-assets.  It only works for fixed assets in an inflationary currency.  Fixed assets should decrease in price from the time they're created, because they lose value as time progresses.  Like driving a car off of a car lot.  It is only because of inflation, and debt acquisition, that they have gone up in value in our financial system.  A bubble if you will.  
Bitcoin is the reckoning for that bubble.

With my savings in bitcoin, I now think this way.  It is very easy  with a bitcoin debit card.  
I buy a beer.  The fiat wallet has AUD$X on it. 5-15 minutes later, my bitcoin account is subtracted with the amount of bitcoin at that time. My debit card now has AUD$X again. Rinse repeat. Since i put that money into bitcoin, a few months ago, it is double the value.
So the beer was AUD$5, but i paid for it two months ago, and therefore i paid AUD$2.50.

I see a bunch of people entering a reddit tipping channel.  They want to put USD$5 in bitcoin to be able to make tips.  20 at a time using a lightning channel factory, therefore it takes 5% of a transaction cost.  Schnorr signatures and all.  You paid 1.3c to create your channel, and you have 20 open channels with every other participant.
Then, over the space a couple of years, bitcoin is now 10x the price.  That $5 is now $50.  But you have spent all of your cash... aww...
But.  You can get your permanently open lightning channel refilled, through another lightning channel.  No on-chain transaction.  So now you can spend money anywhere.  Get money to spend anywhere.  Give a guy some dosh (or another crypto for instance), and your channel between you and any one of the 20 participants can fund your channel again.  Bitcoin goes up in value, money in your channel goes up in value.
All because you had a lightning channel.  I'm going to make lots of them.  It is pure genius.

I think that is a very considered and wide ranging statement. The proof is in the pudding though. He looks like he has called out some ICO's, but until enforcement proceedings start, it is still not clear. I can't see how any pre-mined ICO, like ripple, wouldn't be treated like a security given those statements.
As a long time crypto investor, even i recognise that ico's are out of control. It is my opinion that if you can't mine it yourself, or get someone independent from the issuer to do it for you, it's a security in everything but name. Any presale token is simply a security towards the coins once released. I can't see how that isn't a security.

@_date: 2017-12-04 02:08:14


Yes it is.  


You clearly don't understand the basics.  Henceforth be thy lesson : 
So let's talk about nodes and consensus as defined in the whitepaper and implemented in nodes.
 Let's start with [the bitcoin white paper]( :


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




What does this mean if you are but an intrepid traveler amongst the erstwhile numpty-folk?
Nodes are agents in a multi-agent system with [an agreed set of consensus rules]( which they and they alone enforce, that ensure that the system functions. Transactions are propagated through the multi-agent network based upon the agreed consensus rules by nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Miners retrieve valid transactions from any of these nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then order the transactions, and perform a hashing function on them until the hashing function returns a value that is suitable to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then pass the new block that they've created to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. The nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, then validate the block to ensure that each of the transactions within the block agree with the consensus rules. Then the node, which is an agent in a multi-agent system, extends the block-chain by attaching the new block to it, and rewards the miner for the hashing work they have undertaken.  They then pass the new block, if it is valid, to other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Then each of these other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, each do the same validation on every block.
Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node extends the blockchain, and rewards the miner in bitcoin for the block they have created.  The reward is the sum of the transaction fees of the transactions in the block, and any mining reward.   The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.  It is the validation of the nodes, and their CPU's, that define and police consensus in bitcoin.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.  Miners work.  Nodes validate.  So nodes are the proof in proof-of-work. 
Nodes accept the transactions, validate the transactions (using their CPU), replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks (using their CPU), extend the blockchain (using their CPU), replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.  If you can't convince these node owners that are using their node on a day-to-day basis, to uninstall their node software and install your new node client, especially when that node client decreases their node security and decreases the network security, any change you have is going to go exactly nowhere.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.  If you can't convince all of those node owners running their node clients to uninstall one client and re-install another, any change you have to consensus is DOA.
See for yourself.  [Download it.](  It's currently at 0.15.1

 Yes.  Of course right.  Thanks for clarifying.

Now imagine your envelope is the equivalent of a mobile and private Fort Knox where you have the only key.


To understand that, one has to understand why you use this system to the exclusion of others.  And for that you need to understand the incentive structure.


Au contraire dear sir!  
To talk about the incentive structure that keeps it functioning, one must understand what that incentive structure is, and who is actually paying the incentives.   Because THAT is the stuff of pure genius.  And I'm not talking "oh he's a smart guy 'n all" I'm talking about one of the greatest inventions of all time.  So I have another [1:10000 rule]( argument for that one.  
This is actually a game theory problem. There are three groups in bitcoin. The users, the holders, and the miners. To understand the way that relationship works, you have to understand what keeps everyone separated and honest. That requires an understanding of the incentives of bitcoin, and that requires understanding what [proof-of-work]( is.
Proof-of-work aligns consensus with the users, because it is the users that are paying the miners through transaction fees. Even holders require users, and more importantly, node owners. Therefore, it is users that are incentivizing the miners. [Proof-of-stake]( aligns consensus with the holders, who are paying the miners. That is an incentive structure that reflects our current financial system. But bitcoin changes this through incentive structures and cryptography. In bitcoin, it is the incentive of the payers, not the paid, that imo is the wild invention of satoshi, and enacted through cryptography.
PoS fails because there is only one outcome given that incentive structure. Holders being miners, and then controlling the users. PoW overcomes this because the outcome is the constant tension between all three.
At the heart of the solution is what was previously thought to be the unsolvable [byzantine generals problem.]( It is a variation on the two generals problem.  The problem is "if you are a number of generals surrounding a castle, how do you coordinate an attack date and ensure that the message to attack is correctly received, when you know that the message may be altered along the way?". There's game theory around what is possible, but that's the gist of it.  In the problem, a bad actor can game the system so that everyone loses.  I have reduced it to three. Given you know one is a traitor, how do you deliver the message to attack?
The way that this is managed is that miners order the transactions, and race to hash them to an algorithm (the work in proof-of-work), which is in bitcoin, SHA-256, until they get an answer that will be accepted by the nodes (proof). They are incentivized to become more and more efficient, and spend more resources as the price increases. The nodes provide the proof in proof-of-work. They say "this block is valid", and all nodes that follow consensus will come to the same agreement.  For that work, the nodes award miners bitcoin. The nodes can prove which miner spent more work, but it sometimes takes a few blocks to get it right, which is why you have to wait for a few confirmations.
The only real thing that miners can threaten to do is stop users (the people paying them) from receiving blocks. Users and holders, after all, control their own cryptographic proofs to the tokens. But the current miners are only miners of SHA-256 pow algorithm blocks. In an adversarial condition, the miners will have just stopped coming to the party, so the users say 'fuck this' and change the pow. They get a new set of miners, mining a new algorithm, and the holders go 'holy shit, do I wanna spend my cash with a bunch of numpties that couldn't behave themselves?'. And they start spending their cash on the chain that the users say is the real one, and everyone just goes about their business again. Old miners get crushed. New miners think happy days. If the nodes change their software, that's the end of the story. Because the nodes define the consensus, they can. The remaining node owners get to decide whether they want to be owned by the miners, or whether they actually want to still remain users. The holders decide whether they are more likely to be able to realize their money with the miners that now control a drastically centralized subset of nodes, or to continue on in the system that led to them being holders in the first place.
Users can't attack the system, because then they would become holders, and users would no longer trust them for the reasons already stated, and they don't hold the cryptographic proofs of the holders. If the holders do that, they lose all of their users, so the only thing they game-theory-wise would do, would be to instate a pow. Why would anyone prefer a system in which the people with the money have all of the power? Otherwise known as the world financial system.  
Whoever attacks loses, and there's no real way to cheat the system. That's the brilliant solution to the byzantine generals problem. It is a self-sustaining financial system that rewards everyone for participating in it, where incentives are perfectly aligned for its longevity, with an ever reducing supply of tokens that are effectively infinitely divisible, increasing their value per-capita. And no, there isn't any other system in the world that shares these properties.  Without these properties, the byzantine generals problem can't be solved, and decentralization can't be achieved.  It is a fiendishly clever system, akin to an anti-body to debt-fueled inflation.
Like I said, SN was/is/will be a genius.


I have seen this decline.  80% over a year (Dec/13 to Jan/15).  The outcome you envisage did not materialize.  The only thing it disincentivizes is mining until the equilibrium is again found.  Because the nodes control consensus in bitcoin, it matters quite little what miners think.  There will always be miners for a price.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:27:50
Ah the whole bitcoin separating from blockchain meme.  Without a decentralized node infrastructure, and independent incentivized miners, blockchains are simply an inefficient redundant database.  You either accept that the two are inseparable, or you don't know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2015-12-19 13:33:46
Yep.  It took about six weeks.  As soon as I found out they weren't going to let me extract my money without me providing bank account details, I told them point-blank, I wanted the return of my money immediately.  They then proceeded to tell me how much of a reputable company they are, so I shouldn't be concerned by sending them my bank account details.  No joke, this actually happened.
I documented the entire thing, and when it started stretching beyond the times they said they were going to respond by, I threatened them with reporting them to Victorian Consumer Affairs (an australian state-based consumer protection body).  That's when they finally reversed the eftpos payment itself.  And that, the reversing of the payment, rang all of the alarm bells you can possibly ring that that place is a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:21:57
I think you're trying to insert a business structure into a space that squeezes them out.  The only viable 3rd party service i can see would be ones that take out the complexity of channel creation, or reduce the cost of channel creation/disposal.   The proposal that aggregates channel creation into signature aggregated commits is an example.   I have $50  in bitcoin that i want to fund a channel with.  Starbucks uses acme channel aggregation inc, and when you commit the $50, acme aggregates 20 or so people into a single commit, reducing the price by 90% and they pocket the extra 5% for the service.

With only about four months, already over 50% of nodes signal segwit.  With enough of a lead-time (discussed in the article) that number will be much higher.  18 months should do it.  If miners see it as the eventuality it is, they'll probably just signal segwit anyway.
It is no different than a 95% activation rate of miners.  So it's not 'very easily' is it?  In fact, no more so than the current segwit softfork proposal?

@_date: 2017-02-15 01:45:54
I don't think you understand how tor works.  The only thing one node knows about the next node is where to send the data.  At each node of traffic, the package is housed within an encrypted shell.  The exit nodes have no more understanding of where in the TOR network traffic came from than any other node.  It would take sustained traffic (like a video stream?) AND control of a significant number of exit nodes AND control of an overwhelmingly significant number of traffic nodes in order to determine where traffic went.  Even then, you wouldn't be able to find out what was said.  Exit nodes can track where traffic goes after it gets off of the TOR network, as it is simple TCP/IP traffic.  But once it goes into the TOR network, where it goes requires the above infrastructure to track.
The way almost all people get caught with TOR is because of add-ons like javascript.  If you don't enable these types of protocols, TOR is virtually impossible to hack.  If you have an insecure webserver, TOR doesn't make it secure of course.  It does, however, mean it's virtually impossible to track the person who is trying to hack you.

Upload bandwidth of nodes hasn't improved sufficiently to be able to handle a large increase in block size. 
Segwit is a block size increase as well as a capability increase, a number of scalability bug fixes, and a further scalability solution on top of it.  The fact that miners like viabtc don't signal it, means they are not interested in scalability at all.

I'm not sure.  In this hypothetical environment, miners are free to accept whatever txns they want.  If they don't want to accept segwit txns, so-be-it.  What miners can't do, is add invalid blocks, and the nodes are the ones that decide the validity of both blocks and transactions.  So, from a miners perspective, they get a pool of txns if they don't want to accept segwit txns, and they get a larger pool of txns if they do, but there's nothing to do with a fork there.

You cannot pass comment on a technical solution without understanding the constraints of that technical solution.


The alternative is the status-quo.  The market has overwhelmingly adopted segwit, with the functioning nodes already over 60%.  A proportion of miners want to take control of bitcoin, but they don't speak for the market.  If they were ever silly enough to cause a fork with code that is demonstrably unsafe, they'd quickly find out where the actual market is, and they'd find out that their assets worth millions of dollars are stranded.  Even the miners that haven't signalled segwit yet know this.

Dude, no one cares about bu blocks.  They will be rejected because they don't obey consensus rules if they go above 1mb.  Segwit doesn't even do that.  Uasf doesn't change that.  Uasf is about users overriding miners.  Users don't want bu.  it is not going to be activated because both the users and the miners reject it. Segwit blocks are what people want, and that is reflected in the speed at which core 0.13 has been implemented.  As long as those nodes accept segwit blocks and transactions, they will, by definition, have consensus. 
Uasf and bu are not really related at all.

@_date: 2017-02-12 03:09:02
That's a faulty analysis.  To calcuate the true 'cost of bitcoin' one would have to calculate the total cost of energy for all mining, add the cost of the facilities for mining, add the cost of maintenance, and finally add the amortized cost of the hardware for mining.  It's that value, divided by the amount of transactions per block, that define the cost of a transaction.
It's a large value, and getting larger.  The current txn mining fees for a txn is about 7-8% of the block reward on average.  With a standard cost of about 20c per txn (ballpark) that value would need to be about $2.50 to account for the entire block reward.  
But the energy for hashing is increasing, not decreasing.  Segwit would decrease the short-term cost per txn, but the reality is, mining costs money, and the payment for that mining isn't some far-off expense many years down the track.  It's now, and increasing.  It's unlikely that the block reward is paying for mining.  Miners are primarily relying upon the increase in value of bitcoin to justify the expense.
The quadratic hashing bug in non-segwit implementations makes it even worse if the block size is increased.  The only thing that would happen is that mining would get more expensive, and therefore, transaction costs would increase, regardless of how many more of them there were.

What I said in [the other thread]( :
Interesting proposal.
I think I remember a core dev alluding to this proposal. Isn't this a way of exerting control over miners without changing a POW? The way I read this proposal is that nodes decide what makes a valid txn, whether that is a segwit enabled txn, or a traditional one. Miners can decide what txns they want to include in their blocks, so long as they're valid txns as defined by the nodes.
What miners can't do is create invalid transactions, nor create a non-valid block of transactions, and add them to the block-chain, because they will be rejected by nodes. As happened recently by BU.
So miners decide which class of transactions are included in a block, but there will be an incentive for miners to adopt segwit enabled txns, because there'll one, be more of them, and two, it will allow segwit/lightning so there will be less of a concern for users to have 'quick transactions' on the blockchain, because they'll get instant transactions in lightning. If Bitmain continues to want to never upgrade to segwit, so-be-it. They can continue doing their thing.
Segwit activation with no fork, and opt-in by users, nodes, and miners. As long as the node activation time is set long enough (18 months?) you know there's plenty of time to update the nodes, and seeing as they've already gone past 50%, that shouldn't present too much of an issue. You don't even have to worry about McNodes, because they generally don't accept transactions, so don't really have any say in the health of the network.
So there could essentially be two methods of activating segwit. The easy way, miners, do your thang. But if you're not going to do your thang, it'll happen anyway, it'll just take a bit longer.

Just a quick point out here... No it doesn't.  Segwit is a blocksize increase that increases the requirements of nodes.  If it didn't provide those fantastic benefits (malleability fix, quadratic hashing bug fix), I wouldn't want it either.  But that's not what we were talking about.
As for the second part that I'm not sure you read, if you were add the functionality of extension blocks (which is what I specifically referred to) you would increase the node requirements further.  If you were to adopt BU, it would increase it yet again (and worse), for the same reason. And that's what I was talking about.

Incorrect.  The first is the nodes.  That is where the economic support comes from.  Without people using nodes, miners get empty blocks.
Miners will be able to decide which transactions they mine.  If they choose not to include segwit transactions in the blocks they mine, that is their prerogative, and it always has been.  It's the only power they should have.  That is the only power they will have.

@_date: 2017-02-26 07:42:11


It's very easy to do it now.   A miner can create a chain-split at any time by attaching an invalid block, and building on top of that chain.  What nodes do, is not propagate the chain from that miner, because it contains an invalid block.  So no different than now.  That's how it is controlled now.  By the nodes.  Nothing changes.
As long as enough nodes that accept transactions have this proposal enabled (which is not the same as node count) users, nodes, and miners, will be unaffected.  So no different than now.  Put a long enough lead-time onto it, and it's pretty straight-forward.  
Unless, of course, people don't actually want these features, and run a node that accepts transactions.  And that, yet again, is their choice.  It's always a possibility, but not very likely.  Over 50% of nodes that signal segwit have been updated in the past four months.  Give it an 18 month lead-time, and everyone is happy.  Users, nodes, and miners.

You can actually spend the outputs before they're confirmed if your wallet supports it.  If you put in an appropriate fee, it will confirm the previous transaction as well.  It's called Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP).

So when the new node software comes out, you know, [the one that allows for them to create segwit txns that are mined by segwit miners]( and yet still obey the bitcoin consensus rules... lol... it's gonna be even faster.

No not austrian.  I actually think the 'hear here!' is an extension of the town crier ["hear ye! hear ye!"]( and english being what it is, morphed into "hear him!  hear him!" and further morphed into 'hear here'.  It wouldn't surprise me if both of them spawned from the same town crier etymology.  [Hear]( and [here]( actually spawned out of the same etymology from about the 1200's from proto-germanic origins.

The conspiracy theorists become increasingly marginalized as the education of the regular non-conspiracy people increases.  That's what's happening.  It's slow when there are a lot of non-technical people (like yourself) that argue from positions of ignorance, but that is thankfully starting to reduce.
The reality is that virtually all technical people agree that segwit is a good solution that increases transaction count and fixes many protocol issues.  If you are on the other side of that (which BU proponents generally are) than you're essentially on the opposite side of the technical experts.  There are lots of reasons why that is the case, including a number of bad actors, but it doesn't change the relationship.

Hey the only thing i would add to that would be the counter to the argument "what if you can't complete the block chain commit because the fees are too high?"
If the fees are high, with CPFP you can pay more to get money back.   Why would you do this?   Because if the fee was so high, the value coming back would be worth more too.  It hasn't gone anywhere.  If it's worth it to you to make sure you get it instead of it reverting back to the other guy, you'll do it. If bitcoin has crashed, who cares about the fee?  Who cares about the money in the channel?  If it is worth it, you'll pay the fee.

That's the point.  The users have already signaled segwit at greater than 50% in four months.  By the time it activates (18 months?), it'll be virtually everyone.
So the miners will have a choice :  
- Do it now, and get the benefits of segwit transactions.  
- Do it later, and get the benefits of segwit transactions.  
- Don't do it later, and don't get the benefit of segwit transactions.
They'll be able to continue not mining segwit transactions if they so choose.  What they won't get the opportunity to do, is to force the users not to have segwit.

I don't claim to be a core expert.  I only say what i think I understand, and am regularly corrected when I make a mistake.  An example of one of them was recently being told that a miner runs a node.  I didn't know that.
But the proposal itself, I think, is pretty clear.  There is obviously a significant amount of work behind the scenes that would be required to implement it of course.  They might even find it isn't possible.  But it sounds like it might be a very interesting solution that resolves long-term problems, while at the same time providing choice to users and miners about what they want to use bitcoin for.  More importantly, it sounds like it might be a solution to miners that use their political clout to try and modify the consensus rules for their own benefit, without having to resort to the nuclear option of a change to the POW.
@_date: 2017-02-28 03:23:54


You don't understand how bitcoin works.  It is nodes that decide who gets forked off of the network.  That is their reason for existence.  Which is why a recent BU miner was forked off, because they produced a non-consensus block.

There are many ways to take it. As umbawumpa says, the "huach her" interpretation is slightly different, and knowing the etymology that both hear and here come from the same proto-germanic origin, it's not really clear, nor understood, which one is 'correct', or if there is any correct version at all.  Which kind of makes sense, considering both words sound the same.  A common usage was "Hear ye this here!", and it was generally a spoken usage, without any formal documentation, given, you know, the reason for the crier in the first place was so that announcements could be made to people who couldn't read.  The parliament version you referred to was documented centuries after its use started.  In english dictionaries it is generally accepted to mean 'hear hear', but like I said, when you go back further into the origin of the phrase, it's not really clear.  I remember reading an english scholar wonk writing about it once, but can't find the reference anymore.  
Nor, of course, does it really matter.  I just like bringing it up from time-to-time when people are corrected on the phrase.

First things first, nodes don't mine.  But I think I know what you're trying to say.
An old node will reject the segwit transaction and not include them in a block.  Miners (and nodes) have always had the power to reject, or include, transactions that they want to.  Including invalid transactions in a block (like recently happened with a BU miner) will mean that the nodes will reject them.  As always.  Segwit miners will not reject them, and will include them in a block.  The decision about what is rejected or not is managed by the nodes.
Nodes then decide whether the block is valid.  If it contains segwit transactions, from a segwit miner, it is a valid block.  If it contains non-segwit transactions, and it is from a non-segwit miner, it is a valid block.  Miners don't care about the previous block.  The only thing they care about is whether the last block was marked as validated.  So non-segwit miners will build on the top of blocks that have segwit transactions in them.
So no chain split.
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:22:41
Don't complain here when they're all stolen then. And that is stolen by either hackers, company employees, the company itself, or the government.

Gone. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 03:04:07
It doesn't change the fact that people will be sending segwit transactions, and will be doing it towards segwit enabled nodes.  Segwit miners (and any miner really) can take those txns and put them into valid blocks that are marked as valid blocks by the nodes accepting transactions, and every other node.
So it doesn't matter how many McNodes miners create.  It matters what users want, and have the code to utilize, what nodes accept those txns and mark valid, and what miners want to mine.  As long as users use segwit, there will be an incentive in the case of more transactions, and lower cost per transaction, and more fees per block for a miner that is prepared to include segwit transactions in a block.  If you, as a miner, choose to do it the old way, there's nothing stopping you doing that either.

I'm not sure what your point is.  I'm not sure you are either.


No, and at no point has this been asserted.  It sounds to me like you're trying to get a gotcha moment when there isn't one.  Perhaps you should actually read the proposal?  That might increase your understanding.  It doesn't remove the ability for a soft-fork to be triggered by miners.  It adds another method.


Miners do run a node.  I'm not sure what you mean by 'class'.  I think you're trying to put answers into my mouth without actually stating what you're asking.

Interesting proposal.
Edit : I think I remember a core dev alluding to this proposal.  Isn't this a way of exerting control over miners without changing a POW?  The way I read this proposal is that nodes decide what makes a valid txn, whether that is a segwit enabled txn, or a traditional one.  Miners can decide what txns they want to include in their blocks, so long as they're valid txns as defined by the nodes.  
What miners can't do is create invalid transactions, nor create a non-valid block of transactions, and add them to the block-chain, because they will be rejected by nodes.  As happened recently by BU.
So miners decide which class of transactions are included in a block, but there will be an incentive for miners to adopt segwit enabled txns, because there'll one, be more of them, and two, it will allow segwit/lightning so there will be less of a concern for users to have 'quick transactions' on the blockchain, because they'll get instant transactions in lightning.  If Bitmain continues to want to never upgrade to segwit, so-be-it.  They can continue doing their thing.  
Segwit activation with no fork, and opt-in by users, nodes, and miners.  As long as the node activation time is set long enough (18 months?) you know there's plenty of time to update the nodes, and seeing as they've already gone past 50%, that shouldn't present too much of an issue.  You don't even have to worry about McNodes, because they generally don't accept transactions, so don't really have any say in the health of the network.
So there could essentially be two methods of activating segwit.  The easy way, miners, do your thang.  But if you're not going to do your thang, it'll happen anyway, it'll just take a bit longer.

Side-chains theoretically can do it, but it's true that the primary plan is for the LN to carry the load of the next significant scale-up of usage.
I suspect that that's the reason why companies like coinbase are so against the core devs right now.  The architecture of the LN is such that this will take funds out of pools they control, and put them into channels that they don't.

I'm not sure that's what you're saying.  The actual transaction size will be the same as a normal transaction.  The 'thousands' of back-and-forth iou changes are discarded, and only the aggregated change is committed to the blockchain.  This is the great thing about lightning.  It is a single transaction with as many inputs and outputs (one/two) as defined in the original transaction.  Only the transaction values change.
Consider a channel link of this : John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne.  Only the people next to each people in the chain have a 'channel open' with each other (John/Bob, Bob/Sally, Sally/Anne).  Assuming each of the channels between all of the participants have adequate funds in order to achieve this, if John wanted to send 1btc to Anne.  A transaction ledger would read :
- John-&gt;Bob channel : John -1btc, Bob +1btc
- Bob-&gt;Sally channel : Bob -1btc, Sally +1btc
- Sally-&gt;Anne channel : Sally -1btc, Anne +1btc.
Anne now has 1btc more, and John has 1btc less, but the net effect in each channel is simply a modification to the distribution of bitcoin in that channel.  
Imagine this happening, back and forth, and extended to thousands, tens of thousands, and millions of people.  As long as there's a chain between them, you use the chain.  You might even have your transaction split over multiple chains.  For links that don't have a chain, you create a channel on-the-fly.
Each channel, therefore, only ends up with the same single input, and the same two outputs, just differing values.
It's significantly more complex than that, but that's the idea.  I wish I could remember the lightning dev that explained it.  It really is very clever.
PS: I haven't actually questioned about the effect of having channels with multiple inputs (John/Sally) and outputs (Bob/Anne) at inception.  Technically, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible.  Just a much weirder set of ramifications.

I agree with that too, as it should be.  But what this proposal would do would be to allow miners to rely upon their selfishness (not a bad thing) because segwit blocks will have more transactions, and allow for more fees to be gained.  It won't allow the other miners to exert a minority block of the soft fork, and they'll continue earning less in fees as long as they continue mining non segwit blocks.  Which is totally up to them.

bah humbug.  He's talking about different things, as are you.  Having an alt-coin pegged through a side-chain to bitcoin means you can run alternate infrastructure and rules for validation.  
Yes, it will have a lot of the same issues, but there's no guarantee that a side-chain will have the exact same ones.  He knows that more than anyone I would imagine.  Yes, it will have increased risk issues.  But will you be able to have more transactions?  Yes, because transactions will potentially be happening off-chain.  Personally, I don't like it, for lots of different reasons.  But that's not the point.  I will take one exception though... there's no guarantee that a side-chain will have the same validation mechanism.  They could have a validation mechanism that says you can spend someone elses coins if you can prove that your name starts with 'W' for all you and I know.

BU blocks are rejected because they break consensus rules if they create a block greater than 1MB.  If they don't, they don't get rejected.  Segwit blocks won't break consensus rules, so they won't get rejected.   
It's a fiendishly clever proposal.  It clearly spells out to the miners that they are not in charge, and that they are given permission to create blocks, so long as the bitcoin users, through the nodes, manage the consensus rules.  If they choose to only mine non-segwit blocks, they are welcome to.  No-one is going to stop them, and no-one is going to force them.  What miners can't do, is decide which consensus rules bitcoin must apply to transactions and blocks.
@_date: 2017-02-28 04:38:14
And again, you completely don't understand the mechanism under which that is not the case, and why this is such a great proposal.  The fear of a fork has been used as a justification for not adopting changes that users overwhelmingly want, because miners want to control bitcoin, even when the function has nothing to do with mining.   This removes the potency of that threat.  That is exactly what makes it so great.

Bitcoin is a deflationary currency.   That means, by design, the value of an individual bitcoin relative to an inflationary currency like the US dollar (or any dollar really) will increase over time. 
The fact that it is recognized as having that quality, means more people want to acquire the asset, which further inflates its value.  
Its ability to easily transfer across borders and be converted to fiat currencies provides a utility that makes it sought after, and there is effectively no-one that can stop you transferring what you own to where you want it.

Definitely not.  The crypto relationship is between your channel and the other channel.  Your transaction signs an expenditure that is provably yours, and that is stored in the other persons channel.  They acknowledge receipt of that transaction, and provably sign in yours.  That's why channels must be open between buyer and seller for any transaction to occur.


How the channels are opened, and their relationship to the hub is still unclear.  After the transaction detailed above, I imagine a hash is taken of each channel, and that is also stored in the opposing channel.  I imagine that is also stored on a hub, but I'm not sure it is a requirement.
The real clever stuff happens when there are three channels that are open.  I buy something from Bob for 1mBtc.  Bob buys something from Anne for 1mBtc.  So Bob owes Anne 1mBtc, and I owe Bob 1mBtc, and these transactions are recorded in each of our channels.  Now let's assume Anne wants to buy something from me for 1mBtc.  The actual transfer happens between Bob and Anne, where my debt with Bob is extinguished, Bob's debt to Anne is extinguished, all because Anne paid my channel.  End result?  No block-chain commit required.
Great stuff.

And anyone with bitcoin will be able to create a channel, and do it on the fly. If you use a standard txn, i would expect the merchant to force you to wait until a txn has confirmed. The average time between blocks is ~10 minutes.  Thats not likely to change any time soon, or, you know... ever.

@_date: 2017-02-28 05:26:31
For the record, I'm talking about the miner/node combination sometimes, just the miner node sometimes, and  just the miner sometimes.  I should make that clearer.   


I think that makes it even less likely of a fork occuring, yes?  It would take nodes transferring on invalid segwit transactions, which, given enough time, with enough nodes that are validating segwit transactions, would be less likely to occur.  Unless, of course, a miner chooses to open themselves up to this type of attack vector.  Which is kind of similar to what happened with the BU fork the other day.


Which is no different than BU inserting a &gt;1mb block, which is (and was) rejected by the nodes.  As long as enough nodes are validating for segwit transactions, this is the same, yes?  I mean, if 20% of the miner/nodes decided to just start pushing &gt;1mb blocks, they'd fork, for the same reason.  They've always had this option.


Which old nodes will do with blocks filled with segwit transactions, yes?


At a non-validation level like this, it doesn't matter.  Whether the previous block was filled with segwit transactions, or not, the non segwit miner/node will not care how they got there.
PS : But thanks for clarification on old nodes acceptance of segwit txns.  Wasn't sure of the mechanism of that.

And that's predominantly upload, not download either.  And you numpties want to let miners set those values starting about eight times that, and work up from there?
Fkn morons.

@_date: 2017-02-13 07:07:05


Oh ffs.


Literally the first fucking sentence.
But it does allow me to continue pressing the important point.  Never store your bitcoin on an exchange.  Coinbase is an exchange.  If they get hacked, you lose your bitcoin.  If they decide to steal it, you lose your bitcoin.  If a malicious employee decides to redirect your bitcoin to themselves, you lose your bitcoin.  If the government freezes their assets, you lose your bitcoin.  If the government decides to make bitcoin ownership illegal, you lose your bitcoin.  Never store your bitcoin on an exchange.  It is literally the number one rule of bitcoin.

Unlike you, I don't make shit up.  He could have put it in because he recognized the stress it would put on nodes when blocks start getting full.  Either way, he didn't remove it, and that was after a lot of people wanted him to.  Seems as logical a reason as any I'd say.  And now you want to go against 'satoshis vision' or something?  I thought you guys thought that that was a bad thing?
Now that we've gotten that cleared up, perhaps it might be best if you entered discussions about subjects without making shit up in order to justify something?

I've been wrong plenty of times. But there's a difference between being wrong, and being wrong and not identifying where you were. Ridicule is the only tactic I've ever seen that works. 
But the way i feel?  This struggle is bitcoin.  It's inability to change is its strength. If it is successful, imagine the obfuscation that a state actor could achieve. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 10:47:33
The two aren't related.   You contribute to the pool if you have a node and miners will take transactions from you like they will from any other node.  If a node decides to restrict a type of txn, or even a minimum mining fee, it's their call.  It's why you need more nodes.  To stop malicious nodes from controlling the network.

No they aren't.  Fees have been lower than credit cards since bitcoin was created, and the fact is, retail take-up is the same, or less, than it was two years ago.


Exactly.  More importantly, transaction fees are going up.  Which shows that more and more people are willing to pay more and more for the decentralized store of value that bitcoin offers.

Who brought up POW?  Nothing is changing that.  No-one uses those McNodes to validate transactions, do they?  So they can spawn as many McNodes as they like, because it doesn't affect the users using their clients to access nodes that accept their transactions, validate the transactions, and allow for miners to source their transactions for inclusion in blocks from them.  That's why the BU and Classic McNodes attack fizzled out, and disappeared.  They were only numbers in a list, and no-one actually used them for anything except a list that they could point at and cheer about.
Node count is immaterial.  Nodes that accept transactions that will be validated by other nodes and be accessible by miners that will include them in blocks (using POW), is what matters.
So you haven't really provided any justification for the belief that it will lead to a chain split, have you?

I don't think it's a bu thing but a miner thing, but think it's an important debate.  Dealing with miners like they are now is nothing compared to what would happen if a state actor did the same things.  It's important to have this 'resolved' now.  Bitcoin is tiny now, but might not be one day.  One day there might be actors that are far far more sophisticated. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 05:44:08


Way more than that dude.  It is regularly noted that the upload bandwidth requirement of bitcoin is 100's of gb per month.  The best case-scenario of running a node with a 1mb block size is [0.373Mbps upload bandwidth required]( which equates to 1.4TB per year, or roughly 100GB per month.  Most nodes have multiples above this.  
A 20mb block would have 28TB a year upload at an absolute minimum, or over 2TB per month upload.

Except it isn't.  One new spam attack, and the exact problem appears again, and there's a new cry from even more users crying 'increase the block size now!!!  the sky is falling!'
The solution is to fix the problem now, and not introduce new problems like increased centralization pressures and the massive risk of introducing new problems because of a hard-fork.
The two largest concern-trolls are the coinbase business leader (BArmstrong), and one of his advisors (GAndresen).  This is after the whiny rage-quit of Hearn, who actually wanted to introduce a tor-based black-list to the protocol that he controlled.  These representatives of corporations are interested in one thing and one thing alone.  Lining their pockets, and the pockets of their share-holders.  They have no interest in decentralization as they have proven time and again, and are only interested in taking control of it.
And you know what?  They aren't going to get their way, so you might as well integrate that, and build a bridge.  Until such a time as there are better technical representatives that don't directly represent corporate interests, I'll continue to support the technical representatives that have repeatedly shown that they will make the best decision for the protocol, regardless of the repeated well-funded attempts of organizations to discredit them, especially through the media.

No they don't.  They just won't be able to include segwit transactions in their block.  They'll think they're invalid transactions, so their node won't allow them into their pool, and therefore the miner won't include them.

I'm not sure I disagree with a single thing you said there.  I wasn't referring to miners in the technical sense, but in the political sense.  I completely agree that the current requirement of even discussing this issue with miners is suboptimal.  They're not served by it, and bitcoin isn't served by it.
The reality is, however, that right now miners as a group are exerting power.  This proposal would seem to be a method of putting a check on that.  I actually think it's good for miners in the long run too.

Because the fee you placed on the transaction was 1/3 of what it needs to be.  
Only you can decide if the 20c saved was worth the wait for a miner to include your txn in a block.
@_date: 2017-02-21 03:14:13
No.  A transaction input and output have roughly a set value.  If you have one input and two outputs (a typical bitcoin transaction) that will be roughly 200bytes.  The value is irrelevant.  If you have five inputs, and three outputs, the transaction size is larger, so requires a higher fee to be included in a block.

Blocks are generated, on average, every 10 minutes.  At no point has this ever been different. 
Use a real wallet.  Then you have control of your bitcoin.  If you choose to rely on a 3rd party for creating bitcoin transactions, like coinbase, the people you should be taking it up with is that 3rd party supplier. 
Which, to put it quite bluntly, you should never do. It is only stated every single day on this subreddit for years.  Do not store your bitcoin on an exchange.  Never.   Never ever ever.

No-one is getting forked off of the network.  That's the point.  Nodes decide what transactions are valid, and nodes decide what blocks are valid.
Miners will be able to decide which transactions they mine. If they choose not to include segwit transactions in the blocks they mine, that is their prerogative, and it always has been. Same thing for BU.  The only problem is, BU creates blocks that are rejected by nodes, which is why BU was forked off of the network a week or so ago.  It's the only power miners should have. That is the only power they will have.  That's what [this]( proposal is all about.

I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt, and not call that a straw-man.  If DDOS protection was the only reason you needed more than one node, that might be useful.  But it isn't.  Nodes actually perform a function.  Or, more to the point, core nodes actually perform a function.
Nodes that only exist so that brain-dead script-kiddies can look at a list and yell "woohoo!  we'z da manzzzzzz!!!!" aren't really useful as a function of the protocol.  The fact that they will disappear as fast as they were spawned should be the thing that gives you pause.
@_date: 2016-03-05 01:35:26


Clearly it isn't.
I expect bitcoin transaction costs to climb to the level they pay for the miners, but it's going to take years.  If that's $1 per blockchain commit in five years time, so-be-it.  Now we have a working mechanism to allow it to do so.  With LN we get the other side of that puzzle in that we will have censorship resistance, lower fees per transaction, and for it to be truly scalable.  If you still want to use the blockchain for your transactions, you will be able to, but it'll come with an associated fee reflecting the cost.
It's almost as if some people have put a lot of thought into this.

Coinbase makes more profit when more users transfer between different coinbase users, because mining fees are not applied in those instances.  More centralization means coinbase costs reduce.  Coinbase wants to control bitcoin, and is completely uninterested in decentralization, which is why coinbase is using a media campaign (that you follow along like a lost puppy for) to attempt to wrest control of bitcoin development from the actual technical experts.

That's because if you pay an appropriate fee, there aren't any problems using bitcoin, in spite of there being an actual low-fee spam-attack on the network at that exact time.

There are people anywhere that could do that, as long as they have the associated asic's.  His point is that that tech is centralized in china, because that is where most of the chips are being fabricated.  Once that advantage has been reduced, and there's only a marginal gain to be had by quickly integrating new asic tech, you're back to energy efficiency, and that's something that china is no better than many other places at.
I'd like to see it happen, but it'll take a while before it washes out of the system.
@_date: 2016-03-06 22:42:39
The main avenue I think there is for fees is through the people that eventually do the commit to the blockchain when a channel is closed.  If a channel is open for some length of time, the transaction cost could change.  So the question is, is the transaction cost paid when the channel is opened?  Or when it is closed?
If it is paid when it is opened, the more transactions that end up fitting into the channel, the more efficient it is.  But an assumption needs to be made about how long the transaction is going to be, at the time you open it.  If it is paid when it is closed, it's good you have RBF, because if your fee is too low, you'll want to be upping this as soon as you can, so you can retrieve any unspent value within a channel.
Also, there's going to need to be some clearing-house that connects channels.  I imagine that this is going to be a service like any other that accepts a fee for connecting channels.  There's no reason to think that there wouldn't be competition on these fees, but I think that's another cost that could exist.

Doesn't it become a problem when the attack controls 75% of the nodes?  By the current count, they would need another 12,000 give or take?
I'm trying to think of how this would be an issue, but like I said, i read about these things in the past, and they didn't seem to be viewed that way previously.  In the example provided, they were viewed very negatively ~~(by coinbase no less!!)~~.  Were defense strategies put in place after that?  I wouldn't think about it too much myself if the miners were following that trend, because it really would be just a 'well dems da breaks'.  But with only 5% of mining and now over 30% of nodes, even if they aren't real ones, I just wonder where it eventually ends.

Definitely not.  BU adds a consensus breaking rule called 'emergent consensus' that allows miners to group together and force nodes and miners not connected to them off of the network.  It is a proposal for miners to take ownership of bitcoin.  Only the people who don't have the technical understanding of what it entails, and the miners wanting it of course, support it.
@_date: 2017-02-13 07:37:24
Never store your bitcoin on an exchange. Coinbase is an exchange. If they get hacked, you lose your bitcoin. If they decide to steal it, you lose your bitcoin. If a malicious employee decides to redirect your bitcoin to themselves, you lose your bitcoin. If the government freezes their assets, you lose your bitcoin. If the government decides to make bitcoin ownership illegal, you lose your bitcoin. Never store your bitcoin on an exchange. It is literally the number one rule of bitcoin.

Increased blocksize leads to increased bandwidth, which leads to a decrease in nodes, as it puts it out of the hands of a regular user running on.  A decrease in nodes leads to contentious forks becoming possible (among other things), and a hostile takeover of the network, for whatever purpose.  In in the specific case of Hearn, he wanted to introduce the ability to black-list in the XT contentious hard-fork.
So the blocksize increase leads to decreased nodes, which opens up a recognized attack vector.  Yes.  This is what classic is doing.

I'm not so sure.  Who knows if they're even accepting incoming transactions?  
The real telling thing about this is just the simple fact that it isn't people changing nodes, it is totally new nodes that have been spawned.  If it was a legitimate expansion of people using or requiring nodes, you would see a corresponding drop in the number of other nodes.  That didn't happen.
The nodes will disappear just as quickly as they came into existence, because they simply aren't being used as nodes.

Some miners talk like they think they have power.  They have one power, and that is to mine, or to not mine.  If they abuse that power, they will lose it.  I almost wish they'd do it now, so early in bitcoins life, so that there is a permanent scar on the psyche of all miners forever more, such that they will never contemplate these actions again.

I think you need to let it go.  Coinbase is doing what coinbase does, and in spite of vocal rhetoric, doesn't actually have much skin-in-the-game with regards to bitcoin protocol development.  This is the second attempted hostile take-over of bitcoin development so far this year, and it will be as successful as the last time.
When the manufactured drama dies down again, we'll still be left with the same development teams, with a slightly more robust protocol, and more tools.  It doesn't really matter what coinbase does, or who they decide to shill, because they have zero say in the direction of bitcoin.  If anything, like Hearn, their influence has diminished, because of their actions.

The fee isn't set.  It's what people are willing to pay.  What is being tested out right now is exactly that.  What the minimum fee is.  Someone is spamming very low-fee transactions to crowd out all other transactions that are lower.  There's a point where that becomes prohibitively expensive (to spam).

I'm not actually sure what you mean there.  My understanding is that there is, in fact, very little intelligence in a hub.  It is more just an aggregator and list processor.  The channel controls all purchasing.  Without the channel open, the hub can do nothing.  I do know from a developer that the hub in no way manages your, or anyone elses, bitcoin, at least for purchases.  Perhaps that might be different for fees?  Not sure.

It's not that the government 'allows' you to do something (which is what you stated) it's that the government doesn't have the right to take it away from you.  Guns are not 'legal'.

Yes it is simple.  But you still continue on without understanding, so clearly not simple enough for you.  Nodes decide whether the block is valid. If it contains segwit transactions, from a segwit miner, it is a valid block. If it contains non-segwit transactions, and it is from a non-segwit miner, it is a valid block. Miners don't care about the previous block. The only thing they care about is whether the last block was marked as valid. So non-segwit miners will build on the top of blocks that have segwit transactions in them.  This has been explained many times now.


It does not change.  Miners have always had the ability to include or not include transactions.  What do you think the ViaBTC accelerator was/is?
Miners will follow the money.  If there is a large pool of transactions that they can earn money from, when the pool they have is empty, so they earn no fees, they'll go to the pool that earns them money.

The problem with second round of early adopters, is that really they are just gamblers.  They want "INSTANT MASS ADOPTION NOW!!&gt; because they want a massive return on a small speculative investment.

More to the point, it would stop the decline of full-nodes.  There would, conceivably, be more nodes added, as the transaction volume of the LN increases.


Wouldn't it be great if this issue was resolved before it became an issue?
It does sound like you're already working on this, so am hoping it's possible that this could be thought about as an option for the integration of the LN into bitcoin nodes.  
It vaguely sounds like it would be possible to do as a soft-fork too, in that you could theoretically run a node the old way, and it would not affect the underlying bitcoin transaction methodology.  You could have LN nodes, or traditional nodes, except the LN nodes have an incentive for running them.  I think you'd find one side taking over after short period of time, but that's up to the node owner.  As long as you specify that to house a LN transaction enabler, you require a full-node, it would solve a number of the problems.

It continues to enforce consensus rules for all transactions and blocks, but has the added feature of allowing miners to create segwit blocks with segwit transactions if they want to.  The only thing the miners lose is the power to veto scalability improvements.

Yes, I understand.  Unfortunately, as is demonstrated by their reduction over time, even while transaction volume has been increasing, that that incentive doesn't seem to be enough.  With ~50K nodes, there are clearly more people running a node than there are people who would actually be using it so that they could query it directly, so most aren't doing it for anything more than altruism.
I'm hoping that there's a way that they could and would be maintained purely as a selfish exercise.  There could/should be fees, even for using the lightning network.  I imagine they will be an order of magnitude cheaper than the ultimate settlement layer of bitcoin.  I've yet to hear where those lightning network fees go, or indeed, how they are to be structured at all.  I think it would be a good incentive to house a node if the hoster could be compensated for doing so.

I think just good for the people who might today be altruistic node owners, having an incentive going forward.  And also good if you are merchant solution that wants to accept lightning transactions, but want to reduce the cost of doing so.  I don't think it's ever going to be 'cheap money'.  But if the plans for the lightning network were to be believed, and I can't see why they shouldn't, it will be able to facilitate several orders of magnitude more transactions.  Then the large block discussion becomes a bit of a moot point, because there will be ongoing incentives to ensure the hardware/infrastructure of nodes meet the requirements.

It isn't up to the network to protect miners from malicious miners, it is up to the network to protect USERS from malicious miners.  Miners already need to run bridging nodes for exactly the purpose of protecting themselves from malicious miners, because most of them probably aren't even running standard node clients.

[Shamelessly stolen from here. ](
Hey, it's not my fault that all the facts and reason are on one side of this so-called "debate", and that the other side is incapable of following the (clear and well-defined) rules of the subreddit, and in fact goes out of their way to blatantly break these rules repeatedly.
Since you have a clear ideological bias here, let's pretend that instead of promoting a contentious and malicious alternative client that could potentially fracture the Bitcoin network, instead the rule was "No spam promoting penis pills".
If someone came into the subreddit and said "BUY DICKPILLS FROM DICKPILLS.COM" over and over, and received a ban because of it, and then made an army of sockpuppet accounts to do the same thing, would you have a problem with them being banned and their posts deleted?
I'd bet not. I'd bet you'd be fine with it.
And then if someone said "Hey it turns out that penis pills have adverse side effects and can hurt you in a lot of ways", and that comment were not deleted, would you have a problem with that? I'd bet not.
So what if a sockpuppet account responded "NO UR DUMB, DICKPILLS ARE THE BEST AND ARE GOOD 4 U" and that comment was removed, would you have a problem with that? What if they were a little more subtle about it, and said "Hey everyone, the scientists who did the study about the adverse side effects of dickpills are all being paid by the banksters and so they're all in a conspiracy together. Don't believe that nonsense about health effects. Buying dickpills could be a great idea. It might be the best idea ever. Come discuss dickpills with us in the wonderful dickpill subreddit! We're trying to determine whether dickpills are healthy or not, and we keep getting C3NS0R3D in this place!"
Would you be okay with removing that spam? I know I would.
And then months later, after a dedicated and prolonged dickpill campaign (wherein it was discovered that dickpills have numerous horrible health effects, by all the reputable experts in the industry who unanimously agree on this point), you show up saying "Hey if discussion is allowed here, where are all the dickpill posts?"

Nodes define validity. If the nodes don't change, bitcoin doesn't change 
@_date: 2017-03-01 11:50:15
There are two things that are important.  There is that, and there is the overwhelming consensus of nodes that would be required that are accepting and validating segwit transactions.  If an invalid segwit txn is added, regular nodes will still think it is a valid txn, but segwit aware nodes won't.  They'll reject it.  So as long as the nodes don't propagate the invalid block, miners won't attempt to add on to it.  If it is a regular valid segwit txn, any core or segwit node will add it to a block, and build on top of it as required.  The more hashing power the better, but it lowers the threshold significantly.
@_date: 2016-03-10 06:38:41

That's not how the LN works.  Coinbase is currently hoping that the small transactions get done between coinbase buyers/sellers, because then they charge transfer fees, but don't have to include blockchain commits.  The more people who use their system, the easier it is for them to do this.
The LN locks bitcoin into a 'channel' until it is closed, and the entire commit is done at once.  That doesn't leave room for the coinbase middle-man.
The LN needed SegWit, and it's telling that classic hasn't included it.  In april LN instances will have an environment that allows it to exist.  Armstrong seems to be trying to curtail this.

I'm not talking about now. I'm talking about what we, the users, actually want.  We, the users, can adopt other consensus rules if we want.  No one can force us to do anything.  So the question is, what do we want, and how do we, or even should we, bring along the elements that might have good reasons for not adopting the changes. 
Take miners for instance.  What happens if there is a miner that doesn't want to adopt segwit because it narfles their asic hardware hashing algorithm?  Do we care? Should we care?  If we do care, what framework would we have to create in order to resolve such an issue?
These are the questions we need to ask ourselves now. And then develop a solution that meets our requirements. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 05:59:06
Emergent consensus lets miners decide, through force of hash, the block size. This provides for them an incentive such that, as they increase the block-size, it leads to the nodes not being able to be run except with massive connections to the other nodes and miners. The miners that are closer (in bandwidth) to the other nodes, will have more time to retrieve the transaction and block data. Nodes and miners on slower connections will further deplete, as they can't source the data fast enough. This will also mean that communication between miners will favor miners that are closer together.
This means, by design, bitmain will be able to force ALL miners and ALL nodes off of the network, and every node and every miner will be housed in bitmain data-centers.
You numpties are cheering for china-coin.

How about an algorithm that keeps changing as a function of the POW.  I'm trying to think of a method that would introduce a slowly mutating stochastic element.  Not enough to radically change anything, but such that, over time, would mutate the POW.  Each new block is different than the last, impossible to predict, and totally unique, so the seed is straightforward.  Is there any chip or hardware solution that assists in the identification of large number primes?
I think this is the only way (for now) that you could construct a POW that is hardware solution resistant.

Nodes ffs.  You are actually that clueless?  Ffs.  Listen numpty, I'm about to give you a crash course in bitcoin. 
Nodes enforce consensus rules.  That's what they do.  It is really their reason for existence.
Miners order valid transactions (defined by the nodes) by hashing transactions they select, and they provide a service to the network by making it infeasible to reverse transactions.  They do this by hashing the transactions to an algorithm that will produce a hash that meets a specific output parameter, and then they pass the block that meets that requirement to the nodes for validation.  The node then validates that block (two validations, txn first, then block after mining), and if it is valid, includes it to the blockchain.  The node then replicates the block to other nodes, so that they are informed that they need to remove the transactions that have been included in the block from their mempool, and to move on to the next block of transactions.  Each node that it is replicated to ALSO validates the block, and all of the transactions in it.  
So every node validates every block and every transaction.
It is YOUR lack of understanding that is being displayed here.  For the last few hours, I've had some other numpty like you [trying to laugh at my understanding of bitcoin]( because he also had no clue about what a node and miner does.  He then deleted all his comments about it because it showed how much of a numpty he was being.  Just stop it.

Anyone can fork whenever they want.  It will take an active decision, just like now, to create that fork.
@_date: 2017-02-26 09:14:54
Good?  That just means they soldier on then.  I don't think that's right though.
It's true that I'm still a bit unclear of how the non-segwit blocks and transactions are actually included by miners in blocks.  I thought the miner enabled soft-fork was still required in order for what you just described to happen.  Once the 95% activation is achieved, that system is in place, but until that time, it will still think that they're invalid transactions.  Happy to be enlightened on it though.
My understanding is that this proposal negates the requirement for the miner 95% activation that enables that ability.

Nope.  Higher utility means higher price, and therefore miners would earn more.  
Not that miners are responsible for security.  Nodes are.

@_date: 2017-03-05 08:46:07


'have'?  The users of bitcoin own it.  What the miners own is a commodified product that can be substituted for another if and when they fail to provide the service they're paid for.  The nodes enforce bitcoins consensus system, not the miners.  If the miners ever feel like they can provide a better service, they're welcome to.  I'll wish them good luck.
If you think that the developers aren't investigating how to quickly implement a new POW, or haven't got a solution already, if the miners get out of hand, you're kidding yourself.  Even Bitmain knows this, or they would be signalling ChinaBU with all of their hash-power right now, instead of through the viabtc and btc.top proxies.  I'm glad that the UASF proposal has brought this to a head.  It is clearly demonstrating that the users of bitcoin should plan for the reality of hostile miners like bitmain and yourself, and act accordingly.

The golden rule of TOR is to disable everything in the browser, and never to enable anything except the default settings.  Ulbricht wasn't caught because of a vulnerability in TOR, he was caught because he was connected to questions about setting up servers in the TOR network.  Most people who would be busted using TOR will have been caught because of honey-pots that enable 3rd-party scripting functions (like javascript) which ignore the TOR network for comms, and use regular TCP/IP.  That, or they find a TOR server using, again, traditional investigative work, and then insert their own front-end for it.  If you go onto a site that has, for example, a captcha that doesn't work without scripting, some people will turn it on in order for the function to work.  Bam, you're busted.  That simple.
But TOR itself?  It's like bitcoin as far as I'm aware.  There are ways you can game it in similar ways to 51% attacks in bitcoin, but the underlying protocol is secure.

While I think this is a good thought-process, I'm not sure this is how it works.  The 'hub' you speak of doesn't 'hold your coins'.  Your coins are held in a 'channel' which you hold.  The hub will route a buyer to a seller, or a buyer to a hub, to another hub, to a seller.
If a hub does anything, it will be nothing more than a router between channels.  Channels will be controlled by you, the user.  The one thing I think hubs could do, is enforce the protocol options, like that a channel is open for one week/month/fortnight, etc.
I really can't wait to play with this thing.  It really could be quite awesome.

I don't know the specifics, but that might depend on a determination of a tax-agent.  If a state considers bitcoin a good (like Australia does) it might have sales-tax applied (like Australia has the GST applied).  If said business had a chat with their tax agent, they might very well have made that determination.
Like I said, I don't now the specifics of this case, but there might be reasons that this is being driven by the seller.

It's actually a lot harder than that.  It's an issue alright, don't get me wrong.  But there are limits to what a miner can achieve when they control hashing.  Censoring spending by restricting which transactions get into which blocks is the most concerning.
But if push comes to shove, the nodes can change a POW and strand the infrastructure, because it's the nodes that validate the blocks.  No matter how much hashing the miner has, the nodes ultimately dictate the security of the network.
The POW 'security' isn't so much the POW, but the fact that the effort to undo changes becomes exponentially more difficult as blocks are built on top of blocks that use the previous block hashes as inputs.  It's the block-creation act itself that provides security, not the Proof-Of-Work process.

@_date: 2017-03-15 03:16:57
Over 80% of nodes have already upgraded to segwit capable clients.
The question that we as users should have, is what we're going to do about miners that think they control the bitcoin network.  Signalling isn't supposed to be 'voting'.  It's supposed to be about the miner letting the network know that they're ready.
Perhaps we should start investigating methods to ensure that miners are supported for not 'being ready' and the rest of the network can utilize miners that are, for the needs that the users want.  There might be good reasons why a miner isn't ready, nor will ever be ready for an upgrade.  The question is whether users still have a need for miners that would like to continue working the way they want, and whether there is any actual work for them to do, given the new uses that bitcoin users have implemented.  It might be the case that they never need to upgrade.

You [don't know know how a node works]( you [don't know how mining works]( so it's probably no surprise that you don't know how consensus works either.


No he hasn't.  But that's not surprising, because you clearly read things and don't understand what they mean.

I'll take my greed over your stupidity any day. 
The things you say you want gets destroyed by unlimited.  Unlimited means large corporate interests (i.e. miners) can write the rules in bitcoin. It is the opposite of decentralized.  It hands over power to the largest concentration of risk in bitcoin.  What the fuck do you think 'emergent consensus' means eh?  It means when the corporate guys get together that they work out who participates in their little club.  Call it what it is.  The reserve mining board.  THAT is the thing that is specific to unlimited.

Emergent consensus lets miners decide, through force of hash, the block size. This provides for them an incentive such that, as they increase the block-size, it leads to the nodes not being able to be run except with massive connections to the other nodes and miners. The miners that are closer (in bandwidth) to the other nodes, will have more time to retrieve the transaction and block data. Nodes and miners on slower connections will further deplete, as they can't source the data fast enough. This will also mean that communication between miners will favor miners that are closer together.
This means, by design, bitmain will be able to force ALL miners and ALL nodes off of the network, and every node and every miner will be housed in bitmain data-centers.

It is these statements that empower bitmain to continue on the path to a PoW change.
Let's recap : Bitmain is in no position to negotiate anything. It is signal segwit, or have it implemented anyway through a USAF type mechanism. Hard-fork if you don't want follow the soft-fork. PoW change if you attack the bitcoin blockchain after the fork.

It takes the wind out of the sails of the forkers.  It shows clearly who wants consensus, and who wants to obstruct scalability.  But even if they do, they still don't get what they want.  If they 51% attack (if they're capable of it), their hardware gets bricked with a PoW change. 
The reality is that while the consensus rules are hard to change, the users of bitcoin as defined by the people who use it through nodes, have all of the bullets. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 02:24:50
Yep.  Just discussing this with someone else.  If you were going UASF, you'd probably just time the UASF flag day to be the middle of a difficulty period.  For brevity, let's say 1000 blocks, and assume that 50% of miners mine segwit blocks.
- 1000 blocks : one week.  10 minute blocks.
- 1000 blocks : 50% hashing rate.  Two weeks.  20 minute blocks.
Three weeks til difficulty reset.  Then, because the difficulty calc will include both parts of this (50% full-mine, 50% half-mine), the new lowered difficulty will be 2/3 of the difficulty it was before, with 50% of the previous hashing power.  So ~15 minutes blocks.
Off the top of my head, I reckon that would be another three weeks instead of two.  Then the difficulty resets to the available miners, and you're back to normal.
So : 
UASF happens.
- Two weeks : 20 minute blocks
- ~Three weeks : ~15 minute blocks.
Then back to normal.   Assuming miners don't see the potential for huge fees to be had by switching over. Cuz, you know, money.  I might be out for a few days or so, but I reckon it'll be about this assuming 50%.  Seeing as I think bitmain actually has 50% or so of hashing power, I think I'll be close to right.
It's almost like you want bitmain to fork off.  Because blocks will be bigger, so more transactions, but the block creation time will be longer, so less blocks.  So less miners creating blocks less often, each with more transactions.  Net effect to miners?  More total fees in larger blocks and more for each miner.  Net effect to users?  Same fees for larger blocks that are created less often.
For those five weeks, miners will have a field-day.  50% more profit?  Good on em I say.

Coinbase wants to be the gateway between buyers and sellers using bitcoin.  When you have a wallet of theirs, and a transfer is between yourself and someone else in the coinbase network, they can charge you fees for the transaction, but the transaction happens off-chain.  This is especially true for users of their exchange service.  
Coinbase needs this pool of money to stay there and grow.  If it shrinks, as bitcoin gets moved out of their control into channels, they lose money.

And this is where your lack of understanding meets facts.
A nodes upload bandwidth requirement works or to be about 30GB **upload** per month per peer that it connects to for a 1MB block.  So if you have 8 peers (pretty close to minimum) that's about 240GB upload. If you double the block size, that's 480GB upload.  If you increase it to 8MB, it's about 2TB per month.   Upload. 
Normally, at this point, a person in your position would take this information, and either modify their position based upon evidence that they took no attempt to ascertain, and recognize that perhaps they should rethink why they have an opinion on something.  But you're not like that, are you?  You, instead, have an opinion without having a clue what they're talking about.  But no, your ilk are too busy talking talking talking without actually making any effort to determine whether what they're saying has any basis in reality.  You'll just keep talking shit, and talking shit, and talking shit, because that's all you know what to do.

OK.  Are you actually listening?  Hard-forks are never simple.  Never.  Never ever ever ever.  Never?  Not ever.  Never.  Now are we clear?
Segwit when it was originally being designed didn't have the block-size increase.  But a smart chappy named Luke Dashjr figured out a way to increase the block-size as a soft-fork.  They did this, because some people wanted to increase it to 2mb (i.e. bitcoin classic).  But bitcoin classic was a hard-fork.  Segwit is a larger increase than the original proposal.
So.  Segwit is easier.  It is a soft-fork.  If you're going to have a change, soft-forks are good.  They're backwardly compatible.  But hard-forks?  baaaaad.

It's not up to the users to ensure miners protect themselves from other miners. It's up to us, the users, to protect ourselves from miners. I don't have any sympathy for a miner that gets corrupted by another miner because they don't take the time to set up a bridge node. They already do this. They're earning block rewards. They should treat being a miner as the business it is. If they choose to not do it out of spite, I have little sympathy for them at all.
But with a UASF, because the nodes that are accepting and broadcasting transactions are segwit aware (80% of nodes and counting), they'll reject those blocks with malicious miner transactions. That'll be 90-95 by the time it is activated. The only people who are affected are miners that don't protect themselves. They'll get forked off never to be heard from again. Good riddance I say.
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:58:02
First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks, replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.

Miners don't validate transactions.  Nodes do.  Every node validates every transaction in the mempool, every block that is propagated to them, and every transaction in every one of those blocks.
These are some of the validations that all nodes do.




1. The transactions syntax and data structure are correct.
2. The input and outputs have values.
3. The transaction is less than the block size of 1 MB.
4. The values must be more than 0 and less than 21 million.
5. None of the inputs have a hash that is equal to 0.
6. The locktime is less than the maximum allowed number.
7. The transaction size is greater than or equal to 100 bytes.
8. The number of signatures is less than the signatute limit.
9. The unlocking script can only push numbers onto the stack.
10. The locking script must match isstandard format.
11. A matching transaction must exist.
12. If a transaction is missing move the transaction to the orphan transaction pool.
13. If the transaction is a coinbase transaction then it must have a maturity of 100 confirmations.
14. For each input the output must exist and not have been spent.
15. Check that each input value is in the required range.
16. Reject if the input value is less than the output value.
17. Reject if the transaction value is to low to get into an empty block.
18. The unlocking scripts for each input must be verified against the output locking scripts.
If you think otherwise, then you don't understand how bitcoin works.

Adoption is NOT stalling, as evidenced by the price of bitcoin, and the price of transactions.  If you wanna use a crypto with cheap transactions, use ethereum.  Use Litecoin.  Use one of the hundred or so that are available that allow for you to do this.  Go for it.  Enjoy.
While you use them, you should reflect on the reason why bitcoin keeps increasing in value, and they don't, and work out how much more value you would control if you had just kept using bitcoin.

Actually, there's no guarantee that the miners wouldn't continue just making blocks using non segwit txns.  As long as they had a bridging node, which they should have anyway, they'd effectively not know the difference. What they wouldn't be able to do anymore is veto what other miners put in their blocks. It also wouldn't matter if they left either.  Difficulty reset and you're back to normal.

Nodes don't signal.  If they are enabled to accept and create segwit transactions, that is what it is. Listening is immaterial to this discussion.

I'm concerned that the users might not be as large supporters as it seems.  It *seems* to have almost universal support from users and businesses, but you don't know for sure until you see how many users and business update their clients to a UASF enabled version.


Because it's a concern that a single company that is located in a totalitarian country that is concerned with capital flight probably owns &gt;50% of the hashing power.


For me, I would like bitcoin to be upgraded in the interests of users instead of monopolistic miners in totalitarian countries.

That is the invalid segwit transaction I was talking about.  As far as I'm aware, that's the only way.  That is achieved by someone actually attacking a miner by posting invalid segwit transactions, or a miner purposefully doing so, which is no different than today.  Not only that, but if it isn't the miner directly, that invalid segwit transaction has to be propagated past the overwhelming consensus of nodes that accept segwit transactions, and they'll block it.
There are also ways around even that likelihood for miners, by having bridging nodes that stop invalid segwit transactions from propagating to them.  And if the nodes that are accepting transactions are overwhelmingly only accepting segwit transactions (the point of UASF) the invalid transactions don't get to the miners in the first place.
So there is only one way a fork can occur, and even that can be managed in multiple ways.
EDIT: I've also learned since that only segwit aware nodes will even relay segwit transactions.  So existing nodes won't even propagate a non-valid segwit transaction.  So that closes even that avenue of attack.

I've no doubt that Assange is a fairly clever fellow, but just quoting the 'IQ well over 160' doesn't actually mean anything.  It's a fairly outdated metric, and doesn't reflect the different ways intelligence manifests itself.  Anything that starts approaching the 'superior' range is really enough to know, and beyond that, it starts becoming important to know specifics like abstract reasoning and spatial intelligence.  People will have varying abilities in many of the metrics that go to an intelligence measurement.

Maybe.  That's why it's so important to get segwit out of the way which provides a fairly good improvement, but more importantly allows the LN to be integrated so that we have a truly scalable solution.  Until then, we have a fee-market that demonstrably works even against low-fee spam-attacks.  Yet another attack vector neutralized.
And all of this will be fondly remembered as the early 2016 drama about nothing.  Or perhaps be remembered as the time corporate interests attempted to take control of bitcoin development, and failed.

For better or for worse, it would be a mostly trivial exercise for someone to track a bitcoin transaction to the person who acquired the bitcoin through AML/KYC.  Until the lightning network is up, I don't think this is going to be possible.

ChinaBU users regularly regularly mistake miner signalling for voting.  Over 75% of nodes have already upgraded to segwit aware clients.
And UASF is now starting to get fleshed out to a real implementation proposal, so that the chinese miner, bitmain, that is blocking scalability and privacy improvements in bitcoin, will have that blocking capability taken away from them.
The good thing is that it is happening now.  It'll be the accepted logic in two years that miners don't have the ability to dictate bitcoin consensus rules.  After segwit is implemented, and bitmain either does what they're told, or takes their hardware elsewhere, no-one will ever attempt the same tactic again.
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:22:41

And you know what?  You're going to get scalability in bitcoin, in spite of you.  And you're going to get it because UASF gives miners the choice of upgrading or not, contributing or not, and without them having to change anything.  The only thing miners are going to lose, is their ability to veto scalability improvements.

@_date: 2017-03-20 08:14:25
You really haven't thought this through, have you?  Let's assume we're talking about mid epoch, and bitmain forks without attacking and takes half of the hashpower.  The only thing we can really be sure of, yes?  The average?  For brevity, let's say 1000 blocks.
    1000 blocks : one week. 10 minute blocks.
    1000 blocks : 50% hashing rate. Two weeks. 20 minute blocks.
Three weeks til difficulty reset. Then, because the difficulty calc will include both parts of this (50% full-mine, 50% half-mine), the new lowered difficulty will be 2/3 of the difficulty it was before, with 50% of the previous hashing power. So ~15 minutes blocks.
Off the top of my head, I reckon that would be another three weeks instead of two. Then the difficulty resets to the available miners, and you're back to normal.
So :
Fork happens.
    Two weeks : 20 minute blocks
    ~Three weeks : ~15 minute blocks.
Then back to normal. Assuming miners don't see the potential for huge fees to be had by switching over. Cuz, you know, money. I might be out for a few days or so, but I reckon it'll be about this assuming 50%. Seeing as I think bitmain actually has 50% or so of hashing power, I think I'll be close to right.
It's almost like you want bitmain to fork off. Because blocks will be bigger, so more transactions, but the block creation time will be longer, so less blocks. So less miners creating blocks less often, each with more transactions. Net effect to miners? More total fees in larger blocks and more for each miner. Net effect to users? Same fees for larger blocks that are created less often.
For those five weeks, miners will have a field-day. 50% more profit? Good on em I say.
And if they do attack?  PoW change (to something like Keccak that already has an infrastructure?) and bonza, off we go again, no difficulty reset, and everyone wants to pile into keccak mining.
@_date: 2017-03-08 11:58:45


No, you're incorrect.  Nodes validate transactions and blocks.  Miners do nothing more transaction ordering.  Nodes ensure consensus is maintained.  Nodes do security.  Blockchain security is a by-product of nodes ensuring miners don't cheat.  Like bitmain is tying to do.


Incorrect.   Miners are only interested in blocks propagating to miners they control, and to the node that manages their gateway to the network.  Therefore, it is in the mining best interests, for nodes and miners to be centralized.


Incorrect.  Miners want OTHER miners to be orphaned.  Miners WANT to be the ONLY miner, because miners are not concerned with security.  Miners want all of the block reward and transaction fees for themselves.

Segwit is actually very popular.  Don't listen to the screaming numpties.  97% of nodes use core software and &gt;83% have already upgraded to segwit enabled clients.  
The only thing I'll say about hard forks is that they are bad.  The only reason you use them is when something bad happens. Segwit is a soft fork. 
But then there is the problem of miners.  BU and the new variant of the chinese cabal of bitcoin miners BitcoinEC have a key consensus change implemented in them called 'Emergent Consensus'
Emergent consensus lets miners decide, through force of hash, the block size. This provides for them an incentive such that, as they increase the block-size, it leads to the nodes not being able to be run except with massive connections to the other nodes and miners. The miners that are closer (in bandwidth) to the other nodes, will have more time to retrieve the transaction and block data. Nodes and miners on slower connections will further deplete, as they can't source the data fast enough. This will also mean that communication between miners will favor miners that are closer together.
This means, by design, bitmain will be able to force ALL miners and ALL nodes off of the network, and every node and every miner will be housed in bitmain data-centers. It is a hostile take-over of the bitcoin environment by a chinese company that has all the markings of a state-sponsored action.
Bitmain is currently using their power to this end.  Recognizing that, new proposals like UASF (user activated soft fork) are being fleshed out.  Believe it or not, there really is no hurry.  This is what happens when UASF happens. Bitmain loses their ability to block scalability anymore, and is in no position to negotiate anything. It is signal segwit, or have it implemented anyway through a USAF type mechanism. Hard-fork if you don't want to follow the soft-fork. PoW change if you attack the bitcoin blockchain after the fork, which renders hundreds of millions of dollars worth of hardware they own obsolete.   In other words, do your job or you're fired.
It is this situation that is happening now. The ones screaming are the ones on the side of the hostile takeover.  They're screaming because that is the only thing they can do.

Sadly, that's not enough reason for people to do it, as is evidenced by the gradual reduction in nodes.  I know that was the way it was envisaged, but it turns out that that hasn't come about.


I'm not talking about running a node from the perspective of a user / bitcoin spender.  A P2P connection (what the LN is?) still requires some handshaking, in order to connect peers.  Those transactions are still going to need to be 'bundled up' and the ultimate settlement is still on the block-chain.  My understanding is that it will be bundled as one single transaction, or some smaller number of transactions, than the total that has been accrued on the lightning network.  I'm assuming this has to happen somewhere, but wouldn't the most appropriate place for this to occur be the node?  Doesn't that possibility lend itself to providing an incentive to the person/node who facilitated the transaction?
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:46:05

They could fork now. You know what's funny? They're not even using ChinaBU. If they were they'd be constantly forking themselves off of the network. That means they're signaling ChinaBU, but are actually using core.  How pathetic is that?

Segwit is a block-size increase.


Which allows bitmain to game the network, and force every node and miner except ones they control off of the network.  Your version of bitcoin is every node and miner being run out of data-centers in china controlled by a single company, bitmain.  That's what 'emergent consensus' means.  It means 'do what we say, or we crush you'.

No they are not. A miner has a node, but they are not a node. It is the nodes that a miner doesn't control that keeps them honest.
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:34:33


And the miners that test out this theory will find out that they're wrong.  Nothing will happen except users will be able to create segwit transactions of course, but they'll still be wrong.

Ya need to stop getting your information from the rbtc cesspool lad. It makes ya brain go soft.
@_date: 2017-03-09 02:05:56


No they don't.  Many times they specifically remove any possible validation by only replicating header information.  They pass the block they've created onto a node which they control, which then validates.  But that node has to conform to bitcoin consensus, or it will be rejected as soon as it is replicated to another node.  This exact thing happened about a month ago when one of these ChinaBU miners created a block that didn't satisfy consensus rules, and was forked off of the network.


If they don't produce a valid block as defined by the nodes, it doesn't matter how much hash-power they have.  It will be rejected.  The issue is that if they continue building on these blocks, and they have a significant amount of hashing power, they'll fork the network.  But even when that happens, the nodes will still reject those blocks.


I think you're getting your terminologies wrong.  Nodes don't have hashpower, miners do.  Nodes enforce consensus rules, not miners.
All of a bit of a muchness though, at least as far as what you're saying.  I'm just being a bit more specific of what elements do what on the bitcoin network.  It's just important to sometimes be pedantic, because there's a lot of confusion and ignorance around, but it doesn't stop people making blanket statements that are completely false because they don't understand these things.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:02:31
I'll keep posting it until you understand it.  None of you fn numpties even know what ChinaBU does.
Emergent consensus lets miners decide, through force of hash, the block size. This provides for them an incentive such that, as they increase the block-size, it leads to the nodes not being able to be run except with massive connections to the other nodes and miners. The miners that are closer (in bandwidth) to the other nodes, will have more time to retrieve the transaction and block data. Nodes and miners on slower connections will further deplete, as they can't source the data fast enough. This will also mean that communication between miners will favor miners that are closer together.
This means, by design, bitmain will be able to force ALL miners and ALL nodes off of the network, and every node and every miner will be housed in bitmain data-centers.
You numpties are cheering for china-coin.

I don't agree.  With a layered solution, you can implement lightning, solve the coffee purchase ideal of bitcoin as spare change.  That might very well be the end of it.
More importantly, a further block size increase, if it was found to be a desirable requirement, and judged to be safe without sacrificing decentralization, could conceivably be implemented through [extension blocks]( as a soft-fork.  
But first we need to stress-test segwit in a real production environment, for years, and see what actual effect the block-size increase has on the network.  Then, and only then, the technical experts can reliably ascertain how safe any further block-size increase actually is.
All done without a hard-fork.

@_date: 2017-02-26 05:45:27

Either you're capable of synthesizing the great amount of time and effort people put into educating you bruce, or you're not.

And today, big surprise, we have a new conversation about how core has to 'compromise'.
What you need to be doing bruce, is to stop trying to insert yourself into an argument without attempting to understand the argument.  You're not helping, and I haven't seen any evidence that would lead me to believe that you're trying to help.

You seriously don't know how bitcoin works dude.  You really need to rectify that before you continue opining on subjects of which you know little.
PS+Edit: You know what this shows?  It shows only people that don't support segwit really don't have a fkn clue what they're talking about.  They're people that are almost exclusively loud, ignorant, and dogmatic.  Almost every person you find that knows how bitcoin works, is not like you.  I don't get it.  The resources to understand are there, and the entire project is open-source.  There are experts that will answer your questions.  How do I know?  Because they answered my questions.

Is it because you don't know how to program?  That's the stuff I don't know.  Bitcoin?  Complex but not that difficult to understand as a concept once you understand how it is structured.

Come back when you know what a node does sunshine.


- Blocks may only create a certain number of bitcoins. (Currently 12.5 BTC per block.)
- Transactions must have correct signatures for the bitcoins being spent.
- Transactions/blocks must be in the correct data format.
- Within a single block chain, a transaction output cannot be double-spent.






1. The transactions syntax and data structure are correct.
2. The input and outputs have values.
3. The transaction is less than the block size of 1 MB.
4. The values must be more than 0 and less than 21 million.
5. None of the inputs have a hash that is equal to 0.
6. The locktime is less than the maximum allowed number.
7. The transaction size is greater than or equal to 100 bytes.
8. The number of signatures is less than the signatute limit.
9. The unlocking script can only push numbers onto the stack.
10. The locking script must match isstandard format.
11. A matching transaction must exist.
12. If a transaction is missing move the transaction to the orphan transaction pool.
13. If the transaction is a coinbase transaction then it must have a maturity of 100 confirmations.
14. For each input the output must exist and not have been spent.
15. Check that each input value is in the required range.
16. Reject if the input value is less than the output value.
17. Reject if the transaction value is to low to get into an empty block.
18. The unlocking scripts for each input must be verified against the output locking scripts.

Which is no different today.  Malicious miners are malicious miners.  They exist, and you have protect yourself from them.
The miners can decide to fork, but they have to decide to do it.  And it is in the miners best interests to ensure they're protecting themselves from malicious miners too.  You think that it should be up to other people to protect you when they've already given you the tools to do so?
But UASF doesn't lead to a fork unless one of two conditions is met.
1. A miner decides to fork.
2. A miner doesn't protect themselves from a malicious miner forking, and builds on a corrupt block.
When you understand that those are the only two circumstances under which this can occur, you recognize that it isn't UASF that's an issue, it's miners, and you develop a solution accordingly.

If you don't know what a node does and what a miner does, then you clearly don't know how bitcoin works.  How do you think you're going to contribute to a discussion about nodes and miners when it is explicitly demonstrated that you don't understand the subject?

Because bitmain is btc.top, via.btc and antpool  they control at least 30%, maybe 40% and possibly even 50% of the hashing power of bitcoin.

You can't spin up nodes that make or receive transactions, because people don't use them.  That's the thing you silly little numpties never get.

@_date: 2017-03-19 07:44:41
No.  The definition of nodes hasn't changed.  It has never changed.  When Satoshi refers to a 'node' it is the same node that it has always been, and you can [download the node software and run it on your computer at any time.](  It is currently version 0.14.0
He doesn't know the difference between a node and a miner.  When you say node, he thinks miner.  If you think this, then you don't know what a node is, and you don't know what node does.  That misunderstanding is something that seems very common for people who spend their time in the rbtc cesspool.


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks, replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.

? Now we're talking about something different.  Either party may close the channel (I think) or it is closed at the schedule set when the channel was created.  There is then a delay (a week?) in which the other party has the opportunity to validate whether the person who closed the channel has a valid chain.  If at any time the two chains are different, we enter into the adversarial conditions mentioned above.
I imagine the person who created the channel pays to close it.  However, the receiver may also use CPFP in order to ensure the payment is processed on the blockchain if the fee wasn't high enough when the channel was created.
I'm sure there are much smarter people than me that could explain it.  But that's my understanding.

This fundamental misunderstanding of even the words.  I've already explained, with evidence, what this word actually is and means, and it aint the word you're using.  How are you supposed to have a technical discussion with a guy that refuses to even learn the definitions of the words?
First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




Nodes are the agents in a multi-agent system enforcing consensus.
Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.

A chinese company named bitmain is attempting a hostile take-over of bitcoin by using software developed by a vastly inferior development team.  This software allows them to take over the management of settings of the network, and force off all of the other miners and validators (called nodes) off of the network, so that all bitcoin transactions are managed by them.
The developers of bitcoin have developed an upgrade called segwit that increases the capacity of bitcoin, while at the same time adds privacy features for people who use it.  The question is why they're blocking it, as these upgrade features make bitcoin a far more valuable system. As this is hurting their business bottom-line, an assumption is that the chinese government is using bitmain in order to block the changes, because it will lead to more capital flight from the country.  Essentially, they want to turn bitcoin into china-coin.
The problem is, their software doesn't work, and their supporters have generally no clue how bitcoin validation works.  So they're threatening to attack bitcoin unless they get their way.  They are loud, and have attacks that they can mount, but if there is ever a serious threat, the nodes of the network can change a couple of settings, and turn bitmains hundreds of millions of dollars of hardware into junk.
tldr : Big company in totalitarian country trying to use social media to destroy bitcoin to stop it being used to move money out of china.  Cheered on by farkinidjits.

No.  Actually they didn't. What happened is that a significant number of McNodes were spawned by the rbtc numpties as cloud instances in order to inflate node numbers. Those nodes, that no one ever used, had cloud based bandwidth.  And let's not forget miners.  They have nodes too.   Big fat centralized ones. 
But nodes that people actually use?  The ones that support the health of the network, you know, like the ones in Australia? They have the identical bandwidth they had last year.  And the year before that.  And five years before that.  And ten years before that.

It wasn't necessary to have the blocksize increase with SegWit.  The re-organization could have been handled just as easily with both the witness and non-witness data included without increasing the blocksize, and it STILL would have had the malleability fix and been a better solution to the abortion that is ChinaBU and emergent consensus.

You don't know how LN works.  The capital 'tied-up' is between two parties.
So. Lightning. Lightning allows users to take a single bitcoin transaction, and use it over a finite space of time, in order to shift bitcoin back and forth, with no or vanishingly small transaction fees, as iou's between what's are called 'lightning channels'. The actual transaction size will be the same as a normal transaction, with a flag that says it can only be committed to the blockchain at a specific time (or block depth). In effect, these lightning transactions are cryptographically signed 'iou's. The 'thousands' of back-and-forth iou changes are discarded when the channel is closed (massive privacy dividend), and only the aggregated change is committed to the blockchain. This is the great thing about lightning. It is a single transaction with as many inputs and outputs (one/two) as defined in the original transaction. Only the transaction values change.
Consider a channel link of this : John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne. Only the people next to each people in the chain have a 'channel open' with each other (John/Bob, Bob/Sally, Sally/Anne). Assuming each of the channels between all of the participants have adequate funds in order to achieve this, if John wanted to send 1btc to Anne. A transaction ledger would read :
John-&gt;Bob channel : John -1btc, Bob +1btc
Bob-&gt;Sally channel : Bob -1btc, Sally +1btc
Sally-&gt;Anne channel : Sally -1btc, Anne +1btc.
Anne now has 1btc more, and John has 1btc less, but the net effect in each channel is simply a modification to the distribution of bitcoin in that channel.
Imagine this happening, back and forth, and extended to thousands, tens of thousands, and millions of people. As long as there's a chain between them, you use the chain. You might even have your transaction split over multiple chains. For links that don't have a chain, you create a channel on-the-fly.
Each channel, therefore, only ends up with the same single input, and the same two outputs, just differing values.
It's significantly more complex than that (transaction routing, and channel closure mechanics), but that's the idea. I wish I could remember the lightning dev that explained it. It really is very clever. I haven't actually questioned about the effect of having channels with multiple inputs (John/Sally) and outputs (Bob/Anne) at inception. Technically, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible. Just a much weirder set of ramifications.
That's my understanding, anyway.  The hubs are really just relays (which, of course, is a little bit more complex than that).

This is a great tool for splitting up a message that requires X-of-Y parts in order to put it back together.
   
You can create a message with 2 of 5, or 3 of 4, that requires any of X parts and will allow you to re-create the message.  You can save the page itself as a HTML file, and it can be used in any browser.  If you distribute those parts to people you trust, it would require them to conspire against you in order to put the parts back together again.  Personally, if that's happening, that's the least of my worries.
If you put each part into a password protected zip (or a small truecrypt volume), it would take several levels of decryption, and then coercion of people, in order to access the content.

Just time the UASF flag day to a block height 1000 blocks from the difficulty reset. You'd have to do it in the middle. Then it would take two resets. Because the difficulty is set based upon the total hashing of the previous period. But it would be ~30% speed for a couple of weeks. ~60% for four weeks, then back to normal.  Assuming miners don't see the potential for huge fees to be had by switching over. Cuz, you know, money.

CPFP.  If you want your bitcoin back, you can up the fee, or the entire transaction will be cancelled.  So it's up to you... if you feel the value of the channel is worth the effort of retrieving it, you can.  No different than a bitcoin transaction today really.


The LN channel creation is a bitcoin transaction with a delay of completion.  I'm not sure why you think that an LN channel isn't bitcion.

What most people like you don't get is what the effect of that incentive structure has.  There is only one outcome to it, which is why creating incentives in a decentralized network is so important, and why bitcoin works so well.  ChinaBU breaks it, and hands control over to the miner that is best at monopolizing resources.

That might or might not be a problem.  Bitcoin, natively, will never have that functionality, because blocks are only created once every 10 minutes on average, and you require six confirmations in order to ensure a transaction will not be re-org'd out.
This function might very well be what users want.  Lightning as a technology should allow this to be enabled.  But the jury is still out on whether users are actually interested in that functionality.  I think they are, as the 80% of segwit nodes would seem to indicate that at least some people view the malleability fix as an enabler for that functionality.  Who am I to say though?  It might very well be the case.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:36:53
You know what?   I'm not gonna dismiss it so easily.  
The issue we have in bitcoin right now, is that mining infrastructure maintenance (to earn rewards+txn fees) is a large proportion of the total market value of the asset.  
People are prepared to pay fees right now at the price they are.  That's a reality.  The price of fees is going up, not down.  Many people would say you've got a good marketable product.
But that isn't the only way that they can go.  There are other bitcoin solutions that remove a significant portion of activity off of the chain, and aggregates the transactions before they are committed.  This might, at the same time, lower fees and increase the price considerably, thus making the reward a more valuable thing to acquire than the transaction fee.
One day, that dust may be worth multiples above the fee.
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:14:54


I've already explained the error in your thinking.  Please feel free to review the thread if you didn't get it the first time.


The network works the way it is.  If you want scalability and several orders of magnitude more transactions (3tps to 3000tps) get behind segwit and lightning, because that's what they do.  It is that scalability improvement that is being blocked by bitmain, the chinese miner.  Even in ChinaBU's wildest imaginings, they're not even close to that scalability outcome.  You would require hundreds of terabytes a month per node.


So back up being wrong repeatedly by centralizing nodes in a smaller number of cloud service providers?  You really don't understand even the concept of decentralization, do you?
Listen dude, you seriously haven't thought this through.  I don't know where you're getting this mistaken belief that you know what you're talking about, but you don't.  You should stop commenting until your understanding improves.  If you have actual questions, I, and many people better than me, will be willing to answer your questions.  But you need to divorce yourself from this belief that you're bringing anything to this discussion except your ignorance, which is OK, because until you know something, you are, by definition, ignorant.  The question is whether you're bringing a desire to learn as well.

Child Pays For Parent.  You can use an unconfirmed txn, and send some of the contents of that txn to an address, and as long as the miner fee for the child txn is enough to be included in the blockchain, the parent is included as well.


I think that was covered.  You can't have a record that someone paid something without that proof.  If you try to forge it, you lose the contents of the channel.
The only real risk is if you, in fact, have the shorter chain, and you are trying to scam the other user.  Let's say you're Bob, and you have a $100 payment channel with Alice, and all of that $100 is with you.  You back up your channel.  You send $50 to Alice, and everyone agrees.  You delete your channel, and restore from a backup.  You now have a record of $100 in your channel, but Alice has $50 that you gave here.
So you try and close the channel without Alice knowing about it.  But you have to wait to find out whether Alice uses that channel in the seven days.  That's something that is required.  If they don't, they're gonna be out of luck, because they're not going to show you that they have a longer chain that authorized giving Alice $50.  That's the adversarial attack, and why you need the seven days.
I'm not sure what happens in non-adversarial differences (lost phone, etc.).  I'm sure that's something that can be covered in implementation.  I'm still not exactly clear about what information the "hub's" actually contain.  They might also contain the agreed channel between Bob/Alice.  Have to wait and see that one.  Can't see too much reason why it would be a problem.
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:19:41

@_date: 2017-03-20 22:15:13
I shall help!
So. Lightning. Lightning allows users to take a single bitcoin transaction, and use it over a finite space of time, in order to shift bitcoin back and forth, with no or vanishingly small transaction fees, as iou's between what's are called 'lightning channels'. The actual transaction size will be the same as a normal transaction, with a flag that says it can only be committed to the blockchain at a specific time (or block depth). In effect, these lightning transactions are cryptographically signed 'iou's. The 'thousands' of back-and-forth iou changes are discarded when the channel is closed (massive privacy dividend), and only the aggregated change is committed to the blockchain. This is the great thing about lightning. It is a single transaction with as many inputs and outputs (one/two) as defined in the original transaction. Only the transaction values change.
Consider a channel link of this : John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne. Only the people next to each people in the chain have a 'channel open' with each other (John/Bob, Bob/Sally, Sally/Anne). Assuming each of the channels between all of the participants have adequate funds in order to achieve this, if John wanted to send 1btc to Anne. A transaction ledger would read :
John-&gt;Bob channel : John -1btc, Bob +1btc
Bob-&gt;Sally channel : Bob -1btc, Sally +1btc
Sally-&gt;Anne channel : Sally -1btc, Anne +1btc.
Anne now has 1btc more, and John has 1btc less, but the net effect in each channel is simply a modification to the distribution of bitcoin in that channel.
Imagine this happening, back and forth, and extended to thousands, tens of thousands, and millions of people. As long as there's a chain between them, you use the chain. You might even have your transaction split over multiple chains. For links that don't have a chain, you create a channel on-the-fly.
Each channel, therefore, only ends up with the same single input, and the same two outputs, just differing values.
It's significantly more complex than that (transaction routing, and channel closure mechanics), but that's the idea. I wish I could remember the lightning dev that explained it. It really is very clever. I haven't actually questioned about the effect of having channels with multiple inputs (John/Sally) and outputs (Bob/Anne) at inception. Technically, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible. Just a much weirder set of ramifications.
So THAT is a bitcoin scalability solution. THAT is what segwit enables. INCLUDING a block size increase, and the other bug fixes. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:14:59
Segwit is a blocksize increase.  That is a fact. Users overwhelmingly support this blocksize increase.  That is also a fact. Not every blocksize increase, this one.  Bitmain doesn't decide what user functionality exists in bitcoin. This proposal is saying point blank "do your job or get another job."
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:20:05
None of you fn numpties even know what ChinaBU does.
Emergent consensus lets miners decide, through force of hash, the block size. This provides for them an incentive such that, as they increase the block-size, it leads to the nodes not being able to be run except with massive connections to the other nodes and miners. The miners that are closer (in bandwidth) to the other nodes, will have more time to retrieve the transaction and block data. Nodes and miners on slower connections will further deplete, as they can't source the data fast enough. This will also mean that communication between miners will favor miners that are closer together.
This means, by design, bitmain will be able to force ALL miners and ALL nodes off of the network, and every node and every miner will be housed in bitmain data-centers.
You numpties are cheering for china-coin.

@_date: 2017-03-15 03:28:17
Incorrect.  Nodes define consensus, not miners.  
The question we should have is whether we, as the users of bitcoin, and the controllers of the nodes, actually want to use features like segwit.  Once you recognize that, the argument is reframed from "how do we convince miners to adopt changes we want" to "how do we select miners to propagate the changes we want, without affecting the miners that can't or won't implement the changes we want."
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:47:40

And yet, here we are.  The only actual veto that exists in bitcoin, is the consensus rules enforced by nodes.  Bitmain is now learning this, and they don't like it.  Looks like the creation of china-coin is going to be a little harder than they thought.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:16:48
I still think we need to understand whether there is an actual issue with the implementation of a solution that affects the miners.  They too are users of bitcoin.  But first things first, we need to, as users, understand what we want.  If we want to adopt a technology, we need to decide it, and do it.  Then, we can work out how best to implement said technology that is easiest to do give the constraints of what currently is.

@_date: 2017-03-04 14:18:24
The point of the UA in UASF is the ensure that the entire network acts as a 'border node'.  If he wants to fork himself, or some miner wants to fork themselves, they're welcome to.  They've always been welcome to.
The larger point is that there will be more transactions to mine by miners by adopting segwit, so there's an incentive.  The only people who won't want this incentive are people trying to attack the network.  They'll be a decreasing pool of miners, with less fees, and only interested in attacking the network anyway.  If those miners wanted to split, they'd have split already.  If miners truly don't want to mine segwit, they'll now have the opportunity.  UASF upgrades aren't about protecting them.  Those miners have already signalled ChinaBU, so clearly it was never an intention of them to support SegWit.  What this proposal does is protect the miners that don't want to upgrade their node clients, allow users to have functionality that they want, and make it explicitly clear that you can continue on the way you were before, but you can't stop users getting what they want by holding a veto power.
And if they all get to the 95% threshold because of this anyway, it all becomes a moot point.

Well... I was being a little faceitious.  It is true, that it in order to scale to that level (50K txns per sec), a block-size increase is more than likely required if one were to deliver it solely with segwit and lightning.  But it is pretty ludicrous to think that bitcoin is going to get there in the next five to 10 years though, if ever.  The reality is, there might very well be other solutions anyway like side-chains, to handle that type of load.
But if a block-size increase was required in the future beyond the block-size increase of segwit, it can be implemented as a soft-fork with extension blocks, if and when it doesn't affect decentralization.

Nope.  Nodes define consensus rules.  Any block produced by the china-coin miners will be rejected as invalid. The only thing that will happen will be that there will be a slowdown in transactions for a few weeks until the difficulty reset.

No, you don't understand how bitcoin works.  Nodes defend the blockchain.  It is they who validate transactions and blocks, not miners.  Miners order transactions in blocks that they ask nodes to validate.  Nothing more.
Who do you think replicates the consensus rules?  Who do you think replicates the blockchain?  Who do you think replicates the incoming transactions?  Nodes do of course.

Not if you are in favor of one you don't.  If you want to understand my disdain, it was because of that statement you made in the first sentence.  "I want a hard-fork"


Incorrect.  Any segwit enabled client will immediately be able to create segwit transactions that will allow the block-size to increase.




Actually a requirement.  And it was done as a compromise to classic supporters.  Segwit did not require a block-size increase.  Core came up with a new technology to extend the block-size without a hard-fork.  That's the thing being blocked by bitmain and the crowd at rbtc.


Yes.  I get that.  When you grab your information from a cesspool, it leads to a distortion of reality.

@_date: 2017-03-15 08:35:18
Never going to happen.  They have to get the users that currently run nodes using a core reference to change.  If they create a reference that had all of the things that the current node owners wanted, including things they've already agreed to, they might be able to achieve this.  If they ignore what the node owners have already clearly stated they want, they won't be able to achieve their aim of getting users to adopt their client instead of cores.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:19:13
Dude, nodes wait for a valid block that will eventually come.  Even if the hashing is 90% producing invalid blocks, they're still invalid.  Their entire invalid chain gets extinguished as soon as a single valid block is found.  Poof.  Gone.  The only thing that a miner producing invalid blocks accomplishes is producing an invalid blockchain that no-one knows even exists.
Already 80% of nodes have upgraded to segwit enabled clients.  97% of nodes, and every single exchange, light wallet, payment processor, and business uses a core client that only accepts blocks according to this consensus mechanism.  The only way ChinaBU is ever going to happen is if bitmain convinces all of those people and businesses to turn off their consensus enforcing nodes.  It is never going to happen.

@_date: 2017-03-25 22:47:42
Yep.  At 50% of miners there's almost no effect at all because blocks double in size but occur half as often. Yawn.
And we get lightning instant transactions to boot.  Meanwhile, china-coin probably has a another few fatal failures, except this time they're not gonna have core devs help identify the problem. 
Bitcoin miners will have a field day.  Their profits will double for the time it takes for the reset.
@_date: 2017-02-15 21:01:34
Doesn't stop it being right. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 08:49:14


Totally false.
Emergent consensus, the block-size setting mechanism in ChinaBU, lets miners decide, through force of hash, the block size. This provides for them an incentive such that, as they increase the block-size, it leads to the nodes not being able to be run except with massive connections to the other nodes and miners. The miners that are closer (in bandwidth) to the other nodes, will have more time to retrieve the transaction and block data. Nodes and miners on slower connections will further deplete, as they can't source the data fast enough. This will also mean that communication between miners will favor miners that are closer together.
This means, by design, bitmain will be able to force ALL miners and ALL nodes off of the network, and every node and every miner will be housed in bitmain data-centers.
I'm sure bitmain would like to be the single miner, and the single node provider of bitcoin. But I'm not interested in bitcoin becoming china-coin thanks.

BU has three really big problems.  Well... besides the question on whether they have the ability to deliver a solution.  But they're not actually insurmountable problems ('cept the ability thing, maybe).
Problem number 1.  Quadratic hashing fix.  It doesn't have it.  If they want blocks bigger, they're going to need to implement it.  That's a fact.
Problem number 2.  Block Size.  They have not placed an upper bound on their block size proposal, so it has an incentive for miners to kill off all miners and nodes.  That's a fact.  You can't change the consensus mechanism for miners, and re-direct the incentives towards miners, or, as sure as the sun rises tomorrow, they'll use the incentives exactly as you expect them to.
Problem number 3.  No actual user support.  No-one is actually using their node client. No-one is using their node-client for creating transactions.  Without user support, they aint gonna go nowhere.
The solution is actually a process.  If they want to have any prospect of being a reference client, they need to discard the current reference of core 0.12 and base it on 0.14.  This solves the quadratic hashing fix problem number 1, and actually solves part of problem number 3, because it implements segwit and the malleability fix, which actually has user/node support, as evidenced by the 80% of nodes that have already upgraded to be segwit aware.  If they don't recognize that, then they're effectively saying that 80% of users don't know what they want, can't get what they want, and they know better.  Good luck with that guys.
Then, they need to ditch the emergent consensus framework, and set a block-size that they actually think will be accepted by users and therefore users may install their node client, and use it.
What the BU developers have failed to grasp, is that the UASF proposal would work for them too.  If they felt that block size was too low, they could provide a client that increases it, and find out from users whether they agree with the changes.  Without an upper bounds set on the blocksize, it will never happen. 
If they want to achieve their goal of increasing the block-size (beyond the segwit blocksize doubling that is), they have to start respecting what users want.  Like core, they provide options that users may select.  Neither Core, BU, nor miners can dictate what the users want.  The only thing they can do is provide options that allow users to select which options they would prefer, or whether they are happy continuing on without upgrading at all.

There are lots of other methods that are being investigated, like UASF, that will be able to overcome bitmain blocking scalability and privacy improvements to bitcoin.  It just isn't going to happen overnight. This false sense of urgency is being perpetuated by a small vocal group that wants people to accept chinese control of bitcoin.  But it really is just a social attack.  The bitcoin network, through the nodes, already has over 75% of segwit support. 
We'll see where we stand in November.  Bitmain might see the writing on the wall by then.
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:25:57


Actually not true.  Because the chain that doesn't satisfy SegWit node requirements won't be propagated, because of the UA part of UASF.  No nodes that accept transactions will have any indication that there is a different chain.  No-one, therefore, will build upon it.  That's the point.  That's why you wouldn't even need 10% of the mining power, it would just take longer.  It is this reality that Jihan Wu has probably just figured out.
What you've just said there kind of highlights that this isn't clear to you.  


I think it'd be more certain if the miners knew that there was no choice about them blocking scalability, and they might as well get used to increased blocks and more fees now.

@_date: 2017-03-01 05:31:45


Right.  So let's start.  What you need to stop doing, is thinking you should have any opinion at all, until you know what you're talking about.  It's not opinion first, justification later.  It's justification first, opinion later.  Try it.
So.  Lightning.  Lightning allows users to take a single bitcoin transaction, and use it over a finite space of time, in order to shift bitcoin back and forth, with no or vanishingly small transaction fees, as iou's between what are called 'lightning channels'.  The actual transaction size will be the same as a normal transaction, with a flag that says it can only be committed to the blockchain at a specific time (or block depth).  In effect, these lightning transactions are cryptographically signed 'iou's.  The 'thousands' of back-and-forth iou changes are discarded when the channel is closed (massive privacy dividend), and only the aggregated change is committed to the blockchain. This is the great thing about lightning. It is a single transaction with as many inputs and outputs (one/two) as defined in the original transaction. Only the transaction values change.
Consider a channel link of this : John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne. Only the people next to each people in the chain have a 'channel open' with each other (John/Bob, Bob/Sally, Sally/Anne). Assuming each of the channels between all of the participants have adequate funds in order to achieve this, if John wanted to send 1btc to Anne. A transaction ledger would read :
  John-&gt;Bob channel : John -1btc, Bob +1btc
  Bob-&gt;Sally channel : Bob -1btc, Sally +1btc
  Sally-&gt;Anne channel : Sally -1btc, Anne +1btc.
Anne now has 1btc more, and John has 1btc less, but the net effect in each channel is simply a modification to the distribution of bitcoin in that channel.
Imagine this happening, back and forth, and extended to thousands, tens of thousands, and millions of people. As long as there's a chain between them, you use the chain. You might even have your transaction split over multiple chains. For links that don't have a chain, you create a channel on-the-fly.
Each channel, therefore, only ends up with the same single input, and the same two outputs, just differing values.
It's significantly more complex than that (transaction routing, and channel closure mechanics), but that's the idea. I wish I could remember the lightning dev that explained it. It really is very clever.  I haven't actually questioned about the effect of having channels with multiple inputs (John/Sally) and outputs (Bob/Anne) at inception. Technically, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible. Just a much weirder set of ramifications.
So THAT is a bitcoin scalability solution.  THAT is what segwit enables.  INCLUDING a block size increase, and the other bug fixes.  
So just stop.

These transactions aren't committed to the blockchain, only the final reconciliations are.  The more channels there are, the more traffic between them.

Lightning will allow instantaneous transactions, something bitcoin on itself will never be capable of, and will allow you to aggregate your transactions so that they are several orders of magnitude cheaper.

The incentive for nodes is not financial.  It's control.  That's what nodes get instead of a financial incentive.  We get control over the consensus rules, the transaction type, the Proof-of-Work algorithm, the size of the blockchain.  Basically everything.
What miners get, is an incentive to order transactions in blocks, where they compete for fees and block-rewards to serve the nodes, and through them, the users.  In order for miners to control bitcoin, they would have to change the consensus rules, which they cannot do.
Nodes would have to accept changes to the bitcoin network, or the miners that enforce it would fork themselves off.  And the miners that would remain would have access to more block rewards, and more transaction fees. 
The question is whether we, the users, actually care enough about the extra functionality of bitcoin to bring the miners along.  How do we, as the owners of bitcoin, ensure that the miners are not unduly punished for protocol changes that they have no control over.  Up until now, miners have not resisted changes to the protocol.  They may actually have valid reasons for not wanting to upgrade.  The question we need to ask ourselves is how we overcome their inability to update the clients, and still arrive at the functionality we desire.
That's the discussion we are having now.

But bitcoin?  No.
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:09:20
That's actually a difficult question.  There are two things happening right now that are only tangentially related.  There are the users of bitcoin not being able to upgrade bitcoin with changes that are overwhelmingly supported by the users, because of a miner.  And there is a miner that is getting more and more centralized mining power.  UASF can solve the first one.  But the other one is far trickier.
The only thing that really makes sense to me is the fact that segwit and lightning adds privacy elements to bitcoin that will ensure that the genie never gets put back in the bottle.  I would be assuming that the chinese government is very much against these changes, for reasons that should seem very obvious.
The question is whether bitmain is going to use the first to push in the second.  Because with UASF, the users of bitcoin enforce a block-size increase and privacy improvements, and miners will either upgrade their clients to run core software, or at least run border nodes, or they'll find they're forked off of the network.  If bitmain chooses to fork-off, good luck to them.  Everyone enjoy your new china-coin.  I'll just keep using bitcoin thanks.
The question is whether bitmain decides to attack the network that they've forked from.  If they do, core will implement an emergency PoW change, and you get the same outcome.  Bitmain serving china-coin, and new miners building blocks again.
But truthfully, that just kicks the can down the road.  The reality is, there isn't a solution that we know of right now to solve miner centralization once and for all.  That exact issue is what would be taxing the thoughts of most core developers that are concerned about centralization issues.  Perhaps that solution might be available when and if a PoW change is forced upon us because of bitmain.  Perhaps it won't.
Bitcoin holds all of the bullets in the gun right now.  But no-one wants a fork.  Hopefully, UASF goes through, and in the meantime someone, whether it is core or someone else, can introduce a method or solution that will reduce the centralization that is currently affecting bitcoin.  But there's really going to be no overnight solution.  If bitmain forces the issue, they'll get forked off the network, and more-than-likely will become a state-sponsored china-coin.  But even then, that doesn't solve the problem in bitcoin.  The centralization issues aren't the same with a company like bitfury, but centralization is centralization.  I'm hoping we can develop a solution that doesn't punish miners, but I don't know what that solution is long term.  I'm not sure anyone does.

Emergent consensus, the block-size setting mechanism in ChinaBU, lets miners decide, through force of hash, the block size. This provides for them an incentive such that, as they increase the block-size, it leads to the nodes not being able to be run except with massive connections to the other nodes and miners. The miners that are closer (in bandwidth) to the other nodes, will have more time to retrieve the transaction and block data. Nodes and miners on slower connections will further deplete, as they can't source the data fast enough. This will also mean that communication between miners will favor miners that are closer together.
This means, by design, bitmain will be able to force ALL miners and ALL nodes off of the network, and every node and every miner will be housed in bitmain data-centers.
I'm sure bitmain would like to be the single miner, and the single node provider of bitcoin. But I'm not interested in bitcoin becoming china-coin thanks.

For the **millionth** time, segwit is a block-size increase.
We're not in a stale-mate.  We're in a position in which a miner, bitmain, has announced its intention to attack bitcoin, and delay the introduction of privacy and scalability improvements.  Until this occurred, no-one really knew that that was their intention.  Now we do.  There are several reasons why they could want to do this, none of which are good.
Segwit is deployed to almost all nodes, and most other infrastructure, and now the investigation is underway to develop a good and safe method that the users of bitcoin may use to ensure miners don't continue to block privacy and scalability.  An example of this would be a system like UASF.  
Until such a time as that is complete, or an equivalent, bitcoin goes from strength-to-strength, with more updates to the client software, and more efficiency gains in using it.
It is a false narrative that bitcoin development has stalled perpetuated by people who want to force a change that the users of the network don't want.  The ChinaBU attack has stalled, except for the continued and escalating attack by bitmain, but that's a completely different thing.  If they really had any strength, they'd produce &gt;1MB blocks, and let people follow china-coin if they want to.  All it is showing is that bitmain isn't even using ChinaBU, they're using core, otherwise they'd be continually forking themselves from the network.

Incorrect.  I just explained how what you described is not required and how you'd protect yourself (if you were a miner) from malicious miners.  Something they already need to do if they aren't running current software.  You think bitmain isn't behind bridging nodes?  Ha!
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:54:16
Emergent consensus lets miners decide, through force of hash, the block size.  This provides for them an incentive such that, as they increase the block-size, it leads to the nodes not being able to be run except with massive connections to the other nodes and miners.  The miners that are closer (in bandwidth) to the other nodes, will have more time to retrieve the transaction and block data.  Nodes and miners on slower connections will further deplete, as they can't source the data fast enough.  This will also mean that communication between miners will favor miners that are closer together.
By agreeing to provide high-quality bandwidth between these centralized nodes, it provides a further incentive to centralize.  In effect, if you aren't connected to them, you're not going to be able to be a node, or a miner.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:26:20
Incorrect.  All nodes would accept segwit transactions, even the very old ones.  Miners would not know the difference, and they would create blocks with segwit transactions in them.  The bitcoin network itself is not doing this, because there is an agreement that they won't send these transactions to miners until 95% have signaled readiness.  But that is a convention.  There's no reason why nodes couldn't switch on these functions if they were so inclined.  The only effect on this would be that miners then need protect themselves from malicious miners.  Which they already need to do.

This will also mean that communication between miners will favor miners that are closer together.
This means, by design, bitmain will be able to force ALL miners and ALL nodes off of the network, and every node and every miner will be housed in bitmain data-centers.
I'm sure bitmain would like to be the single miner, and the single node provider of bitcoin. But I'm not interested in bitcoin becoming china-coin thanks.  That's what ChinaBU does.  And it is mostly people who are ignorant of how bitcoin works that are cheering for it.


It over doubles capacity and is available the instant it is activated.  There are already implementations of the lightning network on the main-net, and the only thing they're waiting for is the malleability fix that segwit provides.  That's thousands of transactions a second.  All being blocked by bitmain, and chinese miner, for the reasons stated above.  Cheered on by people such as yourself.


And here you start again in with your hyperbole.  Just stop it.  I've already answered these questions, and you're making the same blanket statements based upon ignorance again.
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:08:24

Oh, and you should see it.  The segwit nodecount has been steadily climbing since bitmain announced their intention to attack bitcoin.  The people who use bitcoin know how to protect themselves from malicious miners.
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:23:48
You don't know what consensus means. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:50:34
Right. So let's start. What you need to stop doing, is thinking you should have any opinion at all, until you know what you're talking about. It's not opinion first, justification later. It's justification first, opinion later. Try it.
So. Lightning. Lightning allows users to take a single bitcoin transaction, and use it over a finite space of time, in order to shift bitcoin back and forth, with no or vanishingly small transaction fees, as iou's between what's are called 'lightning channels'. The actual transaction size will be the same as a normal transaction, with a flag that says it can only be committed to the blockchain at a specific time (or block depth). In effect, these lightning transactions are cryptographically signed 'iou's. The 'thousands' of back-and-forth iou changes are discarded when the channel is closed (massive privacy dividend), and only the aggregated change is committed to the blockchain. This is the great thing about lightning. It is a single transaction with as many inputs and outputs (one/two) as defined in the original transaction. Only the transaction values change.
Consider a channel link of this : John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne. Only the people next to each people in the chain have a 'channel open' with each other (John/Bob, Bob/Sally, Sally/Anne). Assuming each of the channels between all of the participants have adequate funds in order to achieve this, if John wanted to send 1btc to Anne. A transaction ledger would read :
John-&gt;Bob channel : John -1btc, Bob +1btc
Bob-&gt;Sally channel : Bob -1btc, Sally +1btc
Sally-&gt;Anne channel : Sally -1btc, Anne +1btc.
Anne now has 1btc more, and John has 1btc less, but the net effect in each channel is simply a modification to the distribution of bitcoin in that channel.
Imagine this happening, back and forth, and extended to thousands, tens of thousands, and millions of people. As long as there's a chain between them, you use the chain. You might even have your transaction split over multiple chains. For links that don't have a chain, you create a channel on-the-fly.
Each channel, therefore, only ends up with the same single input, and the same two outputs, just differing values.
It's significantly more complex than that (transaction routing, and channel closure mechanics), but that's the idea. I wish I could remember the lightning dev that explained it. It really is very clever. I haven't actually questioned about the effect of having channels with multiple inputs (John/Sally) and outputs (Bob/Anne) at inception. Technically, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible. Just a much weirder set of ramifications.
So THAT is a bitcoin scalability solution. THAT is what segwit enables. INCLUDING a block size increase, and the other bug fixes.

?  No.
The miners can decide to fork, but they have to decide to do it.  And it is in the miners best interests to ensure they're protecting themselves from malicious miners too (you know, from people like themselves).  This has never been different.
But UASF doesn't lead to a fork unless one of two conditions is met.
1. A miner decides to fork.
2. A miner doesn't protect themselves from a malicious miner forking, and builds on a corrupt block.
When you understand that those are the only two circumstances under which this can occur, you recognize that it isn't UASF that's an issue, it's miners, and you develop a solution accordingly.
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:22:10

You fkn moron.  How about you use the full quote from satoshi :


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




Nodes are the agents in a multi-agent system enforcing consensus.
Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, validate the transactions, replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks, replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.

What the hell does 'confirm' mean?  ffs.  Nodes validate.  That's what they do.  They accept transactions.  They validate transactions.  They propagate transactions.  They provide a pool of valid transactions that miners may access.  They validate blocks.  They propagate blocks.  They propagate the blockchain.  They validate transactions within blocks.  They enforce consensus rules.
That is what nodes do.  The fact that you don't know this and want to continue arguing when there is not a single person that understands bitcoin that would agree with you is hilariously incompetent.

And that is why I posted the comment about nodes and consensus.  Because you clearly don't know how bitcoin works.  Here, let me do it again.  Try a bit harder this time to understand what's going on.
Nodes are nodes.  Nodes validate.  All of them do.  It's what they do.


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




Nodes are the agents in a multi-agent system enforcing consensus.
Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, validate the transactions, replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks, replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.

@_date: 2017-03-05 02:51:58


Nodes enforce consensus, not miners.  If they try and continue to create blocks on an old chain after a valid block has been accepted by the nodes, they only burn their wheels until they start building on the chain accepted by the nodes.  It is, indeed, one of the very mechanisms that makes UASF work, and why the longest chain will always be the one that the nodes support.
Seriously dude... you're grasping at straws here.

@_date: 2017-03-20 08:07:52
Nodes that don't handle transactions are immaterial to this discussion. As long as people who are using bitcoin are using core nodes to sign and accept transactions, the core rules apply to all of those transactions. 97% of nodes do this, and every node that manages transactions probably does too, and that includes the nodes being run by miners that are signalling ChinaBU.
If Bitmain attacks the bitcoin blockchain after they fork, every one of those users will no longer be able to create transactions, so they will have to upgrade to a new client with a new PoW in order to continue using bitcoin. And when they do that, it goes back to normal, except the hundreds of millions of dollars that have been spent on ASIC miners will be immediately rendered obsolete.

80% of nodes have already updated to segwit aware clients.  UASF requires nodes that create and accept transactions to upgrade to UASF enabled clients.

They're people that are almost exclusively loud, ignorant, and dogmatic.  Almost every person you find people that knows how bitcoin works, is not like you.  I don't get it.  The resources to understand are there, and the entire project is open-source.  There are experts that will answer your questions.  How do I know?  Because they answered my questions.  But you choose that path of ignorance, when the easy path of understanding is in front of you.  Is it america?  Is it your education?  Is it because english is a second language?  Is it because you don't know how to program?  That's the stuff I don't know.  Bitcoin?  Complex but not that difficult to understand as a concept once you understand how it is structured.

We'll see if it gains acceptance.  
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:49:54
Completely incorrect.  No-one is forcing people to use layer-2 networks when they are implemented. People are prepared to pay fees right now for the network to function as it is, and mining clearly pays, or there wouldn't be hundreds of millions of dollars spent on it.
So if you want to have cheap fees with instantaneous confirmations, and use a layer-2, go for it.  No-one is forcing you.  If you want to continue paying fees using the block-chain directly instead of aggregating your transactions before committing them, go for it.  No-one is forcing you.
And you know what happens?  It becomes more valuable, because more people can use it for more use-cases, so the price goes up, which means miners earn more.  And all done without affecting the security of the network and decentralization.  Win fucking win fucking win fucking win.
You really haven't thought this through.

Who said I was here to answer your questions?  I've stated my position very plainly.


And I explained why : It wasn't necessary to have the blocksize increase with SegWit. The re-organization could have been handled just as easily with both the witness and non-witness data included without increasing the blocksize, **and it STILL would have had the malleability fix and been a better solution to the abortion that is ChinaBU and emergent consensus.**
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:40:41
From my understanding, it's not that it is a bundle of fixes in a package called segwit.  It is the fact that segwit is the solution to the malleability problem because of the restructure of the block that separates witness data.  It's like saying : I'd like to have strawberry ice-cream, but i don't want it to taste like strawberry. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 02:00:21


You think.  But hey, that's funny.  Because one of the numpty arguments against segwit is that segwit will mean more transactions, so miners will lose money.
But it's good to highlight utility.  The utility of the lightning network far exceeds the utility of a block-size increase.

97% core nodes, 83% already segwit enabled. We have consensus.
This is what happens when UASF happens.  Bitmain loses their ability to block scalability anymore.  A so sad.  Let's recap : Bitmain is in no position to negotiate anything. It is signal segwit, or have it implemented anyway through a USAF type mechanism. Hard-fork if you don't want follow the soft-fork. PoW change if you attack the bitcoin blockchain after the fork.
In other words, do your job or you're fired.
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:20:47
Miners, or mainly one miner, the biggest one, bitmain, are blocking the upgrade to an increase in blocksize and malleability fix.  That's segwit.  What they're blocking.  They're saying they want to run bitcoin out of their data-centers, and if they don't get what they want, they'll block all upgrades.

@_date: 2017-03-14 08:50:27
It's not up to the users to ensure miners protect themselves from other miners.  It's up to us, the users, to protect ourselves from miners.  I don't have any sympathy for a miner that gets corrupted by another miner because they don't take the time to set up a bridge node.  They already do this.  They're earning block rewards.  They should treat being a miner as the business it is.  If they choose to not do it out of spite, I have little sympathy for them at all.  
But with a UASF, because the nodes that are accepting and broadcasting transactions are segwit aware (80% of nodes and counting), they'll reject those blocks with malicious miner transactions.   That'll be 90-95 by the time it is activated.  The only people who are affected are miners that don't protect themselves.  They'll get forked off never to be heard from again.  Good riddance I say.

@_date: 2017-03-10 01:00:39
Nodes check. They get their txns from nodes.  Every miner has a node that they configure and get their txns from.  There is no exception to this. Many times they do blindly create a blockwith just the header information. 
We are talking about the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:22:46

It doesn't matter what you want.  That's the beauty of ChinaBU.  Just gradually increase the block-size, and gradually force nodes off of the network.  Easy-Peasy.
By design.


But it won't.  Because as block sizes increase, the nodes that couldn't handle them will be removed, allowing further increases.
By design.


Which would require the nodes that no-longer exist, and the miners that no-longer exist, to activate it.  
Well gamed.  Good work china-coin.
@_date: 2017-03-24 11:16:59

Or he is the brainwasher.  
Wu clearly sees the writing on the wall with [UASF]( or some variant of it.  This is his last-ditch effort to wrest control of bitcoin before the opportunity is taken away from him forever.  He doesn't want scalability.  He wants the emergent consensus mechanism that allows a club of miners to force nodes and miners off of the network.
Wu wants to own the blockchain.  He thought he could do it by a back-door, and that seems not to be working.  Now he's trying to get people to support his efforts.

Yes.  It's called 'validation'.  It is what nodes do.  It is what every node does.  It is their only reason for existence.  Every node does it to every transaction in their mempool, every block that is propagated through the network, and every transaction in every one of those blocks.  They do it to every transaction since genesis block.  That's why it takes so long for them to 'sync' with the network.
You know... bitcoin.  That's how it works.  You can [download the node client]( and do it yourself.


@_date: 2017-03-20 08:07:12

So basically, what you're saying is, you don't know.  Now there's a surprise.  rbtc sockpuppet numpty talking out of his ass about subjects of which he knows nothing.
So. Lightning. Lightning allows users to take a single bitcoin transaction, and use it over a finite space of time, in order to shift bitcoin back and forth, with no or vanishingly small transaction fees, as iou's between what are called 'lightning channels'. The actual transaction size will be the same as a normal transaction, with a flag that says it can only be committed to the blockchain at a specific time (or block depth). In effect, these lightning transactions are cryptographically signed 'iou's. The 'thousands' of back-and-forth iou changes are discarded when the channel is closed (massive privacy dividend), and only the aggregated change is committed to the blockchain. This is the great thing about lightning. It is a single transaction with as many inputs and outputs (one/two) as defined in the original transaction. Only the transaction values change.
Consider a channel link of this : John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne. Only the people next to each people in the chain have a 'channel open' with each other (John/Bob, Bob/Sally, Sally/Anne). Assuming each of the channels between all of the participants have adequate funds in order to achieve this, if John wanted to send 1btc to Anne. A transaction ledger would read :
John-&gt;Bob channel : John -1btc, Bob +1btc
Bob-&gt;Sally channel : Bob -1btc, Sally +1btc
Sally-&gt;Anne channel : Sally -1btc, Anne +1btc.
Anne now has 1btc more, and John has 1btc less, but the net effect in each channel is simply a modification to the distribution of bitcoin in that channel.
Imagine this happening, back and forth, and extended to thousands, tens of thousands, and millions of people. As long as there's a chain between them, you use the chain. You might even have your transaction split over multiple chains. For links that don't have a chain, you create a channel on-the-fly.
Each channel, therefore, only ends up with the same single input, and the same two outputs, just differing values.
It's significantly more complex than that (transaction routing, and channel closure mechanics), but that's the idea. I wish I could remember the lightning dev that explained it. It really is very clever. I haven't actually questioned about the effect of having channels with multiple inputs (John/Sally) and outputs (Bob/Anne) at inception. Technically, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible. Just a much weirder set of ramifications.
So THAT is a bitcoin scalability solution. THAT is what segwit enables. INCLUDING a block size increase, and the other bug fixes.

I think you need to learn how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-03-15 06:48:21
Eventually, nodes become so wide-spread, that you effectively can't upgrade the consensus rules, because you will never be able to get enough support to change their clients.  The only thing you can do until such a time, is to highlight any issues that you see, and alert potential client-users of issues with a given client.
In the end, you as a developer can't tell the users what to do any more than a miner can.  If enough users want to change the system, the system will change.  You can try and protect people by keeping them informed, but bitcoin is opt-in.  Users will do what users want to do.

Emergent consensus let's them set consensus rules.  They can steal your coins, create new ones, up the coin limit.  Anything.  That's what changing consensus means.  Changing those rules.  That's what emergent consensus does.  Lets miners force off the nodes of the network that enforce those rules.

It is not.  The users aren't splitting.  It is only a hard-fork if the miners choose to go their own way, and don't create blocks to the requirements of the nodes.  They have always had the ability to fork.  They could do it today.
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:27:00
Only people who want to break bitcoin want a hard-fork.  It is not necessary.  There is a soft-fork solution available right now that increases the block-size, and provides real solutions to scalability because of fixes like the malleability fix.
The fact is, the people blocking segwit, are the people blocking scalability.  Once you understand that, you'll better understand their motivations.

The only reason this discussion is even happening is because a single company, bitmain, a company in a totalitarian country, is blocking progress that the USERS want to have.  
No-one is forcing anyone to upgrade their nodes to segwit enabled clients.  In spite of that reality, 80% of users have upgraded to segwit aware clients and 97% of users use core clients.  No-one took a gun to anyones head and said upgrade.
The same thing can't be said of bitmain.
@_date: 2017-03-04 18:10:28


Which it won't be because only segwit miners can create segwit blocks, and they're valid. 


Which they can't see and can't add to blocks. 


If it is not a valid txn it will reject it.  If it is a segwit txn it won't even see it. 
Seriously dude.  Fkn snookered!!!
@_date: 2017-03-13 01:49:49
That doesn't change the fact that no one is forcing miners to mine segwit blocks. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 07:26:51


Old miners are unaffected.  Old miners will see segwit txns, and accept them.  They'll see non-segwit txns, and accept them.  It is the nodes that validate if they're valid txns or not.  So old miners are completely unaffected by a UASF upgrade, unless malicious miners create malicious blocks with malicious transactions, and the older miners don't retrieve their transactions through a bridging node, or from a segwit enabled node.  But miners have had to worry about this outcome for some time because malicious miners can already attack other miners in this method.  Which is why they use bridging nodes in the first place.
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:15:10

Immaterial.  It is whether they all have the same consensus rules that matters.  They've broken that trust.  You have no idea what rules they're going to follow, and you will only find out later what you've agreed to, or which consensus rules you're now following.
@_date: 2017-03-02 03:04:23


Yes.  You've forked you.  Congratulations.  Just like ChinaBU did the other day by creating an invalid block.  No-one builds on their chain, though, do they?  Remember?  Because the nodes themselves reject them.  Just like the ChinaBU non-consensus block they created.  Miners who use shitty node clients that aren't aware of consensus rules deserve what's coming to them.  Just like ChinaBU.  


Which it wouldn't be.  As long as you obey the consensus rules, it will not matter whether it is full of segwit transactions, or non-segwit transactions.  The point.  The nodes know what to do with old block and transaction data.  The point.
So no fork.

And that those nice miners won't take advantage of their fat big pipes between the nodes they control to force nodes and miners off of the network.  Because they're nice or some shit. 
Which is why the largest miner, which happens to be located in a totalitarian country, loves it.  They love the idea of china-coin

Let's be honest, it doesn't hurt.  Yes, you are right.  But in the end, nodes that even relay and, more importantly, reject invalid, blocks, are also worth having.  But yes, the most important things nodes are for, is being used for creating and receiving transactions.

Nothing.  This is a defensive measure to ensure that bitmain can't attack the network after they initiate a fork, which has repeatedly been a stated intention.  
I would prefer no fork.  But if bitmain attacks bitcoin, there's one thing that nodes do that they have no control over, and that's setting the PoW.  The guys from bitfury should be explaining the dynamics of who loses in this situation to bitmain.

Seriously dude, you should ask the simple question "What do miners do?" if you want to increase your understanding, because it's woefully lacking.
Nodes enforce consensus rules.  That's what they do.  It is really their reason for existence.
Miners order valid transactions (defined by the nodes) by hashing transactions they select, and they provide a service to the network by making it infeasible to reverse transactions.  They do this by hashing the transactions to an algorithm that will produce a hash that meets a specific output parameter, and then they pass the block that meets that requirement to the nodes for validation.  The node then validates that block (two validations, txn first, then block after mining), and if it is valid, includes it to the blockchain.  It then replicates the block to other nodes, so that they are informed that they need to remove the transactions that have been included in the block from their mempool, and to move on to the next block of transactions.  Each node that it is replicated to ALSO validates the block, and all of the transactions in it.  
So every node validates every block and every transaction.
It is YOUR lack of understanding that is being displayed here.  For the last few hours, I've had you [trying to laugh at my understanding of bitcoin]( because you don't know what a node and miner does. Just stop it.

@_date: 2017-03-14 05:42:24
Which is no different today.
The miners can decide to fork, but they have to decide to do it.  And it is in the miners best interests to ensure they're protecting themselves from malicious miners too.  You think that it should be up to other people to protect you when they've already given you the tools to do so?
But UASF doesn't lead to a fork unless one of two conditions is met.
1. A miner decides to fork.
2. A miner doesn't protect themselves from a malicious miner forking, and builds on a corrupt block.
When you understand that those are the only two circumstances under which this can occur, you recognize that it isn't UASF that's an issue, it's miners, and you develop a solution accordingly.
@_date: 2017-03-13 06:45:58
So?  If a user accepts txn without confirmation and assumes that it has been added to a block, they get what's coming to them.  This is the double-spend problem.  This is why you wait for confirmation.  This is about a user of bitcoin making a double-spend, and teaming up with a miner to include it in a block. 
So no.  You are wrong.
If miners really had the power that you say they have, they would be able to use this attack on transactions that happened 10 blocks ago.
But I agree about one thing.  Malicious miners are an issue.  Some, especially bitmain, based in china, is one such malicious miner.  That's why we're having to develop a solution to their attack on the bitcoin network.  Which is what this proposal is all about.

But they don't.  He's against segwit because it means he won't get the emergent consensus mechanism that will allow him and a club of other miners to force nodes and miners off of the network.  It's a hostile take-over of bitcoin, and he sees the opportunity slipping through his fingers.

@_date: 2017-03-20 13:01:31
Nodes are nodes.  Nodes validate.  All of them do.  It's what they do.


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




Nodes are the agents in a multi-agent system enforcing consensus.
Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, validate the transactions, replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks, replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.

LN does not require trust.
LN uses the LOCK feature of bitcoin, such that a payment channel doesn't disperse the blockchain funds until the completion of the channel.  In that final completion, the actual amounts dispersed to the two parties, is defined by the number of back-and-forth transactions that have taken place in the channel.
You've missed a step in that procedure.  In order for a txn to be a valid LN txn, Alice must send back Bob a cryptographic proof that she has accepted the txn.  Both must send that proof to each other, and only Alice and Bob can do this, so Bob owning that proof is proof that the txn has occurred.  The Channel itself becomes a ledger of iou's back and forth between Alice and Bob, where each new entry has an agreed value exchange, and proof that both Bob and Alice have agreed to the exchange.  If Alice says Bob didn't give him the money, and Bob shows the proof that he did, the entire contents of the channel get sent to the person with the valid proof.  Thus there is an incentive to do the right thing, because if you don't, the funds get sent to the other party.
I think I have that right.

Mining isn't free.  It will never be free.  It never was free.  That energy costs money, and transaction fees are the thing that pays for it.  Lightning means you don't need to rely upon that infrastructure as often because transactions are aggregated until they are committed.
What it is, is an efficient use of technology, to reduce the effect of a constraint, without affecting bitcoins core use-case : Censorship resistance and decentralization.  (and of course, being deflationary)

If they are attacking, they will create blocks with no transactions on the old rules, but will not allow any transactions from the core nodes, and they will orphan the block of any miner that includes core node transactions.

Another numpty that doesn't know how bitcoin works. 
None of you fn numpties even know what ChinaBU does.
Emergent consensus lets miners decide, through force of hash, the block size. This provides for them an incentive such that, as they increase the block-size, it leads to the nodes not being able to be run except with massive connections to the other nodes and miners. The miners that are closer (in bandwidth) to the other nodes, will have more time to retrieve the transaction and block data. Nodes and miners on slower connections will further deplete, as they can't source the data fast enough. This will also mean that communication between miners will favor miners that are closer together.
This means, by design, bitmain will be able to force ALL miners and ALL nodes off of the network, and every node and every miner will be housed in bitmain data-centers.

If Bitmain wants to fork, nothing is stopping them doing that now. But it isn't going to be caused by UASF, because there's no way that it can cause a fork.   And no amount is squealing is going to change that. 
What UASF does is remove the ability of Bitmain to veto segwit.  If users want it, it's going to happen.  And all it is going to take is core nodes with UASF enabled and a nominal set of miners.  Old nodes won't even see segwit txns or segwit blocks until they're building on top of them in the blockchain.

Proof of strategy to turn bitcoin into china-coin.
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:03:42
Incorrect.  If it was possible to do what you say to 'spin up nodes to change consensus rules', why haven't miners already done it?  They haven't, have they?  How do you get coinbase to accept your new consensus rules eh?  They're running a different set of rules, because they don't care about your node with its rules they don't like.  Ditto for electrum.  Ditto for mycelium.  Ditto for poloniex.  Ditto for everyone.
So you can 'spin up' as many nodes as you like.  If you don't get the nodes that people actually use for using bitcoin, you can have 10 million nodes, and it won't make one jot of difference.
Knowing this, you know that nodes, in fact, define consensus rules.  Every node validates every transaction, every block, and every transaction in every block.
So now we know this, when already 80% of nodes have updated to segwit, how do we bring along miners, or indeed, do we even attempt to bring them along at all.

They could be just looking for listening nodes.  Then the numbers are out, but not that far out.  They could be looking for nodes that are both listening and archival.  That'd probably start getting close.

They can attempt a fork with whatever hashpower they have.


bitcoin.com is, and that's why they've produced &gt;1MB blocks and been forked off the network for their trouble.  That's the emergent consensus algorithm producing a block &gt;1MB.  If bitmain were doing the same thing, and given they have about 20x the hash-power of bitcoin.com, they'd be forking the coin daily.

Every miner has always needed a node to send their newly hashed block to.  The nodes haven't changed their definition.  Any node can do it.  That's what they do.  Validate blocks, whether they come from a miner or any other node.  That's why satoshi called them nodes, and that's why they continue to be nodes.

Why would I want to punish all miners for the acts of bitmain?  UASF will allow miners to select exactly which type of transactions they would like to include in their blocks.  Just like now.  They just won't be able to select which transactions can be included in other miners blocks.  And nodes define consensus rules, so.... everyone wins.  If no miners nor no users want to use the segwit features, it's the same as before.  If users want to, and no miners do, the users are flat-out of luck.  No miner will be forced to include them, and no user will be forced to not create transactions just because miners they never want to use don't want them to, unless no miners at all are willing to include them.
The only people who lose, are miners that are using the hash to deny bitcoin users the right to use the network as they please, so long as consensus is maintained between the nodes used by people who use bitcoin.

I know exactly how a 51% attack works.  Unlike you, I also know how a node works.  And because you don't know how a node works, you don't know how UASF works.  And because you don't know how a node works, you don't know what nodes can do to combat a 51% attack.  And BTW, what you think a 51% attack is, isn't what is explained there.  Miners can already choose which transactions they want to include in a block.  But if they tried to only build on top of blocks that have already been approved by the nodes, they'd be forked.
But about a 51% attack. And make no mistake about it, it would be an attack.  And make no mistake about it, nodes have the ability to fight off this attack.  That's because, unlike you, everyone has known about this attack vector since the system was designed, because everyone knows that miners attacking the network is the most likely attack vector for cashed up attackers.  But you wouldn't know that, because you don't know how a node works.  If a miner ever committed to a  51% attack, the nodes would go nuclear and change the [POW]( and presto, gone, all of the miners.  Every single one.  Switch over to [keccak miners]( (or others, like [this]( [this]( [this]( [this]( or [this]( and you suddenly have an entirely new mining pool mining bitcoin, and the hundreds of millions of dollars of current bitcoin mining hardware is stranded.  Poof!  All gone. Because the nodes control bitcoin, and specifically the nodes that manage incoming transactions, not the miners.  That's the reality of bitmains position, and the reality of why he dares not demonstrate how much mining power he actually has.  Because if he ever did (which I don't think he'll ever do), he knows the hundreds of millions he's borrowed to build the mining infrastructure, will be extinguished overnight, and he's likely to be led out into a paddy field by the people he owes hundreds of millions of dollars to, and be delivered a bullet in the back of the head.

Clearly not.
Nodes are nodes.  Nodes validate.  All of them do.  It's what they do.


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks, replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.

It's the nuclear option, but there's no way that that doesn't end up with two chains.  The UASF proposal still has one chain, but miners can't veto the introduction of functionality that the users, through the nodes, want.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:24:08
My thought-bubble.  I'm trying to get input : 
PKI Mining and Node relay.  (Public Key Infrastructure Mining and Node Relay)
Would it be possible to add an encryption key to a txn that signals that you will only allow miners that have the key to mine your txns?  This then might be solved as a configuration setting on the nodes :
  1. Accept/relay all txns.
  2. Key management solution within client that allows me to select from a list of miners that I, as a user, find acceptable. 
  3. I accept/relay txns that meet a library of keys (white-list). 
  4. Reject txns that meet a library of keys (black-list).
The immediate issue is that your txn would need to have several keys, for the list of pools/miners that you would be prepared to use to include your txns in a blocks. I'm thinking that there needs to be some method using nodes to re-direct around hostile miners, to miners that meet your requirements. GnuPGP provides the facility for using multiple keys to encrypt the same key.  The miner defines a private key, generates a public key from that private key, and the user encrypts their transaction using the private key(s) of their choice.
This might not even be handled in any other way than a 'handshake' between nodes.  When a node connects to another node, it passes along its white-list.  Perhaps its black-list too, but not necessary.  The node it has connected to can then replicate the transactions that meet the list.  The node then weeds out the transactions that meet its black-list.
So how would a node perform its validation function with some or all of the content of txn encrypted?  Would it be possible to use the public key of one of the encryption keys in order to do a blind validation?  I can't see how that would work.  Does anyone know of a model that would allow this?
The reason I like this type of option is that it is opt-in, which satisfies the ethos of bitcoin. Then there is incentive for miners to 'do the right thing' and be an accepted miner. You can have white-lists, and black-lists, managed by the user. But it also might give you control, as a node owner, to decide which txns destined to which miner are relayed through your node.  I don't want my node to be used to relay transactions to that miner.  I think it would also encourage for there to be more nodes.
This entire system doesn't deal with block propagation, so I think it would have a negligible effect on traffic.
But you'd also need to be able to remove transactions from your pool if they are in the block. So it sounds like you wouldn't be able to use encrypt all of the data, just some of it. Enough so you couldn't mine it, but not enough so that you couldn't identify it.
Definitely more cpu processing time though.
Reckon you could do it by making a hash of your transaction details, and then referencing that vs a hash of each of the transactions in the new block.  Compare the two, and you'll know you can remove the transactions in the block with matching hashes.  So whether all of the txn was encrypted or not, the hash is a header field that isn't.  This would allow you to remove transactions in your pool when a new block confirms that they have been included in a block.
Think I might even be over-thinking the validation part.  There are two validations.  One of the txn, and one of the txn in a block.  The second one isn't affected by this process.  The first one is.  BUT.  Do I care about the first one much?  The miner still has that key.  They can decrypt the txns they have, validate them, and therefore include them in blocks.  So the issue doesn't become is it validated, but of incentives.
Validation would still be issue for txn at node though.  Spam.  Adversarial users could create transactions that clog nodes that will never be included in blocks.  If the transaction is invalid, but the relaying node can't validate it, they'd be replicating it to all of the nodes  You'd need to have some method of making the user has to pay for this type of transaction.  So they lose money the more of them that they create.
@_date: 2016-03-05 07:34:57


Let's just clear that up.  Development and testing is already underway.


No we're not, as the low-fee spam-attack proved.  Hey, I don't think everyone has all of the answers.  Segwit is going to reduce congestion, and the jury is still out on whether that will suffice.  If a standard fee transaction starts pushing up to about 25c, I think you'll start to see a recognition that the block-size increase is suitable.  By that time (probably about 12-18 months) the hard-fork will have been implemented as an option within core.
Maybe that's going to be required, maybe it won't.  I actually reckon it's about 50/50.  Many of the issues that face a hard-fork now will be resolved by then though.

@_date: 2017-03-05 13:26:34


Incorrect.  I'll explain why.
There are always miners.  Even if 50% of the miners, or 75%, were forked off of the network the remaining miners would still be ordering transactions, and placing them in blocks, and giving them to nodes, so they will still be replicated to the network.  The only thing that would happen if even 75% of the miners were forked off of the network, would be that block creation times would average 40 minutes instead of 10 minutes, until the difficulty re-adjustment occurred, which would be anywhere from zero to 2016 blocks.  Instead of a regular epoch, that would be be roughly zero to 14 days, it would be zero to 56 days.  After that epoch, the difficulty would re-adjust, and we'd be back to 10 minutes.  We'd be back to 10 minute blocks using 25% of the miners.


Because you repeatedly said something that was false, and even when you were confronted with information that plainly demonstrated that this was the case, instead of attempting to understand the information, you doubled-down, and continued on with the falsehoods.  
When I learn something that I didn't know, even if I argue with people, I give a quick "TIL" (Today I Learned), and then I change my mind, and integrate the new information.
You now know what a node does.  You now know what a miner does.  You might want to take some time to integrate that information and decide whether the previous understandings you had need to be re-analyzed given new information.  What you should never do is continue on as if somehow the information doesn't exist, because the only thing that does is isolate any avenue you have for learning.
It is at this point that I think it is always good to pass on a media article from a philosopher that my partner works with.  While the specifics being argued and the people in question are not really important, the subject matter is.  These words are words to live by.
And now I'm off to bed.  Glad we had this chat!

No argument from me there.


I doubt there would be any.  No-one can know for sure, but if they didn't, all it would mean would be that if there was system interrupt, they would need to download the entire chain again with their node in order download transactions and to validate blocks they create.


The thing is, the node the miner actually connects to is probably a node client specifically created and configured for the miner.  Many miners will start creating blocks based upon the headers of a solved block before the actual block has been relayed.  That would require another method of analyzing a block locally before it has been fully relayed from the node that validated the block first.
Which is why they'd all need to have bridging nodes to ensure other miners aren't feeding them shit.  They might start solving it, but they would still validate the last block to ensure they haven't been duped, and that would require a bridging node.
@_date: 2017-03-02 02:04:50
It is the nodes that define whether miners are honest. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 03:39:21


Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them.  Miners don't.  Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes.  Miners don't.  Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do).  Miners pass the new block to the node.  The node validates the transactions.  Miners don't.  The node validates the block.  Miners don't.  The node replicates the block to other nodes.  Miners don't.
There is only one function that miners do.  They take transactions, put them in a block, and hashes them.  As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks, replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain.  Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.
I think you need to revisit your understanding of bitcoin.  Because it seems to be lacking?
So knowing that it is up to the nodes to decide which miners we want to use to perform the hashing function that is dictated by nodes, how do we go about making sure they're supported as we migrate bitcoin to a more feature rich environment?

Come back when you know what a node does.


- Blocks may only create a certain number of bitcoins. (Currently 12.5 BTC per block.)
- Transactions must have correct signatures for the bitcoins being spent.
- Transactions/blocks must be in the correct data format.
- Within a single block chain, a transaction output cannot be double-spent.






1. The transactions syntax and data structure are correct.
2. The input and outputs have values.
3. The transaction is less than the block size of 1 MB.
4. The values must be more than 0 and less than 21 million.
5. None of the inputs have a hash that is equal to 0.
6. The locktime is less than the maximum allowed number.
7. The transaction size is greater than or equal to 100 bytes.
8. The number of signatures is less than the signatute limit.
9. The unlocking script can only push numbers onto the stack.
10. The locking script must match isstandard format.
11. A matching transaction must exist.
12. If a transaction is missing move the transaction to the orphan transaction pool.
13. If the transaction is a coinbase transaction then it must have a maturity of 100 confirmations.
14. For each input the output must exist and not have been spent.
15. Check that each input value is in the required range.
16. Reject if the input value is less than the output value.
17. Reject if the transaction value is to low to get into an empty block.
18. The unlocking scripts for each input must be verified against the output locking scripts.

Emergent consensus, the block-size setting mechanism in ChinaBU, lets miners decide, through force of hash, the block size. This provides for them an incentive such that, as they increase the block-size, it leads to the nodes not being able to be run except with massive connections to the other nodes and miners. The miners that are closer (in bandwidth) to the other nodes, will have more time to retrieve the transaction and block data. Nodes and miners on slower connections will further deplete, as they can't source the data fast enough. This will also mean that communication between miners will favor miners that are closer together.
This means, by design, bitmain will be able to force ALL miners and ALL nodes off of the network, and every node and every miner will be housed in bitmain data-centers.
I'm sure bitmain would like to be the single miner, and the single node provider of bitcoin. But I'm not interested in bitcoin becoming china-coin thanks.

He has no idea how lightning works.  This is how lightning works.
So. Lightning. Lightning allows users to take a single bitcoin transaction, and use it over a finite space of time, in order to shift bitcoin back and forth, with no or vanishingly small transaction fees, as iou's between what are called 'lightning channels'. The actual transaction size will be the same as a normal transaction, with a flag that says it can only be committed to the blockchain at a specific time (or block depth). In effect, these lightning transactions are cryptographically signed 'iou's. The 'thousands' of back-and-forth iou changes are discarded when the channel is closed (massive privacy dividend), and only the aggregated change is committed to the blockchain. This is the great thing about lightning. It is a single transaction with as many inputs and outputs (one/two) as defined in the original transaction. Only the transaction values change.
Consider a channel link of this : John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne. Only the people next to each people in the chain have a 'channel open' with each other (John/Bob, Bob/Sally, Sally/Anne). Assuming each of the channels between all of the participants have adequate funds in order to achieve this, if John wanted to send 1btc to Anne. A transaction ledger would read :
John-&gt;Bob channel : John -1btc, Bob +1btc
Bob-&gt;Sally channel : Bob -1btc, Sally +1btc
Sally-&gt;Anne channel : Sally -1btc, Anne +1btc.
Anne now has 1btc more, and John has 1btc less, but the net effect in each channel is simply a modification to the distribution of bitcoin in that channel.
Imagine this happening, back and forth, and extended to thousands, tens of thousands, and millions of people. As long as there's a chain between them, you use the chain. You might even have your transaction split over multiple chains. For links that don't have a chain, you create a channel on-the-fly.
Each channel, therefore, only ends up with the same single input, and the same two outputs, just differing values.
It's significantly more complex than that (transaction routing, and channel closure mechanics), but that's the idea. I wish I could remember the lightning dev that explained it. It really is very clever. I haven't actually questioned about the effect of having channels with multiple inputs (John/Sally) and outputs (Bob/Anne) at inception. Technically, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible. Just a much weirder set of ramifications.
So THAT is a bitcoin scalability solution. THAT is what segwit enables. INCLUDING a block size increase, and the other bug fixes. 
What it requires is the malleability fix that is included in segwit.

It's not a block-chain solution, but it is definitely a transaction scaling solution.  I don't like it personally.  But it can be used to divert transactions onto different infrastructure.


There's nothing 'simple' about that non-scaling solution.

It's OK guys!  Australian people don't need to validate their own bitcoin transactions.  said it's ok.  Thats a relief. 
My position is that any change to bitcoin that increases centralization is bad.  It is only because of the malleability fix and the quadratic hashing fix in segwit that it has any support at all, or it would have suffered the same fate as xt, classic, and bu.  The only reason that bu has any 'support' is because a small cabal of Chinese miners are trying to steal bitcoin control from the users.

@_date: 2017-03-04 13:36:08
Just reading about that in the slack, and it seems that minority hash is not a 'major' concern.  More the better, but not a major issue.  For miners that don't want to attack the network, they can continue carrying on not mining segwit blocks with non-updated clients.  As long as they don't attempt to create &gt;1MB blocks, no split problem.  This is no different to today.
From what I understand, there are only two methods that lead to a fork, and that's if they attempt to implement a non-consensus block (same as today), or that they accept a non-valid segwit transaction and include it in a block.  If they don't build on that block, the offending block will be treated like an orphan block.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:41:07


No I'm not.  I already answered this question in the above post.  As long as they continue getting their transactions from, or through, nodes that have validated them appropriately, they can build whichever block type they want.


They'll only be able to provide hashing if they provide blocks that meet consensus rules.  And after the difficulty rate re-set, it'll be back to the same if they choose not to do so.
If they want to fork, they fork.  If they don't want to protect themselves from malicious miners out of blind spite, they fork.  Bitcoin remains unaffected.

I just think it's an important distinction to make.  The reason I think so, is because people say regularly : It's a spam filter that is no longer relevant!  Remove it!  
But because he never actually let anyone know exactly why he did it, he could very well have recognized way way back then, that increasing it beyond the value that he set it at, would lead to the centralization of nodes because of upload bandwidth requirements.  We don't know.
Unless you know the reasons why it was introduced, you can't justify removing it unless you have a good reason.  And now we know that removing it would be very very bad indeed.  Go Satoshi.  Weren't you a clever lad.

Then you don't understand consensus.
First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks, replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.

That's something I could completely understand.  That would be a good outcome, wouldn't it?  If you were a large payment processor, with your transaction directly connected to your node, there would also be a cost saving, because the connections would be happening through your own node.  The original understanding of who would be housing nodes (the people accepting the payments) would again become a selfish exercise.


Good?  Wouldn't it end up being the nodes that are physically closer between payer/payee that would be the ones chosen too?  They would be the one to first be queried for a handshake/connection between peers.

I've specifically warned people that bitcoin is likely to drop in all likelihood over the next two weeks, because it is unlikely that the ETF will be approved.  But I could be wrong.
Long term, it will make little difference.  Bitcoin either goes to several multiples of where it is today, or it goes to zero.  There is very little space in between those two outcomes.  Work on the assumption that it could go to zero, and you won't be alarmed when it is half the price it is today, but if it falls the other way, it'll be a good return on a small speculative bet.

The miners have plenty of say.  They will still be able to mine transactions just as they have before if that's what they so choose, will they not?


Like now?


?!  Miners don't validate blocks.  That's not what miners do.  Miners create blocks from transactions, and nodes validate the blocks they create.  Nothing has changed.   I think you're confused.

Depends on when the fork happens.  It could be one day.  So let's go with the average eh?  24 days.  About three weeks.  Assuming miners don't see the potential for huge fees to be had by switching over.  Cuz, you know, money. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:19:28
This isn't just a double-spend attack.  Bitmain, in their attack, will isolate the other chain, and ensure that no transactions get back to the nodes, because they will only build on blocks they create.  That's the 51% mining attack.  All other miners will be orphaned, because they don't have the hashing power.  So the bitmain attack is to stop all transactions on the chain they don't control, and the only real solution to this attack is a change of PoW.
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:11:57


There you go again.  Not knowing what consensus is.  Miners don't define consensus.  Nodes do.  We already have over 80% of consensus for segwit.


Nodes are the agents.  Not miners.
You can 'spin out 10,000 nodes tomorrow' but they will be 10,000 nodes that no-one talks to, and no-one cares about.  Call it what it would be : An alt-coin.
So now we know this, when already 80% of nodes have updated to segwit, how do we bring along miners, or indeed, do we even attempt to bring them along at all.  I personally don't want to punish any of them.  I want to investigate whether we can allow miners to decide which transactions they want to include in blocks, and let them decide how they want to order the blocks they create.  Do we care about miners that don't do what we want?  Do we care about whether we bring them along?  That's the question.

Emergent consensus, the block-size setting mechanism in ChinaBU, lets miners decide, through force of hash, the block size. This provides for them an incentive such that, as they increase the block-size, it leads to the nodes not being able to be run except with massive connections to the other nodes and miners. The miners that are closer (in bandwidth) to the other nodes, will have more time to retrieve the transaction and block data. Nodes and miners on slower connections will further deplete, as they can't source the data fast enough. This will also mean that communication between miners will favor miners that are closer together.
This means, by design, bitmain will be able to force ALL miners and ALL nodes off of the network, and every node and every miner will be housed in bitmain data-centers.
I'm sure bitmain would like to be the single miner, and the single node provider of bitcoin. But I'm not interested in bitcoin becoming china-coin thanks.

Time to stick a fork in ya, you're done.  
Come back when you know what a node does.


- Blocks may only create a certain number of bitcoins. (Currently 12.5 BTC per block.)
- Transactions must have correct signatures for the bitcoins being spent.
- Transactions/blocks must be in the correct data format.
- Within a single block chain, a transaction output cannot be double-spent.






1. The transactions syntax and data structure are correct.
2. The input and outputs have values.
3. The transaction is less than the block size of 1 MB.
4. The values must be more than 0 and less than 21 million.
5. None of the inputs have a hash that is equal to 0.
6. The locktime is less than the maximum allowed number.
7. The transaction size is greater than or equal to 100 bytes.
8. The number of signatures is less than the signatute limit.
9. The unlocking script can only push numbers onto the stack.
10. The locking script must match isstandard format.
11. A matching transaction must exist.
12. If a transaction is missing move the transaction to the orphan transaction pool.
13. If the transaction is a coinbase transaction then it must have a maturity of 100 confirmations.
14. For each input the output must exist and not have been spent.
15. Check that each input value is in the required range.
16. Reject if the input value is less than the output value.
17. Reject if the transaction value is to low to get into an empty block.
18. The unlocking scripts for each input must be verified against the output locking scripts.

Miners have always been able to create an alt-coin.  What they can't do is force nodes to adopt their consensus rules.  It is nodes that define what consensus rules they are willing to adopt, and how the transactions they create are to be validated. 
So now we know this, how do we bring along miners to the requirements we want?  I personally don't want to fire them. I want to understand their issues and resolve them.

And now they're finding out that that is not the case.


Nope.  They learn the easy way or the hard way that miners work for bitcoin, not the other way around.  If they don't like earning money ordering transactions the way bitcoin dictates they should be, they can use their hardware for some other purpose.
They have a choice.  Bitcoin way, or the highway.

No, it doesn't.  This is a problem with a lot of people who get their information from the rbtc cesspool.  They don't even know what consensus means.
First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks, replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.

Oh but they haven't!  Another one of the numpties that doesn't know what consensus means.




Nodes are the agents.  Bitmain is the one trying to create faulty-processes.  And if they don't do their job, they're always welcome to find another one. UASF is their formal employment warning. Do your job, or you're fired.
Here's your "quote" that you conveniently removed the part of which describes how nodes work in a multi-agent system in order to maintain conensus :


So now that we know what the word consensus means, let's quote what satoshi ACTUALLY said :


What does this mean if you are but a pointy headed numpty?
Nodes are agents in a multi-agent system with an agreed set of consensus rules that ensure that the system functions. Transactions are propagated through the multi-agent network based upon the agreed consensus rules by nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Miners retrieve valid transactions from any of these nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then order the transactions, and perform a hashing function on them until the hashing function returns a value that is suitable to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then pass the new block that they've created to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. The nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, then validate the block to ensure that each of the transactions within the block agree with the consensus rules. They then pass the new valid block, if it is valid, to other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Then each of these other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, each do the same validation on every block.
Oh lordy.  You numpties have been using quotes out of context?  Isn't that special?  
@_date: 2017-03-26 00:31:49

@_date: 2017-03-13 13:49:13
Emergent consensus, the block-size setting mechanism in ChinaBU, lets miners decide, through force of hash, the block size. This provides for them an incentive such that, as they increase the block-size, it leads to the nodes not being able to be run except with massive connections to the other nodes and miners. The miners that are closer (in bandwidth) to the other nodes, will have more time to retrieve the transaction and block data. Nodes and miners on slower connections will further deplete, as they can't source the data fast enough. This will also mean that communication between miners will favor miners that are closer together.
This means, by design, bitmain will be able to force ALL miners and ALL nodes off of the network, and every node and every miner will be housed in bitmain data-centers.
I'm sure bitmain would like to be the single miner, and the single node provider of bitcoin. But I'm not interested in bitcoin becoming china-coin thanks.

I'm still not sure how the path is established between nodes of the lightning network.  If it's similar to existing P2P networks, they are centralized 'lists' that are queried to determine where the current peers are.  This would seem to lend itself to this outcome.
My question is more about incentivization.  At present, it looks like the nodes are being run, for the most part, as a charity exercise.  Sure, you can configure a node, and if you were a payment processor, it's going to provide you more certainty having a node to directly query for your transactions, but it turns out a lot of processors have decided that it's an overhead they can do without.  By having the nodes incentivized, in that they can 'earn' bitcoin on transactions, more people would choose them for purely selfish reasons.  Without a large collection of nodes that aren't centralized, there's a clear attack vector.  By making it possible to earn bitcoin by hosting them, it should lead to their expanded use.
Or is this exactly what is being envisaged for the lightning network?

This is what I'm trying to say.  You need to reframe the argument into what the users want.  The miners don't define what the users can have.  The miners provide a service for the users, just like the developers.  
Users say "I want X", developers try to deliver that thing.  It doesn't matter which developers do it.  As long as the users all agree to implement X, it doesn't matter what anyone else wants.  Miners then compete with each other to deliver services to enable that thing.  If none do, then users can investigate how to make sure that some other service provider can give them what they're paying them to do.  Maybe it's impossible.  If that's the case, they're out of luck.  If it isn't, some service will be formed to meet that need.
It is not up to developers nor miners to dictate what users want.

I think you've missed that point.  The $7 / transaction is the theoretical electrical cost of a transaction, given the current txn limit, and the cost in electricity per block.  If the bitcoin reward was removed, this is how much it would cost to confirm a block.
I can't remember what the actual value is, but I seem to remember it being about that.
What the guy you were responding to clearly doesn't get (and reading your posts in this thread, you don't either), is that it's going to be harder to get to that requirement the longer you wait, so you'd better start now.  And that's what's happening.

Nodes enforce consensus. Whether the block is created by a segwit miner or a non segwit miner, the block is a valid block. If miners want to create blocks for whatever reason that are non consensus (Like your example of a miner trying to steal), they get forked. Just like today.

Bitcoin has a problem of miner centralization, and is going through the process of developing an implementation that removes miners ability to attack bitcoin like they are, while at the same time not punishing miners that aren't.
The fact is, this supposed 'lead to user desertion' isn't being backed up by reality.  The reason why the fees keep going up, is because people are prepared to pay them.  So this trope that somehow the fees are leading to bitcoin becoming less valuable, isn't actually reflected in either the price or the price of a transaction.
But either way, there are scalability and privacy improvements that are ready to go and they are being blocked by bitmain, a chinese miner.  They'll do what the bitcoin network tells them to do, or they can press ahead with their attack, and work at selling their new fandangled china-coin, with cheap fees, because no-one is interested in using it.

But.  It would require overwhelming consensus amongst existing bitcoin nodes that are actually being used by users and business.  95%?  99%?  So even if that's the path to take, it isn't going to be quick.  The question would be how that mechanism is activated.  That's the discussion that is going on right now.  My belief would be that as soon as the consensus looks like it is approaching overwhelming numbers, the miners will fall into line.  But gaming this to be sure that it can't be attacked by an adversarial element, needs to be fully developed before implementation.

Bitmain controls ~40% of the mining power.  Bitmain owns BTC.Top AND ViaBtc.  No other miner comes close.


Who says they care about profit?  They care much more about capital flight.


Bitmain is china.  The chinese government could confiscate the entire infrastructure, and there's not a god-damn thing anyone could do about.  If they haven't done it already.


[I just answered this question explicitly.](
This is what BU does, and this is what Bitmain wants :
Emergent consensus lets miners decide, through force of hash, the block size. This provides for them an incentive such that, as they increase the block-size, it leads to the nodes not being able to be run except with massive connections to the other nodes and miners. The miners that are closer (in bandwidth) to the other nodes, will have more time to retrieve the transaction and block data. Nodes and miners on slower connections will further deplete, as they can't source the data fast enough. This will also mean that communication between miners will favor miners that are closer together.
This means, by design, **bitmain will be able to force ALL miners and ALL nodes off of the network, and every node and every miner will be housed in bitmain data-centers.**
BU is the first step to china-coin.
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:33:22


And that doesn't matter.  Because the "majority of miners" don't validate the blockchain.  The nodes do.


Like an orphaned block.


Oh, but it does.  It is the nodes that define what bitcoin is, not the miners.  And when you have UASF, you have an overwhelming proportion of nodes saying that the new block created by miner X isn't a valid block, so the other miners will continue mining until they get a valid one.  So, like I said, it takes longer, but that's it.  It is no different than the ChinaBU node the other day producing a &gt;1MB block that was rejected by the nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-24 11:00:30

Miners only have the veto of blocks they create.  They don't have veto over what other miners may do.


BIP-102 doesn't have the quadratic hashing bug fix, nor the malleability fix.  Without those things, i wouldn't even want the block-size increase that segwit provides.  It's all trade-offs, and no benefits.
I think I'll just take segwit thanks.  
@_date: 2017-03-05 04:45:38


Yes it is.


And you do not have this power, because as soon as you try and publish your block that is different than the latest valid block that is agreed amongst the nodes, your new block that is trying to replace a valid block will be rejected.


Which requires 51% of hashing power.  If some cabal of miners gets 51% of the hashing power, and choose to fork bitcoin, they can.  They've always had this power.  That's why centralized mining is bad, and why this whole exercise demonstrates why miners controlling bitcoin is bad.  This doesn't change that attack vector one iota. They can play the game by the rules, or they can fork as a conscious decision and hope the overwhelming consensus of nodes that accept transactions follows them.  Which they won't.  That's the UA in UASF.


They've always had this power.  They just will no longer have the power to do it with other miners.

Except of course, you won't be able to run a node.  Because that centrally controlling miner just ratchets up the block-size until, unless you're directly connected to their infrastructure, the block-chain can't be propagated to you anymore.
@_date: 2017-03-24 05:46:30
That people don't upgrade to the UASF flag-day client.  Which probably means that it requires a really long activation time.

@_date: 2017-03-25 02:59:05
The problem you've got is that the creation of identifying keys can be gamed.  New person/company/numpty could create them, and perhaps not even use them.  Perhaps there would become a market for them.
I did have a think about what you're saying with some of the other things, as it fits in with something else I've thought about, which is much in the same vein.
An extension of this post :
   
Rather than change the core client, I have an extension of the method detailed above.  What about having a PKI (public key infrastructure) transaction pool?  PKI TxnPool.
The goal is to ensure that only miners that meet your user requirements can include your txns in a block.  The desire is to de-incentivize miners that are attacking the network, and that there is a clear path between nodes and miners for transactions that are validated.  This might not be able to stop a 51% attack, but it might be able to stop miner centralization occurring in the first place.
**PKI txnpool.**
**Setup :**
Miner creates prv/pub key pair.  Miner publishes pub key.  Could be anywhere.  Miner creates black-list of nodes (empty).  Pseudonymous.  Miners signs black-list with priv-key.
Node creates prv/pub key pair.   Pseudonymous. Node creates white-list miners using pub keys of miners.
**Adding txns to PKI txnpool.**
Node reads node mempool for new txn.  Node validates txn.  Node creates hash of txn.  Node encrypts txn using pub-keys of all miners in white-list.  Node signs encrypted txn.  Node creates txn-relay-file with : hash of txn, Node pubkey, Signature, list of white-listed miners, encrypted txn.  Node adds encrypted txn to PKI txnpool for relay.
   
We now have a txn that has been validated, with a node identifier, and a white-list of miners that can include their txn on the block-chain.
**PKI txnpool relay.**
Node peers with other node.  Nodes exchange pubkeys.  Nodes exchange miner black-lists with version numbers greater than on node.  Miner validates signature of miner black-list.  Node black-lists Node that has incorrectly signed miner black-list.  If valid continue, if not, cancel peer connection.  Nodes remove txns from PKI txnpool that are signed by black-listed nodes.  Nodes create exchange white-list, removing a miner from the white-list if it is in the miner black-list.  Nodes exchange curated miner white-lists. Nodes exchange txns that meet node white-list requirements.
**PKI txnpool removing txns that have been included in blocks or are too old.**
Node gets new block.  Node creates hash of each txn in block.  Node removes from PKI txnpool that have duplicate hash.  Node removes from  PKI txnpool txns that are &gt;cfg time from adding to local pool.
**Miners use PKI txnpool to get txns.**
Miner node sets white-list to only that miner.  It doesn't matter if they have more, they just won't be able to decrypt txns that they don't have the privkey for.  Miner queries PKI txnpool.  Miner uses privkey to decrypt txn.  Miner node validates txn.  If txn is invalid, add node that created txn to miner black-list.  Miner updates and signs black-list.  Miner replicates new miner-black-list to peer nodes.
Through this, PKI txnpool nodes work in an independent pool from bitcoin.   Nodes must ensure they create valid transactions, or they will be black-listed by any miner that opens a txn they created, and determine it is invalid, and the txns they create won't replicated. Miners can only black-list nodes that produce txns for them.  Miners can only decrypt transactions that have been encrypted using their pubkey.  This solution should allow users to select from a group of miners, and by extension, de-select miners that don't meet their requirements.  This provides a user and miner controlled tool to route-around malicious miners and nodes.

Indeed.  But they already run bridging nodes, and probably aren't even running reference clients.  It's not up to bitcoin users to tell miners how to do their jobs.  They already have an entire network infrastructure setup (i.e. FIBRE) that allows them to replicate their data.  If they don't protect themselves against malicious miners, then they aren't doing their job very well.

Bitcoin will be fine with 30% of the mining capacity.  At the next difficulty reset it all goes back to normal. 
And they'll have more as soon as china-coin forks off too.  Because people aren't going to buy into a centralized china-coin. They'll sell off all of those coins and buy bitcoin.  So miners will tumble back into bitcoin as the value skyrockets. 
And with lightning enabled, we'll start getting instantaneous transactions to boot.  So who really cares about 3 hour confirms for a few weeks?

Each new txn in the chain will be a hash based upon the previous transactions, the value of the current exchange, and made by alice and bobs private keys (I only vaguely remember the specifics of that, but it's not particularly important to this discussion).  If Bobs chain is longer, because it contains a signed transaction that alice agreed to, and alice's is shorter, because it doesn't include that txn, bob clearly has the valid chain.  Unless both agree, the chain for each party doesn't change in length.
I believe the channel coordination occurs over a 'hub'.
PS+Edit: I'm using the word 'chain' but that's probably not right.  It's probably better to say ledger.

They can run whatever the like.  They don't accept transactions, nodes do.  If they want to run a non-consensus node, that is their prerogative.  It has always been thus.

The nodes dictate the bitcoin consensus rules.  If ChinaBU decides to create &gt;1MB blocks, they'll be forked from the network as an alt-coin.  And you know what's even worse?  If they continue talking to actual bitcoin nodes, their chain will be extinguished in a re-org too.

Way to go numpty.  You actually change the quote because you were wrong, and don't understand what [consensus actually means]( and didn't want to put in what satoshi ACTUALLY said :


That's how english works you fkn moron. Nodes-&gt;They. Nodes-&gt;They.  How pathetic is that?  You change a quote to 'prove' a point, that, when actually shown, says exactly the opposite of the thing you changed.   
What does this mean if you are but a pointy headed numpty?
Nodes are agents in a multi-agent system with an agreed set of consensus rules that ensure that the system functions. Transactions are propagated through the multi-agent network based upon the agreed consensus rules by nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Miners retrieve valid transactions from any of these nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then order the transactions, and perform a hashing function on them until the hashing function returns a value that is suitable to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then pass the new block that they've created to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. The nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, then validate the block to ensure that each of the transactions within the block agree with the consensus rules. They then pass the new valid block, if it is valid, to other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Then each of these other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, each do the same validation on every block.
Oh lordy. You numpties have been using quotes out of context? Isn't that special? You are, officially, not just a fkn moron, but a lying one as well.

@_date: 2017-03-08 04:33:19
Emergent consensus lets miners decide, through force of hash, the block size. This provides for them an incentive such that, as they increase the block-size, it leads to the nodes not being able to be run except with massive connections to the other nodes and miners. The miners that are closer (in bandwidth) to the other nodes, will have more time to retrieve the transaction and block data. Nodes and miners on slower connections will further deplete, as they can't source the data fast enough. This will also mean that communication between miners will favor miners that are closer together.
This means, by design, bitmain will be able to force ALL miners and ALL nodes off of the network, and every node and every miner will be housed in bitmain data-centers.
BU is the first step to china-coin.

A segwit transaction is the regular bitcoin network.  If you think otherwise, you don't know what a segwit transaction is, what a bitcoin transaction is, or what the bitcoin network is.  A segwit transaction is simply an upgraded version of a bitcoin transaction so that the data is stored in a more robust format.
Perhaps you meant LN instead of segwit?  Then yes.  It's up to you to decide if you want to create a lightning channel and use LN, or use a traditional bitcoin transaction.

Canned response of mine, but it sort of tells it.  No, not really like you envisage.  It's not just about you-and-i.  That's the beauty of LN.
So. Lightning. Lightning allows users to take a single bitcoin transaction, and use it over a finite space of time, in order to shift bitcoin back and forth, with no or vanishingly small transaction fees, as iou's between what are called 'lightning channels'. The actual transaction size will be the same as a normal transaction, with a flag that says it can only be committed to the blockchain at a specific time (or block depth). In effect, these lightning transactions are cryptographically signed 'iou's. The 'thousands' of back-and-forth iou changes are discarded when the channel is closed (massive privacy dividend), and only the aggregated change is committed to the blockchain. This is the great thing about lightning. It is a single transaction with as many inputs and outputs (one/two) as defined in the original transaction. Only the transaction values change.
Consider a channel link of this : John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne. Only the people next to each people in the chain have a 'channel open' with each other (John/Bob, Bob/Sally, Sally/Anne). Assuming each of the channels between all of the participants have adequate funds in order to achieve this, if John wanted to send 1btc to Anne. A transaction ledger would read :
John-&gt;Bob channel : John -1btc, Bob +1btc
Bob-&gt;Sally channel : Bob -1btc, Sally +1btc
Sally-&gt;Anne channel : Sally -1btc, Anne +1btc.
Anne now has 1btc more, and John has 1btc less, but the net effect in each channel is simply a modification to the distribution of bitcoin in that channel.
Imagine this happening, back and forth, and extended to thousands, tens of thousands, and millions of people. As long as there's a chain between them, you use the chain. You might even have your transaction split over multiple chains. For links that don't have a chain, you create a channel on-the-fly.
Each channel, therefore, only ends up with the same single input, and the same two outputs, just differing values.
It's significantly more complex than that (transaction routing, and channel closure mechanics), but that's the idea. I wish I could remember the lightning dev that explained it. It really is very clever. I haven't actually questioned about the effect of having channels with multiple inputs (John/Sally) and outputs (Bob/Anne) at inception. Technically, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible. Just a much weirder set of ramifications.
So THAT is a bitcoin scalability solution. THAT is what segwit enables. INCLUDING a block size increase, and the other bug fixes. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 13:08:14
Sigh... No.
Every miner has a node.  From that node, it sources transactions.  Those nodes communicate with other nodes.  Let's say a miner has one of them shitty ChinaBU nodes.  There are a few of em.  Not many, but a few.
A miner extracts transactions from the shitty ChinaBU node, orders them, and then does their hashing thang.  Let's assume it gets a solve, say... a 1.1MB block, and it takes its newly minted block, and adds the block to the node.  The node (and this is one of the important parts) validates the block to determine if it meets the consensus rules.  If it doesn't, it rejects it.  If it does, it propagates it.  The shitty ChinaBU thinks it's A-OK.  So on we go.
Now the miner thinks bonza!  Start making me a new block!  We'll come back to that later.
Now that block gets sent to the next node (there are about 6000, 5700 or so that enforce core consensus) and THAT node checks that block (every node checks every block every time), and sees whether it satisfies consensus rules.  If it doesn't, it rejects it.  Just like the other one should have.  All those other thousands upon thousands of nodes keep waiting for a miner to produce a block that satisfies their consensus rules.  So the other nodes say, soz node, we are not going to accept your block.  You just go and mind your own business until you come back with valid blocks.
Let's say I've just made a transaction, and it got included in the shitty ChinaBU node.  According to our hapless miner, he just got my mining reward.  Yippee!  But when I query the block explorer, because that block got rejected by aaaaaallll of those nodes, my txn is still sitting in the mempool of every node except the hapless miner.  Soon, another miner includes the ~~block~~txn in a valid block, and we continue on where we were going, but that's another story.
Oh, and our hapless miner?  He's still looking to add transactions to a chain that has been rejected.  He is, as they say, forked.
So.  How many miners in this little story of ours, did we end up talking about?

I don't see that at all I'm afraid.  I'm not talking about the users, but the developers?  Nah.  Just out of their depth.

@_date: 2017-03-04 14:41:45


You are again missing the point of UASF.  The requirement of UASF is such that rules have been added to consensus.  It is saying that the nodes controlling inputs to the system are presenting another layer of consensus requirements such that miners can pick and choose which types of transactions they would like to include in their blocks they mine.  They just can't veto the transactions that other miners want to include in the blocks that THEY mine.


The rules have been changed plenty of times since Satoshi left them.


That makes no sense at all.  A small cabal of miners forcing their will on the community is the only reason the actual users of bitcoin have to develop a method of overcoming their blocking.  And they do it by giving miners the choice of which transactions they'd like to include in the blocks they mine, a choice the miners don't have the courtesy of returning.
@_date: 2017-03-04 18:32:06

You numpties have been caught out.  "Fork fork fork.  We want a fork" you squealed.  Here's a solution that enacts the change without miners needing to change anything.  And then you squeal "oh noes!!!!  What about the fork!?!?!"

Oh, you want to have a discussion then?  Here, let's go then.
Nodes are nodes.  Nodes validate.  All of them do.  It's what they do.


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




Nodes are the agents in a multi-agent system enforcing consensus.
Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, validate the transactions, replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks, replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.

Don't you ever tire of being wrong?
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:25:32


Yep.  But if they actually want to compete with core, they have to recognize that they have to shift the perceptions of users, so that users might recognize that they have a better solution.  To do that, they have to recognize what users really want.  The 80% adoption of segwit by nodes is a glaring statistic that can't be swept under the rug.  It doesn't matter if you have the largest miner in the world on your side.  If you don't control the consensus rules, you've got nothing.
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:49:04
It's up to the miners to protect themselves against malicious miners, and there is already a solution for them to do so.  They don't even need to mine segwit transactions, but if they want to protect themselves from malicious miners (you know, people like themselves) they can use a bridging node.
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:43:29
It depends if they want their nodes to break when it activates.

I'm talking about bitcoin though.  Changing the model of compensation to miners is not really an option that I can see.  Given that assumption, I'm trying to think of other methods of incentivization so that issues that exist with regard to decentralization, can be addressed.

Sounds like we need segwit.  That fixes malleability does it not?
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:10:12


It provides a malleability fix that makes lightning possible as a real scalability improvement without affecting decentralization *too much*.  And it's important to state that, because that block-size increase of segwit could be very bad for decentralization, but it is the best option available that experts agree can be handled, but needs to be investigated with great care.


Not if transactions are $3 a pop it won't be.


The segwit increase of block size to over double its current capacity is a good opportunity to investigate the actual effect of a block-size increase on decentralization, so that we can make educated decisions on what block-size increases may be possible in the future.
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:41:55
Nodes that don't handle transactions are immaterial to this discussion.  As long as people who are using bitcoin are using core nodes to sign and accept transactions, the core rules apply to all of those transactions.  97% of nodes do this, and every node that manages transactions probably does too, and that includes the nodes being run by miners that are signalling ChinaBU.
If Bitmain attacks the bitcoin blockchain after they fork, every one of those users will no longer be able to create transactions, so they will have to upgrade to a new client with a new PoW in order to continue using bitcoin.  And when they do that, it goes back to normal, except the hundreds of millions of dollars that have been spent on ASIC miners will be immediately rendered obsolete.

Pave the way for who?  ChinaBU will be recognized as the china-centric coin, and effectively cease any development that improved privacy.  So no segwit, no nothing.  Just a dead coin that no-one wants to use, or develop for, or support.

But you can't set up 1000 more nodes that are creating transactions, now can you?  Which is why your last rapid classic McNode expansion experiment died in the ass.  Because no-one used your nodes for making bitcoin transactions.  Aww...

Oh look, the guy who doesn't like false narratives just created another one.  It seems like you're not so much concerned with false narratives, so much as you're aware that they get created, and want to create more of them.
This isn't about "avoiding totalitarianism", this is about avoiding the blockchain being run out of bitmain data-centers, which is a company that exists in a totalitarian country that is concerned with capital flight, and probably controls &gt;50% of the mining hashing.
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:51:12
Emergent consensus, the block-size setting mechanism in ChinaBU, lets miners decide, through force of hash, the block size. This provides for them an incentive such that, as they increase the block-size, it leads to the nodes not being able to be run except with massive connections to the other nodes and miners. The miners that are closer (in bandwidth) to the other nodes, will have more time to retrieve the transaction and block data. Nodes and miners on slower connections will further deplete, as they can't source the data fast enough. This will also mean that communication between miners will favor miners that are closer together.
This means, by design, bitmain will be able to force ALL miners and ALL nodes off of the network, and every node and every miner will be housed in bitmain data-centers.
I'm sure bitmain would like to be the single miner, and the single node provider of bitcoin. But I'm not interested in bitcoin becoming china-coin thanks.

Bahaha 
Old miners can't create blocks with segwit txns so they will continue creating blocks just like they do today!  Ha!  Segwit miner creates segwit blocks and those blocks satisfy all consensus rules of the old nodes AND the segwit nodes.  Thats why it is backward compatible!

For the **millionth** time, segwit is a block-size increase.
We're not in a stale-mate. We're in a position in which a miner, bitmain, has announced its intention to attack bitcoin, and delay the introduction of privacy and scalability improvements. Until this occurred, no-one really knew that that was their intention. Now we do. There are several reasons why they could want to do this, none of which are good.
Segwit is deployed to almost all nodes, and most other infrastructure, and now the investigation is underway to develop a good and safe method that the users of bitcoin may use to ensure miners don't continue to block privacy and scalability. An example of this would be a system like UASF.
Until such a time as that is complete, or an equivalent, bitcoin goes from strength-to-strength, with more updates to the client software, and more efficiency gains in using it.
It is a false narrative that bitcoin development has stalled perpetuated by people who want to force a change that the users of the network don't want. The ChinaBU attack has stalled, except for the continued and escalating attack by bitmain, but that's a completely different thing. If they really had any strength, they'd produce &gt;1MB blocks, and let people follow china-coin if they want to. All it is showing is that bitmain isn't even using ChinaBU, they're using core, otherwise they'd be continually forking themselves from the network.

Incorrect.  Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hashes them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.

I don't think you've established it is anything at all.  Imagine free public transport.  What would happen if it was eh?  You'd have a lot of people using it all of the time.  That's the way bitcoin was before, effectively free.  Now, that cost is being recognized, and so it should.
I disagree that it's an issue.  Outside of spam-attacks, the system works as designed always.  During spam-attacks, it costs the attacker a significant, increasing, amount of money, until the attack stops.  As designed.
The block-reward is subsidizing the network costs.  This needs to change.  It is changing now.  As designed.
By the time it is actually an issue, we'll have seg-wit implemented, and lightning transactions, which takes whatever pressure might exist, off the chain.  As designed.

I always dismiss the 'it's just starting' argument.  You either have evidence of your assertion, or you don't.  What was happening the last time this even happened?  A low-fee spam attack.  By your rationale, this should have started in March, and gotten more and more congested as transaction volume increased.  It hasn't.
So what we have here, is the system working as intended, fighting off spam attacks, that get increasingly expensive to do, the longer they go on.

Stop attributing ideas to me that I do not have.  The guy I called out is a shill, given his 30 proclamations of exactly the same statement supporting coinbase in a sockpuppet account of 30 days.
Coinbase is a company like any other.  They work for their shareholders.  They cannot protect your assets from government seizure, which the government [HAS done in the past.](  
Trusting coinbase, or any other company, with your funds, is anathema to bitcoin and goes exactly against the entire purpose of owning it.  Encouraging people to put 'trust' into a protocol that is trustless by design is the epitome of stupidity.  It needs to be called out as stupidity whenever someone suggests it.  Bitcoin is secure.

 You started off saying that no one would grow their own food or drill for their own oil.  Oil isn't used really for electrical energy production, which is what mining requires, but solar is.  I demonstrated the truth that, indeed, people do grow their own food, and source their own energy.  And it is booming in case you hadn't looked. 
Now that we've established that people will in fact source their own energy, we are talking about efficiency in mining. If you source your own energy, you design your system to have spare capacity.  Simple engineering really.  That is spare capacity, because it is designed for maximum loads over a set amount of time, depending upon your risk profile.  Unless you are running at maximum capacity all of the time, you will have spare capacity.   If you are not connected to the grid, it is free energy.  That spare capacity, if you are connected to the grid, has an opportunity cost of the feed in tariff.  In oz, that value is usd0.04c/kwh, which makes it competitive with the cheapest energy in the world. 
Clear enough now?  You really should lose the attitude.  It doesn't help you.

No you're not.  What you're talking is a variation of [Post hoc ergo propter hoc]( and/or [argumentum ad populum]( but could equally be labeled a [red herring](


You can try and explain it all you like, but you would be better advised to learn what you're talking about first.  It demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the role of nodes in bitcoin.  All nodes that transact with the block-chain, by either sending transactions or, more importantly, receiving transactions, are created equal.


You are not using this word correctly.

@_date: 2017-03-15 10:23:41
Incorrect.  You are describing the the miner signalling activation method soft-fork method of consensus.  It is not the only consensus method.  If someone sent a segwit block or transaction to a node today, it would validate it.  Therefore, it is enabled.  What it isn't, is activated.  So miners aren't creating those blocks, and nodes, by convention, aren't relaying them.  But they could.  Because it is enabled.

I wouldn't be tough on that understanding, because if you were to ask most users of bitcoin that use light wallets, they'd mostly be unaware as to why it is as it is.   Miners get all of the rewards you say?  What's the incentive to running a node?  To understand that you need to understand the incentive structure of  bitcoin, and the incentive to run a node.  And that's definitely not an easy thing to convey, because now we are in a discussion about security.

Miners decide whether they will abide by those rules if they want to get block rewards and transaction fees from those nodes.  That's bitcoin.  That's how it works.  It is that incentive structure that is the ingenuity behind bitcoin.


A person who doesn't understand about nodes and consensus, is now an expert on sybil attacks?  You didn't even know the definition of consensus [until yesterday](


Nodes define consensus in bitcoin, not miners.  If they want to fork, they're welcome to.  Like BCH.


That makes no sense at all.  You're clearly rattled by having your ignorance of the workings of bitcoin demonstrated to you.




I say this, because at every opportunity to discuss the technical framework of bitcoin, you have proven to be completely ignorant.  And not just a little bit wrong, completely wrong.  All of the time.  After having all of the information in front of you, and everyone taking the time to explain it to you.

I think it's important to recognize that trustless doesn't actually truly mean trustless.  You still have to trust yourself.  You have to trust that you have the ability to secure your funds, and to correctly generate keys that allow other people to send to you.  It is this that you're trying to circumvent, and I don't think there's a way to do that.

Hey I've got a question for ya!
Do you know whether it is possible to lock the coins in one blockchain such that they form the seed in another?  I'm not that smart, so I'm sure other people have investigated something like this?
Say for example, i wanted to create a hard-fork, that was formed from the unspent transactions (or indeed, entire blockchain) of bitcoin.  Is there a way that I could **provably** lock the coins in the previous chain such that they could only be accessible in the new chain if that proof was available?  The only caveat would be that you would have to have X block depth on the original chain for the original txn, wouldn't it?

I ascribe to the economist world view that regulation should exist to enforce 'free trade'.  What we have is nowhere near that.  We have protected industries based upon ideologies. 
Objectively, the world is the best  it has ever been for the average human.  Population is stabilising, life expectancy is increasing.  Starvation, shrinking, has nothing to do with resources.  More people in the world live above the poverty line now in both per-capita and real terms, than at any time in history.  There is way way way less fear of, you know, nuclear annihilation, than the things that i remember from the 80's.  From what i read, 60's were worse.  And let us not forget WW2.

Miners are NOT included in consensus. Get it? Clear enough? They are not part of the process. They never have been. They never will be.
Nodes are agents in a multi-agent system with an agreed set of consensus rules that ensure that the system functions. Transactions are propagated through the multi-agent network based upon the agreed consensus rules by nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Miners retrieve valid transactions from any of these nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then order the transactions, and perform a hashing function on them until the hashing function returns a value that is suitable to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then pass the new block that they've created to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. The nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, then validate the block to ensure that each of the transactions within the block agree with the consensus rules. They then pass the new valid block, if it is valid, to other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Then each of these other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, each do the same validation on every block.
Get it now?  Clear?  I know it is isn't, but ffs, just stop it.  If you don't know what you're talking about, stop blathering on.  It's extremely annoying.

Try sticking with accounts not being a sockpuppet.  Sockpuppet 'opinions' are invalid by default.  The only reason sockpuppet  'opinions' exist is because the other account(s) don't have validity so they feel the need to manufacture some.

The important thing in a trustless protocol like bitcoin is to not insert a trust requirement in an exchange so you get warm fuzzy feelings that are actually more likely to wind you up with your money being stolen.
If ever bitcoin gets to its potential, and the US goes through another financial crisis (and they will) you can bet your ass there's going to be another executive order like the one that has already happened.

The issue is really just the size of the bitcoin market-cap.  15 billion (or whatever) simply isn't a large enough pool to justify it as a pool for purchasing.  Not yet.  Paypal would be 100x to 1000x times this, because it is fed by the credit industry.  If bitcoin were 10x the value, people would start seeing it as a viable ecosystem to park capital in order to make on-the-fly purchases.  Right now, that's just not the case.
Right now, bitcoins use-case is as a store of value that is appreciating (pretty quickly) over time.  That alone justifies further adoption.  When it has other use-cases, they will become available, and there will be justification for adopting them.
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:32:46

That is completely ineffective at changing consensus rules.


It doesn't matter what you believe.  I'm not being facetious.  It literally doesn't matter.  It matters what node client people use in order to transact with the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-08-01 23:03:00
Oh dear, you're one of those numpties that uses that quote out of context :
Here, let's use the FULL QUOTE :


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




What does this mean if you are but an intrepid traveler amongst the erstwhile numpty-folk?
Nodes are agents in a multi-agent system with [an agreed set of consensus rules]( that ensure that the system functions. Transactions are propagated through the multi-agent network based upon the agreed consensus rules by nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Miners retrieve valid transactions from any of these nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then order the transactions, and perform a hashing function on them until the hashing function returns a value that is suitable to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then pass the new block that they've created to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. The nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, then validate the block to ensure that each of the transactions within the block agree with the consensus rules. Then the node, which is an agent in a multi-agent system, extends the block-chain by attaching the new block to it.  They then pass the new block, if it is valid, to other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Then each of these other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, each do the same validation on every block.
Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node extends the blockchain.  Miners don't.  The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.  It is the validation of the nodes, and their CPU's, that define and police consensus in bitcoin.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, validate the transactions (using their CPU), replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks (using their CPU), extend the blockchain (using their CPU), replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.  And if you can't convince these node owners that are using their node on a day-to-day basis, to uninstall their node software and install something that decreases their node security and decreases the network security, any change you have is going to go exactly nowhere.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.  If you can't convince all of those node owners running their node clients to uninstall one client and re-install another, any change you have to consensus is DOA.

People keep telling you the answer to this, and you keep posting the same question. By doing this repeatedly, you keep on demonstrating a complete lack of understanding of what bitcoin is.
The only thing you would do if you said that you were linking bitcoin to gold would be implementing a trust requirement in a trustless protocol. You would have to trust the person/company/entity to redeem the gold on request. You can't prove they've got it, so you have to trust them when they say they do.  If you put a key on a gold chain, what's to stop the person spending the bitcoin at that address?  You have to trust they haven't done it, and you have to trust that they'll never do it.
I can prove I have the amount of bitcoin I have in my possession without you ever needing to know who I am. I can cryptographically sign a txn, and give that you to, so that you may review it on the blockchain, and it would demonstrate that I have the key necessary in order to spend the bitcoin there.

Yes.  I'm sure.  
Do even understand the concept of a fork?  You don't really, do you?  I mean, you have simply no clue, whatsoever, of the technical process about which a fork occurs?  
Nodes define consensus in bitcoin.  It is a rule-set that every node applies to every transaction and every block.  In order to fork, they have to replace their consensus rules with a different set of consensus rules.  As in, physically.  10's of thousands of nodes have to simultaneously agree to change their consensus rules from something that is trusted currently by all, to software written by shysters and charlatans.
You need to turn off that rbtc tap.  It makes ya stooooopoid.

Specific block depth, not time.  It's about 550 blocks or so.


No.  There's a possibility that some miners would (unwisely) create a chain-split, but it would be equivalent to them putting a shotgun in their mouths and pulling the trigger.  Messy, but still suicide.
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:58:41
A lot of things will be proposed over the next few months.  The safest thing to do is to install the 0.15 core reference node client when it becomes available over the next few weeks, as it will not allow the connection of any nodes of 2x because of the attack. 
In practice, i expect support for 2x is going to crater over the next two months unless it implements replay protection, or no exchanges are going to even list it.  When they do implement it, as they will be forced to, it will fork to an alt and will have negligible mining support like bch.

Bitcoin would have to already be worth 100x its current value in order to justify what, in effect, would be capital controls. And if that happened who knows what effect it would have. 
One thing for sure though, if it happened, you wouldn't find out about it until after.

Segwit/Lightning does address the blocksize issue.  That's the point.  Double the direct on-chain transactions through segwit, and more aggregated on-chain transactions by several orders of magnitude through lightning.  Not to mention the transaction malleability fix and quadratic to linear hashing fix.
EDIT: Hey this is the type of nonsense that you own.  You caused this.  It's your rbtc anti-logic cesspool that allows this type of numpty to carry on thinking they have a valid opinion on this matter.  He doesn't know what segwit is.  He doesn't know what lightning is.

Hey, if you're intersted in a rollicking read by one of the best authors in the world about the birth of money/futures/trading that is wrapped up in an awesome story, you could do worse than reading The Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson.
I'm not sure you really understand that much of the history of money, and it really is quite fun to read.  First book of the series takes about 150 pages to get into, but from that point forward, it never lets up.  In truth, the second and third books are better, but only because of the first.  It's not often you can read a fun book and learn so much at the same time.  As a FYI, did you know that Isaac Newton was warden of the Mint of England?  And, more importantly, why?  Don't want to give away the story, but if you do read, no peeking on wiki.  You end up finding out when major characters get their heads chopped off.
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:53:26
 right and wrong.  Yes it is being attacked, but as you state that is bitcoin.  If it wasnt being attacked, it wouldn't be of value. It is its ability to withstand attack that makes it so valuable.

Yes yes.  I get it.  You don't know how bitcoin works.




Yes.  If you want it to be a hard-fork, instead of an alt-coin.


You have always been welcome to fork off to china-coin.  Everyone else will just continue using bitcoin.  Your hard-fork is nothing more than a new pre-mined alt-coin.  Just like today.

@_date: 2017-01-08 05:53:05
You can do this manually if you want.
When creating a transaction, good wallets (like electrum) will give you the txn size before you commit it to the blockchain.  Use that txn size and multiply it by the numbers shown here.
You'll be able to quickly choose an appropriate fee to ensure the txn appears in the next block.

You have been repeatedly warned about keeping your bitcoin on an exchange.  You will receive no sympathy when you lose it because you inserted a trust requirement into a trustless protocol.

 Yes. 


Only if you don't know how bitcoin works.


But they can't change my node, now can they?
You really should learn how bitcoin works.  When you learn, you learn that the decentralization of nodes **that people use** to actually send and receive bitcoin, is what makes it what it is.  It is an ingenious design.  
Everyone who really wants to learn how bitcoin works starts as you.  I did.  Once the realization happens as to how consensus works and the conflicting incentives of miners and nodes, it is like a light switching on.  No one can force you to change your node, so no one can force a change of consensus rules on you, not  even if they have a million nodes.  Miners earn their bitcoin by obeying those rules.  Nodes will not downgrade their security to assist miners in centralizing nodes and miners.  Once you realize this, you'll begin to realize just exactly how revolutionary bitcoin is.  You'll also realize that this decentralization of nodes is what separates bitcoin from every other crypto. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:33:55
?  I think this is supposed to be the response to another thread?
@_date: 2017-01-13 21:36:27
The only thing this has shown is that agreements with these people mean nothing. They'll adopt segwit out of selfish self interest or they'll see their investment flushed down the toilet. Bitcoin will continue on but the expansion will slow so that difficulty increase will continue to marginalize the scalability blockers. It will cost them more and more to run mining and they'll get less and less a return.  They only ever had one option.  Keep it the way it is forever, or follow core. They'll figure it out eventually. 
If and when a hard fork happens (unlikely within years) it won't have anything to so with block sizes.

@_date: 2017-01-25 09:46:31
No.  And that's what the problem is... you have a belief which is rooted in a complete misunderstanding of how bitcoin works.
If you double the size of the block, you double the size of the upload bandwidth requirement.  [This utility]( will show you how much upload bandwidth is required to run a node, and what that upload bandwidth requirement is if you change the block size.
Those blocks will be full almost instantly.  Because a blockchain without a fee-market is a free permanent storage device.  But not only that, the upload bandwidth requirement for a node is already at the point where anywhere except a relatively minor portion of countries wouldn't be able to handle the increase.  That means regular companies or people that don't have specialist bandwidth contracts with their ISP's (and, for the record, that's 90% of the people in Australia at any price) will immediately never be able to run a node again.
THAT leads to more centralization of nodes.  THAT is what leads to security being sacrificed to satisfy the mindless rantings of people who simply have no clue of what they're talking about.

First off, it is a hard-fork.  So it is not an update of consensus rules, it is a replacement. 
Secondly, it is a fork that is forcing existing node users to change their node clients because of the lack of replay protection.  If it was just a fork, good luck.  Because it is not, it is an attack.

This is something I wrote a while back.
Lightning allows users to take a single bitcoin transaction, and use it over a finite space of time, in order to shift bitcoin back and forth, with no or vanishingly small transaction fees, as iou's between what are called 'lightning channels'. The actual transaction size will be the same as a normal transaction, with a flag that says it can only be committed to the blockchain at a specific time (or block depth). In effect, these lightning transactions are cryptographically signed 'iou's. The 'thousands' of back-and-forth iou changes are discarded when the channel is closed (massive privacy dividend), and only the aggregated change is committed to the blockchain. This is the great thing about lightning. It is a single transaction with as many inputs and outputs (one/two) as defined in the original transaction. Only the transaction values change.
Consider a channel link of this : John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne. Only the people next to each other in the chain have a 'channel open' with each other (John/Bob, Bob/Sally, Sally/Anne). Assuming each of the channels between all of the participants have adequate funds in order to achieve this, if John wanted to send 1btc to Anne. A transaction ledger would read :
John-&gt;Bob channel : John -1btc, Bob +1btc
Bob-&gt;Sally channel : Bob -1btc, Sally +1btc
Sally-&gt;Anne channel : Sally -1btc, Anne +1btc.
Anne now has 1btc more, and John has 1btc less, but the net effect in each channel is simply a modification to the distribution of bitcoin in that channel.
Imagine this happening, back and forth, and extended to thousands, tens of thousands, and millions of people. As long as there's a chain between them, you use the chain. You might even have your transaction split over multiple chains. For links that don't have a chain, you create a channel on-the-fly.
Each channel, therefore, only ends up with the same single input, and the same two outputs, just differing values.
It's significantly more complex than that (transaction routing, and channel closure mechanics), but that's the idea. I wish I could remember the lightning dev that explained it. It really is very clever. I haven't actually questioned about the effect of having channels with multiple inputs (John/Sally) and outputs (Bob/Anne) at inception. Technically, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible. Just a much weirder set of ramifications.
I would suggest that the method for creating ln channels is most likely :  Carol wants to pay Bob 0.5btc.  She creates a ln channel with 1btc, of which Bob is allocated 0.5btc, and carol is allocated 0.5btc.  Bob gets paid 0.5btc that is accessible once confirmed.  Carol has 0.5btc that is now accessible once confirmed.  That way the ln can be bootstrapped by existing txns.
I'd also suggest that it would be easier to understand if Bob were Bob Inc.  The incentive will be for the buyer to reduce txn fees.  If Carol uses a store (coffee?) she will want to reduce paying those fees.   So she creates a channel with 0.1btc and 0.001 is allocated to Bob Inc. For the coffee she buys today, coffee + txn fee.  Ever more?  Zippo txn fee.   When your channel is almost zero, you buy bitcoin, it is delivered back to you by the rebalancing of that channel. And because it's Bob Inc the path through the channels from a source of bitcoin is reduced, maybe even two hops ( exchangeA/exchangeB -&gt; exchangeB/Bob Inc. -&gt; Bob Inc./Carol).

I'm going to give you the benefit of one doubt.  You said this :


If you're not an expert, how do you make an assertion like that?  That's not a question.  That is an assertion.  A question is.


Notice the question word at the beginning of the sentence?  What you did was a leading question of a narrative.  It is the 'this is what people are doing, prove me wrong'.  I have no time for that type of bullshit, because I've had that narrative by pointy headed gits for over a year.
So start framing your questions as questions, and not framing them as a bullshit narrative, and you won't get a guy like me ripping that narrative apart.

Recommending someone trust a 3rd party with bitcoin is the worst advice one can give. The very point of bitcoin is to remove that trust. If people lose their money it is only their money and their fault. Recommending the storage of money on an exchange creates a honey pot for hackers and/or an excuse for regulatory capture, and that is **your** fault.

Lol spices.   It was [opium]( dude.  Heroin.  Technically called black spice because that didn't make em sound so much like state sponsored drug pushers, which is exactly what they were, but that's what it was. 
The East India Company grew opium in the greater India area, and then shipped it to China, and shipped the gold (and silver) they earned from it back.  They used this money to essentially enslave and rape India and what is now known as Pakistan and Afghanistan.  When the Chinese emperor tried to stop the opium trade, [after a couple of wars]( the british navy stepped in (later known as gun-boat diplomacy), bombed hell out of the Chinese, and burned the summer palace to the ground.

It is this relationship that is most problematic.  You reckon that satoshi is going to sell his bch coins?


The only thing you can say in that instance is that there is some indication that the market has dropped.  That 40% value could be 1%.  Under certain conditions it could actually be the opposite.  Remember, most cryptos aren't even priced in dollars, but in bitcoin.  If bitcoin drops, they drop.
Two weeks ago a new crypto was created by forking bitcoin.  It is priced at $300/coin.  Does that mean $6 billion was just magically created?  


This is a very dangerous way to invest.  More money is moving into crypto, i think we can agree.  But that has no relationship to the metric you're using.  You're guessing, and luckily have guessed right up until now. 
Guessing isn't a very good investment strategy, even if you guess right.  It's called [survivorship bias](  There are millions of gold and silver investors that thought as you do 10 years ago, for exactly the same reason. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:50:50
And that is the power of the nodes.  The fact that you can't measure them, and therefore can't force them to do anything. It  is your lack of coercive power against nodes that forms the crux of your angst.

Yes.  The main screen will show you the progress with a little dial.


That's the advantage of a deterministic wallet. All of them are linked to the same master seed.   No-one knows, except you, that all of those addresses are related, and controlled by you.  If you want to send a payment that is sourced from two of them, you select two addresses with the ctrl, and it makes two inputs for the payment.  Just be aware the more inputs, the larger the miner fee.

I don't know what to make of Andresen.  There's no way that he could be stupid, and he's not crazy, but some of the things he goes on about are... weird.  
The only context that seems to have had a consistent alignment is his dealings with MIT.  Every input I've seen by MIT has been to try to move bitcoin into not just government control, but american government control.  That started while he was still there.  Indeed, the CIA briefings and the immediate departure of Nakamoto is a fact that just can't be swept aside.  The MIT ChainAnchor project is AIDS as far as I'm concerned, and it's part of a long history of this type of behavior.
He's not with MIT anymore apparently.  I don't jump at shadows, I just don't really know what the hell he's on about.

Bullshit.  You want to use bitcoin, learn how to use bitcoin. If you want to put your money in a bank, put your money in a bank.  Recommending someone trust a 3rd party with bitcoin is the worst advice one can give. The very point of bitcoin is to remove that trust. If people lose their money it is only their money and their fault. Recommending the storage of money on an exchange creates a honey pot for hackers and/or an excuse for regulatory capture, and that is **your** fault. 
But what you shouldn't do is rely upon the opinions of people that won't even follow their own advice.

That crypto market cap means absolutely nothing.  Even the bitcoin market cap doesn't mean much. The market caps have no information on how many coins are actually in the market. Some big ones ( like nem and ripple ) have zero relationship between coin count and coin availability for exchange. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:36:08


What the fuck does that even mean?


No, nodes do.  It is the consensus rules that are enforced by the nodes that define what bitcoin is.


If you can't get those nodes to change their consensus rules, you don't have squat.  That's the point.  That's what makes it so powerful, and so difficult to change.  As has [already by explained to you.](


The question I've got is whether you were always this lacking in critical thinking skills, or whether rbtc did this to you.
@_date: 2017-08-07 09:20:14


The security through the decentralization of nodes.  Because of that decentralization, any payment you make can't be censored.  No other crypto comes even close to that decentralization, which is why no crypto comes even close to its value.
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:10:19


If you are not connected to a grid, all excess solar power is free.  In Australia the feed in tariff of solar is 4c usd / kwh, so even if you are connected, that power price makes it as profitable as china.

BU leads to the reduction and centralization of nodes.  It ain't gonna happen. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:10:00


And it turns out you're wrong.  And then you've used that wrongness to create tools made out of wrong, and built a house of wrong on top of it.
You started off saying that no one would grow their own food or drill for their own oil. Oil isn't used really for electrical energy production, which is what mining requires, but solar is. I demonstrated the truth that, indeed, people do grow their own food, and source their own energy. **And it is booming in case you hadn't looked.**
Now that we've established that people will in fact source their own energy, we are talking about efficiency in mining. If you source your own energy, you design your system to have spare capacity. Simple engineering really. That is spare capacity, because it is designed for maximum loads over a set amount of time, depending upon your risk profile. Unless you are running at maximum capacity all of the time, you will have spare capacity. If you are not connected to the grid, it is free energy. That spare capacity, if you are connected to the grid, has an opportunity cost of the feed in tariff. In oz, that value is usd0.04c/kwh, which makes it competitive with the cheapest energy in the world.
Clear enough now? You really should lose the attitude. It doesn't help you.

[This]( is how I envisage it being bootstrapped :
I would suggest that the method for creating ln channels is most likely : 


Bob gets paid 0.5btc that is accessible once confirmed.  Carol has 0.5btc that is now accessible once confirmed.  That way the ln can be bootstrapped by existing txns.
I'd also suggest that it would be easier to understand if Bob were Bob Inc.  The incentive will be for the buyer to reduce txns.  If Carol uses a store (coffee?) she will want to reduce paying those fees.   So she creates a channel with 0.1btc and 0.001 is allocated to Bob Inc. For the coffee she buys today, coffee + txn fee.  Ever more?  Zippo txn fee.   When your channel is almost zero, you buy bitcoin, it is delivered back to you by the rebalancing of that channel. And because it's Bob Inc the path through the channels from a source of bitcoin is reduced, maybe even two hops ( exchangeA/exchangeB -&gt; exchangeB/Bob Inc. -&gt; Bob Inc./Carol).

 segwit was the compromise. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:30:45
It puts the ceiling on the total number of coins in the new chain (which is &lt; the previous chain), but the price is determined by what people are willing to pay for it.  If you maintain the same block creation schedule on the new chain (I have an idea how to align this too), it becomes a choice which chain you use, one or the other, not about having value on both chains.  Because of the lock on the old chain, gradually the old chain would have less and less value available to it as value is transferred to the new one.  But you're right, at least for some length of time, the values would be aligned.
Essentially the new chain is locked, with coins available to anyone that is prepared to unlock them using the private keys available in the old chain.  So the same as a regular hard-fork.  But the unlocking process on the new chain requires a transaction on the old chain detailing how the coins at that address have been spent on the old chain and are no longer redeemable.
The issue would obviously be if the miners on the old chain chose to reset the chain back.  I can't think of any way that you would be able to do this without nominating what block-depth is acceptable on the old chain in order to unlock the value on the new chain.  This could be done using the scripting nlock time couldn't it?  But there might even be a way to resolve that problem too.  
The other thing you could do would be to increase the decimal count in the new chain.  As was kind enough to explain to me once, it is actually the satoshi that is the base level of bitcoin.  The bitcoin determination of eight decimal places is arbitrary.  But with the new chain, you could nominate the arbitrary count as 16 decimal places, and the transfer of value from the old chain could be redeemed in the new chain as 1x10^8 satoshis.
Can you let me know if you can think of a problem with my logic?

@_date: 2017-01-24 16:25:12
For the record the cost you should have paid for 226 bytes is about 50% more than you paid at the best of times.
It's really quite simple. 226 bytes x 100 satoshis per byte is 0.000226.  But now the fee is about 120.  So add 20%.  Thats about 0.00027.  I expect that your txn will confirm.  But if you don't pay to get into the next block, that length of time can vary greatly. 
You know this site tells you those values?

@_date: 2017-08-27 06:01:24


 incorrect.  
It is only all nodes accepting a common set of consensus rules that  allows consensus to be enforced.  Unless all nodes agree to a consensus change, you have created an alt.  That's bitcoin.  That's its strength.  That is the thing that separates it from all other alts. You can't change it unless everyone agrees, unless the change you have can be ignored.  And because bitcoin has more nodes that are actually used to make bitcoin transactions, it is by several orders of magnitude more difficult to adopt consensus changes.

I would write down the seed, delete the wallet, delete the app, and then re-install it all from scratch from backups not related to the device.
In fact, what I have done is record the seed, record every address in the wallet, and store the wallet and every piece of information used to create the wallet in more than one encrypted volume off-site.   I use truecrypt 7.1a
Then I have deleted the wallet, deleted all of the files, removed the virtual machine that was used to create the wallet, erased the hard-drive on which it was stored, and deleted every file or reference related to the wallet.  I then restore everything from one of my off-site backups.  If that works, then I know it is secure.

As a person who, right now because of segwit, hits the upload bandwidth limit available to a consumer internet connection in Australia **at any price**, I have a slightly different view as to where the burden of proof should lie with block size increases.   An increase above that means a node cannot be run by 50% of the population of australia at any price.  So I'm not really open to any blocksize increase whatsoever for some length of time.  That's why the segwit blocksize increase was such a compromise.

@_date: 2017-08-21 06:52:12


[100,000 or so core reference nodes]( disagrees with you oh seven-week-old rbtc sockpuppet.


Let's start with the white paper :


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




What does this mean if you are but an intrepid traveler amongst the erstwhile numpty-folk?
Nodes are agents in a multi-agent system with [an agreed set of consensus rules]( that ensure that the system functions. Transactions are propagated through the multi-agent network based upon the agreed consensus rules by nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Miners retrieve valid transactions from any of these nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then order the transactions, and perform a hashing function on them until the hashing function returns a value that is suitable to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then pass the new block that they've created to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. The nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, then validate the block to ensure that each of the transactions within the block agree with the consensus rules. Then the node, which is an agent in a multi-agent system, extends the block-chain by attaching the new block to it.  They then pass the new block, if it is valid, to other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Then each of these other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, each do the same validation on every block.
Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node extends the blockchain.  Miners don't.  The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.  It is the validation of the nodes, and their CPU's, that define and police consensus in bitcoin.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, validate the transactions (using their CPU), replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks (using their CPU), extend the blockchain (using their CPU), replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.  If you can't convince these node owners that are using their node on a day-to-day basis, to uninstall their node software and install your new node client, especially when that node client decreases their node security and decreases the network security, any change you have is going to go exactly nowhere.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.  If you can't convince all of those node owners running their node clients to uninstall one client and re-install another, any change you have to consensus is DOA.

Validation is the entire point of bitcoin.  Validation that that proof-of-work has been undertaken.  THAT is what nodes do.  THAT is what bitcoin is.  Without validation, miners can lie.  So what's more important?  The person who does the job?  Or the person who pays for him to do it?
You should take the time to figure out what a node does.




You and every other node owner needs to validate that the miners have done their job.  THAT is bitcoin.

There is only one side that has the technical expertise right now : core.   Which is why in this very thread you have people trying to convince you that it is not important to run a node.

Decentralization is about ensuring consensus is maintained amongst nodes, and the more nodes the better.  Every attempt to change the definition is because someone wants their rule-change to apply without requiring nodes to accept it.

I would suggest that the method for creating ln channels is most likely : Carol wants to pay Bob 0.5btc. She creates a ln channel with 1btc, of which Bob is allocated 0.5btc, and carol is allocated 0.5btc. Bob gets paid 0.5btc that is accessible once confirmed. Carol has 0.5btc that is now accessible once confirmed. That way the ln can be bootstrapped by existing txns.
I'd also suggest that it would be easier to understand if Bob were Bob Inc. The incentive will be for the buyer to reduce txn fees. If Carol uses a store (coffee?) she will want to reduce paying those fees. So she creates a channel with 0.1btc and 0.001 is allocated to Bob Inc. For the coffee she buys today, coffee + txn fee. Ever more? Zippo txn fee. When your channel is almost zero, you buy bitcoin, it is delivered back to you by the rebalancing of that channel. And because it's Bob Inc the path through the channels from a source of bitcoin is reduced, maybe even two hops ( exchangeA/exchangeB -&gt; exchangeB/Bob Inc. -&gt; Bob Inc./Carol).

It took a year to get 80% of nodes to upgrade to segwit aware clients, and that's a soft-fork containing changes that bitcoin users want, that doesn't negatively affect the users that didn't upgrade.

I'm saying that that would be implementing a trust requirement in a trustless protocol.  You would have to trust the person/company/entity to redeem the gold on request.  You can't prove they've got it, so you have to trust them when they say they do.  That demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of what bitcoin is.
I can prove I have the amount of bitcoin I have in my possession without you ever needing to know who I am.  I can cryptographically sign a txn that can be reviewed on the blockchain that demonstrates that I have the key necessary in order to spend the bitcoin there.

I actually think that that is a very long-term thing.  Bitcoin is a long long way away from that type of acceptance IMO.  There is a group of numpties that thinks if you reduce fees that people will flock to the system.  The reality is even when fees were lower they didn't.
Bitcoins use-case right now is as a store of value, and trustless and censorship resistant value transfer system.  The learning hurdles are too great for the average person.  Look how many people struggle figuring out how to calculate a fee?  And people expect even less technically inclined people to magically understand private and public key addresses?  Yeah... not any time soon.

@_date: 2017-08-05 23:53:12


You say that a lot.  I think it's another word you should query the definition of, because you are not applying it correctly.   I get it.  You haven't really thought it through. 
Think of bitcoin as an envelope.  A really secure one.  One that uses energy to secure its contents, where it becomes exponentially more secure the longer it is on the blockchain.  Where the contents of the envelope are secrets that people attach value to.  Where the barrier to securing your envelope requires the computing power of a raspberry pi, can be done pseudonymously, and remains just as secure.  Fun fact : you can store any information you want on the blockchain. 
So instead of talking about air conditioners, we can talk about bitcoin instead? It will make it easier to understand if you stop using analogies that don't apply ( like fiat), and actually learn how bitcoin works, and more importantly, why.

It can be made so.  It just takes a bit of effort.  As a default it's pseudonymous, which means all transactions are visible, but not linked to a person.

Create a new wallet on a different PC or device.  Electrum has a mobile wallet as well.  
Assuming you only had a phone, test creating, deleting, backing up and re-instating a wallet on that phone, including storing the seed off-site.  Test a small amount to transfer to the phone wallet.  Do the security test above again, and see that funds are there.
You can now re-instate that wallet on either your phone or your computer.
Personally, I'd delete all of that type of thing from my phone.  It's not fantastic security, but for that amount of money, it'd work until you either spent it, or wanted to look at acquiring more, and then you'd have to think a bit more carefully.

Atomic Swaps?  
Being able to pay in LTC to a person who only accepts BTC. Paying in BTC to a person who only accepts LTC.
Lightning?  ELI20 I wrote a while back.
Lightning allows users to take a single bitcoin transaction, and use it over a finite space of time, in order to shift bitcoin back and forth, with no or vanishingly small transaction fees, as iou's between what are called 'lightning channels'. The actual transaction size will be the same as a normal transaction, with a flag that says it can only be committed to the blockchain at a specific time (or block depth). In effect, these lightning transactions are cryptographically signed 'iou's. The 'thousands' of back-and-forth iou changes are discarded when the channel is closed (massive privacy dividend), and only the aggregated change is committed to the blockchain. This is the great thing about lightning. It is a single transaction with as many inputs and outputs (one/two) as defined in the original transaction. Only the transaction values change.
Consider a channel link of this : John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne. Only the people next to each other in the chain have a 'channel open' with each other (John/Bob, Bob/Sally, Sally/Anne). Assuming each of the channels between all of the participants have adequate funds in order to achieve this, if John wanted to send 1btc to Anne. A transaction ledger would read :
John-&gt;Bob channel : John -1btc, Bob +1btc
Bob-&gt;Sally channel : Bob -1btc, Sally +1btc
Sally-&gt;Anne channel : Sally -1btc, Anne +1btc.
Anne now has 1btc more, and John has 1btc less, but the net effect in each channel is simply a modification to the distribution of bitcoin in that channel.
Imagine this happening, back and forth, and extended to thousands, tens of thousands, and millions of people. As long as there's a chain between them, you use the chain. You might even have your transaction split over multiple chains. For links that don't have a chain, you create a channel on-the-fly.
Each channel, therefore, only ends up with the same single input, and the same two outputs, just differing values.
It's significantly more complex than that (transaction routing, and channel closure mechanics), but that's the idea. I wish I could remember the lightning dev that explained it. It really is very clever. I haven't actually questioned about the effect of having channels with multiple inputs (John/Sally) and outputs (Bob/Anne) at inception. Technically, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible. Just a much weirder set of ramifications.
I would suggest that the method for creating ln channels is most likely :  Carol wants to pay Bob 0.5btc.  She creates a ln channel with 1btc, of which Bob is allocated 0.5btc, and carol is allocated 0.5btc.  Bob gets paid 0.5btc that is accessible once confirmed.  Carol has 0.5btc that is now accessible once confirmed.  That way the ln can be bootstrapped by existing txns.
I'd also suggest that it would be easier to understand if Bob were Bob Inc.  The incentive will be for the buyer to reduce txn fees.  If Carol uses a store (coffee?) she will want to reduce paying those fees.   So she creates a channel with 0.1btc and 0.001 is allocated to Bob Inc. For the coffee she buys today, coffee + txn fee.  Ever more?  Zippo txn fee.   When your channel is almost zero, you buy bitcoin, it is delivered back to you by the rebalancing of that channel. And because it's Bob Inc the path through the channels from a source of bitcoin is reduced, maybe even two hops ( exchangeA/exchangeB -&gt; exchangeB/Bob Inc. -&gt; Bob Inc./Carol).

 The thing that it is counter-intuitive about crypto, is that the solution to electronic anonymous and censorship resistant money, turned out being record everything forever.  When someone can flick a switch and take everything from you, you don't have freedom.  When you can access the ledger from anyone, prove that it it is valid, and be able to send your money to anyone, for whatever purpose, you do.  
It is my opinion that this technology has been developed as a direct response to the insidious and anti-democratic implementation of AML/KYC laws on a global scale over the past 30 years.   The extrapolation of these laws, given a long enough timeline, is slavery.  Not figurative slavery, actual slavery.

You seriously do not know the definition of consensus.  It's bizarre, after all this time.  The consensus rules are defined within the node client.  You'd figure that you'd at least get some of this after such a length of time by osmosis.
[Here](  This is an example of the consensus rules :
1. The transactions syntax and data structure are correct.
2. The input and outputs have values.
3. The transaction is less than the block size of 1 MB.
4. The values must be more than 0 and less than 21 million.
5. None of the inputs have a hash that is equal to 0.
6. The locktime is less than the maximum allowed number.
7. The transaction size is greater than or equal to 100 bytes.
8. The number of signatures is less than the signatute limit.
9. The unlocking script can only push numbers onto the stack.
10. The locking script must match isstandard format.
11. A matching transaction must exist.
12. If a transaction is missing move the transaction to the orphan transaction pool.
13. If the transaction is a coinbase transaction then it must have a maturity of 100 confirmations.
14. For each input the output must exist and not have been spent.
15. Check that each input value is in the required range.
16. Reject if the input value is less than the output value.
17. Reject if the transaction value is too low to get into an empty block.
18. The unlocking scripts for each input must be verified against the output locking scripts.

That was a large transaction size (1623 bytes).  By current mining fees, that should equate to a 0.00097 fee, and you paid a 0.00071 fee, which is about 70% of the cost.  So you didn't pay a high enough fee, and weren't confirmed in the next block.  It looks like your understanding of bitcoinfees is incorrect, and it was, in fact, in line with bitcoinfees.
So you had to wait a bit, but I can see now the txn went through fine.  If you want it faster in future, pay a higher fee.

Au contraire my dear sir.  If you have $1,000,000, and you have a choice between buying a house or holding a deflationary asset and renting instead, over time, which of these options requires you to expend more productive capacity?  The reason why real estate is as expensive as it is, is because of the exact reason of why holding  inflationary cash doesn't work.  Now take away the investment incentive (i.e. capital growth) of real estate.  What happens to the value do you think?

I expect channels to be formed almost any time anyone pays someone they don't have a channel link with.  Even if the distribution is 100% to the recipient, the sender is going to have another channel open when they either buy bitcoin or whether someone wants to forward bitcoin to them.  There will be an incentive to have as many channels as you can with people you trust.  Because only these people will have any clue that you are receiving bitcoin.

Reality says otherwise?  So how is BU faring these days?  How is segwit faring these days?  Notice a difference in how each of these implementations is faring?  My argument, which is based upon the understanding of nodes and consensus, explains the discrepancy, yours does not.  Yes?
So when I say they matter, and that is reflected in the activation of segwit, and you say they don't matter, and that is reflected in the activation of BU.  Except BU isn't activated, is it?  So perhaps you should reflect on the thing you say doesn't matter?

Lightning allows users to take a single bitcoin transaction, and use it over a finite space of time, in order to shift bitcoin back and forth, with no or vanishingly small transaction fees, as iou's between what are called 'lightning channels'. The actual transaction size will be the same as a normal transaction, with a flag that says it can only be committed to the blockchain at a specific time (or block depth). In effect, these lightning transactions are cryptographically signed 'iou's. The 'thousands' of back-and-forth iou changes are discarded when the channel is closed (massive privacy dividend), and only the aggregated change is committed to the blockchain. This is the great thing about lightning. It is a single transaction with as many inputs and outputs (one/two) as defined in the original transaction. Only the transaction values change.
Consider a channel link of this : John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne. Only the people next to each other in the chain have a 'channel open' with each other (John/Bob, Bob/Sally, Sally/Anne). Assuming each of the channels between all of the participants have adequate funds in order to achieve this, if John wanted to send 1btc to Anne. A transaction ledger would read :
John-&gt;Bob channel : John -1btc, Bob +1btc
Bob-&gt;Sally channel : Bob -1btc, Sally +1btc
Sally-&gt;Anne channel : Sally -1btc, Anne +1btc.
Anne now has 1btc more, and John has 1btc less, but the net effect in each channel is simply a modification to the distribution of bitcoin in that channel.
Imagine this happening, back and forth, and extended to thousands, tens of thousands, and millions of people. As long as there's a chain between them, you use the chain. You might even have your transaction split over multiple chains. For links that don't have a chain, you create a channel on-the-fly.
Each channel, therefore, only ends up with the same single input, and the same two outputs, just differing values.
It's significantly more complex than that (transaction routing, and channel closure mechanics), but that's the idea. I wish I could remember the lightning dev that explained it. It really is very clever. I haven't actually questioned about the effect of having channels with multiple inputs (John/Sally) and outputs (Bob/Anne) at inception. Technically, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible. Just a much weirder set of ramifications.
I would suggest that the method for creating ln channels is most likely : Carol wants to pay Bob 0.5btc. She creates a ln channel with 1btc, of which Bob is allocated 0.5btc, and carol is allocated 0.5btc. Bob gets paid 0.5btc that is accessible once confirmed. Carol has 0.5btc that is now accessible once confirmed. That way the ln can be bootstrapped by existing txns.
I'd also suggest that it would be easier to understand if Bob were Bob Inc. The incentive will be for the buyer to reduce txn fees. If Carol uses a store (coffee?) she will want to reduce paying those fees. So she creates a channel with 0.1btc and 0.001 is allocated to Bob Inc. For the coffee she buys today, coffee + txn fee. Ever more? Zippo txn fee. **When your channel is almost zero, you buy bitcoin, it is delivered back to you by the rebalancing of that channel. And because it's Bob Inc the path through the channels from a source of bitcoin is reduced, maybe even two hops ( exchangeA/exchangeB -&gt; exchangeB/Bob Inc. -&gt; Bob Inc./Carol).**

No.  It's meant to be a store of value.  Until reserve banks, that used to mean money. And unless the miners implement segwit that's what its going to continue to be. And I'm ok with that.

Stop relying upon other people to do your calculations for you.  This is what I do :
I don't use fee estimations.  I look at [bitcoin fees]( see the size of the pool at X/satoshi's/byte, and see if the number of unconfirmed transactions at that value is less than the number that have been confirmed in the past 24 hours.  Then I make sure i use an RBF transaction.
Not often I pay more than 30 satoshi's per byte.  I've paid 50 a couple of times, and I think I remember I went up to 100 once.

The purest fundamental : supply and demand.  Bitcoin has a utility that no other asset class has.  Very few people who start acquiring bitcoin for its utility stop wanting or requiring that utility, so there is less bitcoin available to sell.

@_date: 2017-03-13 08:27:01


And yet rbtc numpties say that regularly.  I was simply highlighting that they declare that both outcomes will happen.


See above?


But they'll be worth less.  When everyone just decides to stop paying fees at all, that isn't going to lead to too many fees, now is it?
And then you sacrifice decentralization, and hand over bitcoin to a chinese company, bitmain.
Emergent consensus, the block-size setting mechanism in ChinaBU, lets miners decide, through force of hash, the block size. This provides for them an incentive such that, as they increase the block-size, it leads to the nodes not being able to be run except with massive connections to the other nodes and miners. The miners that are closer (in bandwidth) to the other nodes, will have more time to retrieve the transaction and block data. Nodes and miners on slower connections will further deplete, as they can't source the data fast enough. This will also mean that communication between miners will favor miners that are closer together.
This means, by design, bitmain will be able to force ALL miners and ALL nodes off of the network, and every node and every miner will be housed in bitmain data-centers.
I'm sure bitmain would like to be the single miner, and the single node provider of bitcoin.  But I'm not interested in bitcoin becoming china-coin thanks.

Not really that great dude.  Hey, I think it's great.  Wish there was more.
@_date: 2017-01-18 22:03:17
?  Ya, because you could redirect to miners with less hashing power i assume.  So if it were gamed, by controlling nodes, you could use less hashing power to achieve a 51% attack.  
But what's stopping you?  You wouldn't even need to change the node software. One big player like electrum could implement a segwit miner only policy for their nodes and non segwit miners would start to see their fees dry up.  The key is that they actually have to be functioning nodes.  They must be accepting txns, otherwise the incentive is gone.  Would the mempool even "allow" this?
Surely this has been thought of before?

Only the group that doesn't change from the core-ref client is bitcoin.  If china-coin wants to create their new 2x client, they can.  Bitcoin nodes will remain unaffected.

If you don't get this, then bitcoin isn't for you.  Perhaps BCH might better suit?  Less nodes.


No.  It isn't.


I despair at someone that has to twist themselves into contortions because they can't admit that nodes define and police consensus in bitcoin, and therefore **it is nodes who decide which blocks to include in the blockchain, not miners.**  The nodes even define the PoW that the miners must apply.

That is never going to happen.  Even the threat of a uasf forced miners to adopt the consensus tightening that is segwit.  Bip141 happened because the miners modified their clients to align with the overwhelming number of nodes that were already segwit capable, not the other way around.  Miners follow nodes.  It is thus. It has always been thus.

I think a software change that &lt;10% of the network (nodes used for sending/receiving transactions) wants is an attack, and a software change that &gt;90% of the network wants is a software upgrade.  And that upgrade still can't disadvantage the other 10%, or it is an attack.

I'll stick with the network with the most decentralization of nodes, because more nodes maintaining consensus rules ensure you can't have your bitcoin stolen, so that is the most valuable network to own bitcoin in, and the safest network to use because of the lack of ability to censor transactions in, and therefore is the one that there is an incentive to mine in.
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:37:46


I don't care how much hashpower you think you have.  I will never install your hard-fork client.  You either produce blocks that bitcoin nodes will accept or you produce hashes for an alt that no one wants.  Your choice.  End of story.

That's exactly what they do.  What do you think people are referring to when they say "mempool"?  It is the pool of transactions that a node has that it is replicating with other nodes. 


What you should be doing is applying that exact logic to peers in bitcoin transactions.

@_date: 2017-08-21 10:29:49
Hard-forking is indeed a big problem.  It is my opinion that unless 100% of nodes agree to a consensus change that requires a hard-fork, it is the creation of an alt.  I am, in fact, working on what I think is a long-term proposal for that issue.
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:59:35


It doesn't matter whether you agree or not.  The 10's of thousands of nodes that make up the bitcoin network define bitcoin.




Over 100K at last count.




It's not surprising that a person who doesn't know what a node does doesn't know what a soft-fork is, and why for segwit it doesn't require all nodes.  That isn't the case, however, with the 2x hard-fork.  For a hard-fork, you need all.  Which is why it is never going to happen.

There isn't a problem doing it.  You just can't force people to accept your change, because 100,000+ core ref nodes need to be uninstalled, and a new node client must be installed and run in its place that has been developed by a small group of shady dickheads.

I actually think that report is a bit more nuanced than just 'bitcoin=bad'.
Highlighting the fact that if you were a traditional money exchange, you would need to rely upon technologies that might not be adequately understood is a perfectly legitimate warning that a body like this should be making.  Their warnings specifically about a group that might leverage this lack of knowledge in order to expose you to risk, is definitely a concern.
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:46:42




The fact that you don't know the answer to that question means you should probably reflect on why.


Every block will be rejected.  People running bitcoin nodes will remain unaffected.


You really should learn how bitcoin works then.  Once you do, you'll understand just exactly what the decentralization of nodes means, and how much power they exert on bitcoin.  Indeed, it is this decentralization of nodes that separates it from every other crypto, and makes it the hardest for any corporate interest to control, for exactly this reason.

Bitcoin "support" can't be measured by design.  But that  doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  It is defined by the number of nodes that are used to send and receive bitcoin.   The only thing you know is when you dont have support, because the nodes don't accept your transaction, because it doesn't meet consensus rules.  And then you have an alt. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 04:54:19

?  Can't see it.  One of the strengths of uber is that it attaches the person and the driver to their performance.  If a user is dick-head that likes abusing people, he or she won't be picked up.  If a driver doesn't know what a shower is, he's not going to be driving for long.  By tying people to their credit cards, you tie people to their historical interactions.  For women taking these things at night, it adds another level of risk management.
I think the worst possible thing would be to anonymize uber.

Fail trains 1, 2, 3, with 4 underway (XT/Classic/BU/BCH) would lead one to question that confidence.   I'm fairly confident that 10's of thousands of current core-ref node clients won't be uninstalled and a new closed-development, unreviewed, untested, and untrusted node client developed by shysters and charlatans installed to replace those 10's of thousands of nodes.

No it isn't, it's about the government being able to capture the bitcoin in coinbase and there's sfa you could do about it.  You shysters then wanna talk about some proprietary product name that accounts for 2% of the coins stored with coinbase, and not the other 98% that are held offline by their own admission and you have fuck all chances of retrieving if the government decided to take them.  Something that they have done before to a similar asset class. 
Ffs.  
@_date: 2017-01-05 00:54:52
So people who use coinbase for a wallet should be restricted from using their bitcoin during times of increased demand?  Yet another reason why you should never store your bitcoin on an exchange.

I A minimum of one year, and preferably two, of investigation, of the effects of the segwit blocksize increase.  And then an analysis of those effects by technical experts that finds the upper bound safety limit at that time. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 03:20:17
I don't try to time the market, and never have.  You either recognize the long-term value proposition of bitcoin, or you don't.  If you do, it doesn't make any difference when you buy.  If you don't, it doesn't matter what the price is, because it's not an investment instrument that you value at any price.
What you need to do is test our your bitcoin transfer, storage, backup and retrieval processes, and you should be doing this with small amounts until you're comfortable that you know what you're doing.  Bitcoin is extremely unforgiving.  You can lose all of your money instantly if you don't know what you're doing, and that doesn't even mention bad actors stealing your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:30:06

Always accept bitcoin as payment if the option is available to you.  But ensure that the address that you receive at is separated from your other bitcoin.  That way the person sending you bitcoin can't figure out how much you have by querying the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:25:58
 But they won't run my node. Nor will they run 99% of nodes.  So 99% of nodes will reject transcribes created by china-coin nodes.

10's of thousands of core reference nodes that are currently in operation, are not going to be uninstalled within three months, and a new node client from a completely untrusted software development group, is not going to be installed and run in its place.
It is just never going to happen.
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:04:06
It isn't just "users".   It is node users.  In order for a hard-fork to be successful 100% of the nodes, [tens of thousands of them]( have to physically uninstall their node clients, never run them again, and install a new node client that has different consensus rules. There are 1000s of node clients still at 0.8.  They are probably never going to change their node client, even to a newer node client that is compatible with the same consensus rules. And it is these (probably fabulously wealthy) people who will just continue using bitcoin. 
Anyone who creates a new set of consensus rules has just created as alt. It is that simple. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:25:51

That is clearly too low a miner fee, and has been an insufficient fee for at least a year.  Only you can decide if the 12c you saved is worth the time you wait.

I find it wholly consistent that any white nationalist movement harks back to the past through rose colored glasses, to a different time in which they had more control over their destiny.  Usually when there were less brown people.  Or, at least, less brown people near them.  "Make America great again" and all that. So which part of America being great again are you seeking to bring back?  Coups?  Torture?  Selling drugs to fund terrorism? Lynchings?  Slavery?  All of em?  Back when black people knew their place? I think if you ask around a few of your rallies, you'll find broad support.  How many people have you executed this year, anyway?  I mean the official ones, not the unarmed black ones. 


It is Australia's shame alright.  The same white nationalist populism as it turns out.  I'm not a fan, or a supporter.  A protester even.  I suppose that is one of the things that separates you and me.  You know what the bizarre thing is about that policy? It's supposed to be for their safety.  Too many kept drowning on the trip.  Bullshit of course. But the policy isn't about being overrun, it's supposedly about stopping people drowning in boats by ensuring there is no incentive to try.  Its amazing the twisted logic of racism. All egged on by newscorp, or as you know it, foxnews.  Any attempt to change it and rupert murdoch turns on the hate engine. 
It used to be worse of course.  We had the white Australia policy.   And our colonial history could give you Americans a run for your money.  We also had a prime minister that apologised for all Australians at the treatment of the indigenous people of Australia, some of which are my relatives. 
It's called taking responsibility.  You should try it.  It's quite cathartic.

I will not downgrade my security to the china-coin node client.  I, and every other node user, will migrate to a different PoW before they accept miners dictating consensus code changes.  And you will find out how fast core can deliver a hard-fork if an attack on the bitcoin blockchain is ever attempted.
Options :
1. Don't do a hard-fork and test segwit to see if a hard-fork is required.
2. Do a hard-fork the safe way with core in a multi-year timeline 
3. Fork off to china-coin in yet another alt and continue on with option 1.
3. Do a hard-fork to a new PoW with core if the bitcoin blockchain is attacked.
Your choice.

Lots of ways, if you bothered looking.  [Here's an example]( which is later expanded upon [here](  This is the type of functionality that segwit provides.  But you lot never do look, or think, or god-forbid, attempt to come up with solutions, because you lot are so fixated on the words 'hard-fork' that you don't really pay much attention to anything else.
Let me give you an example.  Remember classic?  Remember what the big push was for?  It was a push for a 2mb hard-fork.  Because it was needed RIGHT NOW.  Then some bright spark came along (mostly Luke Dashjr) and said "hey, I can get that capacity increase and greater by a soft-fork, by re-configuring the block format for segwit."  Suddenly, that hard-fork wasn't necessary anymore.  Even more of a capacity increase could be delivered via a soft-fork.
But you know what didn't change?  The people still clamoring for a hard-fork.  The only people who actually support a hard-fork right now are people who don't actually know what consensus is as it relates to bitcoin.  Most of them (probably including you) don't even know the difference between a soft-fork and a hard-fork.
So let me fill you in on a brutal truth :  **A hard-fork without 100% support of the nodes that are used for sending and receiving transactions, is the creation of an alt.**  That's what BCH is.  The creation of an alt, because the nodes that define and police consensus don't support their consensus rule changes.
You start recognizing that reality, and I'll start taking the time to explain ways that that reality can be alleviated.

The point is, that that 'if' can't be resolved, and as it can't be resolved, the statistical linking is impossible, except to say "Supply of coins to sell" &lt;= "Supply of coins"
There is a practical consideration for this.  The market cap of bitcoin (or any other crypto) is a made-up number.  It is in, in practice, impossible to liquidate that market-cap.  In practice, the price of bitcoin (or any other crypto) relates only to its liquidity ("supply of coins to sell right now").  There's no way to use either "supply of coins to sell" OR "supply of coins" to determine how much money could be extracted from bitcoin (or any other crypto) even if there was only one owner of "supply of coins to sell".

If people behind the nodes decide to abandon a set of consensus rules, and decide to adopt a different set of consensus rules, because they all talk to one another, it is them who decide what they will and what they will not accept as a transaction.  And there's nothing anyone can do about it.

Scalability had been blocked for years by miners.  It will be fixed soon enough now that the blockage to segwit has been removed.

On the assumption that this is loaded...
 Security.  Your method relies upon the security of the node and wallet implementation of bch.  Move it first, and because the bch chain will never see the txn made on the btc blockchain, that is not an issue. 
If he dumps those bch coins tho, the bch price is probably going to tank. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 05:54:00
There's a chance they'll choose the 2x fork with 150 nodes and bitmain, instead of remain on the bitcoin chain with 100,000+ nodes.  They are unsafe to use until that is rectified.
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:01:06
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:40:13


 No.  But you'll be just as effective with your new fail trains as you have with last four (soon to be five) fall trains.  (XT / classic / BU / bch / 2x )
How is BU coming along these days, anyway?

That makes it a really good joke.
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:17:50


Nodes define consensus in bitcoin, not miners.  Which is why segwit is activating and bch is an alt coin. 


Fork away.  Go for your life.  I think I'll just continue using bitcoin.

Because you don't understand how bitcoin works, you fail to understand the logistics of a hard-fork.  It is not about the change, it is about the logistics of decommissioning tens of thousands of existing bitcoin core ref nodes, and replacing them with untrusted, unreviewed, untested software written by shysters and charlatans. 
It is never going to happen. 
@_date: 2016-11-08 09:24:59
I'm more pragmatic.  I'm just trying to make sure that the people that don't have set views recognize that there are other points of view.

Yep.  There are node owners, which police and enforce consensus, and then there are the people who require them to continue being node owners.  The people who maintain the decentralized network, and the people who use bitcoin at their sufferance. Want to protect your money?  Run a node.  The more bitcoin you have, the more important it is to do so.

I have listened.  You haven't presented any arguments.  I'm explaining to you how nodes and consensus work in bitcoin, and you bring up completely unrelated things that only confuse you.  
Stick to what matters.  Nodes define and police consensus in bitcoin.  As long as you recognize that reality, we can talk about bitcoin.  If you don't, then I don't know what you're even trying to discuss.

@_date: 2017-08-28 03:04:59


Yes I did.


The only unfortunate thing in that scenario is the miners that get their hardware effectively bricked that didn't contribute to the PoW change.  The only question for bitcoin users is, do you want to reward the attackers of the chain by giving them all of your money, or do you upgrade to a new consensus client that continues being bitcoin?  It is, after all, what node client people choose to use to spend their money that defines what consensus rules are applied.
The fact is, miners know this, and the only thing likely to happen in the short-term would be that Wu would be led out into a paddy field to receive a bullet in the back of the head for losing hundreds of millions of dollars.  I've never assumed he was that stupid.

I have never subscribed to that theory.  I buy when i want to buy.  The price is immaterial to me. If you subscribe to the long term value proposition of bitcoin in the future, the price it is today doesn't really matter, only your appetite for risk.  If you don't, perhaps you shouldn't be buying bitcoin at all.

Any wallet is better than a web wallet.  With a web wallet you might as well be rolling dice with your bitcoin.  Blockchain.info has known unfixed vulnerabilities. 
What separates electrum from  some other wallets is that it is open source.  It's not unique, but it has been a reliable wallet for almost the entire time of bitcoin.  Short of running your own node, i think electrum both desktop and Android wallet, are the most reliable wallets available.  You can even configure them to only talk to nodes you personally control, when you decide to accept a lower risk profile.

Yes, but we were talking about a hard-fork.  It's the title of the thread that you started, is it not?  Suddenly, you're not a newbie, you're an expert on user requirements, that doesn't want to talk about nodes, which define consensus in bitcoin, the rules of which define a hard-fork.
So do you want to talk about hard-forks?  Or not?

As long as they arent explicit about whether they are going to follow the 2x fork, instead of staying with the nodes, they should be avoided at all costs.  You are opening yourself up to having your bitcoin stolen by using their infrastructure. 
If they cannot say "we will not follow the 2x fork without replay protection." then you know your funds are not safe.

What's with the negativity here people?  Sheesh. 
For better or for worse NY is the largest financial hub in the world. If some megalomaniac nubfkr makes a regulation that the people of NY have to abide by, that's between the people of NY and the megalomaniac nubfkr. There is a LOT of money in NY.  This simply means that those people can legitimitely buy bitcoin from a regulated company for their retirement accounts, or more importantly, retirement trust managers can do so.

I'm not really.  I'm reflecting your logic back on you.  Killing a few hundred thousand people in iraq because you wanted to test out your weapons (because there weren't any decent targets in afghanistan, [as rumsfeld put it]( and steal their oil isn't exactly ancient history, especially when it leads to the very humanitarian crisis that you capitalize on in your white-nationalist populist movement.  iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 (or anything else really) and when he was gassing his own people, he was an ally of yours, so I don't really think the WMD was a valid excuse.  Ditto Al-qeda.  Formed by the US government as a guerilla movement in afghanistan in order to overthrow the russians.  Ditto Iran, when in [1953 the US and UK governments overthrew the democratically elected government]( and installed the shah, which directly led to the islamic revolution and the birth of the terrorist state.  Oh, and you remember Norman Shwarzkopf?  He was but a fresh-faced Lt.Colonel that [trained the shah's secret police in Iran (SAVAK)]( that tortured and murdered tens of thousands.  He moved there in 1955, two years after the coup, with his CIA team of torture trainers.  He, and I quote "trained virtually all of the first generation of SAVAK personnel", which made him the perfect person to lead desert storm.

There are lots of reasons why big blocks are problematic. I'm simply pointing out the ramifications of them on decentralization.  That is reason enough to treat it as the dangerous parameter it is.  Without decentralization and censorship resistance, bitcoin is useless.  Without decentralization you need to rely on trust.  Without having the option of validating your own transactions you have to trust that others won't censor yours.

I agree this is a difficult question.  However, we're not talking pre-fork, we're talking post-fork.  If core decided to create fork code that there was a legitimate non-core base of node users that were not interested in adopting new consensus rules, it is core that would be the fork.  Indeed, it's possible that there might never be another change to the protocol that requires the type of coordination that is required for a hard-fork.

You know what's going on in your head? It's called [cognitive dissonance](  It is the discrepancy between your hero worship and the reality that that hero of yours is fkn crazy. It is making you unconformable because deep down, you know it, yet you refuse to believe it, because to do so will challenge a number of your core beliefs.  Personally it's always fascinating to see people turn themselves inside out trying to justify their belief structures, because they know they can't be defended, and just start getting increasingly whacky trying to deflect away from the thing that makes them most uncomfortable. 
But it doesn't change anything of course.  Ver is fkn crazy.  The judge knew it.  Hell the court even dictated he had to attend therapy on his release from prison, and remarked on his abusive childhood and its  effect on his cognition, which, if you didn't know, is a key indicator for many with bipolar disorder. The lawyers certainly knew it.  He knows enough to know something isn't right, but not enough to not sell bombs over the Internet. Even you know it.  You really need to learn to act accordingly. Ver has limited capacity to control the way he acts which is why mood stabilizers and anti psychotics exist. It doesn't make him less of a person. Lots of people have these conditions. Carrying on like they don't exist doesn't help anyone though, least of all him.

As a practicality, I use it to pay for my VPN.  I don't like handing over my credit card details to anyone on the internet, and bitcoin allows me to purchase things without the need for handing over that information.
But primarily, for me, it's an inflation hedge and a secure savings account.  If I were to move to a new country, I wouldn't need to change my bank accounts, and there's no way I could be forced to disclose my savings to any country that I chose to move to.  And americas civil asset forfeiture is not ever going to be an issue for me, and as we all know, you don't have to be guilty of anything in america anymore for the police to steal your money.  It is my belief that its use in this regard will be recognized even more as time goes on.  But everyone will have their own reasons for using it (or not) and that's the great thing about it.

That makes no sense at all.  Miners either produce blocks that satisfy consensus rules, or they are rejected, and they do not receive bitcoin.   nodes police this consensus.   Bitcoin is valuable.  So miners do their job to get paid.  If they choose to mine a different chain, they can.  They just won't be paid in bitcoin.  Who holds those consensus rules? Nodes.  Who validates that consensus rules have been applied? Nodes.  Who defines the pow that miners may employ?  Nodes.  Do what the nodes want or don't get bitcoin.  Simple. 


Yeah.  They will.  There is no grey area.

@_date: 2017-01-25 10:19:04
So no. My point.  
An increase in block size is linearly correlated with the upload bandwidth requirements of a node.  You double the block size, you double the upload bandwidth requirements. [This utility]( will show you how much upload bandwidth is required to run a node, and what that upload bandwidth requirement is if you change the block size.
Those blocks will be full almost instantly.  Because a blockchain without a fee-market is a free permanent storage device.  But not only that, the upload bandwidth requirement for a node is already at the point where anywhere except a relatively minor portion of countries wouldn't be able to handle the increase.  That means regular companies or people that don't have specialist bandwidth contracts with their ISP's (and, for the record, that's 90% of the people in Australia at any price) will immediately never be able to run a node again.  That means users must trust other people running  nodes. Congratulations, you have just managed to decrease security, decrease decentralization, and remove regular people from validating their own transactions in bitcoin. 
Now do you understand?
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:08:07

It's actually pretty straight forward.  You should probably read the white paper. You essentially exchange a key between the parties that prove that only an authorized person could have made the purchase, and you record that exchange in a channel. The design of LN really has to do with the method of closing channels and ensuring bad actors can't benefit from a lack of connectivity.  The key exchange stuff isn't what is ground breaking about the tech.  Plenty of other cryptos could handle the key exchange process.

If you want to build a road you need ditch diggers to dig ditches, but you can always get different ditch diggers if they don't want to work for the  money they are offered.  What you dont do is get the ditch diggers to design the road, dictate the money they are to be paid to dig ditches, and then give them the road.

You know, until i pressed send there, i didn't realize that it was this thing that you didn't know about consensus.  Consensus in bitcoin isn't about agreement, it's about acceptance.  You either accept the consensus rules in that network, or you work apart from it.

He views even the desire for a change to the protocol as a vector of an attack, which opens up other vectors of attack, not the least of which is normalizing the expectation of more changes to the protocol.  There is actually a consistency to that argument, and it is unwise to dismiss it out of hand.

What you need to understand is the role that nodes play in the security of bitcoin.  The fact that you don't know this, is the only reason why you say what you say.  Once you learn that role, you will not say the things that you're saying.

I edited to say that I agree that at the beginning and for some length of time, the values should be aligned.  Which I think you actually want to do.  Over time, as less value remains on the old chain, as coins are shifted to the new one, and transactions become less and less common, the incentive for mining will be to mine on the new chain.
My point for this though, is to not be coercive.  There is an incentive to use the new chain (less mining centralization for one), and there is SFA a miner could do about it.

The person who put it there said nothing about it being temporary.  Anyone who says otherwise is just making shit up, or parroting someone who is.

You'll find that there is continuous confusion and argument so long as you use the redefinition of "Full, except..." to mean "Full".
I read the [link]( you provided.  It doesn't say anything about the exceptions you assert.  If you want to get all technical and shit :


... downloads?  From where?  That doesn't say anything about providing a cheap piece of plastic, now does it?  It says 'download', and in the context of the bitcoin network, that means download from other nodes.  If there aren't any full nodes, and there are only pruned nodes, that means, according to the definition you provided, you're sort of fucked, aren't you?  The cheap piece of plastic allows you to short-cut that process, so bonza.  But according to the established for five years definition, a full-node downloads the data from other full-nodes.
A full-node is a full-node.  It's actually quite easy to understand.

Dare i use a quote from dune?  Those who can destroy a thing control a thing.  
Who do you think understands forks better?  Contributers to core, the creators and maintainers of consensus systems? Or miners, businesses locked to one consensus system?
There is no outcome that doesn't involve failure for miners locked to a consensus system, in a battle against the creators of consensus systems, for who defines consensus systems. One side has all of the guns and all of the bullets.  The miners are entirely dependent upon the algorithm that is accepted by the nodes that the consensus system creators write.  And they know it. 
The only reason why the current consensus system is even accepted, is because there is a respect given for the amount of investment of all of the players in mining.  There are malicious miners, but they are concentrated.  Most miners just want to anonymously mine their coins and be left alone. And they are terrified that their investment will become worthless. 
And here is where we are.

The proof-of-work is the mechanism to ensure it is more difficult to undo transactions than it is to do them.  The 'work' is application of energy in the form of electricity applied to an algorithm.  Each new block means that it is exponentially more difficult to undo the transactions of the previous block, and each block further back it becomes exponentially more difficult again.
If someone comes along and says "hey, that transaction is wrong, this is the right one", the nodes validate whether the new block has more energy that has been put into it, and it it doesn't, it is rejected.

I'm happy with it, one of the reasons for which, is that it is finally going to teach the miners who is in control of bitcoin development.  As bitcoin doesn't scale because of their obstruction, and hashpower continues to increase, the miners will see their investment dollars flushing down the toilet.  As the non censored store of value, bitcoin will continue its stranglehold.  They won't be able to afford newer and faster asics with the money they will be losing.  Many people will acquire the faster asics over time, and will be quite happy to run them at a loss.  Bye bye obstructing miners. I'm prepared to wait for them to continue hemorrhaging money as they wonder where it all went wrong.

You don't know the meaning of the word.  
Nodes define and police consensus in bitcoin, not miners.  The only consensus amongst nodes is for segwit.  2x is never going to happen, because it would require 10's of thousands of current core-ref nodes to uninstall that node client software, and install a new closed development, unreviewed, untested and untrusted node client within three months.  Or, there might be a fork, but bitcoin will remain as unaffected by that fork as it is by the bcash fork, for exactly the same reason.

But it doesn't matter what you think.  10's of thousands of core reference nodes that are currently in operation, are not going to be uninstalled within three months, and a new node client from a completely untrusted software development group, is not going to be installed and run in its place.

@_date: 2016-12-27 01:44:50
And I'm saying don't invest in bitcoin until you do know.  Buying $100 worth to play with isn't investing, it's figuring it out.  Use that time to figure out how to select/install/create/destroy/recover/store wallets, and once you do that, THEN, if you want to, invest in the product.  And at that point, you move your coins from the exchange as soon as you buy them.
So my advice to those people would be don't invest until you know what you're doing.  An exchange like coinbase is an illusory safety-net.  It's safe right up until it isn't.  A big WTF possibility for coinbase is that the regulatory system makes it illegal immediately in the US.  If you have a well regulated US company, that means your value disappears over night.  Ask an Indian how arbitrarily that type of regulatory change happens.  How do you explain THAT to the people you said it was ok to do?
Learn how to do it right, THEN invest.  That's what I did.  That's what I do.  That's the advice that I give, because that's the advice that I follow.
@_date: 2016-12-12 04:10:26
No I'm not.  I'm talking about a full node.  The definition used in this entire discussion doesn't even mention the word 'archival'


That's the definition that's been kicking around for years.  Don't blame me because you don't know it.  It's true that they are inefficient.  If you want to reduce the overhead of a node, and still want it to be fully validating, you can create a pruned node that only contains the unspent outputs.  But it ain't a full node anymore. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 07:04:01

Chinese culture is everywhere.  There is not a single country that I have lived in that does not have a chinese cultural component, and usually a very large one.  Except maybe Papua New Guinea?  I don't remember seeing one there.  If you wanna start drawing up a map of which culture is going to win the world?  Newsflash : Chinese culture already won.  Which is funny of course, because china is not one culture.
Don't confuse a government system with a culture, and definitely don't confuse either with the color of someones skin, or the shape of their eyes.  Otherwise you'll start to think america is just a bunch of red-neck racists.  Oh... that's right.

Not really.  You people have consistently over estimated your support.  You can't even decide if you're for or against segwit.  A legion of numpty sockpuppets that can't form coherent arguments is not a bedrock on which to form a consensus.


I don't really care what the employees of any bitcoin company thinks.  I care about the actions of core though.  I think they've got the balance right, but other stakeholders might view segwit as not conservative enough, and reject it.  I'm ok with that too.

PS+EDIT: a bit unfair calling bch developers numpties.  No.  Not that.  Out of their depth.  But meh.  Same thing applies to 2x though.  100k core ref nodes ain't gonna disconnect their nodes and activate the hard-fork without wipeout protection.  And they'll protect themselves from that attack.

I think it's really good that someone talks and accentuates the risk before the reward in this. 


Bitcoin is fantastic for what it does well.  There will always be a gambling element in any commodity, so getting people interested for its utility, requires recognition of risk. This is far more important than trying to convince people to use it because of its speculative value.

The person who put it there said nothing about it being temporary. Anyone who says otherwise is just making shit up, or parroting someone who is. It could have been placed there because he correctly surmised that the bandwidth requirements of a node would have been such that it would lead to centralization when the blocks start reaching capacity if it were larger.

I'm not calling it, but there probably needs to be a discussion about what the rule is?  Otherwise every cashed-up attacker with fork plans just floods the sub with FUD and pump/dump.  It should probably at least be recognized that this might be an issue.  You know... before it is an issue?  Like, you know... last time?
Perhaps a side-bar with a link to fork info?  For different forks that happen.  CLAMS is one isn't it?  BCH is another.  LTC is a code-fork, but not a chain-fork.  But anyway, not bitcoin.

Without full nodes holding the chain, other full nodes wouldn't find anything to validate. So the validation can't occur in the first place unless there are full nodes serving the data to validate.  
Thats the problem. Your mixed up definitions require further explanation because the ramifications of your incomplete understanding doesn't actually provide the validation you say it does.  
Full nodes are full nodes.  You wanna create non-archival nodes because you don't want to run a full-node?  Be my guest.  But you're not running a full node then.

First txn 16c for a 372 byte txn.  It should have been 28c or there-abouts for a next-block confirm.  So you'll have to be lucky to get into the next block.   But unless there's more spam that'll be between one and five hours.
Second txn 13c for a 373 byte txn.  It should have been 28c or there-abouts for a next-block confirm.   That's going to take a little longer.  Looking at bitcoinfees.21.co I guess that'll be somewhere between one and 12 hours.
So basically, for an additional 27c spread between both txn's, you would have had a next block confirmation.

I mean seriously.  Isn't it supposed to be antagonistic by design?
If all of the miners agree with the status quo, and they're earning, and expect to continue to earn, enough money to support the network as it stands, I'm saying job well done.  
If there is more value in the network by continuing on the current path, so be it. The price isn't saying it is not valuable.  The txn price isn't saying it is not valuable. 
Perhaps it will all take more time.   I'm ok with that. 
Maybe they're saying "don't fix what ain't broken."
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:47:14


Maybe because there they have the same lack of critical thinking skills?
The solution, of course, is to actually learn the subject of what you're talking about, and then you won't have people telling you you're ignorant all of the time.  I've taken a great deal of time to explain IN DETAIL where your understanding is lacking, and the only thing you've done is skim over it, and repeat the demonstrably false narrative.
**Just stop doing it.**  Stop thinking that your opinion of a subject is equivalent to my understanding of the subject.  I have shown you evidence that directly contradicts your statements, *and you don't even know the definitions of the words we're discussing*.  If you have a question, ask.  I did, when I didn't know something, I had it explained to me, and then I learned.  You have provided absolutely no insight, and the only thing this entire dialogue has shown is that you are entirely resistant to information that dismantles your argument.

@_date: 2017-08-01 02:43:48
Support in bitcoin is measured in the number of nodes that are used to make bitcoin transactions and enforce consensus rules.  It has nothing to do with the slimy words of shysters and charlatans.  
In order for 2x to be successful, 10's of thousands of current core ref nodes (as in, all of them) would need to be un-installed in three months, and a new node client developed behind closed doors, that is unreviewed, untested and untrusted, would need to be installed instead.  This is never going to happen.

You didn't say anything about 'finished'.  It's an [alpha release.](


This is the current feature list, not a future one.


























So.  Released and usable.  Looks like you owe 10btc.  But don't worry.  No one ever actually expected you to be a boy of his word.

Ethereum really has a benevolent dictator model.  Vitalik Buterim decides what happens with the protocol, and any nodes that can run (which is a serious issue) just do what he tells them to do.  It is becoming very difficult even now for nodes to sync because of the size of the ethereum blockchain.

I'm happy enough with the status quo.  Is not perfect, but nothing in the real world ever is.  Clearly most miners are happy enough too.  I'd like to see the malleability fix, but clearly that isn't important enough to people right now to justify an upgrade.  Perhaps that will change over the next year.

It's not a major concern to me now, but I recognize it as a problem.  It is one of the reasons why I'm such of a supporter of segwit and lightning, and following on from that atomic swaps.

Up until recently, that meant a full node.
Wouldn't it be easier to just create a graph?

- FuncA = Fully Validate
- FuncB = Incoming Cxns
- FuncC = Serves Entire BlockChain
- etc.
- etc.
My opinion is 'full-node' is all of them.  Hence 'full'.
You might even rank them of 'incoming cxns' = "1 &lt; 12 &lt; inf." and have different node classifications.

Segwit has garnered more than double the support from the miners and the community *in one week* than a year of bullshit proposals in the from XT, Classic, and BU.
So my question to the numpties that are still tirelessly trying to undermine progress, and push their failed solutions that no-one wants.  If you can't get people to do what you want, why can't you accept that it's because most people (and all of the technical experts) don't want what you're selling? In a few days it's going to be triple. In a few weeks, if not sooner, it'll be five times. In a few months, if not sooner, it will be 10x. If 10x as many people (and all of the technical experts) are telling you that what they want isn't what you want, why are you incapable of accepting this?   Because ya can't negotiate with crazy, that's why.

 You still don't get it.  Now that segwit is activating i can say it. 
You know why BIP148 was successful?  Because correctly surmised that miners had more to lose.  I was prepared to burn the whole fucking house down rather than let mining interests control bitcoin. I, and most long term bitcoin holders that run nodes, don't care about 100 minute block times.  There are long term holders (like that quite simply do not care.  They do not care if bitcoin ever becomes a payment network. 
But it will now.  Because of the malleability fix of segwit. 
So you can fork off and fuck off.  Good riddance.  I'll just continue using bitcoin.

If the txn doesn't go to their wallet because it never gets in a block, it appears back in your wallet.  Without knowing the amount of inputs and outputs, and therefore workout knowing the amount of bytes in your txn, unless it's a particularly large amount, the txn will go through.  If it is a small size of bytes, it shouldn't be that long at all

When and if they hard-fork they will give you tokens of an alt and will not accept bitcoin.  There's also a chance that because they are not implementing replay projection, that they will steal bitcoin from people who aren't aware of their duplicity.

Because proof-of-work has incentives at cross purposes between nodes (i.e. owners) and miners.   Nodes don't trust miners, but miners have an incentive to deliver a service, by being rewarded in assets by nodes.  Nodes don't have financial return, and their incentive is having sound money.
Proof-of-stake has incentives that reward owners.  So you have to trust the larger owners of no dispossessing you of your assets.

Simply saving the site as a HTML means you can include the tool with the key, and it can be opened on any browser.

Lolwut?  Mr maxwell, i have the utmost respect for you, and i mean that, but in this thing, you are wrong.  Now it's a beautiful sunny day here in oz, so I'm at my local pub now, and therefore on my phone.  So forgive the auto corrects.   But here goes :


No, you seriously dude.  Eight hours ago you were saying there is a longstanding definition of a full node, and you provided a link to it. Then, when confronted with an explicitly different definition from your assertion to that source, the supposed longstanding definition now has a brand new new and improved definition.  I get it.  A new very good and useful feature was added that could reduce the overhead of a node that would still allow it to provide its validation function.  Bonza.  Well done. 


And this is the actual issue.  No.  A full node has functions.  Lots of them.  Communicating with other nodes is another one of them.  It shouldn't come as any surprise that you, who is intimitely involved in the security component of bitcoin, views it through that lens. But that isn't the only function of a node.
You have just stated that your understanding changed after the implementation of pruning.  Newsflash.  Other people's definitions didn't change. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 01:21:30
Take traffic = x.  Take nodes = y.  Let's say traffic = 10mb/s.   Let's say there are 10 nodes.  That's 1mb/s per node.  Now let's sequentially remove 1 from the nodes and find out what that does to the traffic per node.
Here :  [I drew you a graph](
You know what they call it when that line curves like that?  
As nodes drop out because of increased requirements, the nodes remaining have to increase the effort per node, and that increase per node is exponential.  Unless nodes increase linearly with users and miners, the resources required per node increase exponentially.  That leads to more drop-outs, and exponentially increased requirements on the remaining nodes.  It's called a [feedback loop](

I would suggest that the method for creating ln channels is more likely : 


Bob gets paid 0.5btc that is accessible once confirmed.  Carol has 0.5btc that is now accessible once confirmed.  That way the ln can be bootstrapped by existing txns.
I'd also suggest that it would be easier to understand if Bob were Bob Inc.  The incentive will be for the buyer to reduce txns.  If Carol uses a store (coffee?) she will want to reduce paying those fees.   So she creates a channel with 0.1btc and 0.001 is allocated to Bob Inc. For the coffee she buys today, coffee + txn fee.  Ever more?  Zippo txn fee.   When your channel is almost zero, you buy bitcoin, it is delivered back to you by the rebalancing of that channel. And because it's Bob Inc the path through the channels from a source of bitcoin is reduced, maybe even two hops ( exchangeA/exchangeB -&gt; exchangeB/Bob Inc. -&gt; Bob Inc./Carol).

Try reading what i said.  You live in la la land if you think a hard fork will ever be accepted in the current climate.  There are only a small portion of people currently blocking segwit and scalability, which is  what almost all other users of bitcoin want.  You think that support is going to magically reverse?  This has already been tried with XT, Classic, and BU.  If that overwhelming majority of users has segwit blocked, do you think they're suddenly going to support the people that blocked what they wanted?  Ha!  Hahaha!

I use this to explain the size of the gamut of possible addresses in bitcoin.
Imagine you were playing darts. Now imagine your dart board was the size of a strand of DNA. Now imagine someone hides that DNA strand sized dart board in a random place in the universe.  Any place.  Center of a sun.  Edge of the universes event horizon.  Your chance of guessing any working bitcoin address is less than the chances of you hitting that DNA strand sized dart board if you threw your dart.
The chances are even lower than that... but you get the idea.  When i said less chance that less chance is even more remarkable. There are 10^80 bitcoin addresses for every atom in the universe. The only reason i chose a DNA strand was because 220 million atoms would encompass all used addresses there have ever been. I could have said a universe within each atom, and it would still be right.

It could go through on the wrong chain.  From what I understand, relay protection has been implemented into bch, but if someone is malicious, and using an old node configuration, it's possible (extremely unlikely, but still...) that they could steal your bitcoin, if the transaction you sent was broadcast to the bch chain incorrectly.
You really just need to make sure you're using a uasf node, and you're probably as close as you can to being secure.  If you're using a node directly, these are not major concerns.

No.  A hard-fork without replay protection will enable the theft of anyone who doesn't change their node client.  It is an attack that will enable theft of peoples bitcoin.  That is what 2x is.  Its position is "uninstall your core reference node client or we will steal your bitcoin."

They have 11 months to come around. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 16:08:13
In months you couldn't get 10% support for your solution, and in two days core has doubled it.  Since viabtc announced support for your implementation, they've lost over 30% of their hashing power, while the total hashing power of the network has increased by over 10%.  
If you can't get people to do what you want, why can't you accept that it's because most people (and all of the technical experts) don't want what you're selling?  In a few days it's going to be triple.  In a few weeks, if not sooner, it'll be five times.  In a few months, if not sooner, it will be 10x.

Because it would be effectively impossible to implement that type of change.  You'd need a hard-fork, and you'd be screwing the miners, so there's no way that people would agree to it.  Then there's the incentive to have both mining and nodes being the same company which, yet again, increases centralization.  And those are only two of the obvious issues.  There are other ones that are probably even more problematic, but are harder to convey.
That's the thing : It works like it is.  Unless effectively everyone agrees to a change, it isn't going to change.

No, I disagreed with everything, and that was one of the examples that I could use that would best convey that point.  I focus on the big thing that's wrong, because you use that as a justification for being even more incorrect as you progress on from that incorrect assertion.

You're drinking the kool-aid.  If, after 11 months, and a vast majority of the hashing power signals segwit, the miners in control will simply build blocks on segwit transactions, and force them off of the network.  If they are a pool (which they mostly are) their miners will abandon them simply because of the threat.  
Do I think that'll happen?  No.  But you are one of the numpty-set if you think that a majority of mining power and the network is going to stand idly by and watch a small group of fkn morons stand in the way of bitcoin progress.

What i do is use electrum on a home pc.  Then i use a private key in my electrum wallet in mycelium.  So even i lose my phone i can still access the funds directly through electrum.  This is only really suitable for small amounts, because there is a pretty vanishingly small security risk, but it's there.  It works as my hot wallet solution though. 
And, of course, i back up the electrum keys.

@_date: 2017-08-24 03:00:05
That's because it didn't require any users to update their node software, because it was only miners opposing segwit.

There is no such thing.  There are nodes which enforce the consensus rules of bitcoin, and there is everything else that needs to talk to nodes in order to transact with the blockchain through those nodes.

Yes it does.  Later is 'now'.
You wanna bring up averages, go ahead, but the fact remains that unless you bought during that 11 day period where the price was higher, your value would be higher, if you hadn't sold.  And if you sold it today, unless you had acquired during those 11 days, the value you sold at would be higher.

Those fees only account for about 5% of the cost of running mining.  95% of the return of bitcoin from mining is achieved by the block reward.  Every 10 minutes 12.5 bitcoins are given to the miner that solves the 'hashing problem' that is a product of the transactions in a block.  Every four years or so there is a block-reward halving, so every year, the time in which mining must be supported by fees gets closer.  The current system doesn't 'kick the can down the road'.  It resolves it with the fee market.

Dude, you are everything but average. 
The questions you are asking are actually resolved, effectively, with segwit and lightning. When people say "several orders of magnitude" they really mean it.   3 tps to approximately 2000.  
But the question is whether the people who use the system as it is now, value it now more than what they think it might be worth in the future.  I can't tell them what to do any more than you can tell me what to do.  That is the underlying strength of bitcoin. The amount of effort it is to change.

The great side effect to the LN is that it also increases anonymity and censorship resistance because only the aggregated transactions get put on the blockchain.  They're all there in aggregated form but it's effectively impossible to unentangle them. 
I suspect this is one of the reasons that some bad actors are trying to undermine segwit.
@_date: 2016-12-03 22:52:24
Oh don't be so coy.  Every type of attack works against you. You can't figure out things like simple multiplication, and as i remember it, you were quite content calling **me** names when i was instructing you in it. Then you started changing the subject when you realized it. If you don't like being called a numpty, don't get into a math argument without knowing simple multiplication.
That's the problem with you numpties.  There are just so many things that are easy to attack.  You really should change that.

@_date: 2016-11-20 10:21:45

Bch forked bitcoin.   It sells for $300/coin.   Did that five billion just magically appear?  NEM has a market cap of 2.1 billion and 10 million volume, and that's high for it. They are an exercise in the incorrect use of numbers for making investment decisions.

Actually, I think it's 1000 users 500 payment channels.  Or less.  A channel is between two parties.  If A has a channel with B, and B has a channel with C, C doesn't need to open a channel with A to exchange as long as the funds within the A-B and B-C channels are such that a record in each of those channels can record a double-entry ledger record in both of those channels.  A pays B in the A-B channel, and B pays C in the B-C channel.

@_date: 2016-12-14 07:51:20


No, that's what nodes do.  Mining orders the transactions.  
The issue is the nodes.  The incentive for having one is simply that you can validate your transactions yourself without having to trust anyone.  But there is no financial incentive.  So increasing the number of transactions increases the resources required of a node.  The more those resource requirements increase, the more nodes 'drop off', and the load gets distributed amongst the remaining nodes.  Each node exponentially consumes more resources as less nodes share the load, and more nodes drop off.  If that happens enough, the only groups being able to support a node will be a small group of companies that can use that centralization to control bitcoin.
All of these numpties aren't concerned about that, because they really just want paypal 2.0.  They couldn't care less about the decentralized nature of bitcoin.  They really just want to have a big payday because they believe just because they call it a blockchain, a mass of users will suddenly adopt it if the evil developers of core were suddenly removed.  What they can't or won't recognize is that people have acquired bitcoin for what it is now.  It is the system as it is now that is valuable, as evidenced by the price of bitcoin, and the cost of transactions.

Completely disagree.  A full node is a full node. You wanna prune it, go ahead.  You've just created a pruned node. It is now a lower functioning node, because there's a key full node function that it no longer performs.  Other nodes that need to bootstrap the chain will have to go to a full node in order to do so. 


Yes.  From data managed by a full node. And if this data doesn't exist anymore? 


The point.  An exception to the rule.  You don't need to make exceptions if you understand that a full node is a full node. 
Pruned nodes perform a good function. Just not all of the functions that a full node performs.

@_date: 2016-12-13 11:02:28
Great explanation. 
@_date: 2019-10-30 02:42:21
For a total period of about two weeks in bitcoins 10+ year history would you be down by 50% with todays price.  For only two and a half months, 18 months ago, and the three months ending a month ago, would you ever have been in a worse value position.
So of 120 or so months of bitcoins life, there are about five in which you will have a negative value return, the maximum being 50% for two weeks, and for the other 115 months, you would be higher.
Bitcoin passed 5000 (about 50% of today) for the first time in mid october 2017.  That's 24 months between then and how.  We have five an a half months total in which it has been higher, about seven below, and the other 12 just middling.  So for 96 out of the 120 or so months of bitcoins existence, you would be double acquisition value (and in most cases much higher), and a total of 0.5 out of 120 months you would be half value.
  96 vs 0.5 (double+ / halve+)
  115 vs 5  (+ / -)
And you think you're somehow adding to this conversation.
The reality is that the big losers in the bitcoin space are the numpties who sold their bitcoin for alts, and are staring at 95%+ losses.  The people who stuck with bitcoin are doing just fine.  And you know what's funny?  If alts follow bitcoin by 10x up to 100K over the coming years, they still won't have achieved their all-time-highs.

Rule  : unless you control the private keys it isn't your money.  Do  NOT store your bitcoin on an exchange. 
Learn how to install/create/fund/spend from/receive to/backup/store/destroy/reinstall/restore a wallet. Until you can do those things bitcoin isn't for you.

I buy/sell and immediately move my money of an exchange as soon as it has cleared.  I use coinjar to buy, and I get an SMS notification when my incoming payment has cleared.  I immediately go onto the site, do the exchange, and then move the funds.
@_date: 2016-11-25 00:46:13
Yeah... that's why the fees keep rising.  Because no-one wants to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-10 03:48:50
In Australia they'd be fined for that.

Looks like it isn't gaining consensus then. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 00:21:35
yawn.  So let's start at the top of that conversation then shall we?








That last statement is the one from me.
So your debating skills align with your memory skills and your primary school mathematical skills?  Who wouldda thunk it eh?  It's almost like they're related.  Perhaps they suffer from the same root-cause?

You have me confused with someone else.




It seems you're easily confused.  But there's a special place called rbtc for people just like you.

To people who don't control consensus rules (i.e. nodes), everything is more important, either whole or in part, than the one thing that stops them demonstrating actual support.  Nodes define and police consensus in bitcoin.  If you can't get them to agree with your change, your 'support' means nothing.  It is that simple.
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:32:26

?  Que?  I think the markets are no more aware of a trump win/loss than any other person.  
I don't subscribe to all of this electoral doom and gloom.  I remember when Reagan was elected (who could possibly vote in a westerns actor?!!?!?) and the same things were said.  Voters disagreed.  Hell, this was happening at the same time as [a bunch of americans were held hostage in Iran after their embassy was stormed](  I mean, bloody hell, they voted in Bush... TWICE!  If anything, trump (if he were elected) would be a totally ineffectual president.  Perhaps that's a good thing?  Can't say...
But the world aint gonna be ending if either one of them wins.

Take traffic = x.  Take nodes = y.  Let's say traffic = 10mb/s.   Let's say there are 10 nodes.  That's 1mb/s per node.  Now let's sequentially remove 1 from the nodes and find out what that does to the traffic per node.
Here :  [I drew you a graph](
You know what they call it when that line curves like that?  
As nodes drop out because of increased requirements, the nodes remaining have to increase the effort per node, and that increase per node is exponential.  Unless nodes increase linearly with users and miners, the resources required per node increase exponentially.  That leads to more drop-outs, and exponentially increased requirements on the remaining nodes.  It's called a [feedback loop](

It means they all are partially socialist. The point. Americans, as a rule, don't really even understand what socialism is.

True in theory, but that means they have to shift their money out of the country.  That is the thing that is presenting a problem by some accounts.

@_date: 2019-10-30 00:39:33
Oh shush ya numpty.
There is a period of about three months once, and two and a half months once in which the price of bitcoin has been higher than it is today. The absolute WORST you could have done in bitcoin is if you bought once, during about a two week window two years ago, when you would be down 50%.
So that's about five months out of 120 months in which you wouldn't have increased your worth, and the worst possible case would be 50% down.  For the other 115 months you would be up, and by 1000's of percent, on average.
So if you don't like bitcoin, you know where the door is.  Use it.
PS.  There's zero chance you sold your bitcoin at 20k.  That level of salt you have comes from one place; Being a loser and wanting to blame everyone else for it.

People are paying to use this service, and they're paying money to acquire it.  There are many use-cases that are possible for bitcoin, but the one that makes people want to acquire it right now won't change, at least for the foreseeable future.  If that's enough to drive growth beyond what some stakeholder thinks might be achieved by change, that's their prerogative.  It is, clearly, paying to mine.

- Between the 11th and 22nd of December 2017
- December 27, 2017
- Between the 5th and 8th of January 2018
If we even wanted to be generous and say ~15K, that entire window of 15K+ was between the dates of December 8 2017 and January 9 2018, and that's not even counting the times it spent at 12K during that window.
You stupid fkrs can't do math.

I'm not the one re-defining the term "Full, except..." to mean the same thing as "Full".  And I don't need to acquire a cheap piece of plastic to make it work either.
Perhaps the fact that you think this constantly needs to be explained will give you some pause as to why that is the case?  You redefine terms like above, and find that your redefinition still isn't accepted, and have to continue to tell people that your redefinition is the one that people should adopt.
Here's an idea.  Don't try and re-define words, and you won't have to constantly explain your redefinition.
There's nothing wrong with peoples definition of a pruned node.  It's a fully validating node without the historical data.  It doesn't take extensive explanation, is quite easy to understand and convey, and you'll find that in spite of your redefinition of terms, that's what people easily understand.
PS+EDIT : Isn't it funny that I used exactly the same term "fully validating node" like did without even reading the other posts in this thread?  It's almost like people understand the definition of these words.

So.  Like I said.  Making shit up.
[Fees](  They're a bit lower than yesterday, but even today these txn's would be waiting.
txn bytes = 816 (a large one).  Fee paid = 0.0003264.  Way too low, about 1/3 of the mining fee required of about 60c.
txn bytes = 226.  Fee paid = 0.000113.  Way too low, about 1/2 of the mining fee required of 15c.
txn bytes = 226.  Fee paid = 0.000113.  Way too low, about 1/2 of the mining fee required of 15c.
See?  This is the great thing about bitcoin.  You can separate the people making shit up from the people who aren't because it's all in a public ledger.  If someone wants to save themselves 8c, they can wait for a miner to fit them in eventually.  If they want to pay an appropriate fee, they get confirmed in the next block.  It really is very simple.

Au contraire.  So it sounds to me like we are having a discussion about the intrinsic value of bitcoin.  So when people like to ask what the intrinsic value of bitcoin is, I say :
You are thinking of the store of value property without the cryptographic property that secures it. You are talking about it as one would talk about valuable shells, and even shell sellers, and not the security that separates it from all forms of value exchange before it. To understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin it is good to use the analogy of an envelope. So i ask you : does an envelope have intrinsic value?
If I have a letter that I need to send securely, would I prefer to send it open, and ready to be read? Or would I prefer for it to be sent within the confines of an envelope. Now let's think... would I prefer to just leave an open envelope, or would I think it necessary to put some seal across it to ensure that it isn't opened, and read whilst en-route. Does a sealable envelope have more intrinsic value than an unsealable one? Hmm... but what if someone can counterfeit the seal? I need some method of ensuring that the message I want to get to that person isn't read, and preferably, isn't even identified as a message. That's when you need to get lawyers involved. Sounds expensive. There's obviously something intrinsically valuable about such a service, because many people pay oh-so-very-much money for it.
Now let's imagine we're not talking about letters, we're talking about money. Would you address a $100 note through the mail to your child for their birthday? You'd pay for a stamp at least. Would you encase it in an envelope that you paid for at the local post-shop? Hmm... bill in the envelope. Anyone will be able to see that it is money. Perhaps encase it in a card? What if it is $1000? $10,000? $10 million? Does the protection service of an envelope somehow decrease because the value of the contents of the package increases? It's the opposite, isn't it? Bitcoin is both the cryptographically sealed envelope, and the network to deliver it.
It is my opinion that the intrinsic value of bitcoin is far far greater than anyone really comprehends. People generally are too focused on people just buying and selling the asset, but not about the cryptographic proof, and incentive structure that perpetuates the network functioning.  And when comparing the structure, and game theory that supports that structure, with any other alt or asset, there is no peer. 
What say you? Is an envelope intrinsically valuable?
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:49:56
You're the one who has an issue with it, not me.  Clearly bitcoin isn't for you.  
Time to sell. 
@_date: 2019-10-30 03:08:02
Are you saying that the only bitcoin you've ever bought was bought between the window of the 10th of december 2017, and the 8th of January 2018?  And you only bought at the height during that window, and not one of the times where it dropped to 13k during that time?  Because on February 1 2018, the price of bitcoin was under 9K.  And on March 1 of 2018, it was lower than todays price, and as noted above, hasn't been back to above that until four months ago.
If you had bought bitcoin at any time between March 1 2018 and June 16 2019, you would have increased in value.  You realize that, right?
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:38:07

Bitcoin block times are at 10 minutes.  They have always been at 10 minutes.  They aren't going to be changing from 10 minutes.


No, that's not what is stated there at all.  In effect, a user is likely to have more than one channel with multiple participants.


Oh yes.  And the fact that only the aggregated value of the transactions is committed to the blockchain.   Because of the network, and because the indvidual transactions are discarded when the chain is committed, there is effectively no way to determine how bitcoin got from point A to point B in the network short of recording each and every channel pair.

I actually have no idea when it will stop.  My theory is that most or all of the debt that is currently locked into fixed assets (like housing) is going to be subsumed by bitcoin.  Our financial system is trapped into a fixed asset debt inflation cycle.  Debt should be about offering liqudity and capital to businesses to expand production and/or services, not bidding up the price of a fixed asset.  Bitcoin is the reckoning for that system.

The scientist and professor in neuro-pyschology directly contradicts your statement. You know, she being one of the people who actually invents the tests for intelligence, and then undertake the tests, and then teaches doctors how to give those tests.
Yes. Let's ask the professor and scientist who is an actual expert in the construction and validation of iq tests shall we? She says : All of the studies that have shown those things you are parroting have ALL been shown to be as a result of bias in the testing methodology, and once you control for socioeconomic status and education, all variation disappears. The only way this is even discussed in science now is as an example of how to construct tests to remove bias. The iq tests that were used in the 60s are now only used as examples of how cultural and socio-economic bias in test creation needs to be considered in the construction of a test.

Not quite right.  Dashjr was instrumental in getting the blocksize increase in via a soft-fork.  He was one of many developers of segwit which was always a soft-fork. 
That's why it was such a compromise.  I agree with him.  If it had been up to me it would have been segwit without the blocksize increase.  But it had something for everyone.  The reality is though, as evidenced by the amount of people who have quickly adopted segwit, that most people don't care that much about txn fees.   The big adoption of segwit will happen with the progressive rollout of lightning and other 2nd layer solutions.

I don't like my government being able to place me under surveillance, so I remove their ability to.

PoS doesn't work for exactly that reason.  These large centralised businesses still can't come to grips with the fact that they can't control the governance.  They've been clearly telling their investors that they have more control over the system than they do, so that they can extract more money from the system when they get more control of it.   The only thing it tells me is that they are bleeding money, and their investors are starting to put the screws on them.

Because it increases the resource requirements of nodes, therefore forces nodes to cease functioning.  That is centralization because less people can validate the blockchain. 
Which has only been explained about ten thousand times.

Nope.  Lighting will be a countermeasure.  Transactions happen off chain.  You really won't care if your chain transaction takes a week.  All your money transfers will be instantaneous.  The more money you free up for lightning, the faster the velocity of the money, and the more value it will have.  I expect it to gain adoption very quickly.  Once the market actually decides to use bitcoin as a payment system.  Lightning allows that.

No proposal to decrease the limit has been accepted either, in spite of some very vocal core developers wanting it.  Which shows that core is not one person, but a group of people.

Hey, you know dude, what I think is going to be great about lightning is the OTC stuff.  I imagine the process of leveraging yourself into bitcoin will be the creation of a lightning wallet, and funding it through a channel created between you and your local bar, or your local grocery store.  It will be nothing more than an app.  You have a wallet, you put $50 or $100 on it.  With channel factories, the cost of that txn could be 5% of a normal chain transaction.  It's bitcoin.  You go to your local and buy a beer, hold up your phone to the device, and instantly paid.  When the funds are getting low, you go back and put $50 more on it.
Enough people doing this, and it won't matter where you're spending the $50.  You'll be able to top that $50 up at any place, and spend it anywhere.   More and more money gets leveraged into the system.  The value of that $50 channel becomes $100, or $200, over time.  It's bitcoin.  If you just wanna keep the channel open, do it.  It won't make any difference.  You will own bitcoin whether it is accessible in a lightning channel, or accessible in a bitcoin wallet.
It isn't gonna be a hard sell.
But you know what?  I still reckon that's five years away.  I just don't see the market for it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:55:23

I don't think you really understand the technology at all.  You're migrating from talking about it like it is just a payment system (it isn't) and then saying that X unit is too high, so people won't buy it, when in the previous paragraph that would have no relationship whatsoever to a payment system.
Transactions aren't too high.  They are exactly as high as people are willing to pay.  Competitors can't offer a better solution that provides a trustless anti-censorship method of value exchange.  If they had, people would be using them.
Bitcoin is decentralized and distributed.  No other crypto comes even close to the security that the nodes provide for bitcoin.  If you are actually curious of the technology, work out this first.  Because all that other stuff is completely immaterial to the technology.

@_date: 2017-11-23 23:06:36
That's the thing though.  In bitcoin, the technical level differentiation between understanding is the same parallel with something like the internet.  They'll never understand it, just like they'll never understand the underlying infrastructure of the internet.  
What they'll understand is that they have a bitcoin account, and only they have access to that bitcoin account.  If they lose the details to that account, they lose everything.  Just like those old spy movies with swiss bank accounts, and someone having to pass the code.  What they'll see is that their bitcoin account doesn't depreciate in value like their bank account does.  They don't need to understand why.  Enough people understanding this, and it doesn't matter why it's the case, even though the reason why is the amazing invention that it is.  Just like the internet.

@_date: 2017-11-23 01:36:14
Ah the ol no intrinsic value meme. I use [the 1:10000 rule]( for this argument.  It is my opinion that the intrinsic value of bitcoin is far far greater than anyone really comprehends.  People generally are too focused on people just buying and selling the asset, but not about the cryptographic proof, and incentive structure that perpetuates the network functioning.  So when people like to ask what the intrinsic value of bitcoin is, I say :
You are thinking of the store of value property without the cryptographic property that secures it. You are talking about it as one would talk about valuable shells, and even shell sellers, and not the security that separates it from all forms of value exchange before it. To understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin it is good to use the analogy of an envelope. So i ask you : does an envelope have intrinsic value?
If I have a letter that I need to send securely, would I prefer to send it open, and ready to be read? Or would I prefer for it to be sent within the confines of an envelope? Now let's think... would I prefer to just leave an open envelope, or would I think it necessary to put some seal across it to ensure that it isn't opened, and read whilst en-route. Does a sealable envelope have more intrinsic value than an unsealable one? Hmm... but what if someone can counterfeit the seal? I need some method of ensuring that the message I want to get to that person isn't read, and preferably, isn't even identified as a message. That's when you need to get lawyers involved. Sounds expensive. There's obviously something intrinsically valuable about such a service, because many people pay oh-so-very-much money for it.
Now let's imagine we're not talking about letters, we're talking about money. Would you address a $100 note through the mail to your child for their birthday? You'd pay for a stamp at least. Would you encase it in an envelope that you paid for at the local post-shop? Hmm... bill in the envelope.  Anyone will be able to see that it is money. Perhaps encase it in a card? What if it is $1000? $10,000? $10 million?  Does the protection service of an envelope somehow decrease because the value of the contents of the package increases? It's the opposite, isn't it? Bitcoin is both the cryptographically sealed envelope, and the network to deliver it.
What say you? Is an envelope intrinsically valuable?

More like ELI20.
Lightning allows users to take a single bitcoin transaction, and use it over a finite space of time, in order to shift bitcoin back and forth, with no or vanishingly small transaction fees, as iou's between what are called 'lightning channels'. The actual transaction size will be the same as a normal transaction, with a flag that says it can only be committed to the blockchain at a specific time (or block depth). In effect, these lightning transactions are cryptographically signed 'iou's. The 'thousands' of back-and-forth iou changes are discarded when the channel is closed (massive privacy dividend), and only the aggregated change is committed to the blockchain. This is the great thing about lightning. It is a single transaction with as many inputs and outputs (one/two) as defined in the original transaction. Only the transaction values change.
Consider a channel link of this : John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne. Only the people next to each other in the chain have a 'channel open' with each other (John/Bob, Bob/Sally, Sally/Anne). Assuming each of the channels between all of the participants have adequate funds in order to achieve this, if John wanted to send 1btc to Anne. A transaction ledger would read :
John-&gt;Bob channel : John -1btc, Bob +1btc
Bob-&gt;Sally channel : Bob -1btc, Sally +1btc
Sally-&gt;Anne channel : Sally -1btc, Anne +1btc.
Anne now has 1btc more, and John has 1btc less, but the net effect in each channel is simply a modification to the distribution of bitcoin in that channel.
Imagine this happening, back and forth, and extended to thousands, tens of thousands, and millions of people. As long as there's a chain between them, you use the chain. You might even have your transaction split over multiple chains. For links that don't have a chain, you create a channel on-the-fly.
Each channel, therefore, only ends up with the same single input, and the same two outputs, just differing values.
It's significantly more complex than that (transaction routing, and channel closure mechanics), but that's the idea. I wish I could remember the lightning dev that explained it. It really is very clever. I haven't actually questioned about the effect of having channels with multiple inputs (John/Sally) and outputs (Bob/Anne) at inception. Technically, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible. Just a much weirder set of ramifications.
I would suggest that the method for creating ln channels is most likely :  Carol wants to pay Bob 0.5btc.  She creates a ln channel with 1btc, of which Bob is allocated 0.5btc, and carol is allocated 0.5btc.  Bob gets paid 0.5btc that is accessible once confirmed.  Carol has 0.5btc that is now accessible once confirmed.  That way the ln can be bootstrapped by existing txns.
I'd also suggest that it would be easier to understand if Bob were Bob Inc.  The incentive will be for the buyer to reduce txn fees.  If Carol uses a store (coffee?) she will want to reduce paying those fees.   So she creates a channel with 0.1btc and 0.001 is allocated to Bob Inc. For the coffee she buys today, coffee + txn fee.  Ever more?  Zippo txn fee.   When your channel is almost zero, you buy bitcoin, it is delivered back to you by the rebalancing of that channel. And because it's Bob Inc the path through the channels from a source of bitcoin is reduced, maybe even two hops ( exchangeA/exchangeB -&gt; exchangeB/Bob Inc. -&gt; Bob Inc./Carol).

I never said it was.  I said that bitcions primary use case is as a decentralized store of value.  The fact that it is decentralized means that you can transfer value through the system, and exchange it for goods or services outside of the system without your transactions being censored.
But its primary purpose, as spelled out with the genesis block, is to use it as your bank.  Being your own bank is exactly what bitcoin is about.

If someone tries to cheat you, they have to close a channel with a fraudulent signature from you, and you will have to be on a week between that time and the time the channel closes.  You will then get all of the funds in the channel as they have cheated.  The game theory behind that means that it is unlikely that anyone will attempt it, because otherwise, they always lose.
How many people you reckon are going to commit to an attempted theft they always lose?  Hopefully they do that with me.  I'll enjoy keeping their bitcoin.

You can't copy the nodes, and it is the nodes that define the consensus rules, and it is the nodes that define its decentralization.  What do you think all this fork business is about?  They're copying the blockchain because they can't build their own node infrastructure.  So they actually give bitcoin holders tokens in their system for free just on the hope that they will use it.
There are sooooo many people who don't grasp this concept in bitcoin.  They're the ones that keep saying that bitcoin is like myspace.

The only way that bitcoin gets to its potential is by retaining its fundamental qualities of decentralization and censorship resistance as it adds functionality.  The only reason it has any value at all is because of those qualities. If you want to add to that functionality, good for you.  What you don't get to do is override those fundamental use cases. If your use cases aren't being met as a result of retaining the things that enabled it get to where it is, step off.

Very little.  No cryptos are even in the same ballpark with regard to node decentralization.  There are lots of pretenders that like to point at things that no-one is actually willing to use, but in the end, the only one that people are actually using as a store of value is bitcoin.

Unless you know what node your wallet is connecting to, it is just as exposed to third parties as any other third-party solution.  Unless you control the node that you make transactions on the blockchain with, the fact is, you have to trust someone.  If you run a node, you don't.  This is not to belittle Trezor, or any other hardware wallet, because short of running a node, they are one of the most secure systems.  But if you want to know for sure, you use a node for your transactions.

Bitcoin is infinitely divisible.  There are as many of these envelopes as there is money to pay for them.  They are, in effect, re-used.


But it's the only one that has the node decentralization of bitcoin, and network decentralization of bitcoin.  And that decentralization discrepancy between any other solution isn't getting smaller, it's getting larger.


Talk like that only demonstrates a lack of understanding of how consensus is applied in bitcoin.


It is actually.  Every other solution requires more trust than bitcoin, and that discrepancy is getting greater and greater.  It is the only secure at-scale implementation of the game theory solution to the byzantine generals problem.  It is that final quality that makes bitcoin a once-in-a-thousand-year invention.

 Complete bullshit.   I'm investing in the technology.  Investment requires an understanding of the asset you are acquiring, whether that is for dividends, or as a venture capitalist to invest in the seed round of a start-up so that you can sell your stock in the product for an increased price at some later date, or an asset you acquiring because you expect it to increase in value at a later date for justifiable reasons.  
Just so you know, this isn't my particular bent.  This is what I've gotten [from Warren Buffet](  When he invested in banks during the 2007 financial crisis, it wasn't because he was expecting dividends.  He was expecting to buy low and sell high.  And you don't get a bigger value investor than Warren Buffet.
All this is a bit of a muchness though.  If you don't want to invest in bitcoin don't.  I'm a big believer in making sure you don't invest in things you don't understand.  For me, it's stupid not to act on things that I know that, as it turns out, I've been pretty well spot-on in. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:22:49
This thread seems to be an entire talk-fest about why this thing that is working as designed can't work. 
What bitcoin is doing is providing a method of stepping out of the existing inflation based currency model, into a model that can't be captured, and protects your savings.  People are looking at it like it is a stock, and conflating stock behavior with bitcoin desirability. But it is not a stock.  It is pure money.  What it is doing is deflating the actual bubble, and that is debt, and specifically consumer debt.  The consumer debt bubble is in the multi trillions, and it is not going to stop.
If you don't understand the value proposition, there is no use investing in it. It is always a good idea to understand the value proposition of any investment, otherwise it is just gambling. There are lots of gamblers in bitcoin, but why wouldn't there be?
I, however, am not a gambler. I understand bitcoin for what it is : A disruptive technology in banking, finance, and currency. It is going to do to consumer banking what the internet did to magazine publishing. Ultimately, this is a disruptive technology in the things even above banking, finance and currency. It is a disruptive technology in the identification, classification, and distribution of value.
The identification of value is at the core of all monetary interactions between people. What one person values, another person does not. Bitcoin is transforming that interaction.

@_date: 2017-11-06 01:54:16
I go further.  The virus spreads to the loan suppliers of fixed assets.  "we'll give you money for that house" they say, and then you pay back 3x the original price to service the debt.  But if I save in my deflationary currency, the more the prices get bid up, the higher the value of my deflationary asset goes.
Said it [here]( but it applies just as much to this argument.  I think people preferring bitcoin for savings is unavoidable.  I also don't think it is going to be resisted quite as much as people think it will be.  People still need to pay their taxes, and that is not going to stop.  The main thing it is going to do is prick the bubble of consumer debt, and remove the banking middle-men from that space.  That alone is a multi-trillion dollar industry, let alone the annuities that banks own and graft from, from those assets.  Removing these people (i.e. banking debt suppliers) from positions of power, by strangling their access to capital, is a justification for bitcoin in its own right.  Imagine a world in which banks didn't control governments.  
Mostly I think bitcoin will finally separate the good debt from the bad debt. It is my personal belief ( as in i don't know of any formal theory ) that debt should only be incurred for the use of building a productive asset. In a deflationary currency, this encourages businesses to ensure that productivity increases will have greater returns than savings. Instead, our financial system has encouraged the acquisition of debt for fixed assets. The only thing this has done us bid up the price of those fixed debts with debt, and handed over the money for supporting that system to banks and their owners. In order to stimulate growth in such a system, the only way that you can function is to tax savings. That's what inflation is.  What it forces people to do is to invest in increasingly risky assets, because of the loss of their purchasing power.  Hence bubble after bubble after bubble.  Crisis after crisis after crisis.
Bitcoin will eventually stabilize to an ever appreciating value asset. But what it will allow you to do is save for a house. If you have a business proposal that encourages people to pay you for a good or service, people will invest their savings in it and take on that risk.  Banks will instead move back to providing capital to businesses, using savings from people that are willing to invest.  Businesses will again focus on productivity increases, because that's how you get access to capital.
That's the way it is supposed to work i think.  Bitcoin is an antibody vs the parasites of non-productive debt-based instruments.  It is pure genius.

No.  Transactions on the blockchain will never be free.  I'm not sure bitcoin is for you if you like free stuff.  Money isn't really about people with stuff giving other people free stuff for no reason.


If there is an incentive to close a channel, it will be closed.  If there is no incentive, it won't.  The great thing about lightning is that you don't really ever need to close a channel.


There is no such thing.  There are channels, and there are channels, and there are channels.  Like I said, you clearly don't actually have any comprehension of how it works.  You need to turn off that rbtc tap.  It fucks with your brain.

But the topic is btc1, which is a change, and that change will have effects.  You don't think that the effects of that change should be investigated before it is implemented?  Don't you recognize that that is the type of thing that a specification should detail?


But we're not off on a tangent, because they don't have an open development process.  If they did, they would be developing a specification before they even started on such a fundamental change, and then they would open that specification to discussion, and work out a plan to validate it.
And that would take time, but what you'd find is that core developers would actually assist in the process, because that's an open development process.


Two weeks before it activates?  Jeez man... I mean seriously.  There isn't even a plan for testing.  There never was.  And two weeks before it activates, we should just close our eyes and hope for the best?

Not just sending money.  Securing money.  I used the example for a reason.   Now imagine you're holding a totally secure safe with 100 million dollars in it.


But you can't get people to run it.  You can't get people to accept your new thing.  You can't get people to put their money into it.  That's how bitcoin remains secure.  People running full nodes and validating the blockchain themselves for their own transactions.

I'm trying to get you to understand the concept of nodes and consensus, because you clearly do not understand how consensus works in bitcoin.  BCH doesn't have decentralization, so the entire term 'consensus' doesn't even exist.
It isn't number of nodes, it is *nodes that are used to create/receive transactions*.  They got squat, and it's no real secret.  Because no-one really gives a shit.  It is just a big pump and dump.  The only people who are using nodes are probably the people running the pump and dump, and the occasional exchange.

I desperately want the miners to attack the SHA-256 chain.  The PoW change has already been written.  It was written for the UASF.   That was the threat the last time that made the miners fold.  The only question then was whether the nodes would change.  But if the miners are attacking the SHA-256 chain?  Your choices are :
1. Upgrade your node to 0.16 with new PoW
2. Uninstall your node, and ever use bitcoin again.
3. Downgrade your node to the 2x node client, accept that they will increase the blocksize until you can't run a node anymore, and then complete with option 2.
There is really only one choice.  Upgrade your node, and continue on your merry way, or cease validating the blockchain.  It won't even be a difficult choice.  I'm hoping that they do attack the SHA-256 chain so that this can be realized.

It has nothing to do with benefit.  Miners who do it forego money.  it is game theory.  The miners that earn more money will be selfishly able to support themselves longer in the business of mining because they earn more money.

Let's keep it on the subject of reality.  Mining costs money.  Nodes cost money to run.  There will always be transaction fees, and there will always be a fee market.  You want to have your transactions committed to the blockchain, you pay the fee for that transaction.  Lightning will even alleviate that issue.


If all of the miners stop mining (which is in itself a laughable premise) there will be a new node  client with an alternate PoW.  Install that client, and new miners will mine for you.  They do this because they are paid in bitcoin.
New miners think happy days, old miners wonder what they're going to do with their loud expensive energy-draining hot paper-weights.

Alts swim in the ocean that  was built for bitcoin.  There are copies, but they are all poor copies simply hoping that they have the right to swim in  bitcoins wake.  The only other differentiated coin, ethereum, failed at the first hurdle.  They sacrificed immutability in order to bail out investors in a contract that defines its difference with bitcoin.

Nope.  40-50
Personally, I'd say if you're paying more than 20 sats for chain commits you're paying too much.  Bitcoin isn't about fast confirmation times, it's about finality of confirmations.  Any 20 sat transaction from two weeks ago has already been committed.  As usual, you'll be able to say the same thing in two weeks.  I'm pretty sure I've never paid more than 50 sats/byte.  I've never even once had a transaction not go through.

Ah the ol no intrinsic value meme. I use [the 1:10000 rule]( for this argument.  It is my opinion that the intrinsic value of bitcoin is far far greater than anyone really comprehends.  People generally are too focused on people just buying and selling the asset, but not about the cryptographic proof, and incentive structure that perpetuates the network functioning.  So when people like to ask what the intrinsic value of bitcoin is, I say :
You are thinking of the store of value property without the cryptographic property that secures it. You are talking about it as one would talk about valuable shells, and even shell sellers, and not the security that separates it from all forms of value exchange before it. To understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin it is good to use the analogy of an envelope. So i ask you : does an envelope have intrinsic value?
If I have a letter that I need to send securely, would I prefer to send it open, and ready to be read? Or would I prefer for it to be sent within the confines of an envelope? Now let's think... would I prefer to just leave an open envelope, or would I think it necessary to put some seal across it to ensure that it isn't opened, and read whilst en-route. Does a sealable envelope have more intrinsic value than an unsealable one? Hmm... but what if someone can counterfeit the seal? I need some method of ensuring that the message I want to get to that person isn't read, and preferably, isn't even identified as a message. That's when you need to get lawyers involved. Sounds expensive. There's obviously something intrinsically valuable about such a service, because many people pay oh-so-very-much money for it.
Now let's imagine we're not talking about letters, we're talking about money. Would you address a $100 note through the mail to your child for their birthday? You'd pay for a stamp at least. Would you encase it in an envelope that you paid for at the local post-shop? Hmm... bill in the envelope.  Anyone will be able to see that it is money. Perhaps encase it in a card? What if it is $1000? $10,000? $10 million?  Does the protection service of an envelope somehow decrease because the value of the contents of the package increases? It's the opposite, isn't it? Bitcoin is both the cryptographically sealed envelope, and the network to deliver it.
What say you? Is an envelope intrinsically valuable?

@_date: 2017-11-27 13:44:04
Don't agree.  I think bitcoin is broken up into three different groups.  Holders, Users, and Miners.  Miners are paid.  Users pay the miners to record transactions, and holders provide the capital for the system.  The node owners are the users.  They are also the developers.  Users adopt developer software, and that is how you get consensus changes.
This dynamic is what I thinks is the solution to [the byzantine generals problem.](  Hashing and consensus ensure that any player in this system can be replaced if they attack the system, with no real damage to the system.  Only the attacker loses.

Yep.  But it doesn't really change anything.  Bitcoin is being acquired because of word-of-mouth more than any other thing I reckon.  It's money.  Of course it will draw a certain element.   I think it demonstrates that that element isn't particularly sophisticated, at least for now.

Miners vote on nothing.  They either follow the consensus rules of bitcoin, which is policed by the nodes, or they don't get paid in bitcoin.  Which is why the miners have done exactly as they are told. 


Bitcoin is not just money. If that is all you think it is, i would understand your confusion. Bitcoin is money, and the cryptographically secure network to deliver it. Once you get your head around that, you might see it in a different light.

It was a pretty meh question and a pretty dumb answer TBH.
The answer is that the UTXO is a database of all unspent coins that have been validated *up to now*.  So that validation has already occurred for any amount of money that someone is spending.  A user adds a transaction to a node, to see whether the person making that transaction is authorized to do so (i.e. validation) and if it is valid, it is added to their mempool.  From there, a miner may include it in a block.  Once it has been included in a block, the node then validates that the block meets consensus rules, and if so the UTXO is updated with the new amounts that everyone is entitled to own.

Not quite double.  A hard-forked coin of bitcoin that doesn't have consensus will always be worth less money.  The problem is, a hard-fork can decide to implement themselves maliciously, so that they can steal peoples coins on the non-hard-forked chain.  That's what 2x is, a malicious hard-fork.
So the coins will be worth less.  What this tool purports to do, is to remove the threat of a malicious fork, so that you can safely dispose of the malicious chain coins.  What you do with that dividend is up to you.  Some people spend it, some people buy more bitcoin.
It will be great to have this as a permanent utility if it can deliver on its premise.
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:08:27

I think a lot of people are looking for justifications for why they didn't invest in something, so they use made-up stats in order to explain away their inability to identify something that is a good investment.
Bitcoin was a good investment at $100, at $400, at $1000, at $5000 and at $10,000.  The only thing that has changed is that more people know it now.

Security.  Only by running a full node do you know for certain when you send or receive bitcoin.  I love electrum, the light wallet, but you are trusting that they are running a bitcoin node so that your transactions are actually in bitcoin.  There are other node variants like SPV wallets ( like breadwallet ) that can be gamed by miners and exchanges such that you can lose all of your bitcoin. 
You run a bitcoin node so you know you have bitcoin.

Lightning is an onion routed distributed system.  It is as centralised as torrenting.  Why?  Because it is the same technology.   except it also includes onion routing which makes it even more secure, more decentralized, and every node is an exit point for a channel opening or closure.  The only difference is that lightning is sharing tiny little files with cryptographic proofs.  It is even more decentralized than bitcoin, because you can transact with anyone without even communicating through a node.  You think torrenting is centralized?  You think TOR is centralized?

The nodes define consensus in bitcoin, not miners.  Miners are paid to hash blocks.  They do the work.  Nodes do the proof to make sure they did the work.  They are paid for their work.  If they don't want to do that work, they don't get paid.

@_date: 2017-11-11 01:21:49

They will if they reach a margin call. 
Bitcoin isn't like standard commodities.  The commodities themselves are in regulated markets.  Bitcoin is not.  Anyone can immediately buy as much money as they have of bitcoin.  Try doing that with pork bellies. 
There is no futures market with the liquidity of bitcoin.   Shorts will get crushed.  Maybe when bitcoin is a 10 trillion market we might see a stabilization.   Until then, the only thing this is going to do is force institutional investors that want to invest in bitcoin futures, to buy actual bitcoin as a hedge.  Which, yet again, in a market with high liquidity and tight supply, will crush any shorts. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:03:40

Nope.  I don't see it stabilizing until bitcoin formally  deflates the fixed asset debt bubble.  When a house is back to 4x-7x a single persons median income.  Until that time, more debt is being pumped into the system bidding up prices, so bitcoin will keep increasing in value.

With no node decentralization it is trivial for a state actor to monitor all communications between nodes and exchanges such that they would be able to determine where any exchanges were occurring, and for how much.  As far as I'm aware, there are under 1000.  I would suggest that 99% of traffic using monero is occurring as exchanges between monero wallets on exchanges.  And there just aren't that many transactions.  
Is it better than bitcoin?  No doubt, at least as an obfuscation.  But it isn't providing the security that most people think it is.  And most people aren't even taking the simplest of precautionary measures of actually running their monero node, and washing their transactions through multiple (and varying size) transactions.

Posted this [here]( but this is as good a place as any to repost
It has actually taken me years to really absorb the ramifications of this technology, let alone understand it, and there is no question that there is so much more to get. It is pure genius.
I have my own interpretation of the bitcoin invention, that I think reflects my understanding. Maybe I'm just talking shit, but I reckon it's at least a little bit internally consistent. I'm building on it, because it helps clarify it for me.
This is actually a game theory problem. There are three groups in bitcoin. The users, the holders, and the miners. To understand the way that relationship works, you have to understand what keeps everyone separated and honest. That requires an understanding of the incentives of bitcoin, and that requires understanding what [proof-of-work]( is.
Proof-of-work aligns consensus with the users, because it is the users that are paying the miners. Even holders require users, and more importantly, node owners. Therefore, it is users that are incentivizing the miners. [Proof-of-stake]( aligns consensus with the holders, who are paying the miners. That is an incentive structure that reflects our current financial system. But bitcoin changes this through incentive structures and cryptography. In bitcoin, it is the incentive of the payers, not the paid, that imo is the wild invention of satoshi, and enacted through cryptography.
PoS fails because there is only one outcome given that incentive structure. Holders being miners, and then controlling the users. PoW overcomes this because the outcome is the constant tension between all three.
At the heart of the solution is the byzantine generals problem. The problem is "if you are a number of generals surrounding a castle, how do you give the attack date and ensure that the message to attack is correctly received, when you know that the message may be altered along the way?". There's game theory around what is possible, but that's the gist of it. I have reduced it to three. Given you know one is a traitor, how do you deliver the message to attack?
The way that this is managed is that miners order the transactions, and race to hash them to an algorithm (the work in proof-of-work), which is in bitcoin, SHA-256, until they get an answer that they will be accepted by the nodes (proof). They are incentivized to become more and more efficient, and spend more resources as the price increases. The nodes provide the proof in proof-of-work. For that work, the nodes award miners bitcoin. The nodes can prove which miner spent more work, but it sometimes takes a few blocks to get it right, which is why you have to wait for a few confirmations.
The only real thing that miners can threaten to do is stop users (the people paying them) from receiving blocks. Users and holders, after all, control their own cryptographic proofs to the tokens. But the current miners are only miners of SHA-256 pow algorithm blocks. In an adversarial condition, the miners will have just stopped coming to the party, so the users say 'fuck this' and change the pow. They get a new set of miners, mining a new algorithm, and the holders go 'holy shit, do I wanna spend my cash with a bunch of numpties that couldn't behave themselves?'. And they start spending their cash on the chain that the users say is the real one, and everyone just goes about their business again. Old miners get crushed. New miners think happy days. If the nodes change their software, that's the end of the story. Because the nodes define the consensus, they can. The remaining node owners get to decide whether they want to be owned by the miners, or whether they actually want to still remain users. The holders decide whether they are more likely to be able to realize their money with the miners that now control a drastically centralized subset of nodes, or to continue on in the system that led to their being holders in the first place.
Users can't attack the system, because then they would become holders, and users would no longer trust them for the reasons already stated, and they don't hold the cryptographic proofs of the holders. If the holders do that, they lose all of their users, so the only thing they game-theory-wise would do, would be to instate a pow. Why would anyone prefer a system in which the people with the money have all of the power? Otherwise known as the world financial system.
Whoever attacks loses, and there's no real way to cheat the system. That's the brilliant solution to the byzantine generals problem. It is a self-sustaining financial system that rewards everyone for participating in it, where incentives are perfectly aligned for its longevity, with an ever reducing supply of tokens that are effectively infinitely divisible, increasing their value per-capita. And no, there isn't any other system in the world that shares these properties.

I think bitcoin will finally separate the good debt from the bad debt. It is my personal belief ( as in i don't know of any formal theory ) that debt should only be incurred for the use of building a productive asset. In a deflationary currency, this encourages businesses to ensure that productivity increases will have greater returns than savings. Instead, our financial system has encouraged the acquisition of debt for fixed assets. The only thing this has done us bid up the price of those fixed debts with debt, and handed over the money for supporting that system to banks. In order to stimulate growth in such a system, the only way that you can function is to tax savings. That's what inflation is.
Bitcoin will eventually stabilize to an ever appreciating value asset. But what it will allow you to do is save for a house. If you have a business proposal that encourages people to pay you for a good or service, people will invest their savings in it and take on that risk.
That's the way it is supposed to work i think.

Bingo.  Perfect.  So I'll talk about what means.  For the record, I use [the 1:10000 rule]( for this type of argument.  I have written parts and bits of this before.  I chop and change as required.
Because bitcoin has such decentralization of nodes, it enables the implementation of the invention of Satoshi Nakamoto.  Before this invention, there was no way, game-theory-wise, that a system could be constructed such that trustlessness could be maintained, and therefore, any store of value became dependent upon some structure that had to be relied upon for validation.  Only at the beginning, before the decentralization, was it possible to shut the system down.  
This is the game theory problem : There are three groups in bitcoin. The users, the holders, and the miners. To understand the way that relationship works, you have to understand what keeps everyone separated and honest. That requires an understanding of the incentives of bitcoin, and that requires understanding what [proof-of-work]( is.

I think that energy is simply a function right now of rapidly increasing price.   When bitcoin stabilizes, the profit motive for large capital expenditure ( and therefore energy use ) will reduce.  That, in my opinion, is where the speculation is.   I expect most chip manufacturers and miners to eventually bleed money until an equilibrium is found.  That, however, won't happen until an equilibrium in bitcoins price is found.  I don't expect that for a decade.
As for alternatives, it boils down to what bitcoin is, and how it achieves its decentralization.  Because THAT is the stuff of pure genius.  And I'm not talking "oh he's a smart guy 'n all" I'm talking about one of the greatest inventions of all time.  So I have another [1:10000 rule]( argument for that one.

Plenty of miners willing to do the job if they don't wanna.  You want bitcoin, you mine to bitcoin consensus rules that the nodes enforce.

That's the thing.  Facts don't work with numpties.  Their desire isn't to raise themselves to your level, their desire is to lower you to theirs.  Shut them down.  You don't need to have a reason.  If that makes you feel disaffected, I don't care.  Don't be a numpty, and you won't have the numpty-hammer applied.


Be better by being better.  By having better discourse, not by being more welcoming to numpties.  If you can't maintain a discourse without being a numpty, then spend time with a lower discourse with the other numpty-folk.  I don't care about being a better person as a single point of interest, I care about having a supportable argument, and applying critical thinking, which makes me rational, which makes me a better person.
There are plenty of people who should have the banhammer applied instantly and permanently by spreading lies to the newer users.  You can't argue conspiracy theories with numpties.  They're numpties.  Logic doesn't apply.  The only thing that works is moderation and ridicule.

I think bitcoin will finally separate the good debt from the bad debt.  It is my personal belief ( as in i don't know of any formal theory ) that debt should only be incurred for the use of building a productive asset.  In a deflationary currency, this encourages businesses to ensure that productivity increases will have greater returns than savings.  Instead, our financial system has encouraged the acquisition of debt for fixed assets.  The only thing this has done us bid up the price of those fixed debts with debt, and handed over the money for supporting that system to banks. In order to stimulate growth in such a system, the only way that you can function is to tax savings.  That's what inflation is. 
Bitcoin will eventually stabilize to an ever appreciating value asset.  But what it will allow you to do is save for a house.  If you have a business proposal that encourages people to pay you for a good or service, people will invest their savings in it and take on that risk. 
That's the way it is supposed to work i think.

?  About that part you're right?  I'm pretty sure they do.  It's just that is a specific time-locked transaction, and its final details for the ratio of the committed funds to the blockchain isn't determined until a later date.  What I'm saying is, it's not nearly as big a deal as some make out, as there is already a way that those channel creations can be 'batched', and not only that, they can be re-balanced.
I see 20 customers of a coffee shop having their channels batched into a single chain commit.  It is like a decentralized distributed deployment.  It is absolutely fkn wild.  And each of those channels are just normal lightning channels, so they can be linked like every other lightning channel.  Not only that, you're not forced to do it this way.  You can choose any method you like.
Lightning is going to change the world, on the backbone of bitcoin.  To bet against it, in my opinion, is pure folly.

I think it is unavoidable.  I also don't think it is going to be resisted quite as much as people think it will be.  People still need to pay their taxes, and that is not going to stop.  The main thing it is going to do is prick the bubble of consumer debt, and remove the banking middle-men from that space.  That alone is a multi-trillion dollar industry, let alone the annuities that banks own and graft from, from those assets.  Removing these people (i.e. banking debt suppliers) from positions of power, by strangling their access to capital, is a justification for bitcoin in its own right.  Imagine a world in which banks didn't control governments.  
Said [here]( mostly I think bitcoin will finally separate the good debt from the bad debt. It is my personal belief ( as in i don't know of any formal theory ) that debt should only be incurred for the use of building a productive asset. In a deflationary currency, this encourages businesses to ensure that productivity increases will have greater returns than savings. Instead, our financial system has encouraged the acquisition of debt for fixed assets. The only thing this has done is bid up the price of those fixed debts with debt, and handed over the money for supporting that system to banks and their owners. In order to stimulate growth in such a system, the only way that you can function is to tax savings. That's what inflation is.  What it forces people to do is to invest in increasingly risky assets, because of the loss of their purchasing power.  Hence bubble after bubble after bubble.  Crisis after crisis after crisis.
Bitcoin will eventually stabilize to an ever appreciating value asset. But what it will allow you to do is save for a house. If you have a business proposal that encourages people to pay you for a good or service, people will invest their savings in it and take on that risk.  Banks will instead move back to providing capital to businesses, using savings from people that are willing to invest.  Businesses will again focus on productivity increases, because that's how you get access to capital.
That's the way it is supposed to work i think.  Like I said, it is pure genius.

Because they don't?  They are not full nodes.  It is nodes that are peers in bitcoin.   Because only a full node can be used to validate blocks and transactions on the blockchain.  Spv nodes don't validate blocks. 
 That's what peer means.   Every peer needs to validate. That's what makes you a peer. Want to trust people to interact? Then you are not a peer. You are not equal. You need to control a node to interact. Only by controlling a node can you use bitcoin trustlessly. Only by controlling a node are you a peer.

You mean like segwit was never going to activate, because miners were never going to activate, until suddenly, you know, they fell into line, and did?


Node users are against change.  Which is why soft-forks are encouraged, and hard-forks are discouraged.  Because on soft-forks, they don't actually need to change.  But given the choice between an SHA-256 chain that is being attacked, and therefore no transactions, and a new PoW that establishes miner decentralization again, allows transactions, and crushes the miners forcing the change to boot, there really isn't much of a reason not to change.
I desperately want the miners to attack the SHA-256 chain.  The PoW change has already been written.  It was written for the UASF.   That was the threat the last time that made the miners fold.  The only question then was whether the nodes would change.  But if the miners are attacking the SHA-256 chain?  Your choices are :
1. Upgrade your node to 0.16 with new PoW
2. Uninstall your node, and ever use bitcoin again.
3. Downgrade your node to the 2x node client, accept that they will increase the blocksize until you can't run a node anymore, and then complete with option 2.
There is really only one choice.  Upgrade your node, and continue on your merry way, or cease validating the blockchain.  It won't even be a difficult choice.  I'm hoping that they do attack the SHA-256 chain so that this can be realized.

Incorrect.  It is even more decentralised.  You don't really understand how lightning works, do you?
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:45:57
Right.  So you don't understand how lightning works.  And that's ok.  It's a complex subject. 
Lightning allows users to take a single bitcoin transaction, and use it over a finite space of time, in order to shift bitcoin back and forth, with no or vanishingly small transaction fees, as iou's between what are called 'lightning channels'. The actual transaction size will be the same as a normal transaction, with a flag that says it can only be committed to the blockchain at a specific time (or block depth). In effect, these lightning transactions are cryptographically signed 'iou's. The 'thousands' of back-and-forth iou changes are discarded when the channel is closed (massive privacy dividend), and only the aggregated change is committed to the blockchain. This is the great thing about lightning. It is a single transaction with as many inputs and outputs (one/two) as defined in the original transaction. Only the transaction values change.
Consider a channel link of this : John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne. Only the people next to each other in the chain have a 'channel open' with each other (John/Bob, Bob/Sally, Sally/Anne). Assuming each of the channels between all of the participants have adequate funds in order to achieve this, if John wanted to send 1btc to Anne. A transaction ledger would read :
John-&gt;Bob channel : John -1btc, Bob +1btc
Bob-&gt;Sally channel : Bob -1btc, Sally +1btc
Sally-&gt;Anne channel : Sally -1btc, Anne +1btc.
Anne now has 1btc more, and John has 1btc less, but the net effect in each channel is simply a modification to the distribution of bitcoin in that channel.
Imagine this happening, back and forth, and extended to thousands, tens of thousands, and millions of people. As long as there's a chain between them, you use the chain. You might even have your transaction split over multiple chains. For links that don't have a chain, you create a channel on-the-fly.
Each channel, therefore, only ends up with the same single input, and the same two outputs, just differing values.
It's significantly more complex than that (transaction routing, and channel closure mechanics), but that's the idea. I wish I could remember the lightning dev that explained it. It really is very clever. I haven't actually questioned about the effect of having channels with multiple inputs (John/Sally) and outputs (Bob/Anne) at inception. Technically, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible. Just a much weirder set of ramifications.
I would suggest that the method for creating ln channels is most likely : Carol wants to pay Bob 0.5btc. She creates a ln channel with 1btc, of which Bob is allocated 0.5btc, and carol is allocated 0.5btc. Bob gets paid 0.5btc that is accessible once confirmed. Carol has 0.5btc that is now accessible once confirmed. That way the ln can be bootstrapped by existing txns.
I'd also suggest that it would be easier to understand if Bob were Bob Inc. The incentive will be for the buyer to reduce txn fees. If Carol uses a store (coffee?) she will want to reduce paying those fees. So she creates a channel with 0.1btc and 0.001 is allocated to Bob Inc. For the coffee she buys today, coffee + txn fee. Ever more? Zippo txn fee. When your channel is almost zero, you buy bitcoin, it is delivered back to you by the rebalancing of that channel. And because it's Bob Inc the path through the channels from a source of bitcoin is reduced, maybe even two hops ( exchangeA/exchangeB -&gt; exchangeB/Bob Inc. -&gt; Bob Inc./Carol). 
So where is this centralization you are talking of occurring?

[Five Eyes]( countries share intelligence, and they aren't shy about doing it.  The last prime minister of NZ looks like there's a case to answer where their foreign spy service was used for domestic intelligence at the behest of the american FBI in the kim dotcom asset seizure.  If NZ is doing it, everyone is.  The CIA uses the UK to spy on americans.  That's how they get away with it.
It won't really protect you if you are that particular type of asshole that it makes people want to circumvent these procedures, but it's definitely going to protect you from blanket government surveillance.

I'd suggest that it would be easier to understand if Bob were Bob Inc. The incentive will be for the buyer to reduce txn fees. If Carol uses a store (coffee?) she will want to reduce paying those fees. So she creates a channel with 0.1btc and 0.001 is allocated to Bob Inc. For the coffee she buys today, coffee + txn fee.

Completely agree.  I  also started on Usenet forums back in the 80s.  It is why i have the attitude i have.  I have seen many communities die because they didnt defend themselves against the lowest common denominators.   So i say : Shout the stupid motherfuckers down.  Don't ever let them direct the narrative.  Escalate it until they quit.  Redirect them away from the conversation. 
The thing to really understand is that they're not that smart.  If they were smart, they would not act as they do. You can't reason with them, but you need an arsenal of methods to shut them down.  Ridicule is best.  They know enough that people laughing at them hurts their egos.  
Personally i think there should be a moderation rule : don't be a numpty.   Moderators give 10 day suspensions for being numpties.   Have it demonstrated that you're saying something that is untrue but you keep saying it?  Numpty.  10 days.  No warning.  Maxwell is actually arranging bot farms to downvote bitcoin comments?  Numpty.  30 days.   No warning.  Keep a list of all the people who have gotten bans for being numpties.  Laugh at them.

?  Of course it is.  If wages aren't increasing, but inflation is, which is set by central banks, it means that people are going backwards.  How is this caused?  Because of the implosion of value of fixed assets a la the housing crisis.  In order to get the economy working in that scenario, the only way you can 'stimulate growth' is to decrease the cost of debt and/or print money, which forces people to spend their depreciating wealth.  Which is exactly what happened.


In truth, of course, there is no true 'capitalist system'.  All western democracies practice socialism to various levels.  Some more effectively than others.

Outstanding.  
For the people who don't know what this is, this allows you to run a node, and also an electrum server so you can point your electrum wallet to your own node.  Electrum even has an android implementation, so even on your phone you could be using your own node for your own bitcoin transactions.   You want privacy?  You got privacy.
Electrum also allows you to sign transactions on an air-gapped computer.  So you can access your crypto in cold storage without ever connecting it to the internet.  This is the gold standard in security.

Ah the ol no intrinsic value meme. I use [the 1:10000 rule]( for this argument.  It is my opinion that the intrinsic value of bitcoin is far far greater than anyone really comprehends.  People generally are too focused on people just buying and selling the asset, but not about the cryptographic proof, and incentive structure that perpetuates the network functioning.  So when people like to ask what the intrinsic value of bitcoin is, I say :
You are thinking of the store of value property without the cryptographic property that secures it. You are talking about it as one would talk about valuable shells, and even shell sellers, and not the security that separates it from all forms of value exchange before it. To understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin it is good to use the analogy of an envelope. So i ask you : does an envelope have intrinsic value?
If I have a letter that I need to send securely, would I prefer to send it open, and ready to be read? Or would I prefer for it to be sent within the confines of an envelope? Now let's think... would I prefer to just leave an open envelope, or would I think it necessary to put some seal across it to ensure that it isn't opened, and read whilst en-route. Does a sealable envelope have more intrinsic value than an unsealable one? Hmm... but what if someone can counterfeit the seal? I need some method of ensuring that the message I want to get to that person isn't read, and preferably, isn't even identified as a message. That's when you need to get lawyers involved. Sounds expensive. There's obviously something intrinsically valuable about such a service, because many people pay oh-so-very-much money for it.
Now let's imagine we're not talking about letters, we're talking about money. Would you address a $100 note through the mail to your child for their birthday? You'd pay for a stamp at least. Would you encase it in an envelope that you paid for at the local post-shop? Hmm... bill in the envelope.  Anyone will be able to see that it is money. Perhaps encase it in a card? What if it is $1000? $10,000? $10 million?  Does the protection service of an envelope somehow decrease because the value of the contents of the package increases? It's the opposite, isn't it? Bitcoin is both the cryptographically sealed envelope, and the network to deliver it.
What say you? Is an envelope intrinsically valuable?

This entire discussion on transaction cost is a red-herring.  Bitcoin users overwhelmingly *do not care* about transaction costs.  The ones that do reduce their transaction costs by adopting segwit transactions.  My evidence : The price of bitcoin, and the price people are willing to pay to use it.
No one is forcing you to use bitcoin.  Don't.  Leave.  Go away.  Don't come back.  How many times does this have to be explained so that you get the message?  Your consensus changes are not wanted.

The statistical rate of inflation isn't actually the rate of inflation.  It has long been my contention that the statistical rate of inflation is not reflected in reality, and is simply used as a method of governments hiding the cost of inflationary policy.  It's not even difficult to understand.  You are admitting point blank that prices go up more than inflation.  Ergo, inflation statistics don't reflect actual inflation.




But that's it dude.  It's that key point that you're glossing over.  Your argument is "it goes up because of inflation, and inflation goes up because it goes up."  It's a circle.  The only thing you've got is a desire to reference your belief structure against an inflating framework.  Take away that framework, and the justification for increasing prices goes away.  
Unless, as I stated, you're actually delivering a better good or service than what already exists.  Then, you get a price increase over existing goods or services, because those have an increased value than the predecessor.  And that is an increase in productivity.


Stop with your tangents dude.

Bitcoin has decentralized nodes.  BCH does not.  Which is why BCH can fork whenever they want, and bitcoin cannot.  Because the nodes have to accept a consensus change.  Because no-one gives a shit about BCH, no-one gives a shit about the consensus rules changing.

You know what dude, in spite of what it may seem, i actually hope ethereum figures this shit out.  But these are big big problems.  The first real big problem that they had they fluffed.  The dao debacle.  Now we have the new parity thing, and the precedent was set.  It is now totally arbitrary.  It's a problem. 
But the much bigger problem is the blockchain size.  Ethereum nodes are failing, slowly and as expected.  The syncing problem has to be solved.  Pos this, shard that.  This is a problem that has been known about since its design.  I haven't seen anything that even looks like a solution. 
I reckon they are gonna be forced to hard-fork to an agreed block depth.   This permanently destroys the immutability use case.  But is it important?  Not sure.  I mean seriously, i am not.  But it stops it being a store of value.  It might be very good at only a transactional medium.  But that doesn't make the units valuable for holding.

Y'all need to learn how bitcoin works.  Nodes define and police consensus in bitcoin, not miners.  What the nodes say is bitcoin, is bitcoin.  In order for bitcoin to not be bitcoin anymore, the bitcoin node users need to replace their nodes with something else.  They (as in we) ain't gonna be uninstalling our nodes, and installing a malicious buggy node client written by one guy. 
You want to protect your bitcoin?  Run a node.  Use your node. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:27:05


No they are not.  Nodes approve valid blocks to be appended to the blockchain.  If you don't meet the consensus rules of blocks, you ain't extending shit.  Nodes are the proof in  proof-of-work. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:36:30


Stop ya right there.  No.  It isn't.  Everyone should run a node.  Anything that decreases decentralization is bad.  The only reason why segwit, a blocksize increase, was acceptable whatsoever was because of the malleability fix. 
The only thing about segwit adoption you should be noticing is how few people actually care enough to use it.  Doesn't that tell you something? It means the people actually transacting on the blockchain don't care.  If it is important to you, use segwit.  If it isn't, don't.   Because this 'debate' isn't about blocksize or transaction cost.  It's about corporate interests trying to wrest control of the consensus rules of bitcoin away from the users.  The peers in bitcoin are the node owners.  Peer to peer is node to node.  They don't want these shit consensus rule changes as has been repeatedly demonstrated. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:41:37
The only thing you control is the consensus rules you are prepared to enforce with your node.  Everything else is just posturing.

The only reason the inflation exists in the first place right now is because there is no actual economic growth, only paper growth.  Businesses will invest in companies that earn more money through productivity increases, not companies that just shift around the paper records of debt-instruments.

Ya can't stop people running the code once it is released.  It was released.   There were about 150 nodes apparently.  If a miner mined it and produced a valid block for those consensus rules, it wouldda forked.  But the nodes stopped one block before the consensus rule change, because it was expecting the fork to start in the next block, and therefore the fork never happened.

 Run a node.  Use that node for your bitcoin transactions.  A node will even run over a tor connection by default if it has tor on the machine. 
Don't really care about alts.  None of them is really decentralized so none of them really offer the security of decentralization. 
This is the security model of bitcoin.  That's what people in this scalability discussion have been fighting for.  The protection of that security model.   Does it matter for $100?  $1000?  Probably not.   But if it is $10M?  $100M?  It really really does.  The security model applies equally to everyone.  That's decentralisation.  That's peer-to-peer.  That's what a node is, a peer.  An equal.

What you don't get, is that it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter what reasons people are getting into it, because the underlying technology is agnostic to the reasons for its acquisition.

I know what you mean.  I just don't subscribe to the same belief.  Investment requires an understanding of the asset you are acquiring, whether that is for dividends, or as a venture capitalist to invest in the seed round of a start-up so that you can sell your stock in the product for an increased price at some later date, or an asset you acquiring because you expect it to increase in value at a later date for justifiable reasons.  
Just so you know, this isn't my particular bent.  This is what I've gotten [from Warren Buffet](  When he invested in banks during the 2007 financial crisis, it wasn't because he was expecting dividends.  He was expecting to buy low and sell high.  And you don't get a bigger value investor than Warren Buffet.
All this is a bit of a muchness though.  If you don't want to invest in bitcoin don't.  I'm a big believer in making sure you don't invest in things you don't understand.  For me, it's stupid not to act on things that I know that, as it turns out, I've been pretty well spot-on in.

The number one rule of bitcoin is to never store your bitcoin on an exchange.  Number.  One.
Electrum is a light wallet, and a good one.  Learn how to use it.  Secure your bitcoin.  Backup every piece of information you are asked to record when you create a wallet.  Test it.  Move small amounts around with low fees and see what happens.
Protip.  Buy $10 in litecoin and download the open source electrum-ltc wallet.  The transactions fees are miniscule, and the interface, because it is the same open-source project, is almost the same as electrum for bitcoin.  Learn with really small amounts.
Good luck.

Haven't you at least started to grasp that they are the same thing?  It is sound money.  It is valuable because it is money.  And it is sound money. Which there is demand for.  And limited supply.  Which increases the value.  Because of demand.

It has actually taken me years to really absorb the ramifications of this technology, let alone understand it, and there is no question that there is so much more to get. It is pure genius.
I have my own interpretation of the bitcoin invention, that I think reflects my understanding. Maybe I'm just talking shit, but I reckon it's at least a little bit internally consistent. I'm building on it, because it helps clarify it for me.
This is actually a game theory problem. There are three groups in bitcoin. The users, the holders, and the miners. To understand the way that relationship works, you have to understand what keeps everyone separated and honest. That requires an understanding of the incentives of bitcoin, and that requires understanding what [proof-of-work]( is.
Proof-of-work aligns consensus with the users, because it is the users that are paying the miners through transaction fees. Even holders require users, and more importantly, node owners. Therefore, it is users that are incentivizing the miners. [Proof-of-stake]( aligns consensus with the holders, who are paying the miners. That is an incentive structure that reflects our current financial system. But bitcoin changes this through incentive structures and cryptography. In bitcoin, it is the incentive of the payers, not the paid, that imo is the wild invention of satoshi, and enacted through cryptography.
PoS fails because there is only one outcome given that incentive structure. Holders being miners, and then controlling the users. PoW overcomes this because the outcome is the constant tension between all three.
At the heart of the solution is the byzantine generals problem and/or the two generals problem.  The problem is "if you are a number of generals surrounding a castle, how do you give the attack date and ensure that the message to attack is correctly received, when you know that the message may be altered along the way?". There's game theory around what is possible, but that's the gist of it. I have reduced it to three. Given you know one is a traitor, how do you deliver the message to attack?  In the byzantine generals problem, a traitor may game the system to overcome two honest actors. 
The way that this is managed is that miners order the transactions, and race to hash them to an algorithm (the work in proof-of-work), which is in bitcoin, SHA-256, until they get an answer that will be accepted by the nodes (proof). They are incentivized to become more and more efficient, and spend more resources as the price increases. The nodes provide the proof in proof-of-work. For that work, the nodes award miners bitcoin. The nodes can prove which miner spent more work, but it sometimes takes a few blocks to get it right, which is why you have to wait for a few confirmations.
The only real thing that miners can threaten to do is stop users (the people paying them) from receiving blocks. Users and holders, after all, control their own cryptographic proofs to the tokens. But the current miners are only miners of SHA-256 pow algorithm blocks. In an adversarial condition, the miners will have just stopped coming to the party, so the users say 'fuck this' and change the pow. They get a new set of miners, mining a new algorithm, and the holders go 'holy shit, do I wanna spend my cash with a bunch of numpties that couldn't behave themselves?'. And they start spending their cash on the chain that the users say is the real one, and everyone just goes about their business again. Old miners get crushed. New miners think happy days. If the nodes change their software, that's the end of the story. Because the nodes define the consensus, they can. The remaining node owners get to decide whether they want to be owned by the miners, or whether they actually want to still remain users. The holders decide whether they are more likely to be able to realize their money with the miners that now control a drastically centralized subset of nodes, or to continue on in the system that led to their being holders in the first place.
Users can't attack the system, because then they would become holders, and users would no longer trust them for the reasons already stated, and they don't hold the cryptographic proofs of the holders. If the holders do that, they lose all of their users, so the only thing they game-theory-wise would do, would be to instate a pow. Why would anyone prefer a system in which the people with the money have all of the power? Otherwise known as the world financial system.
Whoever attacks loses, and there's no real way to cheat the system. That's the brilliant solution to the byzantine generals problem. It is a self-sustaining financial system that rewards everyone for participating in it, where incentives are perfectly aligned for its longevity, with an ever reducing supply of tokens that are effectively infinitely divisible, increasing their value per-capita. And no, there isn't any other system in the world that shares these properties.

 Get it into your head that  that it is only your use case and if you can't get bitcoin to work for your use case, you don't get to change everyone else's.  Bitcoin requires decentralization.  The node owners have repeatedly rejected sacrificing the bitcoin use case because noobs can't get their use cases to work.  Bitcoin didn't get to be the king because of noob use cases.  It got here because of its decentralization and rejection of repeated attacks to centralize.  If you don't like it, leave.  How much clearer can that be?

?  Dude.  I'm here for the long long haul.  I know why I'm not worried, because I know what separates bitcoin from shitcoins.  Shitcoins will be pumped.  Shitcoins will be dumped.  They are cryptocurrencies in name only, because their entire structure is centralized into a few decision-makers, who can make any change to the code of their shitcoins that they like.  Bitcoin nodes are decentralized on a massive level, and other "cryptos" aren't even on the same planet, let alone city or ball-park.   Node owners have to adopt changes in their entirety, or they get rejected.  
The nodes in bitcoin are conservative.  They don't really care about fees.  They care about security.  That decentralized security isn't going down in value, it's going up, as the price of bitcoin will demonstrate, and has demonstrated.  Sure there will be pull-backs, and surges.  That's bitcoin.  That's what happens when you have a market with low liquidity and high velocity.

They're copying the blockchain because they can't build their own node infrastructure. So they actually give bitcoin holders tokens in their system for free just on the hope that they will use it.  All they do is multiply peoples bitcoin holdings.
There are sooooo many people who don't grasp this concept in bitcoin. They're the ones that keep saying that bitcoin is like myspace.

For them, it is control it and insert themselves into the architecture, or go out of business.  Ask yourself : if transaction fees were so important, why isn't coinbase using segwit?  They were prepared to adopt a contentious hard-fork requiring all of their infrastructure to be migrated to a different blockchain.  And they can't adopt segwit?

The only way I can see a PoW change being enacted is if centralized miners attack the bitcoin SHA-256 chain.  The change to nodes to a different PoW will be trivial, and there will be a couple of weeks for people to upgrade their nodes, but the effect on the SHA-256 miners will be devastating and permanent.  Miners know this, which is they they have repeatedly backed away from any threat to attack the bitcoin SHA-256 chain.

And where is it now?  Bitcoin would have to drop to $1600 per bitcoin to only have doubled in value in the past year.  So I reckon a year-on-year doubling is a pretty good store of value for me.


I said no such thing.


It is cash.  There is no exchange required.  
Think of bitcoin as USD when you travel in Europe.  It'll make it easier to understand.  You don't sell all your USD for your trip do you?
You are still thinking of bitcoin as an asset and an asset alone.  It isn't.  It's the cash.  It is exchanging one money for another money, except the money I have is inflation resistant, and yours punishes savers by design.  I think I'll keep my money in the inflation resistant one thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:01:00
Ah the ol no intrinsic value meme. I use [the 1:10000 rule]( for this argument.  It is my opinion that the intrinsic value of bitcoin is far far greater than anyone really comprehends.  People generally are too focused on people just buying and selling the asset, but not about the cryptographic proof, and incentive structure that perpetuates the network functioning.  So when people like to ask what the intrinsic value of bitcoin is, I say :
You are thinking of the store of value property without the cryptographic property that secures it. You are talking about it as one would talk about valuable shells, and even shell sellers, and not the security that separates it from all forms of value exchange before it. To understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin it is good to use the analogy of an envelope. So i ask you : does an envelope have intrinsic value?
If I have a letter that I need to send securely, would I prefer to send it open, and ready to be read? Or would I prefer for it to be sent within the confines of an envelope? Now let's think... would I prefer to just leave an open envelope, or would I think it necessary to put some seal across it to ensure that it isn't opened, and read whilst en-route. Does a sealable envelope have more intrinsic value than an unsealable one? Hmm... but what if someone can counterfeit the seal? I need some method of ensuring that the message I want to get to that person isn't read, and preferably, isn't even identified as a message. That's when you need to get lawyers involved. Sounds expensive. There's obviously something intrinsically valuable about such a service, because many people pay oh-so-very-much money for it.
Now let's imagine we're not talking about letters, we're talking about money. Would you address a $100 note through the mail to your child for their birthday? You'd pay for a stamp at least. Would you encase it in an envelope that you paid for at the local post-shop? Hmm... bill in the envelope.  Anyone will be able to see that it is money. Perhaps encase it in a card? What if it is $1000? $10,000? $10 million?  Does the protection service of an envelope somehow decrease because the value of the contents of the package increases? It's the opposite, isn't it? Bitcoin is both the cryptographically sealed envelope, and the network to deliver it.
What say you? Is an envelope intrinsically valuable?

The only message you should be saying about bitcoin is this :
Bitcoin: Be your own bank.  Don't let charlatans and shysters convince you that they are looking after your interests.  They are not.

A bet is a bet.  They borrow on the expectation they will be able to pay back the original by acquiring more at a cheaper price.  It is not rocket surgery.  That's great if you have a market that offers a speed of transaction greater than the market being bet upon.  Except bitcoin isn't like that.  It is already insanely volatile, anonymously liquid, and completely unregulated. 
The arbitrage opportunities will bring in even more money.  Further constraining that supply.

That's actually not that bad.  It takes into consideration the price that people are willing to pay for the asset.  So unless 2x has greater than 80% of both the hashing and the value, they aren't referred to as bitcoin.
There's zero chance of that shitcoin having anywhere near the value of bitcoin, so it's bye-bye 2x.  In all likelihood, it'll be 80-90% value to bitcoin, and probably starting at 75% hashing, and within a couple of days, I expect that'll be down to 50/50.  The big question is whether 2x will survive to January.

But you know, that's the way it is supposed to work.  You lend money to people so that they can produce things that people who hold currency feel that they will spend on.   The problem in our financial system is that lending has been used to inflate the price of non productive assets. 
In a world in which things always grow, that's great.  But unchecked growth in a world getting older encourages asset accumulation instead of productivity increases.   That is being played out right before our eyes.

@_date: 2017-11-11 11:40:38
I get it.   This is something I've said before but it applies.   I use [the 1:10000 rule]( for some of this stuff.  
Let me explain why i do not worry.  It has actually taken me years to really absorb the ramifications of this technology, let alone understand it, and there is no question that there is so much more to get. It is pure genius.
I have my own interpretation of the bitcoin invention, that I think reflects my understanding. Maybe I'm just talking shit, but I reckon it's at least a little bit internally consistent. I'm building on it, because it helps clarify it for me.
This is actually a game theory problem. There are three groups in bitcoin. The users, the holders, and the miners. To understand the way that relationship works, you have to understand what keeps everyone separated and honest. That requires an understanding of the incentives of bitcoin, and that requires understanding what [proof-of-work]( is.
Proof-of-work aligns consensus with the users, because it is the users that are paying the miners through transaction fees. Even holders require users, and more importantly, node owners. Therefore, it is users that are incentivizing the miners. [Proof-of-stake]( aligns consensus with the holders, who are paying the miners. That is an incentive structure that reflects our current financial system. But bitcoin changes this through incentive structures and cryptography. In bitcoin, it is the incentive of the payers, not the paid, that imo is the wild invention of satoshi, and enacted through cryptography.
PoS fails because there is only one outcome given that incentive structure. Holders being miners, and then controlling the users. PoW overcomes this because the outcome is the constant tension between all three.
At the heart of the solution is the byzantine generals problem and/or the two generals problem.  The problem is "if you are a number of generals surrounding a castle, how do you give the attack date and ensure that the message to attack is correctly received, when you know that the message may be altered along the way?". There's game theory around what is possible, but that's the gist of it. I have reduced it to three. Given you know one is a traitor, how do you deliver the message to attack?  In the byzantine generals problem, a traitor may game the system to overcome two honest actors. 
The way that this is managed is that miners order the transactions, and race to hash them to an algorithm (the work in proof-of-work), which is in bitcoin, SHA-256, until they get an answer that will be accepted by the nodes (proof). They are incentivized to become more and more efficient, and spend more resources as the price increases. The nodes provide the proof in proof-of-work. For that work, the nodes award miners bitcoin. The nodes can prove which miner spent more work, but it sometimes takes a few blocks to get it right, which is why you have to wait for a few confirmations.
The only real thing that miners can threaten to do is stop users (the people paying them) from receiving blocks. Users and holders, after all, control their own cryptographic proofs to the tokens. But the current miners are only miners of SHA-256 pow algorithm blocks. In an adversarial condition, the miners will have just stopped coming to the party, so the users say 'fuck this' and change the pow. They get a new set of miners, mining a new algorithm, and the holders go 'holy shit, do I wanna spend my cash with a bunch of numpties that couldn't behave themselves?'. And they start spending their cash on the chain that the users say is the real one, and everyone just goes about their business again. Old miners get crushed. New miners think happy days. If the nodes change their software, that's the end of the story. Because the nodes define the consensus, they can. The remaining node owners get to decide whether they want to be owned by the miners, or whether they actually want to still remain users. The holders decide whether they are more likely to be able to realize their money with the miners that now control a drastically centralized subset of nodes, or to continue on in the system that led to their being holders in the first place.
Users can't attack the system, because then they would become holders, and users would no longer trust them for the reasons already stated, and they don't hold the cryptographic proofs of the holders. If the holders do that, they lose all of their users, so the only thing they game-theory-wise would do, would be to instate a pow. Why would anyone prefer a system in which the people with the money have all of the power? Otherwise known as the world financial system.
Whoever attacks loses, and there's no real way to cheat the system. That's the brilliant solution to the byzantine generals problem. It is a self-sustaining financial system that rewards everyone for participating in it, where incentives are perfectly aligned for its longevity, with an ever reducing supply of tokens that are effectively infinitely divisible, increasing their value per-capita. And no, there isn't any other system in the world that shares these properties.
Like I said, SN was/is/will be a genius.

Yes, but unlike in an inflationary system, increasing the number of coins you own is not required, because you're not relying upon there being any new coins.  It's the opposite.  Therefore, the more coins that are lost by others, the greater the value of your coins.  The dividend isn't the coin amount, it's the value per coin.
I think it's even more complex than that.  It's like a virus sucking up fixed-asset debt.

By selling it as something that it's not.  Bitcoin is decentralized.  BCH is not.  The primary selling point of bitcoin is its decentralization, and the ability for anyone to run a node, and therefore be a peer in peer-to-peer cash.  But they have specifically jettisoned the peers in their hard-fork, and so therefore are no longer bitcoin.

When i think about it, i expect the discount counts for each ingoing and outgoing address.  Segwit - segwit best.  Non segwit to segwit second best. I'm still not sure though that going segwit to non segwit provides the discount, because that (i think) means the segwit input script has to be unwrapped and converted to a standard bitcoin txn.

Sigh.... Henceforth be thy lesson : 
So let's talk about nodes and consensus as defined in the whitepaper and implemented in nodes.
 Let's start with [the bitcoin white paper]( :


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




What does this mean if you are but an intrepid traveler amongst the erstwhile numpty-folk?
Nodes are agents in a multi-agent system with [an agreed set of consensus rules]( which they and they alone enforce, that ensure that the system functions. Transactions are propagated through the multi-agent network based upon the agreed consensus rules by nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Miners retrieve valid transactions from any of these nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then order the transactions, and perform a hashing function on them until the hashing function returns a value that is suitable to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then pass the new block that they've created to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. The nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, then validate the block to ensure that each of the transactions within the block agree with the consensus rules. Then the node, which is an agent in a multi-agent system, extends the block-chain by attaching the new block to it.  They then pass the new block, if it is valid, to other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Then each of these other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, each do the same validation on every block.
Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node extends the blockchain.  Miners don't.  The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.  It is the validation of the nodes, and their CPU's, that define and police consensus in bitcoin.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.  Miners work.  Nodes validate.  So nodes are the proof in proof-of-work. 
Nodes accept the transactions, validate the transactions (using their CPU), replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks (using their CPU), extend the blockchain (using their CPU), replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.  If you can't convince these node owners that are using their node on a day-to-day basis, to uninstall their node software and install your new node client, especially when that node client decreases their node security and decreases the network security, any change you have is going to go exactly nowhere.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.  If you can't convince all of those node owners running their node clients to uninstall one client and re-install another, any change you have to consensus is DOA.

Hey you know what's funny?  Most of the things i say i do actually do with a smile.  That is lost in the medium of course.  What i try to be is consistent. 
I work to the [1:10000 rule.](   If i see the same bs argument i have the same response.   It's the only method I've found that is successful to cut through in this medium.  Because bitcoin is essentially money, it is always going to have underlying tension.  There is nothing wrong with changing you're mind, but ya have to be able to support your argument.  If you can't, you should be questioning why you are arguing.  And because it is money, some people just want to steal yours.  I don't really like that argument.

Why didn't it remain?  Surely with all of that consensus it's done and dusted.  Why didn't it activate then?  They had the consensus didn't they?

Lightning is peer to peer.  Even the concept of a node doesn't apply, as it is only a routing mechanism between already existing channels between peers.  A channel is a channel is a channel is a channel.  This whole concept of a 'massive hub' doesn't even exist.  It can't even be explained by the people who use the term, because they don't even understand how channels are made.

If you don't understand the value proposition, there is no use investing in it.  It is always a good idea to understand the value proposition of any investment, otherwise it is just gambling.  There are lots of gamblers in bitcoin, but why wouldn't there be?  
I, however, am not a gambler.  I understand bitcoin for what it is :  A disruptive technology in banking, finance, and currency.  It is going to do to consumer banking what the internet did to magazine publishing.  Ultimately, this is a disruptive technology in the things even above banking, finance and currency.  It is a disruptive technology in the identification, classification, and distribution of value.
The identification of value is at the core of all monetary interactions between people.  What one person values, another person does not.  Bitcoin is transforming that interaction.

I'm saying that I think bitcoin will replace inflation.  It will do this, because it is going to be an ever decreasing supply of coins.  Most people don't realize it, but the number of one bitcoin is an arbitrary value.  The base unit in bitcoin is colloquially known as a satoshi, and there are 100,000,000 satoshis for every bitcoin.  But in the future, if it is deemed necessary, it will be possible to further divide the currency into ever more fine units.  What you can't do is increase the unit count.


I think house prices are going to shrink significantly, so they will be, by definition, risky investments.  That's the long-term effect of pricking the consumer debt bubble.


Yep.  It's risk.  For risk there is reward.  Some risks don't pay off.  Some do.  It'll be important to understand the thing you're investing in.  No such thing as a free lunch.


And this gets to the crux of it.  Growth in western societies is a mirage, and has been for some decades.  It has been fueled by finance, which is just numbers on a page.  Productivity, which is supposed to be working less to achieve the same productive outcome, or working the same to achieve growth, has been going sideways or backwards.  That's because people have been rewarded not by increasing productivity, but increasing their share of an inflating asset, i.e. debt based currency.
It is my opinion that growth, as measured in productivity, will increase significantly.  But growth, if, for example, you were in the financial industry, will decrease significantly.  Because our financial system is so geared to that debt-inflation cycle, it will look like growth is going backwards, whereas really, a lot of very rich people will be worth less money.  I certainly don't own, nor will I buy, any bank stocks.  Investment bankers for industry should do extremely well though.

[electrum]( as a light wallet is available in both a desktop and android version.
Or use an actual [node wallet](  That's the most secure, but they do use a lot of computer resources.  The node wallet is the most secure method, because it fully validates the blockchain with no trust required at all.
Both of these wallets, if you're particularly security conscious, allow you to create transactions on one pc, and sign the transactions on another air-gapped pc (i.e. cold storage), and then broadcast the transaction on the connected pc.  That provides as good security as is generally possible to implement.  [These]( are usage instructions in electrum.

Ah the ol no intrinsic value meme. I use [the 1:10000 rule]( for this argument.  It is my opinion that the intrinsic value of bitcoin is far far greater than anyone really comprehends.  People generally are too focused on people just buying and selling the asset, but not about the cryptographic proof, and incentive structure that perpetuates the network functioning.  So when people like to ask what the intrinsic value of bitcoin is, I say :
You are thinking of the store of value property without the cryptographic property that secures it. You are talking about it as one would talk about valuable shells, and even shell sellers, and not the security that separates it from all forms of value exchange before it. To understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin it is good to use the analogy of an envelope. So i ask you : does an envelope have intrinsic value?
If I have a letter that I need to send securely, would I prefer to send it open, and ready to be read? Or would I prefer for it to be sent within the confines of an envelope? Now let's think... would I prefer to just leave an open envelope, or would I think it necessary to put some seal across it to ensure that it isn't opened, and read whilst en-route. Does a sealable envelope have more intrinsic value than an unsealable one? Hmm... but what if someone can counterfeit the seal? I need some method of ensuring that the message I want to get to that person isn't read, and preferably, isn't even identified as a message. That's when you need to get lawyers involved. Sounds expensive. There's obviously something intrinsically valuable about such a service, because many people pay oh-so-very-much money for it.
Now let's imagine we're not talking about letters, we're talking about money. Would you address a $100 note through the mail to your child for their birthday? You'd pay for a stamp at least. Would you encase it in an envelope that you paid for at the local post-shop? Hmm... bill in the envelope.  Anyone will be able to see that it is money. Perhaps encase it in a card? What if it is $1000? $10,000? $10 million?  Does the protection service of an envelope somehow decrease because the value of the contents of the package increases? It's the opposite, isn't it? Bitcoin is both the cryptographically sealed envelope, and the network to deliver it.
What say you? Is an envelope intrinsically valuable?

What you people continually fail to grasp is that no one cares about your opinion.

You clearly don't get it.  You lost.  The nodes, the things that enforce consensus, don't want your consensus rule changes.  The nodes don't want your hard-fork.

@_date: 2017-11-16 06:33:52
That's the implication, yes.  But I think it's something more subtle.  I don't foresee fiat going away any time soon.  what I think bitcoin is going to do, is deflate the worlds fixed asset credit bubble.
Said [here]( mostly I think bitcoin will finally separate the good debt from the bad debt. It is my personal belief ( as in i don't know of any formal theory ) that debt should only be incurred for the use of building a productive asset. In a deflationary currency, this encourages businesses to ensure that productivity increases will have greater returns than savings. Instead, our financial system has encouraged the acquisition of debt for fixed assets. The only thing this has done is bid up the price of those fixed debts with debt, and handed over the money for supporting that system to banks and their owners. In order to stimulate growth in such a system, the only way that you can function is to tax savings. That's what inflation is.  What it forces people to do is to invest in increasingly risky assets, because of the loss of their purchasing power.  Hence bubble after bubble after bubble.  Crisis after crisis after crisis.
Bitcoin will eventually stabilize to an ever appreciating value asset. But what it will allow you to do is save for a house. If you have a business proposal that encourages people to pay you for a good or service, people will invest their savings in it and take on that risk.  Banks will instead move back to providing capital to businesses, using savings from people that are willing to invest.  Businesses will again focus on productivity increases, because that's how you get access to capital.
I also don't think it is going to be resisted quite as much as people think it will be. People still need to pay their taxes, and that is not going to stop. The main thing it is going to do is prick the bubble of consumer debt, and remove the banking middle-men from that space. That alone is a multi-trillion dollar industry, let alone the annuities that banks own and graft from, from those assets. Removing these people (i.e. banking debt suppliers) from positions of power, by strangling their access to capital, is a justification for bitcoin in its own right. Imagine a world in which banks didn't control governments. 
That's the way it is supposed to work i think.  It is pure genius.

When you realize bitcoin is either zero or non zero, the only question becomes what non zero value  will it stabilize at.  Doesnt look like it is anywhere even close to finding that value, because the price is anything but stable.

Oh really?  How about we ask my partner.  She's a professor in neuro-pyschology.  You know, the people who actually invent the tests for intelligence, and then undertake the tests.
Yes.  Let's ask the professor and scientist who is an actual expert in the construction and validation of iq tests shall we? She says :
All of the studies that have shown those things you are parroting have ALL been shown to be as a result of bias in the testing methodology, and once you control for socioeconomic status and education, all variation disappears. The only way this is even discussed in science now is as an example of how to construct tests to remove bias. The iq tests that were used in the 60s are now only used as examples of how cultural and socio-economic bias in test creation needs to be considered in the construction of a test.
She also gave me a really distasteful look. The words stupid and racist were also used.

I don't give a shit about your use-cases.  Your suggestions on how bitcoin should function have been repeatedly rejected.  Not once, but four times (XT, Classic, BU, 2x).  Stop it.

For not very seriously, there is a lot of money on offer for exchanging your bch for bitcoin.  tens of billions.


With every attack repelled the underlying technology and its decentralized implementation is shown to be what is claimed : it is anti-fragile.  It isn't getting weaker, it is getting stronger.  Stronger against everything.  The next big attacker is likely to be a state actor, and it will be lots of people wailing and gnashing their teeth, until bitcoin again overcomes the attempts to fight it.
The only way that bitcoin can be overcome is if there is another decentralized method that provides even sounder money.  And right now, there isn't even a concept that you can point to that does so.  Bitcoin is the reckoning for the fixed-asset debt bubble.  It will not have achieved its aim until it has been swept away.

I'm being truthful.  No-confirmation transactions were never secure, and they never will be.  


It is trivially easy.  Once you know how to do it you could do it with 100% effectiveness.  You think convincing non-technical retail owners that the bitcoin POS system they're installing is risk-free when there is a method that could work 100% of the time to defraud them of a purchase is a good thing?  I do not.
Back in the old days, people cared less.  They were more interested in the tech.  Not many people really use it though.  Now that there are sophisticated assholes, it is totally insecure.
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:35:47
Man, I don't care.  I'm just suggesting that if they want to actually be a technology company, they should focus on the technology and not the politics.  Open bazaar with both a marketplace and a decentralized exchange of small-time transactions, with the ability to leverage these transactions into 2nd level networks, they could establish themselves as a hub of crypto that would shit all over shapeshift.  They'd even be able to pretty straightforwardly monetize it.  With their own payment channels to a company like coinbase, they could use their merchants and users, however few there might be now, to build channels with themselves, funded by their users, and provide instant as-good-as-free transactions.  They would even be able to charge micro-fees, and people would gladly pay.  User goes to coinbase, puts $50 back in their account, and it is returned to them via the Coinbase-&gt;OB1-&gt;user channel.  Two hops.  Totally bypassing the blockchain, but still in bitcoin.
You know what's funny?  bch doesn't have the malleability fix.  So they won't even be able to implement payment channels in their coin, let alone atomic swaps.  How fkn stupid is that?  Choose the tech that limits your ability out of sheer stubbornness.  That's gonna make ya go far.

Hey, i just thought of another effect it will have.  When it stabilizes, prices for things you buy in bitcoin will gradually decrease in price. Doh.  But items that are similar but better will get more expensive.  Finally the wonks that come up with hedonic adjustments to inflation statistics, will be able to apply their time productively, because they would be able to accurately measure productivity improvements.   Because there is an upper bound on bitcoin, their statistics will finally be constrained.  You won't be able to lie.

Not OP, but I think it will happen in the less established currencies before it is adopted for that type of transaction in the mainstream currency economies like USD and EUR.

I think it will be a decade or more before it is accepted at scale in established first world economies though.

It is my opinion that the intrinsic value of bitcoin is far far greater than anyone really comprehends.  People generally are too focused on people just buying and selling the asset, but not about the cryptographic proof, and incentive structure that perpetuates the network functioning.  So when people like to ask what the intrinsic value of bitcoin is, I say :
You are thinking of the store of value property without the cryptographic property that secures it. You are talking about it as one would talk about valuable shells, and even shell sellers, and not the security that separates it from all forms of value exchange before it. To understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin it is good to use the analogy of an envelope. So i ask you : does an envelope have intrinsic value?
If I have a letter that I need to send securely, would I prefer to send it open, and ready to be read? Or would I prefer for it to be sent within the confines of an envelope. Now let's think... would I prefer to just leave an open envelope, or would I think it necessary to put some seal across it to ensure that it isn't opened, and read whilst en-route. Does a sealable envelope have more intrinsic value than an unsealable one? Hmm... but what if someone can counterfeit the seal? I need some method of ensuring that the message I want to get to that person isn't read, and preferably, isn't even identified as a message. That's when you need to get lawyers involved. Sounds expensive. There's obviously something intrinsically valuable about such a service, because many people pay oh-so-very-much money for it.
Now let's imagine we're not talking about letters, we're talking about money. Would you address a $100 note through the mail to your child for their birthday? You'd pay for a stamp at least. Would you encase it in an envelope that you paid for at the local post-shop? Hmm... bill in the envelope.  Anyone will be able to see that it is money. Perhaps encase it in a card? What if it is $1000? $10,000? $10 million?  Does the protection service of an envelope somehow decrease because the value of the contents of the package increases? It's the opposite, isn't it? Bitcoin is both the cryptographically sealed envelope, and the network to deliver it.
What say you? Is an envelope intrinsically valuable?

I agree.   They actually took the long term view and fixed the problem.  It was unsustainable. 
I have a lot less hate than most people would think for bch.  They did replay protection.  Ver is a crazy lying cockhead but that's beside the point.  It is massively centralized but some people don't care.  They shouldn't be using the name but meh. 
It is nothing more than insurance really.  For miners.  At least if bitcoin ever pow changes, there is always an established crypto for sha-256 miners.  It's a shitcoin, but there are worse ones TBH.  I'd use it over ripple.

@_date: 2017-11-17 03:07:12
Interesting insight.  It's obviously the case, risk-wise.  When I think about about it, it couldn't really be any other way.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:03:17
It's all about statistical probability.  If a block gets solved at time X, over the next ten minutes (let's just say 600 seconds) anyone of those 600 seconds is equally as likely as any other for the next block to be solved.  Each second there is a 1/600 chance of the block being solved.  It could, and of course does, sometimes take longer than that, because that 1/600 probability chance keeps not getting hit.  But if a block has just been solved, the next block might happen one second later, leaving only one second to order transactions.  If there's not enough time, the reward is more important, so it is submitted.  Of course, when I say 1/600, it's actually [1/10,000,000,000,000,000,000]( or thereabouts.
So you get one block with transactions, followed by a block quickly after it with less or no transactions.

That's exactly what they do.  They vote by choosing which node they run for transactions they make and therefore which consensus rules to apply.  For now those nodes are core reference nodes. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:24:21


Not really.  The blocksize increase was a compromise.  It's funny that too, because the main guy against a block size increase, dashjr, was the guy who was instrumental in delivering  the increase via a soft-fork.   The main thing the segwit patch provided was the malleability fix that enabled good safe 2nd layer solutions. 
The txn cost is mostly hot air.  The great bulk of people that use bitcoin couldn't give a shit.  You can tell that because they generally don't care about using the segwit process even when it will reduce fees. 
The debate was never about blocksize.  It as a takeover attempt of the consensus rules.  Scalability will be achieved via 2nd layer solutions.  I suspect it will be some years before a hard-fork is required, if ever.  Realistically, i don't think it will happen unless a centralized miner attacks the sha-256 chain. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:26:14

Either way, you aren't getting what you want, which would require 100,000+ bitcoin nodes adopting your change.  So if bitcoin isn't meeting your use-case, stop using it.  No one is forcing you to.  You know where the doors is.  Goodbye.

Bitcoin without decentralization is worthless.  Anything that reduces decentralization is to be avoided.  Larger blocks increase the resource requirements of nodes.  More resource requirements of nodes leads to nodes being switched off because users can't commit resources to running them.  Less nodes means more centralization.  Therefore, the larger the blocks, the more worthless bitcoin becomes.
Couldn't give a shit about fees.  As we're seeing with segwit adoption, most people feel the same way.

@_date: 2017-11-04 06:04:23
If people were actually interested as much as you say  for using bitcoin for over the counter transactions, they would be spending more time and effort building layer 2 solutions. They aren't.

I prefer to think of it as freeing up money for instantaneous transactions.  When you read this development you realise you could be paying 1/25 the txn cost you are paying now to even set up a channel and pay someone, and it will be  instantaneous even cheaper txns after that.

Au contraire dear sir.  While I have a good understanding of socialism, and don't treat it like the bogeyman that many americans do, this is definitely not socialism.  In that system, gains or losses would have to be shared.  In government, social democracies (which are essentially every democracy) are the only ones that seem to work long-term.
Perhaps it is pure capitalism?  And by that, I mean that the world we live in isn't pure capitalism, because pure capitalism requires a check on monopolistic behavior, because the asset accumulators write the laws to their advantage, and against the tenets of capitalism.  Re:American telcos!

 No ability for a central authority to restrict payments. 


Because the value of things measured against it are increasing at productive growth, and coins that are forever lost. More things are getting built.  More coins get lost permanently.  So there are less units ( however infinitely divisible) per unit of production.

I can't see why it won't be possible to use lightning to increase the amount of a channel.  Roll the remaining value into a transaction, and increase the value of the channel, and reset the ratio.  It'll require a transaction I'd assume, but with the close out of the previous channel and signature aggregation, you will have done it with three txns not four.

Regulation put in place by the very monopolists that benefit from it, by having laws changed so that only they can function in that environment.
It is but a quibble though.  When there are people it is invariably complex.  That is the beauty of bitcoin.  It directly connects people.   No permission required from government, company, or other third party.
I said this elsewhere recently :
Freedom is hard. Actually requiring probable cause before being subjected to the justice system used to be a thing. Then the US government started stealing peoples money without ever even charging them with a crime. So now we have crypto. So the government can't do it anymore. "But but but what if they are committing a crime!" they say. Prove it i say. You know. Rule of law. That's what democracies are supposed to be about aren't they?
And that attack on freedom now has crypto as a response. The thing that it is counter-intuitive about crypto, is that the solution to electronic anonymous and censorship resistant money, turned out being record everything forever.  what kind of genius comes up with that? When someone can flick a switch and take everything from you, you don't have freedom. When you can access the ledger from anyone, prove that it it is valid, and be able to send your money to anyone, for whatever purpose, you do.
This technology has been developed as a direct response to the insidious and anti-democratic implementation of AML/KYC laws on a global scale over the past 30 years. The extrapolation of these laws, given a long enough timeline, is slavery. Not figurative slavery, actual slavery.
Bitcoin is the technical response to that problem.

@_date: 2017-11-27 03:14:01
I use [the 1:10000 rule]( for this argument.  It is my opinion that the intrinsic value of bitcoin is far far greater than anyone really comprehends.  People generally are too focused on people just buying and selling the asset, but not about the cryptographic proof, and incentive structure that perpetuates the network functioning.  So when people like to ask what the intrinsic value of bitcoin is, I say :
You are thinking of the store of value property without the cryptographic property that secures it. You are talking about it as one would talk about valuable shells, and even shell sellers, and not the security that separates it from all forms of value exchange before it. To understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin it is good to use the analogy of an envelope. So i ask you : does an envelope have intrinsic value?
If I have a letter that I need to send securely, would I prefer to send it open, and ready to be read? Or would I prefer for it to be sent within the confines of an envelope? Now let's think... would I prefer to just leave an open envelope, or would I think it necessary to put some seal across it to ensure that it isn't opened, and read whilst en-route. Does a sealable envelope have more intrinsic value than an unsealable one? Hmm... but what if someone can counterfeit the seal? I need some method of ensuring that the message I want to get to that person isn't read, and preferably, isn't even identified as a message. That's when you need to get lawyers involved. Sounds expensive. There's obviously something intrinsically valuable about such a service, because many people pay oh-so-very-much money for it.
Now let's imagine we're not talking about letters, we're talking about money. Would you address a $100 note through the mail to your child for their birthday? You'd pay for a stamp at least. Would you encase it in an envelope that you paid for at the local post-shop? Hmm... bill in the envelope.  Anyone will be able to see that it is money. Perhaps encase it in a card? What if it is $1000? $10,000? $10 million?  Does the protection service of an envelope somehow decrease because the value of the contents of the package increases? It's the opposite, isn't it? Bitcoin is both the cryptographically sealed envelope, and the network to deliver it.
What say you? Is an envelope intrinsically valuable?
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:20:39
And I was right.
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:55:43

Yes.  They are an issue.  You don't know if you're going to be replay attacked with them in the 2x fork.  You could have all of your bitcoin exchanged for 2x without your knowledge or consent.
[electrum]( as a light wallet is available in both a desktop and android version.
Or use an actual [node wallet](  That's the most secure, but they do use a lot of computer resources.  The node wallet is the most secure method, because it fully validates the blockchain with no trust required at all.
Both of these wallets, if you're particularly security conscious, allow you to create transactions on one pc, and sign the transactions on another air-gapped pc (i.e. cold storage), and then broadcast the transaction on the connected pc.  That provides as good security as is generally possible to implement.  [These]( are usage instructions in electrum.

Dude, the security is as good as it gets.  The signature aggregation scheme doesn't really have a weakness.  There is as little risk in that as there is in bitcoin IMO.  There is obviously the logistics implementation of channel closures and openings, but they are not really game changers. 
you know what i think?  I don't think people really care.  I think the growth of lightning will be organic.  Right now, in our world, a bitcoin debit card, which already talks to all of the paywave terminals, is far more effective.   I don't think it even has the possibility of replacing that system until you can use the same paywave technology.  It has to be seamless.  Until it does, you are more likely to use lightning with your local dealer.   Localbitcoins through lightning to your geographical area?  Far more effective use case.
But for the foreseeable future, the main use case of bitcoin is as a hedge against inflation.

I completely and utterly disagree with that statement.  Bitcoin is a once-in-a-thousand year invention that is only getting started.  It is a marvel. As long as most of the people running nodes and actually using bitcoin (and not exchanges) actually know what they are doing, it doesn't really matter what the market is doing.  It will take care of itself.  You are thinking way too  small IMO.  Ya gotta learn how this shit works.  Because if it does work, it is going to be really important to know how to do it right.

The safety of bitcoin is defined by the decentralization of its nodes, and the fact that they are used to transact bitcoin.  No other alt comes even close, which is why no alt is considered a store of value like bitcoin is.
People who have yet to understand what nakamoto consensus actually is never understand where the value lies.  I used to be there.  Everyone was at some point.  It's a complex subject.

No.  He's not.  The unit hasn't changed, only the fraction.  More satoshi's don't get created.  Satoshi's get divided.  There are 21 million bitcoins.  That means there are 2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshi's.  If that number increases, there it is inflation.  But what dividing will do is create 100,000,000 units for every satoshi.  The number of satoshi's don't change.  The only thing that happens is you have a really fine fraction of satoshis.
You're saying that a person who cuts a pizza increases the number of pizzas.  No.  It's still one pizza.  It has just been divided into multiple parts.

I got a bitcoin debit card.  I use it for my beer money.  Every couple of weeks i put my beer money in.  When the balance gets to 3 figures, i migrate most of it to a wallet.  This way my spare cash is in bitcoin. 
I have a coinjar swipe eftpos card. It's an Australian thing, but I'm sure there are lots of variants. I set an auto replenish for under $100.  Whenever i need cash, or more often, buy a beer, i use the card.  Within the next 15 minutes, the account is credited from my bitcoin on that exchange (ya ya i know) at the current exchange rate.  Rinse.  Repeat.
This way the cash i normally need is always in bitcoin.  And my stack slowly grows, funded by my beer money.

Nope.  A regulatory body (like china for instance) could step into BCH and kill it in a day.  The larger the blocks get, the easier this becomes, because there will be less and less nodes.  Its 'security model' is actually the opposite of one.  The more it is actually used, the less secure it becomes, and the less valuable it becomes.

I think a lot of traders bought bitcoin for the chance at the hard-fork dump.  Now it is called off, and those traders have exited.  They've looked for the best pump-dump to use in the short-term, and that's BCH.  Just traders being traders.
What's really interesting for me, is that it is showing the amount of money in the market controlled by those traders.  About four billion dollars.  That's how much extra trade has been in the market over the past 24 hours.  When you really think about it, it's not that much.

@_date: 2017-11-28 07:17:39
This is a [1:10000 rule]( argument for me.  I think bitcoin will finally separate the good debt from the bad debt. It is my personal belief ( as in i don't know of any formal theory ) that debt should only be incurred for the use of building a productive asset. In a deflationary currency, this encourages businesses to ensure that productivity increases will have greater returns than savings. Instead, our financial system has encouraged the acquisition of debt for fixed assets. The only thing this has done is bid up the price of those fixed debts with debt, and handed over the money for supporting that system to banks and their owners. In order to stimulate growth in such a system, the only way that you can function is to tax savings. That's what inflation is.  What it forces people to do is to invest in increasingly risky assets, because of the loss of their purchasing power.  Hence bubble after bubble after bubble.  Crisis after crisis after crisis.
Bitcoin will eventually stabilize to an ever appreciating value asset. But what it will allow you to do is save for a house. If you have a business proposal that encourages people to pay you for a good or service, people will invest their savings in it and take on that risk.  Banks will instead move back to providing capital to businesses, using savings from people that are willing to invest.  Businesses will again focus on productivity increases, because that's how you get access to capital.
I also don't think it is going to be resisted quite as much as people think it will be. People still need to pay their taxes, and that is not going to stop. The main thing it is going to do is prick the bubble of consumer debt, and remove the banking middle-men from that space. That alone is a multi-trillion dollar industry, let alone the annuities that banks own and graft from, from those assets. Removing these people (i.e. banking debt suppliers) from positions of power, by strangling their access to capital, is a justification for bitcoin in its own right. Imagine a world in which banks didn't control governments. 
That's the way it is supposed to work i think.  It is pure genius.

I give plenty of advice.  Rule  : Never store your bitcoin on an exchange.  If people are using bitcoin and are not obeying rule number one, then they clearly don't understand the risk associated with not following rule number one.  They don't need soothing words.  I would prefer if they didn't lose everything, which is why I want them to assume that they will lose everything.  Do.  Not.  Store.  Your.  Bitcoin.  On.  An.  Exchange.  If you don't follow that rule after having it explained explicitly, then expect to lose your money.  I can't make it any plainer.

Segwit had a number of fixes.  It also included the quadratic hashing bug fix.  Which is again funny, because that fix increases the safety of larger blocks.  
When it was being developed, the battle over classic was raging.  One day dashjr came up with the silver bullet.  We want all this other stuff, but we'll also include a blocksize increase, and do it all via a soft-fork.  The fact that it gave the people of classic exactly what they were asking for and they still fought it tells you that their motivations had nothing to do with blocksizes and fees. 
@_date: 2016-02-23 03:25:58
Everyone knows the justification. Lots of people disagree on its requirement **right now**. Do you honestly think the transaction volume is going to increase by more than 60% over the next 12 months? How much has it increased over the past 12 months?
The rest of what you said is irrelevant.
I want to close this out.  The problem is the hard-fork isn't required right now.  If a hard-fork WAS required, which has happened in the past, it would happen as quickly as needed.  In the mean-time, it is better to spend the time fixing actual problems with bitcoin, rather than listening to chicken-littles constantly telling you that the sky is falling, when it is demonstrably not.

Not really.


The arguments are already understood.  You're the one just not accepting the outcome.


Yep.  So when you say :


I point out that if there were a crisis, these people have experience already in addressing one.


Actually it isn't.  The bitcoin blockchain isn't going to be good enough to handle even close to the type of transactions something like visa does.  Not ever.  It is simply not capable of doing it.  If you don't know that, you don't really understand the issue.
But right now, it doesn't need to either.  By the time transaction requirements reach a point where fees are an actual issue (and 4c isn't) I'm expecting the LN to shoulder the load of these micro-transactions.  The methodical changes in code are allowing that architecture to be implemented, and a true scaleable solution to be built around it.
So in spite of people who really don't know what they're talking about blathering on about block-size increases, we're going to get a better, cheaper, more reliable, and something I'm particularly interested in, more anonymous solution to exchanging bitcoin.  When it is required.  Which isn't now.
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:17:11


The operative word.  More importantly, it's a hard-fork.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:18:59
The risks are taken by the people who don't run their nodes to validate their transactions, to ensure that they are being paid in bitcoin.  Miners can mine shitcoins if they like, they just won't get bitcoin for it.  That's because nodes define and police consensus in bitcoin, not miners.  And if miners want to get paid, they mine according to bitcoin consensus rules, or they don't get paid in bitcoin.  Personally, I think it would be neat watching them go out of business.  But they won't.  Because they'll end up doing as they're fucking told.

If bitcoin doesn't meet their use-case, they should find things that do.  I'm happy with the gains that bitcoin has made this year.  I'm happy with the 30% increase in value in the last 30 days.
If you don't like bitcoin, don't use it.  The actual node owners of bitcoin don't want the reduced security that was put forth by an alternate group of CEO's and miners.  If you want to align yourself with those CEO's and miners, you are free to do so.  Go.  Be free.

@_date: 2016-02-23 07:16:17
You missed the most important part.


Increasing centralization, which bigger blocks right now would do, is bad for bitcoin, because it opens the protocol up to already known and understood attack vectors.  Bad idea.  And not only that, right now, not required, especially if it requires a hard-fork which presents even more dangers.
@_date: 2016-02-23 01:32:28


But it is a strictly technical argument.  There are more important things to work on than things that aren't needed, and might not be required.  And if they are required, there might be better solutions closer to the requirement.
So I ask you... do you have any logical proof that transaction volume is going to increase by 60% over the next 12 months?  I mean seriously?  That's what segwit has given... 60% more capacity.  If you can't come up with that justification, why are you pushing for a change to code that isn't necessary?  
@_date: 2016-02-23 07:55:42

They aren't aligned (Core vs Coinbase), clearly, and one set of interests (Cores) are transparently aligned with bitcoin.  Coinbase has only one set of interests, and that is to their shareholders.

Actually, it's not that problem per se, but the fact that a larger block has more bandwidth required.  Bandwidth doesn't scale like computer hardware, so as the bandwidth increases, smaller players are pushed much quicker to the margins.

Higher bitcoin transaction fees costs Coinbase more.  Larger blocks are desired by this group, because they want to increase transactions per block, and limit transaction fees.  So :






They still need to clear on-chain, for money that goes out of their system.  They just would conceivably want to pay less for that to occur.

The use-case of coffee is no use-case.  It never was, and it never will be.  In no world is it sensible or appropriate to store a micro-transaction such as this for the entire life of the system.  I've seen your posts.  How about you think of the environmental effect of such stupidity?


By that same logic, every single IP transaction that everyone ever did to the internet should be stored from the very beginning, until the end of time.  Ridiculous.


BS.  It isn't now, nor will it ever be, a solution to coffee sales.  Not then.  Not now.  Not ever.  Bitcoin adoption is not predicated on this, nor will it ever be.  Not then.  Not now.  Not ever.  If and when a solution comes along that doesn't require saving your coffee purchases for ALL TIME, go for your life.  The lightning network promises this type of functionality, and I'm all for it.  Until then, suck-it-up, because those juvenile high-deas about how to build a payment network are the things that are causing more of a crisis than the architecture of the system.
Until that time, you and people like you are just going to have to accept that you don't understand the problem of centralization, you don't understand the problem of propagation, and you don't understand that these transaction will be stored forever in the block-chain.
And more to the point, you might as well accept it.  Because it's going to happen this way.

We are going to get to the place where those types of purchases can be made, but we're not there yet.  People might try and use bitcoin for them,  but until they recognize the actual cost of a transaction, which is subsidized by the block-reward, they better not get used to it.  This is not going to change.
I have full confidence that we will be able to do any type of purchase when those micro-transactions are abstracted away.  Until that time, we have other problems that need to be addressed, and we're addressing them.  Creating a fee-market is one of them.  Addressing centralization is another.  Ensuring your coffee purchases can be traced to the block-chain forever isn't.  In its current iteration, as I demonstrated above, it never will be, and there's nothing you can do to the block-chain (like increasing a block-size) to change that reality.
@_date: 2016-02-23 02:24:04

I don't think so.  I believe that there is an expiration date on all bitcoin transactions, and when that expiration is hit, it's committed to the block-chain regardless.
The thing that I think most people don't understand is that I can't see this happening without you, the user, committing to opening a channel using bitcoin.  Channels will communicate with one another, but everyone will require an open one to use the LN.  I think the only way this can be achieved is that anyone who opens a channel will require using their own funds, and commit them to the channel until its expiration.  
@_date: 2016-02-23 11:02:49


I'm pretty pragmatic.  Company reps will represent their company's interests.  I would have more of a problem for them if they didn't.  I don't think of them any worse than anyone else.  I just don't think, just because they're running a bitcoin company, that they should be treated as if they're something that they're not.
We have a good path.  There are things that need to be solved, but they're being solved.  Some of those things might need to be re-prioritized.  That might, at some point, involve a hard-fork and a block-size increase.  There is no urgency in this, regardless of the rhetoric.  I question people who constantly regurgitate the rhetoric.  
It just plain isn't needed.  Not yet.  Maybe never.  We'll see.
@_date: 2016-02-23 08:25:36


It doesn't seem like it.


That's a little bit more than just the storage efficiency.  I would be saying that that is, in fact, the thing that needed to happen in order to get LN to work.  So it solves three very large problems (malleability attacks, scripting, storage efficiency) and was required for a further efficiency in the LN.  
I'd like more solutions like that from the core team thankyou.  Rather than wasting time addressing chicken-little requirements to things that aren't even problems yet.

In the end, Mr Armstrong represents his shareholders, creditors, and investors interests.  Any cost increase to him is a shareholder loss.  We are not privy to why he chooses certain positions, and why should we be?  He's got a fiduciary duty, and good luck to him.  
We can only rely on that fact.  We can't rely upon him representing anything other than his interests, and the interests of his shareholders.  Whether those things are aligned with bitcoin interests is a moot point.  It's impossible to know, and you are simply never going to find out.  The only thing that has happened in this specific discussion is that I can see how he would align more with larger mining conglomerates.
I'll rely upon people representing interests that are directly aligned with mine.  My interests lie in a safe and orderly development process that especially doesn't respond to chicken-little alarmist claims.

More transactions means more network communications, more storage, and more energy.  At every level.  Every time a block is created, more data has to be replicated to all miners and nodes.  Every new miner and node needs to replicate the entire growing chain.  And those transactions stay there forever, growing.
@_date: 2016-02-28 00:51:55
Your numbers are out by a factor of 10.  Standard transaction price is about
0.12 mBTC, which equates to 5c usd.  For that, you have a 99.9% chance of having the transaction in the next block.   You also have a 99.9999% chance of being within two blocks, and a 99.9999999% chance within three.  Literally one in one billion chance of it not making it on to the chain.

Segwit deals with efficiency in storage, and solves a problem right now.  There are other things that need to be sorted out right now, and larger blocks isn't one of them.

True.  There's an agreement to look at it, and even perhaps to provide it as an option.  Doesn't mean it's going to happen yet though.
I see fees pushing up to 10c for txns to get onto the chain.  If you put lower than that, you're shit outta luck.  But you also have the option of RBF and pushing it along.  Segwit is going to provide a capacity boost that will alleviate some of the load, but its deployment is going to align with transaction volume increases over the next 4-12 months.
I think the end-game is for the load of these small transactions to be pushed to the LN.  You'll be able to 'open a channel' that you can put 10/20/50/100 transactions in, and when it is closed, you pay the txn fee when it is transcribed to the block-chain.  It's a truly scaleable solution, so I can see why they want it.
If there's an actual crisis, we might see a hard-fork block size increase in six months or so.  I reckon the chance of that is about 50/50.

Between now and 2040 there will be about 11 halvings.   So the fees need to increase such that they occupy 10% more at each halvening.  Id prefer that increase to be linear, or as close as you can get to it.  So unless we do something about it now, which we are, we are simply going to require larger fee increases at some point in the future.

You really don't have a clue, do you?
The blockchain can handle 3 transactions per second.  That might expand to 5-6 with SegWit.  If you double the block-size, hell, you get upwards of 10!  woohoo!  So let's go ALL OUT!!!   Ignoring the reality of breaking bitcoin because you do it, let's say you increase the block size to 1gb, or 1000 times as large as today.  That's going to give you a max of 5000 transactions per second, or about 400 million transactions a day.  Bonza.  Even at this point, it could handle one tenth of the throughput of visa.  There are only a couple of computers in the world that would be able to handle it (if at all), but let's not let reality get in the way of your use-case of hard done-by venezuelan coffee aficionados!
Americans alone [consume 400 million cups of coffee a day](  That's just america.  That means, even if you increased the blocks size by ONE THOUSAND TIMES, you STILL wouldn't be able to store the transactions of a standard day of coffee drinkers in america.  The blockchain shouldn't be storing the transaction details of every coffee purchase in the world forever.  It can't do it.  It never could do it.  It won't ever do it.
So how about you just exit stage-left on this particular debate, because quite frankly, people with no clue like you should be skilling themselves up a bit more before they start opining.

As someone else notes, it's about timing.  The core camp says "there are other things to focus on now, and we'll revisit it when these other things makes an implementation like that safer".  The other camp says "halp! halp!  the sky is falling, the sky is falling!  we need big blocks now!"  
So sure, they might end up aligned, but the chicken littles aren't the ones defining the development cycle.  It might be implemented, or some other better tech might be implemented, closer to the time it is actually required, if ever.

The truth is, I don't know how this use-case is handled.

It would be discarded each time a transaction changes.  But I don't know the specifics.  Guess I'll find out.

I'm not sure about that.  My understanding is that a channel is opened using a set amount of BTC, but has an expiration date.  I think that's why that smart-contract expiration date was put in.
It's really neither here nor there, as the final 'closing of the channel' gets committed to the blockchain in a single transaction, but I don't think it hangs around in the mempool for the life of the channel.

@_date: 2016-02-23 06:47:20
No, not smart, because fee for transaction goes down, so you've kicked the can down the road to when it will be a much larger problem.  So you do this all, while at the same time centralizing mining and nodes even further, which expands the risk of already known attack vectors.  All because of chicken-littles saying the sky is falling, when it is demonstrably not true.

I certainly would include them.  I think the biggest game changer in the short to medium term is lightning.  But that has to be done with a level of control now in bitcoin that doesn't exist as much for other cryptos.  I think the lesson of the DAO is about the only one bitcoin will ever need not to rush the implementation of a service.  But bitcoin has the advantage of having so many developers.
 As a comparison of apples with apples, monero doesn't even have a light wallet yet. It doesn't make it any less effective at what it delivers, but it's important to understand what each solution delivers.  Creating another coin that just has a different branding than bitcoin, but without the development depth, it's always going to be difficult to differentiate your offering.

It might do it, who can say?  I agree that there will be debate whichever decision.  I think bitcoin is the only solution that has the possibility of introducing these types of features, because it already has a lot of uptake and financial system integration.
Bitcoin right now offers something that monero doesn't, and that's real liquidity and value storage.  Also, with bitcoin you can provably state your reserves, which is something that is probably never going to exist with monero.  The network effect of these things is going to be hard to dislodge.  Monero will have a tough time getting direct access to fiat payment systems for the foreseeable future.  But what Monero does do, it does well.
For at least the medium term, I reckon we've got both.  I'm not sure there's anything really wrong with that either.

So if you aren't here to "educate" and it's no use anyway, why are you here?  Or is it that you just can't help not being a whiny little bitch?

You can put your resources wherever you think it is important.  Other people will put their resources where they think it is important. 
Where those actual resources used to build bitcoin are is where the people who are actually doing things.    This tells you where the people who are actually willing and capable of building bitcoin actually identify as important.  Basically, put up or shut up. If you aren't going to help, either sit back on the train, or get off.  That is the only input you have to this conversation.

There are two articles there.  The first says that it is no longer maintained, and that it 'may' not be secure, which at some point in the future, may be true.  But right now, that's exactly what it is.
As for the second, it's important to understand the limitations of an operating system, and whether you should be ascribing those limitations to the tools that are being run on it.  Some operating systems have faulty things like random number generators.   There are flaws on some windows OS's that, under very specific conditions, can lead to a repeatable and crackable flaw in a volume that you create.  
I haven't seen any bug that has been shown to crack TC when using strong password management, and control of your OS.
And frankly, I'm not sure I trust the new implementations.  At least yet.

@_date: 2016-09-14 11:08:11


Hey, I love hearing about people contributing in any way they can.  My point, however, is that the upload bandwidth requirements are an issue because for most normal ADSL connections, that requirement is already close to the bandwidth available.  It works now, but if the bandwidth requirement were to double to triple, a significant number of people now running nodes would no longer be able to.
I'd love to see that requirement come down, and it's good that you're contributing to efforts like that, but I want to make sure that the requirements at least not hit that threshold, so that nodes can be maintained and the network health can be assured because of it.  This requirement, and the very act of doing an unnecessary hard-fork, are the things that are of greatest concern to me.  For the most part, people who use computers use a very small proportion of their CPU processing power.

- Oh.  You want me to include the oranges?  
- No, I want you to count the apples.  I'm making apple pie, and the pie will be ruined if I use oranges instead of apples.
- But the oranges are fruit too, why don't you want me to count them?
- Because they aren't apples.  I want to know how many apples there are, because I'm making apple pie.
- But oranges are sort of spherical too, so I should probably include them, right?
- No.  I just want you to count the apples.  The only thing I need in order to make apple pie are apples.  Not oranges.
- Right.  So I'll just count the apples with the oranges.

It's my expectation that cross-chain atomic swaps will play a part in any future PoW change.  That's why I'm really paying attention to how this will be built out in lightning first and litecoin atomic swaps second.
I just don't see the justification right now for the PoW change.  Bitmain likely has &gt;50% of hashing now.  As long as they don't attack the SHA256 algorithm and start  trying to censor transactions, i think that will continue.  I just hope the lightning/ cross-chain tech is built out if it is required.

No it wasn't.   Let's look at the 19th century as an example :
- Danish state bankruptcy of 1813
- Post-Napoleonic depression (post 1815)
- Panic of 1819, a U.S. recession with bank failures; culmination of U.S.'s first boom-to-bust economic cycle
- Panic of 1825, a pervasive British recession in which many banks failed, nearly including the Bank of England
- Panic of 1837, a U.S. recession with bank failures, followed by a 5-year depression
- Panic of 1847, started as a collapse of British financial markets associated with the end of the 1840s railway industry boom
- Panic of 1857, a U.S. recession with bank failures
- Panic of 1866, was an international financial downturn that accompanied the failure of Overend, Gurney and Company in London
- Long Depression (1873–1896)
- - Panic of 1873, a US recession with bank failures, followed by a four-year depression
- - Panic of 1884
- - Panic of 1890
- - Panic of 1893, a US recession with bank failures
- - Australian banking crisis of 1893
- - Panic of 1896

I'm not sure what you're saying.  A listening node is simply a node that will accept transactions directly from non-nodes.  There is another variant called a blocks only node that only validates blocks.   That variant aside, all nodes, listening or not, relay transactions to other's mempools that meet consensus, whether they are listening or not.  And blocks of course.   You can (and should) place your own transactions directly into your own mempool, and if they have an accepted fee, they will be included in the blockchain, whether you are a listening node or not.

 people needed to financially commit to having internet through an ISP, and acquiring the (expensive) hardware.   there was a time when people saw no use for owning a computer.  The internet, and specifically the web, changed that.  it is very comparable, and the pitfalls technically back then were not for the faint of heart.  And there was no Google to ask, or phone you could use to find something out if comms wasn't working.

It is a collective state of fear, mixed with jealousy.  If the fear wasn't there, they wouldn't be in a bitcoin subreddit desperately trying to convince you that bitcoin can't work.  They are paralyzed by not having the understanding of the technology, and more importantly the game theory, and because of this can't grasp why it is doing exactly what it was designed to do. 
But you don't owe them.  It doesn't matter what they think, you think, nor what i think.  Not individually.  It relies on simple human nature. The only thing bitcoin needs to do is survive.  The rest will take care of itself.

Completely false. Nodes define the connection with the blockchain which they house.  They can create a patch that has a pointer to their copy of the blockchain which requires a different pow to get bitcoin rewards.  If the nodes choose a different pow, that's the end of the story.  Which they will if bitmain ever tries to censor bitcoin transactions by orphaning blocks with blacklisted transactions.

It's not what I want, it's what I think will work.  I'd like a complete root and branch analysis as to what the total tax take *should* be for all of the citizens of a country, and then construct the tax system around that requirement.  When I say 'what it should be' I mean what it should be for total, your entire life.  How much of a debt do you owe to the society that you live in to ensure it is a harmonious place to live.
Reckon there are only three types of taxes that will work when private decentralized money exists as a pervasive store of value.  They are :
1. Sales Tax (i.e. GST/VAT)
2. Property Tax.
3. Estate Tax. (i.e. death tax)
By regulating sales (i.e. cash registers) which is mostly done now anyway, and regulating property transfers which is done now anyway, and regulating dying, which you can't really hide, you can build a tax system around something you can do, not around something you think other people should do.  When you buy something at a store, you pay the state its share.  When you buy a house or apartment, you pay the state its share.  When you die, your assets are reviewed, and you pay the state its share from the remaining assets.
Because those are the only ones that will work, the question becomes, what percentage of tax should be sourced from each of these options, and what the total amount people should pay is?  20%?  25%?  30%?  I'm talking the total amount of money you earn in your lifetime, how much goes to the state to support the society that you live in?
What I would *like* to see is a right to financial freedom.  Your money is yours.  Your privacy is yours.  This should be a right like the right to free speech.  It is the exchanges of money between people that is taxed, because it is the change in ownership in the eyes of the state that is recorded.  But inherent in that 'right' is that, once you're dead, you're dead, and that right no longer exists.  Dead people don't have the right to financial freedom.  You don't have a right to privacy when you're dead, and your assets are divided amongst your inheritances and the state, after your death.

For the record, my goal, if i were to have one with regards to bitcoin education, would be to discourage its use until you understand how and why it works.  No one should invest money in things they don't understand. If you aren't prepared to do that, a world of pain could await you.  
You can lose everything in bitcoin because of a single fat fingered fuckup, if you don't take precautions.  Bitcoin isn't going anywhere, so there is no rush.  Learn how to do it right, or don't do it at all.  You are just as likely to receive bad advice as good advice on the internet, so the only real solution is to learn enough about the technology that you can seek the technical answers to questions, and understand that for yourself.  That is hard and time consuming, but there really aren't any shortcuts.

Including a 1tb hard drive?  
The cheapest I've really seen a pi, without the connectors, is really about $50, and usually that's on special.  With the connectors and the case, that's generally an extra $10-$20 (or more).  Then there's the SIM for the pi.  You'd have to probably make sure it's a pretty good power supply if you are powering the hd from the usb, woudn't you?  Assuming you pay $50 for the HD, that's still $120-$130 yes?  And usually a bit more?  Assuming you already had a screen, keyboard, mouse, and any cabling you need to configure it?
I remember learning this process, because I love these little pi tthings, so if you haven't done it before, there are a few assumptions you need to recognize?

"Pay off debt"  doesn't mean the same thing in Japan.  The 'problem' is that they are [a nation of savers]( with a government that has for decades tried desperately to get them to part with their savings.  Stimulus after stimulus after stimulus.  So the savers have been punished for decades.  The only real effect this has had is discourage people from having expensive children.   
What bitcoin allows the Japanese to do is circumvent that debasement, and in the process, stimulate the economy, because their savings will appreciate faster than the rest of the world.  It's no real surprise to me that the Japanese public are formalizing this process at a national level faster than anywhere else.

That works out roughly to 1 million US Dollars a day throughput so far.  Without expanding, if it keeps at this pace, that's 350 million a year.  For a brand new exchange, that's a lot.  If that traffic increases, that starts becoming a market-player in its own right.

What it's basically saying is, if you install this software, you can get MORE control of your OS and use it to do nefarious things.  That's the bug.

The gdp is the productive capacity.  The economy is much larger than that one statistic.   Total residential and commercial real estate is estimated to be 500 trillion.   Derivatives, which is the expected returns on the economy over some nebulous length of time is about 4 quadrillion. 
The problem is the cost of real estate, fueled by people taking on more debt feeds that gdp.  Has production increased?  Nope.  But gdp has.  Which means gdp has been perverted into a combination of productive capacity and debt expansion.  Until that is resolved we will continue to have these crashes.  That's why bitcoin.

Funnily enough, it was in 2014 when I finally got bitcoin.  I bought 'the dip' at 400, 75% or so down from its ATH.  It then proceeded to halve again, and then some, down to $185.  It didn't hit that 400, 75% down, for another 18 months.  It didn't hit the ATH again for about three and a half years.

Instead we get statements based upon nebulous and incomplete understandings, that are announced as facts.  They need to be a whole lot less certain in their statements.

If if if.  There will be attacks for which you are unaware.  Every action that you know that has an unresolved vector is an exposure for which you are not prepared.  The only surefire way to protect yourself in crypto is to use your own node, behind TOR, preferably behind a VPN as well.  Only from that framework can you ultimately lessen (but never completely extinguish) risk. 
The first thing you need to do to mitigate risk is to neutralize known vectors of attack.  Using someone else's node will always expose you to an attack vector.

If you're not running for own node, you're not using bitcoin : peer-to-peer cash.  Because if you're not running a node, you're not a peer.  You are not an equal.  You require someone else's node infrastructure to access the bitcoin network.  You have inserted a trust requirement into a trustless protocol.  
You think understanding bitcoin and making it work as intended is a cult.  I think you're just not that smart, or you're lazy, and so much so that you think your betters (objectively.  Not a peer, remember?) need to denigrated, in order for you to feel good about your own inadequacies.

Don't you think it is strange that you have invested so much of your time, and yet you still haven't even grasped why it works?   It is the greatest financial technology since the [Medici family/bank]( implemented double entry bookkeeping over 500 years ago.

Like banking, it feeds on peoples insecurity with money and therefore their futures.

Just be aware that those numbers must always be viewed with caution.  That number is just listening nodes, as some other poster said, being a small subset of actual full nodes.  But most importantly, that number doesn't tell you how many are being used for making and receiving bitcoin transactions, because it's not possible to know that ratio.  It is only the use of the node that contributes to bitcoin security, and everyone needs to caution themselves about a false sense of security with a number.  It's great that it's higher, but it is still possible that security is lower.
Run your node.  Use your node.  When enough people do that, bitcoin is secure.

No, because the signing device never connects to a network.  You physically copy an unsigned transaction as a text file from the network connected computer, to the air-gapped one, open electrum that has your passwords, sign the transaction, copy the signed version to a usb, go back to the network one, load electrum, and broadcast it from there.  A hardware wallet is still connecting to your network connected computer.  It could be doing anything.

Because it allows for truly private transactions, and at the micro-bitcoin level, with vanishingly small fees.


Yes.  The settlement process would definitely have to be redesigned.  The plus side is that the exchange would be more secure, and instantaneous, which is never the case for any blockchain transaction.  That still needs to be confirmed in a block.

Bitcoin, and the framework that led to it being required and developed, is complex.  Very few people actually understand how money works.  That is not likely to change quickly, if ever.  The base in bitcoin is the people that understand and want to enable their own financial sovereignty, and do it with a technological solution. 
It used to be a very small number of people.  10 years ago it was vanishingly small.  That group of people has grown over time.  The people who use nodes to secure their bitcoin.  Along with them have come the shysters and charlatans. They've hyped up crypto to be more than the people who want financial sovereignty have ever cared about. 
Then the hype bursts, but that original group is double its size.  And then it doubled again. It's still tiny.  Probably justifying $250 a coin.  And then a new set of hype merchants try to separate you from your bitcoin.  And then the bitcoin hodlers double again.  All the while these people say you need protect your bitcoin.  Secure your keys. Every time the hype bursts, a new set of salty scammers abandon crypto. 
The actual value in bitcoin, and crypto, is tiny.  These market caps mean nothing.  I suspect that a single one billion dollar buy of bitcoin would double its price at least, and that metric is even more pronounced in alts.  The only people that really matter, as far as i'm concerned, is the hodlers in bitcoin.  They provide the floor in all crypto.  Anything other than bitcoin is mostly a distraction.

Not accept a payment from someone who was using that chain.  They are trying to cheat you.  The point of having the chain is ensuring you can do this.

What assumption?  I don't think you understand how this works.  The fact that you have a chain that meets consensus and is longer than one that meets consensus and is shorter, OR doesn't meet consensus, defines it's validity.  You don't search back, you work forward from genesis to current.  As long as every block gets added onto the previous block meeting consensus, and no-one has an alternate block that meets consensus and is longer, the block you have, by definition, is valid.  That's what this process is :  Validation of every transaction and block.  Everyone agreeing that the current block meets the consensus requirements and is the longest chain is what consensus means in bitcoin.

You base your opinion on a survey?  Here, let's do the math :  
How much money is there in the world.


But who owns that cash eh?


That's just america.  Assuming american broadly makes up for roughly 25% of the world economy, that would make 10 trillion in cash held by *publicly listed* (and only publicly listed) companies.  
How much of that cash is kept as country reserves?


or 10.7 trillion.
What is the total value of *publicly listed* companies in the world?


So how about bonds, eh?


So what we have is about 70T (companies) owning 10T of 70T (80T currency - 10T reserves).  Which means publicly listed companies in just the major economies of the world is a larger asset class than ALL of the remaining cash in the world.  Add the bond market of 80T means that all publicly listed assets + all bonds = roughly 150T (70T + 80T) vs 60T being ALL remaining cash.
And I haven't even started on derivatives, which means I haven't even included commodities.  Nor have I even included privately held property ([217T](  Who do you think owns all these things, eh?  So what your survey showed, is they ask a bunch of numpties where their savings are, instead of asking people who actually save where their savings are.  Oh, and by the way, also surveying numpties in order to instill a sense of fear, to sell a product of... wait for it... investing.  Which not so coincidentally, they think you're not doing enough of.  Because if that assertion is correct, who the hell owns all of the companies, eh?  People, that's who.
**These are only broad numbers, but they are there to make a point.**  The cash holdings of people, ALL people, is tiny.  It is a fraction of the total number of assets in the world.
And newsflash, the derivatives market, which forms the basis for pensions for most of the world, being the *future earnings* of those assets, is greater than that.  Broadly estimated at 1.2 quadrillion the last time I looked (a few minutes ago).

Best instructions there are IMO.  Short of using a node directly, it is the best security available. 
Load the keys in an airgapped computer.  Create watch only wallets.  Use electrum on a network computer.  Load watch only wallets.   Create transactions and sign transactions on airgapped computer.   broadcast on network one.  A vm works fine.  Virtualbox is open source and free.  A pi will work just fine.  Transfer transaction text files between computers on usbs.
This technique will work equally well with electron cash.

There's a method to my madness. I've long believed that only a fraction of the people involved in bitcoin know how or why it works. But once someone actually does learn it, there's an "a-ha" moment, and you never look at it in the same way.
That cohort is continually increasing, and that is the floor in the bitcoin price. When someone really does understand how the consensus model works, they progress to node security, and most never want to ever exchange their bitcoin for fiat. They do it because they have to. They might exchange it for a thing, but not just for weak money.
As long as more and more people really understand how bitcoin works, that number will grow organically.

I'm sorry.  I thought I was talking to [someone else](  Mixed up thread.  Guy insinuates I'm a cultist because I want to run a node, and I thought this was extension of that discussion.  Apologies.
But as to the subject at hand.  By choosing generic devices that never had a specific purpose, and never get used again for another purpose after their usage, you can reasonably be sure that their security isn't breached.  In the case of a device that is specifically designed for managing keys, and signing bitcoin transactions, by compromising the production of that device, or even the firmware upgrade of that device, you are far more likely to be directly targeted.
I'm thinking of it in the ways that i would attack it from the perspective of the state.  I actually expect that this will eventually happen, although years and maybe even decades in the future.  I simply don't trust devices for the reasons I've stated.

Decisions decisions... do i upgrade my node to ensure I'm still using bitcoin, or do i do the unsafe thing and see all of my money stolen by attacking miners using a now obsolete hashing algorithm?
The obvious thing, of course, is that miners already know this stuff.  You're the one who doesn't.  You have no idea how any of this stuff works dude.   You should quit while you're only this far behind.

Completely false.  Nodes define and police consensus in bitcoin, not miners.  It makes no difference how much hash power exists if the nodes don't accept their blocks.
You're just like that other numpty.  You still can't figure out why 2x failed.  They failed because the nodes define and police consensus in bitcoin, and when the miners tried to tell the nodes what to do, the nodes told them to get fucked, and they all fell into line like good little servants.

If you don't understand the tech, or the theory behind why it is important, and don't want to, don't invest in it.  Simple. 
Bitcoin does not require FOMO.  It isn't going anywhere.  Learn how to use it.  It's a fascinating tech for so many reasons.  People 50 years ago were introduced to credit cards.  They were revolutionary, but they took many many years before they were truly integrated into consumer behavior.  Smart phones took 10?  It's anyone's guess when crypto is going to be in that mix, but if you think it isn't, you're kidding yourself.

One thing i think the mtgox dump has done though, is increase liquidity in the market.  I expect this will have the effect of increasing volatility in the market for the short to medium term.  Lots of big swings coming up. 
What it has also shown is how tiny the market of cryptos actually is.  400 million has caused this reduction in cap of 200 billion or so.  Even if it is one of many factors, I still think will have had a major effect.  100 billion?  50 billion?  That, to me, tells just exactly how much a small move in of capital will have on the price.  People who tell you that banks are already piling in it are kidding themselves.

I wish there was such a thing. Not necessarily the capitalist part, but the free-market part.  But they don't really exist either.  Unbounded capitalism is no different than the master/slave and king/serf dynamic, you just substitute employer/employee.  The surplus of your work is transferred to the owner.
Owners don't like competition, so they crush it.  The most powerful wins.  Which is why 'free' and 'capitalist' don't really exist together.  In order to understand that, you have to understand what the word 'free' even means.  You've spent a lot of time on the word 'capitalist' (without really understanding it) but you have spent zero time on the word 'free'.

No they don't actually.  Most savings exist as retirement investments, shares, or bonds. 


Mostly selling houses, whose sole purpose is to sit and acquire capital growth through the acquisition of more debt to increase house prices further.   Which is why it now takes two incomes to raise children, where it used to take one, and home vacancies have never really been higher.


When people actually invest in things that employ people, they will be able to drive productivity growth, which increases returns greater than sitting on the capital.
Stop asserting that debt creation is growth.  It has been perverted for almost a century into what it is today.  People are now so fixated on growth, that they don't even know anymore how to separate debt creation from productivity increases.  A deflationary currency exposes that fault.

Yes it does.  When you use a light wallet to make a transaction you communicate directly with a node that someone has made available for you to use.   They could be doing this for no other reason than to track you.  That node knows exactly which ip address the txn comes from.  If you run a node, and you make transactions from that node, the txn enters the mempool of the node and is replicated to all other connected nodes without the ip address.  There is no identifier as to which node it originates from.   But the node still has it.  Only by running a node can you choose to ensure that this information is discarded.

 yep, that's about my take.  
I think the mtgox trustee sell off has highlighted some very telling metrics.  They sold off 400 million or so.  Let's assume the sell off band is somewhere between 250 mil and 1 billion.  That caused a drop in the market cap of a hundred billion.  That is tiny tiny tiny.  Let's be generous and say that that is a 1:100 ratio.   It also highlights for me the upside potential, and gives some indication as to how much capital it will take to influence the price.  The people who say banks are buying this stuff are kidding themselves. If they were, bitcoin would be orders of magnitude greater in market cap.

I reckon you're gonna be paying your dealer directly with lightning before you use it for e-commerce.  As a replacement for cash, in places where there is very very little cash, if the fees are what people expect them to be, and networks form organically, it is wild in its implications.  It is a way to transact without USD.  That's where I see lightning, and for many years, before there's wide-spread online acceptance.
CC's are just too convenient.  People use them even knowing the security problems.  They don't care.  LN will get its light wallet.  People are going to want to get paid with this stuff.  The tech will filter through to the actual users (millenials), and time will take care of everything else.

Just right off the bat, understand that this stuff is not easy to get your head around.  It took me over a year to really grasp consensus in bitcoin, and I've been using computers for almost 40 years. 
The only thing i can suggest is go to electrum.org and search for how you use cold storage.  The act of separating your keys from a network connected computer is what made me understand what was at stake. After that, i started looking in the network settings of electrum and thought "what are these things im connecting to? Who are they?" When you realize that those things you're connecting to might be adversarial, you investigate how to neutralize that risk.  And that is when you learn what a node does.

If you use someone else's nodes, they could be correlating addresses that you think are isolated.  This can be done simply by querying balances.  If you're not careful, IP address can be traced. 
In fact, i don't think this is an idle concern. I expect that it is already happening. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 04:22:42
My belief is that you should be connecting your hardware wallet to your own node.  Without running your own node, you are not sure you're using bitcoin, and you should expect that your transactions will be tracked.  With your own node, you neutralize that privacy leak, and get the full security of consensus with bitcoin. 
I would recommend the fine fork of electrum, electrum personal server, by to connect your hardware wallet to your own node.  
I don't use a hardware wallet myself.  I do this :

The only thing I'd add to your great explanation would be to point out something that people get in the abstract way, but not in practice.   That is : For every buyer that buys something at a price, there is a seller selling that thing at the same price.  When a trader has a "big buy/sell" there is an opposite side that is selling/buying.  There aren't more buyers than sellers, or sellers than buyers.  Value hasn't gone up or down, it has simply shifted between either side of the transaction

There's a method to my madness.  I've long believed that only a fraction of the people involved in bitcoin know how or why it works.  But once someone actually does learn it, there's an "a-ha" moment, and you never look at it in the same way. 
That cohort is continually increasing, and that is the floor in the bitcoin price. When someone really does understand how the consensus model works, they progress to node security, and most never want to ever exchange their bitcoin for fiat.  They do it because they have to.  They might exchange it for a thing, but not just for weak money. 
As long as more and more people really understand how bitcoin works, that number will grow organically.

Seriously though, I think the actual hodlers is somewhat below those numbers.  The 3200, IMO, is only about 1200 hodlers.  Today, I'd hazard a guess that hodl quotient is about 1800-2000.  It could even be much less than that, maybe even $1500.  But if your eye is even on that number alone, the growth is quite exceptional, and has been for many years.

I don't know man, I reckon that's pretty well spot-on.






I'd like to see how that assumption could be wrong.  I can't see it.  It is the way to punish the unsuccessful risk-takers, but also reward the successful ones.  All the risk right now is passed onto the savers, and their savings are hit when these risks blow-up.  This solves that problem.
This is a [1:10000 rule]( argument for me.  I think bitcoin will finally separate the good debt from the bad debt. It is my personal belief ( as in i don't know of any formal theory ) that debt should only be incurred for the use of building a productive asset.  The difference between investment and usury?  In a deflationary currency, this encourages businesses to ensure that productivity increases will have greater returns than savings. Instead, our financial system has encouraged the acquisition of debt for fixed assets. The only thing this has done is bid up the price of those fixed debts with debt, and handed over the money for supporting that system to banks and their owners. In order to stimulate growth in such a system, the only way that you can function is to tax savings. That's what inflation is.  What it forces people to do is to invest in increasingly risky assets, because of the loss of their purchasing power.  Hence bubble after bubble after bubble.  Crisis after crisis after crisis.
Bitcoin will eventually stabilize to an ever appreciating value asset. But what it will allow you to do is save for a house. If you have a business proposal that encourages people to pay you for a good or service, people will invest their savings in it and take on that risk.  Banks will instead move back to providing capital to businesses, using savings from people that are willing to invest.  Businesses will again focus on productivity increases, because that's how you get access to capital.
I also don't think it is going to be resisted quite as much as people think it will be. People still need to pay their taxes, and that is not going to stop. The main thing it is going to do is prick the bubble of consumer debt, and remove the banking middle-men from that space. That alone is a multi-trillion dollar industry, let alone the annuities that banks own and graft from, from those assets. Removing these people (i.e. banking debt suppliers) from positions of power, by strangling their access to capital, is a justification for bitcoin in its own right. Imagine a world in which banks didn't control governments. 
That's the way it is supposed to work i think.  It is pure genius.

They don't need to.  No changes have been made to bitcoin such that they are not still meeting consensus.  These are the real hodlers of bitcoin.  They're the ones that have been enforcing consensus for years.  They don't care bout the drama and the numpties.  As long as the nodes still meet the same consensus rules, they'll continue using the same node infrastructure that secured their wealth to begin with.
The only real reason most of them will ever upgrade their consensus rules will be if a miner attacks the SHA-256 chain.  For them, if it aint broke, don't fix it.

Blockchains can't exist without a defense mechanism, otherwise they can be trivially attacked.  So they are no better, in fact worse, than a regular database.  It is the token that is given as a reward for maintaining the health of the network.  Without that maintenance, there would be no security, and no need for a blockchain.

No dude.  


I would suggest less laughing?


That demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of what nodes do. 
Henceforth be thy lesson : 
So let's talk about nodes and consensus as defined in the whitepaper and implemented in nodes.
 Let's start with [the bitcoin white paper]( :


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




What does this mean if you are but an intrepid traveler amongst the erstwhile numpty-folk?
Nodes are agents in a multi-agent system with [an agreed set of consensus rules]( which they and they alone enforce, that ensure that the system functions. Transactions are propagated through the multi-agent network based upon the agreed consensus rules by nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Miners retrieve valid transactions from any of these nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then order the transactions, and perform a hashing function on them until the hashing function returns a value that is suitable to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then pass the new block that they've created to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. The nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, then validate the block to ensure that each of the transactions within the block agree with the consensus rules. Then the node, which is an agent in a multi-agent system, extends the block-chain by attaching the new block to it.  They then pass the new block, if it is valid, to other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Then each of these other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, each do the same validation on every block.
Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node extends the blockchain.  Miners don't.  The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.  It is the validation of the nodes, and their CPU's, that define and police consensus in bitcoin.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.  Miners work.  Nodes validate.  So nodes are the proof in proof-of-work. 
Nodes accept the transactions, validate the transactions (using their CPU), replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks (using their CPU), extend the blockchain (using their CPU), replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.  If you can't convince these node owners that are using their node on a day-to-day basis, to uninstall their node software and install your new node client, especially when that node client decreases their node security and decreases the network security, any change you have is going to go exactly nowhere.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.  If you can't convince all of those node owners running their node clients to uninstall one client and re-install another, any change you have to consensus is DOA.

I don't blame millennials for the shit sandwich that boomers gave them.  Xers grew up with the potential for nuclear annihilation but at least we didn't get drafted for wars.   The interesting part of that talk was the realization that the effect of Gen X is minimized as a raw statistic.  There are just less of us than both boomers and millennials.
I think the thing I read the other day about the Xers is most telling.  We were the last unsupervised generation.  Boomers grew up in houses with big families, and permanent people at home (at least as an ideal).  Millennials were given much less freedom than us Xers.  The things I did as a kid would be unthinkable with todays kids, and that includes millenials, my daughter being one of.
EDIT: I'd say they've had it harder.  Kids these days deal with stress much better than I did as a kid.

Social networks are centralized.  That's how they work.  Bringing people together.  Bitcoin is decentralized.  It can only grow at the speed of its least secure element, and it is growing extremely quickly. 
Bitcoin is growing at an exponential rate.  It doesn't need to happen, and can't happen, in two years.  Sit back, relax, and watch that meteoric exponential rise.  And watch each and every alt give up their decentralization ideals for quick bux, and the inevitable dump.  If the SEC doesn't close down 95% of them before they implode.

Ah the ol no intrinsic value meme. I use [the 1:10000 rule]( for this argument.  It is my opinion that the intrinsic value of bitcoin is far far greater than anyone really comprehends.  People generally are too focused on people just buying and selling the asset, but not about the cryptographic proof, and incentive structure that perpetuates the network functioning.  So when people like to ask what the intrinsic value of bitcoin is, I say :
You are thinking of the store of value property without the cryptographic property that secures it. You are talking about it as one would talk about valuable shells, and even shell sellers, and not the security that separates it from all forms of value exchange before it. To understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin it is good to use the analogy of an envelope. So i ask you : does an envelope have intrinsic value?
If I have a letter that I need to send securely, would I prefer to send it open, and ready to be read? Or would I prefer for it to be sent within the confines of an envelope? Now let's think... would I prefer to just leave an open envelope, or would I think it necessary to put some seal across it to ensure that it isn't opened, and read whilst en-route. Does a sealable envelope have more intrinsic value than an unsealable one? Hmm... but what if someone can counterfeit the seal? I need some method of ensuring that the message I want to get to that person isn't read, and preferably, isn't even identified as a message. That's when you need to get lawyers involved. Sounds expensive. There's obviously something intrinsically valuable about such a service, because many people pay oh-so-very-much money for it.
Now let's imagine we're not talking about letters, we're talking about money. Would you address a $100 note through the mail to your child for their birthday? You'd pay for a stamp at least. Would you encase it in an envelope that you paid for at the local post-shop? Hmm... bill in the envelope.  Anyone will be able to see that it is money. Perhaps encase it in a card? What if it is $1000? $10,000? $10 million?  Does the protection service of an envelope somehow decrease because the value of the contents of the package increases? It's the opposite, isn't it? Bitcoin is both the cryptographically sealed envelope, and the network to deliver it.
What say you? Is an envelope intrinsically valuable?

Yep.  More investors that 'oh noes it's crashing sell!!!'  'oh no, FOMO buy!'.  I don't think the lower band is going to be affected that much (which is anyones guess what it is), but the variation between the band I expect to hit its extremes more often.  This was supposed to lessen the higher the price of bitcoin got.  This just reset that.


Relative to any large financial asset of which there are certainly hundreds, and likely thousands. 


That's my point.  It is tiny tiny tiny.  This just proves that.

Bitcoin challenges the very concept of 'value'.  I don't have any idea what bitcoin is going to become, and i know a lot about it.  It isn't like any other financial instrument ever created.  Any person who tries to apply their labels to it shows only their reliance upon labels instead of validating their assumptions.  What happens if it doesn't stop?  Not over 5 years, but 25?
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:46:36
I'm saying that more people recognize its use-case today than one year ago.  I have no desire to see bitcoin become pervasive over the next two years.  What's the rush?  The infrastructure needs to be built out, which is exactly what is happening.  10 more years is fine thanks.  The last few have been pretty epic.

No.  And even if I did, it isn't my job to tell my friends how to spend their money.  I don't gamble, but a lot of my good friends do.  Gambling is a scam that is specifically meant to part people from their money.  Why aren't you trolling gambling forums?  It's certainly a much bigger industry?  My view is that they're adults, and if they want to spend their money that way, so be it.  They're not hurting me.  Don't you think people having the freedom to spend the fruits of their productive labor where they see fit something that we should strive for?


Sure.  It is because of that that bitcoin was invented.  To be able to take away the power of people who do the things you're talking about.  Why aren't you protesting against ExxonMobil?  Or any large car manufacturer for that matter.  Surely you recognize that the effects on the planet of these companies is far greater than anything bitcoin has to do with.  Don't you think it's just a little bit weird that you'll create sockpuppet accounts in order to troll a subreddit that you have no interest in?


Is that what you feel you're providing?  An informed decision?  Don't you think you'd need to at least understand the subject in order to be 'informed'?  You don't even know what the invention is, or indeed, why it works.  I recommend that no-one at all invest in bitcoin if they don't understand what its value proposition is, and more importantly, how it is going to be be realized.
But you're not doing that.  You're like a christian trolling an atheist subreddit, and calling everyone idiots because they don't believe in creationism.  You're not providing any insights into bitcoin.  You're certainly not helping anyone.  It sounds to me like you're trying to troll this subreddit in some bizarre belief that someone here is going to attempt to change your mind, *and you're not gonna let that happen goddamit*.  Why would I do that?  I don't care what you think.  Don't like bitcoin?  Don't invest in it.  It's not that hard of a concept to grasp.  No-one is holding a gun to your head.

Henceforth be thy lesson : 
So let's talk about nodes and consensus as defined in the whitepaper and implemented in nodes.
 Let's start with [the bitcoin white paper]( :


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




What does this mean if you are but an intrepid traveler amongst the erstwhile numpty-folk?
Nodes are agents in a multi-agent system with [an agreed set of consensus rules]( which they and they alone enforce, that ensure that the system functions. Transactions are propagated through the multi-agent network based upon the agreed consensus rules by nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Miners retrieve valid transactions from any of these nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then order the transactions, and perform a hashing function on them until the hashing function returns a value that is suitable to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then pass the new block that they've created to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. The nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, then validate the block to ensure that each of the transactions within the block agree with the consensus rules. Then the node, which is an agent in a multi-agent system, extends the block-chain by attaching the new block to it.  They then pass the new block, if it is valid, to other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Then each of these other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, each do the same validation on every block.
Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node extends the blockchain.  Miners don't.  The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.  It is the validation of the nodes, and their CPU's, that define and police consensus in bitcoin.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.  Miners work.  Nodes validate.  So nodes are the proof in proof-of-work. 
Nodes accept the transactions, validate the transactions (using their CPU), replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks (using their CPU), extend the blockchain (using their CPU), replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.  If you can't convince these node owners that are using their nodes on a day-to-day basis, to uninstall their node software and install your new node client, especially when that node client decreases their node security and decreases the network security, any change you have is going to go exactly nowhere.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.  If you can't convince all of those node owners running their node clients to uninstall one client and re-install another, any change you have to consensus is DOA.

The difference between hosted and non-hosted instances would be my guess.  But there's no real way of knowing that for sure.  A vpn could do that translation for you, in that if you were running from behind a vpn, there's no guarantee that the port that you're listening to is the one that is facing the outside world through the vpn.  If they're closed, they certainly wouldn't need to use a standard port.  In fact, if it isn't a listening node, it doesn't need to be either.
I'm not sure what real info it could provide, but I'm sure there are much better qualified people to answer.

What i got, and most people who comment on it like you don't have, is understanding the game theory behind the decentralization.  You think the technology is stringing transactions together.

Fees paid has nothing to do with the mining fee.  The only thing that would provide any information worth considering would be something like :
What is the minimum fee to make a transaction within one week over time?  But I'm not sure anyone would do that, because even that one week timeline is arbitrary.  Some people choose one week, some one hour, some one day.  
At some point we just have to accept the reality that the entire multi-year blocksize campaign was nothing more than an attack on the governance of bitcoin.  They lost.  It has taken months for them to acknowledge the severity of the 2x smack-down.  But now when the dust has settled, bitcoin is back doing what only it can do.

 The least offensive thing about em is how much money they are making.  Nodes control the protocol.  As long as they behave, they could make a lot more money.  Centralisation of mining is an issue, because they may try and censor transactions.  And then there would be an emergency hard-fork (with opt-in replay protection) to a different PoW and their value would disappear overnight.  They can mine bcash.   frankly, that's why i think they created it.  Risk management.  New PoW miners would think happy days. 
If they behave, the market will grow and other competitors will enter the market, and that centralisation will reduce.

Freedom is hard. Actually requiring probable cause before being subjected to the justice system used to be a thing. Then the US government started stealing peoples money without ever even charging them with a crime. So now we have crypto. So the government can't do it anymore. "But but but what if they are committing a crime!" they say. Prove it i say. You know. Rule of law. That's what democracies are supposed to be about aren't they?
And that attack on freedom now has crypto as a response. The thing that it is counter-intuitive about crypto, is that the solution to electronic anonymous and censorship resistant money, turned out being record everything forever. When someone can flick a switch and take everything from you, you don't have freedom. When you can access the ledger from anyone, prove that it it is valid, and be able to send your money to anyone, for whatever purpose, you do.
This technology has been developed as a direct response to the insidious and anti-democratic implementation of AML/KYC laws on a global scale over the past 30 years. The extrapolation of these laws, given a long enough timeline, is slavery. Not figurative slavery, actual slavery.
Bitcoin is the technical response to that problem.  That's the value proposition.

I don't subscribe to this ludicrous premise that some kids around here have about tax.  Personally i don't like living in a shit-hole, and I've lived in shit-holes that exist as a result of ineffective taxation. 
But there is something that governments are going to have to come to grips with eventually, and that is that crypto is going to permanently allow the hiding of capital gains.   Indeed, savings.  Long term i think there's gonna be a fundamental realignment of taxation.  I expect the only viable taxes in this framework are sales, property, and estate (i.e. death) taxes.  I can't see any other system that will work. I expect them to go up, and all other taxes to disappear.

The problem is, you think your opinion is valuable, simply because you have one, in a subject for which you know very little.  What you don't understand is that there is a difference between an opinion and a substantiated opinion.  You have the former.
What you should be doing is learning the subject first, and then forming an opinion, rather than taking an already established opinion, and then highlighting the fact that it doesn't have any substantiation.

That's exactly what I'm saying.  
People regularly don't know the difference between a law and a right.  Rights are things that governments can't take from you.  A right to be presumed innocent.  A right to reject self-incrimination.  A right to privacy.  A right to know what you are being accused of, and the evidence that is to be used against you in an impartial court of law, where the complainant, the state, must prove beyond reasonable doubt that you have committed a specific crime.
I break no law, and I don't have to explain myself.  I pay my taxes, and am a good citizen.  You have to gather evidence, lawfully, while also respecting my right to privacy.  That's the law.  You should learn it.  You don't get to put me under surveillance just because I might commit a crime.  You have to provide probable cause, and that requires you having existing evidence that I have committed a specific crime.  I don't have to explain how much bitcoin I have to anyone, and nothing I'm doing is even remotely illegal.

You cannot separate these issues.  It's like saying "Assuming electricity is free, everyone has tera-bit internet connections, and 500tb hard-drives, do you think big blocks are better?"

Nope.  I understand the handshake method of establishing a connection using a listening node, assuming you don't already have a node list to connect to, but once that connection is established, blocks will be sourced from non-listening nodes just the same as listening ones.  If what you said was true, non-listening nodes would never have traffic going out from them.


Nope.  Just because you can't reliably get a number, doesn't make another number important.  The only number that's important is the number of nodes used to make bitcoin transactions.  Just because you can't find that number, by design, doesn't mean you get to point at another number and somehow use that as a proxy for the thing you don't have access to.

Just be aware that electrum uses the newer bech32 address format for segwit, whereas samouri uses the older script one.   many wallets don't support sending to bech32 addresses yet.  Sending from the wallet is no problem, but sending to it requires a client that can recognize the format.  As more wallets support segwit, this will change, but good to know now. Electrum segwit addresses start with bc1, and samouri segwit addresses start with 3.  You can send to a samouri segwit wallet from any wallet.

lol.  See how quickly your logic falls down?  Yes.  It is.  No ifs and buts about it.  You can query it just like you do a database.
The reason why a bitcoin blockchain is the way it is, is because of its consensus model and proof-of-work.  It is a chain, because the length of that chain, when it meets consensus, defines it as *the* blockchain.  You can query any non-consensus version of the data you like, but if it doesn't meet consensus, as defined by the decentralized nodes of bitcoin, it is just a corrupt database.
It is the proof-of-work extension of the chain that defines its validity, not just some numpty creating hashes of transactions and appending them to a list.  It is those transactions *that have been hashed according to a proof-of-work algorithm* that define it as a block added to a blockchain.  And if you can't guarantee that there is only one valid blockchain, you don't have a blockchain.  Because you don't understand the game theory behind the blockchain, you have zero comprehension of why this matters.

Crypto implies crypto-currency, not cryptography. Cryptography without crypto-currency is simply a digital token ; A cryptographic signature with censorship resistance, i.e. government, which allows them to change or override the cryptographic proof, for political reasons. It's like a key to a hotel room. Sure, only that key with that signature, can open that lock. But the hotel can always make another key.  Your assertion is that a cryptographically secure hotel lock system is a crypto, even if they can override it.  I could turn a hotel locking system into a crypto by simply hashing the guest name with salt.  
Therefore, government crypto is an oxymoron.

Ah the ol no intrinsic value meme. I use [the 1:10000 rule]( for this argument.  It is my opinion that the intrinsic value of bitcoin is far far greater than anyone really comprehends.  People generally are too focused on people just buying and selling the asset, but not about the cryptographic proof, and incentive structure that perpetuates the network functioning.  So when people like to ask what the intrinsic value of bitcoin is, I say :
You are thinking of the store of value property without the cryptographic property that secures it. You are talking about it as one would talk about valuable shells, and even shell sellers, and not the security that separates it from all forms of value exchange before it. To understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin it is good to use the analogy of an envelope. So i ask you : does an envelope have intrinsic value?
If I have a letter that I need to send securely, would I prefer to send it open, and ready to be read? Or would I prefer for it to be sent within the confines of an envelope? Now let's think... would I prefer to just leave an open envelope, or would I think it necessary to put some seal across it to ensure that it isn't opened, and read whilst en-route. Does a sealable envelope have more intrinsic value than an unsealable one? Hmm... but what if someone can counterfeit the seal? I need some method of ensuring that the message I want to get to that person isn't read, and preferably, isn't even identified as a message. That's when you need to get lawyers involved. Sounds expensive. There's obviously something intrinsically valuable about such a service, because many people pay oh-so-very-much money for it.
Now let's imagine we're not talking about letters, we're talking about money. Would you address a $100 note through the mail to your child for their birthday? You'd pay for a stamp at least. Would you encase it in an envelope that you paid for at the local post-shop? Hmm... bill in the envelope.  Anyone will be able to see that it is money. Perhaps encase it in a card? What if it is $1000? $10,000? $10 million?  Does the protection service of an envelope somehow decrease because the value of the contents of the package increases? It's the opposite, isn't it? Bitcoin is both the cryptographically sealed envelope, and the network to deliver it.
What say you? Is an envelope intrinsically valuable?

You should learn how to store your seeds and wallets, delete your wallets, and reinstate them from the seeds. You need to safely secure those seeds, because if they are stolen your money can be gone in an instant. Start small first and learn. There is no rush. Bitcoin is about financial sovereignity.

The problem with layer 1 bitcoin is you simply don't know what the miner fees are going to be in two years time.  With lightning, and batching the creation of channels for paying the tippers, small transactions become viable.  Most importantly, you could even build it such that if a pathway already exists from the tippee and the tipper, you might never need to handle funds at all.
But you are completely correct.  It isn't ready yet. 
If you're not aware, this is also on the horizon. 
For your use case, there would be virtually nothing more efficient.

 It depends on what node your wallet points to.   If you don't know, you should find out.  If you want to be sure, download the core node software, sync the blockchain, and use that node as your wallet.

There were thirteen women and i was the only guy.  I counted em.  Not a single one of these women would have been hired for their sex.  Nor their looks.

I apologise.  I was needlessly aggressive, whoever you are.  
There is a very big gap between where my understanding is about this particular tech today, compared to where i started.  It is not intuitive.  It requires grasping a new concept for most people. 
If you want to understand about bitcoin and game theory, you need to understand that consensus in bitcoin is not the same as the regular definition of it.  i would suggest starting here :
When you understand that, you will start to get how the game theory  in bitcoin works.

It is part of the solution to the Byzantine generals problem. Don't worry too much about it though.  The miners know this, which is why when push came to shove with 2x, they fell into line before they felt the wrath. There is nothing particularly special about the SHA256 hashing algorithm that is currently used in bitcoin.  There are plenty of others.  
The node owners in bitcoin, the peers, that enforce consensus for their transactions, know they hold all of the bullets.  Miners live in permanent fear that they will be recognized as a systemic threat.  If they ever actually attacked the blockchain by censoring addresses through 51% attacks, the pow would be changed, and they would have a few billion dollars worth of expensive loud space heaters.

Fall?  Who said that?  Bitcoin is going to continue to expand until fixed asset capital returns cease to be a viable investment instrument.  Lots more inflation before that happens.  It took us 50 years to dig this hole.  It'll take us 50 years to fill it back in.  The more the existing system is propped up the more that bitcoin is going to increase in value.  Right up to the point where you'll stop measuring it in the metric that keeps on losing its purchasing power.

Not really.  If they don't have a channel open already, you just create one.  Have a minimum threshold (10x the miner fee?) where it won't create a channel until over that threshold.  The tipping service would act as a cache, which is no different than any other tipping service.  If the people already have channels, it can be immediate.
The great thing about doing it in lightning, is that you wouldn't need to 'fund' a tipping account.  The only thing that would be necessary would be to have an open channel to the tipping lightning node.

HTTP started out as nothing more than NNTP with a smaller and faster cache.  What do you think get/post means?  Instead of acquiring content from an NNTP server, which has a secondary function of replicating between other NNTP servers, you connect to a HTTP server, and like NNTP, replicate the sought content locally, and then you read that content from your local cache. 
PS+EDIT : If ya wanna be pedantic about it, SMTP and NNTP are both extended from the same technology.  Indeed, it was that distributed store of research information which included email and discussion topics, developed as a safeguard against nuclear attack.  Hence, why it was created.  In the end though, HTTP as it started (before streaming really) was really just an extension of an already existing protocol.  I started using NNTP back in 1985.

It is up to the users to decide how to repel attackers.  They do that by changing the PoW.  This isn't a problem core can solve, it's a problem that users solve, by adopting a consensus change that crushes the miners.  It's not even that complex.
@_date: 2017-10-01 03:52:40

Education is the only long-term strategy, because only through education and productivity increases do you dig yourself out of this demographic hole.

?  The nodes can simply change the PoW algorithm.


!!!?  Yeah.  There is. 
You really don't know how this thing works. 


Because you don't understand.  The point.  People are trying to explain it to you, but you are either unwilling to attempt to understand, or incapable of understanding, what is being explained. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:25:56
The 100,000 core reference nodes remain unconvinced by your argument. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:58:16


That's not it at all.  A 51% attack can stop all blocks by simply mining empty blocks, and re-orging out any other chain by only building on their blocks.
It is my expectation that bitmain already has more than 51%.  The only thing that is stopping them from actually attacking the bitcoin chain is that if they do, the nodes will change the PoW and their hardware will become instantly obsolete.  Even if the numpties don't understand how nodes work, they certainly will.  With the 2x hard-fork, they get to test the theory if they want to.
It all depends on if they feel lucky.  If they think they can get enough exchange support, they might try it.  I hope they do, because I want there to be a permanent lesson to miners what happens if you use mining to attack the bitcoin chain.  The only thing this entire exercise has done is highlight to everyone the importance of running and using your node.   As long as you use your node, you know for sure you're using bitcoin.  Enough users and holders recognize this, so it is immaterial what a bunch of shysters and charlatans do.  I'd love for bitmain to attack the bitcoin SHA-256 chain.  A PoW change is exactly what bitcoin needs.  It will put this scaling 'debate' behind us once and for all.

Just this part.  I imagine it would be conceivable for a blockchain to secure things that aren't tokens, as long as the tokens existed to incentivize mining.  Not sure why you'd do it, but I can't think of any reason why you can't.  So the transferring of value from one place to another is how bitcoin is used, but I'm not sure that's the actual requirement of a blockchain.

Horseshit.  The only reason that there is anything to invest in, is because at least some of the people who have invested in it, like me, understand the value proposition.  Speculators come and go, but every time they come and go, more people learn about the technology, and invest in it accordingly.
I get it, you don't understand the value proposition, and you don't understand the technology.  No-one is holding a gun to your head to change that.  If you don't like it, you know where the door is.  I would encourage you to seek your investment returns elsewhere.

Don't fucking buy it then.  No-one is holding a gun to your head ffs.  You wanna go to a casino and throw your money away, I aint gonna stop ya.

I have been handsomely rewarded for it, and I will continue to be.  Remind me in one year, two years, three years, five years.  I don't care.

No.  That is exactly the opposite of what I said.  Nodes are the validators.  They are the only validators.  Every node validates every block and every transaction.  If they have received a new block from a miner, and they validate that it meets consensus rules, because it is built upon the previous valid block, it is added.  That's why it is called a blockchain.  If someone creates a new node that accepts different blocks, as soon as it tries to connect to the other nodes, its blocks are rejected.
The consensus rules are what define it being bitcoin.  There is no 'fake block'.  It either meets consensus rules, and it is accepted, or it doesn't meet consensus rules, and it is therefore rejected.  By every node.  Always.

I use windows, linux, and mac.  As a laptop, my mac is easily the best I've ever used, and especially for development work.  With vmware fusion and a chunk of ram, it's very hard to beat.  Not really feasible to do the reverse.  The screens are also second to none.  If you are developing you are unlikely on a day to day basis to be using the device you're developing for, so it's really about what is the easiest to configure dev environment, and because of its roots in unix, a mac is generally just easier.   The only real exception is programming in .NET.  no real surprise about that though.

Hey.  No one is forcing you to use it.  If you can't see the value proposition, don't invest in it.

There is the school of thought that says "be the better person" and use reason against relentless lies and social media attacks.  Go Greg. There is the other school of thought that says "shout the stupid numpties down.".  I tried  and all they did was raise the volume.  I now use  on the known purveyors of lies that choose to raise the volume.  
Sometimes people find it confrontational.  Personally i think it highlights who is telling the lies, regardless of how it is achieved.

@_date: 2017-10-31 22:14:43
yep, and if the miners are attacking any one coin, you have to be especially careful, because you might not find out that you have been replay attacked until some time after you think you've got a many-times confirmed transaction.  I'm still not sure how many confirmations I'll feel comfortable with.  100?  200?  And that could take a little while.
The telling thing will be whether there is a signficant drop off in total hashing that looks like it has disappeared.  Blocks are getting confirmed on the bitcoin chain, but the 2x chain hashing doesn't have the amount that should be expected.  That could mean that attacking miners are mining bitcoin in stealth, building on their own blocks, and only commit longer bitcoin chain to the blockchain after many confirmations, wiping out all bitcoin transactions in the meantime.  They could, for example, include all of the 2x transactions in that one big dump.
Then, of course, there may be no actual fork at all, at least for some time, because no miners produce blocks over 1mb base.
We shall see.

there's nothing slow about 100% yoy returns.  In order for that to be the case, bitcoin would need to be about USD$3200 in november.  That will constitute the 4th doubling in four years.  200-&gt;400-&gt;800-&gt;1600-&gt;3200.  There is a  total period of about six weeks in the entire history of bitcoin in which the price has been higher.

I wouldn't go that far.  Atomic swaps work for coins that aren't transaction malleable.  Shapeshift can be used for transferring from bch to btc for example.   Atomic swaps aren't likely to exist for that pair because of the lack of the malleability fix in bch.

@_date: 2018-02-12 11:53:52


?  I don't know why you think this is the case.  When a block is orphaned, the nodes that accept the longer chain release the transactions that were housed in the orphaned block back to their mempool.  They then validate that the chain they have doesn't contain the transactions in their mempool, and then continue on as they did before.
The blockchain is the consecutive hashing of every block, with their bundled transactions.  Sometimes there are re-orders because miners produce blocks at the same time, but that type of scenario is quickly resolved by the nodes accepting the blocks that are built upon by the most hash-rate.  Once the reorg happens, the discarded chain is ignored.  If miners continue building on that block, and nodes decide to accept those non-consensus blocks, you have a fork.  But the only way that happens is because they have a modified set of consensus rules.
PS+EDIT: For the record dude, this is a rabbit hole.  The more you understand, the more you realise you don't understand, the more you try to understand it.  The tech is truly revolutionary.  It took me many years to get my head around it.  I don't know of anyone that immediately grasped it.

You should be more nervous about your money acting as a huge moneypot for hackers (or the government) and them being responsible for you losing everything.  That is why it is the number one rule, because history is littered with people who haven't followed that rule, and lost everything.
So it's time for you to learn.  Learn how to create a wallet in a tool [like electrum](  Create a wallet.  Back up the seeds (the words that define the wallet).  Delete the wallet.  Re-instate the wallet from the seeds.  Store the seeds off-site.  Transfer a small amount of bitcoin to the wallet.  Delete the wallet.  Restore the wallet from the seeds.  Validate that the funds are still in that wallet.
Now you know how to use a bitcoin wallet.

The people paying the bitcoin to attach them with a transaction.  There isn't any other real barrier.   You take outputs, prove that you are entitled to spend them, and write that data to the blockchain.  If it meets consensus, and miners accept the fee, it is done. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:11:22
 even if it is a soft fork (which i think is virtually certain) there really only needs to be a translation between newer and older nodes.  I'm obviously not being too specific, because the txn must meet consensus on older nodes, which is no mean feat. 
The underlying question is basically will it allow signature aggregation with utxo outputs that were created prior schnorr?

There is no such thing as a mining node.  A node is a node.  Every node independently polices and enforces consensus for each and every transaction and block.   The primary user group in bitcoin NOT to trust is miners.   Running a node and enforcing consensus rules for your transactions is what makes you a peer in bitcoin, peer-to-peer cash.  If you are not running a node you are not a peer.  Miners source transactions from nodes.  Miners need nodes, not the other way around.  They can be fired as a group by the nodes agreeing to a consensus change. 
That narrative you've just put forward is the one put forward by the rbtc numpties.  They get told of this for years, and can't figure out why their hijack attempts at bitcoin consensus always fail.  They fail because in order to change bitcoin consensus rules, it must be either opt-in, like segwit, or all nodes using existing consensus rules must discontinue being used, by essentially every person who uses a node, or the consensus change is just the creation of another alt.

There are two things that are being confused here.  When someone says they can close the channel at any time, they actually have to wait a week if the other participant is non cooperative or not available.  So if either triggers the channel closure, the other participant has a week to validate whether the distribution the other participant is the same as they have record of.  If both agree, the funds are released immediately.  If they don't agree, it will only happen because one participant has 'lied' about the transactions, and therefore the other participant receives all of the funds in the channel.  So the incentive is to not attempt to lie, and ensure your lightning node is activated once a week.  People like me will likely have their lightning hubs on all the time on a node that we control .

Until other miners are prepared to mine for bitcoin they are part of the 2x attack.  F2pool and slush are doing the intelligent thing.  We shall see whether that is enough to warrant not changing the pow.   I hope for the honest miners sake that they come to their senses.

A 51% attack has nothing to do with validation.  It is simply a miner selecting which valid transactions ( as defined buy the nodes ) to hash, and choosing not to hash specific transactions.   Tell me genius : what happens if they choose to include a block greater than 4mb weight, i.e. greater than the 1mb base?  If it was, as you say, totally up to mining validators, couldn't they just have increased the blocksize already?  What stopped them?
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:44:42


Yes.   With a maximum possible of 4mb with the current tech. 


They don't.

Without replay protection, BOTH chains can have their funds moved from wallets.  You can pay 2x, and lose your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:49:13
There is no 'may' about it.  The only thing it stands for now, is a way to separate the unaware from their bitcoin either through replay attacks or through the selling of the 2x tokens to useful idiots, and buying more bitcoin.

It would be a good way to accept bitcoin payments through lightning.  Open up a channel with exchange, put 0.02BTC in it.  Pay exchange 0.1BTC.  Exchange wallet is credited 0.1BTC.  Withdraw 0.1BTC with regular BTC txn.  You now have 0.1BTC in a 0.2BTC channel, you can receive 0.1BTC through that channel, and you have 0.1BTC in another wallet. 
Exchanges ( and you ) can then earn microfees for lightning transactions that use your channel for pathing.  As reserve of bitcoin not in channels reduces, close channels of participants that are inactive. No honey pot for hackers either.  In order to hack the coins in channels they'd have to close them and wait a week.

A node keeps a copy of the blockchain in their installation.  Every node validates every transaction and every block to ensure they adhere to consensus rules, so every node independently arrives at the same point.  In order to run a node, you have to download the entire blockchain to your node, and validate every block and transaction on the way to the current block.  The sync depends on your internet speed, obviously, but in Australia it's about two days to sync from the genesis block.
You can prune your node so that historical blocks are not kept, and only the unspent coins are available on the node (called the UTXO), which is all that is really needed in order to send/receive transactions.
I'd recommend taking the time to do it.  I have one installed on a virtual machine.

- No, I want you to count the apples.  I'm making apple pie, and the pie will be ruined if I use oranges instead of apples.
- But the oranges are fruit too, why don't you want me to count them?
- Because they aren't apples.  I want to know how many apples there are, because I'm making apple pie.
- But oranges are sort of spherical too, so I should probably include them, right?
- No.  I just want you to count the apples.  The only thing I need in order to make apple pie are apples.  Not oranges.

'they' can't though.  They can only damage.  Node hold the power in bitcoin because they pay the bills.  The only things miners can do is render the SHA-256 PoW algorithm useless.  But if it is useless, there is no incentive to keep using it, so the nodes upgrade to a new PoW, and get a new set of miners.  No replay protection.  Nothing.  Because it's a new PoW, new miners flood into the system for dem sweet sweet rewards, which means difficulty targets will increase greater than the SHA-256 targets, so all SPV wallets would simply see the new algo chain as the true bitcoin chain.  
Sure, the price will be hit.  But the plus side is the miners get crushed in such a humiliating way that none will ever attempt it in the future.
This is the fire that miners are playing with.  Play by the rules or you all get crushed.

Not if the SHA-256 bitcoin chain is rendered useless by attacking miners.  Then the choice is
1. Upgrade your node to 0.16 with new PoW
2. Uninstall your node, and ever use bitcoin again.
3. Downgrade your node to the 2x node client, accept that they will increase the blocksize until you can't run a node anymore, and then complete with option 2.
There is really only one choice.  I'm hoping that they do attack the SHA-256 chain so that this can be realized.

It will be a bonanza for anyone wanting to earn a bit of bitcoin in the mining game again.  Then the choice is :
1. Upgrade your node to 0.16 with new PoW
2. Uninstall your node, and ever use bitcoin again.
3. Downgrade your node to the 2x node client, accept that they will increase the blocksize until you can't run a node anymore, and then complete with option 2.
There is really only one choice.  Upgrade your node, and continue on your merry way, or cease validating the blockchain.  It won't even be a difficult choice.  I'm hoping that they do attack the SHA-256 chain so that this can be realized.

It's certain.  There was some analysis that single addresses were simply whittling down their balances by creating one txn a second.  But meh.  It's a known attack vector.  The fact that bitcoin has a fee market ensures that the cost of such an attack is always greater than the return.  It's inconvenient, but not much more.  It's not the last time it'll happen.  With lightning it's going to limit its effectiveness as more money is enabled for instant transactions.

Change the pow and move all  existing nodes, and implement thousands of non-replay protected hard-fork nodes using a multitude of alternate pows on the asic chain.  You think other people don't know how to play that attack?   The difference is all of the developers will move from defence to attack. 
You know the one thing bitcoin nodes aren't tied to?  The asic pow.  You know what the asic miners are tied to?  The asic pow.
Bitcoin nodes  will remain unaffected.

I'm happy with 20% hashing to start.  Miners will mine where they get bitcoin. It all depends if the miners attack the bitcoin chain. 
If miners attack the bitcoin chain by mining empty blocks, we can get a new pow.  With a new pow that nodes actually upgrade to, and no replay protection (return the favor eh?), new miners.  These ones will know how to behave. Even better than that, with a new pow you will get accelerated difficulty resets until hashing normalises, so longer chain and spv wallets will blindly follow you
Hmmm...  decisions decisions.  Upgrade to core v.15.3 and use bitcoin,  because miners attack the sha-256 chain and make a blockchain of empty blocks.  Or downgrade to 2x and lose your ability to run a node, because of the very people who have rendered the sha-256 algorithm unusable.  Choose wisely. 
Please miners.  Pretty please?  Attack the sha-256 chain.  Nothing would please me more than to see this play out.  Take one for the team.  So that, in the future, we can speak in hushed tones of the day that miners forever learned their role in consensus.  Do it.  Dooooooo it.
 I can't see it though.  They can't be as dumb as the rbtc numpties.  Can they?
PS+EDIT: i can almost feel the reptilian little brains thinking "hang on, that can't work can it?".  Followed by "but but but but... that's not *fair*!".  And all because even to this day, they still haven't grasped consensus.  Run your node. Use your node. If you do, you decide what bitcoin is.

I don't think you actually understand what bitcoin is. You are thinking of the  payment system property without the cryptographic property that secures it. You are talking about it as one would talk about valuable shells, and even shell sellers, and not the security that separates it from all forms of value exchange before it. To understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin it is good to use the analogy of an envelope. So i ask you : does an envelope have intrinsic value?
If I have a letter that I need to send securely, would I prefer to send it open, and ready to be read? Or would I prefer for it to be sent within the confines of an envelope. Now let's think... would I prefer to just leave an open envelope, or would I think it necessary to put some seal across it to ensure that it isn't opened, and read whilst en-route. Does a sealable envelope have more intrinsic value than an unsealable one? Hmm... but what if someone can counterfeit the seal? I need some method of ensuring that the message I want to get to that person isn't read, and preferably, isn't even identified as a message. That's when you need to get lawyers involved. Sounds expensive. There's obviously something intrinsically valuable about such a service, because many people pay oh-so-very-much money for it.
Now let's imagine we're not talking about letters, we're talking about money. Would you address a $100 note through the mail to your child for their birthday? You'd pay for a stamp at least. Would you encase it in an envelope that you paid for at the local post-shop? Hmm... bill in the envelope. Perhaps encase it in a card? What if it is $1000? $10,000? Does the protection service of an envelope somehow decrease because the value of the contents of the package increases? It's the opposite, isn't it?
What say you? Is an envelope intrinsically valuable?

The thing that it is counter-intuitive about crypto, is that the solution to electronic anonymous and censorship resistant money, turned out being record everything forever. When someone can flick a switch and take everything from you, you don't have freedom. When you can access the ledger from anyone, prove that it it is valid, and be able to send your money to anyone, for whatever purpose, you do.
It is my opinion that this technology has been developed as a direct response to the insidious and anti-democratic implementation of AML/KYC laws on a global scale over the past 30 years. The extrapolation of these laws, given a long enough timeline, is slavery. Not figurative slavery, actual slavery.
Bitcoin is the technical response to that problem.

Blockchain isn't a database, it's a concept.  The concept is decentralization.  It transcends any particular implementation or technology.  You're either decentralized, or you're not.  And if you are, you're a blockchain, and if you're not you're a shitcoin.  If you can just change the consensus rules whenever you feel like it, you're not a blockchain, you're a database.




Wow.  You seriously have no idea how bitcoin works.  You just demonstrated that.  That's like "I'm a person who has no concept of what a node is or does, and I'm going to argue about decentralization" kind of dumb.  I'm going to give up on you now.  Revel in your ignorance.

If the miners attack the SHA-256 chain of bitcoin, bitcoin nodes will simply change the PoW.

Those people are represented by the node users.  The users that choose to use nodes to validate their own transactions.  The entire purpose of bitcoin is to protect those users. 


The fuck it is.  It is the protection of your wealth when shysters and charlatans think they can steal the system from underneath you.  They can't.  As long as you use your node to validate your transactions, you know you are using bitcoin. That is exactly why the system is built the way it is.  So that it doesn't matter what some shyster wants to call their shitcoin.  Because you know what bitcoin is. Because you are using a node that validates whether it is bitcoin. 
Fools and their money are soon parted.  If you wanna be a fool and buy the snake oil of the bankers like coinbase, you deserve to lose it.  You have the method to protect your wealth.  Run a node.  Use your node.  If you choose not to, don't say you weren't warned.

I think mortgages for houses that you live in will exist, but the price of the house relative to your income will return to the mean.  Mortgages for houses that are rented will exist, and the rent will be only slightly higher than the mortgage + maintenance.  Mortgages for houses that remain empty will not exist.  So there will be less consumer banking required, because right now, flipping houses is the only viable way for a consumer to build capital in a system designed to fleece them of savings.
So the entire housing market will be more efficient, because empty houses will no longer be a viable investment instrument.

I have no idea.  I don't think anyone does. I think crypto-currency is going to change the world.  It has long been my position that the rise of crypto is as a response to the insidious and anti-democratic implementation of AML/KYC regulations. If the US, the country that is behind forcing all countries to adopt them, actually cared about terrorism funding, they'd stop funding it. Bitcoin is the technical response to that theft of freedom. The laws were only ever about control, where supposedly free people went from being innocent until proven guilty, to guilty until you can prove you are innocent.  The civil asset forfeiture legislation of the united states harms americas claim to being a bastion of freedom in unimaginable ways.
Over the next 10 years, i expect those laws to become increasingly irrelevant. All they'll do is stop people wanting to use banks.  So the  number value is irrelevant.  The ability of people to step out of the current financial system that has stolen their productive gains will continue on until there isn't any need to use the legacy system.

Be very careful which chain you are recording your transactions on.  Avoid using the 2x chain unless you can validate that your transactions in that chain haven't been replayed into the bitcoin chain.  The only way i know you do that without tainting or using the malicious AIDS that is the 2x opt-in replay protection, is to migrate coins in bitcoin between addresses i control, until i can validate that the 2x chain isn't replaying those transactions, and then sell that piece of shit as soon as i am able.

There are three groups in bitcoin.  The users, the holders, and the miners.
Pow aligns consensus with the users, because it is the users that are paying the miners. Even holders require users, and more importantly, node owners. Pos aligns consensus with the holders, who are paying the miners. It is the incentive of the payers, not the paid, that imo is the wild invention of sn, and enacted through cryptography.
Pos fails because there is only one outcome given that incentive structure.  Holders being miners, and then controlling the users. Pow overcomes  this because the outcome is the constant tension between all three. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:43:02
Then the users say 'fuck this' and change the pow.  They get a new set of miners, and the holders go 'holy shit, do I wanna spend my cash with a bunch of numpties that couldn't behave themselves?'.  And they start spending their cash on the chain that the users say is the real one, and everyone just goes about their business again.
Whoever attacks loses, and there's no real way to cheat the system.  That's the brilliant solution to the byzantine generals problem.

I reckon you're over-thinking it.  It doesn't matter what anyone thinks.  twitter accounts, subreddits, .com demains... it doesn't matter.  If bitcoin is what it is purported to be, the wheat will be separated from the chaff.
It is wild west days, with lots of people making outrageous claims.  But the tech is revolutionary.  See how it works out.  It doesn't really require anyone's understanding.  It relies on human nature.  It's very clever.

I'm trying to get you to understand that it is important to understand that the only thing that matters is the consensus rules you apply with your bitcoin node.  Everything else is secondary.  It is the power of this decentralization that defines bitcoin.  It is what you make it for yourself.

 As far as I'm aware, these are the original project team.  At least a significant portion of them. The problem they had is that their imagination entailed copying an existing model, eBay, and adding bitcoin.   They haven't really grasped the ramifications of the underlying tech.  Along the way, they got swept up in the numpty-verse, and started actually believing that shit. 
I'm really not sure anyone will ever take them seriously again.  So much self inflicted brand damage.  It's bizarre.

 electrum on both mobile and desktop is good.  It even allows you to create transactions online and sign them on an airgapped computer.  Look at their help files on cold storage.  Short of running a node wallet it is probably the best security available.

Nup.  Bitcoin is not efficient as a payment network, and won't be for some time.  That has not affected its price, exactly the opposite.  I personally wish the people who's minds only extend to PayPal v2.0 would just use PayPal.  Bitcoin will get to frictionless cash, but only when it is truly decentralised and completely censorship resistant.  The layer 1 is simply not suitable at this time for that use case, without a great deal of effort.

In principle, if they wanted to add any coin, who can criticize?  But they don't want to do that.  They jumped on fail train  2x, and have hated everything about bitcoin since.   It ain't just pacia either. 
The sad thing, and i mean it's really sad, is that if they had any strategic sense whatsoever, they could be the center of lightning and bitcoin.  Instead, at every lost opportunity, they are simply ensuring that they might be remembered as a footnote.  Maybe.

@_date: 2017-10-20 02:25:41


Yes.  As in completely.  
The only thing it wouldn't be able to do is query the blockchain the node houses for historical transactions.  But you can get them in lots of places if you want to, and those blocks have already been validated by your node.  The pruning process simply removes them from your node after the validation process is complete.

The thing that it is counter-intuitive about crypto, is that the solution to electronic anonymous and censorship resistant money, turned out being record everything forever. When someone can flick a switch and take everything from you, you don't have freedom. When you can access the ledger from anyone, prove that it it is valid, and be able to send your money to anyone, for whatever purpose, you do.
It is my opinion that this technology has been developed as a direct response to the insidious and anti-democratic implementation of AML/KYC laws on a global scale over the past 30 years. The extrapolation of these laws, given a long enough timeline, is slavery. Not figurative slavery, actual slavery. 
Bitcoin is the technical response to that problem.

The risk is that immediately after the fork you no longer hold bitcoin, but 2x.  Right now, that is the agreement that coinbase has signed up for.  They keep your bitcoin. 
You need to learn how to use a wallet like electrum or samouri.  You create wallets.  Back the seeds up.   Store the seeds off site.   Delete the wallets.   Remove the apps/programs.  Reinstall the programs.   restate the wallets from the seeds.   Transfer small values to them.   Delete them.  Restore them from backup seeds.   Etc etc. 
You have to ask yourself whether learning this is worth the value of losing everything. 
If you want to be sure, do this entire process using a core reference node wallet.  
Only then are you a full participant in the bitcoin network.

Open the wallet on an airgapped PC with electrum.  Easy enough to install it.  Create a watch-only wallet from that airgapped pc, and copy it to a usb.  Take the watch-only wallet to a networked pc that has electrum on it, and load the watch-only wallet.  If there are funds there, it is a legitimate wallet.

That's bitcoin.  It is always going to be this.  Attack attack attack.  Every attack repelled is another permanent shield.   I almost wish the miners would actually attack the SHA256 chain.   That's how you would get those 100,000+ nodes to fork.  Fork to a different pow.  Sure bitcoin would drop in value.  But no miner would ever attempt the attack again.  The sha256 chain would implode.   Every holder would run to the exits.  It would be glorious.

But every time a transaction goes to someone that doesn't choose to use this format for their transactions, that upper bound gets to be reduced.  It's not even like an  upper band though, is it?  It's an exact value between X (all inputs that are obfuscated) and Y (all outputs that still remain obfuscated minus the values that have been removed).  How much went in, and how much has been extracted.  How much still exists can be defined as what exists between all of the transactions that share this common value.  If that format isn't continued, at some point, you'll know exactly how much went in, how much went out, and where it all went out, yes?
I'm trying to figure out for myself where the use-case is for this type of thing given this understanding, or whether there's something amiss in my understanding?
EDIT: just so we're clear, I'm not even sure what I'm asking matters.  It might very well lead to an outcome i haven't even imagined.  Might=probably.

@_date: 2017-10-09 11:31:58
If that were your only concern, shifting to monero through an exchange, and then exporting out to discrete amounts of bitcoin would effectively make it very hard to trace backward.  I'm sure if you were buying rocket launchers, that might not be good enough security, but it wouldn't be possible to reverse engineer that without a significant amount of effort.  Depending on the exchange, even that might be impossible.
If you want to be really secure with this type of thing, and 50btc is the kind of thing that warrants this type of security, you need to run the node wallets of the cryptos that you're seeking to use.

 Because it was a Japanese company that had Japanese liquidators appointed when it went bankrupt.  In order to repay creditors based upon "making creditors whole" they can only use a metric that the law of Japan recognizes.   That 'whole' value is defined as the value, in Japanese currency, of the creditor debits at the time of bankruptcy.   So they sell assets to get that capital. 
The only big question is what happens to the remaining assets after the creditors have been made whole, and whether those creditors are entitled to the remaining assets.

Incorrect.  You have a very narrow definition of investment.  You'll probably need to actually validate it before you make such assertions going forward.  The key differentiator is whether you understand the underlying value proposition of the asset.  Speculators do not, they're interested simply in trading based upon sentiment.  The market needs both, but just because you have a definition that is generally not even accepted as valid, doesn't mean you get to label it incorrectly. 






Do you understand the underlying value proposition of an instrument?  Investment.  Do you hedge?  Investment.  Are you driven by sentiment?  Speculation.  Are you only interested market arbitrage?  Speculation.

If they pull back, we'll still have numpties thinking miners control consensus, and that somehow they've been thwarted again by core.  That is dangerous because it shouldn't always be the case that you're relying upon the integrity of the core contributors, even while right now we can.

Most standard transactions are ~220 bytes, not 300.  From segwit it's about 150.   So it's about 4c for std, and about 3c for segwit. 
It's worse for coinbase though.  As in, they are a bunch of shit nozzles.  The address component is about 50 bytes.  If they batched, they could be paying 1c for each address, and a further 3c for the change and signature.  If they really wanted to take no chances,  they could be using 5c per address and rbf, and if it didn't confirm immediately, which it should, they could double or triple it to 10c or 15c to ensure it did.   Instead they are paying 100x the rate that it costs, and then blaming the txn costs on block sizes.

Without the entire blockchain, you can never create a new node.  Each node validates every block and every transaction independently since the genesis block.  Sure, you can discard that information for your own node when it is no longer necessary, but unless you independently validate every block and every transaction, you have to trust someone.

Miners are threatening to attack bitcoin if the bitcoin node owners don't stop using their nodes, and use the malicious buggy 2x node client instead.  But their only real attack is to demonstrate that the SHA-256 algorithm is no longer suitable for use with bitcoin, by mining empty blocks by re-orging out the remaining SHA-256 miners.  As soon as they demonstrate that, there will be an emergency PoW change, all nodes will upgrade (because they have to), and that will be the end of that.  Entire drama over in about two weeks.  We also get a golden age of new miners adopting the new algorithm, whatever that is.  
No one is going to use that piece of shit algorithm after it has been demonstrated that the miners can't be trusted.  Every single SHA-256 supplier will be out of business within a year, if not sooner.

That is ridiculously simplistic, has no relationship whatsoever to the byzantine generals problem, and kinda just proves what I said.  Take a seat me lad, and let me explain.
This is actually a game theory problem.  There are three groups in bitcoin. The users, the holders, and the miners.  To understand the way that relationship works, you have to understand what keeps everyone separated and honest.  That requires an understanding of the incentives of bitcoin, and that requires understanding what [proof-of-work]( is.
Proof-of-work aligns consensus with the users, because it is the users that are paying the miners. Even holders require users, and more importantly, node owners.  Therefore, it is users that are incentivizing the miners.  [Proof-of-stake]( aligns consensus with the holders, who are paying the miners. It is the incentive of the payers, not the paid, that imo is the wild invention of satoshi, and enacted through cryptography.
Pos fails because there is only one outcome given that incentive structure. Holders being miners, and then controlling the users. Pow overcomes this because the outcome is the constant tension between all three. 
*At the heart of the solution is the byzantine generals problem.*  The problem is "if you are a number of generals surrounding a castle, how do you give the attack date and ensure that the message to attack is correctly received, when you know that the message may be altered along the way?"  I have reduced it to three.  Given you know one is a traitor, how do you deliver a message? 
The way that this is managed is that miners order the transactions, and race to hash them to an algorithm (the work in proof-of-work), which is in bitcoin, SHA-256, until they get an answer that they will be accepted by the nodes (proof).  They are incentivized to become more and more efficient, and spend more resources as the price increases. The nodes provide the proof in proof-of-work.  For that work, the nodes award miners bitcoin.  The nodes can prove which miner spent more work, but it sometimes takes a few blocks to get it right, which is why you have to wait for a few confirmations. 
The only real thing that miners can threaten to do is stop users (the people paying them) from receiving blocks.  Users and holders, after all, control their own cryptographic proofs to the tokens.  But the current miners are only miners of SHA-256 pow algorithm blocks.  In an adversarial condition, the miners will have just stopped coming to the party, so the users say 'fuck this' and change the pow. They get a new set of miners, mining a new algorithm, and the holders go 'holy shit, do I wanna spend my cash with a bunch of numpties that couldn't behave themselves?'. And they start spending their cash on the chain that the users say is the real one, and everyone just goes about their business again.  Old miners get crushed.  New miners think happy days.  If the nodes change their software, that's the end of the story. Because the nodes define the consensus, they can. The remaining node owners get to decide whether they want to be owned by the miners, or whether they actually want to still remain users. The holders decide whether they are more likely to be able to realize their money with the miners that now control a drastically centralized subset of nodes, or to continue on in the system that led to their being holders in the first place.
Users can't attack the system, because then they would become holders, and users would no longer trust them for the reasons already stated, and they don't hold the cryptographic proofs of the holders. If the holders do that, they lose all of their users, so the only thing they game-theory-wise would do, would be to instate a pow.  Why would anyone prefer a system in which the people with the money have all of the power?  Otherwise known as the world financial system.
Whoever attacks loses, and there's no real way to cheat the system. That's the brilliant solution to the byzantine generals problem.  It is a self-sustaining financial system that rewards everyone for participating in it, where incentives are perfectly aligned for its longevity, with an ever reducing supply of tokens that are effectively infinitely divisible, increasing their value per-capita.  And no, there isn't any other system in the world that shares these properties.

It is what node is used to interact with the blockchain that defines the consensus rules that the node user is prepared to accept.  Nodes that people don't use are just lines on a graph.  If you can't convince the people using their nodes to make transactions to adopt different consensus rules, you don't have consensus, so ya got nuffin.

Totally see where you are coming from, and this is of course another part of the attack.  But it is not the 51% one. 
Coinbase can shill a shitcoin as bitcoin for as long as they like, but they can't make people discontinue the use of their bitcoin nodes.  The value will reside with the decentralized coin regardless of whether a shyster puts a btc on their snake-oil.  They will lose millions for as long they keep up the charade.  Selfish self interest will draw miners to the coin that has the value.  If the miners choose to attack the bitcoin implementation of SHA-256 ( which i hope they do ) there is a PoW change.   There won't be any replay protection either.  Why would there need to be, the SHA-256 chain is useless.   All you do is set the trigger block for the pow change at the start of the attack. 
They can throw millions at it, but in the end, they will either fall into line and mine the profitable chain, get crushed, or both.  There is no way that bitmain comes out of this situation in a better situation than when they went to it.  The only rationale that there could possibly be for this behavior is that they are under water and bleeding money.  Only that could justify this behavior.  Doesn't matter though.

 Hey dude, I'm not one of the death to banks fellas.  I reckon investment banks are going to make out like bandits.  The consumer mortgage banking industry, however, is going to be narfled.  When the capital growth market for things like housing craters, because it really is nothing more than a proxy for inflation, ain't no one gon be bidding up the prices of houses using debt.  And when that liqudity dries up for housing, the institutions that feed on that debt hose will find it has become a drip.
Banks will go back to providing loans for building productivity, instead of loans to bid up the prices of fixed assets.  Cant happen too soon.

You do it then.  I'm not doing anything illegal.  The fact that you make this spurious claim, and you specifically state that you can't even validate it, again, says a lot more about you than it does about me.


So you can't even imagine a technical mechanism by which your assertion could be realized, can you?


Straw-man.  Money enables those things.  Bitcoin is money.  The only solution to the problem according to you, is to place everyone under surveillance.
It has long been my position that the rise of crypto is as a response to the insidious and anti-democratic implementation of AML/KYC regulations. If the US, the country that is behind forcing all countries to adopt them, actually cared about terrorism funding, they'd stop funding it. Bitcoin is the technical response to that theft of freedom. The laws were only ever about control, where supposedly free people went from being innocent until proven guilty, to guilty until you can prove you are innocent. The civil asset forfeiture legislation of the united states harms americas claim to being a bastion of freedom in unimaginable ways.
Over the next 10 years, i expect those laws to become increasingly irrelevant. All they'll do is stop people wanting to use banks. The ability of people to step out of the current financial system that has stolen their productive gains will continue on until there isn't any need to use the legacy system.
So basically, every single point I made about your screed remains un-addressed.

 Nodes define and police consensus in bitcoin, not miners. 
Which is why when the nodes threatened to orphan the blocks of miners that didn't signal segwit, that 60% non signaling of segwit  quickly became 0%.  Early.  Before they were going to orphan their blocks. Miners won't ever be asked to signal again. It was supposed to be a safety mechanism.  Miners made that safety mechanism unsafe.  So the mechanism has been removed.

It is all predicated on the premise that the miners attack the bitcoin SHA-256 chain.  Core will release the update, having selected a block for activation, and then there will be a frantic effort to activate miners of that algorithm.  It will be a bonanza for anyone wanting to earn a bit of bitcoin in the mining game again.  Then the choice is :
1. Upgrade your node to 0.16 with new PoW
2. Uninstall your node, and ever use bitcoin again.
3. Downgrade your node to the 2x node client, accept that they will increase the blocksize until you can't run a node anymore, and then complete with option 2.
There is really only one choice.  Upgrade your node, and continue on your merry way, or cease validating the blockchain.  It won't even be a difficult choice.  I'm hoping that they do attack the SHA-256 chain so that this can be realized.

It doesn't need to be a new wallet, just a new private key, but new wallet works.  As long as you can validate that your funds are in two different chains at two different addresses, you know that they are not replay attacked.
BUT!  Make sure you have a looooot of confirmations.  A miner attacking the network may conspire with exchanges to mine blocks anonymously and then cause a re-org of the chain, where it is not revealed until some length of time, that you have been the victim of a replay attack.  I will be waiting several days at least after I've split them into different addresses, before I start shifting around my 2x coins to exchanges so that I can sell them.

No actually.  You really don't.  
In order to understand bitcoin, you have to understand nodes.  Nodes and consensus as defined in the whitepaper and implemented in nodes.
 Let's start with [the bitcoin white paper]( :


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




What does this mean if you are but an intrepid traveler amongst the erstwhile numpty-folk?
Nodes are agents in a multi-agent system with [an agreed set of consensus rules]( which they and they alone enforce, that ensure that the system functions. Transactions are propagated through the multi-agent network based upon the agreed consensus rules by nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Miners retrieve valid transactions from any of these nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then order the transactions, and perform a hashing function on them until the hashing function returns a value that is suitable to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then pass the new block that they've created to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. The nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, then validate the block to ensure that each of the transactions within the block agree with the consensus rules. Then the node, which is an agent in a multi-agent system, extends the block-chain by attaching the new block to it.  They then pass the new block, if it is valid, to other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Then each of these other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, each do the same validation on every block.
Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node extends the blockchain.  Miners don't.  The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.  It is the validation of the nodes, and their CPU's, that define and police consensus in bitcoin.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, validate the transactions (using their CPU), replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks (using their CPU), extend the blockchain (using their CPU), replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.  If you can't convince these node owners that are using their node on a day-to-day basis, to uninstall their node software and install your new node client, especially when that node client decreases their node security and decreases the network security, any change you have is going to go exactly nowhere.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.  If you can't convince all of those node owners running their node clients to uninstall one client and re-install another, any change you have to consensus is DOA.

It has always been known that a PoW change would need to be implemented.  It might not have been known that mining would become so centralized, but I'm afraid that too many people have thought that the centralizing businesses and mining attackers would be rational enough to understand their exposure to this risk.
We now know that they have ignored this risk, and perhaps expected that everyone would have too much sympathy for the innocent people affected by any PoW change decision.
But they have made it into a survival by a PoW change, or accept death decision.  So node owners have to decide whether they adopt a PoW change, or accept losing control of bitcoin consensus rules forever.

It is simple.  Bitcoin has 100,000+ nodes, that people actually use, that police and enforce [nakamoto consensus](  They are impossible to coerce to change the consensus rules, even by the developers.   The only way any change is possible in the protocol is if they agree to it, and the only way they agree on changes is by updating their node software.  
 No other crypto has such decentralization, or such resistance to any protocol change that reduces the security of the network.

The point.


No they are not.  They are hashing them.  If they do not use the hashing algorithm defined in consensus, the block is rejected.


Which the full nodes validate.


No, the miners fail until they produce blocks that satisfy consensus, or they don't get propagated.  Ergo, it is the nodes that build the block-chain, because it is THEY who decide which blocks get added to the blockchain.

Freedom is hard, yes.  Actually requiring probable cause before being subjected to the justice system used to be a thing.  Then your government started stealing peoples money without ever even charging them with a crime.  So now we have crypto.  So people like you can't do that anymore.
"But but but what if they are committing a crime!" you say.   Prove it i say.  You know.  Rule of law. That's what democracies are supposed to be about aren't they?


And that attack on freedom now has crypto as a response.  The thing that it is counter-intuitive about crypto, is that the solution to electronic anonymous and censorship resistant money, turned out being record everything forever. When someone can flick a switch and take everything from you, you don't have freedom. When you can access the ledger from anyone, prove that it it is valid, and be able to send your money to anyone, for whatever purpose, you do.
As i said before, this technology has been developed as a direct response to the insidious and anti-democratic implementation of AML/KYC laws on a global scale over the past 30 years. The extrapolation of these laws, given a long enough timeline, is slavery. Not figurative slavery, actual slavery.
Bitcoin is the technical response to that problem.

 miners broke that agreement. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:25:10
Miners need to use nodes yes.  They can't earn bitcoin rewards unless they use nodes.  Miners need nodes more than nodes need miners of one specific hashing algorithm.  Miners need nodes so that they can sell bitcoin that has been mined according to the bitcoin consensus rules.  If miners want to change the consensus rules, the nodes that don't change won't give them bitcoin rewards.  That's what 2x is.
Miners are like guard dogs. They've been faithful at getting stronger and stronger, and protecting the house. But now they're starting to think they're the owners of the house, and not the guard dog, and are acting like they might attack the owner. So what do you do if your guard dog attacks you? You put him down. Get a new guard dog.

The fact that you didn't mention that when it is specifically the subject that we're talking about, immediately makes me distrust you and your wallet implementation.  In fact, it kinda makes me think you're trying to hide something.
**Will you be running core nodes?  Will you not?  Or don't you know?**

It's a broken metric, but there are interesting things that can be gleaned from it.  Three months ago there was no BCH.  Bitcoin was less than 40%.  Then, suddenly, there was a new asset valued, valued at 10 billion.  Three months later, bitcoin is greater than 50%.  The actual numbers are immaterial, but there's no way that that doesn't say that a significant amount of money has shifted from alts to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:34:40
He's really explaining the method behind heuristically determined wallets isn't he?  Take an elliptic curve which gives you one pairing, and use a second elliptic curve to acquire more points tied to that original point.  Also, the method that you need to use in order to ensure you can't derive the second elliptic curve given the points you know.  I certainly couldn't prove it, mind you, but I think that's it.
The theoretical question I've got about this is whether you could use the combined results and hashes in order to code more data into a transaction.  If you effectively have a massive space in which you could generate data through the second elliptic curve, couldn't you use a selection of outputs, or more to the point, a de-selection of unsuitable outputs, to code more data into a transaction?  Using this technique, you could target specific bits in a transaction id for a purpose over and above the already existing flags.

The only justification for a pow change is if the miners attack the sha256 chain.  If that happened, you would actually see an emergency hard-fork where 100,000+ core reference nodes upgrade. You'd also probably see a significant number of developers developing tools for attacking the remaining sha256 chain to render it unusable for the miners.  That's the nuclear option.

I know what's going to happen.  The 2x chain will crash and burn in a fiery heap, and hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure will be rendered useless.  No-one is going to choose to use the SHA-256 chain when they know that only a handful of centralized nodes define and control all consensus in the chain.  It will be no different than BCH.
But we will have finally seen the back of bitmain, and hopefully coinbase, and miners will forever learn that if you attack the bitcoin chain, you get crushed.  And this needs to happen now, before a state actor attempts this strategy, so that it is very clear that bitcoin nodes control and police consensus.

The iq tests  that were used in the 60s are now only used as examples of how cultural and socio-economic bias in test creation needs to be considered in the construction of a test.

The longest **valid** blockchain is bitcoin.  Nodes define validity in bitcoin, not miners.  100,000+ core reference nodes reject the validity of 2x.  Those 100,000+ core reference nodes that are enforcing bitcoin consensus are not going to just disappear over the next six weeks.

Segwit was written a year before the NYA. The blocksize increase increase that was included was the compromise with the classic fork. They got a blocksize increase, I got a malleability fix. Now they say "we want more."

In that instance, coinbase refused to hand over the bch for a month, probably as soon as lawyers started contacting them.   This time they will hold the bitcoin and give you the reduced value 2x tokens.  They have probably written up a disclaimer in the meantime that  they think absolves them of paying the bitcoin that is owed.

You're the only one that keeps saying this and it is repeatedly demonstrating that you don't know how bitcoin works.

Careful with that metric.  Coins in 'circulation', coins 'available' and coins 'released' are entirely different values. Coins available is always going to be less than coins in circulation, because of lost coins.   In bitcoin there is no 'coins released' metric, because it never had an ICO.  But in many alts, especially obviously the pre-mined ones', you have no idea what the ratio is between coins released and coins available.    Examples of pre-mined alts are Ripple and XEM/NEM.  Indeed, even ETH was a pre-mine.  To really see this in stark comparison, [look at XEM/NEM]( :  1.8billion market-cap, and 3 million daily volume.  Bitcoin is 50 times the market-cap and 500 times the volume.
Basically, if you are investing in a pre-mined coin, you are really investing in a company, and the market-cap means nothing.

Sure.  SHA-256 would be a dead chain.  There wouldn't even be any reason to implement replay protection, because it is not even possible to replay attacks onto a dead chain.

The number one rule of bitcoin is to never store your bitcoin on an exchange. Start now learning how to use a wallet that you control the keys for.
It is critically important at first to learn how to use a light wallet like electrum. Start with learning how to transfer small amounts. You should learn how to store your seeds and wallets, delete your wallets, and reinstate them from the seeds. You need to safely secure those seeds, because if they are stolen your money can be gone in an instant. Start small first and learn. There is no rush. Bitcoin is about financial sovereignity. As long as you have to login to an exchange to access your bitcoin, it isn't your bitcoin, it's an IOU.

Said it [here](
Freedom is hard, yes. Actually requiring probable cause before being subjected to the justice system used to be a thing. Then the US government started stealing peoples money without ever even charging them with a crime. So now we have crypto. So the government can't do it anymore. "But but but what if they are committing a crime!" they say. Prove it i say. You know. Rule of law. That's what democracies are supposed to be about aren't they?
And that attack on freedom now has crypto as a response. The thing that it is counter-intuitive about crypto, is that the solution to electronic anonymous and censorship resistant money, turned out being record everything forever. When someone can flick a switch and take everything from you, you don't have freedom. When you can access the ledger from anyone, prove that it it is valid, and be able to send your money to anyone, for whatever purpose, you do.
This technology has been developed as a direct response to the insidious and anti-democratic implementation of AML/KYC laws on a global scale over the past 30 years. The extrapolation of these laws, given a long enough timeline, is slavery. Not figurative slavery, actual slavery.
Bitcoin is the technical response to that problem.

What you should probably recognize is that there really isn't a market for over-the-counter transactions of bitcoin yet.   The fees are simply too cheap, and only a small portion of people care about transactions confirming quickly.
If people were actually interested, they'd be testing out and deploying these systems as quickly as they could.  The fact that they're not, should show you that this supposed desire for cheap instant transactions still isn't backed up by the people willing to use it for that purpose.

This wouldn't be that hard to do conceptually.  You'd just have a block height, and any coins that were created before that block-height are one format, and any created after are another format.  As long as the node software was created and tested well, people really wouldn't know nor care.


I use it several times a week with my bitcoin debit card to buy beer at my local.  Beers that, for me, keep on getting cheaper.  So perhaps your flippant understanding of how it works isn't actually reflected in reality, and you should spend some time instead questioning why you think one way, when reality is clearly different than the way you think.

To be totally safe, yes.


Nodes make the system run.  Nodes provide the proof in proof-of-work.  Without nodes, miners can lie to you, and there's nothing you can do about it.  Nodes can also change the proof-of-work algorithm so that other miners can do the work if the current miners feel like they don't want to mine for bitcoin anymore.  Nodes make the system run, because it is the nodes that are paying the miners.


Nodes define consensus, not miners.  What the nodes say is bitcoin is bitcoin.  Unless the existing node users that use those nodes to make bitcoin transactions uninstall their node clients, and install the 2x node client, bitcoin remains bitcoin.


Anyone who wants to run the 2x hard-fork have to change their node from a bitcoin node to a 2x node, not the other way around.  100,000 core reference nodes haven't done this, and won't do this, so if you want to run a shitcoin node, it's a free world, no-one is going to stop you.


If they sell bitcoin as something else, and find out that the thing they bought as bitcoin is actually a shitcoin worth 1/5th the value, they're probably going to be a bit upset about it, yes.  Should have run a bitcoin node then.


That's because you don't understand how bitcoin works.

Your understanding of nakamoto consensus is flawed.  Consensus is about the rule-set that is accepted by the nodes.  Nodes decide what hashing algorithm to adopt, so hashrate of one particular algorithm has no bearing on consensus if the nodes choose not to recognize that algorithm.  Which is why the white-paper refers to the working on **valid** blocks, not the chain with the highest hash-rate.

Definitely not.  They are an exchange.  They sell bitcoin and you can sell bitcoin there.  What you need to understand is that they shouldn't be used for anything other than that.  I definitely wouldn't be buying from them during the fork though.  You could be thinking you're buying bitcion, and they could substitute 2x, valued at about 10% of it, instead.


I would not trust exodus until they are clear about [how they're going to manage the fork.](  At present, you are in great danger of having funds stolen if you transact during the shenanigans of the fork because of their implementation.
I would suggest a light wallet like electrum :
They have clearly stated that they are going to be referencing core nodes, so you know that you will still be using bitcoin.  Your keys from that wallet will still be available to liquidate your 2x coins when it is safe to do so, by importing those keys into a wallet that will probably be developed after the fork.
If you want to be really secure, download [a bitcoin full node]( and use that wallet.  Then you know for sure that you are dealing with bitcoin, and not some cheap alternative that some business want to sell you instead.  It does, however, use a lot of computer resources.

So, like i thought.  You don't understand how lightning works.  You know, I've noticed this as a bit of a trend with you.  You talk a lot, but your understanding of how bitcoin actually works is kinda thin.  So let's talk about lightning for a second.
Lightning allows users to take a single bitcoin transaction, and use it over a finite space of time, in order to shift bitcoin back and forth, with no or vanishingly small transaction fees, as iou's between what are called 'lightning channels'. The actual transaction size will be the same as a normal transaction, with a flag that says it can only be committed to the blockchain at a specific time (or block depth). In effect, these lightning transactions are cryptographically signed 'iou's. The 'thousands' of back-and-forth iou changes are discarded when the channel is closed (massive privacy dividend), and only the aggregated change is committed to the blockchain. This is the great thing about lightning. It is a single transaction with as many inputs and outputs (one/two) as defined in the original transaction. Only the transaction values change.
Consider a channel link of this : John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne. Only the people next to each other in the chain have a 'channel open' with each other (John/Bob, Bob/Sally, Sally/Anne). Assuming each of the channels between all of the participants have adequate funds in order to achieve this, if John wanted to send 1btc to Anne. A transaction ledger would read :
John-&gt;Bob channel : John -1btc, Bob +1btc
Bob-&gt;Sally channel : Bob -1btc, Sally +1btc
Sally-&gt;Anne channel : Sally -1btc, Anne +1btc.
Anne now has 1btc more, and John has 1btc less, but the net effect in each channel is simply a modification to the distribution of bitcoin in that channel.
Imagine this happening, back and forth, and extended to thousands, tens of thousands, and millions of people. As long as there's a chain between them, you use the chain. You might even have your transaction split over multiple chains. For links that don't have a chain, you create a channel on-the-fly.
Each channel, therefore, only ends up with the same single input, and the same two outputs, just differing values.
It's significantly more complex than that (transaction routing, and channel closure mechanics), but that's the idea. I wish I could remember the lightning dev that explained it. It really is very clever. I haven't actually questioned about the effect of having channels with multiple inputs (John/Sally) and outputs (Bob/Anne) at inception. Technically, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible. Just a much weirder set of ramifications.
I would suggest that the method for creating ln channels is most likely :  Carol wants to pay Bob 0.5btc.  She creates a ln channel with 1btc, of which Bob is allocated 0.5btc, and carol is allocated 0.5btc.  Bob gets paid 0.5btc that is accessible once confirmed.  Carol has 0.5btc that is now accessible once confirmed.  That way the ln can be bootstrapped by existing txns.
I'd also suggest that it would be easier to understand if Bob were Bob Inc.  The incentive will be for the buyer to reduce txn fees.  If Carol uses a store (coffee?) she will want to reduce paying those fees.   So she creates a channel with 0.1btc and 0.001 is allocated to Bob Inc. For the coffee she buys today, coffee + txn fee.  Ever more?  Zippo txn fee.   When your channel is almost zero, you buy bitcoin, it is delivered back to you by the rebalancing of that channel. And because it's Bob Inc the path through the channels from a source of bitcoin is reduced, maybe even two hops ( exchangeA/exchangeB -&gt; exchangeB/Bob Inc. -&gt; Bob Inc./Carol).  
So how about you actually start talking about lightning in future, if you actually want to try and criticize it.

My speculative (talking out of my ass) 'position' is that bitcoin is actually sucking the life out of the 'gold as a store of value' market.  Gold will always be valuable regardless.  Its properties are actually quite unique.  But when faced with a product that provides a better store of value because of its privacy, ability to acquire, coupled with the fact that you can transmit it anywhere in the world with negligible effort, the properties that make gold what it costs today, I think, will be decoupled from the asset.

It is critically important, given that there is no replay protection for this fork, that you validate that the coins you have exist distinctly in each chain, before you start to trade them with others.  You have to validate that your bitcoin and 2x transactions haven't been replayed into the other chain.  With the mining shenanigans that can go on, this could take a LOT of confirmations.

Core contributors will probably already understand this in its entirety.  Emergency forks are called emergencies for a reason.  This is an attack.  They have known of this attack vector for years.  The only question they probably have is whether the node users will support a change to a PoW.
It is time to let them know that the bitcoin nodes will adopt the change, and they'll do it for their own survival.
Perhaps we should be signalling our nodes with a "PoW change" signal?

Fair enough.


An 8mb blocksize that 2x provides will make running a node in Australia impossible for almost every consumer internet connection.


Anyone can run a hub.  I don't need to let anyone route through my hub  if i choose not to.  I may choose to only maintain channels with my coffee shop, my grocery store, my pub, my exchange and a couple of vending machines, and unlike bitcoin, every transaction isn't replicated and stored by every hub.  The equivalent bandwidth requirement would be akin to a torrent of a small file that is rarely sought.  If you think that that constitutes  traffic, then you are commenting on the technology without understanding it. 
Would you like for me to explain how lightning works?


That's why it is important to maintain consensus. 


Repeated attempts of a node, which like everyone else is the method of communication between peers, to pass invalid transactions or blocks leads to them being banned by a node.  So they become disconnected from the same peer group, and nodes align around identical consensus rules.  But each of these transactions actually requires people to make valid transactions.
 Which is what this is all about.  So it takes people actually committing bitcoin to an alternate set of consensus rules, and consciously deciding to use alternate consensus rules for all of their transactions, for node owners to decide that they would prefer to transact on that alternate set of consensus rules.  They will then need to physically uninstall their existing node client, and then install the alternate client, with different consensus rules, and use that node client to make bitcoin transactions.   And they hate change. It is this reality that almost every person who supports 2x fails to grasp.

1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis
1 mBTC = 1 millibitcoin = 100,000 satoshis
1 uBTC = 1 microbitcoin = 1.00 bits = 100 satoshis
1 satoshi = 1 satoshi.

Prepare for the storm Slush.  The miners are forcing the hands of 100,000 core reference nodes.  Even 2x abandoned replay protection, so they should expect the same in return. Bitcoin core reference nodes users will not just sit by, and watch miners force them to stop using their nodes. They will change the PoW in order to nullify the attack on them. 
The miners, and a few businesses aligned with them, are forcing the owners of bitcoin to either abandon their nodes, or change the PoW.  There is only one outcome for this.  The PoW needs to change, and nodes should upgrade without replay protection, so that users can let miners know who controls the distribution of bitcoin rewards.

Still keep the keys offline.  Import only the key you want to use into an encrypted node wallet.  Use the node wallet to interact with the blockchain.  Delete the key from the node after completion.
There are other even safer ways to do this like creating the transaction offline and simply using the node to sign it.  But learn that when you have a major stake.   Using your own node to record and validate that transactions have been recorded on the blockchain is the only way you truly know you are using bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:57:28

Incorrect.  Bitcoin has owners : The users.  Node owners define the consensus rules that they agree to use, and through their use of the nodes that enforce those consensus rules, they control bitcoin.  They control bitcoin by making transactions on nodes they control, and agree to only transact with other people that choose to use and enforce the same consensus rules.

most of the existing major devs (e.g. pacia, hoffman) of open bazaar are anti bitcoin, and have been for at least a year.  You'll probably have to wait until someone forks it to create a lightning variant. 
EDIT: To specifically answer your question, yes, there is no doubt that a decentralized solution like OB could benefit from lightning.  But it's going to probably be some time before it can be fully implemented.  Segwit, which lightning as it exists today requires, has only been in production since late last year.  Either OB1 implements lightning in Open Bazaar, or someone forks it and does it instead of them.

If you don't know how to protect yourself from replay attacks, which this fork specifically enables, you shouldn't be touching it.  
The most effective method of having access to it will be to download the btc1 node wallet on a fresh-build, and import the private keys that you have just migrated the funds to, and that are no longer at those addresses in the bitcoin blockchain.  The question is how much of a fail-train 2x is.  Because they're crap developers, and no-one trusts them, and because they're hiding their node signature because everyone wants to disconnect their malicious node, you might find that you're isolated from every other 2x node.  You won't know for sure until you see this cluster-fuck in action.
BUT! Make sure you have a looooot of confirmations for BOTH chains. A miner attacking the network may conspire with exchanges to mine blocks anonymously and then cause a re-org of the chain, where it is not revealed until some length of time, that you have been the victim of a replay attack. I will be waiting several days at least after I've split them into different addresses, before I start shifting around my 2x coins to exchanges so that I can sell them.

It is nothing more than a variation of a man in the middle attack.  If a single person is a victim of a replay attack, the hidden node can legitimately be used as the excuse for its success.

You can't.  Otherwise it won't have met consensus.  You don't have blockchains blockchain.  They have theirs.  If you have theirs, you will have a non-consensus blockchain.  
You are skimming over what I said in the previous post, and you probably shouldn't.  The 'starting at genesis and working your way forward' isn't just a figure of speech.  Every block is sourced and requires a hash of the previous block, which is used to form the hash of the next block.  If at any time there were two separate records of a block, regardless of whether it was fraudulent or not, the hash of the subsequent blocks will be different.  Generating those hashes uses the consensus algorithms, and so does validation.  You can't produce a fraudulent block and build on it.  If you try, every node will reject your transactions and blocks.  Only by going through this process do you arrive at consensus.

I remember learning this. 
Node count, by itself, is immaterial.  What matters is what node people send and accept transactions to/from.  That is why you run a node.  To ensure that consensus rules are enforced on transactions that affect you.  How many eth, ltc, 2x, rippple or bch nodes there are is immaterial, because if they don't meet your node consensus rules, your node rejects them.

@_date: 2017-10-23 05:17:16


I answered this in another thread, but I'll post it here.
Bitcoin is a blockchain, which is a distributed ledger/database.  [Every node]( has a copy of the blockchain.  When you use a light wallet [like electrum]( you are communicating with bitcoin nodes (that you are trusting) that electrum uses to access their copies of the blockchain.  Exchanges will have their own nodes too, but might not even tell you what type of node they are.  When you, or an exchange, writes a transaction by sending someone bitcoin, they attempt to write a ledger entry to their copy of the blockchain.  Their node then places this into a pool of every other transaction that is replicated between the nodes.  Miners then take these transactions from any node, generally by order of miner fee, and orders them in a block, and enters a race performing a hashing function of them (as you get).  If that hashing function meets the node consensus requirements, nodes accept that block, and add it to the blockchain.  They then replicate that block to all of the other nodes, and every node validates every transaction and every block as they receive it.  If it fails for any reason, it is rejected.  Even if every other node says it is ok, it is still rejected, because each node only trusts its own consensus rules.  Every node has performed a validation function on every block since the genesis block, and only trusts the blocks and transactions that it and it alone has validated.  Whichever miner wins the block race gets their block built upon.  Any miner that attempts to add a block to the blockchain that comes after, will find that the other nodes reject that block, because it has already been solved.
An actual [full-node]( requires no middleman and no trust, but as it is communicating with the bitcoin network, it uses bandwidth.  [It is also currently about 140gb]( but you can configure it so that it downloads the blockchain and validates it, but it only keeps what it needs (called [the UTXO]( and discards old blocks that aren't needed anymore, and you get get it down to about 4gb.  You validate your copy of the blockchain, and transactions you make are made to your copy of the blockchain, and that is replicated.
So whether you use a light wallet where you trust someone elses node, or you use your own node, you only ever write to a node, and the bitcoin network takes care of the rest, and miners source transactions, and return blocks based upon those consensus rules.

You don't understand your own point because you still fail to understand how consensus works in bitcoin even after all this time.  You think the 100,000 core reference nodes are just going to give up if a miner attacks the sha256 chain?  Then you'll see the nodes upgrading, but not in the way envisaged. 
If the miners attack the SHA256 chain all the nodes would need to do is upgrade to a new pow chain with no replay protection.  You think the node owners are going to accept that type of ultimatum? Because you don't understand how bitcoin works, and what nodes do you fail at any discussion about adversarial conditions.  The miners have one job : mine.  The only power they have is to decide whether they mine or don't mine.  As soon as they attack they lose everything.

Nodes define consensus in bitcoin, not miners.  What the nodes say is bitcoin, is bitcoin.  Nodes change the PoW and it is all over for the SHA-256 miners.
Miners are like guard dogs. They've been faithful at getting stronger and stronger, and protecting the house. But now they're starting to think they're the owners of the house, and not the guard dog, and are acting like they might attack the owner. So what do you do if your guard dog attacks you? You put him down. Get a new guard dog.

I just don't think the two things (fiat/payments vs store of value) are aligned at present, and for some reason people want them to be.  IMO bitcoin is eating golds lunch as a store of value, and is only beginning to grow into the layer 2 payments network.  Sure, people use it for payments, but it just doesn't have enough of a market impetus.  I think it's actually quite a while before it shifts focus between these things.

That's not really the way it works.  What you can do is use a node.  Your node polices consensus so you know if you use your node for your bitcoin transactions that you are transacting in bitcoin.  Only when there are too many sybil nodes that you can't peer with other bitcoin nodes is it an issue.  It is deliberately difficult to determine consensus for protocol changes.  It's hard to take over because you can't force people to change their node clients, which is what you need to do in order to activate a hard-fork.  Spinning up 10,000 alternate nodes is immaterial if no-one uses those nodes for transacting bitcoin.

Nodes and consensus as defined in the whitepaper and implemented in nodes.
 Let's start with [the bitcoin white paper]( :


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




What does this mean if you are but an intrepid traveler amongst the erstwhile numpty-folk?
Nodes are agents in a multi-agent system with [an agreed set of consensus rules]( which they and they alone enforce, that ensure that the system functions. Transactions are propagated through the multi-agent network based upon the agreed consensus rules by nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Miners retrieve valid transactions from any of these nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then order the transactions, and perform a hashing function on them until the hashing function returns a value that is suitable to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then pass the new block that they've created to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. The nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, then validate the block to ensure that each of the transactions within the block agree with the consensus rules. Then the node, which is an agent in a multi-agent system, extends the block-chain by attaching the new block to it.  They then pass the new block, if it is valid, to other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Then each of these other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, each do the same validation on every block.
Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node extends the blockchain.  Miners don't.  The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.  It is the validation of the nodes, and their CPU's, that define and police consensus in bitcoin.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, validate the transactions (using their CPU), replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks (using their CPU), extend the blockchain (using their CPU), replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.  If you can't convince these node owners that are using their node on a day-to-day basis, to uninstall their node software and install your new node client, especially when that node client decreases their node security and decreases the network security, any change you have is going to go exactly nowhere.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.  If you can't convince all of those node owners running their node clients to uninstall one client and re-install another, any change you have to consensus is DOA.

- Blocks may only create a certain number of bitcoins. (Currently 12.5 BTC per block.)
- Transactions must have correct signatures for the bitcoins being spent.
- Transactions/blocks must be in the correct data format.
- Within a single block chain, a transaction output cannot be double-spent.






1. The transactions syntax and data structure are correct.
2. The input and outputs have values.
3. The transaction is less than the block size of 1 MB.
4. The values must be more than 0 and less than 21 million.
5. None of the inputs have a hash that is equal to 0.
6. The locktime is less than the maximum allowed number.
7. The transaction size is greater than or equal to 100 bytes.
8. The number of signatures is less than the signatute limit.
9. The unlocking script can only push numbers onto the stack.
10. The locking script must match isstandard format.
11. A matching transaction must exist.
12. If a transaction is missing move the transaction to the orphan transaction pool.
13. If the transaction is a coinbase transaction then it must have a maturity of 100 confirmations.
14. For each input the output must exist and not have been spent.
15. Check that each input value is in the required range.
16. Reject if the input value is less than the output value.
17. Reject if the transaction value is to low to get into an empty block.
18. The unlocking scripts for each input must be verified against the output locking scripts.

Freedom is hard, yes. Actually requiring probable cause before being subjected to the justice system used to be a thing. Then your government started stealing peoples money without ever even charging them with a crime. So now we have crypto. So people like you can't do that anymore.  "But but but what if they are committing a crime!" you say. Prove it i say. You know. Rule of law. That's what democracies are supposed to be about aren't they?
And that attack on freedom now has crypto as a response. The thing that it is counter-intuitive about crypto, is that the solution to electronic anonymous and censorship resistant money, turned out being record everything forever. When someone can flick a switch and take everything from you, you don't have freedom. When you can access the ledger from anyone, prove that it it is valid, and be able to send your money to anyone, for whatever purpose, you do.
This technology has been developed as a direct response to the insidious and anti-democratic implementation of AML/KYC laws on a global scale over the past 30 years. The extrapolation of these laws, given a long enough timeline, is slavery. Not figurative slavery, actual slavery.
Bitcoin is the technical response to that problem.

Cryptography without crypto-currency is simply a digital token ; A cryptographic signature with censorship resistance, i.e. government,  which allows them to change or override the cryptographic proof, for political reasons.  It's like a key to a hotel room.  Sure, only that key with that signature, can open that lock.  But the hotel can always make another key.   
Therefore, government crypto is an oxymoron.

 Core can't get me to install that updated node client. That's what you guys fail to understand.  It is what the nodes choose to run that defines bitcoin.  Currently that is a core reference client because they write software that people want to use.  As soon as they stop doing that, people will stop using their node client.

Without users running nodes, no-one wants or uses their coin.  You really don't understand bitcoin if you don't understand the role that nodes play in consensus.  Explain to me how using a closed-system that only they control will provide more benefit to users such that they choose to use that system over a system that they control?  If they wanted that, they'd use the existing financial system.

I have no desire to see, nor do I think there is any real likelihood, of a crash.  I don't think bitcoin requires that to establish itself in its use-case.  It is the disruption of banking, in that it doesn't require regulatory oversight for anyone to manage and distribute wealth.  
I said this elsewhere recently :
Freedom is hard. Actually requiring probable cause before being subjected to the justice system used to be a thing. Then the US government started stealing peoples money without ever even charging them with a crime. So now we have crypto. So the government can't do it anymore. "But but but what if they are committing a crime!" they say. Prove it i say. You know. Rule of law. That's what democracies are supposed to be about aren't they?
And that attack on freedom now has crypto as a response. The thing that it is counter-intuitive about crypto, is that the solution to electronic anonymous and censorship resistant money, turned out being record everything forever. When someone can flick a switch and take everything from you, you don't have freedom. When you can access the ledger from anyone, prove that it it is valid, and be able to send your money to anyone, for whatever purpose, you do.
This technology has been developed as a direct response to the insidious and anti-democratic implementation of AML/KYC laws on a global scale over the past 30 years. The extrapolation of these laws, given a long enough timeline, is slavery. Not figurative slavery, actual slavery.
Bitcoin is the technical response to that problem.

As a system to securely manage transactions between participating banks, i could definitely see a market for it.  They could make it as open or as closed as they like.  They could even implement theft prevention measures.  All of the exposure to bitcoin, but less of the risk (for them).   They could even implement aml/kyc.  Or integrate only their chain with a payment processor like visa. 
For me?  Hell no.  But for many people, it could be a way to leverage themselves into the crypto space using the only crypto that can provide the back end security.

I say :
You are thinking of the store of value property without the cryptographic property that secures it. You are talking about it as one would talk about valuable shells, and even shell sellers, and not the security that separates it from all forms of value exchange before it. To understand the intrinsic value of bitcoin it is good to use the analogy of an envelope. So i ask you : does an envelope have intrinsic value?
If I have a letter that I need to send securely, would I prefer to send it open, and ready to be read? Or would I prefer for it to be sent within the confines of an envelope. Now let's think... would I prefer to just leave an open envelope, or would I think it necessary to put some seal across it to ensure that it isn't opened, and read whilst en-route. Does a sealable envelope have more intrinsic value than an unsealable one? Hmm... but what if someone can counterfeit the seal? I need some method of ensuring that the message I want to get to that person isn't read, and preferably, isn't even identified as a message. That's when you need to get lawyers involved. Sounds expensive. There's obviously something intrinsically valuable about such a service, because many people pay oh-so-very-much money for it.
Now let's imagine we're not talking about letters, we're talking about money. Would you address a $100 note through the mail to your child for their birthday? You'd pay for a stamp at least. Would you encase it in an envelope that you paid for at the local post-shop? Hmm... bill in the envelope. Perhaps encase it in a card? What if it is $1000? $10,000? Does the protection service of an envelope somehow decrease because the value of the contents of the package increases? It's the opposite, isn't it?  Bitcoin is both the cryptographically sealed envelope, and the network to deliver it. 
What say you? Is an envelope intrinsically valuable?

This malicious solution is AIDS.
echo "Mallory opens a payment channel to Alice requiring either a 2-of-2 sig or 1 sig after a CLTV/CSV timeout.  Alice's software dosen't know about the consensus-blacklisted address, so it doesn't barf when Mallory makes an in-channel payment to Alice that refunds the remainder to the blacklisted address.  When Alice goes to close the channel, she can't because of the blacklist, so Mallory is able to claim the CLTV/CSV/nLocktime refund." | sha256sum
In more detail:
Mallory opens a payment channel for 1.0 bitcoins to Alice by paying a
2-of-2 multisig P2SH address controlled by both Mallory and Alice.  In
addition to the multisig, the address script has an OP_CLTV or OP_CSV
timeout which allows Mallory to get his 1.0 bitcoins back with just his
signature after an expiration time if a transaction from Alice isn't
confirmed prior to the expiration. 
Mallory then pays Alice in the channel by providing one signature for a
transaction that gives Alice (say) 0.1 BTC and refunds 0.9 BTC to an
address of Mallory's choosing; Alice can then wait hours or days to see 
if Mallory wants to make additional in-channel payments before she 
provides the other signature and broadcasts the transaction.
Normally when Mallory signs the in-channel transaction, he would take 
his 0.9 BTC refund to an address he controls, but as an attack he
chooses the S2X blacklisted address instead.
Alice's software doesn't know about the S2X address (because it's a
valid P2SH address in sane Bitcoin implementations) so the software 
doesn't notice that there's a problem until Alice tries to close the
channel and miners are unable to mine Alice's transaction.  At that 
point, it's too late for Alice to do anything.  The expiration time then
passes and Mallory (at his leisure) is able to spend the whole 1.0
bitcoins wherever he would like.  Alice has lost whatever bitcoins she
legitimately received through the payment channel.

I am using it.  As a store of value.  There are a few minor payments that I use, and I have a bitcoin backed debit card so it's pretty seamless, but that's its primary purpose.


In about six weeks, bitpay, if they follow through with their plans, will no longer be a bitcoin company, but a 2x company.


I reckon it's a good idea not to make comment on what people want without actually validating whether that is true or not.  For the record, I already pay for my VPN using [a different plug-in]( that accepts about ~~15~~ 70 different alts.


The main reason people use bitcoin is because of the depth of its decentralization, as implemented in the 100,000+ validating nodes that people actually use.  This means that bitcoin can't be captured, and your payments, regardless of where they go, or for what purpose, can't be censored.


Not really interested in alts except as a hedge against issues with bitcoin.

But it does close out this attack vector.  Even when businesses conspire with miners, they still fail.  I'm not even sure how much longer bitmain can maintain their dominance without asicboost.  There is not guarantee they're no bleeding money. This whole thing smacks of desperation.

I would not be surprised to see a correlation.  There is certainly a lot of hype around bitcoin.  But what I see in bitcoin, is that the people who arrive and take the time to understand it, don't actually leave it.  If they did, after the 2013/2014 Mt.Gox hack, bitcoin would never have recovered.  What we found is that the people who lost and were into it before simply wrote off the losses and re-committed to the technology.

As long as they don't attack the bitcoin chain, then they can call it funbux for all i care.  If they attack the bitcoin chain, we get a pow change, so you have a choice of downgrading your security to a miner controlled centralized 2x coin by running a btc1 node, or upgrading your node to v0.16 and use a decentralized bitcoin chain.  Choose wisely. 
I'm hoping they do attack it. I want the miners to permanently learn the consequences of trying to coerce bitcoin users into adopting their consensus rules.  They will be crushed.  This showdown needs to happen sooner or later.  I can't think of a better time than now.

 hey dude, i get where you're coming from.  I can see, from a certain perspective, this is bad not just for bitmain, but for lots of potential players in the future.  But this is reality.  there are some things you can change, and some you can't.  
Bitcoin isn't yours any more than it is mine. It is what it is, and people will use it whichever way they see fit.  If they wanna use the law, they will.  If they want to cheat, they will.  Bitcoin isn't about protecting or sheltering businesses or anyone from anything.  It's about allowing you to protect your wealth. 
What bitcoin stands for is people protecting their interests through  the consensus of the peers; the nodes. As long as that works, bitcoin works for what it's about.  If you come up with a proposal that is better than now, make a BIP.  If it is better, consensus will adopt it.

Nodes employ miners to undertake hashing work according to bitcoin consensus rules that the nodes police, and then validate whether the work was undertaken.  So it is nodes that provide the 'proof' in 'proof-of-work'.

 The fact that you don't know this, is the reason why you fail. 
The only thing that matters is what node is used to send, and more importantly receive, transactions.  The count is only superficially aligned with consensus, because if you aren't using your node for recording blockchain transactions, you aren't enforcing consensus, so your node doesn't really matter, no matter how many of them you have.

decentralized anonymous cryptocurrency Monero. Similar to Bitcoin, Monero is a
cryptocurrency which is distributed through a proof of work “mining” process.
The original Monero protocol was based on CryptoNote, which uses ring
signatures and one-time keys to hide the destination and origin of transactions.
**Recently the technique of using a commitment scheme to hide the amount of a
transaction has been discussed and implemented by Bitcoin Core Developer
Gregory Maxwell.** In this article, a new type of ring signature, A Multi-layered
Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signature is described which allows for
hidden amounts, origins and destinations of transactions with reasonable
efficiency and verifiable, trustless coin generation. Some extensions of the
protocol are provided, such as Aggregate Schnorr Range Proofs, and Ring
Multisignature. The author would like to note that early drafts of this were
publicized in the Monero Community and on the bitcoin research irc channel.
Blockchain hashed drafts are available in [14] showing that this work was started
in Summer 2015, and completed in early October 2015. An eprint is also
available at

Python is a cool language, but it is no substitute for ~~higher~~lower level languages.   It's great if you want to deploy something, or want to glue together different parts of systems.  If you do a one off processing task, and speed isn't the highest priority, python is great.  Python for testing is also extremely powerful.  
Bitcoin is mostly coded in c++, which allows you to easily port it, and more importantly compile it, on many different os'.   
The only real criticism of c# is that it is entirely Microsoft centric. They have done some things around the edges, but it is still the case.  But many corporate environments are wintel and SharePoint houses, and have no intention of changing, so there is still a lot of development there.

There is consensus for a PoW change if the 100,000 core reference nodes become obsolete because bitmain attacks the SHA-256 algorithm that bitcoin uses if they don't adopt another PoW.


Only as long as bitcoin nodes control consensus, which they won't when nodes of BCH and 2x are the only permissable chains of the SHA-256 algorithm.
That is why a PoW change needs to be done now.

It isn't possible for miners to be as stupid as you, because they know that they could lose their entire infrastructure investment.  Go your separate ways if you are so inclined.  Enjoy your alt.   another sha-256 alt isn't going to really be an issue. 
Ah, but if miners choose to attack the bitcoin chain, that's when we get fireworks!  Can't see it though.  They're not as stupid  as you.  So you fork off to your alt, and lose what's left of your money after fail train  bch cleaned out most of ya.
I do hope they are as stupid as you though.  The humiliating smack down of the miners will be so epic no miner will ever attempt the shenanigans again.  Bitcoin price will skyrocket.

It is critically important  at first to learn how to use a light wallet like electrum.  Start with learning how to transfer small amounts.   You should learn how to store your seeds and wallets, delete your wallets, and reinstate them from the seeds.  You need to safely secure those seeds, because if they are stolen your money can be gone in an instant.  Start  small first and learn.  There is no rush.  Bitcoin is about financial sovereignity. As long as you have to login to an exchange to access your bitcoin, it isn't your bitcoin, it's an IOU.

You're thinking too much into it.  It doesn't matter what people call something.  That's the great invention of bitcoin.  You run your node, and you know you are using bitcoin.  You don't have to trust anyone.  That's the point.  If they want to say that it is something that it isn't, your node sets the record straight.  Miners attack the chain, and the node just gets patched to only validate a different hashing algorithm.  bye bye attacking miners.
Run your node.  Be prepared to update with the patch that looks like it is coming.  If the miners attack, they get crushed.  If exchanges change their nodes to non-bitcoin and tell you it's bitcoin, they get crushed.  As long as you run your node, and use your node to validate your bitcoin transactions, you will know you're using bitcoin, regardless of what anyone else says.  You run a node to ensure you're not having to trust miners, exchanges, or other assorted shysters and charlatans.

Que?  It is no such thing, and the price of bitcoin reflects that.  Bitcoin users aren't selling their bitcoin, in case you hadn't noticed.  Because the people who hold bitcoin, and use their nodes, know that if the miners attack the SHA-256 chain, they get crushed.  Swiftly.  The only thing protecting SHA-256 miners from getting crushed right now is the fact that they haven't attacked the chain.  
Please please please.  Please attack the chain.  I want this to be a permanent lesson to miners where they stand in the pecking order.  Render the SHA-256 algorithm useless for bitcoin, and the nodes will simply adopt a new mining algorithm, and that is the end of these miners.  You won't even know the name bitmain in a year.

There is at least one core dev, and probably more, that is just begging for a justification to change the pow.  If the miners attack the sha256 bitcoin chain, they might get a hard-fork alright, but it won't be the one they were expecting.  And the SHA256 chain will suffer the same trajectory as BCH for exactly the same reason.  They will be crushed, and lose themselves and every other SHA256 miner hundreds of millions of dollars.

It's getting to the point of no return.  There are a couple of large centralized businesses that want to control your access to the blockchain, and they are in a consortium with miners to seal that process.  But they don't control bitcoin, because they don't control the 100,000 core reference nodes that police and control consensus in bitcoin.  The nodes that define the very algorithm that miners must employ, so that nodes will award them bitcoin rewards.
The miners are forcing the hands of 100,000 core reference nodes. Even 2x abandoned replay protection, so they should expect the same in return. Bitcoin core reference nodes users will not just sit by, and watch miners force them to stop using their nodes. They will change the PoW in order to nullify the attack on them, and it is trivially easy for them to do so.
The miners, and a few businesses aligned with them, are forcing the owners of bitcoin to either abandon their nodes, or change the PoW. There is only one outcome for this. The PoW needs to change, and nodes should upgrade without replay protection, so that users can let miners know who controls the distribution of bitcoin rewards.

I used to think BTCC was one of these 'good' miners.
The 'good' miners are few and far between.  They could have pulled back from the cliff over the past two months by not signalling 2x, and they have not.  It is a simple sad fact of life that the good miners have been overwhelmed by the attackers.
We have the moral high-ground.  Nodes have not adopted the 2x node client, and yet miners, and a few centralized businesses are forcing through their change anyway, which will render 100,000 core reference nodes obsolete.
It is time to accept the fact that the attacking miners are the ones in control of the SHA-256 algorithm.  Even if they weren't attacking they're not owed fealty.  But now that any goodwill that any miners had has been extinguished, it is time to finally accept the fact that the SHA-256 algorithm needs to be retired, and a new bitcoin mining algorithm adopted.

Bitcoin isn't a democracy.  You run your node in the configuration you think best suits your needs.  It doesn't matter how much someone squeals.

Reckon you have a good understanding of the macro, but there is something that isn't quite right, and is the most common failing of peoples understanding of bitcoin.  I used to have it too.  It doesn't matter how many nodes there are.  The only thing that matters is what node a person uses in order to record transactions on the blockchain.  
There are 100,000 or so core reference nodes.  Many of these are non-listening, and indeed only started, synched and used when the user wants to record a transaction.   In order to get them to agree to a change, you effectively have to get them all to change.  There are hundreds of people who still use 0.8 nodes.  You think they're going to 'upgrade' to a node client written by one guy that reduces their security?  You think these people aren't bitcoin holders?  The only world in which those users update their node clients is if a miner attacks the sha256 chain, because it renders their node ineffective.  So like every other node user, they will migrate to a different PoW and continue on as they did before, with all of the other nodes doing the same.  bye bye sha256 PoW.
So perceptions only matter in a very very long-term sense.  What actually matters is the technical implementation of consensus through nodes.

I think you're over-thinking it.  It will be amazingly quick if the miners attack the bitcoin SHA-256 chain.  Core will release the update, having selected a block for activation, and then there will be a frantic effort to activate miners of that algorithm.  It will be a bonanza for anyone wanting to earn a bit of bitcoin in the mining game again.  Then the choice is :
1. Upgrade your node to 0.16 with new PoW
2. Uninstall your node, and ever use bitcoin again.
3. Downgrade your node to the 2x node client, accept that they will increase the blocksize until you can't run a node anymore, and then complete with option 2.
There is really only one choice.  Upgrade your node, and continue on your merry way, or cease validating the blockchain.  It won't even be a difficult choice.  I'm hoping that they do attack the SHA-256 chain so that this can be realized.

It has long been my position that the rise of crypto is as a response to the insidious and anti-democratic implementation of AML/KYC regulations.  If the US, the country that is behind forcing all countries to adopt them, actually cared about terrorism funding, they'd stop funding it.  Bitcoin is the technical response to that theft of freedom.  The laws were only ever about control, where supposedly free people went from being innocent until proven guilty, to guilty until you can prove you are innocent.
Over the next 10 years, i expect those laws to become increasingly irrelevant. All they'll do is stop people wanting to use banks.

All these numpties always trying to convince people not to run nodes. 
The only thing that matters is what node is used to send, and more importantly receive, transactions. The count is only superficially aligned with consensus, because if you aren't using your node for recording blockchain transactions, you aren't enforcing consensus, so your node doesn't really matter, no matter how many of them you have.

After the 2x fork, your core reference node will not work anymore, and given the attacking miners already control enough hashpower to completely disable the remaining miners, your nodes will effectively cease being functioning bitcoin nodes as soon as the 2x fork activates.
We need to accept the fact that the SHA-256 hashing algorithm is no longer an effective tool to secure the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:41:16
Like I said, given the choice, I think users would choose to prove once and for all that miners need to stop thinking they can dictate consensus rules, because it would invariably only need to be done once.  Miners would never attempt the threat or attack again.
Realistically, I can't see it happening, true.  Unless the miners attack the SHA-256 chain.  If they do, I would hope and expect that the PoW change proposal would be both swift and final.  Do you side with the bitcoin network, or do you side with miners that control you forever?  It's not really much of a choice, and I wouldn't expect any node user or holder to choose anything other than the updated consensus rules.  It'd be a completely different hashing algorithm, so there's no way you can say one has more hashpower than the next, except that any new PoW will likely have shorter difficulty resets during the bonanza, and therefore would be the longer chain.
But it's all a bit of a moot point right now methinks.
@_date: 2017-10-29 03:10:12

More bullshit.  Bitcoin being taken over by business people like you, so you can be [rent-seekers]( is exactly the opposite reason for its existence.  You wanna subsidize YOUR bitcoin transactions, you can use YOUR money for it, or use YOUR crypto that better suits YOUR business, YOUR shareholder, and YOUR investor needs.

I view the SHA256 algorithm as a requirement placed by nodes on miners for them to undertake, which is validated by those nodes, if they want to earn bitcoin for their work.  It is the NODES that provide the PROOF by validating the block according to consensus rules.  Otherwise it's just work.

What are the best options these days for an alternate algorithm?  [Cuckoo?](  No need to set a difficulty target, just let it sort itself out.  With that happening, it'll be the chain that SPV wallets follow, because it'll take about ten minutes for the difficulty re-target.

You want me to tell you a little secret?  Lots of people cry and whinge that they want this functionality, but not enough people use it even when given the opportunity.  I know this from first hand experience.  It is my opinion that bitpay is bleeding money, which is the only reason they are now in bed with bitmain.  Bitcoin doesn't need middlemen, but the shysters always want to find some way to tax you for things you can do yourself.   
Do i think bitcoin is going to muscle in on that market?  Yep.  But it is years away, and the reality is that bitcoin no confirmation transactions are totally unsuited to that use case.  So the fact is, it is going to need lightning or something that provides exactly the same functionality.  Betting against lightning would be foolhardy in my opinion though. 
Anyone who doesn't recognise these things is just blowing hot air. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:22:35

They validate blocks and transactions.


Yeah.  They do.  Miner produces block with double-spend?  Rejected in validation by every node.  That's what nodes do.  Validate.
1. The transactions syntax and data structure are correct.
2. The input and outputs have values.
3. The transaction is less than the block size of 1 MB.
4. The values must be more than 0 and less than 21 million.
5. None of the inputs have a hash that is equal to 0.
6. The locktime is less than the maximum allowed number.
7. The transaction size is greater than or equal to 100 bytes.
8. The number of signatures is less than the signatute limit.
9. The unlocking script can only push numbers onto the stack.
10. The locking script must match isstandard format.
11. A matching transaction must exist.
12. If a transaction is missing move the transaction to the orphan transaction pool.
13. If the transaction is a coinbase transaction then it must have a maturity of 100 confirmations.
14. **For each input the output must exist and not have been spent.**
15. Check that each input value is in the required range.
16. Reject if the input value is less than the output value.
17. Reject if the transaction value is to low to get into an empty block.
18. The unlocking scripts for each input must be verified against the output locking scripts.

If the nodes change their software, that's the end of the story.  Because the nodes define the consensus, they can.  The remaining node owners get to decide whether they want to be owned by the miners, or whether they actually want to still remain users.  The holders decide whether they are more likely to be able to realize their money with the miners that now control the nodes, or to continue on in the system that led to their being holders in the first place.


And then they would become holders, and users would no longer trust them for the reasons already stated.  The only thing they game-theory-wise would do, would be to instate a pow.

It is not the people who run their own core reference nodes that will be the victims of replay attacks.  It is people who don't use their own nodes (like bitpay merchants) that will.   They will think they are getting paid in bitcoin, but bitpay will pay them 2x instead, and pocket the bitcoin.

With 85%, they can commit 16% to nullify all of the 15% of miners and therefore all transactions, and still have 69% hashing for the 2x chain.
That's what a 51% attack does.  It kills the algorithm.  That's why it needs to be retired.
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:34:24
Node users resist change.  Unless the miners attack, they will "wait-it-out" until the profit of mining justifies miners mining the bitcoin chain.  Miners will earn about 1/10th the amount of money mining the shitcoins that they'll earn mining bitcoin.  But it's a free world.  If they want to do that, that's their prerogative.
But if they follow through on the attack... that means the nodes have no choice, and have to adopt a PoW that punishes them for forcing them to upgrade their software.  The miners will have exactly zero to say in the matter.
Miner choices are : Mine bitcoin and make money, mine shitcoins and lose money, or attack bitcoin and get crushed.

Once this fork dies though, there will be no incentive to spam the chain.  All soft-forks will be via flag-day.  It is my opinion that the retail payment infrastructure is tiny.

@_date: 2017-10-21 05:30:28


Wow.  You really don't know how bitcoin works.  cool.
Every single node validates every single block and every single transaction to ensure that every single block and every single transaction satisfies bitcoin consensus rules.  When your node "sync's" to the network, it downloads every single block and every single transaction and stores those transactions in the blockchain that it and it alone trusts as validated.  So every single node knows that only they have the source of truth.   
When a node is offline, and comes back online again, it queries the network for the current blockchain, and the blockchain that it starts to validate is the longest blockchain.  It then picks up where it let off, and then validates every single block and every single transaction until it independently arrives at the current block.
So when you query a node, you query your copy of the blockchain, that the node houses, that was independently validated.


There is another concept in here called the mempool, but that is independent to the blockchain.  That is the 'cache' that you place transactions in.  Each node validates every single transaction that they place in their mempools to ensure that it satisfies bitcoin consensus rules.  Miners take transactions from that pool (which every full-node has) and then hashes a block with the transactions (or none) that they select.  They then send that block with those transactions back to the nodes.  Each and every node then validates that the block and the transactions that were produced by that miner are valid according to bitcoin consensus rules.
That's bitcoin.  That's how it works.

Because some people are waving around knives (i.e. miners), and being told that if they don't put the knives away, they're going to get shot by the people carrying all of the guns and all of the bullets.  And yet they continue to wave their knives around.  
The only real question is whether the miners are going to attack the bitcoin chain.  If they do, that's a PoW change because it has to be, and once that trigger has been pulled, it's all over for the SHA-256 miners.  Bitcoin node users have a choice of patching their core reference node, turning off their nodes forever because they don't work anymore, or installing the 2x node client.  Emergency patch for block after next difficulty reset with new PoW.  You've got a couple of weeks to get your mining rigs ready, and it's glory days again.  The bitcoin chain mines to the first difficulty reset in about 15 minutes so it immediately becomes 2000 or so blocks longer.  For that time-frame I wouldn't recommend making any transactions, and seeing as how short it would be, it wouldn't make any difference anyway.  All SPV wallets that only validate to chain length follow bitcoin.  Put in opt-in replay protection if you want.  
Imagine how many people are going to immediately recognize that a new mining aglorithm leads to people being able to mine again, at least for a short while.

So am i. Once you lose decentralization, you never get it back. 


Thats the twisted fkn logic you have settled on for blocking scalability then?  Blocking segwit is blocking scalability.  We now see that it was never the real issue for you numpties. 


No i didn't.   Just stop blocking scalability.  Then everyone wins.

The US cannot be trusted, as snowden, the TPP, the 'war on drugs', the invasion of iraq, the creation of alqeda, and wikileaks have demonstrated. They lie, they cheat, they steal, they kill, and they are the largest funders and enablers of terrorism in the world.
The last time there was a military engagement between the US and russia, it was the [US invading russia]( Iran had its democratically elected government overthrown by a US/UK [funded and planned coup]( that directly killed thousands and indirectly killed tens of thousands by the puppet governments US trained death squads (i.e. [SAVAK]( for decades. Saudi Arabia only exists because the US supports it. The entire premise of alqeda is and was to force the US out of Saudi Arabia.

[This]( spells out the bandwidth requirement as of today, with 1mb blocks.  0.373Mbps at the very least.  SegWit will take it to 4x that (and fix malleability, of course).  That link will help clarify some of those assumptions of yours.
So a full SegWit block(+witness data) will be 4x 0.373Mbps = 1.478.  Increase the block size by 2x, and that becomes 2.956.  Two years later, with unlimited, that gets increased to 5.912Mpbs.
**at the very least**

Segwit existed as a solution to a problem in the years preceding that shitfight.  The only thing that 2x did was crystallize the understanding that the users control this ecosystem, not the parasitic businesses that try to speak for it.  What it proved was that the users were prepared to burn the entire thing to the ground rather than to hand it over to people like you and your ilk.  And the smartest amongst you blinked.

Segwit fixes transaction malleability, which enables lightning.  That's the only viable scaling solution worth considering.  Funny how the rbtc numpties are now blocking the scaling of bitcoin eh?  It kind of makes you wonder if they were ever concerned with scaling at all, doesn't it?

Bitcoins are packages of spent energy.  People who buy bitcoin buy utility and security, and that is facilitated by spending money on energy for mining.  Bitcoin is a service that people are willing to pay for.  Its unique value-proposition is that it is trustless, relying upon selfish miners to facilitate this utility and security.

It doesn't matter what core will do.  What bitcoin users will do is use the exchanges that trade in bitcoin, and the value of those exchanges will increase, and the value of the 2x exchanges will crater, because no-one will be willing to use those exchanges, except to sell their 2x tokens.
People don't need exchanges to move bitcoin.  That's the point.  That's what bitcoin is.  You use your node, and you circumvent the attackers, because you control your value by using your node.

American?  My favorite artist is Mat Zo, and he isn't American at all.


Err.. no.  EDM as it stands today, comes more from Europe than it does from america.  It has its origins in classical music, not disco.  It is only recently that there have been any electronic artists worth mentioning from the US, and none of the history of Armin Van Buuren, The Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, Paul Oakenfold or Tiesto.  And I'm not particularly a fan of Tiesto, either.  Don't get me wrong, I like DJ Shadow, but EDM as it is today was introduced to the US, not the other way around.  It is now changing again because of the US influence, but that is a relatively recent thing.

What now?  I know there's a difference between investing and speculating, as I've repeatedly stated.  What you've just done there is yet another logical fallacy, the straw-man. That might work with the idiots that you hang around with, but it doesn't with me.  That's the second logical fallacy you've used in two comments with me. Perhaps you should be availing yourself of some critical thinking subjects in your university?
You need to start putting those supposed qualifications to good use.  If you have a hypothesis, like "bitcoin is a ponzi scheme" or "Most bitcoin payments are illegal", both of which are statements you have made, collect data, analyze the data, and publish it.  Right now, you just sound like a senile old git that is finding it difficult to deal with change, and whingeing because no one listens to you.

Hey dude, I understand the difference.  I think you can make a speculative investment as well.  Real-estate has been a successful one for many years, up until the 2007 crash.  I personally don't see anything wrong with either, you just need to understand what each one is.
If people want to speculate on bitcoin, good on em.  If people want to use it for its utility, good on em.  If people want to invest in mining hardware, good on em.  If people don't want to have anything to do with bitcoin, good on em.  Different people spend their money in different ways.

bahaha... 6x higher than any ADSL2 connection available in Australia.  So... your upload bandwidth, which is the actual constraint of running a node, is anything but "run-of-the-mill".  SegWit is already likely to push it to a minimum requirement of 1.2Mbps (and that's absolute minimum), and a variable block-size, as is proposed with Unlimited will push it past your internet bandwidth threshold within about two years.

It'll be much harder for bitcoin to devalue, as there are coins that can't be sold.  Unlike a number of other cryptos that have big holders that can liquidate at any moment, bitcoin still has large holders, but will never have the number of holders that can liquidate.

Oh look! Another rbtc numpty that doesn't know how bitcoin works!
Nodes define consensus in bitcoin numpty.  Nodes are nodes.  Nodes validate.  All of them do.  It's what they do.


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




Nodes are the agents in a multi-agent system enforcing consensus.
Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, validate the transactions, replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks, replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.

You reckon a house isn't a store of wealth?  What do you reckon the total value of all real estate in the world is?
There are 58000 dwellings in my home city alone.  The median house price is USD$500,000.  that means in my city ago alone the wealth stored in residential housing is 28 billion.  That doesn't include government, commercial, public, utilities, or anything else.  Just residential housing.

He's arguing that the entire derivative market is a ponzi scheme.
Once you know this, you know how to dismantle his argument.  He's not saying that bitcoin is somehow special, he's saying that ALL speculative investments are ponzi schemes.  By his definition 90% of global trade is a ponzi scheme.  It demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of trade.

No.  No.  I don't trust you.  You never informed me of the requirement to provide you this information before you took my money.  I want my money back.  It finally got to threats before they reversed the transaction, which is about the dodgiest way that that could be done too.

Probably not.  Imagine the price of a product is 115.  Then imagine you have an exchange, where a bunch of people have 'buy' orders on a product, ranging through these values : 
- 5 @ 115
- 7 @ 114
- 8 @ 113
- 10 @ 112
- 15 @ 111
 
- 25 @ 110
... and some guy comes along, and says, I've got 25 lots to sell.  Who's gonna buy em?  You work your way down the list (5 + 7 + 8 + 5 of the guy @ 112, which makes 25) and the new price is 112, because all of the buy orders have been closed out at that sell.
So what probably happened, is just some guy said 'let me sell a bunch of coins', and closed out all of the positions up until that point, promptly filled, with a new orientation around the new value.
That's how an exchange works.

I solve this problem pretty easily.  I use an electrum wallet, that has a multi-sig address.  I move coins on the electrum wallet to one of the sig addresses.  I then direct mycelium to use that address.  
I can then send/receive on my phone through mycellium, but if I lost my phone, I can still send/receive from my electrum wallet.  That electrum wallet is stored in a true-crypt volume, and off-site.  Even if there was a fire at my house, or if I lost my phone, I'd still have access to my bitcoin.

Yes you can.  Only one party needs to commit bitcoin to the txn.  That would be the person committing to the exchange of funds.  If no channel already exists, this is exactly how it would be created.


Yes.  Like every other bitcoin transaction.  Which, if you look at the actual point of this thread, can be acted upon via zero-conf transactions, or whatever risk profile, that the participants to the txn are prepared to accept.


Which I didn't say.

You're the one that is failing to grasp political science sunshine, not me.  Americans, as a rule, don't understand it, because of the failing education system that perpetuated myths and memes as a result of the cold-war.  Which is why most americans (like you) don't know the difference between communism and socialism, or indeed, that they (americans) practice socialism extensively.   Those deeply held beliefs are a product of your american media and political discourse, and its complete lack of understanding, and demonization, of soviet russia.
So, because of this lack of critical thinking skills, I'm going to introduce you to another concept, to help you get over this intellectual hurdle.  It's called ['cognitive dissonance'](  This problem occurs when your deeply held beliefs are not reflected in reality, and when confronted with evidence that contradicts your beliefs, you refuse to recognize reality.  




That's the thing you're going through.  Because you lack critical thinking skills, you are incapable of recognizing that your 'understanding' of socialism is inconsistent with its wide-spread implementation.  You 'think' (if you can call it that) that your 'understanding' of socialism is based in fact, and when you are confronted with the reality that your 'understanding' is woefully inadequate, you attempt of discount the reality, as if by not believing it, the knowledge will change.
I blame the atrocious american education system.  You can blame the baby-boomers for that if that makes you happy.

No.  That isn't how it works.  
You QA and QC your code with appropriate experts, and they provide advice on what needs to be done to sort out the problems of your code, then you do that, then you develop a test-suite that looks for all of the edge cases of your implementation, then you implement it in a test environment, then you look for discrepancies between your expected outcomes and actual outcomes, then you review discrepancies for code change requirements, then you implement the code changes.  Then you go through this entire process again and again until your edge cases are removed, and then you build a 'release candidate', and get a larger group of people to test that, and then you make the changes that are necessary to get it to work correctly.  Then you build another release candidate, and keep doing that until all of the issues are resolved.  Then you deploy it.
What you don't do is say "fuck it, release it and see if it breaks.  Someone else will find out if it fucks up."

And more money to be earned by miners because more transactions can be placed in blocks.  With fees now at a point where that means a serious financial advantage the incentive for the miners to mine segwit blocks will be overwhelming.  Segwit miners would probably almost prefer that legacy miners like bitmain get left behind for as long a possible.  That means even more txn fees for the segwit miners for as long as this occurs.  They'll have a field day.

For some people, it is the perfect response.  I see constant statements of claim by people who mix up opinion with evidence.  These statements are made without any basis in fact, complete disregard for actual established expert opinion, and mostly just based upon their 'feels', which in most part, is completely misplaced.  Even if they were capable of showing the basis for an educated opinion, I might let them go, but I'm sick to fucking death of fuckin morons parroting the guy with mental problems in rbtc, without ever attempting to validate their position.  
I make no apologies for using the method I use to shut the morons down.  They should be doing a lot more thinking, and a lot less opinionating, until their thought processes catch up with the keyboard tapping.

Maybe implement it at the node so that 1 block the hashing power is served by the gpu miners, 999 blocks, traditional.  Do that for 10 blocks.  Next 10 blocks, its 2 blocks, and 998, etc.  With some stochastics in there, that could work.
If you added an incentive (5%?) to the node, you'd get a massive uptake from both nodes and miners....

Exchanges are the worst of the confidence games.  You're thinking "I don't trust myself.  Perhaps I should trust them instead.".  You cannot.
Learn how to do it right when you are starting.  Use smaller quantities, and test whether it is working.  Soon, learn about full-nodes, and why you should be running one.  As the price of your bitcoin increases, it is really the only way you can secure your bitcoin for sure.

No, it is still immaterial.  Unless miners choose to attack the network, it makes not a jot of difference what they think.  Zero.  Zip.  Zilch.  Nada.  Nodes define consensus, not miners.  If miners don't produce blocks that nodes will accept, it doesn't matter how much hash they throw at it, it will still be rejected.  If they do decide to attack the network, they get PoW changed which turns all of their hardware into junk.

Actually, there's no real difference between the terms, because neither of them are actually medical terms.  The medical term is antisocial personality disorder.  The defining characteristic is the lack or reduced functioning of a conscience, but there are other effects too.  If there was a recognised difference it would be nurture over nature.   But that is also very hard to identify. 
 People, including psychologists, still use them because they are used in common language, but depending on who you talk to, the two terms have slightly different meanings.

Nodes define consensus in bitcoin numpty.  Nodes are nodes.  Nodes validate.  All of them do.  It's what they do.


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




Nodes are the agents in a multi-agent system enforcing consensus.
Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, validate the transactions, replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks, replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.

It's a legitimate concern, and it's true that bitcoin doesn't lend itself to privacy.  You an achieve it, but you have to work at it.  You really need to do a bit of self-analysis with this whole 'they' thing.  


Maybe they did.  The government started TOR.  I don't think so, but it's not like anyone's got any proof, either way.  But you're misunderstanding everything beyond that.  The code is there for everyone to see.  If there was a way to track it beyond what is already understood, it would be seen in the code.


The lightning network will definitely assist in this, because it will only commit aggregated transactions between channels to the block-chain.  You won't even know when the transaction was.  If I wore a tin-foil-hat (which I don't) I'd say that any regulatory powers that were actively trying to influence bitcoin, would be trying to stop that implementation.  Once the genie is out of that bottle, it won't be put back.

With the possible hard-fork for a capacity increase at some time in the future, I imagine there will be a number of actions over and above the capacity increase included in the fork.  I still think it's a way off, but the more people start migrating to segwit, the more minor 'issues' will be found, or features identified, that will be assisted with an implementation of a hard-fork.

You can build and use more secure methods of signing transactions that allow you to move those coins when you get more understanding of how it all works.

@_date: 2017-05-14 02:30:42
Oh dear.  You don't know how bitcoin actually works, do you?


That is an actual quote from the white-paper ya numpty.


Incorrect (besides sounding kind of stupid and crazy).  It is the longest **valid** chain, of which those nodes define that validity.  




What does this all mean if you are but a pointy headed numpty such as yourself?
Nodes are agents in a multi-agent system with an agreed set of consensus rules that ensure that the system functions. Transactions are propagated through the multi-agent network based upon the agreed consensus rules by nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Miners retrieve valid transactions from any of these nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then order the transactions, and perform a hashing function on them until the hashing function returns a value that is suitable to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then pass the new block that they've created to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. The nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, then validate the block to ensure that each of the transactions within the block agree with the consensus rules. They then pass the new valid block, if it is valid, to other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Then each of these other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, each do the same validation on every block.


Because bitmain has used a safety signalling mechanism as a blocking tool.  And when we get a flag-day instead, they will forever lose that ability.  They can decrease safety, and try to delay scalability, but they can't do more than that.
Ya need to turn off that rbtc tap. It makes ya stoopid. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:57:28
Segwit.  Implemented via a flag day with a long timeline like a year, and backwardly compatible for nodes so they don't need to upgrade, which almost all overwhelmingly do anyway.

BZZZZT.  wrong.


Immaterial. Even for old nodes, the blocks are larger, regardless of what part they see. They occupy more space. The blocks are bigger.  They occupy more space, and therefore take longer to transfer, because they are bigger.  Only in numpty-land do you look at two things of different size and say "they are the same size".  
They aren't.

I'm saying it makes no difference.  Bitcoin isn't going to be advanced by going all-in with a guy that clearly has mental problems.
What you don't get is that the only people that have this sense of urgency are the kids that follow the crazy guy.  I'm quite prepared to wait a year, or two years, for the miners to recognize that there are many methods to scaling bitcoin, but if you stand against the experts, the only thing you're going to be is an obstruction.  This aint a democracy, and it never will be.
That's if the core people don't just lose patience, and implement core code that isolates the offending miners from the network.  Because if the other 90% of miners realize that a small rump of crazy people is the only thing that's stopping them from earning lots more money, I can tell you how long their patience will last.
Either way, a lose collection of crazy morons might feel all woozy with their power trip, but they are completely ineffectual, and they never will achieve anything except a loud squeaky whinge.

Either miners produce segwit blocks or the 10s (100's?) of thousands  of mycelium and electrum users won't be placing transactions in blocks they order. They will ignore the blocks they produce. 
The miners that switch over, even if it is a fraction of them, will make out like bandits.  And every few blocks the non segwit miners will get reorged out. 
@_date: 2016-05-31 02:53:02
I get what you're saying dude, but you're inflating the issue, and more to the point, you're being a dick about it.  
So what if bitcoin is lost.   Do you accept that the amount lost is less than 50%?  Because the most you can make of that effect you're talking about is then 2x.  And if you think it's close to 50%, which it isn't, that can be shown by demonstrating how many coins have been moved. 
But the bigger point is something you haven't even touched on that has more to do with this subject than that crap you've been prattling on about.  Inflation is a product of TWO elements, not one.   It is supply AND liquidity.  Thats the reason why there are 0% interest rates.   They're pumping money into the financial system, but it isn't moving anywhere, because trillion of dollars are all locked up in the non performing loans in the American zombie property market.  When it does start to move, up goes inflation.
That has more to do with the price than the accessibility of all coins.

With mycelium and electrum both committing transactions to the uasf chain, the great bulk of non-node wallets (which also overwhelmingly support segwit) will be forcing miners to follow that chain.  If they don't, all of those mycelium and electrum users will not recognize transactions in blocks that are created by the mallicious miners.  Miners will have a choice : support china-coin, or support the tens of thousands of users that use electrum and mycelium.

I couldn't give a flying fuck whether miners choose to mine invalid blocks.  At present 97% of nodes are core and 84% are segwit. Invalid blocks will be rejected no matter how much hashing power is behind them.  If they wanna let themselves get forked, fuck em. They can burn their wheels until they upgrade their software to meet the requirements of the nodes.

Exactly.  As long as you have those keys (public and private) backed up safely, you can install that wallet client on any device, and have access to your funds.  There's a lot to learn, and secure full-nodes are the best fail-safe solution, but in my opinion, that is how best to start.
Hey, when sending from coinbase, don't accidentally put in your private key when you're asked where to send it.  I mean, that'd be kind of stupid, right?  Then they'd know your private key?
@_date: 2016-05-29 04:51:41
Sure.  I can actually hear your mind creaking through the gears on how to turn this in a scam, but it isn't going to work you know?
So, here's how to do it.  You open an escrow with USD$100 and provide a public key address.  The condition of the payment is that you receive USD$1 in that public address.  The proof of the transaction is the blockchain.info transaction showing the payment has occurred.   This is what it looks like :
It will show USD$1 going to the address you've nominated, and I get my $100.  Easy-peasy.

The thing that you haven't talked about is the routing.  It's all 1-to-1 cross-chain swaps.  But again, that's just because that's exactly the thing that lightning devs have been working on.  There's no reason to think that it couldn't be done this way.  It's just that it hasn't been done this way.

Incorrect.  So.  You don't know what a node does.
Another one of the numpties that doesn't know what consensus means.


Nodes are the agents. Bitmain is the one trying to create faulty-processes. And if they don't do their job, they're always welcome to find another one. UASF is their formal employment warning. Do your job, or you're fired.
So now that we know what the word consensus means, let's quote what satoshi ACTUALLY said :


What does this mean if you are but a pointy headed numpty?
Nodes are agents in a multi-agent system with an agreed set of consensus rules that ensure that the system functions. Transactions are propagated through the multi-agent network based upon the agreed consensus rules by nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Miners retrieve valid transactions from any of these nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then order the transactions, and perform a hashing function on them until the hashing function returns a value that is suitable to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then pass the new block that they've created to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. The nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, then validate the block to ensure that each of the transactions within the block agree with the consensus rules. They then pass the new block, if it is valid, to other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Then each of these other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, each do the same validation on every block.

Hey, I'm not saying that's the case.  It is clearly the best solution in the short-term, or at least, the best I can think of.  But there are some things it protects against, and others it doesn't.
This reminds me of the book 'The Black Swan'.  It's not the things you see and plan for that you have to worry about, it's the things you haven't thought about.  Taleb specifically mentions being asked to provide a risk analysis of a casino, given the math wonk he is.

No, not really.  rbtc people regularly bring up this "OMG $10 PER CHANNEL!!?!?!?!" bullshit, but it has as much basis in fact as any of their other moronic ramblings.  
The reality is, there will be less on-chain txn's required, so in the short-term, fees will go down as more people adopt lightning.  The thing most rbtc numpties fail to grasp is that people will WANT to use lightning.  Not just because of the lower fees, but because of its aggregated on-chain transactions, that provide so much more privacy.  
By the time bitcoin gets to 100's of millions of users (if ever) that might be an issue that has to be addressed.  By the time it needs to be addressed, if ever, at least the fees will be such that they will be paying for the mining, without the block reward.  As designed.

The price of an asset is a function of supply and demand.  Bitcoin has a limited supply as a proportion of actual capacity to buy it, so it will fluctuate depending upon any demand entering the market-place seeking to buy.  As the value of the whole asset increases, the amount any demand can bring to it will reduce, because the ratio will decrease, and therefore any single buy/sell transaction has less of an impact on the price.

No, it's the energy (which is scarce) that went into creating that specific item.  When you take that item, someone loses that asset.  To steal, one has to lose the thing that is stolen. Copying doesn't satisfy that criteria, because the other person still has the asset.

Oh look! Another rbtc numpty that doesn't know how bitcoin works!
Nodes define consensus in bitcoin numpty.  Nodes are nodes.  Nodes validate.  All of them do.  It's what they do.


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




Nodes are the agents in a multi-agent system enforcing consensus.
Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, validate the transactions, replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks, replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.

No, 100% of hashing power is supporting BIP141 (segwit) through BIP91.
As far as mining is concerned, it doesn't matter what they say, it matters what they do.  What they're doing is activating segwit, and the only reason that is possible is because the nodes are already enabled to accept the consensus change.  Even if miners wanted to activate 2x, they couldn't, because unlike segwit, the nodes are not interested in that consensus change.
@_date: 2017-07-24 02:37:26


And that it had such a long lead-time that you could reasonably expect that virtually all nodes were already upgraded to support the hard-fork by the time it is activated.  I reckon two years minimum.

I'm the one quoting the white-paper sunshine, not you.
Another one of the numpties that doesn't know what consensus means.


Nodes are the agents. Bitmain is the one trying to create faulty-processes. And if they don't do their job, they're always welcome to find another one. UASF is their formal employment warning. Do your job, or you're fired.
So now that we know what the word consensus means, let's quote what satoshi ACTUALLY said :


What does this mean if you are but a pointy headed numpty?
Nodes are agents in a multi-agent system with an agreed set of consensus rules that ensure that the system functions. Transactions are propagated through the multi-agent network based upon the agreed consensus rules by nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Miners retrieve valid transactions from any of these nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then order the transactions, and perform a hashing function on them until the hashing function returns a value that is suitable to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then pass the new block that they've created to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. The nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, then validate the block to ensure that each of the transactions within the block agree with the consensus rules. They then pass the new block, if it is valid, to other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Then each of these other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, each do the same validation on every block.

Bitcoin doesn't stop working with lightning you know?  It's still going to be your choice whether you use it or not.
What you'll find is that service providers will want you to use lightning, because it will be cheaper for them and you to continue to transact.  But if you still want to pay regular on-chain fees, go for your life.
You also need to realize that bitcoin can't be instantaneous because of the 10-minute block creation time.  Lightning, on the other hand, CAN provide instantaneous  irreversible transactions.  Which is another reason why you'd use lightning.

You know what  that makes me feel more than anything?  Sad. 
 The past 50 years, while there have been generation changing events, the concept of 'value' has been so corrupted that it bears no relation to what it did before. At a fundamental level there is a re-orientation underway.  There is so much than can go wrong for everyone as the current structure of even the concept of value is redefined. 
What should  value be?  Safety.  Family.  Opportunity.  Mobility.  For starters.  Most people are good. It is almost as if the current system rewards the undoing of what makes people want to be good.

The original concept of bitcoin is doing just fine.  It never had anything except an average 10 minute block creation time, so cannot be instantly traded.  This hasn't changed since its creation, and won't either.  
It is, however, the perfect digital cash.  It is your understanding of what constitutes cash that requires a bit more consideration.  It is possible to get it to do both with layer 2 solutions that segwit provides, but without that, bitcoin will continue kicking goals as the perfect store of value.

The caution should be about if you receive a payment.  The payment may get 'confirmed' but be re-org'd out because it was included in a block by a non-compliant miner.
Normally people say six confirmations should be sufficient for ensuring the payment will live on in the block-chain.  For the next few weeks, that should probably be extended.  The fact is, I don't know how much you'd extend it either.  If a miner is actually being malicious, that could be a very high number.

Micro-transactions at the sub-fraction of a cent.  A use-case would be an electrical smart-grid that allowed users to trade energy for bitcoin (solar/wind etc.).

I didn't say otherwise.  As I demonstrated, it doesn't make any difference to BIP148 enforcing nodes whether the block being produced is by a segwit miner, or a BIP148 miner.  They will both be valid blocks according to BIP148 enforcing nodes.  The question will be when there are two chains, one with segwit enforcement, and one without, which chain the miners build upon.   If even a single block gets produced by a BIP148 miner, the entire chain of the non-segwit blocks will be erased by both the segwit-signalling, and non-segwit-signalling miners.


Yes, but they'll be doing it signalling segwit, which is the requirement for BIP148 enforcing nodes.  The point.

The only way a PoW change is going to be successful is going to be as a result of an attack.  If that happens, core will release a PoW change update, and 100% of the nodes will update their clients accordingly.  And bitmain knows this, which is why they will never undertake such an attack.  I almost wish they would, because that would be such a humiliating smack-down of a miner, such that they would lose hundreds of millions of dollars, that no miner would ever even attempt to do the same thing again forever more.  And Jihan Wu would probably be led out onto a paddy-field to receive a bullet in the back of the head by the people who he just lost all that money of.

I've noticed it's actually pretty common amongst crim types.  They're, by definition, not very good at working with others.  I've always worked on the premise that there are far more good intelligent people then there are bad intelligent people, and the more intelligent you are, the more likely you are to reflect on yourself, and not do things that are bad for yourself and other people.  That's not to say there aren't bad intelligent people, and good unintelligent people, of course. 
Being really intelligent is the exception to the rule.  Being really bad is the exception to the rule.  Being bad and intelligent is even less likely.  So what you generally have is exceptionally bad people that aren't exceptionally intelligent.  The exceptionally intelligent people generally are intelligent enough, and reflective enough, to not do, or even want to do, the bad things in the first place.

 You keep using this word but not in the correct context.  In bitcoin consensus != agreement. If bitcoin were attacked the pow change delivered by core would be swift and brutal.

You think this hasn't been thought through?  I mean seriously... It is pure fantasy to assume that bitmain has any ability to attack a different pow.  It is pure fantasy that bitmain will attack bitcoin. The only reason there hasn't been a pow change yet is because it would be generally accepted that wu is not stupid.

There are 2^256 addresses in bitcoin.  That is :

There are [10^80 atoms in the universe.](/astrochemistry/fl/Number-of-Atoms-in-the-Universe.htm)
So 1 bitcoin address for every ~800 atoms in the universe.  I imagine the universe number I used last time was a different number.  Same rough order of magnitude though.  The post said atoms in the universe was 10^78 to 10^82.  Somewhere in that ball-park.  I imagine the number I used for atoms last time was somewhere about 10^79 instead.

It is not a black and white question.  Theoretically 10% could be sufficient.  No one actually knows.  It's like a game of chicken though.  If a miner like bitfury or btcc or slush wants to kick it off they probably can.  As soon as they do the other segwit miners will follow, that I'm confident on.  If mining is 30% and txns are being processed through mycelium and electrum, it's all over red rover.  Segwit activates. 
Anyone who says they do know for sure either way is lying.

I don't think there's any debate that it is an asset.  The legitimate concern is whether the value of the asset (relative to other assets) is going to go up, down, or remain the same.  The fact that people are buying it at a greater rate than new coins are minted (for now at least) kind of demonstrates that people view it as such.  If people sell all of their coins, or if no one is prepared to buy them, it becomes a worthless asset.  If that's the case, there would be no incentive to mine, so it will cease to function in all practical terms.

I don't think opposite is the word, and he didn't really say it was.  A node used by a miner wouldn't be an economic node, and yet it is not a sybil node.  
A node has a number of primary services.  Its primary purpose is to validate transactions and blocks to ensure they meet consensus requirements.  One of its most important functions is to allow a user to interract with the blockchain by making and receiving transactions, and that would be considered an economic node. Another one of its function is that it serves the blockchain to other nodes.  They also provide a memory pool that is coordinated between other nodes to allow miners to source transactions that they order in blocks. 
Without actually performing any of those functions, you could be reasonably classed as a sybil node.

@_date: 2017-07-30 00:06:31
Perhaps you need to read less, because linking the white paper hasn't helped you understand it. 
Right. So let's start. What you need to stop doing, is thinking you should have any opinion at all, until you know what you're talking about. It's not opinion first, justification later. It's justification first, opinion later. Try it.
So. Lightning. Lightning allows users to take a single bitcoin transaction, and use it over a finite space of time, in order to shift bitcoin back and forth, with no or vanishingly small transaction fees, as iou's between what are called 'lightning channels'. The actual transaction size will be the same as a normal transaction, with a flag that says it can only be committed to the blockchain at a specific time (or block depth). In effect, these lightning transactions are cryptographically signed 'iou's. **The 'thousands' of back-and-forth iou changes are discarded when the channel is closed** (massive privacy dividend), and only the aggregated change is committed to the blockchain. This is the great thing about lightning. It is a single transaction with as many inputs and outputs (one/two) as defined in the original transaction. Only the transaction values change.
Consider a channel link of this : John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne. Only the people next to each other in the chain have a 'channel open' with each other (John/Bob, Bob/Sally, Sally/Anne). Assuming each of the channels between all of the participants have adequate funds in order to achieve this, if John wanted to send 1btc to Anne. A transaction ledger would read :
John-&gt;Bob channel : John -1btc, Bob +1btc
Bob-&gt;Sally channel : Bob -1btc, Sally +1btc
Sally-&gt;Anne channel : Sally -1btc, Anne +1btc.
Anne now has 1btc more, and John has 1btc less, but the net effect in each channel is simply a modification to the distribution of bitcoin in that channel.
Imagine this happening, back and forth, and extended to thousands, tens of thousands, and millions of people. As long as there's a chain between them, you use the chain. You might even have your transaction split over multiple chains. For links that don't have a chain, you create a channel on-the-fly.
Each channel, therefore, only ends up with the same single input, and the same two outputs, just differing values.
It's significantly more complex than that (transaction routing, and channel closure mechanics), but that's the idea. I wish I could remember the lightning dev that explained it. It really is very clever. I haven't actually questioned about the effect of having channels with multiple inputs (John/Sally) and outputs (Bob/Anne) at inception. Technically, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible. Just a much weirder set of ramifications.
So THAT is a bitcoin scalability solution. THAT is what segwit enables. INCLUDING a block size increase, and the other bug fixes.

Segwit isn't really about full blocks but about the malleability fix that allows instantaneous transactions through lightning.  Without segwit, this is a piece of functionality that ltc has that btc doesn't.  The jury is still out on whether this is something that people want to use. Lots of numpties scream for it, but in practice, it hasn't yet been proven that people will be willing to use these systems at scale. It might be years before they are used, if ever. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:06:01
It's a modification to the transaction format.  This modification allows the block to be re-structured so that more data can be stored in a block, and more transactions can fit in a block.  It also has a malleability fix, and the quadratic to linear hashing fix.
That's 18 months.  Bitmain has been blocking scalability pretty much since then.

I've said lots, which is why I said it.  This dangerous obsession of some people for increasing the blocksize needs to be countered where it is voiced.  I didn't even want the segwit blocksize increase.  But I compromised because of the other advantages that BIP141 has like the malleability fix (not to mention the asicboost fix).  
But I'm glad that that change is going to be bedded down for some length of time before another capacity upgrade is considered.  If it can be done where it doesn't negatively affect the full-node count, and can be objectively asserted as such, you won't get me obstructing it.

Just like shutting down napster led to torrents.  Shutting off ISP connections led to VPNs.  Big data analysis and tracking led to Tor.  The drug war led to increased prices and more powerful drugs.

You're blathering on about hard-drive space, and wondering why no-one listens to you.  You're like one of those people that can't figure out where the reins are on their car.
Upload bandwidth has not improved sufficiently such that nodes can be run from a standard internet connection.  If anything, as has been repeatedly stated from the actual developers, the block-size should be decreased, not increased.  I am, in fact, using exactly the same internet connection bandwidth that I was 10 years ago, and there aren't any other options for me improving it either.  That means a node can't be run in Australia, one of the largest per-capita users of bitcoin in the world.  How fucking stupid would that be?  Until technology, in the area of bandwidth, and specifically upload bandwidth, increases, the block-size should not be, and will not be, increased.

It doesn't matter so much to users, as the txns being added to the bip9 signaling chain will not know about nor care about them.  The miners on the non bip9 lose all their rewards. 
The bip9 miners will continue adding to the segwit signaling chain will they not?  And be making that chain longer too, yes? How will they know that that chain is anything except the valid chain? Segwit signaling regularly goes over 50% does it not?
I'm pretty sure that's the way it works.  I think you need to sit down and actually think this through. 
All i can say is non segwit miners better hope they activated segwit before aug1

Not really.  You can close a channel any time you want.  That's one of the great things about segwit.  It makes that possible.


By that rationale someone stealing your private keys is an off-chain transaction.


I didn't say it had the same security.  No-confirmation transactions have reduced security as well.  Does that make them not bitcoin transactions?  Confirmed transactions sometimes get re-orged out.  Does that make them not bitcoin transactions?  The electrum wallet isn't a full-node.  You're using a 3rd party to transact with the block-chain.  Does that make them not bitcoin transactions?

Yes.  There is nothing to 'get together'.  There is a malicious miner blocking scalability improvements.  The bitcoin community is working through the options of how to overcome that malicious miner.




OK.   Lightning allows users to take a single bitcoin transaction, and use it over a finite space of time, in order to shift bitcoin back and forth, with no or vanishingly small transaction fees, as iou's between what are called 'lightning channels'. The actual transaction size will be the same as a normal transaction, with a flag that says it can only be committed to the blockchain at a specific time (or block depth). In effect, these lightning transactions are cryptographically signed 'iou's. The 'thousands' of back-and-forth iou changes are discarded when the channel is closed (massive privacy dividend), and only the aggregated change is committed to the blockchain. This is the great thing about lightning. It is a single transaction with as many inputs and outputs (one/two) as defined in the original transaction. Only the transaction values change.
Consider a channel link of this : John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne. Only the people next to each people in the chain have a 'channel open' with each other (John/Bob, Bob/Sally, Sally/Anne). Assuming each of the channels between all of the participants have adequate funds in order to achieve this, if John wanted to send 1btc to Anne. A transaction ledger would read :
John-&gt;Bob channel : John -1btc, Bob +1btc
Bob-&gt;Sally channel : Bob -1btc, Sally +1btc
Sally-&gt;Anne channel : Sally -1btc, Anne +1btc.
Anne now has 1btc more, and John has 1btc less, but the net effect in each channel is simply a modification to the distribution of bitcoin in that channel.
Imagine this happening, back and forth, and extended to thousands, tens of thousands, and millions of people. As long as there's a chain between them, you use the chain. You might even have your transaction split over multiple chains. For links that don't have a chain, you create a channel on-the-fly.
Each channel, therefore, only ends up with the same single input, and the same two outputs, just differing values.
It's significantly more complex than that (transaction routing, and channel closure mechanics), but that's the idea. I wish I could remember the lightning dev that explained it. It really is very clever. I haven't actually questioned about the effect of having channels with multiple inputs (John/Sally) and outputs (Bob/Anne) at inception. Technically, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible. Just a much weirder set of ramifications.
So THAT is a bitcoin scalability solution. THAT is what segwit enables. INCLUDING a block size increase, and the other bug fixes.

The bitcoin blockchains cryptographic proof is the application of energy such that, with each block, the energy to undo the previous block becomes exponentially more difficult.  The service that the bitcoin network provides, is a trustless method to exchange wealth, where unrelated actors, for completely different incentives, ensure that your transactions are secure, and are backed by an increasing volume of energy.
So what you're paying for, in bitcoin, is energy.  Energy that is algorithmically planned to be exponentially more difficult to undo than to do, to ensure that your decisions are final.

You've just parroted the complete misunderstanding of the OP.  You get that a lot if you get your news off goldseek.  Bitcoin is still a tiny market.  The amount of money that would need to be pumped into bitcoin such that it was actually a protection vs a US dollar collapse would be in the trillions.  Even if bitcoin was one million dollars a coin, that would reflect only 1/3 of the gold investment market.  That doesn't even touch on the currency market, or the assets markets, let alone the entire commodities markets.  And then there's the futures market.
Bitcoin has a lot of way to go up as an asset class long before it is even recognized in the same breath as a commodity, let alone a currency.  And the chances of that happening at all is still anyones guess.

I find this attitude very strange, especially from an American, and an American academic at that.  I'm not talking about the 'American revolution', but about the American constitution.  The 1st and 2nd amendments (as an example) aren't about what you have permission to do, but about what the government has permission to do in your name.  You don't have permission to speak freely, the government doesn't have permission to stop you.  It's not that you have permission to have guns, it's that your government doesn't have the permission to remove them.
It's not up to the users of bitcoin (or anything) to define the box that they live in.  It's up to the government to put forward policy so that it may be reviewed and rejected as required and as is permissible under the existing laws and the constitution.  
You shouldn't be helping the government to develop rules.  You should be challenging them.

Or the segwit signalling enforcing miners that are not that network, because... you know... they're not bitmain.  If the relaying advantage that is generally helpful actually means that it gets isolated from the nodes that are propagating a different chain...
What I'm saying is, I don't think it's 50/50.  Is it 60/40?  55/45?  65/35?  I don't know.  The advantages of being a centralized miner in china might, in fact, be an impedance.  The question is, how much?

I remember when, many years ago, I read in the economist about the new revolution in producing key-card locks at hotels.  The fact that keys would be obsolete, and you wouldn't have to worry about either previous people coming back to a room, or if a key was lost, replacing it.  It was going to cost money to implement, but the benefits were just too great to ignore.

I've always believed that the timing of BIP148 was too short.  BIP149, with its integrated ability for activation via MASF, and much longer extended activation period, is, in my opinion, a far better and safer option.  My initial thoughts were that this would be 18 months to two years.
I understand that everyone wants segwit (except, of course, bitmain) but I just don't think there's any rush.  Sure, it's not ideal that txn costs are as high as they are.  This is the long-term peoples.  It's not important what happens in the next year, or two years, but 10 or 20.  If we're going to implement a protocol change against hostile miners, it really needs to dot every i and cross every t.  And not rely upon everyone choosing an alternate cilent reference, but to just have it as a regular core update.  I think it's great that it is gaining so much traction, so that it becomes clear that that's what users want.  It should be clear that BIP149 is something that should be included at some point in the core reference?  Perhaps with the ability to opt-out?
So sorry I think BIP148 creates good pressure, and has led to good dicussion on what is the best way to implement a UASF, but I think it's just too much too soon.  It has certainly highlighted the fact that some miners, are indeed, hostile.  BIP149, I think, is going to lead to segwit in a far more comprehensive and safe fashion.
But that being said : I'd still accept BIP148.

A different discussion.  


I'd prefer no block-size increase, but am willing to accept it if it includes the malleability fix and the quadratic to linear hashing fix.
But what we were talking about was the lies.  He said :


Which is incorrect.  Segwit over doubles the block size.
It is bitmain that is blocking on-chain scaling.
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:32:40


Segwit didn't originally come with a block-size increase.  It didn't need it, nor was it sought by the core developers, especially Luke Dashjr.   The compromise was adding the block-size increase by re-engineering the block to the exact block-size increase that classic implemented unsafely has a hard-fork.  Do you know who designed it?  Luke Dashjr, the guy that most vehemently didn't want a block-size increase.
And what happened?  "You gave us what we wanted, but now we want more".

Hard-forks require you to stop using your software and start using a different piece of software, and require a great deal of planning and lead-time to be effective.  I can't see one happening within the next year, more like two, if one is even required at all.

I don't think you have actually thought through what effect bip148 nodes will have on what are currently now segwit signaling miners.

@_date: 2017-07-20 06:06:32
Because you're one of the people who doesn't know how bitcoin works, you don't realize that it is nodes that define consensus in bitcoin.  And because of that, you don't understand that changing the block size requires nodes to accept your change, and those nodes do want segwit, and those nodes don't want a hard-fork.

Sure it does.  Is lightning possible without segwit (and I mean actually usable)?  No?  Then segwit allows thousands of transactions per second.

Without the nodes uninstalling their existing core reference node client (10's of thousands of them) the segwit2x proposal is going to complete the segwit part, and the 2x is going to die in the ass like XT, classic, and BU, for exactly the same reason.

We are talking about an aug1 bip148 chain that will only accept blocks produced by segwit signalling miners.  Currently miners that produce blocks that will be acceptable is about 46% on average, and they regularly go above 50%.
We're talking about how that mechanism plays out when those segwit signalling miners start building upon the chain that only accepts blocks that have been produced by segwit signalling miners.  Any reason why they won't?  I can't think of any.

I don't see how you could isolate the mobile from non-mobile pulls of akami and ofcom has a specific regulatory responsibility for licensing mobile telco spectrum, and i don't see anything that states that mobile and fixed line has been separated. When quoting fixed line specific performance they have their own issues. 


Whenever they quote these figures they use averages and not medians.   If you have 10 people that use a service, and one service gets added that is 10x faster than the others (as happens with the limited introduction of fibre), 10 connections haven't gotten 10% faster, have they?  You can get statistics to say anything i guess.  But if they were honestly interested in reporting broadband speed  increases they'd use median, not average.  That median incense would be negligible, and it is the median you need to be concerned about. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 05:39:13

@_date: 2017-07-14 02:51:06


First off, that's false.  More miners are still core, and on average 46% signal segwit via bip9 and 80%+ signal segwit with frankensegwit.  
But that's immaterial for the most part, because your hashpower is irrelevant if the blockchain won't accept your blocks.  Explain to me why you think the current segwit signalling miners won't continue building upon the segwit signalling only chain?
Right now we have a race every block to see who wins the reward.  The bip148 nodes are going to turn that into a race until the next time the existing segwit signalling miners go above 50% to the chain that accepts both signalling and non-signalling blocks, which is about [30% of the last two weeks](  When that happens, the entire chain of non segwit signalling blocks gets destroyed by even the non-segwit signalling miners.
All it takes is a single race to be won after the split.  two segwit signalling blocks right after a non-segwit signalling block, or a single block produced by a bip148 miner, and then all segwit signalling miners are going to be building the segwit only chain.
I think I have it right.  Took a couple of weeks off the bitcoin drama and thought about it a bit.  Would love to hear why I'm wrong...
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:18:32
Good move.  Best move is to use the node client software as your wallet, but that can be daunting for new user.  If you wanted to be really secure you'd have both a core and a uasf node. 
As far as I'm concerned, electrum is the next best thing.  The issue is going to be during the transition if there is one. Unless you want to game the system (unwise) it will be better to not transact until the dust settles.  If frankensegwit activates segwit before aug1 even better.

It would be hard, and require some degree of coordination, but these aren't end-of-the-world types of complexity problems are they?

No, it is not about the name.  It is a technical argument, which is why you guys almost relentlessly fail to recognize it, because you don't really understand how bitcoin works, because you don't really understand what a node does.  If you did know, you'd understand the technical problem, and you wouldn't think as you do.
@_date: 2017-07-06 03:38:32


Yeah yeah.  80,000+ users of core ref nodes are going to suddenly uninstall their core-ref node and install a new unreviewed, untested, and untrusted node client written by a bunch of flaming numpties.  You wanna install the china-coin node client?  Be my guest.  I'll just continue using bitcoin.


You have it backwards sunshine.  Are YOU going to sell all of your coins on the existing bitcoin network, cuz it aint goin nowhere, and double-down on china-coin?  Good luck.
@_date: 2017-07-19 04:00:44
 The  term "mining nodes" was invented by people who don't understand the role of nodes in bitcoin because they couldn't understand why the consensus changes they wanted weren't being implemented.  The term 'economic node' was developed to explain why this was the case after the xt, classic and BU attacks, and has been completely misunderstood by the same people because they can't understand why even if they have political players they STILL can't get the consensus changes they want. 
Nodes are nodes.  If you want to understand bitcoin, you need to understand their role, and what they actually do.

This will be greatly assisted if people who don't know how bitcoin works stopped trying to implement changes that don't work. 
A contentious hf of the manner you just regurgitated is pure fantasy.  It is never going to happen, and if you knew how bitcoin worked you'd know this as well.  If bitmain wants to fork off to china-coin, that is their prerogative.  It has always been so. The rest of bitcoin will just continue using bitcoin.  You can't force the 10's of thousands of nodes to uninstall their current core ref node client and install a different one, and that is the only way that you wind up with a hard-fork that doesn't lead to a china-coin alt.  Unless the bitcoin network was attacked, or a critical patch was required, even core couldn't achieve this.

Discussions about facts aren't about proving you're wrong.  That is just how you wind up with a long litany of justifications for why you're wrong, of which you hear 30% of it.  And if you say things that are wrong so frequently, and you hear that 30% of it has no basis in reality, you might start thinking that the other 70% has more of a basis in reality.  But back in the real world, you're 100% wrong, but are only corrected 30% of the time.
What you need to do is to establish an opinion that you could reasonably expect to be 100% correct.  And until you have that opinion, accept that your opinion is unfounded, and act accordingly.

No, that is a seed for creating private keys.  Once that seed is used, all of the private keys housed within that seed can be used by that wallet.
There are essentially two main types of wallets (yes yes there are more, but another time...).  There is one that holds a single private key, and the other which is what is called a [heirarchical deterministic (HD) wallet](  The HD wallet has many private keys and you have access to all of the funds that are controlled by those keys.
I use both.  I have electrum HD on my desktop, and I put some funds into a private key on my desktop wallet.  I then use the private key at that address, and load that on to my electrum wallet on my phone.  That way, I am spending from the same address from two different devices.  I only keep a small amount on my phone this way.  At any time I can move those funds both from my phone and from my desktop.

@_date: 2017-07-06 00:54:51
In order for a hard-fork to be successful in bitcoin, 10's of thousands of existing users of core-ref nodes will need to uninstall their existing node clients and install an unreviewed, untested, and untrusted node client.  Even if core wanted to do that, it would be tough, and they don't want to do that.  So there is sfa chance of a hard-fork being enacted in any time-frame that doesn't use 'years' as a unit.  If people want to hard-fork bitcoin, they're welcome to do so.  They've always been welcome to do so.  There's nothing stopping them doing it today.   Everyone else will just continue using bitcoin.

I'm all for bitmain producing large blocks when and if they get 50% or more of the hashpower.  Good luck!
My node will reject their blocks, and so will everyone elses, but they'll finally have their big blocks!  They don't need to wait, of course.  They could do it now!  They'll have their big blocks in a blockchain that only a bunch of useful idiots like yourself will use.  Before they're re-orged out, and they lose whatever pennies they can bring to bear.

You need to school yourself on the difference between speculation and investing.  Both of them are legitimate strategies, but the two are not the same.

It uses bitcoin.  The channels are scripted bitcoin transactions.  There are a number of protocols that have been developed that detail the mechanics of how channels are closed.


No-one owns the lightning network.  It is even more decentralized than bitcoin.  The entire lightning source-code, like bitcoin, is open source.  There were six implementations of lightning under development the last time I looked.  In practice, it will be even easier to manage your own transactions privately than is currently possible with bitcoin, and anyone will have the opportunity to run it however they like.


It is as much a bank as bitcoin and torrents are.  If you think that, you should probably review what I wrote again.  It is, quite literally, the opposite of a bank.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:17:08


It doesn't.  A lightning channel is a scripted bitcoin transaction.


These are bitcoin transactions.


Incorrect.  As I stated.  It is a delayed transaction on the block-chain.  


I really think you need to re-read what I said.  Only people who have channels, which are bitcoin transactions, communicate with each other.  They are communicating having an independent cryptographic proof between those two parties detailing who owns what percentage of the channel.


Lightning transactions?  No.  Only the on-chain commitments are public, as they are bitcoin transactions.  The only people who record those transactions are the contributors to each channel.  They are discarded at the closing of the channel.  This effectively lets the genie out of the bottle with regard to privacy in bitcoin.  It will be simply impossible to track where the bitcoin is moving in the system and why.


I'm not sure what that means.
@_date: 2017-05-05 11:24:36
I'm now invested in litecoin for exactly this reason.  No time for eth, but litecoin now has all of the features that bitcoin would like to have.  Litecoin could very well take away the developers that are currently kicking goals for bitcoin. 
But let's still keep in mind that bitcoin continues to increase in value.  Some other crypto may overtake it in market-cap, but it doesn't necessarily take away the value that already exists there.  I don't care what anyone says, but the market for bricks-and-mortar businesses and micro-transactions still isn't proven.  I know this from personal experience.  It still might be years before it's something that people actually are prepared to use at anything more than hobby scale.

For the record.  I use the electrum wallet on android.  I can import a key directly (like from the jaxx wallet) and use the funds immediately.  I changed from the mycelium wallet because it didn't allow as much control of the fees you pay.
The electrum wallet on android allows me to select an algorithm in which it predicts what the miner reward would be to get the transaction confirmed in roughly X time.  "Priority", "Normal", and something else.  I don't use them.  I don't find them trustworthy for determining a fee.
I know that a transaction with two inputs and one output is roughly 200bytes on the blockchain.  So when I need a transaction, I monitor this site :
I look down there right now, and I see at 61-80 satoshiti's per byte there have been 8000 transactions today that have been confirmed, and there are 400 in the pool.  So, in one day, and with a fair degree of confidence, I would expect that that transaction will be confirmed.
In the old days I would have multiplied 80sat/byte * 200bytes to get 16000 satoshis, or 0.00016BTC to know the fee.  But the electrum wallet allows you to set the fee at satoshis/byte, so you can just set it at 80.
Don't know about Jaxx.  Electrum is good.

Not quite.  They ignore non-segwit (i.e. BIP141) *signalling* blocks.  I remember learning of this subtlety myself. BIP141 itself requires 95% of miners over the space of ~2000 blocks to signal segwit activation. BIP91 only builds on blocks that signal BIP141, which is how they get to 95%. Almost 100% of miners have already indicated that they will do this.  This is the thing that just started.

No, BIP91 is what the miners have agreed to activate recently.  BIP141 is the mechanism that activates segwit that all miners have agreed to force all other miners to follow.


So job done then.  Segwit happens.  Good job core.

Relax dude.  Power play by the miners, but the fact is, they have zero control over the nodes, and that 2x component requires 10's of thousands of nodes to uninstall their existing core ref node client and installing an unreviewed, untested, untrusted and buggy node client instead.  It's never going to happen.

You see, that's the problem.  The only reason we have AML/KYC is because the US forced other countries to adopt it. Have you ever heard of [operation choke-point]( That's the part where the US department of justice forces credit-card companies and banks to close accounts to people who the US government thinks are immoral, like those in prostitution. That's perfectly legal in my country thanks, and I don't appreciate your regulations affecting people from my country. But more than that, AML/KYC doesn't protect against terrorism, and it doesn't protect against money-laundering.  According to your colleague at MIT, Professor Chomsky, [the largest funder of terrorism in the world is the U.S. government]( and frankly, there's no real argument about it.  Only over the past month we've learned of hundreds of billions of dollars that have been laundered through companies that are part of this regulatory regime that you are actively attempting to integrate into.
We don't have a regulatory problem.  We have a rule-of-law problem.  And a great bulk of the people responsible for breaking those laws are not subject to regulation OR the rule-of-law.  How many people went to jail for the GFC?  One guy in france?
But all of this is a moot point.
It isn't up to the people who are subjected to these regulations and technical solutions you want to implement, to develop new laws, regulations and technical solutions to be subjected to.  The state will always do this without your assistance, and I know of not even a single instance in which assisting in the development of such laws leads to beneficial outcomes to the people being subjected to them.  We should be challenging these laws, not developing new ones.  We certainly shouldn't be assisting in the development of technical solutions to circumvent things that DON'T have regulations, which is what you are currently doing.

It is  these miners that will be adding blocks to the segwit signaling only chain, and those blocks will be accepted by all nodes because they signal segwit.  They will be adding to that chain, and i can't think of any reason why they wouldn't.  If you don't think so, explain why you think that is the case?

An increase to the expected blocksize of the NYA shenanigans will mean a node cannot be run from a consumer internet connection in Australia at any price.  So no, I don't think I like that hard-fork very much thanks.  Even the Segwit compromise of a block-size increase just gets under the upload bandwidth requirements.  That's why it was such a compromise.  If it had been up to me, we would have had the malleability fix and quadratic hashing bug fix without the block-size increase.  But, like i said, people like me compromised.

You never did understand how bitcoin works did you?  Nodes define consensus (i.e. forks) in bitcoin, not miners.  So what he said was completely true.
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:48:35
Electrum and mycelium have both said they are using uasf nodes.  So any transactions sent, or more importantly received by users of those wallets will only accept that the txns have gotten into the blockchain if they are in segwit blocks. 
Remember that segwit will allow a 2x+ capacity increase.  So in a worse case scenario and only 10% of miners switch, they'll have twice the capacity, higher fees for the txns they order, and their blocks will continually overwrite the blocks of the 90% hashing invalid blocks.  It isn't going to take long for the miners hashing reorged blocks to figure out they just keep losing money.  I expect bitfury, slush and btcc to quickly switch over, and their txn profits and block rewards are going to go through the roof.  It is in their interests for bitmain to delay as long as they can.  The longer they delay, the more money they earn.

@_date: 2017-07-10 08:58:52

@_date: 2017-07-14 09:03:16


What are you talking about?  I'm talking about segwit signalling which is the defining characteristic by which they exclude a block.


Yes, and I'm working through the logic of what it would take in order for the non-signalling blocks being excluded.  And it isn't a straight 50/50 question, either.  I'm working out how much hashing power would be necessary to periodically re-set the non-wipeout protection chain.  Because if 10%, or 20% of the non-segwit blocks are being re-org'd out, it should mean it is causing them to burn power for rewards that keep disappearing.


Which just contradicted your first sentence.
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:03:16

 That is never going to happen.  The only thing miners are doing is signaling segwit. How many do you think are even using the btc1 client?  Sfa that's how many.  Any miner that doesn't want their nodes to fall over will be using the BIP91 segsignal client. 
Miners follow nodes, not the other way around.  Segwit is being activated simply because of the threat of BIP148, which is a coordinated node deployment, and even IT relies upon nodes already being segwit capable.  How else do you think it is even possible for segwit to activate?  Because the nodes are already ready for it, as they have been patiently upgrading their node clients for the past year.  This is nothing more than coup attempt number five.  It will fail for exactly the same reason xt, classic, and bu failed, and exactly why abc is going to fail.  Because if you can't convince 10s of thousands of nodes to uninstall their node client and install yours, your chance of success is exactly zero.

LOL.  And this is where you get to see the power of core.  There are two instances in which a HF will be immediately successful.  1.  To fix a critical bug.  2. to change the PoW as a response to an attack.  I'd be extremely surprised if the binaries haven't been created already, including a method of releasing it as a response to a state-actor attack, let alone just a miner.
And poof, like that, bitmain washes hundreds of millions of dollars down the toilet.  I almost want it to happen so that any miner is permanently scarred such that they never even contemplate it in the future.  They know this of course.  Everyone does. 
Oh, and I'm not saying that miners won't introduce a hard-fork.  They've have always had that prerogative, and good luck to them if they do.  I'm just saying that bitcoin won't be affected, because nodes define and police consensus in bitcoin, not miners.

That's why we have scientists actually measure these things.  The world is best served by voicing opinions as opinions, and facts as facts.  Especially when your opinion incorrectly belittles the abilities of others, and you act as though it is fact.

Generally speaking, people who are five foot tall are probably not as good at basketball as people who are seven foot tall.  But a seven foot tall woman is probably going to be better at basketball, all things considered, than a man who is five foot tall.  Unless you're theorizing that black people are genetically superior at basketball?  And here's me thinking all they had was a 'natural sense of rhythm'.
Methinks you need to have a bit of a think about your world view and how that manifests itself in your biases.  It's tough work doing this, and you're not alone.  If anything, this is a human trait that is shared by all.  That's why it is even more important to recognize when anyone is doing it.

I will use an answer yesterday about this very subject. 
A node has a number of primary services. Its primary purpose is to validate transactions and blocks to ensure they meet consensus requirements and add them to their local copy of bitcoin "as it is". One of its most important functions is to allow a user to interract with the blockchain directly by making and receiving transactions, and that would be considered an economic node. Another one of its function is that it serves the blockchain to other nodes. They also provide a memory pool that is coordinated between other nodes to allow miners to source transactions that they order in blocks.
Without actually performing any of those functions, you could be reasonably classed as a sybil node.
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:38:17


The community will continue using bitcoin.  You can hard-fork to china-coin if you like.


Yep.  Like XT, like Classic, like BU, now btc1.  Tell me... how did it work out for the other coup attempts?


The problem is, you never do make that choice.  If you did, we wouldn't be talking.  Hard-fork.  Do it today.  If you think people will follow you, you have nothing to fear.
@_date: 2016-07-20 03:27:34

It works exactly as designed. As is evidenced by the price. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:05:09
I'm the one who used the entire paragragh.  


What does this mean if you are but a pointy headed numpty?
Nodes are agents in a multi-agent system with an agreed set of consensus rules that ensure that the system functions. Transactions are propagated through the multi-agent network based upon the agreed consensus rules by nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Miners retrieve valid transactions from any of these nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then order the transactions, and perform a hashing function on them until the hashing function returns a value that is suitable to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then pass the new block that they've created to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. The nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, then validate the block to ensure that each of the transactions within the block agree with the consensus rules. They then pass the new block, if it is valid, to other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Then each of these other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, each do the same validation on every block.

In order for that to occur, all of the 10's of thousands of nodes would need to uninstall their node client, and install another node client which devalued their holdings.
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:24:17


Yes.  That's what consensus in bitcoin actually means.  Most of the people who comment here that come from the rbtc cesspool struggle to understand the role that nodes play in bitcoin, and propagate their lack of understanding.  And true, it's a bit complex.  But the role of nodes hasn't changed.  If you want to understand how a fork actually happens, whether soft or hard, you have to understand what a node does, because nodes define and police consensus in bitcoin.

Does that separate consumer broadband from broadband offered through cloud services?  Looking at their methodology, I don't think it does.  Also, that includes mobile services which would skew the numbers significantly, because they are faster, and there are more of them being added, but they almost all have caps, regardless of their bandwidth.  You aint likely to be running a bitcoin node on a phone plan.  Looking at their methodology, I think it does include these too.
The big question is how fast existing users speeds, and specifically upload speed, are upgrading, not how fast newer faster broadband services are being added, many of which are completely unsuited to bitcoin traffic.

The private key has nothing to do with where it is used.  I can't believe this has to be explained.  Electrum has an android wallet.  You create a wallet, and record the seed you used to create it.  You can go to another phone, use that same key, and spend the coins from the other phone as well.  It is the private key that defines who can spend the money, not where an app is installed.

BU is a coup attempt.  BCC at least is a hard-fork.  I'd prefer if they hard-forked.  You can't force people to use it, and they can't force you to use it.  I wish them good luck, and may they ever focus on the things that are important to them on that chain.
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:37:55


Because bigger blocks decreases the security of the network, which the nodes police.  So they simply would not have upgraded to the increased blocksize through a hard-fork that splits the network by design.  Segregated witness is a soft-fork, so is backwardly compatible, and has bug-fixes as well, so the people who run the nodes overwhelmingly accepted that change.

Ordinary people require a node to transact with the blockchain unless they use A THIRD PARTY.  That's your premise is it?  That it's preferable to use third-parties to interract with the blockchain?

It is not a 'segwit chain' it is a chain, and a chain for which they are adversarially assuming is valid, because it is longest.  It is longest because they are adding to it.  They don't know about, nor care, that that chain only exists because some nodes have not included blocks from non-segwit signalling miners. 
Like I said... think it through.  Think it through from the first split.  From the time in which there are two chains, one with a normal block on top of it produced by a segwit signalling miner, and one with a normal block on top of it produced by a non-segwit signalling miner.  Is there some mechanism you can think of that would lead them to not continue building upon the segwit signalling forced chain?

You didn't answer the question.  Does an envelope have intrinsic value?  I actually know that you know the answer to this question, so let's proceed on the premise that you do.  
If I have a letter that I need to send securely, would I prefer to send it open, and ready to be read?  Or would I prefer for it to be sent within the confines of an envelope.  Now let's think... would I prefer to just leave an open envelope, or would I think it necessary to put some seal across it to ensure that it isn't opened, and read whilst en-route.  Hmm... but what if someone can counterfeit the seal?  I need some method of ensuring that the message I want to get to that person isn't read, and preferably, isn't even identified as a message.  That's when you need to get lawyers involved. Sounds expensive.  There's obviously something intrinsically valuable about such a service, because many people pay oh-so-very-much money for it.
Now let's imagine we're not talking about letters, we're talking about money.  Would you address a $100 note through the mail to your child for their birthday?  You'd pay for a stamp at least.  Would you encase it in an envelope that you paid for at the local post-shop?  Hmm... bill in the envelope.  Perhaps encase it in a card?  What if it is $1000?  $10,000?  Does this protection of the service of an envelope somehow decrease because the value of the contents of the package increases?
What say you?  Is an envelope intrinsically valuable?

I think you need to re-visit this concept.  In order to acquire bitcoin, someone has to buy, and someone needs to sell them.  A sidechain is nothing more than a set-number of 'pegged' coins, and allowing, through the side-chain, the ability to create transactions on the blockchain based upon the sidechain rules, using the bitcoin that has been 'pegged'.  side-chains are simply the ability to create valid bitcoin txn id's based upon someone elses algorithms.

I use the electrum wallet now on android.  It allows me complete control of the fees I pay for transactions.  I use electrum desktop as well which I use as my main store of bitcoin addresses.  I then move some of my coins into one of the addresses on the desktop wallet to be used as a hot-wallet (~$100).  I then import that key into my electrum android wallet.  So even if I lose my phone, the key is already part of the keys of my seed.  At any time, I can empty my phone wallet of the funds there.
I used to do this on mycelium too.  But their inability to set the fees for a transaction was the primary reason I switched.

There you go again trying to re-define it.  No, any two coins aren't interchangeable.  Two gold coins of equal weight, and no identifying marks (cut from bullion?) are interchangeable.  They are, therefore, perfectly fungible.  You might even say that two 50c australian piece coins of the same year are fungible, because they don't have identifying marks.  You can't say that if you were selecting one that was of a rare age, and one that wasn't.  So 'any two coins are interchangeable' is demonstrably false.

I'm against a block-size increase *but I compromised* and am prepared to accept it if it includes the malleability fix and the quadratic hashing bug fix.
What I'm really against is a hard-fork.  There are only two instances in which a hard-fork **might** be acceptable.  As an emergency bug-fix (or PoW change) or with an extended implementation of something like 2+ years, and includes features that are investigated and tested for a year before that.

Err... no.   The txn on the side chain only has to produce a valid txn at that point in time.  It could be just that the sidechain releases the coin if the script in some way recognises the person asking for the txn is named Kevin.
The complexity of the linking to the sidechain is up to the sidechain script handler.   Think 'ETH/DAO'

Which increases fees for the segwit miners.  They make out like bandits.  More txns per block and less miners.  Which incentivizes more miners to join.

Immaterial to the discussion of what constitutes a hard-fork or a soft-fork.


Immaterial.  The nodes won't accept blocks that are not segwit.  Indeed, that is the very reason why BIP148 forces miners to produce segwit blocks.
Ya need to turn off that rbtc tap.  It makes ya stupit.
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:46:17


Nodes define consensus in bitcoin, not miners.  The only reason that segwit is going to activate is because tens of thousands of nodes have updated their client refs to version 0.13.1 or above in droves over the past year.  That same process would be required, and even more, for a hard-fork.
It aint gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:53:45


Yes.  Which makes this kinda true :




@_date: 2017-06-08 06:39:59

@_date: 2017-06-20 00:36:36


Not easily, but yes they could.


Err...no.  It still requires all (or mostly all) of those tens of thousands of nodes to agree to the new soft-fork consensus rules change.
Want an example of it?  SegWit!  It required those tens of thousands of users to upgrade their node client to accept segwit blocks.  
But there are other ways of increasing blocks-space with a soft-fork, like was mentioned the other day in drivechains.  You have to trust the mining group to not steal your money, but some people are okay with that.  Those txns aren't replicated to all of the other nodes after all.  But if that's the way you wanna play it, be my guest.  You can even still validly call yourself 'bitcoin'.  Go for it!

No, the only question is will anyone care if someone wants to make a fork at some point in the future.  Because unless you uninstall the existing core ref node client, and install that node client, the only thing that will happen will be that someone creates a pre-mined alt.

With all due respect, you don't know how a derivative is calculated.  It doesn't require anchoring to an asset at all.  It is people simply providing a contract between two parties that agree to pay under agreed conditions that are generally derived as a ratio between two assets values.  It really is nothing more than gambling, but it does provide liquidity because it allows investors to hedge their investments at as little a cost as is available in the market.

You fail to mention that you can't force the tens of thousands of current core ref node users to install the china-coin hard-fork client.  So it is not 'baked in' because the two can't be forcefully linked.

So that would be a yes.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:27:26


I assume nothing.  There is however the statistically probable : 80,000+ users of core-ref node clients do nothing and continue using their core-ref node client.  And vanishingly minute possibility : 80,000+ users of core-ref node clients uninstall their core-ref node client, and install the un-reviewed and un-tested china-coin node client.


You're about to learn the error of that assumption.


All nodes share the SAME consensus.  That's what consensus means.  Bitcoin.  That's how it works.
@_date: 2017-06-19 07:12:58


Segwit is the compromise.


Immaterial.  Without the tens of thousands of users currently running core ref nodes actively turning off their nodes and replacing them with the china-coin hard-fork client, bitcoin will just continue on being bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-19 10:18:58
I understand, but it's still the other way around.  Someone will have to create a non-consensus transaction or block.  That will be rejected by the core nodes.  So it is the people making the non-consensus txn or block that fork themselves, not the other way around.
Kinda semantics though.

Oh look! Another rbtc numpty that doesn't know how bitcoin works!
Nodes define consensus in bitcoin numpty.  Nodes are nodes.  Nodes validate.  All of them do.  It's what they do.


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




What does this mean if you are but a pointy headed numpty? 
Nodes are agents in a multi-agent system with an agreed set of consensus rules that ensure that the system functions. Transactions are propagated through the multi-agent network based upon the agreed consensus rules by nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Miners retrieve valid transactions from any of these nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then order the transactions, and perform a hashing function on them until the hashing function returns a value that is suitable to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then pass the new block that they've created to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. The nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, then validate the block to ensure that each of the transactions within the block agree with the consensus rules. They then pass the new valid block, if it is valid, to other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Then each of these other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, each do the same validation on every block.
Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes don't want, it is rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, validate the transactions, replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks, replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.

If you come out of this now knowing the definition of consensus, all good!
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:09:44


No.  Seriously.  You don't seem to have a strong grasp of how the bitcoin network works.


So we should just make sure all miners are in china behind the chinese firewall?
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:32:27




You clearly don't know how consensus works.
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:40:26


Incorrect.  Because if what you said was true, miners would already have forked bitcoin to their plan, would they have not?  What has stopped them do you think?
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:39:14
I did.  Nodes define and enforce consensus in bitcoin, not miners. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:26:24
Why are you here then?
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:18:52
I'll take the segwit.  The hf is never. gonna. happen.  80,000+ users  running core nodes are never going to uninstall their core ref node client and install the china-coin client.  It's ridiculous to even imagine this is possible. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:48:00
Oh look one-week-old rbtc sock-puppet account attacks core.  That's new.

Yeah.  I will.  lol.  


And you are welcome to your china-coin hard-fork.  Good luck!

No assumptions about you batting zero for three sunshine.

No we weren't.  This is what we were discussing :




What we were talking about is how bitcoin works, which you just demonstrated, you do not know.

@_date: 2017-06-15 11:41:14


Yep I get it.  You don't get it.  Even when confronted with the definition used in context, you carry on like you're adding something to the discussion.  You're not.
It doesn't really matter what you 'think' though.

@_date: 2017-06-18 11:58:22
Let me guess... american?
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:36:36
Because nodes define consensus, not miners.  And so it doesn't matter how many miners you have, if their solution doesn't activate before aug1 uasf is happening anyway. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 03:25:21


Not 330k savings.  330k bitcoin.  How much you think that bitcoin will be worth in a year?  five years?
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:48:11
You need to stop reading the rbtc cesspool. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 06:35:32
Take it up with bitmain.  They're the ones blocking scalability.
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:08:07
Talking in circles seems to be the china-coin apologists basis for a hard-fork.
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:27:56
Sounds like the truth hurt.
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:40:18
Oh look, someone who doesn't know how bitcoin works!
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:56:55


Never gonna happen.  Well, it might happen, but only a loose collection of numpty-folk will follow them onto china-coin. And by then both segwit and lightning will be in production.
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:50:22
Who said I was?
@_date: 2017-06-04 06:20:11


Doesn't have the quadratic hashing bug fix, so no thanks.  Segwit is a solution that is safe.  Currently blocked by bitmain.
@_date: 2017-06-19 02:29:02


Nah.  You can use china-coin if you like.  I'll just keep using bitcoin.  Good luck though.  I hope china-coin is all that you hope it is.
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:59:40


Prove it.
@_date: 2017-06-20 03:51:04


UASF-BIP148 has led to this change-of-heart, nothing else.  The miners have just figured out that they have far more to lose than anyone else.


It looks like it worked.  But until they actually activate segwit, I don't believe even this.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:59:32


You really don't know what's going on do you?  Are you sure they're not going to accidentally re-org the litecoin chain?
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:52:31
If this is the justification that bitmain needs in order to put segwit into production, I can handle it.  I won't believe it until it happens though.
But that HF proposal is dead in the water.
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:59:22
HYEGAFT?  Need to give that to the boys in marketing.
@_date: 2017-07-23 08:02:11


Storage space isn't the main consideration, upload bandwidth is.


Solutions like lightning, which segwit effectively enables, aggregates the transactions to the blockchain before they are committed.  So instead of 50 transactions (or a hundred, or a thousand) there are two.
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:59:10


Do it then.  See how it works out for ya.
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:29:40
Nodes define consensus in bitcoin, not miners.

You really don't know how this whole bitcoin thing works, do you?
Think this through... who would make the announcement of the switch over?  Jeff Garzick?  "It's ok guys.  Everyone can switch over to the new china-coin client now.  It's legit guys.  Totally the best node client there is.  Number a1.  You can switch off your old nodes now.  Everything is gonna be fiiiiiiine."
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:58:07
Nah.  Thanks for the suggestion though.
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:39:35
Anyone who thinks that tens of thousands of nodes are going to install  the china-coin hard-fork client really doesn't understand how bitcoin works. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:53:26


If it isn't 100% then it isn't a plan.

And exactly what was the NY thing?  A bunch of corp types having a pow-wow?  You fail by even your own logic.
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:03:34
I'll take the segwit.  They can keep the hard-fork.
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:52:25


What the fk does 'virtual consensus' mean?
There are only two instances in which a hard-fork **might** be acceptable.  As an emergency bug-fix (or PoW change) or with an extended implementation of something like 2+ years, and includes features that are investigated and tested for a year before that.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:00:53
Dude.  80,000+ existing bitcoin core-ref nodes.  A hf is never going to happen, at least with anything to do with this proposal.
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:58:17


Que?  No.  Hashpower means squat if the nodes don't change the consensus rules.  If the nodes don't enforce the changed consensus rules, they can throw whatever hash they want at it, and it will make absolutely no difference whatsoever.
It is the nodes that define and enforce consensus rules.  A hard-fork is a change in these consensus rules.  Without an overwhelming proportion of nodes upgrading, the only thing they'll do is fork themselves off of the network.
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:02:58

No-one was stopping you from providing your own solution.  They aren't paid.  Miners are.
@_date: 2016-07-15 20:11:14
@_date: 2017-06-19 01:50:52


Yeah... nah.  The nodes that matter (i.e. everyone but a small collection of numpty-folk) won't be installing the china-coin client, or all they'll be is nodes that matter on the china-coin chain.  Bitcoin will remain unaffected.
You'd think after a year and a half of coup attempt after coup attempt and being thwarted by the nodes again and again and again, you would have figured this out.  But here we are.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:41:43
Ah bitcoin.  You never fail to provide drama.
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:45:24
No they don't.  Nodes define consensus in bitcoin.  If miners want the block reward, they provide blocks that meet the node consensus rules or they get nothing.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:49:08
Not interested in the products you're selling thanks. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:29:57


Getting tens of thousands of users to turn off their core-ref node clients and install and run the china-coin node client is not going to happen.  
@_date: 2016-07-18 20:49:00


@_date: 2017-06-20 01:03:06




So yeah.  I guess "the list was only for people who supported the agreement and intended to support it." isn't my idea of an open development process.


There is no such thing as a simple hard-fork.
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:01:30
Looks like it frightened the miners into action, didn't it?
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:27:29
Why is roger ver an adviser for your company if you support segwit?
@_date: 2017-06-19 04:43:46
Miners have nothing to do with the activation of a hard-fork.  Nodes define consensus in bitcoin, not miners.
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:54:02
You install the china-coin hard-fork client if you want.  I'll just continue using bitcoin thanks.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:34:45

You wanna lose whatever money you have, you do it then.  Good luck!

Nah.  You can start up another coin if you think that's an important feature.
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:15:54


wtf?  It's a consensus mechanism that uses miners for their pow service.  A pow algorithm that can be changed at any time by the nodes that validate.
@_date: 2017-06-16 01:20:30


Laughable.  
You want a hard-fork?  Unless it's an emergency patch, two years minimum.  And I mean minimum.
Segwit is the compromise.
@_date: 2017-06-08 02:56:16
I remember thinking the property market bubble had to burst.  I've lived in Vancouver, and in Sydney, and in Melbourne, and in London.  It had to crash.  Those prices just can't keep going up, can they?  That was 10 years ago.  I was wrong.  They could keep going up.  and up and up and up.  And more up.

Yes it was.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:25:22
You mean the segwit one?  Or the one that would require the 80,000+ core nodes to uninstall their core-ref node client, and install the china-coin client?
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:02:21


Fkn hell.  If you needed any more proof that the rbtc crowd are a bunch of flat-earther morons, this would seal it.

Oh yes it does.  The hard limit of reality.  There are constraints to everything. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 04:44:58
These are the businesses that give a status of their segwit adoption.
   
When and if bitmain chooses to hard-fork to china-coin, they'll provide you a node client you can install if you want to access it.
@_date: 2017-06-03 04:04:38
Have privacy elements been implemented yet?  Actually curious.  Is it possible yet to create anonymous stores?

@_date: 2017-06-20 01:35:14


Yeah.  I'll take the segwit, but they can keep the hard-fork.


That requires tens of thousands of existing bitcoin node users to uninstall their existing core-ref node client, and install the unreviewed, untested china-coin node client in three months.  Never gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-06-16 02:59:43


Yes it is, because blocks will be able to hold more transactions.  At present this isn't an issue for litecoin.  For Bitcoin it is.


Perhaps you should actually read the article?
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:47:36


As soon as a block is produced that does not meet the existing core consensus rules it is rejected by any and all core-ref clients, regardless of what you call it.

@_date: 2017-07-24 13:49:03
 Yeah, i don't get it.  They have the opportunity to safely hard-fork off.  No one is forcing anyone to follow the fork. Its not for me, but if there's a market for it, they're welcome to it.  I say good luck.

Without the nodes behind them, it doesn't really matter, because no change to consensus rules in bitcoin will ever be released again that relies on miner signalling.

Unless you get the tens of thousands of current core-ref nodes installing the china-coin node client, only segwit is going to happen.  Segwit is only going to happen because that's exactly what those node users did.  They installed the core ref node client from 0.13.1 on.

Nah.  You have a hypothesis.  Prove it.  Can't prove it can you?  
A theory without evidence is a hypothesis.  A theory with no evidence that contradicts it is proof, or as close to proof as science effectively gets.

You install your china-coin node client if you want. 


Oh you mean like the previous set of numpties that created a node client that no one used?  They called themselves classic didn't they? How did it work out for them?  Or was that the BU numpties after them?  Or are you referring to the XT numpties before them both?

@_date: 2017-06-21 00:32:21


No.  It isn't.  Bandwidth is the issue.  So why are you talking about the thing that isn't the issue, instead of the thing that is?
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:05:40


80,000+ core-ref node users suddenly all think it's a great idea to uninstall their software and install an unreviewed untested china-coin hard-fork client?  Yeah.  That would be no.


The only way to get a hard-fork is people installing the china-coin software.  And it is THOSE people who hard-fork themselves from the network.

@_date: 2017-06-20 14:47:46


Without the nodes you have nothing.  Nodes define and police consensus in bitcoin, not miners, nor companies.


That's because it doesn't matter what they say.


It is the people who are creating the fork-client that get forked.  dur.  In order for the fork to be successful the existing nodes must uninstall their node client and re-install the china-coin node client.  You really don't know how any of this works, do you?


Those shit-coins didn't have 80,000+ nodes that have no intention of installing the china-coin node client.


No, those are a specific type of node that the people who run that site collect.  They don't let anyone know what their selection criteria is.  You can ask them if you like.  
These are the nodes.

If they manage to get all miners to signal for segwit before aug 1, and call it segwit2x, good luck to em.  They might think that people will adopt their hard-fork, but it is just not going to happen.
Miners have a choice.  Segwit with segwit2x before aug1, or segwit with bip148 after aug1.  Everything else is shadowboxing.

No doubt about that.  But that doesn't have anything to do with the list of miners you provided.
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:08:31


 Yes they do.  It is nodes that literally hold and enforce the rules of consensus through validation. If you don't know this, then you have a fundamental lack of understanding of how bitcoin works. It doesn't even matter how many nodes there are, but matters who makes and accepts transactions using those consensus rules. 
I don't know how someone can go so long in bitcoin without understanding how the most basic parts work. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 05:46:37
BIP91, uasf and core, are compatible with segwit.  btc1 has a planned hard-fork in three or so months.  In order for a hard-fork to be successful, the existing nodes (10's of thousands of them) will need to uninstall their existing node client and install another one that, by most accounts, is simply not as reliable as the core one.  If bitmain chooses to fork off in three months (which I actually doubt is going to happen) the users that fork with them will need to run that other client.  Everyone else will just continue using bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-06-19 07:01:54
Nodes define consensus in bitcoin, not miners.  They don't have a node client that anyone wants to install, so it doesn't really matter what they think.  Tens of thousands of users running core ref nodes aren't going to be installing their china-coin hard-fork node client.
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:56:43
I don't even know what you're arguing for to be honest.  My main issue always has been hard-forks because of the issue with coordination of a switch-over.  
As long as a solution is peer-reviewed, tested, widely supported, and doesn't lead to centralization pressures, I'm not that concerned.  If it does lead to centralization, another soft-fork could be introduced that disables the thing that causes the problem, and that will be widely adopted.  Otherwise known as adversarial protocol development.  This has already occurred with the response to chain-anchor by MIT.

@_date: 2017-06-19 05:22:30
Actually they don't.  Without anyone at all mining coins on a hard-forked chain, it's not going to have any blocks created, but they don't actually have anything to do with the hard-fork process.  They produce blocks that meet node consensus rules, or they don't.  They don't get any say in the consensus rules themselves, and it is the consensus rules changing that defines a hard-fork.
You guys regularly fail to understand how bitcoin works with regard to nodes.

So you go looking and you find that you can't find a fridge for $500 anymore.  They're all $550 now.  That's 10% inflation, right?  Not so fast. All of the new fridges now come in a choice of not just white, but also off-white and ivory.  You, the consumer, has now had a "qualitative improvement" in your fridge acquisition and use case experience.  Great eh?
Well how much is that improvement worth?  The wonks in the guvmint apply hedonistic regression to calculate that that qualitative improvement equates to $60.
Congratulations.  Everything is now 10% more expensive, but inflation has gone down. Holy shit, right?

Without those 80,000+ node users uninstalling the core ref client and installing the china-coin node client, it is china-coin that is the hard-fork.  You can follow it if you like.  I'll just continue to use bitcoin.

Yeah.  I reckon I'll just run the core ref.  If they wanna fork to china-coin, I aint gonna stop em.

If these self-appointed important people want more assistance being identified, perhaps they might call themselves the bitcoin reserve board?  Oh that's right, bitcoin is a decentralized system.  It is the nodes that maintain and enforce consensus.

@_date: 2017-06-17 21:44:08


 The majority of node users won't install the china-coin hard-fork client. That's a fact that the miners can't get around, and is a requirement for any hard-fork to be successful. 
@_date: 2016-07-30 04:10:37

If bitmain attacks the network, there'll be an emergency PoW change that can reset the difficulty.
So your choices will be 1. hard-fork to new PoW by core.  2. hard-fork to china-coin because china-coin is attacking the network.
ffs, you people really don't have a clue, do you?
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:13:53

The increase of franksegwit would lead to a blocksize that would not be possible to run a node on most consumer internet connections in Australia at any price.  The upload bandwidth is capped below a level that would be required to run a node.  So you've immediately centralized the network more than what exists currently with a single change.
@_date: 2017-07-12 12:06:38

You don't know the meaning of the word.


It's kinda immaterial what you think.  It's what the users that control nodes that manage transactions in the bitcoin network think, that makes a difference.  They are providing a node client modification that will force malicious miners off of the network if they get the support they are seeking.
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:52:07
By running node client software that enforces consensus.  You really need to learn what a node does.  It'll make a lot more sense to you then.

@_date: 2017-06-18 05:03:46
I don't deny it.  You just mistake the authority that would come with a core coordinated emergency hard fork pow change.  You think they haven't thought about this possibility?  That would be lazy, stupid, and very risky.  These are not the key attributes of the contributors to core.

Clearly your researching skills are as robust as your analytical skills.


Oh dear.  It's right in the segwit eli5 misinformation pack.  No surprise you didn't read it.


Tell me : How successful is a hard-fork without 100% adoption?  Isn't that what you want as an alternative?


Quicker than every node having to upgrade to a new hard-forked client?  How many websites, exchanges, wallets etc have to upgrade for a hard-fork eh?  Hellloooo!!!!!  Is anyone home?!?!!?!?  Nodes make transactions.  Wallets talk to nodes.  Nodes come with a wallet.  Exchanges use nodes to accept and transmit bitcoin.  It matters sweet-fuck-all what website talks to it.  What matters is what the nodes will accept as a valid transaction and block.
You don't have a fkn clue what you're talking about.  Ya need to turn off that rbtc tap. It makes ya stupid.
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:14:23
You will probably find it surprising how risk-averse node operators are and what the chances of them installing a non core-ref node client is.
You want extremism?  A hard-fork.

Long enough to see your type come and go. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:10:29


Good thing you're not part of the decision making process then.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:29:05
I'm happy that the incentives are aligned. That is, indeed, the only thing you can do. It is this lack of aligned incentives that has caused a malicious miner to think that bitcoin is their own china-coin. It will be nice to have it back where it should be.  It is the honest miners that have been hurt most in this situation. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:07:11
Nah.  Think I'll just take segwit thanks.  You can install the china-coin hard-fork client if you want.  I'll just continue using bitcoin.  Good luck though.  I hope the coin is everything you hoped for.
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:25:24

No.  Just no.  Nodes define consensus in bitcoin, not miners.  Unless you get the 80,000+ core-ref nodes to uninstall their node client and install the china-coin node client, it is never going to happen.
And you really think all those 80,000 nodes are going to do that?  ha.  hahahahaha.  hahaahhaahahahaha.
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:24:13

About 83% the last time I looked.  That's enough though, as it is backward compatible.  And that took over a year, with close to a year of testing and test releases before that.
How many china-coin hard-fork clients are there do you reckon?  Oh that's right, it hasn't even been written yet.
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:30:28


Which the nodes define.  The only way segwit is going to go active is because tens of thousands of users have installed and are continuing to use the core-ref client from version 0.13.1 on.  That aint gonna happen with a china-coin hard-fork.
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:00:54


Bingo.  But you guys waste money all of the time.  Remember the classic fiasco?  
Let me know how to get on.
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:36:11
You know what, I was going to be immediately dismissive, but that's just silly.  It's true, the hashing function / algorithm of a miner never really interested me.
Don't the transactions in a block matter?  i.e. if a block has been found with N transactions in it, you have to re-compile your block in order to start hashing again?  Isn't that how orphans are created?  When two blocks are created at the same time, and yet one of them is the one that is accepted?  Less miners will mean that this is less likely to happen, yes?
@_date: 2017-06-20 06:32:03

@_date: 2017-06-15 04:52:20

@_date: 2017-06-05 11:28:58
No.  A hard fork requires all nodes, and more importantly, transactions, to upgrade to the new consensus rules.  Old transactions will no longer work after a hard fork.
A hard fork is a replacement of the rules. 
This really is a fundamental misunderstanding (one of many)  perpetuated by the rbtc cesspool. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:50:18
You go and ask them when and if they're going to be installing the the china-coin hard-fork client, and forking themselves off of bitcoin.

Because miners don't initiate hard-forks, nodes do.  In fact, it is nodes that initiate all forks.  Because it is nodes that define and police the consensus rules in bitcoin, not miners.
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:53:12
Right. So let's start. What you need to stop doing, is thinking you should have any opinion at all, until you know what you're talking about. It's not opinion first, justification later. It's justification first, opinion later. Try it.
So. Lightning. Lightning allows users to take a single bitcoin transaction, and use it over a finite space of time, in order to shift bitcoin back and forth, with no or vanishingly small transaction fees, as iou's between what are called 'lightning channels'. The actual transaction size will be the same as a normal transaction, with a flag that says it can only be committed to the blockchain at a specific time (or block depth). In effect, these lightning transactions are cryptographically signed 'iou's. The 'thousands' of back-and-forth iou changes are discarded when the channel is closed (massive privacy dividend), and only the aggregated change is committed to the blockchain. This is the great thing about lightning. It is a single transaction with as many inputs and outputs (one/two) as defined in the original transaction. Only the transaction values change.
Consider a channel link of this : John-&gt;Bob-&gt;Sally-&gt;Anne. Only the people next to each other in the chain have a 'channel open' with each other (John/Bob, Bob/Sally, Sally/Anne). Assuming each of the channels between all of the participants have adequate funds in order to achieve this, if John wanted to send 1btc to Anne. A transaction ledger would read :
John-&gt;Bob channel : John -1btc, Bob +1btc
Bob-&gt;Sally channel : Bob -1btc, Sally +1btc
Sally-&gt;Anne channel : Sally -1btc, Anne +1btc.
Anne now has 1btc more, and John has 1btc less, but the net effect in each channel is simply a modification to the distribution of bitcoin in that channel.
Imagine this happening, back and forth, and extended to thousands, tens of thousands, and millions of people. As long as there's a chain between them, you use the chain. You might even have your transaction split over multiple chains. For links that don't have a chain, you create a channel on-the-fly.
Each channel, therefore, only ends up with the same single input, and the same two outputs, just differing values.
It's significantly more complex than that (transaction routing, and channel closure mechanics), but that's the idea. I wish I could remember the lightning dev that explained it. It really is very clever. I haven't actually questioned about the effect of having channels with multiple inputs (John/Sally) and outputs (Bob/Anne) at inception. Technically, I can't see any reason why this wouldn't be possible. Just a much weirder set of ramifications.
So THAT is a bitcoin scalability solution. THAT is what segwit enables. INCLUDING a block size increase, and the other bug fixes. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:42:02

Not interested in a hard-fork thanks, let alone one that isn't even tested.  Anyone who thinks this is a good idea doesn't understand the complexity of the thing they're proposing.

Bitcoin transaction time hasn't changed.  It is average 10 minutes by design.  It is the exact opposite of unreliable.


I'm on the side of core sunshine.  I'd say I'm getting exactly what I asked for.
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:59:41
Let's start with the white paper :


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




What does this mean if you are but a pointy headed numpty? 
Nodes are agents in a multi-agent system with an agreed set of consensus rules that ensure that the system functions. Transactions are propagated through the multi-agent network based upon the agreed consensus rules by nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Miners retrieve valid transactions from any of these nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then order the transactions, and perform a hashing function on them until the hashing function returns a value that is suitable to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. They then pass the new block that they've created to the nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. The nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, then validate the block to ensure that each of the transactions within the block agree with the consensus rules. They then pass the new valid block, if it is valid, to other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system. Then each of these other nodes, which are agents in a multi-agent system, each do the same validation on every block.
Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that nodes determine don't meet consensus rules, it is rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, validate the transactions, replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks, replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.
So nodes maintain the protocol, not miners.  It is thus.  It has always been thus.
See for yourself.  [Download it.](  It's currently at 0.14.2


It is this fundamental lack of understanding of bitcoin that is perpetuated by the numpty-folk. Consensus isn't about 'agreement after the fact'.   It's about logic rules and a mechanism to propagate trustlessness.  
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:40:02

Why don't you?  If you don't like the consensus model of bitcoin, no one is forcing you to use it.  If you think you have a better idea, feel free to garner support for it.  Personally, I'm not interested in bitcoin becoming china-coin, so i support the current upgrade proposals.

@_date: 2017-06-20 00:38:38


In three months?  Err no.  A peer-reviewed, tested, and widely applauded protocol change like segwit took over a year to get the nodes to upgrade to a sufficient level to ensure that segwit will safely deploy to all nodes, and that took something coming from core.  An un-tested, un-reviewed hard-fork closed development process client in three months?  Never going to happen.

@_date: 2017-06-15 08:28:15
Finally!  A question worthy of reflection!! 
The reality is, there isn't one.  A non technical issue that is.  Nodes have consensus rules.  We are not as yet at the point where bitcoin satisfies all of the requirements of consensus.  An example of this is the asicboost bug.  Another one is the quadratic hashing bug fix.  Another one is the malleability fix.  I'm one of the people that couldn't give a flying fuck about the blocksize except in the purely abstract sense. 
Incentives are not yet aligned in such a way such that decentralization, censorship resistance, and security concerns can be safely ignored and the node clients can predictably continue without further refinement. The only discussion worth mentioning relates to the technical requirements to achieve these outcomes and how best to deploy them given the technical constraints of the bitcoin consensus mechanism. 
And that me lad, is a technical discussion.

For the segwit part of the frankensegwit proposal, it's sort of immaterial.  It's miners trying to save face on the best way to activate segwit while also seeming like they're in charge of something.  Almost all of the tens of thousands of core ref nodes will already work with segwit.
The rbtc tears will come when they finally learn that the hard-fork is never going to happen.  Well, it might happen, but only a loose collection of numpty-folk will follow them onto china-coin.  And by then both segwit and lightning will be in production.

I think it would be a valid assumption that bitmain controls more than 50% of the hashing power.  ViaBTC, Antpool, BTC.com, BTCTop, bitclub, and canoe are all widely considered to be bitmain.

Use them then.
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:44:17
I didn't make this word up ya numpty.  I'm using it in the context of the bitcoin white paper.  Here :


First, you have to understand what 'consensus' actually means :




Nodes are the agents in a multi-agent system enforcing consensus.
Nodes accept incoming transactions and validate them. Miners don't. Nodes replicate transactions to other nodes. Miners don't. Miners take transactions from nodes, and order them in a block, and perform a hashing function on them (the only thing they do). Miners pass the new block to the node. The node validates the transactions in the block. Miners don't. The node validates the block. Miners don't. The node replicates the block to other nodes. Miners don't.
There is only one function that miners do. They take transactions, put them in a block, and hash them. As soon as a miner produces a block that any node determines does not obey consensus rules, it is rejected. It doesn't even matter if another node has already accepted, because consensus is aligned with all nodes. Any node that replicates non-consensus blocks or transactions is itself rejected.
So nodes accept the transactions, validate the transactions, replicate the transactions, maintain the mempools, validate the blocks, replicate the blocks, serve the blockchain, and store the blockchain. Nodes even define the PoW algorithm that miners have to employ.
Nodes maintain the protocol, not miners. It is thus. It has always been thus.
See for yourself. Download it.
It's currently at 0.14.2

@_date: 2017-06-09 21:29:48

I'm sure if you didn't understand how consensus worked, it would be confusing, yes.
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:03:59


Which is immaterial, because the BIP148 nodes won't recognize that work.


Not really.  If that scenario is true, there's a possibility of ensuring the implementation of BIP148, but the opposite doesn't hold true.

@_date: 2017-06-20 15:25:12
What the hell do account holders have to do with it?   Consensus is maintained and policed by the nodes.  Without them changing from one node client version to another en-masse, any hard fork will die.   account count doesn't define how consensus works. The existing node users have to physically uninstall the core ref node client, and install the china-coin  node client.  It is  just not gong to happen.

Yup.  There's no way to 'force a hardfork' of course.  If they do a hard-fork they have to pray that tens of thousands of people will uninstall their core ref node and install the china-coin node client.  That aint never gonna happen.


I'm not holding my breath.  I think bitmain is just stalling, as they have been doing for a year.  So it's back to BIP148 UASF that I reckon has a 50/50 chance.  If that doesn't happen it's BIP149 about a year from now as part of the core distro.

UASF-BIP148 does seem to be gaining traction and there are still two months to go.  If i were to hazard a guess i reckon the chances are 50/50.  If slush, bitfury, and btcc have already agreed to activate segwit block creation, it's all over red rover.  They don't even need to tell anyone.  In fact, it might even be in their interests not to, so that they can get the windfall of mining txn profits that will happen if they do.
I wouldn't have expected by this time to be 50/50.  I thought it was a long shot.

Or how about the litany of numpty concern-trolling that segwit isn't a block-size increase?  Remember the pages and pages devoted to that?

You have that backward.  It's not preventing a hard-fork.  You have to describe how the hard-fork will actually happen, because the china-coin cheer-squad clearly doesn't have a clue of the technical process itself.
The existing core-ref node users have to physically turn-off their existing core-ref node clients and install the china-coin hard-fork node client.  There are 80,000+ of these nodes.  In order for a hard-fork to occur, all of them would have to do this.  It is never going to happen.
@_date: 2017-06-19 10:12:17


lol.  no.  you have it backwards.  They'll have to split the chain knowing that the core nodes won't follow them.  It would be like any other hard-fork.  You can follow them to china-coin if you want.  I'll just continue using bitcoin.

Don't use bitcoin then.  Goodbye. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 00:16:18
95% minimum for a soft-fork.  For a hard-fork it's 100%.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:44:41
If you think a hf can be achieved without the nodes uninstalling their existing software and replacing it with other software, you don't understand how bitcoin works, no.
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:41:01
Feel free to install the china-coin node client if you want to use the hard-fork.  Good luck!
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:03:26
It's mostly them, yeah.  I expect that Wu controls more than 50% right now.  The only question really is how much more. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:22:11
I'm a shocking gambler.  You?
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:01:10


It's the bold part that matters.
@_date: 2017-06-05 08:24:13
TIL.  I didn't know of that subtlety.
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:00:15
Access to the bandwidth that connects nodes and miners.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:39:53
A hf aint gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:32:23
Nodes define consensus in bitcoin, not miners. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:49:19
It matters squat if the nodes that define consensus in bitcoin don't change their consensus rules.


Never gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:59:12


You run your node, I'll run mine.
@_date: 2017-06-18 02:05:10
Are you actually interested in learning how bitcoin works?   I'd be happy to explain it to you, as you clearly don't know.   Or would you prefer to receive smackdown after smackdown until it dawns upon you that you don't have a fkn clue of what you're talking about?
 Which would you prefer?
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:54:49
Bitmain is against it.  The users overwhelmingly support segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-20 08:04:09
Nodes define consensus, not miners.  If miners choose to use their service for some other purpose good luck to them.  Other miners will be happy to take their place, providing the service of creating blocks for the nodes that define bitcoin.


I'm with the 80,000+ nodes that serve the bitcoin blockchain thanks.  You can fork off to china-coin if you like.  Hey, if you're gonna do that, I'd recommend choosing a coin that isn't pre-mined like bitcoin.  Litecoin?  It's your money though.  You can throw it away if you like.
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:04:23
So now we see that it was, in fact, spam.
@_date: 2017-06-18 00:02:27
 After many coup attempts bitcoin is still the gold standard in crypto.  If you feel like it doesn't meet your use case, no one is holding a gun to your head to use it.  If you prefer the benevolent dictator model of crypto, there are plenty of other options.
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:35:54
There won't be a hard-fork, so you can make whatever other proposal you like.
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:48:04


In a few years.  Maybe.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:32:54
lol.  So just how do you envisage the 80,000+ core ref nodes uninstalling their node client software, and installing the china-coin node client?
@_date: 2016-07-15 09:35:03


There's no accepted technical definition of the difference, so i rely upon the opinion of Warren Buffet on the subject.  Investing has a dividend.  Speculation returns come through capital growth.  So yes, it is speculation, according to that definition. Just like gold or any currency holding.  Or, indeed, almost every derivative in the world, the market size of which is vastly greater than all other markets in the world combined. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 15:53:32
It really just looks like a slide into dictatorship.  It makes me very sad.  
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:58:27


Without the nodes, you have nothing.


No, bitcoin has [over 80 thousand node users]( that use core ref clients.  No other crypto comes even close.  It's called 'decentralization' laddy.  Look it up.


So now the hard-fork is the non-hard-fork, and the tens of thousands of current users of bitcoin are the people who have hard-forked by doing nothing?  You're confused.
But hey, if you wanna follow bitmain onto the china-coin hard-fork, I aint gonna stop ya.  Like BU, you'll have to install their node-client.  Let me know how THAT works out for ya.
@_date: 2016-07-31 06:18:35
So you want to re-define the definition of 'no-one' to not include people, because it doesn't suit your narrative?  Bravo.  That's the kind of brain-dead logic that thrives upon.
@_date: 2016-07-30 01:15:49
I like the mod policy here.  I don't want the crazy nutjob pollution to infect this place again. 
is just a whiny little bitch. He has been on the losing end of another position (this time eth/etc) and he's having a big old sook because he can't hide it.  Yeah... let's let corporate interests define acceptable moderation policy. Thats a great high-dea.
@_date: 2017-06-21 04:55:43
I  don't mean use by running but use as in make and accept transactions with it?
@_date: 2017-06-18 05:09:02


I said no such thing. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:03:55
If they want to produce blocks that meet the requirements of the nodes, then it isn't a hard-fork, is it?  If it is, then clearly they're not meeting the requirements of the nodes, and it doesn't matter what they do, because the nodes will reject them.
I'll translate it for you :
Derpity derp derp, hurr derpy hurr.
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:06:57
Isn't Luke Dashjr also one of the most vocal proponents of the segwit upgrade that over doubles the blocksize? Today?
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:26:07


Storage is not the problem.  Bandwidth is.
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:00:41
 I'll take the segwit.  You can keep the hard-fork part.
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:08:40
You install the china-coin hard-fork software if you like.  I'll just keep using bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:38:50
He's one of them strategically ignorant types.
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:40:22
Did you bother reading the analogy?  It doesn't look like it.  The type of fork has to do with the consensus mechanism, tightening vs loosening or removing.  It is this tightening, which protects the chain from malicious miners, that separates BIP148 from UASF in general.
It is a common misconception in the rbtc cesspool
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:19:57


Obviously not on how they work.
@_date: 2017-06-18 03:56:22


Yep.  That's why segwit itself is such a gamble in its blocksize increase.  If it was up to me, there'd be no blocksize increase at all.  Good thing there has been over a year of testing.  The nodes that define consensus in bitcoin overwhelmingly agree with my appetite for risk.
If you're happy with the status-quo with no changes at all, or just the malleability fix and the quadratic hashing bug fix, and the asicboost bug fix, I'm happy with that too.
See how this works?  The people who test their software and plan for its introduction with the least amount of risk to the system, are the ones that get the changes they plan.  The knuckle-draggin mouth-breathing flat-earther rbtc numpty-folk grunt and squeal, but that's all they do.
@_date: 2017-06-04 04:59:48
Yeah.  ok.  Love the support for UASF.  Reckon I'll still go elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:11:40


Which would require tens of thousands of node users to install the hard fork china-coin node client.  Ain't gonna happen. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 04:49:31


I'm totally cool with that.  Whatever it takes.  
I won't be installing the china-coin hard-fork client though.  If they want to have a hard-fork, it's going to take a couple of years minimum, and be done through the roll-out of the core reference client, if it is done at all.
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:52:37
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:36:15


yeah yeah... nah.  Think this through.  If there are less miners, you are less likely to have a block reward go to another miner no matter how long you hash for.  So the less miners there are, the more of a percentage of the blocks you will receive, for the same hashing effort.
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:07:00


Describe to me, exactly, how you think that this could occur?


Never gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:36:57


Not should be. Is. 
The ignorant are easily led. They like to feel like they are part of a tribe. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:10:59
Take it up with bitmain.  They are the ones blocking a blocksize increase. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:24:54
Nodes define consensus in bitcoin, not miners. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 03:40:27


Bitcoin is a consensus system which miners provide a block-hashing service for, nothing more.  It is the nodes that define consensus in bitcoin, not miners.  It is the nodes that specify the SHA-265 algorithm that that miners must employ for the block-hashing service, and it is the only the nodes that have the ability to change it.
@_date: 2017-07-21 23:01:08


Nodes define  and police consensus in bitcoin, not miners.
@_date: 2017-07-16 05:41:07
I'm one of the people that doesn't have anything against coinbase.  They are a business, and they offer a service that people are willing to pay for.  Good on em.
But if you don't control your private keys, you don't have bitcoin, you have an account.  Accounts can be closed.  Accounts can be frozen.  Accounts can have their funds stolen en-masse.  Accounts will have their transactions monitored.
Do not ever store your bitcoin on an exchange.  It is literally the number one rule of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:43:32
What's subtle about it?
@_date: 2016-07-31 08:05:58
You said :


I showed that Theymos IS supported, as demonstrated by the fact that I support him.  Ergo, he IS supported.


It's not supposed to be pleasant.  Pleasant doesn't work with people who don't think rationally.  All they do is use it as a justification for increasing the volume to drown out a dissenting opinion.  I don't subscribe to this method.  If someone says something stupid, I call them stupid.  It is easier to counter ignorant emotional people, so I use this method because I don't want to hear ignorant emotional people, and this is the most effective method of silencing them.  I make no apologies for it.
@_date: 2016-07-16 06:59:35
As said elsewhere :
must-read: 
It truly is a breathtaking book
@_date: 2017-06-20 06:32:42
What makes you think they won't?  And what happens if they don't?
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:47:14
Note the part where i love the people?  Reading comprehension much?  The fact is, you don't like the term china-coin because it effectively demonstrates the issue and you can't fkn stand it.
Boo!  china-coin!!!!
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:01:03


The price of bitcoin and the price people are willing to pay to use it disagrees with your assessment.
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:25:33
Which you can back up with a pen and paper.   Numpty. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:27:40
Jesus dude.  I think you need to extend your timelines.
@_date: 2017-06-21 02:12:31


The miners could fork the chain today if they were so confident that their hard-fork would work.
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:51:57
Need clarification?  Start [here](
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:36:06
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:07:08
It doesn't really make any difference if no-one except miners is going to install their software.
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:10:26
Feel free to provide an alternate solution if you feel like the current solution doesn't meet your needs.  See if you can get people to adopt your coin.  Not interested in China-coin myself. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:46:06


Leave then. You are mistaking you having an opinion as someone having an opinion worth considering. It's an almost exclusively an American failing.  You prefer the rbtc cesspool?  I'd prefer you to be there.  Win win. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:38:12


And that's what bitcoin is.   80,000 people that only trust themselves. 


Clearly you do not. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:33:15
Nah. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 03:33:59


It reduces the 'work' in 'proof of work'.  So it undermines the fact that work has been done at all, and that 'proof' isn't proof at all.
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:08:25


Let me know when you're done.  I'll just keep using bitcoin until then.
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:46:25
A it sounds like someone has hurt your feewings.
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:05:02
Bitmain is the one blocking a blocksize increase.  They always have been.  Take it up with them. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:15:07


I said no such thing.  I said :


Surely the people involved 'at the beginning' were the people who created the code, yes?
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:18:50
Which increases fees for the segwit miners. They make out like bandits. More txns per block and less miners. Which incentivizes more miners to join. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:11:03


Says a cheer-leader for china-coin.


That's segwit.  Being blocked by bitmain.  Take it up with them.
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:48:36
And THAT's how you get an emergency PoW change that renders all of their hardware obsolete.  And they know it.

It's just not going to happen.  I'll thank em for the segwit if it happens though.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:38:13


80,000+ core ref nodes says otherwise.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:03:38


The price of bitcoin, and the price people are willing to pay to use it, disagrees with that assertion.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:05:43
I'm not the sock-puppet snowflake.
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:52:06
Dammit dammit dammit.  I've missed sarcasm again haven't i?
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:49:03


That is never ever going to happen.
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:13:51
Because then miners will increase the blocksize to force nodes off of the network, enabling them to make any further changes whenever they want to.  It is miners not controlling the nodes that is the only reason bitcoin is decentralized. 
@_date: 2016-07-30 05:29:50
Bitcoin isn't a get-rich-quick scheme.  It's model is built on the premise that fiat currencies will inflate (by design) and bitcoin won't (by design).  So it retains its value over the long-term.
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:22:08


Really?  So what happens when I want to store my cat videos on the block-chain?
You really don't know how this whole bitcoin thing works, do you?
@_date: 2017-06-19 09:08:37
Good on ya.  Good thing core is still in charge, or you wouldn't even have that.
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:49:12
Nodes define consensus in bitcoin, not miners.  In order for a hard-fork to be successful effectively ALL of the nodes have to be upgraded to the new hard-fork client. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:41:39


segwit is the compomise.  Not interested in a hard-fork thanks.  You can hard-fork to china-coin if you want.

It would have to be.  In order for it not to be, the tens of thousands of nodes that signal segwit would need to have their node client changed to something that doesn't disable it.

No, it is what the nodes, i.e. the users do.

That's because you don't know what a node is, nor what a node does.
