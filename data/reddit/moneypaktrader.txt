it pays 5% with 2% extra if you follow the instructions in the bitcointalk forum before registering your account.

We have some feedback on bitcointalk and bitcoinotc

It was a little under 10 BTC, includes some backend you don't see.

Good point, maybe you should avoid using moneypaktrader.com for submitting your moneypaks for bitcoins. 
You gotta admit +5% moneypaks in exchange for your bitcoins is a GREAT deal, RIGHT!?!?

Yes, the MP loaded is 5% over market rate for the btc spent.
BTCPak is the opposite, don't know exactly what their rate is because BTCPak was empty last time I checked.

I sell USD moneypaks with 5% more value than the bitcoins paid: moneypaktrader.com

I see what your saying, but you gotta admit getting 5% MORE moneypak for your bitcoins at moneypaktrader.com MIGHT be considered a better deal compared to PAYING a fee to get moneypaks at btcpak or whatever, right?!?!?

Hello, I'm looking to give 1 BTC in load credit on my site to a positive reposting of this advertisement that gets at least 50 net positive and is helpful in soliciting business. My second advertisement was a failure as you can see. I have several $1K MP's available to load, so message me when you post the ad so I can comment that in (and help with the upvotes). Thanks for all the positivity, it's been rough with all the haters on here that want to discriminate against me for helping SR users buy bitcoins (just like bitinstant does!).

Here's the link to bitcointalk, since some of the moneypaktrader.com customers use that and some of them left reviews in bitcointalk.
Also, there's a lot of speculation which you can see that might influence your decision, in case people don't cross-post that speculation to reddit here
