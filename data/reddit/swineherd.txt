So what, I could leave 10 machines signed into it with 10 different accounts and get 0.1BTC per day? How?

They appeared! Whew! Thanks for the patient guiding hand, appreciated:)
How do I set up tipping with comments?:)

You'll get about 120Mh/s out of your card, which will basically earn you nothing. The cost of electricity will outstrip what you make in bitcoins. To compete over the coming months, you're going to need application specific hardware that processes in the realms of tens of Gh/s.

The bitcoins I bought a week ago are still worth more now than they were then. I'll continue to hold on to them.

Rather than spending, I'm gifting to and educating friends and family - that way ultimately more people can spend:)

I will pour myself a drink when I get home and refresh periodically - considering them a write off for now tho, that way if they turn up it'll be a nice surprise:)

If the way you use bitcoin is massively influenced by seconds of trading, you're using bitcoin wrongly.
