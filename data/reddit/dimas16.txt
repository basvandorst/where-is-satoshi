I think having a villain to be weary of unifies countries making it nearly impossible for any nation to do something drastic( kind of like during the cold war). Remember how during ww2 USA had a nuclear bomb while no one else had one? Remember what they dis with that thing? Twice. That would never have happened if other powerful nations had one as well.

You only pay capital taxes on capital that is greater than 25k€. In that case you pay 30% tax of 3% of your capital. There are no taxes for trading crypto.

I feel like people are sleeping on the tax haven that is the Netherlands, especially for crypto.
