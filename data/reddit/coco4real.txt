That’s what it was for my initial investment. With these crazy gains it’s now about a third of all my investments. Thinking about possibly selling some off to bring it back down to 20%

I just got laid off work about a month ago. I don’t have a lot invested (3 months living expenses) but during the huge drop I realized I’m not currently willing to lose what I’ve gained for the sake of my family. Sold off a 3rd of my holdings at 13k and of course in hindsight know that wasn’t the best idea, but I still tripled that initial money invested and still have some on the table. 
I don’t think there’s anything wrong with selling a bit off if it helps you sleep at night, you just need to live with your decisions and not regret anything. 
I have an extra month of cash sitting in my emergency fund now in case I need it and I can always invest more when I land my next gig.

Just sold off a little bit so that bitcoin is now 23% of my entire investment portfolio. Feels good to capitalize on the massive gains and still have enough  holdings in BTC to see some nice profit. Maybe if it drops I’ll throw more cash in but I’m a happy camper for now

Im actually up 29.2% on my non crypto investments. Just good ETFs. Betterment has honestly been amazing for me and has gotten 23% of that this year

Bought ETH and LTC 6 or 7 months ago and sold them recently for a nice profit. BTC is my girl
Not invested in any other cryptos now but looking at Monero. Just quit my job 2 weeks ago and that’s why I’m more heavily considering the rebalance

probably should add that I wouldn’t be losing a lot of money if it all went away tomorrow. Just trying to be smart with my holdings. God I love this ride.

They handle all of it! It’s honestly such an easy and efficient way to invest and basically the same as vanguard. I think the fees might be slightly lower but I’m sure it’s fine. 
Great job on the emergency fund!

Haha I saw that! That’s why I figured I’d clarify. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:27:55
Just did and feel great about it. I feel bad for all of the friends who didn’t listen to me screaming at them to buy 6 months ago!

I’m only 25 so I can handle a lot of risk. Just wondering where my limit should be. 
60% seems like a lot man. I don’t see the harm in securing at least some of the gains and pulling it back to 40%. You’ll still have a lot of BTC working for you. Either way, my thought process is that if I’m losing sleep I’m too heavily invested.... I’m not there yet but I’m wondering when it’ll start.
If you’re still getting that good baby sleep let it ride!

My fear is a ton of shorting will drive the price down. I really have faith in the tech behind it but wall street is a bitch and I know that market manipulation is very real.

Just sold off a little bit. Taking gains never hurt anyone. A win is a win. 
Selling at 14k when I bought in at 4K seems like a good deal in my book!

Well my other investments and etfs made about 23% return this year so they are doing just fine. Bitcoin is just a rocket ship to the top and is my high risk high reward investment.

 I personally just threw more money at it. Always ready for it to fall back below $1000 though. I really have faith in the tech so holding is easier and it's not money I can't lose. 
Keeping only 10% of my investments in risky spots helps me sleep at night.

omg same, the hype is real.
