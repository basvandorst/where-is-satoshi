Any help would be greatly appreciated.

**Thankyou** I was freaking out a bit there.  
Seems like Dropbox does not like restoring keys. I just downloaded them to my **SD** and then restored from inside the app itself. Worked lovely.

Okay thanks, I'll download it from my dropbox and try restoring from there.

At the moment now, I downloaded bitcoin-qt, transferred all my coins from mobile to desktop and then backed up the .DAT file to a truecrypt volume I have on a USB stick.

Also just to ask, why use a desktop app or web app and not my phone? Surely having it on my phone means I can make/receive payments anywhere?
@_date: 2014-05-18 14:57:51
Nope. Don't know how I would go about doing that.  
I feel stupid now.

I don't see why Ebay, the huge place it is seems to have this happen often.

Isn't it wierd that the banks in the UK are the ones who are bieng resistant to Bitcoin in the first place?
@_date: 2015-02-27 18:14:58
It should have always used Bitcoin in my opinion...

@_date: 2013-06-07 05:26:45
