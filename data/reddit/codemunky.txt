Find the transaction on blockchain.info

Actually, it's not free.  1% or $30/month.  Cheap, but not free.  And considering the freeness of bitcoin transactions, it's actually a bit steep, imho.  Especially when rolling your own is pretty simple.

There's still massive gains to be made, and no guarantee that it'll ever drop below $700 again.  If it was me I'd rather buy now, than risk it getting to $1000 and thinking "I wish I'd bought a month ago"

I feel like you've not addressed my concerns about the size of the blockchain at all, and have instead assumed that I'm a complete noob which thinks I have to have bitcoin QT to use bitcoin.  Which I'm not.

£3.50 is typical, $5.60

Don't people generally believe that bitcoin is going up in value a lot, and will continue to do so for a fair while yet?
If so, why would you ever want to spend any bitcoins?  Surely put whatever cash you can afford to risk into it, and leave it there?
I mean if you were spending them on illegal goods I'd understand, but on a takeaway?  I don't see the point.
I wan't to see the point though, as I'm toying with implementing bitcoin transactions on my own site.  I'm just not convinced anyone would want to pay with them!

This is what I've been doing.  It bit me in the ass last night though, when I clicked on an add at one price, and ended up paying a much worse rate, and I didn't realise until the coins came through this morning.  Make sure you double check that the rate hasn't changed in the same instant that you clicked into the ad!

I almost thought they were hinting at it in the most recent episode.  Cartman's poster with the wizard and PS4 and Xbox1 on it strongly reminded me of 
I had to pause it, and go and load that picture up, to check to see if it was a reference.  Alas I think not, just coincidentally similar.

Well, half a beer maybe...
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:57:09
Well, it certainly seems like it could be that simple.  Generate a unique address for each shopping cart.  Then just need a way of checking that the payment has been sent.  I assume blockchain.info or similar has an API for checking that sort of thing.

I'm confused. 
I can check the balance of my paper wallets by going to blockchain.info/address/mywalletID.
The "watch only" thing is only if I created a wallet ON blockchain, yes?
So using my paper wallets without having a blockchain wallet of the same address is ok, yeah?
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:18:16
Ah so he has a blockchain wallet that is simply a list of all his bitcoin addresses?  I getcha.
@_date: 2013-11-12 13:07:07
Yeah I know it's not, and that the FAQ even strongly advises against that.  But the general vibe I get from this subreddit is "my preccccious" :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:43:25
Yes.  I think we just need the big exchanges to switch, which should be simple, and everyone else will follow suit.
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:47:43
Well, let's do that.  I will now refer to it as mBTC in any conversations i have on here, or with friends etc on Facebook.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:00:07
Do we trust  ?
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:32:36
Whoops.  I'm tired :)
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:58:46
Yes, it can.
Do I think it will? No.

A 0.7BTC transaction I just did (with 0.0001 fee) is saying 40 hours to confirmation with 7000 txs in the queue. And that number is going up :(
