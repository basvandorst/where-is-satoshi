As much as this subreddit loves to hate on Coinbase, I have never had any problems with them. I've been using them since 2015.

Aubrey de Grey is doing an AMA on on December 7th. This would be a perfect opportunity to combo!

Yes it can. I didn't see him try to mine for blocks. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:46:26
Yup, I think we're next. $970 as of writing.

You probably ought to add Ontario, Canada after Kitchener.

Hah, I'm not the only one who saw that.

Unfortunately I had a hard time finding actual detail on how it was implemented on miners, but your second comment clears up things for me.
Thank you for the answer!

Interesting. So ASICBoost miners ship with the necessary circuitry to create normal blocks?
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:39:50
So, I guess I'm a bit confused then. 
According to asicboost.com:


This to me implies that there is some circuitry missing to continue functioning on the segwit chain.

No idea, but I've given out my email address to too many btc related sites.

Goddammit, that and all of our hockey hullabaloo.

Yup, I've already done that, so I have the contact information. I sent an email to butterfly labs to request that they refund me, so I'll give that 24h first.

So I need some opinions. 
I ordered a jally in May 2013, and I swear I remember reading that they expect to be caught up by the end of August 2013 when I ordered. I even jumped on the 2GH/s upgrade. It's now 1/2 through September, and they're only at Feb 14th orders, and they don't appear moving. 
Is there any point in waiting for the device to ship? I feel like I'll never make my money back on the hardware. Should I try and get a refund?
@_date: 2013-09-18 19:45:49
Got myself a refund too for a Jally from May 2013.
Thanks Tharlam!

I doubt they're able to anymore. I'm pretty sure there's a nice black mark on BFL.
