I've had no problem with coin base. Just make sure you understand how long wire transfers take and when buying with a debt card. I think ppl freak out bc it's not instantly in their account.

I work in oil and gas, and fossils fuels are not going away any time soon because of two simple facts. 1 world population is increasing 2. As world populations increases, the need for cheap, reliable energy will also increase. And gasoline only makes up a fraction of the total products that come from petroleum.
