Well this is the key then.  I didn't even know this existed.  
I know the built in QuickBooks payment system lets you accept Bitcoin.  The bitpay side let's you concert to cash for 1%, which is nice so businesses don't have to worry about both the tax implications of Bitcoin and the security of holding it.
They also let you use coinbase commerce , but I am not sure if that let's you convert to fiat, I have to investigate personally.  
Note: these features are in the "labs" settings.

No, that 2300 is the average of all mined Bitcoin this year. 
The price is now 2700 as of q2 averages.  We are in Q3.  More than likely we are about 3200 each bitcoin by end of Q3.  I'm guessing 3800 by end of Q4. 
So, yes, price can still go down.  But at least we know.... Some of the floors that exist, and when.

When a businessman states that Bitcoin is a bubble. .. you should think, "is he right"? Because he was.  20k to 5.8k is an obvious bubble.

Yes that's good.  Don't do hardware wallets.  They have been known to have firmware hacks, plus, you are required to write down the seed on paper anyway with one, which makes the point mute. 
You don't need multiple Bitcoin addresses though, they all go to the same seed word.  Unless you want to track your deposits into separate "buckets".

And if you want a multi coin wallet, try coinomi.  It's not open source anymore, but they do segwit well and it has been solid for the year I've been using it heavily. 
They aren't the fastest in getting new features, (took 5 months for segwit) (and it's been almost 2 years for monero) but it is my favorite wallet.  
Samurai is nice too, but it has SO many features, I'm trying to grasp them all.

They were having issues with clones going in the playstore with malware.  
They do invite outside security people to visit and review the code.
To be honest, even open source, anything on the playstore is vulnerable to not using that code.

They say no fees.  Prob not forever, maybe one day they'll charge..... But now, no fees.
Remember, you aren't getting cash back, or credit card rewards, so, if you spend 100 bucks, coinbase gets a buck or two, not you.
But... As far as converting bitcoin to cash, ya.... Zero fee. 
Fees are listed here....
Basically, only fees for using overseas.... And an ATM fee for taking out cash.  (Which is actually low considering instant money if you need in an emergency)..

Not really.  The blockchain size will grow, but maybe not linearly.  Currently, it is linear.  But at some point, the blocksize will go up.

Just a heads-up, don't use credit card, and don't use coinbase. Use coinbase pro and do a bank ACH transfer.  Credit cards tack on fees.
ACH takes a few days to transfer, almost a week, but if you aren't in a hurry this is how you can avoid fees.

I agree.  The main problem I see, is "can't receive til you spend".  
There needs to be a free/cheap instant solution.  Lots of solutions are like "oh we only take a percent to open a channel with you".  Oh, so you are a bank.  Cool. 
I don't know what the solution is.... Can you open half channels?  So like if you open a channel with 1BTC.  You get two channels. One from you, one to you.   Each open at half so it totals the full amount?

If they use quickbooks online, it has support under the "labs" section.
You gotta use either coinbase ecommerce of bitpay.  Bitpay doesn't work with a lot of wallets though...
So, its integrated into the payment system where they can pay back e-check, credit card, or bitcoin. 
 
Makes it easy for non-tech users.  I think bitpay lets you get the bitcoin automaticallly converted to USD at a 1% fee, which is less than a credit card fee, so thats nice.  I'm not sure if coinbase lets you convert to USD.  (its hard to recommend SMALL businesses hold onto bitcoin due to the tax consequences.

And use the website.  Pro.coinbase.com don't use the app or the consumer site.   Pro site (old gdax) gets lower fees.

@_date: 2019-09-12 18:25:06
It seems fair.  At least it simplifies things.  If also like a "minimum" too.  Like, gains over 1000 or something, which would be nice for spending cash.

Why not binance?  I thought they are always proactive and a good player.
Also, there was a chart earlier that showed all the exchanges and which ones batch transactions and which ones had segwit.  
Isn't batching more important as it puts more transactions in a block than segwit transactions individually?
