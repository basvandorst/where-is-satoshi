Why do i feel like Jörg just rocked me ever so sweetly in his bosom. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:58:19
Cute. You heard a term and now repeat it...but fail recognize that it is human nature to have or complete a portion. How is that a myth?  Or stupid?  
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:42:50
Exactly. Lets be real....how many of you commented "great job bro", "thanks man", "he built a sweet app". You wouldn't have known if it wasnt said.  Think abt your assumptions when you comment.

Hmmm...any dating site ICOs on the horizon???
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:12:02
Sounds like you're being primed to be the fall guy.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:06:28
Nope. I dont think Bitcoin was invented to make one person(s) rich. While a majority of society may find that concept difficult to grasp...i think they wanted to simply be the catalyst for exactly what we see happening right now. Thats it.

I see what you did there. Nice.

**Google knows:** where i go, what i buy, what i watch, what i say, temperature of my living room, who i'm with, even what i'm about to do...but i'm sorry, they need to keep their rainbow colored hands off my moolah!!

If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:43:03
Not sure where you're looking to get...but every now and then its ok to look up in the rearview and see how far you've come.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:43:07
If $18k is the number you're comfortable at selling great. Now...dont sell....keep collecting your gains....and if price starts to fall...sell when you get back to this point on the way down. Why get off the ride while its still going up?????
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:23:24
Easy guys....not intended to be any proclamation. Just simply a moment of reflection on all of the hurdles we've bounced over. Damn....can we just take a moment a enjoy how far we've come??!!!

If you are new you probably are looking for a little more gdax "how to".  From gdax go to Bitcoin balances and the click deposit. Your Coinbase BTC wallet balance should prefill. You can deposit as much as you want (no charge)...then you can transfer from your new gdax balance to your Binance deposit account (again for no fee).  You might want to consider replacing Coinbase with Gemini in the future. 
Edit: and if you already know all this cool...maybe this can help someone else trying to figure it out.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:34:55
Sure...right now the entire world has an alternative to fiat and five years ago that just a dream. With so many outlets talking about BTC tonight it just hit home on how much of a disruptor this really is. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:03:41
Thats cowGIRL.....thank you kindly.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:39:41
Can we atleast have proof of life? I'm legit worried about you right now...
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:06:12

Too legit to quit.

TLDR: A major gold and silver fund is slotting five percent of its portfolio toward bitcoins, wanting to capitalize on “digital gold” and the Bitcoin boom.

Every single night...no exaggeration....
12:00 am: "Babe....im not texting...just gotta check something..."
1:30 am: "I'll just be a sec...I'm turning the brightness down...shh...go back to sleep"
3:00 am: *staring at phone on nightstand* 
3:08 am: *still staring at phone on nightstand*
- falls asleep at some point -
6:30 am: Wake up and catchup on BTC news till alarm goes off at 7
This IS a sickness!!!
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:26:33
Thank you. The assumption that we aren't here is incredibly annoying.
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:17:45
Cause there's literally no turning back at this point.
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:10:11

Just filed via TurboTax and this was helpful. No option to upload 8949 but they give an address to mail it in. After you submit your returns, a popup and reminder appears with the forms you need to print out and send in with your 8949. Not nearly as difficult as I expected.... thanks again!

Russia and N.Korea using crypto to avoid sanctions....looks like regulators don't feel they have oversight/jurisdiction...committe is interested in more discussions/focus there.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:16:20
Yes...and big shout out to his niece (30y/o) that he referenced.  She's been schooling him on BTC. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:51:02
My take: focus on fraud, regulating ICOs, regulating exchanges, SEC building up their cryoto teams with more experts, increased coordination between agencies, consumer education, coordinate laws with other countries, increase understanding of crypto and future state. Committee seems in over their head and many just asking questions based on news headlines.

How about we just dont embarrass them with all the lambos &amp; moon memes.
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:08:42
Sure they are....and the wall...and taxes...and guns....and immigration....and infrastructure....and election meddling...and....fck, just pick something and finish it already!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:08:24
I get it. I'm just saying while they are out there trying to make a case for what we're doing here...lets not be the kid that keeps fckg up and embarrassing their parents by doing dumb shyt. Ie: "lambos to the moon bro"
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:10:29
Its been a while..but i also efiled with the online version. Try using the search feature in TT to locate the form and address. I mailed in the 8949 and got my refund within 3 weeks with no issues. If you paid extra for support/protection you can also call them directly for assistance.
