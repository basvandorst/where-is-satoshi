LPPL isn’t a form of technical analysis. Rather it is a projection into the time domain of a ever-greater correlation occurring between market participants leading to a rupture event.

Right at the end it turns out that he isn’t exposed to bitcoin at all. Quite amusing.

I manage the family business, which I have built into a trans-European corporation. I'm quite content, and focussed, on that. I might have a knack for finance (sometimes) but I consider running a business that actually employs people and allows them to lead a dignified life is a more purposeful way of spending my time. Notice that I didn't even do the LPPL analysis myself: I just wrote a discussion of why I thought bitcoin was economically unsound, and then found somebody that had already done the mathematical leg-work in a manner that I reckoned sound. I literally couldn’t even be bothered to sit down and use Excel for an afternoon to do these calculations. (That said, I have used LPPL in the past, for purposes more relevant to my business, such as estimating shifts in prices of commodities the company needs to purchase.)
I don't earn a salary (per se) but collect very comfortable dividends with plenty of zeros, which (given the inherent risk of entrepreneurship) I invest into extraordinarily boring bonds and things like that.
I'm here on reddit because as of this morning I'm on holiday, and would need to find another way of distracting myself otherwise.
As for my written English, I learnt most of it by reading books, so I have definitely a scholastic (and likely pedantic) tone.

Good, difficult question that makes me squirm (for all the right reasons, namely that I understand that unambiguous quantitative answers with no wriggle room is how one puts one’s money where one’s mouth is).
First, a clarification: the LPPL projection was not mine, but it is a method I support and a work I fully endorse (for what that’s worth; I just don’t want to get credit for work that isn’t mine).
And now the answer: does it satisfy you if I say that I expect that 19,666 USD/BTC will forever remain the all-time high?

If people recognise cryptocurrencies for what they truly are (a clever manner of *manufacturing scarcity* in our infinitely-duplicatable digital info-sphere) and decide to attribute a value to them on that basis alone, then I'm fine with it.

I run a company (the family business) and I had studied applied mathematics and economics (specialised in financial markets and game theory), so I intend ”practicing macroeconomist” in that sense.
Why do you wish to ”test me”? I wrote an article. I linked to predictions made with a technique I consider valid, and the predictions turned out to be fairly accurate. So what makes you think that I care much whether I achieve more or less credibility in your eyes? Honestly I’m just posting on reddit about something I am very mildly interested in because as of this morning I’m on holiday and I’m pretty bored.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:56:04
Yeah, exactly, and provided everybody that participates in the market *knows* they are the equivalent of rare stamps, and can't be used to buy food and pay rent with, that's fine.

Comparing the appreciation of an asset or market capitalisation to the growth of an economy is so wrongheaded I don’t know where to start.

I am a practicing macroeconomist and I have expressed deep reservations about bitcoin (generally, any currency, including crypto-currencies, that have a finite supply [as I tried to explain in this piece I wrote recently]( I wish to add that I have no position in any cryptocurrency nor affiliation thereto, and don't plan to.
[I’ve posted on reddit about this before]( and have had mixed responses (as one could reasonably expect). 
I am always extraordinarily suspicious of any explanation of a large market movement (downwards or upwards) that is attributed to somebody saying or doing something. The reason is it's fair that there be a few market participants are so uncertain about the value of their assets and their prospective evolution that they react suddenly, but if the market is so shallow that apparently *most* participants just react to technical trends, then you have a problem.
I wish also to add that the market turning “just about now” had been predicted quite a long time out (30 November) on the public record by the application of the well-known financial model [Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) to the BTY/USD exchange rate]( Spoiler: with no reference to strange conspiracy theories *nor to the introduction of derivatives*, based on analysis of the time-series up to 30 November alone, they predicted a maximum USD/BTC of about $21,000 between 24 December 2017 and 8 January 2018, and an ensuing heavy ‘crash’. I'd say they weren't far off.
So no, bitcoin did not tank because some “idiot swede” said something inopportune. It tanked because the market was totally disconnected from reality (and has been for ages, maybe forever), and because apparently a large proportion of participants are trading purely on technical and not fundamental valuations, and therefore act in unison and pro-cyclically in a shallow and illiquid market. Add to this that it is probably noxious for any economy to adopt a fixed-quantity, deflationary currency, and... there you have it.

I’m sorry my command of written English (which isn’t even my first language) upsets you. I’m sure you’ll be able to live with it, in due time.

The exact answer to your question is “no, I am not” (mainly because I am largely unenthused by the idea of accumulating ‘karma’ for who-knows-what-purpose), but more broadly, I do not understand what point you are trying to make. Quite frankly I wasn't even aware of having undermined my argument.

I’ve never read a definition but I just assume it stands in for ”Hold On for Dear Life”.

It was actually a deliberate decision by the devolved Greenland polity so that they would not become subject to EU fisheries law.

It being ”the first” in the currency picker actually means it's the furthest you have to reach, and thus the least ergonimic, which implies they reckon it'll be the least often used.

If it’s legal in Denmark I don’t see why Greenland shouldn’t be *ahem* coloured green.

Well... if it’s *terra nullis* there’s no governing law so it can’t be either legal or illegal, so it’s up to those there to transact as they wish. As for the high seas, maritime law probably applies, so in practice probably the same. IANAL

Most of those whom you describe as needing to ”financially commit” to having internet service at their homes actually were accessing it through their workplaces (businesses or research institutions). I was there, doing that, too.

“*Could become*” is just the opposite of “*might not be*”, it doesn't really mean much.
Besides, the quoted 2% current rate of adoption is wildly misleading, particularly in terms of comparison, because 2% of a population *using* the internet as a medium of communication and 2% *owning* some quantity of bitcoin but not transacting with it are wildly different, and not even remotely comparable, metrics.
