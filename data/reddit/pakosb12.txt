Exactly I'm required to get 750 visits to the article for class. It's a social media marketing project. Thanks for the view!

Well I guess I can consider myself one of those lucky 15 million! I just was pondering how long it will take to be widespread enough that there isn't a possibility for people to obtain significant amounts.

It's not that rare to own one Bitcoin. Im still in college and own at least one. I'm just thinking the point were it's pretty much impossible for a person to buy or earn an entire Bitcoin.

I think it is because if they become widely adopted which I believe they will that their value will increase to the point that most people can't afford them. Right now most American or European middle income families can easily but at least 1 Bitcoin if not several.

Thanks! I'm checking out some of these sites now. I'm not into coding or tech enough for a lot of the freelance projects but, I can try and find something.

Isn't it a possibility that they are testing the new chip?

Okay so I saw this post and thought it was a good idea. After seeing your opinion I'm inclined to stay away. Is there any other companies that offer this? I know coinbase is similar but you have to keep the coins in your wallet with them. Any better options?

So if computing was far enough along hypothetically someone could crack one of those wallets and steal the $2 billion? Seems like a hole in the technology.
I have around 10-15 bitcoins but I was just curious how those lost/missing coins could potentially affect the market if found.

Is there any way to tell how many are still in use? I feel like it would be hard to tell. If so many are lost wouldn't that rise the value even further.

You need 20,000 satoshi for it to cash out on Tuesdays. That's not her to achieve though

It's not spamming. I've never posted it before and it actually works. It's my favorite faucet and I wanted to share with the community.
