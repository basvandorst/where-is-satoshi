I highly doubt that...

Well, yeah, every donkey with an iphone was buying it? But now...

Store of wealth? Plenty of safer options than Bitcoin!

So, you think it'll get resurrected at some point? Do you know something I don't? Have they fixed its scaling issues? 
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:37:57
Well, once Bitcoins tanks, yeah. But do research Kin first.

Please... lol

Not at all. I only buy Kin. And very shortly (when Bitcoin tanks some more) I'll be buying more :)
Argue properly. Why, when the world has been made aware of Bitcoin, did it not take off? Oh, it doesn't scale/ You know, that little teeny weeny issue. Honestly, quit speculating on nothing.

He's a dick.

Well, yeah, it kinda did die didn't it? Certainly in the eyes of your average Joe. And, erm, he and his friends are who put your Bitcoin up to 19k. But heck, what do I know...

I'm not shilling anything. And me mentioning Kin was an aside and it is probably the most safest bet out there. About as far from a shitcoin as you can get. But don't just take my word for it, look it up! No, my point was that people thinking Bitcoin will surpass its ATH aren't thinking straight.  What use is saying its up 600% from last year if it's going to tank?
