Sounds like you're just trying to buy cheap rather than give good advice

This has been posted more times than Gox has crashed.... And that's pretty hard to beat.

Umm, what? I don't want any tips. Really, I don't have any background info. I bought my bitcoins a few weeks ago, and I haven't touched them since. I haven't logged into my account in a few weeks. Then I get an email saying my funds have been withdrawn, and if it wasn't me, to reply to the email immediately, which I did (two minutes after I got the email). Then they send me [this]( saying they can't do anything. Oh well I guess.....

Cool story bro

Actually, it only prohibits states from coining money. Also, the dollar is not unconstitutional. The Constitution gives Congress the power to create and regulate currency. The gold and silver is directed at the states, not the federal government.

So you're not even following your own financial advice? GG.....

I use Chrome for bitcoin stuff, and Firefox for everything else. My OS is Windows 7. I didn't use 2 factor. My Facebook and Gmail recently had attempts to log into them, but those attempts were from an IP in California. The Bitcoin hack was from a Chinese IP. I understand they could be using a proxy, but I really don't think they were related since Facebook/Gmail hacks were done about a week ago.

So you've sold all your coins, and you're not buying in again at $40-50?

Well I changed the password on a Mac (I think my PC was compromised) so hopefully that helps. I guess I should have stored my funds somewhere else --- but I was planning on withdrawing them really soon.

It's a decentralized currency. Not having authorities is one of the main points...

The same thing that happened all night.... The market isn't stable yet.

No, I changed my password with my laptop as soon as my funds were withdrawn, because if the hack came from a keylogger on my end, it would have been on my desktop. So hopefully my laptop is not compromised and they won't be able to do anything else.
