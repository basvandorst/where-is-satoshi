You can't buy USD-» Btc through pro. Even if you could they would put a fee.

If i'm not mistaken those are brainwallets. Known for it's insecurity 'cause lots of people lost their money that way thinking it was 'secure' making their own seed phrase.

You're handsome boiiiii
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:46:35
Do you think this can happen as well on hard wallets? Like trezor and nano s? 
So the best way to cope with this is to be really cautious and see if their pages are legit.
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:30:04
Very smart. I wonder why the big exchanges do not list privacy coins. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 06:29:39
Who even buys from third parties? Even if it was tampered they need it physical.
@_date: 2018-12-13 11:41:09
How u know that?
@_date: 2018-12-27 11:15:59
So if this is correct you created a seed on a computer with malware? How else can they know the seeds you used. Unless the seed was utterly simple
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:15:52
Was the download link bringing you to the official Site?
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:11:49
That's why you have the back up 24-keyseeds
@_date: 2018-12-30 21:20:36
Well your hardwallers are like paper wallets now. Don't let anyone near it and you're safe.
@_date: 2018-12-25 13:28:59
If you google btc wallets and if you look closely enough you can see that it is stated that those are the hard wallets of the exchanges. I do not guess. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 16:17:13
He sold?
@_date: 2018-12-31 11:50:40
Hmm nice, I think ill use the Binance DEX when it's ready. Thanks 4 the reply
@_date: 2018-12-27 11:00:50
Why are you in crypto then?
@_date: 2018-12-25 13:37:21
So i'm trying to understand if i'm correct we are able to see which adresses got those rewards and thus we can see if they moved their btc?
 And much likely most of those are his adresses because he tested it in the beginning. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 07:07:08
Which fiat to crypto exchanges would you highly recommend? Coinmama, bitstamp?
And if you send your btc through a wasabi wallet or cnvrt them to xmr and send it to another xmr wallet then they can't track it and you're safe even when you're using CB?
@_date: 2018-12-27 13:50:24
Hey, a newb here
how do you verify the signatures?
And how do you run your own node? 
Can these things also happen on Exodus wallet and hard wallets like trezor?
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:46:32
But when i receive a warning on my trezor to upd. I can see whether it is from satoshilabs or not? 
@_date: 2018-12-13 11:39:33
If it becomes the new Nwo-currency how would we be able to buy online? With creditcards you have proof. But with btc how can you proof that you're the owner? And if you for ex. Send a company btc over the internet how can you be sure they don't rip you off? Because you can't proof that you were the one that sent them. Please clarify 
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:38:12
If it says recv keys its from a hacker?
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:51:00
Why no arguments to back your claim? Everyone can call a coin a scam
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:10:27
Hey a newb here
Why is it easy to crack?
And with what standard should i go? Hard wallets?
@_date: 2018-12-21 07:02:28
You mean use Wasabi wallet to ''clean'' any trace that the btc is coming from you? 
What if you use Xmr adress to another (and then back?) to convert it btc?  
@_date: 2018-12-27 11:54:58
Oh my bad. But why would anyone use a wallet generated by humans?
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:42:44
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:54:50
That's why you write them down.
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:07:43
Exactly if you bought it from satoshilabs and you don't let anybody near it then your funds are just safe.
 Always see if the updates are posted on their official sites. But I think that the fake updates can only harm lite wallets and not hard wallets, unless someone proves me otherwise. 
@_date: 2019-05-09 14:22:01
Hate to say it but some truth here. Unless we learn from our mistakes and sell back (a portion) when we hit highs again
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:22:09
I know it's open source but what i meant was sending it anonymous without them knowing who you are. Thus not an ID attached to your adress.
