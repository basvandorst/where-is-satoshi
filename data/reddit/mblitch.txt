What app allows anyone to 'stream to FB' who would possibly use that it is posts to their social media in that way. That would be idiotic.

You specifically said "while you stream to Facebook".
Your statement is not correct. FB does NOT allow live streaming of anything from Bambuser. At most after the video stream is complete, a link to the content hosted on Bambuser can be shared. You tried to correct me in some way but your statement concerning 'privacy settings' is wholly irrelevant.

Again, no application 'streams' to Facebook. Videos may be shared later, after they are complete, but nothing is streaming to that social media site.

Uneraseable? You can delete a video through the app. As far as I know, it isn't recoverable once deleted. Bambuser should have the option of retaining footage for a while even if 'erased'.

I'm not trolling anything. It was a factually incorrect statement that should be corrected, and instead of admitting your ignorance, you just made ad hominem attacks. 
I know what the point of it is and have used it, so there is no need for you to create further straw man arguments. Why be so resistant to providing correct information or correcting someone when the inaccuracy is pointed out. 
You don't seem to know what trolling entails. It certainly isn't something that involves the mere correction of misinformation without the utterance of any inflammatory statements. I made no persona attacks, yet that seems to be the only way you can respond when you have no other defense.
