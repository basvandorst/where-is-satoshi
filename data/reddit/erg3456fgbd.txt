smartcards support 'write-only' memory.. that means you can write a private key to a smartcard and it can never be read back from the card. The card also supports signing transactions using the private key.. this signing happens on the card itself (it has to since the keys can't leave). This is nothing like an encrypted usb drive.. the key data is supposed to be impossible to get back out of the smartcard once it goes in (of course you can keep a backup before uploading it to the smartcard).  bitcoin is probably the first application that actually needs smartcards.. it's pretty much exactly why smartcards were invented infact.

The funny thing is that people don't see that the massive amount of press in western media is also a stamp of approval.

That has never been an option with bitstamp... it was with mtgox and intersango though. You can still fund bitstamp with a SEPA or regular wire transfer directly from most UK online banking.. the main downside is the bank's (usually terrible) GBP to EUR fx rates. It's not any more inconvenient than faster payments, it just costs more. People were using currencyfair in order to get better fx rates.

yes, this is the crucial thing.. I'm afraid I don't have the answer.. ECC smartcards are still pretty new.. it may be that there isn't anything suitable yet, but for sure there will be.

surprisingly easy;  a sheet of 16 x $50 = $800 costs $900 for a 12.5% markup -- with free shipping.  - of course you could just do a cash advance at any ATM too.

seems like they only exchange BTC to LTC to FTC - so no need to register with anyone or maintain bank accounts anywhere.

The right way to do this is to store the bitcoin wallet keys on an ECDSA smartcard. Preferably you would also have an external card reader with a pinpad to authorize each transaction to be signed by the smartcard.
