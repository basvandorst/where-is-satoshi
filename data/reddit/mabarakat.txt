Seems we are waiting for a big batch of apps that are needed to boost the current usability 
@_date: 2016-11-28 13:10:20
is it confirmed?
@_date: 2016-11-28 13:40:59
Very good point!
@_date: 2016-11-20 23:31:39
@_date: 2016-11-28 13:11:25
so are there any current updates to that list?
@_date: 2016-11-28 13:09:21
So from what I see it is not supported till today!
(Sorry to dig it up)
@_date: 2016-11-12 18:33:32
Central Bank of what !?
@_date: 2016-09-17 07:21:24
I for one did not have this information
@_date: 2016-09-15 03:17:06
Any one can easily send the spent BTC back to their own  wallet!
@_date: 2016-10-16 05:47:08
Blockbuster movie rental &amp; USPO are waiting for you WU!
@_date: 2016-10-04 02:40:37
Thanks, but there must be some thing up with me and finance!
I didn't understand AT ALL!
@_date: 2016-07-07 07:16:40
If big mining farms do offline as the hashing power is reduces so will the difficulty level, making smaller miners relevant again .
@_date: 2016-07-14 17:41:19
@_date: 2016-07-11 19:19:33
Great just hope it's not a

Very interested
Living in Heliopolis, Cairo.
@_date: 2016-07-09 13:52:33
How about:
" Hold my fiat, I'm hodling in "
Given that they hold fiat, we hodl BTC
@_date: 2016-07-03 15:59:28
I agree, but what kind of fight will the fiat monopoly/ gov. put?
I get scared thinking how far they may go.
@_date: 2016-07-11 01:16:43
Thanks :)
@_date: 2016-07-03 18:02:16
Where can you find the best BTC exchange rates?
I currently use Purse.io with about 14% more than market price.
As I can't find an exchange working in Egypt.
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:37:44
How about controlling/ influencing the big miners?
Only a handful now have almost 75% of hashing power &amp; voting power.
There are many weaklings but this I believe the weakest.
@_date: 2016-07-11 08:11:16
K, watching it now but 1:04 that is long ��
@_date: 2016-07-07 21:24:18
We need a bitcoin community here.
@_date: 2016-07-14 16:35:32
Come one these are like altcoins to ABB.
Be with the market leader :)-
@_date: 2016-07-03 18:12:17
Easy fellow.
Hold your horses. ��
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:20:18
OK if you were the governments/financial institutions and keeping you empire is dependant on killing/regulating the bitcoin....
What would you do and how far would you go?
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:21:49
That's what I fear, so I'm raising the topic.
No need to personalise the matter though :)
But try to read the "deflationary spiral" article on:
As shared in the first comment for a deeper understanding.
@_date: 2016-07-13 11:43:57
Oh really!
Still no public awareness on it yet?
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:49:16
Sounds balanced :)
@_date: 2016-07-09 05:23:20
I would totally agree if know there will be one :)
@_date: 2016-07-30 13:14:06
If you still have those I want to buy them if you are interested.
@_date: 2016-07-04 09:08:55
God !
I didn't get any information from the your reply above .
Are you a lawyer? :)
@_date: 2016-07-11 14:56:32
I am, but I just might be a little happier doing so after you "comforting" comment.
Just make sure no one would also hodl those last 1000 BTCs :)
@_date: 2016-07-22 18:18:42
Search YouTube for addiction in a nutshell.
You might get an other perspective on the WOD!
@_date: 2016-07-11 07:28:30
Sounds interesting.
I think studying economics is inevitable same as bitcoin code.
You just can't take their word for it 
@_date: 2016-07-14 17:59:29
Good question would like to know also :)
@_date: 2016-07-17 17:19:55
 
Well at least it's stable for now,
I believe we are mainly missing public awareness.
@_date: 2016-07-17 01:02:11
Will be interesting of people share their experience here, especially rates and coverage as you mentioned.
@_date: 2016-07-11 14:58:02
A nice political reply 
:b not an economic one 
@_date: 2016-07-11 08:13:45
I will let Mr. J P Morgan &amp; the Rothschild's reply to this one ��
@_date: 2016-07-09 08:45:40

@_date: 2016-07-11 00:55:55
@_date: 2016-07-30 13:16:09
+1 same here 
@_date: 2016-07-13 21:03:12
" but just enough centralization to eliminate redundancies" !!!?
@_date: 2016-07-08 06:46:09
I can't see such a dump back in the first 2012 halving
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:10:17
Which one?
I use XE &amp; coinbase 
But are not so good.
@_date: 2016-07-15 10:51:28
So they have to own the Bitcoin before selling the shares؟
 or they would wait until they get the money from selling the Share and then purchase to bitcoin with the liquidity !
@_date: 2016-07-18 10:30:13
So a poor man must sacrifice safety then!
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:53:39
Oh that simple.
Thanks :)
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:59:24
Also empty.
May be sensored? 
@_date: 2016-07-10 23:53:08
Pardon by ignorance, but why did see the subreddit empty even with 100k subscriptions &amp; 250 online?
@_date: 2016-07-11 15:11:25
OK let's be specific.
I buy laptop for 1BTC today worth 650$
Next  I replace the 1BTC for 650$+ premiums
I'm better off buying in $ in the first place.
But by doing so I'm cutting the premium from the BTC ecosystem and related companies.
A bitcoin user gains some a Bitcoin company looses some.
@_date: 2016-07-04 03:06:54
Are you sure bitcoin can not be "bent " even with decentralized condenses turning to centralised mining farms in China not so far away from 75% hashing &amp; voting power.
@_date: 2016-07-12 02:18:23
Deal, will be waiting for your invitation.
@_date: 2016-07-11 07:52:25
OK, but not 100% correct i think.
Hodling is not contrary to consuming, how about investing.
I ask you to make me a website to make a certain serves and pay you in BTC, it's not hurting the planet but can't be done if you prefer to hold the same amount speculating that the BTC in time will be more valuable than that new website returns!
I think you see where it's going.
@_date: 2016-07-11 14:35:35
Nicely said
@_date: 2016-07-03 11:22:04
God I must freshen up on my thermodynamics before I could even comment!
@_date: 2016-07-01 01:35:37
Well, I don't think I agree with that, if understood you well.
@_date: 2016-07-11 01:38:37
I get your point.
Just check the "Who Needs Merchants Anyway?"
Section in the second article mentions / updated in the OP now.
Kinda funny way of putting it.
@_date: 2016-07-14 16:33:33
I usually hate over ambition...
But really can feel genuine enthusiasm vibes just by reading your comments.
@_date: 2016-07-11 08:27:51
Of course you know that the top 1% have more wealth than the remaining 99% of individuals.
So the current system so so good for them but very bad for every one else.
That's what brought up the need for bitcoin in the first place.
@_date: 2016-07-03 15:49:30
Well 3K$ worth, as interesting it may be and as much as I believe in it, I still have to hold myself from jumping headfirst.
Can't afford to be broke  ��
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:26:44
Scary to think. If they start wars, drop bombs &amp; shed blood for some gains!
If the whole thing is jeopardized how ruthless will they be?
@_date: 2016-07-04 00:53:11
Nice one,[ with the sound of evil laugh]
@_date: 2016-07-15 10:54:50
Actually slow internet is also he root cause of my laziness :)
@_date: 2016-07-01 23:58:12
Quite inspiring,
feeling all geeky  after hearing that clip.
Well I feel I can't be wrong about bitcoin which is usually an alarming feeling always related to being naive.
The monopoly of money will never go out without a fight or even war.
@_date: 2016-07-14 10:01:11
Oh really a fellow bitcoiner that also works in drives.
I am a drives specialist in ABB, you work with which brands?
@_date: 2016-07-11 12:06:37
Well said.
As if they are saying: "sorry the economy can neither be logical nor fair "
@_date: 2016-07-03 18:51:41
How about controlling the big miners and forcing "regulation" or foreclosing them only a handful have 50% + of hashing power and votes
@_date: 2016-07-11 07:23:21
Sorry I didn't get this one. What did you mean?
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:45:25
But if you are a gold enthusiast which will help the gold market more.
Holding or spending?
That is the question :)
@_date: 2016-07-11 01:45:29
Very enlightening as usual.
Just out of curiosity is your background economic?
@_date: 2016-07-11 01:03:07
Or really, where can I get details ?
@_date: 2016-07-09 06:19:24
@_date: 2016-07-01 16:47:26
Super informative reply,
Thanks a lot :)
@_date: 2016-07-06 21:51:33
Then I think it's a smallish amount given your confidence in the 1day transfer, or you might be too optimistic.
@_date: 2016-07-11 15:02:12
How about Investing (as in money is in circulation helping people) 
Vs 
Saving ( under the mattress/ clod storage)
@_date: 2016-07-11 01:19:43
Haha, I sure don't want to be that guy.:)
But may be if he didn't spend it there would be no bitcoin outside of his nodes  now. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 15:12:40
Was really too lazy to click.
Going an extra mile for sake if a lazy person is just a noble deed
So thanks :D
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:22:35
Laptops are not for 24/7 use at 100%
Save your device 
@_date: 2016-07-11 08:09:20
What I think you point is: "sustainability vs. Growth"
But I think even sustainability will not happen with excessive holding.
If you have a cafe and calculate that it's better for you to close it and in a year time the gain in the BTC value that you will get after selling it is much better than running the business for the same year.
I don't think that is very sustainable.
@_date: 2016-07-11 07:45:21
Good one, I don't know, what are your thoughts?
@_date: 2016-07-11 07:57:56
I didn't really get your point,
But if I take the first part, you care about the market as it is the carrier of your fortune.
If you have all of the 21 MBTC do you think you will be very rich or will the BTC then be not relevant at all.
@_date: 2016-07-08 23:28:07
Not clear how to participate or what are the results so far.
@_date: 2016-07-11 19:18:19
Thanks, but it's already there in the post update 1.
Very interesting though .
@_date: 2016-07-10 12:54:45
I don't think so, seems they will have their own nodes .
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:52:08
How about the other extreme, if everyone hodled 100%
I think that is death too, it will not be a currency but maybe cryptoArtwork
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:48:01
It's cool, I'm still open for suggestions.
For me it's not closed yet, cat seem to grasp it 100% who would have thought that economics were that important:)-
@_date: 2016-07-14 16:19:35
December 2013
@_date: 2016-07-17 12:43:51
If so then there's no sense in using them in the first place.
@_date: 2016-07-08 23:29:17
We sure should be much higher indeed.
@_date: 2016-07-11 02:01:25
If the price goes x10 then you will be the judge of merchants declining was a bad thing or a good thing :)
Of course the counter argument is it will never reach x10 without being broadly accepted.
@_date: 2016-07-11 08:19:05
Only applicable if I was backed by the FED.
You need a money press to keep up with that��
@_date: 2016-07-14 16:18:19
10%over market price!
What does that spell out?
@_date: 2016-07-11 08:21:54
Because if I buy back it will be at a higher price, so I'm better off holding from the beginning.
@_date: 2016-07-11 08:16:50
Sounds reasonable.
If only they thought us better economics, I am not rally sure how far you can go just learning from Reddit��
@_date: 2016-07-09 13:42:55
Isn't market cap. NINE - Ten billion USD!?
based on 650$X 14MBTC
@_date: 2016-07-11 01:01:41
 but still what will help ether to grow?
@_date: 2016-07-15 00:24:15
Please be warned of their advertised guide / starter kits!
@_date: 2016-07-18 03:11:22
I just thought paper wallets could be the poor man's HW wallet.
BTW I already did step one on 
@_date: 2016-07-11 08:02:10
I think the analogy to stock is just wrong.
When you hold a stock you give the company liquidity to do more and grow.
As stock and money are not the same thing.
But when you hold BTC you are reducing it's own liquidity.
@_date: 2016-07-11 07:44:12
Sorry I didn't get how:
" this competition will erode the value and scare holders to liquidate " ?
What I understand that competition for it will drive the price up!
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:18:30
That last part looks like what I'm fearing, but  technical terms :
"" The apparent over-pricing of bitcoin from the perspective of people engaging in short term transactions will encourage the creation and adoption of competing systems""
@_date: 2016-07-10 23:55:32
You mean open the cashed page from Google results?
@_date: 2016-07-30 13:14:49
If you still have those I'm interested in buying. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:10:26
Wow that was sure useful.
Thanks :)
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:21:17
A year back they were mining at 200$/ BTC JUST FINE
