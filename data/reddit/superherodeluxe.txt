That would be nice but since I only have bitcoin and ethereum I can look down at monthly change and do a quick average of the two.  (You can change each coin to show 1 month 2 month etc in the blockfolio app)

In 1970, you could go to a top university and pay for it with a part time job.

I love how those commercials show people obsessing about looking and touching their gold like Gollum.

I attempted to use Gemini last night.  I couldn't get any of my banks set up with it because it kept indicating my login info wasn't valid.  BS.

Confirmation bias is a problem everywhere for everyone except for those who monitor for confirmation  bias and take steps to adjust for the effects of itself.  We all have cognitive biases and we need to watch and adjust for their effects.

NOT everyone.  Coinbase is big and popular and successful so it gets slammed very loudly just like any other large business does.

The opposite has historically happened when it comes to restrictions regarding the internet.

I recommend people watch  (money as debt).  It is very easy to follow and I can say understanding the system overall made it easy for me to out of debt and become wesltgy.

Coinbase fees aren't bad at all compared to the profits being made.  1.5% per per buy/sell is like pocket change.

I love arguing with people about bit coin during expensive dinners and lunches and being told it is a hoax and so on,..... Then I use my bit coin visa to pay for lunch often offering to pick up the whole tab.
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:10:45
Search Google for "bit pay visa reviews" and read up.

exactly, I cash out to a paypal-prepaid account and then transfer funds any way I want from there.  in this sort of situation I'll transfer money to an ACTUAL credit card and use THAT for an eBay transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:55:04
Yes, both. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:45:56
You would not have those issues if you had a bitcoin VISA.
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:07:14
Right.  If someone has a bitcoin today and it doubles in value 8 times, the person will have over a million dollars at that point.

Yes, and this is a big holiday weekend In the USA so we likely won't see much action from people here until tuesday.  
I already just did my new purchases and I've been holding since  and keep buying so it is all good. Anyway, the price now is fantastic, I was very glad to see it drop so much after

It never asked for mine.  It isn't curious at all.  What sorts of dodgy stuff have you been doing?

When I first set these up, very small transfers were made automatically and I had to verify the amounts that were transferred.  In order to do that I needed direct access to current account information.

What made you believe that they are not both rooted in a manifestation of the same phenomena?  A light may make things easier to see AND cause objects to heat up.  Why on earth assume the cause is two separate phenomena?
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:00:15
You don't understand modern science.

That doesn't explain what's causing the magnetism.  (Lol at the "too much to explain" part.  If no one here can understand, you are *baffling with bullshit*)
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:49:44
No, you're not listening to what we are saying.  The loan ends up in the banking system again so 90% OF THAT gets loaned out.  Lather, rinse, repeat.

I am in the USA.  I can withdraw or deposit using bank account numbers.  I can move money between bank accounts as well.
After all, it is the 21st century.
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:36:59
No, it is not that.  No one knows, there is just reference to a fundamental force, but no proven explanation of how that fundamental force is doing what it does.
@_date: 2018-04-17 17:36:26
Not initially, no.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:44:31
No, they loan out 90% and then do it again and again.

I'd prefer to communicate on an adult level.  If you are able to address the question, feel free to do it.

I remember the total world debt being explained in Forbes or some such a while back and it said the world debt was like 168 trillion.  My first thought was "debt to who, aliens?". 
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:46:06
What makes you believe that they are two separate phenomena?
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:00:31
The question is: is what causes them to happen different?  No one knows.  If you have a link to proof that demonstrates that what causes them is different, I'd love to see it, there will be some science awards you'll be winning if you can.
Also, no scientific experiment has ever proved that *minds* exist.  Not one.  Ever.  The world is.much more odd than you think.
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:23:54
It can't be done, no one knows how it all works.  Wikipedia uses circular reasoning.  Magnets make magnetic fields and magnetic fields make up magnets. 
Remember when you see young and in school and they had you spread iron filings so you could see THE magnetic field a magnet has?  They didn't have you do the experiment more than once because a different field happens each time you do the experiment.  That magnetic field they showed you is a lie.
 
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:42:55
They tricked you so you'd stop asking questions and realize that no one knows how magnets work (people know WHAT happens, but that doesn't explain what causes it).  Seriously, no one knows.
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:40:36
That doesn't explain what's causing the magnetism.  Again, no one knows.
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:08:02
No, it would rise by 90 dollars since banks can make loans with that 10 a bunch of times.
