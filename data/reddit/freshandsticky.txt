I quote the austrian economist julian simon "the only scarce resource is human time, because it's the resource to make more of everything". Now we have one more thing, that is also scarce like human time. Which we can not make more of no matter what, and that is bitcoin. Bitcoin is the first liquid asset whose supply is strictly scarce. What the significance of that is, when you understand that time is the thing is that's truly scarce to human beings. And money is an attempt to save our wealth across time, or specifficaly to preserve the fruits of our labor of today into the future.

If you understand bitcoin, you only hold bitcoin.

If it will work in the future, is a decentralised facebook/uber/airbnb interesting to you guys? No one that uses your data, everything will cost 30% less because there is no intermediat.

They can copy everything, but if the project would like it to stay anonymous they can use a blender like enigma.
@_date: 2018-08-27 15:23:51
That's on average what an intermediate in a sharing application like uber or airbnb takes. That's also what google takes on advertising. 
I'm not saying crypto would work, but it will work in the favor of the consumer if it works.

Probably, how they do not have ddos protection with such profits is beyond me. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 15:15:43
You said it right, the online wallets. You can always exchange bitcoins.

Bitcoin Price (USD)

One reason why there will never be a another bitcoin is because it was a complete fair game distribution wise, without any founding team that wanted to profit.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:58:46
Cheaper transactions would mean more transactions, which would mean bigger blocks that smaller miners cant keep up with.
@_date: 2019-06-30 10:53:13
I have no idea, its my main concern. I’m talking about future fees, they will be too expensive for the regular guy.
@_date: 2019-06-30 08:20:33
How will bitcoin solve expensive on and offramp to second layer?

The usd is not backed by gold either anymore, which means its backed even less.
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:53:39
I never understood why they're claiming it's not backed by anything. It's backed by computing power, which costs money.
@_date: 2019-05-26 10:02:42
It's backed by computing power which has value.
@_date: 2013-12-02 07:17:28
Awesome, it's creeping me out. And that's a good thing.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:23:15
It could go down to 500, it could go up to 1200 again. Probably worth it in the long run. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:57:25
fuck yea

Every project today is started for profit, the chances of there being another one are small.

I'd love to, where should I start? I've been trying to get into it lately, not sure what your comment is about. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:47:56
I'll send you a reminder next week. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:24:12
Please sell all your bitcoins and cry later. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:53:30
I did not think of that at all, it would suck if some major party released their own crypto.

Do a chargeback with paypal, 99% sure you'd win.

How do you know that is the fbi wallet?

I won't leave my house for a week, don't want that conversation with people. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:41:38
You sure can, but you will use the same one as pretty much thousands of other people. 
I think you can survive on hotdogs and gatorade, does that mean you should?

How do I add myself?
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:15:47
I will, thanks. Know any other good places, not on reddit maybe?
@_date: 2013-10-24 14:28:20
They'll probably freeze your account.

Stop being a hater, do you think successful people are haters? they aint got no time for that.

Sorry, but getting 2 clients from 1 post is just too profitable to not try it again :)
@_date: 2013-12-09 13:19:06
This crash did not bother me that much, had that "oh well" feeling. But was already playing with merely profits.
