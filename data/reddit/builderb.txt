Right, that's my point... if you trade stocks or something there's a record. With Bitcoin, potentially there is no way to know. I have no idea how the IRS can try taxing people. Supposedly you're supposed to pay taxes on any gains you make with Bitcoin (same as everything else), but there's no way for them to know.

So basically if you mined a bunch of bitcoins early on, then bought a bunch of stuff from TigerDirect, the IRS has no idea if you don't pay any taxes on your "profits"

Yes, obviously because people with Japanese heritage are incapable of learning how to read/write English to the same level as "native" speakers. And because one Japanese man is not capable of having such a wide range of skill sets. It must be someone else, probably a white guy in Europe or America using a pseudonym.  /s

I think the difference between the dollar and bitcoin is that the dollar is backed by the US Government. The US Government is backed by people with guns and tanks and missiles and jets and aircraft carriers and submarines and satellites etc.

This guy is way too good-looking to be trusted. (Warren Harding effect?)

Bitcoin itself won't have any problem with this but if you're looking for widespread adoption, this can become a major issue. Governments can't tax bitcoin transactions. They will make it illegal for stores to accept bitcoin... then bitcoin will not thrive beyond underground exchanges.
