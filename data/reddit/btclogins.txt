This is not even close to similar to any other services. Our system is 100% automated, which means that the client reveives his/her item within a matter of seconds after the payment is confirmed.  
We have 10's of satisfied customers, read around to see that our reputation is very good.

Of course we're able to match that!
We have now lowered out price to 9.99€

This site hasn't beem promoted through reddit, but via other forums such as flashback, bitcointalk, and link-engines.
When we posted this for the first time on here we got 8 ups here on reddit as well.

I'm guessing that would have showed up by now, we have already been in business for a month.
Besides, when we first started we had +10 in supporters here on reddit, until you started accusing us of being untrustworthy.  
You would only have that right to accuse us if you we're unrespectfully treated by us which you haven't been since you haven't purchased something from us.
I checked your history and you seem to be pissed off on everybody here on reddit since you got scammed on some random site for a few bucks.  How could that in any way be our fault ?

It's not easy making it in this industry, especially when people think we're untrustworthy due to bad experiences with other unserious businesses.
We're doing our best to improve our service. Please feel free to leave suggestions on how you think we could do things better.
We have for eg. updated our whois record with new info.

Feel free to try us out.
We're aiming to thrive in a longer perspective.
Besides if we're untrustworthy, wouldn't that show up pretty quick on our rep?
