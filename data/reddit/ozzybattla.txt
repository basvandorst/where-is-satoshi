and any other option either failed even harder or has no track record at all because it simply doesn't work to sustain an economy. There is a reason why there is no currency backed by gold any more... it wouldnt simply wouldnt be as competetive to other models.
      How did gold backed currency fail harder/have no track record? It was sustaining the US economy until Nixon forcefully removed it in '71, paving the way for endless money printing, explosion in national debt, and manipulation of interest rates by the Fed.

"guess what? governments fail over and over again and did so before people even knew fiat"
Of course govts fail over and over again, bureaucrats and politicians tend to often be comprised of inept or corruptible people (hence another reason that their power over the control of a state's economy should be ideally restricted). I'm referring to Fiat monetary policy failing historically many times in different contexts, which is a fact.
"governments spending more money than they have is nothing new and has not that much to do with fiat money. If the US gov. would cut expenses they surely would be able to pay back all the debt very quickly."
Yes, governments love to spend money that they don't have - and the creation or printing of fiat dollars aids this process, as money is no longer inherently tied to anything of intrinsic value (so it is easier to over-inflate, and is less resemblant of the actual wealth of a society, than a money backed by gold for example), but rather issued at a whim by totally-honest and benevolent central bankers in collusion with governments. 
As for paying the debt back, plus the ever-growing interest it's accruing , ill hold my breath, the national debt doubled under Obama's 8 years in office alone (so in 8 years as much debt was accrued as the 230-odd years of the USA existing beforehand). The debt's growing exponentially. A Fiat system since '71 and policies of leftism , as well as neocons funding the military industrial complex and starting wars all over the damn place, have all contributed to this massive debt problem. The US State can't just cut their expenses, unless they are to drastically reduce their own power (plus the quality of life that the citizenry are now accustomed to, with like 50% of Americans being recipients of some form of state aid or welfare). Statists will pay back the debt and in doing so willingly relinquish vast amounts of their power? And would allow other nations such as China to usurp them geopolitically in the process? No, again I'll hold my breath, they will continue this Fiat game until it meets it's inevitable fate and ends badly. Give central banks and statists the power to print money out of thin air, it doesn't end well,

you literally did that your self by attacking colleges and trying to refute my argument by just saying that they are all leftist SJWs...
      The difference is what leftist SJWs say about 58+ genders can be shown objectively or biologically to be wrong, whereas zerohedge pointing out the historical failures of various fiat currencies is actually measurable and quantifiably true. 
A Wikipedia article? You may as well link to infowars ��.  But gold - based currencies existed for Millenia, the roman's denarius was based on silver I believe, and that served as a sound monetary system until as you pointed out, the US couldn't keep up with trade deficits and wanted to print more money. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 02:46:30
idk, because the 58 gender thing is not an issue in Europe. 
    You don't know that it can objectively and biologically be proven to be wrong? Take a look at human anatomy. Unless you're one of those people who believe in social constructivism, gender isn't same as sex etc. 
it's not a proper source. period. If you would have really visited a college you would know that a political motivated partisan blog with anonymous authors is not something you can bring as a source.
      Oh well I guess I must not have really visited college then, the masters degree I have from literally the best college in my country and one of the best in the world must be a fraud. 
 I just sent you the first link on google when I searched "failure of fiat currencies", I will concede I'm a bit too lazy to go and find peer reviewed theses for you to dissect, because I have other things to do, but theres many better-quality and better sourced articles out there on the subject, if you're interested to learn more about it. 
I would argue in this instance that given the historical evidence of various fiat monetary regimes collapsing, the political leanings or anonymity of Zerohedge as a source is rather irrelevant, as what the source was arguing is still empirically true - or would you argue that fiat hasn't failed on various occasions in different historical and cultural contexts, over and over again?
The US is over 20 trillion in debt at this point, they can't pay it back short of inflating the currency to print a $20 trillion bill. This increase in debt and correlating growth of the power and influence of the state apparatus is largely related to Fiat monetary policy.

"weekly bitcoin trading volume through one popular website has soared from about $US225,000 earlier this year to nearly $US2.1 million in the first week of December"
2.1 million trading volume.... thats like nothing lol
       Okay, well that doesn't refute the point that proportionate to many or even most other countries, Venezuelans have been/are using Bitcoin and other crypto at a high rate, largely due to preferring it over their own worthless native currency. Zimbabweans and other African populations are also using Bitcoin for similar reasons (hyperinflation of their native currencies) 
"yeah, sure lol. Every proper professor would let you fail the class if you argue with pseudoscience aka Asturian economics."
        Just like every proper professor these days says that there's 58+ genders; because contemporary Western academia is flooded with leftist postmodern ideals which don't accurately reflect the real world. 
"why do you put so much energy keeping the echo chamber going? i know the answer... do you?"
         Okay so don't answer my question as to why you're expending time and energy here, if you believe Bitcoin is a bubble/scam/prone to be shut down by govts. I'm here because I think Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology and because I prefer it to Fiat currency, which doesn't have a great track record:

"A central bank lends money to banks and these can buy US-bonds for the market price. There is a reason why a central bank is "private" and isn't allowed to directly lend money to a government or can be directly controlled by a government."
You don't see any fundamental issues with Fiat monetary policy as opposed to having a gold based monetary system, or a system of money that is tied to assets of intrinsic value? Fiat, apart from being implemented sporadically historically, is a relatively new phenomena, for the majority of human civilisation we've associated our money with assets such as gold, importantly being due to the scarcity and (perceived) inherent/universal value of such assets. Now we've handed over control of our monetary management and supply to a cabal of elitists and bureaucrats, who are more than capable of making human error which can have highly negative consequences for our society. 
"the debt to gdp ratio doesn't grow exponentially" 
Yes well it would have been interesting in '08 hadn't the State bailed out the corporate criminals, and actually let events play out on a natural or even moral basis. Let alone policies such as quantitative easing, artificially injecting the economy with helicopter money. Temporary bandaid solutions for a much larger underlying wound. 
"yes, i agree. Wars are expensive."
And immoral. Perhaps without fake fiat dollars the West would be more hesitant to constantly poke the hornets nest in the Middle East, stirring up tensions before deciding it's a great idea to let millions of third worlders from often extremely divergent cultures come and settle in western nations, often on the public purse? Again, not the fault of the average man, it's the fault of govts, aided and abetted by an endless supply of sweet Fiat to keep the machine running. 
"so the debt gave the US the dominating role in the world? sounds like a good investment."
I wouldn't say the debt made US the most powerful State, Europe had already crippled itself as with China and Japan during WW2 through massacring the shit outta each other, America was much less harmed, aside from their immediate costs associated with their late entry to the war, they didn't have too much debt and went on to boom in the late 40s and 50s largely through ingenuity, production and a strong work ethic. They've since gone heavily into debt with the increase in the size of their state and state programs, welfare, proxy wars and economic mismanagement (all empires rise and fall after all). So I don't expect the elite or Statists in America to willingly or altruistically reduce the size of the state apparatus (which costs trillions to run, with all the McGubbment workers and programs) in order to pay their debts, because that would reduce their own power, and result in many angry and desperate citizens (the Free Shit Army is accustomed to receiving milk from the government teat now, and if [note: when] it ever runs dry, it won't be pretty). 
"bitcoin will sooner or later find its end as well... like everything else."
I guess we shall see what happens. It may not end up being Bitcoin, something may replace it in future, but I view a decentralised peer to peer currency as being both an enormous technological advancement as well as a good hedge, amongst other assets, to safeguard (and as it's shown in many cases, to even exponentially increase) one's personal wealth.

A two second google search yields multiple articles about bitcoin's popularity in Venezuela, here's one:
For a lot of them it's not about gambling or speculative investment, it's about Bitcoin (despite its volatility) being a better place for them to store value than their constantly hyper inflating fiat currency run by a socialist government. Zimbabwe is banning banks from Bitcoin dealings for a similar reason, as people naturally don't want to store their value under the Zimbabwean dollar, despite the 'benevolence' of their government and central banks. 
I did happen to take economics in college, and somehow graduated without becoming a Keynesian or an SJW.
Just curious, given your stance on Bitcoin, why you are expending time and energy on this subreddit? Respectfully asking, as you're entitled to your views, as much as I personally disagree with them. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 23:56:42
I tend to agree , excluding the possibility that negative press / exchange hack etc happens to occur which would cause short term FUD. But hey I wouldn't be opposed to buying some more at those levels!

Well Bitcoin is legal tender is Japan and hugely popular in Korea so I don't expect those countries to promptly do a 180 anytime soon, particularly when it nets their governments large amounts of tax revenue. If a govt bans Bitcoin , other govts. will gladly take the capital outflows. 
Also not sure that Russia wants to ban crypto as Putin is fond of Ethereum. China also is interested in blockchain and crypto they just don't like the decentralised aspect of it (because they like controlling everything), but again, they currently produce more Bitcoin than any other country, they would be stupid to ban it, rather than heavily taxing their miners.
And proportionately, relative to its population, Venezuelan demand is not tiny at all. 
But hey, if you're concerned and believe that central banks and governments can just spontaneously destroy Bitcoin or halt mining operations, perhaps investing in Bitcoin isn't for you. You can stick to Fiat currency, which depreciates about 3% every single year and which is doomed to failure.

Again, Bitcoin operates on an international and decentralised playing field. When you state that "they" would need to go after exchanges, who is "they"? The Greeks, chinese, Congolese? Unlikely that all 190-something different nation states would agree. In fact States which have tried to regulate or criminalise Bitcoin the most such as Venezuela are actually where some of the highest demand for Bitcoin is... not to mention growing availability of decentralised exchanges.

Bitcoin is dying? Ha. Fiat is dying a slow and painful death, the collapse of the Fiat dollar is inevitable. Why did you get into crypto? If you came only for 'moon' and 'lambos' you may not see the bigger picture. In the end, when it all comes crashing down, whether it's BTC, real estate, or precious metals, it's good to own and hold items with a use case and of scarcity, instead of toilet paper fiat dollars mass-printed at a whim to fund false government promises and a warfare/welfare machine. The future of Bitcoin is still open and is up to all of us. The future of fiat is predestined, and it does not end well.
