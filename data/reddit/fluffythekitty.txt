More like Every Country on Earth.
If you owe money to the government, in *any* country, you've got 2 basic options:
1) Pay it/declare bankruptcy/serve some years in jail/settle your debt some other way
2) Leave the country and never return. This option isn't legal, but it's still an option. Roger chose this route. He can't say "pause!" and visit for a week - that's the price he paid in exchange for not paying his taxes.

Yeah, I'm *sure* he's the reason.
Mind trying to explain the logic behind that?

So, you're both shills, and we're supposed to prefer one over the other?

Okay, thanks for your time. One last question:
Are you allowed to lie about your location in international payment methods? If I say I'm located in the US, and set the MG/WU receiver country somewhere else, is it allowed/will anyone notice/will anyone care?

It actually *is* how IQs work.

Ah, thanks. Also, can you filter localbitcoins.com deals by payment method?
EDIT: Found it.

Alright, thanks. What I'm looking for is just mostly an anonymous payout - if the prepaid credit cards are anonymous, no problem. However, credit cards being the way they are, I doubt it.
