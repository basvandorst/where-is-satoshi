Give me a break. How many businesses are really "transparent"? So called transparency is mostly a facade in most cases. 
In the real world most businesses aren't and play the cards very close to the chest. 
Very often it's not in the best interest of shareholders or in the best interest the company to be transparent. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:03:29
It's amazing that after this open communication you come forward with such bullshit. 
Anyone surprised Danny was advised to cut contact with people from Cyprus following those threats? 
The one mistake Danny made was hiring someone like you who ends his post with "where the fuck is our money". By that you mean 1 month unpaid wages? Some people work 6 months on end without getting paid, you freaking clown. 
You also make a lot of assumptions about "threats" being fabricated without having any evidence of them being "fabricated". 
You just run your foul mouth instead trying to help transition to new ownership.

Neo has a beta stage software for a bitcoin pos payment network. I believe they've even released some bitcoin debit cards and pos devices. Lots of interested merchants. Brand awareness is also there. Yes, there was late negative coverage but that was under reported compared to the initial aggressive media campaign that was even featured during high profile football games on TV. All this could be easily revived once new investor steps in. People could get their jobs back, new positive spin in the media and operations can be resumed.

Both parties are entitled to terminate the agreement just like in a marriage. You can't force love to happen because it would turn into rape.

There are now clear laws in place that require regulatory compliance. MPEx took money from US investors and is not compliant and wasn't compliant. Suffice to say several crypto stock exchanges were forced to shut down in US after receiving letters from regulators. 
I don't buy that Hollywood scenario you've described but he will be taken to US most likely, but in a polite way on a passenger plane in handcuffs.

Danny did his best to try and cover for the Bitfunder fiasco which was not his doing with his own money.

Check my reply to the other comment. 
I think an involvement by someone of his calibre would be very beneficial. A slime like Andreeseen got involved and no one seemed to mind. I like Carl much more because he calls it as he sees it and he's honest stand up guy. Even if you don't like some of his corporate raiding ways, which have lots of merit btw, he can still bring plenty of other investors on-onboard and positive attention to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:21:29
Employees can easily be rehired especially in Cyprus where there is no shortage of work force. If anything them quitting reduces Neo's debt obligations which is a positive. 
There is plenty of brand awareness and that's what matters. A few random sporadic articles here and there didn't go far in terms of coverage.
2-3 people who Danny individually dealt with is something else. Criminal charges part is all BS and won't go anywhere after quick brief settlement. 
1-2mil debt is peanuts. Can easily be gobbled up by a new owner.

Never invest more than you afford to lose, sure. 
I wouldn't call it dead though until the fat lady sings. Even Tuur said in his statement VCs were checking out Neo early April. 
Danny is the active type that will try and find a solution. I have solid reasons to believe he's no thief or crook. 
I will give this few more months to watch this unfold. Final outcome might surprise people.

 or the decentralized options 
@_date: 2014-05-09 15:06:45










There are two sides to every story. Clearly Danny doesn't appreciate the situation he finds himself in. I don't think what happened was intentional or premeditated on his part. I think a series of factors concurred in what lead to this point: Bitfunder's shutdown where Neo lost a fat chunk of IPO funds, Bitcoin price, Gox failure, alarmist fud (most of it untrue at the time coming from MPEx, like Danny's name being fake and other off the charts BS), panicky reactions from employees and so on. Employees themselves urged Danny to resign in what was probably a very heated discussion. You don't ask your boss something like that as en employee no matter how badly business is doing. Lots of people failed to keep a cool head and resolve this situation in peaceful manner. Unfortunately some high profile respected community heroes like Antonopolous urged employees to go public with the situation very early on, going against common sense and the plan of finding an investor to solve the liquidity issue.
Danny certainly made a fat chunk of bad decisions but I think it's safe to say he was under a lot of pressure himself. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 12:44:34
It's a disgusting display of disinformation driven by MPEx shills unfortunately. Others who sold out taking a loss are joining the bandwagon of haters. Most of the crap posted in the OP lacks critical information. 
There's no mention of the fact amount of funds lost in the Bitfunder IPO and exchange who died out due to US gov SEC investigation.

This is a simplistic view. Very often he fought to create value for shareholders and most importantly to push away poor CEOs and entitled greedy management that mismanaged companies only to enrich themselves unfairly. 
Something worth reading on the topic 
Some highlights:
Icahn has called CEOs the survivors of the corporate world, but says it's the "survival of the unfittest": "[The CEO] would never have anyone underneath him as his assistant that's brighter than he is because that might constitute a threat. So therefore, with many exceptions, we have CEO's becoming dumber and dumber and dumber." 
"The person who moves up the ladder to CEO, Icahn told Stossel, is more of a politician than a manager. "
""He doesn't make waves, because if you make waves they throw you out." 
" When asked if he objected to successful CEOs being paid high salaries, Icahn said "absolutely not."
"Let him make his money if the shareholders are making the money," Icahn said. "But don't pay him these huge bonuses, these huge severances."
Executives should be fairly compensated, Icahn said. "It's insane to pay somebody 700 times what the average worker gets." 
"Icahn believes the current financial crisis will not be helped if President-elect Barack Obama continues to pump money into the economy when he takes office. "That's not the answer. It's a short-term fix. It's like somebody dying and you give them a little morphine." 
"Unless you change the system," Icahn told Stossel, "we will not be able to compete in the future, one, and we're going to keep having the exact headaches we're having today." 
 "Some people say, you're the bad guy," said Stossel. "You corporate raiders, you go in, you save money, but you save money by firing workers."
"That's ridiculous, because if you look at the companies that I've taken over, I keep putting money into them," Icahn replied. "We put in hundreds of millions of dollars. Almost every company that I have, I've put in a lot of money, but I don't fritter that money away."
"I could go into a company and I'll tell you I can save 30 percent of costs, not just by firing employees. But just by [eliminating] wasted investments."
"It's not doing the world any good… having five people or four people doing the job that one person should be doing. At the end, that person's going to lose his job anyway." 
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:17:15
Some many clueless people here posting crap. 
Let me make something perfectly clear for you. 
Danny left Cyprus to raise money by selling a hefty chunk of his shares. This move was required to solve the liquidity issue.
It was good move to go to London since that's the place to be if you want do raise cash and find investors. Investors won't find themselves had Danny decided to sit on his ass and pamper his 1 month unpaid employees back in Cyprus. Get it? 
MtGox collapse screwed up things by shortening the time Danny had to find potential new investors. Danny wasn't hoping to "save" the company with those funds. Read his previous Bitcointalk statement. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 00:25:50

I'm not saying that. I'm saying this incident could have been easily resolved had Danny found a buyer before airing all the dirty laundry to the press and general public. 
That would have required a certain level of secrecy to not spill the beans at such critical moment. 
Danny made a mistake telling employees they were insolvent before actually trying to find investors or creditors. As soon as employees found out about liquidity issue, news leaked out to the community and death threats were made Someone didn't keep his mouth shut. It was all downhill from there.

At least half of your claims here are false. 
For example:
Daughter threats - Those were made while he was in the UK. We can only speculate but she could be in safe hands in Cyprus. I'm not aware of the specifics of the situation and neither are you. 
Reported threats - Danny never said those threats were reported to Cypriotic police. He said they were reported to "relevant authorities". Danny doesn't even speak Greek. Relevant authorities could be UK authorities.

No need for insults. 
Product was pretty real and tangible: the Neo Bee debit cards, POS processors, the early stage beta software and so on. It wasn't enough time for whole thing to be properly launched and deployed.
Lack of governmental regulation was never an issue. If anything regulators helped destroy this business being by all indications behind the Bitfunder exchange shutdown, which took place just 1 month after btct.co and litecoinglobal were forced to shut down by SEC. One of the main reasons Neo faced liquidity issues was because of this. IPO funds got frozen in Bitfunder shutdown. There are successful startups that have launched via such exchanges
There was no need for "physical shares". Everyone knew they weren't buying physical shares. They were more like corporate bonds in a sense. That wasn't an issue really as no one was seeking to gain board seats or do some hostile takeover.

Liberty reserve operators were arrested in Spain (EU) and Costa Rica and extradited to the US to face charges, so yeah law pretty much applies. MPEx operator did take value from US investors in form of Bitcoin, which are now considered a commodity in the US (just like diamonds or gold). The sale of Satoshi Dice happened on MPEx and US regulators are very much interested in all the details surrounding that and in the exchange itself who operated without a license, helping US investors to launder money and dodging taxes, not having KYC and AML compliance in place.

I didn't "lose" anything because I don't invest for short term and to be swayed by trolls and paid shills. I used this chance to buy more.

Lies and disinformation coming from MPEx.

Did I say that? 
MPEx trolls were fighting to destroy competition for quite some time and managed to successfully aggravate a problem that could have been resolved without all this fuss. 
MPEx did manage to make some people panic which lead to those threats which lead to further complications like the arrest warrant.
Neo faced a liquidity issue (partially due to no fault of Danny like the Bitfunder closer and even the MtGox shutdown). I'm not saying Danny couldn't have managed the funds bit more carefully. Overspending on ads was probably also part of causing the liquidity issue.

Lol. Do I need to brag about who follows me on twitter? Does that make you honest? I'm followed by Roger Ver and David Morgan, Doug Wead, Peter Schiff. Did I win this pissing contest?

Neo is in a great position and will get funding. There are plenty of VCs ready to throw money at all things Bitcoin. Neo is one of the best start-ups in an advanced stage. MPEx psychopathic trolls are in for a big surprise. Two surprises actually when you also account for MP's upcoming arrest and extradition.

What makes you think he doesn't own Bitcoin already? Would be bad for his business at this point to publicly admit it since he's a gold resellers and even offers gold pegged accounts with debit cards. He's pretty heavily invested in gold businesses and openly accepting that Bitcoin is gold 2.0 would be kinda` tough thing for him to do, even though it would be the right thing.

You are clearly an ignorant child judging by the juvenile way of posting. All the smiley faces and retarded glee are also good indicator of that.

Mircea Popescu known as MP, the person behind MPEx exchange is running a defamation campaign using dozen of reddit and bitcointalk accounts. Don't listen to his garbage. He should be more worried about his upcoming extradition rather than bashing competition being the sour loser that he is, who just can't admit MPEx is dead and buried operation.

Do I sense a bit of edginess there?

A bit too heavy on the theatrics MPEx. Take it down a notch.

Not really. Satoshi Dice was an IPO. There's a big difference.
