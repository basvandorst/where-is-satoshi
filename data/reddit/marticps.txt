I know the reality, but I am a grandiloquent pseudopriest who whants to spread some moral lessons about what to do. Also, I think we have to teach about decentralized currencies.

And why not to add a captcha for human verification?
I tried not to repeat comments from the other question. Hope I helped

+1, you should add something to prove that you are trustful. Not just a mail.

You cannot especulate. Use bitcoin for what it is designed. If you use them to invest like in Wall Street we will fail together.

And the fees would raise a lot... Anybody has calulated them? Maybe you'll end up with a 10-15% of loses...

There are 3 persons involved:
- Subject A buys with PayPal some object from eBay and receives BTC.
- Subject B sells some object from eBay and Receives PayPal.
- Subject C sells some BTC and receives an object from eBay.

1) The transfer is not immediate, you have to wait the miners to confirm it. First confirmation may last ~10 minutes.
2) Not necessary, but for little transactions they will ask a comission. If you do a transaction of 1BTC you can be almost sure that they will confirm the transaction without any comission.
3) Edit: Vibr8gKiwi explained it very well.

These comissions are stablished by the protocol. If there was no comission, a hacker should be able to send millions of transactions, saturate the net and collapse the system.

It looks good. The logo does not redirect to the homepage.
Maybe you should put an About section.
The slogan is in NL so I don't understand anything XD.
There are a lot of HTML errors, you can see them here:

I know, and I don't like PayPal. But using this method if the buyer wants to SCAM he will have to deal with the product seller and eBay, not with the BTC seller, since he received his product at home. In this method the seller is the one who is protected, because he has not to release the money until he receives his object.
