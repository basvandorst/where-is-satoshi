Can this be used (eventually) in Australia?

Headline is not my own, but from the upstream source. Even so, I fail to see how it's manipulative or sensationalised, it's concise, factual and to the point.
All things considered while this is a genuine flaw (in OpenSSL, not Bitcoin itself) it's a pretty minor one, due to the required level of a access.

Yes, but regardless of how you do escrow (Counterparty or standard Bitcoin transactions), you'd need a human mediator. Said mediator would not be able to abscond with the funds however.

Sorry, allow me to clarify:
Both Counterparty and standard multisignature Bitcoin transactions let you have escrow where the funds are held without a third party. In the case of Bitcoin, these are n-of-m wallets. For example's sake, a 2 of 3 wallet, requiring signatures from the 2 of private keys corresponding to the public keys included in the transaction script. The three keys are, in this example, buyer, seller, and mediator. At no point can the mediator run off with the funds. The use case is quite simple, depending on the trade outcome:
* All goes well - buyer and seller sign to release the funds to the seller
* There's a dispute, but buyer and seller come to an agreement - buyer and seller sign to return funds to buyer.
* There's a dispute an an agreement cannot be reached. Mediator investigates. If the mediator determines the buyer was in the right, mediator and buyer sign to return funds to buyer. If the mediator determines the seller was in the right, mediator and seller sign to release funds to the seller.
Please note that I said "mediator". They do not hold the funds, this is not their responsibility. Their responsibility is investigating in the event of a dispute and determining who is in the right.
In either system, if there is a dispute, you're going to need a human to investigate and choose who the funds should go to.
To be clear, if we're talking about atomic trades between cryptoassets within Counterparty, then of course, a mediator is not needed (as the trade is atomic). I am talking about the usecase of buying off-chain goods (whether physical or digital) with cryptocurrencies.

Not really. I hold a small amount of coins and intend to hold them long term. The discussed flaw is a legitimate and people should be aware of it, butbut it can be avoided simply by not reusing addresses. Even then, this is only possible due to a bug on OpenSSL, not Bitcoin itself. Furthermore, this attack would require local access anyway.

Oh, of course :) I'm no detractor. I truly think Counterparty is an amazing protocol with so many uses beyond what can be accomplished in vanilla Bitcoin transactions.
My purpose in posting was simply to point out that trustless escrow can be done without the complexity of Counterparty. I'm fully aware that there are many more advanced use cases that do require an overlay protocol such as Counterparty.
@_date: 2014-06-24 12:48:02
Nothing against Counterparty, as it does indeed suppor a whole load of complex things you can't do with vanilla bitcoin transactions, but you **can** in fact do escrow with plain old multisignature Bitcoin transactions. [Wiki link](

There's on going discussion about including a signature in the QR code so the person paying can verify it's a legitimate address.

What you're missing is that it's not a matter of choice. They do not have the legal right to wait until they see fit to release source, it is a legal **obligation** as consequence of creating a derived work from GPL-licensed code.
If you distribute a binary containing modified GPL-licensed code, and do not have a separate licensing agreement with whomever holds the copyright (I.e. with Telegram, in this case), then you are bound by the terms of the GPL, and hence you **must** license the resulting derivative work under the GPL **and** distribute the source code either with the binaries, or make it publicly available somewhere. Failure to do this is a violation of the license terms, meaning the license is forfeit until such a time as the terms are satisfied, hence the licensee (Getgems) are not authorised to re-use the GPL-licensed code from Telegram - it's not only a dick move, but also copyright infringement.
Relevant sections of the GPL:








































With this in mind, if (and **only if**) they had not yet distributed the resulting derived work (I.e. only tested it internally and not made available to anyone outside their organisation), then the distribution clause would not have been triggered. As the derived work _has_ been made public (It's on the Play store), then the derived work has clearly been distributed, which mandates the release of source code &amp; licensing of the derived work under the GPL.

I'd be interested in seeing what you have in mind. Sent a request to join the group you linked.

I could be wrong, but now that Ripple is FOSS, couldn't anyone run a node, leading to greater decentralisation?
@_date: 2013-11-14 11:03:30
This is exactly me :( Stuck working, always so drained at the end of the day I never have time to work on my personal code projects anymore, so much I want to learn and do, yet I never have the time or energy. No debt, but living hand-to-mouth isn't much better. I had a huge wallet back in 2009 and didn't think Bitcoin would go anywhere and never bothered to keep that disk, let alone the wallet around. It just seems that I could actually be doing something good for the world, if not for the perpetual wage slavery :(

Valid points, I don't really have any rebuttal regarding your first paragraph. Truth be told, I've a tendency to focus purely on the technical issues (I'm a programmer by trade) rather than the social / 'human' issues.
Second paragraph; I agree that the amount of data people willingly part with is worrying, not just on sites like SR, but also the seemingly benign (to the average layman, for whom integrity of personal data takes a back seat to convenience and "teh shiny") such as Facebook. That said, in the case of black markets, providing best practices (e.g. Always using GPG, non-identifiable pseudonyms, etc) are followed, there's very little chance of an individual's identity being discovered via technical means. Of course, there's still vulnurabilities beyond a user's control, such as a seller keeping address records (even if encrypted, there's always the risk of legal coercion), or a package being intercepted.

Litecoin is still proof-of-work based. There is no reason, other than lack of motivation, that a scrypt ASIC couldn't be produced.

The Bitcoin protocol actually has the functionality required to build escrow right into the block chain. Someone just needs to write a UI to build these transactions. 
Basically, you can have a transaction where it needs two of three signatures to spend it, the three being the buyer, the seller, and a trusted third party (Marketplace sites or services specific for mediation could arise, to which the transaction _could_ automatically include a fee to them.). When someone buys something, the buyer creates and signs a special transaction, including a script and the correct total inputs.
They broadcast this with a locktime in the future, so it hangs around (but doesn't get included in the blockchain) and a sequence number lower than the maximum (so that it can be revised). This proves that the buyer has the funds, and prevents them from otherwise spending them.
If it all goes well, the seller adds the output to an address under it's control and signs the transaction, broadcasting it again for the buyer to sign the output and release the coins.
If there's a dispute, and the seller agrees to refund the buyer without mediation, then they can generate an output refunding the buyer, signed by buyer and seller.
If there's a dispute, and mediation is required, the mediator and either one of the buyer or seller can sign the transaction and either release or refund the coins, depending upon the resolution.
The script operations are flexible enough to also allow a default resolution after some time period if there's no intervention (i.e. an auto-finalize feature like most darknet markets have, or automatic refund if not signed and released by the timeout).
Edit: I accidentally the word "address" in paragraph 4.

It's possible, with custom constructed transactions, to implement escrow / dispute resolution [in the blockchain itself]( Essentially, you can create a transaction that requires 2 of 3 signatures to spend its outputs. The buyer and seller simply agree upon some trusted mediator (who never actually holds the coins, nor has the ability to spend them, nor necesarily needs to even know the specifics of the product/service being sold).
So, if all goes well, the buyer and seller sign the transaction and the seller goes on his merry way with the coins. If there's a dispute, the mediator and either the buyer/seller (depending upon who the outcome of the dispute resolution process is in favour of) sign the transaction, releasing the coins to the appropriate party.
All that's needed is for someone to incorporate this functionality into a client (or into a hypothetical marketplace site itself). The remaining functionality required is simply a messaging system, feedback/reputation system, and some way of actually listing items, all three of which are (in my opinion) relatively easily solved.
Bitmessage could be a good starting point for the former two, as it supports both private messages between two peers, as well as publically readable messages, which could be used for feedback/ratings, incorporating GPG signatures if necessary). Just some food for thought...

Proof of Stake seems like it has potential (particularly in that you don't need to expend anywhere near as much energy to verify transactions), however the only PoS coin that I know of (ppcoin/peercoin) still uses traditional PoW for bootstrapping until all the coins have been created, so there really hasn't been a proper test of PoS so far, as I understand it.
