With all respect, what have you been smoking?
Nxt reached decentralized consensus, it doesn't use centralizred checkpoints.
Prove your claim please.

Afaik Nxt doesn't use checkpoints. Please give an example of a successful history attack. I've never seen any.

Please tell me specifically how dgex would do that. Saying "they can produce a chain with their stake in it" is easy to say, but how would it work in practice? How would they make it so that the majority of all nodes would think it was the legit chain? How would they overcome the rule that after 720 blocks the chain is frozen?
And your following statement is very far off, please check the facts next time: "Currently around 80 million coins are used to produce the longest chain for nxt."
(hint: the account 4747512364439223888 alone has 50M forging stake, and he isn't the only one forging)

RWMC will be used for picking which tips (unconfirmed tx) to validate and extend.
It has to be random in order to ensure that all branches of the tangle grow nicely and don't collapse into a single chain.

Gladly IOTA does use PoW. Yes even for token distribution. You had to do some PoW when claiming your tokens.


Depends on the legislature of your country. Iotas were legally sold as software tokens. There is also a legally established IOTA Foundation in Germany.
@_date: 2017-02-21 13:28:09
And attacking the Tangle is somewhat tricky, as mentioned in chapter 4 here:

There is certainly valid criticism for IOTA, but this is just trolling. The guys at canonical aren't dumb.

pos.pdf is a paper without hard facts: No math, no real world examples of how PoS could be insecure (throwing the word N around does not make it true), no specifics.
But some "it intuitively feels wrong" bullshit.
Just a paper by some PoW fanboy, get over it.
@_date: 2017-02-21 13:21:58
That's only true in a low load, small network with very low tps. (= low global hashrate). IOTA uses a centralized coordinator node until the netwok is mature enough to prevent such attacks. Probably until this summer.
Every newly launched PoW blockchain has this attack vector until the hashrate is big enough.
@_date: 2017-02-21 13:11:15


Remember, in Blockchains PoW is incentivized via fees, so the miners do it. But fees and microtransactions don't work well together. That's why In IOTA it's incentivized by being able to use the network, everyone who want's to attach their tx to the Tangle has to do PoW. so it's the users that do it.

You're talking to bitcoin maximalists here, I'm afraid they won't listen.
@_date: 2015-04-01 10:59:14


No. If all the worlds internet would go magically down, and I would be the only one left during one hour, my node would go on and produce blocks. Then, when all nodes reconnect, they would compare their chain with mine. In our example, let's say that my chain would be the "best". All other peers would add the blocks that I generated to their chain.
@_date: 2015-04-13 08:00:17


On average a miner with 51% always generates more blocks than the rest of the network. I don't deny that some (but not extraordinary much) luck is needed if he wanted to outpace the rest of the network during a pre-defined window of 6 blocks.


Yes, we agree on this. In the long run, where variance averages out, global hashrate is accurate, but NOT for a window of 6 blocks, where variance is large.


That only counts if the attacker would want to spend the newly generated bitcoins, but NOT if he is in posession of bitcoins already that he wants to doublespend. Most exchanges require 3-6 confirmations for deposits.


Your logic implies that 51% can't happen, because "people" would notice that during a long gap between blocks an attacker is hashing on his secret chain. I say they would not, so let's agree to disagree.
I will exit this discussion, as everything has been said. I see what you mean and what your point is, thank you for the civilized argument. Please note that I don't think that a 51% attack is very probable or profitable. But I don't like to see 4-5 large mining pools having 51% of hashing power, it is just not decentralized.
@_date: 2015-04-01 11:40:48


Never did. Peercoin is a hybrid.
You are defending Bitcoin, so you are defending currencies like dogecoin. Childs play.


The solution for protecting against rewriting the chain is simple, and was implemented almost since the beginning of PoS: Give every legitimate client in the network this rule: Do not rewrite history past n blocks.
Your turn: How do you convince a node to rewrite it's history past n blocks, when it follows the above rule?
@_date: 2015-04-01 09:30:44
PoW: The more hashrate you have, the faster you can build a chain. Peers follow the longest chain. = length matters
PoS: The more stake you have, the more often it is your turn to produce a block.
BUT: Peers follow the chain with the most stake involved (=higher cumulative difficulty), NOT the chain with the largest block height.
You should read this: 
"nodes will select the block with the highest cumulative difficulty value as the authoritative block"


Absolutely right. Everyone can build long PoS chains (I did). BUT the network does not care about length.
@_date: 2015-04-12 08:02:37


There have been gaps between blocks of over 1 hour. Agree?
An attacker with 51% generates 3 blocks during that time on average. Agree? Noone would notice if he did not broadcast these blocks and would fake pool stats on his website. As 1 hour gaps are common, how should they?
Global hashrate is an estimate, based on how fast the last few blocks were found. It is not measurable directly. There are no warning signs in the event of a 1 hour period with no blocks, as mining is a probabilistic process, and 1 hour gaps are to be expected. Agree?
@_date: 2015-04-01 14:23:57
You have good questions. I like people that think about stuff in depth.
The network does not know which chain is "real" a priori. All peers compare their chain and select the one with highest cumulative diff.
Meaning: In the very very unlikely event we discussed, if I really was the only one forging on the planet (I don't need internet to do that), then my chain has good chances to become the best chain after the other peers join again. But if after 10 blocks a peer would join that was also active during the mega blackout, and it would have a better chain, then everyone would switch.
This all depends on amount of stake. You can introduce your chain. But only if you can outweigh all other stakes combined (meaning 51% attack).
Even this is impossible if we punish forgers that won't forge when it's their turn (because then you will have to forge on the main chain + on your fake chain, meaning you can never outweigh the main chain)
@_date: 2015-04-13 07:26:02


Well, this is exactly my point! A single long block gap is enough for an attacker, but gives very little information! How to find evidence of an attack if one block gap of 1 hour only gives you very little statistical information?
The investigators do not see the "secret" 3-6 blocks of the attacker, until he broadcasts them. They have no way of knowing them.


I'll say it one more time: You cannot measure hashrate directly, and a gap of 1 hour between block has very little statistical significance.
@_date: 2015-04-01 14:04:47


Good. Thank you.
You can, but the rest of the network can verify time between blocks and diff independent from you.
We are talking about two things.
Time: Is needed that blocks are generated. The longer the time between blocks, the easier to hit the target, because base target = previous blocks base target value multiplied by the amount of time that was required to generate that block
Stake: Influences Cumulative Difficulty a lot.
You can fake time only to a certain degree. because:
* No client will accept a block that was generated more than 15 sec in the future or past (compared to local system time).
Meaning: An account generates a block before you do, but you would be able to produce one with higher diff. If you wait more than 15sec, and then broadcast it, it will get rejected. OR if you forward time too much, it will get rejected too.
AND this is also important: The maximum target value is 1.53722867 x 1017 and the minimum target value is one half of the previous blocks base target value. Meaning that you can't fake time too much to increase cumulative diff a lot.
@_date: 2015-04-01 10:55:48


Please read the link I posted.
Hint: Time has something to do with cumulative difficulty.
@_date: 2015-04-09 10:08:04
3-6 blocks.
Some traders require at least 6 confirmation, some require at least 3.
51% attack. Double spending against a large exchange for example.
The pool controls what to do with the generated block, not the individuals. If I was a &gt;51% pool, I would fake the stats on my web page for a period of 3-6 blocks, so less miners would notice that I did not broadcast my blocks during that time.
@_date: 2015-04-01 11:03:15
define "short".
My definition: 6 blocks
@_date: 2015-04-10 07:22:22


No it would not be obvious (for six blocks). It's called variance. Have you ever seen a 60min delay between blocks? It happens from time to time, and the bitcoin community suspects nothing (because usually nothing happens)
For reference, see: 
@_date: 2015-04-01 10:49:22
Seems that you ran out of arguments and turned to "Proof that Nobody gives a shit".
Fact is that people were not able to break a good PoS implementation up until now.
Your turn to prove me wrong.
@_date: 2015-03-30 15:45:41


A bad PoS implementation can only fail if 51% of the stake are given to the same (or colluding) party.
A good PoS implementation will be secure even then.
@_date: 2015-03-31 11:23:14
With almost infinite amount of computing power (magnitides more than the current bitcoin network), the only thing you could do is to generate PoS blocks twice as often as you normally would.
so 10% active stake + almost unlimited computing power  = You would produce 20% of all blocks.
Sounds bad, right? But to have a LOT more computing power than the bitcoin network is unlikely, so in reality your stake grinding attack will cost a lot and will only improve your chances to produce a block by a tiny bit. And if all participants of a PoS network would constantly try to grind stake, the effects would cancel each other out.
A bold statement of mine, so let's look in reality: Stake grinding is supposed to be super easy in every PoS coin. Then how do you answer this:
Look at: 
and see here:  that total active stake is ~ 47%
Now show me an account that is grinding stake, i.e. producing significantly more blocks than he should. (hint: I see account forging less than they should, but none that forge a lot more than they should.)
Question: Why don't we see stake grinding in real life? Incentive would be there.
@_date: 2015-03-31 11:36:03


Not long chains, "heavy" chains. You can't create your heavy chain in secret if the rest of the network prevents you from withholding blocks.
And in order to be able to create heavy chains, the cost is aquiring the necessary stake.


No. Have you ever seen a PoW/PoS fork deeper than, let's say 720 blocks? How would you get such a netsplit?
This rule is currently in use on mainnet in Nxt, and I haven't seen a netsplit so far. If my peer sees a heavier chain 719 blocks in the past, it will reorganize that part.


Ok. Try to flood UDP port behind firewall with filter rules. It's not easy.
@_date: 2015-03-30 15:40:13
Short version:
Every legitimate client in the network agrees that:
* The best chain is the one with most stake involved
* Blocks older than n blocks shall not be rewritten
* If an account is known with realtively high probability to generate the next block (this is already done, see:  but skips his turn (because he wants to build a secret longer chain), he is not allowed to generate the next n blocks.
* The Genesis block is hardcoded into the client.
Your turn: How would you attack?
@_date: 2015-03-30 15:52:10


Then this chart is lying: 


After the 5 pools killed bitcoin by double spending, then stakeholders can choose new miners, but noone will care anymore.
@_date: 2015-03-30 15:10:07
This seems to be an issue of socioeconomic nature.
The question is: When will the majority of users be careful enough to not give their money to third parties?


This is not possible anymore in a good PoS implementation.
@_date: 2015-03-30 15:57:29
Agreed. But in an (unlikely) event of an attack, this does not matter as an attack takes not a lot of time.

Your statement sounds a little too aggressive. I could counter:
Bitcoin is controlled by 5 central bankers aka mining pools.
There are many ways to minimize the risk in PoS:
- Distribute 100% of the coins for free (check for sockpuppets)
- Do a PoW phase for distribution (largest miner gets most = not very good imo)
- Do an open IPO with cap (check for sybil attack, do taint analysis)
How would the central bankers keep their power in these scenarios?
