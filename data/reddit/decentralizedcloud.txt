It is a good idea, I was excited for golem and then realized that golem is making the same mistakes of cpusage and the several other distributed plays that came before it. Requiring people to re-write their applications to utilize various "one-off" compute tasks like blender rendering will never achieve mass adoption. Sounds familiar, oh that's right every distributed compute play starts with blender tasks? Just for reference this was the cpusage.com "discontinuing service" email. We need something like Golem but entire virtual machines that can run applications as is.
"Through this process (cpusage.com) we’ve had to make some tough decisions. One of those decisions has been particularly tough. We have decided that to properly serve our demand-side customers, we must forego deploying our tools on-top of infrastructure from partner computers, like yours. Instead, we will launch next week using popular public cloud infrastructure such as AWS, Rackspace, and others. This decision allows us to better meet customers technology requirements while allowing us to operate a business model that enables us to thrive."
If you find yourself turning to amazon for your distributed compute project you quickly come to realize that it's amazon who is the real technology and your layer is superfluous.
I still have hope though, someone someday will indeed get a real decentralized virtualization platform to actually work with the blockchain.
Just for reference, I've been working on distributed compute projects like distributed.net, boinc, etc. since the late 90's. I would love nothing more than for someone to get it right. Golem is in it's early stages, so perhaps they can correct course.

Golem is a bit of a joke, doesn't anyone remember cpusage.com?
