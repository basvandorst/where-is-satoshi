the last audit was in 1953 and there was a visit to ONE of the smaller vaults in 1974. but that's about it.

for starters I guess you could  say there are energy costs for the transportation of physical money. not just from fed to banks but from you/business to/from bank.
electricity verses oil/coal...
EDIT: misunderstood post.

if price of acquisition &amp;amp;lt; value of bitcoins than a profit is made. 
this is my guess.

This is seriously the 4 time China has "threaten" bitcoin in the past 6 months. Every time the market crashes and then rebounds a few days/weeks later. 
if you could control the price of a commodity that'll have no negative effect on your economy simple by talking about it, wouldn't you? 
China's banks are more than likely trying to profit off Bitcoin verses considering it a threat (at the moment). Maybe down the line you're right but definitely not now.

because it's incorporated and located in the US which means it has to follow US business law.
Bringing cryptsy to court because they withheld funds while they artificial decrease the price before paying out will be far easier to prosecute than with a Japanese/Russian based company. ( granted, I'm assuming you're located in US)
Notice how GOX paid out its japan located customers? Yes, this is probably a don't shit where you eat thing but  I'm willing to bet  there would be some legal ramifications if they hadn't.

Of all states West Virginia should be embracing Bitcoin. Their state motto is "we're open for business" because they're so desperate.

If it was still there they'd let members of congress see it but they don't. No one can see it. No one can audit it. last time someone did they handed them one gold bar and showed them, from a distance, one (of the smallest) rooms which had what appeared to be gold bars stacked up. 
same with the fed. These are places that just don't get audited.

"so you can"
i don't get it. what is that supposed to mean?

66 units x 375watts = 24750 watts/1000 = 24.7kwh*$.04 * 24 hours= 
 or
$.04 is awesome. i'd be paying $2311 where i live.

my question is why does the government give bonds to the fed when it could just use those bonds as legal tender. assuming those bonds would look like money...what would happen if we cut out the middleman?
we could even create a set batch of new money ever few years, through some simple equation,  to meet the amount of newly created goods and services. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 04:35:40
bitcoin is, for the most part, set in stone. You know the supply is limited. Fees for miners keep the network ledger updated. As goods and services are created there will be an inflation of value unlike fiat where there is an deflation of value with newly created money.

can't you just exchange for another fiat currency, like USD, and convert that to yen? I feel like there are business opportunities here.

"Granted, I'm assuming you are"
meaning I assumed wrong. Relax.
I merely meant that It's easier to  deal with a business located in my own country. that has to adhere to my countries business practices. Wouldn't you trust a Australian based company more than a Russian one?

Do you not know how to read the charts?
Over the course of 1 month it went from $200 to $1200. Started November 2013.

my advice. don't go for the "nice round" number. Sell just under that. So many people people do that...look at the graphs when it hit a grand and look at the volume price fluxtuation right before. I bet there was a lot of volume between 985-999.
