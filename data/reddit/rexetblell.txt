Smart contracts are simply computer programs that can be executed on a blockchain. The term "smart contract" is a little misleading.

That's nonsense. Vitalik does not have absolute power over Ethereum. Do some more research.

Unfortunately it is hurting Bitcoin, but at least it's accelerating the flippening.

Also, if bitcoin completely fails, people might lose faith in cryptocurrencies in general. This would not be good for Ethereum.

Andreas is just exploring the technology behind Ethereum, trying to understand it, etc. He does not own any Ether as far as I know (or very tiny amount). He is still 100% behind Bitcoin, so please stop attacking him after all he's done for the community.

You could have some algorithm where first you convert the input into a random program, then run the program for a billion steps. Then convert the program state after a billion steps into a 256 bit hash value. CPUs would be an ideal for this algorithm because this is literally what they were designed to do: run arbitrary programs. If you can come up with an asic that would do a better job than a CPU, then you beat Intel at their own game!

He is one of the smartest people in crypto space. You should think some some more about what makes you think otherwise. Also, ideas should be judged independently from who is saying them.

Yes, I made many transactions on this decentralized exchange: 
No central party ever controls your coins when you're trading there. It's amazing!
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:41:55
Also, in Ethereum it was possible to write a contract that checks "what chain am I on?" by looking at the balance of The DAO contract. This mechanism was used to split the coins. Is something like this possible in Bitcoin?

Let the flippening begin!

I think he just really wants to understand the technology behind Ethereum and writing a book is a great way to do that. This does not mean that he believes in the vision or that he is converting his Bitcoins into Ether.

Very cool! I built a similar game to yours on Ethereum!
The game also uses a 19x19 board but is simpler than go. The object of the game is to put 6 stones of the same color in a row. The cool thing is that the winner is verified on chain (so it's impossible to cheat). And you could also play for money, the blockchain would automatically pay the winner.
Here's the on-chain code that verifies the winner.
To actually try it, you need to download Mist.

The development is basically finished. My game can also be called a smart contract. All the moves live on the blockchain forever (this is the address of the contract: 
When someone makes a move, they send the transaction to that address with the coordinates of their 2 moves: 
In the above transaction you can see that the move was [5, a] and [7, 8], (a is 10 in hex). The web interface allows you to browse moves in games that have been played in the past.
The contract allows many games to happen at the same time (unlimited). Here's a transaction that creates a new game:
I developed it to learn programming on the blockchain. Yes, it is feasible to play, but it costs 3 cents per move at the moment. It would be useful if you want to play someone for let's say 1000 USD, but both players don't trust each other. This implementation would 100% guarantee that the winner will get paid. (you can win either on time, or it will be verified on chain that you have 6 stones in a row (moves are stored in a 2d array on chain)).

That's true, but there are some that have no debt at all (like in Europe). Even graduates in the US with debt will still allocate some percentage of their income to crypto if they believe in it.

In the future it will be possible to use BTC directly to get a loan of DAI (without having to convert BTC to eth)

Great explanation! This should be at the top.
What Vitalik means is that the ability to keep track of things it's more important than having a very expressive programming language to build a lottery. It should be possible to build a lottery with a very limited (not turing complete) language as long as you can keep track of the state easily.
@_date: 2017-04-18 23:51:23
Can you give a few examples of such attacks? I'm genuinely curious.
@_date: 2017-04-18 23:46:45
Yes, and Ethereum does provide great ways to store state. For example, you can have maps that map from an arbitrary data type to another arbitrary data type. For example a map from address to integer is what is needed for tokens such as REP. A transaction can easily update arbitrary maps. It's absolutely amazing!
It's amazing that the data types are arbitrary. You can have a map from string to a map from integer to address. (Nested maps). And the cool thing is that none of this is hard coded. You ask for whatever map you need from Ethereum when writing your contact, and Ethereum will provide it.
Also, the size is the map is not limited! Maps can be arbitrarily large. It's incredible!
@_date: 2017-04-18 23:37:51
Well said. Some things that people are saying here is absolutely absurd and ridiculous. It's unbelievable!

Take a look at this stable coin: 
There are tens to hundreds of smart contacts working together to keep it stable. This is a great Tether replacement. It took over 3 years to develop these smart contacts.

Dai is much more transparent than Tether you can see exactly what's going on. There is no centralized party in charge, so Dai is completely decentralized.

If anything, when buying bars of gold for storing value, you are making it harder and more expensive for people to use gold for manufacturing and electronics. So you are causing harm when investing in gold.

I use the Jaxx wallet, and I can send Bitcoins without problems right now. The reason why you can't send money is because your wallet sets a fee that's too low (it doesn't let you set high fees). Not sure how to get money out of your current wallet. Maybe give it a few days for the transaction backlog to clear and for the fees to go down. You can also ask for help from more experienced users on this subreddit.

Names are assigned using an auction system (which is also a smart contract). This contract is live and being used heavily:

Unfortunately I don't know where to find such a chart. The closest thing is probably the daily gas used chart: 
There many of them though (maybe 40%). Every transaction that involves one of those ICO tokens (and there are a lot of them) is a contract transaction.

Here's a wallet idea that can be implemented on a smart contract platform. The wallet can have several users. When a user initiates a transaction, there is a waiting period before that transaction is actually executed. The waiting period can be different for different users. Users who have a lower waiting period (which means they are more privileged) can cancel the transactions initiated by users with a higher waiting period.
The way to use this practically is to make yourself a user with a waiting period of zero. Give your close family a key with a waiting period of 1 month. Give your acquaintance a key with a waiting period of 1 year. This way if something happens to you, your family will be able to access the wallet after 1 month. Also, if you see that your acquaintance initiated a transaction trying to take your money, you can cancel the transaction immediately and remove his ability to access the wallet.
This also protects against losing your keys. If you forget your password, you can ask your family to help you get the funds out of the wallet (you'd just have to wait 1 month).
