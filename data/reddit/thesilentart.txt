So i dont really understand the bitfinex hack. I keep all my btc on a flash drive in a safe at another persons house. Did these people keep theirs on an online storage site?
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:23:48
So I have a wallet on my computer that is a change address and whenever I open the private key it says *if you can read this then anyone can and can steal your BTC* am I opening the wrong one? It doesnt seem as though I can actually access the actual wallet that way albeit my wallet shows the true balance on it.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:03:15
This is basically what I am going through here. Like I see on the blockchain that my coins are in the wallet on my PC and I made a copy of an older wallet.dat that I then added on here after my laptop was stolen. I was able to send some in the past and then this happened last year? Earlier this year? I can't recall exactly but when I am attempting the electrum sweep it shows like 5 things listen with each saying 0.1 at the end and the odd man out ends similar to 0.00001
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:39:18
At least you aern't in my shoes. I bought 2.5 BTC back in early 2013 and held it on multibit, made backups of the wallets/ private key file (thinking that was the right way to do it) on flashdrives, and stored them for safe keeping just in case. Subsequently had my laptop stolen 2 months after I moved out and turned 21, and recovered the wallet on a used desktop i bought way down the road. Tried to send some and it worked once or twice before realizing I had no BTC...wtf, i only spent like 0.2 total. Apaprently the rest of it went to a "change" address that I had never seen before in my life. I have been trying to find a way to access it over the last 2 years due to medical issues and not being able to work in my field without being in terrible pain 3/4s of the way through the day. At least you have some money....be thankful
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:15:23
I wish I had $100 or even $10 of BTC right now. As I have been looking at my wallet, checking private keys, reading support posts, etc. it seems like there is a smaller and smaller chance to retrieve my Bitcoin....I feel like I have let myself and my family down hardcore..

Since there are a few things I personally struggle with that are being talked about more and more often nowadays I would implore you to look into "To Write Love on Her Arms". It is a non-profit which aims to present hope for people struggling with addiction, depression, self-injury and thoughts of suicide while also investing directly into treatment and recovery. If you donated to that charity or any charity that targets similar issues I would be forever grateful.

So it seems as though every week/day someone has something to say about one exchange or another. If you're smart you'll buy your BTC/LTC and then put it in a personal wallet. Stop complaining about "(insert exchange name here) is the next my Gox." BTC-e is anything but Mt. Gox. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 20:20:11
Let's be real here, Mt. Gox may have been the most widely used exchange but they were very difficult to use and they made it difficult to get any support. Everyone complains about every exchange but the whole Gox incident was going to happen regardless.

Any particular one I should choose? It was importing my private key yesterday and then it was stuck there for a while before I had to turn off my computer to get it to go away. I even terminated the process and the screen was still there which is a first.
@_date: 2017-01-16 08:04:37
Ok well i just downloaded the next version of multibit classic to allow me to change the fee and when I went to try and send the btc the send button was grayed out so I clicked get private key and I got a message saying do not send BTC to this address as you will be unable to retrieve them. I have my original wallet on a flash drive in a safe somewhere so it is looking like I may just have to go and get that and hope for the best. I am syncing every wallet that I can see on my computer and hoping they are all condensed on one so I can try to remedy the situation but it looks like I may be screwed if I am unable to use the wallet they are in. This has never happened before so I don't know why it started this process now...

I wasnt aware of change wallets being a thing and there being a dual charge so money got sent to another wallet on my pc and i just had to find it and synch it and all my money was there on a clean wallet.
@_date: 2017-01-13 06:18:33
Ok, also I looked at that transaction that went through the other day on the blockchain and for some reason it has 2 addresses listed which makes no sense. The one I sent the $57 to and then the other one that all the coins were going to with an amount of $165.45
Transaction ID:81dc8d98fb4048e9934340f10b02fcfc13d1dcc3aa71317b51e5f03a25cd4d80 
@_date: 2017-01-13 06:14:18
I have the raw transaction for one I just tried that will not show up if that would help. I tried to send coins and the transaction is not on blockchain or blockexplorer. Its strange because I sent 35$ worth of BTC like 4 or 5 days ago with no issues and the transaction went through but one I tried last night did not nor did the one today and that is when I noticed something was awry
@_date: 2017-01-16 04:39:40
I am on Multibit classic and have 5.18 installed so I assume i need to install 5 .19 since my version doesnt have a way to change the transaction fee
@_date: 2017-01-14 05:14:41
Now I am having an issue where I am unable to consolidate all of my coins in one wallet. Whenever I send the coins now they will jump back and forth between the two, I am unable to put a password on there either. Where did I go wrong?
@_date: 2017-01-13 06:12:12
It is odd that even when I go to the help contents it says 301 moved permamently. Maybe I just need to put the original wallet/keys back on here. This one may be corrupted or messed up. But yea, I don't have any of those 5 transactions on my transaction history and when I try to send any of it I just get the transaction not confirmed triangle and the transaction will not show up on blockchain or blockexplorer. It just says transaction not found

What wallet would you recommend?
@_date: 2017-01-17 02:20:13
It is multibit and it is more than likely a change address but I don't see how I could access it unless its on my computer somewhere
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:50:08
They could always liquidate immediately or put a stipulation up that would protect them.
@_date: 2017-01-13 05:36:27
I am looking at it and it looks like there have been 5 transactions that did not show up on my wallet and they have sent the majority of it to one address and I have no idea how this has happened...
@_date: 2017-01-13 05:40:51
This is the most recent transaction that I am seeing. It looks like whenever I try to make a transaction it send it but it doesnt send to the address I requested and someome has made transactions without me wanting to. It never showed up in my transaction history except the transactions I made so it is almost like someone has my wallet somewhere else and I cant use it but I can see it. I dont know what to do and they already took 2.2 :( wtf
@_date: 2017-01-13 05:32:32
Multibit, what info do you need?
@_date: 2017-01-15 22:10:14
Thank you for this ill try when I get home :)
@_date: 2017-01-13 15:46:01
I found it but it was in a separate wallet that I wasnt aware of that mustve been made for change. I let it sync all night and the 4th extra wallet that syncd had the 5 transactions. It is quite strange that that is a thing. Had btc since 2012 and this is the first time I have experienced this
@_date: 2017-01-13 05:59:45
I also see that I have a few more wallets on my pc than I usually do and am synchronizing them to this client to see if they are in theee
@_date: 2017-01-13 06:08:26
I have the original on a usb in a safe so I guess i will get it out and see if that works.
@_date: 2017-01-16 22:17:20
I have seen posts on this subreddit where BTC were sent to the wrong address and someone claimed it as theirs and they were able to sort it out...just a last hope
@_date: 2017-01-13 05:58:45
So how would I go about doing that, I am very confused as to how this happened and have all of my BTC on a wallet in a safe. Theoretically if I recovered the original wallet I would have all of the BTC back or is it just somewhere else. I dont know how they moved
@_date: 2017-01-13 05:09:52
As well as for the help contents it says 301 moved permanently cloudfront
@_date: 2017-01-13 05:32:21
Multibit and  by transaction id which line of info would that be?

@_date: 2017-11-26 18:54:51
I had my laptop stolen and I have a backup of my wallet data but it sent my 2 BTC to a change address I can't access. I can see it sitting there with no way to access  them. So i only have  about the same as you right now op. Shit sucks since I need to get back surgery/ dad just went to the hospital a few days ago so bills are piling up.

@_date: 2017-11-20 21:29:22
is there anyway for me to find the seed phrase if I have access to my wallet? I will pour through all of my paperwork when I get home as I may have the original private key on there but I made it it 2013 when I wasn't as familiar with Bitcoin as I am now, nor was this an issue at the time.

@_date: 2017-11-26 21:33:49
I did but for some reason when I pulled my wallet up on my PC whenever I would make a transaction it would send some to a different wallet. For example: I sent .02 BTC to address XYZ and it would also send 1BTC to this one wallet we will call MOP, in the past it would send the 1BTC to my wallet which we will call ABC. After I opened my wallet on my PC instead of sending the amount I wanted to XYZ and then sent some BTC back to my wallet (ABC), It would send the "change" to MOP.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:05:33
It is multibit classic and I can import the private key but cannot see it in plaintext.

I had an issue with my wallet a while back where none of my transactions would to through and instead seemed to go to a change wallet which I had never heard of or even seen prior to this happening. I couldnt access or send any of my BTC for some reason except like .053 of one and I don't know why I can't touch them or when I try to send them even more than I spent goes somewhere else and the amount I try to send doesn't show up on the blockchain and stays unconfirmed forever for the most part. It is very frustrating as I had like 2.3 BTC and it seems they all went to a random change wallet that I cannot access. So fucked.

Thank you, its going to take ages for them to sync but I believe the change address would be on one of the 3 other wallets I have in the same folder since those would be the only place they would go. I will keep you updated and thank you so very much for your patience and help

It would be similar to one of those commercials on television where they ask for you to donate "12 cents a day saves 5 lives" in a foreign country. Well suppose those 12 cents had a high exchange rate and it is rising steadily enough, that if smartly traded could theoretically quadruple what you have. It is a smart gamble, but be honest with yourself. Bitcoin will not crumble anytime soon. Bitcoin is easily traded and it does not have to suffer from high exchange rates. It surpasses all of the currency exchanges from other currencies.

I originally bought in at $15 a piece last year and foolishly used them. Shortly afterwards they shot up to $70 per coin and I tried to get some investors. My father allowed me to invest some of his money when they were hovering in the $1000-1400 range. I am just curious as to what everyone personally believes will happen in the next few months. It is purely speculation but I believe Bitcon will truly become a sign of our world being unified. Imagine if there was a currency that was accepted all throughout the world as opposed to dollar/yen and whatnot. I believe they are here to stay but it will be a long time before we see what its final place in this world is.

Coin base has been my go to for buying BTC for a few reasons. First of all, as you said, they will honor your original buy price. Secondly it takes them a few days to put the coins into my account so I don't panic sell if there is a crash. Thirdly their customer support is amazing and gets back to you very quickly.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:02:04
I'm loving how the price has risen and it really is history. It hurts for me a bit because I bought 5 when they were 15$ a piece but had them on a friends wallet that we shared. He still have the .5 btc that was left over and now I have nothing :s

@_date: 2013-12-19 05:37:37
You have to look at it from the perspective of a newcomer to bitcoin and this could essentially turn them off from it completely with such a drastic crash. Those of us who have been here for a while understand it but to a newcomer it could be a deterrent.
