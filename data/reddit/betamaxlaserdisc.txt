My Magic 8 ball said "yes" and you know what they say about 8 balls, squirrel nuts, and Bitcoin.

I'd say the message from this is that Bitcoin isn't secure.  That magic internet money made by hackers and promoted by hackers will end up in hackers hands.

This is good for Bitcoin!  The Beef O' Brady bowl was the biggest joke of all the unnecessary bowl games because of it's corporate name.  Now people will compare Bitcoin to the stupidest of corporate bowl games.   To the moon!

Abolishing the IRS, which is what the RNC statement says, and adopting bitcoin are two completely different things.  I mean,  you might as well say they're excited for Star Wars VII because they want to abolish the IRS.  That's how much the two have in common.

When invited recently to throw out the first pitch at a baseball game, 50 blamed his ridiculously bad home plate throw on too much masturbation.  The same can be said for his (music) handlers who told 50 that he was "a ground-breaking technology" who would "singlehandedly undermine some of the world's most fiat-corrupted governmental agencies in the world" through his music.  None of that's going to happen even if he is/ was groundbreaking.  But hey, buy his new CD with bitcoin, it's the only audience he's got right now.

An MMORPG aimed squarely at cryptocurrency evangelists?  Sounds like a sure-fire hit to me.  If they'll support 50 cent's music career, I can't imagine the crazy coin they'll donate for a cryptocurrency MMORPG.  Bitcoiners here will donate what money they don't have tied up in bitcoin, and they won't expect the game to ever get off the ground.

If you really want to get stores to accept bitcoin, point out how it can make them more money: namely that transactions aren't reversible and there's no swipe fee.  Evangelizing about bitcoin like a Jehovah's Witness just turns people off.

The fact that Bitcoin needs people to evangelize and lie to spread the message is a sure sign of failure.  
E-Mail never needed to evangelize door to door like a Religious cult to get where it's at.

I see what you're trying to do, you troll.  
You will NOT bring Bitcoin down by reminding everyone here that the Bitcoin Foundation is corrupt, wields way too much centralized power, and is the public face of Bitcoin.  
Nice try though.

Working  Making Bitcoin  Being Men  Mining Bitcoin
men are *generally* better than women at these things.  Studies have been done.  Do not deny human nature.  Because the studies have been done by men that prove it...
cooking  doing laundry  having babies  avoiding bitcoin
Women are *generally* better at these things.  Again, because men did these studies, and it's all been proven.  Besides, Satoshi was clearly a man, because *generally* Satoshi is a male name.  Unless they're reddit men, who *generally* are right to think that all women are sexist feminazis who want our bitcoin.
Obviously women do have a place in the home, but I would argue that it is not *generally* as breadwinners or decision makers, and certainly not as bitcoin earners.  The women will be valuable cooking, washing dishes, doing laundry, and as stay at home moms raising kids, or making themselves look good when their husband comes home. 
PC police note that my use of *generally* doesn't mean I'm *generalizing*, it means Bitcoin is for men, and too confusing for women.

Why is everyone bashing paypal?  Because it's only set up for fiat?  Well, how could it be set up for bitcoin when bitcoin transactions aren't reversible?  I don't like blaming the victim, but this sort of thing is predictable, and not Paypal's fault.
Seems to me it's the fault of the scammer for being a scammer, and greedy risk-taking of the OP.  Blaming Paypal is like blaming the dark alley when your transaction goes south instead of the crook or your own greed.

Great!  Will my bitcoin purchases be insured against scam sellers that will flock to a new userbase that's *ahem* used to being ripped off?

Bitcoin: where smart greedy people rip off stupid and smug greedy people... and provide a firsthand education on why regulations and government oversight exist.
