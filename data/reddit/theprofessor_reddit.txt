I'm really sorry about not doing research, thanks for the explanation

Can I just let it do its thing and what software is involved in doing so? And with the price if I can get more money out then I'll spend in I'm fine with spending a bit of money. Also could I have a website that sells miners?

Someone who know more about this, could they please explain to me why the value of Bitcoins spiked at 2014 and now is climbing up in value very quickly
@_date: 2017-01-22 11:28:49
It really increased in value quickly during 2011-2012, anyone who know more about this know why?
@_date: 2017-01-15 01:23:55
Any tips for getting started?

Yeah I know, I'll delete this one and do it the proper way. See ya

Fine, I won't abuse the power of my parents not knowing about Bitcoin mining. And thanks for telling me before I consider doing it
@_date: 2017-01-15 02:02:47
So how hard is Bitcoin mining and can I get it working and then leave it on for a week and get 10 BITCOIN's? Obviously not that much but just as an example is that how it works.

No ATMs for about over 1000KM (Australia everybody) but how does trading work exactly?
