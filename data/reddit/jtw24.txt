Your professor claimed that bitcoin cash failed? I understand BCH isn't popular here, but let's not lie to ourselves. It hasn't "failed".

Notice how people recommend a shitcoin to you, and when you ask for reasoning, all anyone can say is "dude, just google it, man".

AML/KYC laws exist, and by all accounts, are taken seriously by Coinbase. The crypto world has attracted a lot of attention over the past 12 months. Every Tom, Dick and Jane are "buying in", which means a lot of scammers and a lot of people who don't know what they're doing are wiring money around. Combine this with an exponential increase and users and it's no surprise that some people have problems or delays. 
The idea that Coinbase is a ponzi scam, stealing everyones money, based on one person's vague story, is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:26:50
Do you realize that coinbase has a 99% satisfaction rate? Even if thousands of users came out tomorrow and posted about problems, that would only account for a tiny fraction of users. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:01:56
My thoughts exactly. I hear BAT will hit $1000 this year too, and I swear I'm not holding bags.  ;-)
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:56:56
I think the main question is, "does it work well". As of now, it does not appear to work well. $2 USD is a high fee. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:56:50
Actually, my point is quite the opposite. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:55:06
But this is user volume, not Coinbase itself. If the platform closed, the user base would still be present, no? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:19:53
What about Gemini? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:48:21
So do you want an open protocol, where people are allowed to use the system as they want, or one where people tell other people how to use it? 
If you don't like Coinbase, don't use it. 
If one exchange can cause so much harm, then Bitcoin isn't very durable, is it? 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:41:59
I see zero chance of Facebook using Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:00:01
Coinbase is threatened by Bitcoin because it will replace them? This doesn't make any sense. 
The animosity towards coinbase is irrational on this sub. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:53:23
The behavior isn't new. People do that for all sorts of investments and gambling.

@_date: 2018-01-19 18:32:01
Yep, people have been talking a lot. It's the doing that's a problem. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:18:59
While that seems bad, many of the users are hyperbolic, and often it turns out there was user error, such as, "I used multiple identities on my account and now my transfer is frozen". 
While I think Coinbase can improve their quality, they are an extraordinarily fast growing company, and it's difficult to scale. Even if every complaint against them were legitimate, those complaints only account for less than a fraction of one percent of users. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:31:09
So, it's still factually a high fee, regardless of what previous fees are. If you'd like to argue that it's cheaper than previously fees, fine, but it's still overall expensive.

I have a hard time getting behind the "insider trading" accusations. It was clear for a long time that Coinbase was going to add BCH. The only question was the exact date and time.

Isn't BAT partnered with Twitch as well?
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:53:37
I know, but OP claimed they were. Also, due to KYC/AML regulations, you can't always just bounce a transaction back instantly. It has to go under review.

* The company could be in early investment and development.
* The company could be a shell company (quite common).
* The company could be a subsidiary for tax or other purposes.
* The company could function as a financier for related bitcoin developments and investments (as shown [here](
* The company serves an unknown, private group of people or organization.
* The company went out of business or lost funding during early stages.

Uhmmm.. what about the multiple compliant bitcoin businesses already in the US?
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:55:27
This doesn't make any sense. Bitcoin is at an ath. If you cost averaged over the last year, you would have made a large profit, not lost money. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:41:28
You disagreed, but never even addressed the point, lol. The value of a stock/asset/token is not dependant on external money being "injected". 
@_date: 2017-08-12 03:39:56
Cost averaging works over long periods of time, not several weeks or months.

@_date: 2017-05-04 14:50:48
Why not move the BTC to GDAX? Are you trying to buy/sell for profit strictly through Coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:01:12
That's precisely my point. Historically, gains based on pure hype, and without fundamental rationale, have corrections.

Lots and lots of people use TA. That doesn't mean it works. Lots and lots of people use voodoo too, and billions of people use prayer. Still, none of it works. Warren Buffet didn't get rich on TA.

It may be anecdotal, but I've had three issues with Coinbase/GDAX and all were solved within a few hours of contacting support. Although I see a lot of complaints lately, if we consider they have 7 million+ users, than the amount of unresolved issues is around 0.001%. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:47:29

This is the same sentiment I see all to often these days. If the price isn't increasing by a trillion dollars every day, people get complacent and then lose their minds. BTC is up almost 200% in 3 months, but yet somehow it's just not good enough. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 00:09:17
Those are charges of fraud, not a legal classification of cryptocurrencies as securities.

No, that's not how these things work. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:19:31
In theory perhaps, but I have yet to see a ruling that classifies ICOs as securities.
