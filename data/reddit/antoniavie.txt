Does anyone have any idea how all a sudden BitMEX becomes the largest volume exchange for BTC?
I like to believe the Seychelles (is where BitMEX is located) is giving Trump and US the middle finger for p;ulling out of the Paris Agreements on Climat Change, but I think it has more to do with the fact they have no KYC there.

Exactly, who knows what will happen in the next 17 years.
17 years is a long time and there could be a few more forked off altcoins/shitcoins and maybe having to secure a new address against quantum computer hacks.
I'd rather stay informed and stay in control, that's what holding Bitcoin is about ;)

Her daddy, my son in law is Turkish so she has dual nationality :)

Stop thinking about it and do it!
BTW: My mom and dad opened a traditional savings account for my daughter and the interest didn't even cover the inflation rate. 
That's why I prefer Bitcoin and the fact the banks and government are not involved.

If you want to applaud ... I don't really care :)
I just wanted to share my experience ... my Bitcoin story, maybe inspire others with how I feel about Bitcoin.

The idea came to me after remembering that my parents had a savings account for my daughter (now Zeyneps mother) when she was a baby.
They paid into that savings account every month and when she turned 18 she got the money.
Sad thing about it, as I remember that it hardly gained any interest and although it was a cool thing, it still wasn't worth it. Inflation and low interest rates, just ate away from its value.
Anything Fiat money wise is just a waste of time and value!
I'm not going to say Bitcoin will be worth a lot, or is the future of money, but I am going to say that Fiat money is not the future!
We've been lied to, deceived in believing the banks and government are looking out for us and doing their best for our prosperity.
If every parent, grandparent invests just some Bitcoin in their grandchildren/children then their future could be a much brighter place!
