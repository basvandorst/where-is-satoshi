lol how did Benghazi wind up on the list of absurd conspiracy theories? This is an event where the undisputed facts are that terrorists organised a deliberate attack on a CIA annex involved in smuggling guns to terrorists, killing several Americans including a US ambassador, and the government of the day lied and pretended it was part of spontaneous demonstrations against a YouTube video. Convincing people that being upset about it is comparable to "Jews did 9/11" is a pretty impressive work of spin.

If your retirement fund isn't big enough to safely buy a small crypto hedge, you're not retiring.

Well yeah, they could stop it by making us all rich. I have to say of the potential ways the government could kill Bitcoin, "making the price skyrocket" is my preferred option.

The United States isn't "one country", it's 25% of the world GDP, a treasury department that sets the rules for all world banks, the IMF, the World Bank. It's backdoors in most of the world's computers, near complete interception of electronic traffic, and a supercarrier in every ocean. I wouldn't expect them to actually be able to stop cryptocurrency, but they could make things really difficult.

Because we want Monero to be good for tax evasion and buying magic mushrooms, if some prick goes and uses it to blow up a Manhattan subway station the government will crack it, sabotage it or ban it, or possibly all three

I would say crippling fear of loss as well. I would have bought &amp; held BTC years ago if I hadn't been crippled by a poverty mindset that was more afraid of losing than interested in gaining.

Yeah but if crypto actually goes nuts enough to destroy the value of his retirement fund, a small hedge (say a $10,000 investment today) will itself be enough to retire on.

There's often a sharp drop before psychologically significant barriers like $10,000, no one wants to be the sucker that bought at 11,900 before it dropped back to 10,500. But at 12,100 that seems less likely.

It's essentially selling equity, and equity has the advantage as a fundraising strategy if your business goes south everyone goes south together, whereas if you borrow $1 million and your business goes south, you still owe a million dollars. But selling mining contracts apparently has the additional advantage over even equity that you can say "hey this isn't working out" and extinguish the mining contract.

It sounds like his BTC have only just overtaken his retirement savings. Given the timeframe, he could have bought as low as $250 per BTC, so he could have pretty solid non-BTC savings and still have them overtaken by his BTC.

If you're talking about aesthetic value you're talking about subjective value, which defines bitcoin and fiat currency and 99% of the value of gold. You really think people like gold so much that it'd be worth $1200 an OUNCE if it weren't for the component of value which is speculative in the same way bitcoin is speculative, albeit with a longer history and greater stability? Would it even be worth $100 an ounce? 
Look at this chart of historic gold production:
If gold weren't used as a wealth holding but only for its practical and aesthetic value, there'd be thousands upon thousands of tonnes of it available, mostly taking up space. There'd be an increase in the practical usage because of the massive price drop, but that would never make up that massive gap. It wouldn't be TOTALLY worthless, but if you had a few hundred thousand dollars invested in it at high price it'd feel pretty worthless.
Some things like seed, tools, building materials, and food have a certain degree of genuinely inalienable value due to their utility, but anything people invest in or hold wealth in, like precious metals, currency, most stocks, is valuable because of what other people will pay for it. The weird idea people get is that that's FALSE value. In fact that's the only way you can hold value above your personal utility, which in a first world context is a very small degree of value indeed, since beyond your immediate needs anything else you hold is subject to the brutal certainty of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility. 
Whatever you hold wealth in, unless you're very poor by the standards of the developed world, you're dependent on other people buying it from you to realise it as utility. At the moment people are very happy to buy bitcoins so they possess real value. It's quite likely people will shortly only be willing to pay 3/4 what they're willing to pay now, possibly half, very unlikely nothing (if system-threatening flaws don't emerge). The same risks apply to gold, currency and stocks, in lesser degrees.
Bitcoin may well be considerably less valuable than the current level of ~$1000, but it's definitely not without value. It possesses considerable value as a means for illegal transactions, and significant value to people who are ideologically opposed to fiat currency and the existing banking system, many of whom are quite wealthy in traditional terms. 
Sorry to anyone who's studied basic economics and found this condescending.

Gold availability is determined by demand AS IS BITCOIN AVAILABILITY, as is the value of *everything* beyond immediate utility, as is the value of stocks beyond their usually negligible dividends. 
Very few stocks offer dividends anywhere close to commensurate to their value, 2% is considered good and absolutely nothing is not uncommon - they're bought and held primarily for the promise of capital returns, without which you'd be mad to accept less than 5-10% dividends. So even in a conservative blue chip portfolio, two thirds to three quarters of the value is what you'd describe as "speculative", yet as we know shares held in the medium to long term almost always make strong returns. Bitcoin makes no return or payment, which is the exact same dividend returns investors have received from Amazon for 15 years.

You're grossly overestimating the effect of the practical applications of gold on its value if you think it would hold more than a few percent of its value when not regarded as a wealth holding.
