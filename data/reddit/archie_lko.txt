As you know, bitcoin is like gravity...all it takes is a little push.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:55:05
Well, Technological wise too, bitcoin is better than altcoins. Other coins might have increased the blocksize to reduce txn fees and txn time. But then, u cant really compare them with bitcoin cause they dont have the volume and traffic as huge as Bitcoin. They might look good now, but if they face volume as huge as btc, they might come up with hundres of new problems. 
Now, u said , u are not talking on basis of price, well, u should, cause its an important factor, Bitcoin's huge marketcap will only help it in reaching the masses, make it more and more decentralised in all way possible and making it robust and more immune to manipulation by big n powerful , rich institutions and individuals.

Their panic is real. 
After all experienced HODLers, like myself are just loosing profit. 
But new comer lose the seed money. Its obviously hard for them. 
I remember having panic attacks wen i first invested.

Many people know that a fraction can be bought, but the fact that one bitcoin is worth X amount, such a big amount, they feel they have missed the train. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:03:22
Not yet, although, I did pay a pay friend once, who paid for me at the store. 
Beside, in Japan its speeding up really fast. Many Bitcoin ATMs have been setup too. 
And last but not the least. I feel we humans, on a whole, are getting more sensible, driving towards a better planet. We need power to be decentralised, maybe not bitcoin, then some other currency, will sooner or later try to make its way in, deep in.

have you never felt they removed posts which were not necessary to be removed? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:52:02
I am sorry, i didnt get u
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:21:38
this post shud be removed. Claiming an uncommon exchange "the biggest exchange of Europe" is wrong, misleading.

Given all the pending transactions and transaction fees, I feel some advancement is necessary for Legacy Bitcoin. I see lot of hate for BCH. But i feel btc needs to improve. otherwise BCH might take over. Correct me if i am wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:34:16
how much?
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:03:17
Once it comes into mainstream use. Even if people would dont want to give it a value, people would still need it to make easy payments around the globe. That will create a real demand and not just "people giving it value cause they have a fomo". 
And then bitcoin will setlle, burst bubble whatever. 
Point is, whereever it settles, its gonna be much more than 9.7k 
So good work grandpa.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:23:24
why not bitcoin. It already have such a nice headstart. 
Yeah, bitcoin wont change the world. But it just reflects the attitude of the people. How people are taking decentralisation seriously. How they are keeping faith in such a system, system like bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:32:03
not an astroturf account. 
Someone stated an opinion how Bitcoin fees is too high. I feel its completely fine(even if his figures are wrong).  Nothing to be removed.
