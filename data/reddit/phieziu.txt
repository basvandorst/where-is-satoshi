If some people thought the halvening was going to cause appreciation, then they would be spreading their buys out over time, and it might cause possibly a 10% increase in demand. When the halvening comes, it will cause a 50% drop in supply.

10% is the breaking point. 90% of people are followers who instantly switch once we reach the 10% critical mass of users. At the same time, the legacy banking system closes it doors once 10% of people leave because it no longer has the funds. It can't sustain more then a 10% exit.  So this means that a $300,000 bitcoin will be the last bitcoin price we will see in dollars before it will immediately accelerate with continuously increasing momentum towards infinity dollars shortly there after.

These statements are good economics, but they really miss the problem we are facing with a block size increase. The cost for a miner to mine an additional transaction is near zero for themselves. Bitcoin is a decentralized shared ledger, and the cost of larger blocks is almost fully externalized to collective network. Having no limit on the block size would create a ‘tragedy of the commons’ situation where the only full nodes remaining would be those can bare the costs of whatever the other unrestricted participants push to them. What this means is if someone wants to spam the blockchain with as much pointless data as they feel like, they can, and the only people who would be able to run full nodes would be the people who are willing to bare the cost of storing it all. In the future I would like to see Roger talk about his view on having a functioning and efficient fee market.

Most rational people are in favor of a block size increase. It's just that no consensus has developed on a safe way to do it, or how much of a priority it currently is.
What we have learned is that it also requires taking into account how to develop a healthy fee market which doesn't make transactions too expensive but is expensive enough to dissuade spam.
The solution is easy. Implement Gavin's proposed block size increase schedule, and create tools for miners to create blocks which are of the size that support the development of a healthy fee market.
The only caveat of this would be if allowing larger block sizes could potentially be an attack on the network. I haven't seen any evidence to believe so.
@_date: 2015-08-26 20:54:30
Why does there need to be a block size limit at all? 
@_date: 2015-08-11 16:10:04
I feel like I'm stating the obvious here, but if two clients have incompatible definitions for what constitutes a valid block (such as no blocks over 1 mb or no blocks over 8 mb), then there will be two long chains of what each consider the longest chain of valid blocks. This requires miners to be split as well on which chain they recognize as having valid blocks, and miners would be adding to each blockchain. It's a blockchain fork.
Bitcoin-XT would be recognizing all blocks being produced as valid, but bitcoin core would be rejecting blocks over 1 mb. Which chain takes the lead for XT all depends on which chain miners are building on the most, because XT recognizes all the blocks as valid. But even if the XT chain has more blocks, bitcoin core will stay on the chain of blocks being produced that stays below 1 mb. 
The danger for XT here, is that even if the XT chain takes the lead for a while, if the bitcoin core chain catches up and becomes longer, then XT would have to flip back and revert to the original chain, potentially orphaning a huge chain of transactions. Users could be protected if they insured their transactions were always broadcast to both chains.
This is all theoretical. I don't believe the debate will ever come to this point. The financial incentives are too huge for the smaller group to not cave into the larger group.
Let's use Gavin's block size increase schedule, and start giving miners automated tools to produce blocks which support the development of a healthy fee market.

We can increase the hard limit, and miners can still soft limit block size to create the fee market.

" There’s a lot that Bitcoin or Ripple and variants can do to make moving money between countries easier and getting fees down pretty dramatically. But Bitcoin won’t be the dominant system. When you talk about a domestic economy, [you must have] the idea of attributed transactions, where if you sent it to the wrong person you can actually get the transaction reversed. [And a traditional system] doesn’t have this huge fluctuation where the value of your account is going up and down by a factor of two. We need things that draw on the revolution of Bitcoin, but Bitcoin alone is not good enough." - Bill Gates

People don't have to trust gravity. They are forced to obey it. Sunlight is a reality you can feel on your skin. Bitcoin as a medium of exchange is just a social construct with subjective value.

Kinda. But it doesn't use RPC anymore. It just connects as a full node now, and it downloads and stores the entire blockchain. It also uses its own wallet rather then just accessing the core wallet via RPC. So it's not lightweight at all.

I think you make a good point and I agree. Most people don't know how the existing banking system or debit card systems work. They just know that they do work, and that ask the stores around then accept credit cards, and they can get the things they need. This is the problem I see. People don't trust bitcoin because it in fact is not accepted by stores yet, and because it's not really easy to use or easily understood. I don't have a resolution for this yet. I'm not even sure how to inspire people to see what is possible.

Great question. To trust USD could be that you trust you can get the things you need with it, so you are willing to trade the valuable things you have for the green pieces of paper because you know other people will accept it.
