Hello beginners. Here is a quick experience from someone who’s not rich but spend some time in this market to give some basic advice. 
I follow cryptocurrencies since 2014 and started to invest in May 2017, when bitcoin was around 2K (but i went for ETH by that time)
I lost £1.5K (30% of my investment) in 6 months trading in ETH, Bcash, XMR and Bitcoin, buying from the peak and selling at the dip with panic every single time. In the last 2 weeks, i doubled my investment, told my self to calm the f down and hold, and i made £3K profit. I didnt feel stupid or bankrupt when i was losing, and i’m not feeling rich or genius because I made 3K in a week.
There is one simple reason: I didn’t invest more than i could afford. If futures or something else takes bitcoin below 10K and will never recover in two years, i will say “at least i tried”. The amount i may lose wont make me poor or affect my life standards. However, if it’ll reach 30-50K, i’ll make more than i saved in the last three years.
So, if you’re a beginner, just put what you can afford and hold until you reach your goal: paying your student loan, credit card debt, mortgage, buying a house or retiring. There are no investment accounts out there that can make you that much money.
But if you’ve already made over 100K profit like most of my friends did, you should be stupid to take the risk in times like this that can potentially take half of your profit you made in years. (Edit: unless you turned your profit into something that you can enjoy everyday)

I’m no expert, but looking at the last 3 days you’ll probably have the same opportunity tomorrow.
