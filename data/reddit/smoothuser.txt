I dislike when people use the term "try". That's like saying, "we try to sit in a chair". You either sit or you don't. Or in this case, they either are the best or they aren't.

He's got two call in shows each week where he takes questions about anything from anyone for about 3 hours. I'm sure he'd love to hear your concerns with his theories. I mean that in all seriousness.

Sometimes the best resource to a technical company is a non-technical perspective to a problem. Solutions to problems (technical or not) can come from a variety of personal experiences. People can just focus on their skills and apply then to a business that focuses on BTC. They don't even need to be an expert in BTC starting out, but they do need to be able to provide value to a company. Showing someone how you can provide value to them prior to any contracts or getting hired is a great way to show people you are committed and willing to work.

He recently apologized to Christians for his statements and approach on their religion and admitted he was wrong to be so hard on their choices.

While true, it was also after a lot of "estrogen based parasite" videos that were against 3rd wave feminism. Could have also been taken down due to "complaints" from those. Either way, hes getting to them!
