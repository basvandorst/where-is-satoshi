So your solution to "the codebase is fragile and unmaintainable" is to fight against the people doing the hard work of cleaning it up with modern software development practices and modularity to make it better?

I'm not saying his commits aren't meaningful in terms of workload, I'm just saying they aren't meaningful in terms of calling Peter a "very skilled programmer"
There's no evidence he is anywhere near as good as people keep saying he is.
@_date: 2014-12-15 15:05:35
You forgot to mention that his background is a fine arts degree. (seriously!) He doesn't have any software development experience prior to Bitcon at all as can be easily verified by his linkedin page. The value of refactoring badly architectured code isn't something you'll understand when you've never done any real programming before.
Just meet him in person at conferences and after a drink or two you'll hear him bragging about how little coding he does and how his "job" is 95% political manipulation.
Posting this as a throwaway because mods have banned people for criticising Peter Todd many times before.

I think you said it best yourself. He turns away people who could actually contribute, and spends time hindering the ones who are contributing right now.
Gavin has repeatedly called him out for how he's a toxic influence on development.

Noticed how he's been subtly trying to take credit for their work too?
edit: Here's an example, corrected by &gt; &gt; For instance, it's nice to see Blockstream implementing contracthashtool, an essential part of an old idea of mine for representing colored-coin-type assets undetectably


from 
Typical Peter behavior: proposes a broken idea, trys to take credit when people fix it, and is never the one to actually implement it. Another example is how he keeps getting credited for inventing stealth addresses by all his friends like Amir Taaki when he didn't originate the idea nor has he written any code related to it. But he sure did talk to a lot of journalists about it.

People say Peter is a "very skilled" programmer all the time but never provide any sources.
So, sources? Point to something he's actually done, rather than talked about.

Did you need to panic sodl when Peter sold half his coins?
Or add to his 4,000 twitter followers...

Did you actually read those commits? They're almost entirely minor documentation fixes, tiny features, and unittests.
Tests are important sure and I appreciate his work on them, but they don't mean you know anything about good software architecture or software engineering. He should be leaving that to the experts in that field rather than trying to troll on twitter.
@_date: 2014-12-15 16:24:59


You got it. Just a few days after his other attempt at trolling blockstream-employed contributors failed:
 


Notice how he makes a big fuss about "changing consensus critical code" and did yet another tweet about it when not a single line of that pull-req or the others jtimon is working on has anything to do with consensus critical code? Just a big PR effort to slam sidechains.
There's also this ridiculous effort too: 
Trying to make excuses for bloating the blockchain and creating scamcoins to make his inefficient proof-of-publication stuff work.
@_date: 2014-12-15 15:18:56
So he's an Amir Taaki, all substance and no code?
@_date: 2014-12-15 15:56:39
Btc Drak is his boss and is an altcoin scammer, not a Bitcoin developer. Obvious conflict of interest there.
@_date: 2014-12-15 16:52:01


And he's done absolutely no work on "Tree Chains" since he was hired. Don't believe me? Just look at his most recent blog post: 
Really makes you wonder what kind of scam they're pulling off.
@_date: 2014-12-15 15:29:57
Basically none of that code is actually used in production by anyone. With the exception of python-bitcoinlib it's all tiny proofs-of-concept. And python-bitcoinlib is a fork of Jeff Garzik's work, Peter hasn't added much too it other than breaking pynode's networking.
The repo with the second most commits in it is [Barbie and Skipper Fan Fiction](

You'd think Todd would have learned his lesson about [bad-mouthing competitors]( to his clients with overhyped FUD.
So are you are rolling out "merkle-sum" proofs for your exchange and Todd's using the opportunity to drum up business. As others have pointed they have nothing to do with solvency. A technical non-solution to a business problem. Nasty fear-driven marketing tactic that I hope the community sees through.
So how much is Todd getting paid for this bit of PR?
