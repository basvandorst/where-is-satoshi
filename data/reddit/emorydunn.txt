What a nice thing to do.

Following with another non-tech job: I'm a photographer and printmaker, but no watching the BTC charts live.

This looks great. There aren't nearly enough Bitcoin related applications for the Mac. I like the Tweetie inspired interface although, and this isn't directed at you, it's starting to get a little long in the tooth. 
I would suggest adding in some default content explaining the sections because at the moment there's a lot of nothing in there. I think Things has a good example of it. 
By any chance are you based in Europe? If so you might want to add some very simple localization for regions that use periods instead of commas. 
Also, it would be kind of cool to be able to run Hive on the testnet so we can try out all the features without fear of losing anything. 
I'm looking forward to seeing the development progress, best of luck.

I've got a Jalapeño that is currently mining around 0.1 BTC a week, so theoretically it will be for its self in around three months. 
For me, though, it's not nearly as much about making a profit and more about "ooh, a humming black box is making me money. Nifty."

Basically they make money from interest and from their debit cards. Or, for a better explanation, from their FAQ: 
If you don’t profit from fees, how does Simple make money?
Great question! Simple makes money in two ways, interest margin and interchange:
Interest margin is the main way banks made money for centuries (before the fees game). Basically, it’s revenue a bank earns from loans, less the interest the bank pays its customers on deposits. For example, if a bank earns 8% interest on its loans and pays 3% interest on its customers’ deposits, the interest margin would be 5%. Our partner bank splits this interest margin with us.
Interchange is revenue earned by a card-issuing bank when customers make purchases using that bank’s card. Our bank partners split this interchange revenue with us.
Additionally, since Simple is exclusively online, we don’t build or maintain branches, which keeps our costs down compared to the operating costs of traditional banks.

They've done it for a while, I'm not sure how long. It was in place when I initially signed up a number of months ago. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 23:31:46
Yeah. You can set up different speeds for when the payment is confirmed and BitPay sends confirmation. People use it for carts because it allows you to automate accepting bitcoins. So, for me, someone can visit my site, add items to their cart, enter shipping details, etc. and then select Bitcoin and wil pay via BitPay. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:52:22
That makes sense. It would be much easier, obviously, to get payed with Bitcoins by someone who already knows about them and/ or has them. 
It probably is best to stay away from the political aspect and go with the purely practical benefits. It's something that will hopfully get easier in the near future if people can either get Bitcoins easily and not have to worry about the technical side of things.

Tipping in bitcoin has been discussed before and I think it's always ended the same way: it's a bad idea. In the US while tipping is technically optional it really isn't. At a restaurant, for example, a tip of 15-20% is standard. You tip more if your service was excellent and less if it wasn't. 
A lot of people make a good portion of their wage through tips and would feel cheated if you handed them a card that said "I tip in Bitcoin - it's extra work for you so I probably don't have to pay extra."
I think for people you see a lot, a barber perhaps, you could talk to them about Bitcoin and when they understand it you could offer to tip in Bitcoin. It would be a great way to show them how it works after they have a wallet set up. 
I'd say if you really want to do some guerrilla Bitcoin marketing leave a simple information card along with your cash tip on the table with a big bright Bitcoin logo. Don't hold a tip ransom for figuring out how it all works. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 22:22:05
I wish you luck with it. I signed up as a merchant, so I'm looking forward to seeing how develops. 
@_date: 2013-06-29 23:05:10
I offer a discount through a coupon code visible at checkout. Also, Bitcoin is the default payment method. This is of course the super, really, almost invisible method of promoting Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-06-28 23:34:55
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:17:18
What you're looking for is BitPay's shopping cart system. If you log into your account there will be a button that says "My Catalog Items" if you click on this you can add items for people to buy. Add a new item, type in the details and then click "Save". 
Below this will be a variety of buttons that will give you HTML code you can put on a web page. Now when someone clicks this they will be brought to BitPay and can buy the item. 
@_date: 2013-07-14 16:27:44
This is true. If only I'd kept my iPad in its original packaging it would be worth the 17 thousand dollars. Now I know. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 01:46:32
I'm curious as to how you envision this working? Are you thinking of an online wallet that is linked directly with your normal account? If you are that could be quite cool: very quick and easy conversion between Bitcoin and USD as well as the possibility of being able to use Bitcoin through your already existing debit card. 
There are, of course, issues that would probably arise but it would be quite the niche for a truly modern bank. I'm all for the idea. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 21:12:07
Type the Konami code followed by "return". 
@_date: 2013-07-20 19:39:24
That's what I was thinking, putting the NFC component into something else. It's a really cool idea, but I'm not really a ring-wearing person. Now if only I had anything that would actually read and NFC chip…
@_date: 2013-06-28 23:22:49
The hardest part about accepting bitcoins, at least for me, isn't actually accepting bitcoins or cashing out but getting supplies. I accept bitcoins and that's all well and good, but in order to buy paper and ink and all of the other things needed for printing I have to use dollars. 
Now, on the other hand: if I had enough sales in bitcoins to cover the materials cost using Bitspend would be the perfect solution. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 19:04:23
Keep in mind that you do have to pay a small fee in order to make edits. 
Also, thanks for reminding me to update my listing. I'd almost forgotten about the wiki. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 21:41:49
You have a very good point. 
Yeah, accepting online is easy (digital currency and all: makes things easy) but in-store is a bit less intuitive. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 20:31:33
I would imagine so, there are people who've posted Etsy stores. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:45:31
No problem. BitPay doesn't have the cleanest interface ever, so it can be hard to find things sometimes. Let me know if you have any other questions. 
@_date: 2013-03-15 15:34:21
I like the idea, and I think there could be a market for it with one big caveat: you're going to have to make sure photographers get payed well enough. Good stock photographers can (or at least until relatively recently) could make a living off of stock sales. 
The "expensive" stock prices are the way they are because it's generally not individuals buying an image for a project, but large corporations buying an image for an ad campaign. A single ad could generate a lot of income for the company and if they can pick up the key image for $20 there's no way the photographer is going to be able to support themselves. 
I would love to see this happen, and as a photographer I would probably consider submitting. As long as I was getting payed fairly for my efforts. Out if curiosity: why do you want a Bitcoin stock photography site? Are you a photographer, do you just think there needs to be one, or something else? 
@_date: 2013-05-13 14:57:11
This looks very interesting, both for merchants and users. If I sign up as a merchant do I also get a debit card to use or is it one or the other? Also, does the debit card work like a normal card and can be used everywhere or only at merchants that use your service? 
@_date: 2013-07-21 07:19:55
I would love to make it onto a list like that, of course I probably need to be just a little bit more established. Perhaps I'll have to work on a Bitcoin related print. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:27:10
Congratulations. How did the family decide to pay in Bitcoins? Did they already know about them or did you introduce them? I'm a photographer as well, just starting out, and I love the idea of getting payed for shoots in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-07-13 22:43:26
Has the original iPad become cool again already? I've got one that I'd be willing to sell for only 150 BTC with a USB cable!
…… What? No takers? 
@_date: 2013-07-18 20:21:40
Tipping is an odd thing in the US compared to most other places. I heard a news report about a sushi restaurant in New York that you don't tip at and it was met with much confusion. On the plus side the staff is payed enough they don't need tips. 
As for receiving a tip in bitcoin I think it would depend greatly on the person. Someone who considers themselves a computer person might really appreciate it. Whereas someone who doesn't know that a web browser and the Internet are two different things would think you're a jerk. 
At the end of the day you can do as you please. In fact, if you do start leaving Bitcoin tips please report back, maybe it will be just the thing needed for Bitcoin as a whole. Personally I would start slowly with places you frequent where you've built up a reputation. 
I wish you luck.  
@_date: 2013-03-26 11:36:54
That's cool, although it's a shame they don't have any name brand equipment. 
@_date: 2013-06-29 17:31:25
Thanks. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:53:14
Now with a properly working link! 
I'm a printmaker and photographer who focusses primarily on landscapes, but I dabble in some more abstract work. All of the traditional prints are hand-pulled from a press, signed, and numbered. You can get 15% off your order with the coupon "bitcoin".
@_date: 2013-09-29 17:30:40
Something exactly like that. :)
I could certainly look into doing that. 
You are just a step ahead for everything, aren't you? That's perfect. 
@_date: 2013-07-20 05:45:02
Sounds like an interesting idea. Although the details are a little vague, I'm curious. 
EDIT: Thanks for the link. After reading everything on the website (which didn't take very long) it would seem like it's a pretty cool idea. You could set a "weekly budget" of tips to give and hand the link out to people you deemed worthy. The explanation of Bitcoin is also well done, it's concise but not so much that you might not understand. 
One question: What's to stop me from in turn giving the link I was given out to other people? Or is that a feature, not a bug? 
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:27:49
Hmm… food for thought. I guess the good news is I have a month to decide whether to get the ring or not. Best of luck! 
@_date: 2013-07-24 19:15:07
Cool! I'm in this article. I was wondering where that interview would show up. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 00:39:53
Awesome. Look forward to it. 
@_date: 2013-03-18 17:25:27
This is bizarre… I was literally thinking the same thing, and was about to go look up what people had done to hack the FuelBand, even to see if it would work just for cold storage. 
It would be very cool, even if it couldn't really be used to send coins, to be able to use it as a display to show a mini-key public address to receive coins or display your balance (after syncing, of course). 
@_date: 2013-07-20 07:07:01
Ok, so it's unique per person and not per pool. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 21:01:34
As someone who sells things via Bitcoin I'm all for this. I'll have to go find something to buy as well. 
@_date: 2013-07-20 08:05:50
That makes sense. That way you can tip someone multiple times. 
Glad I can help, it's always great seeing what people come up with. 
@_date: 2013-07-20 19:00:52
They have an option for just the NFC inlay, so you could put it in your own ring. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:23:04
It's great to see other artists accepting Bitcoin. I'm not going to lie: I wish I had lots of requests for me to accept Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 05:14:43
I guess, if you insist, I'll join in: [store.emorydunn.com](
Both traditional hand-pulled prints and photographic prints.

That makes sense. It sounds like your system is kind of a hybrid between loyalty/ gift cards and a payment network. It's an interesting idea and could do really well if you can get enough market penetration.
