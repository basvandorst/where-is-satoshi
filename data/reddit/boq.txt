I have explained that; the supposed creation from thin air is just a balance sheet extension.
Perhaps you are referring to what the central bank does. It takes some kind of deposit, for example mortgages on homes, and gives the banks that deposited them fresh money. That way, the money supply can grow to accommodate the growing economy.
Deflationary commodities like gold or Bitcoin can't grow with the economy, among other drawbacks. Yes, Bitcoin is subdivisible a lot, but other than that it really is just digital gold with all its advantages and disadvantages.

That's not how it works. Banks to not give out more money than they get in. The 33 is a theoretical upper limit for creation of deposit money at 3% reserves: I deposit $1000, the bank can lend out $970. If the next guy deposits all $970, the bank can lend out another $940.90 and so on. That results in a geometric series that converges at 33 times the original amount. In reality, people spend money they borrow, so the factor is way less than 33.
Bitcoin has its advantages, there's no need to spread misinformation about the established banking system.

You can get away with weed. You can get away with not paying taxes on your weed profits, but way less easily.
You can believe what you want. There's just no point of believing in some Bitcoin fairytale were you can opt out of the law. It's not going to happen, they'd rather make Bitcoin illegal altogether.

Money laundering is already illegal. Either exchanges (continue to) collect the identities of their users or they won't live for long.

Luckily, there is no sound in space, so the last guy is safe.

Everything is in the block chain. You think the finance ministry can't follow the block chain?
