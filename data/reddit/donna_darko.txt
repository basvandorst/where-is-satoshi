Now do the same chart but include market value lost in each crash.

Perfect questions, 38% upvoted only (mine included).
You have valid questions but this community doesn't want to hear them/answer them, instead they want to see how everything that happens around is GOOD for bitcoin and [that Dmitri likes it](
Just [look at this chain](
It is a dismissive community overall. Don't bother using reason, write HODL HODL HODL and you will get myriads of supportive comments.

I have taken a peak in this community from time to time for maybe a year and in my opinion it got gradually worse. One year ago, the ratio of good discussions vs memes&amp;HODL posts was good. Now, you have to dig a lot deeper for a good discussion.

As if there is only hyperinflation or instability.
FYI hyperinflation is extremely rapid or out of control inflation. What we have now in most of the developed world is not hyperinflation but inflation, just enough so people do not sit on their money but use it. 
Do you see hyperinflation in the USA, Canada, the EU, Japan?

Yes, to both. I did both of that. 
I have a Revolut card too with a significant amount on it and can instantly change to whichever currency I want and pay with it. All in a matter of nanoseconds.

I sent money to a friend today via the Revolut app. Took me two clicks and in an instasecond the money was in their account. 
Much less fees than Paypal or WU too (zero fees). Why aren't fintechs like that the future?
