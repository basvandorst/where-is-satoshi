Anyone who owned a bitcoin wallet containing coins before the fork got the same amount of BCH during the fork. They’re different block chains AFTER that point. It has nothing to do with whether or not the coins were in a wallet on an exchange. Having your coins on Coinbase just makes it easier to link you to your coins since they keep records and verify users. You still owe the tax either way.

There's nothing wrong with me, I'm just not on the rocket to the moon drinking the Kool-Aid. Bitcoin utterly fails to embody any of characteristics of money. Right now it's a speculative investment vehicle rather than a currency, but hey... if dehumanising anyone that doesn't agree with the current market mania helps you on some emotional level, well, carry on.

Beanie Babies?

People aren't "adopting" bitcoin, they're speculating on its value

This time.... it's different.

I guess you can't exchange beanie babies for drugs or fake hitmen on the dark web, so technically you're correct

You still have 1 Bitcoin though, no matter how far the USD price tanks you've still got 1 Bitcoin. So you've got that goin' for you, which is nice.
