I came for the Satoshi Nakamoto writings, but I stayed for the literature and mem pool articles.

Haha, I didn't realize the picture made me look *that* young! I'm actually a month away from 28 but we're all young with regards to bitcoin I suppose.

Here's the summary chart on a log scale I made two weeks back.

The cumulative return naturally approaches 1x as the chart moves closer to the reference date on the right end of the chart, therefore it's a mistake to interpret this as some kind of pessimistic trend.
The only purpose of the graph is to show the historical magnitude of gains that have come from holding just a few years or less.

The issuance of physical asset backed colored coins isn't addressed in this diagram, but it's a topic I'm working on next. You can't eliminate counter-party risk anytime you're using tokens redeemable for physical assets so physical audits are required to prevent inflation. I believe each of the servers in a voting pool holding any colored coins would have an interest in some regular auditing of the issuer. There's a wiki page on this topic that may be helpful.

Thanks! I really like the idea of a trailing return chart. Perhaps I'll get around to doing that one next.

I think Peter Todd's tree chains concept may address this...

Yeah, I consulted with him while making it and sent it to him yesterday right after I finished it. Luckily he had time to have it included in his presentation, which I hope went well.

The 12 month return line shows the gain from selling exactly one year after any given date as a multiplier (example: $20 to $60 = 3x return).
The 24 month return shows the gain from selling after exactly two years.
The cumulative return show the gain from buying on any given day and selling on 8/19/2014 (this was the day I made the chart).

Thanks! Something seems to be wrong with this tip though...

If you like my work and need something similar, send me a message. I'm always looking to develop professional-grade technical diagrams and charts in exchange for bitcoin ;)

An exchange running Open Transactions wouldn't have this issue because of the cryptographically signed receipts that prove ownership and the auditing protocol that prevents counterfeiting.

This is actually a quote from "No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority" by Lysander Spooner.
Great book - highly recommend read. A free audiobook version is at mises.org I believe.

To be slightly more specific and nuanced:
Those willing to hold rule.
Just like prices are determined not only by supply, but also by demand - it's the willingness to hold what one already has (supply) **and** the willingness to acquire more (demand).
This is one big problem with Proof of Stake - it only gives voice to past holders (supply) and not potential holders (demand). Only the price mechanism can synthesizes these two groups and drawing any conclusions from price signals still requires entrepreneurial judgement.
There's no such thing as an apriori way of predicting the economic preferences of a market without speculative risk taking. Discerning consensus is a fools errand. All we can do is place our bets and let the chips fall where they may. Any other proposed alternative is a veiled mechanism for inhibiting market choice.

The Node Pro has a 1 TB hard drive, a quad core processor, takes about 14 Watts of power, and has dimensions of 5.3" L x 5" W x 1.8" H (13.5cm L x 12.8cm W x 4.5cm H). Of course, it's the unique software which it runs under StashOS, that makes it so powerful.

Yeah, how's that Constitution working out?

The article does not address the morality of central planning, but the economic consequences. Bloated conglomerates suffer from the same dis-economies of scale and inability to allocate resources efficiently  without the benifits of the price mechanism and the interaction of supply and demand on calibrating the structure of production. The presence or absence of coercion is not relevant to this line of argumentation.
