crap, I don't have a webcam, can I still import the private key?
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:47:53
well, I knew it was a joke, sorry for you getting a bunch of downvotes.

I only have an iPhone. (First world problem I suppose)
@_date: 2014-01-26 04:19:51
I think I can do that if I try really hard. Thanks!

oh god, that's pretty scary. I feel kinda nervous about this whole thing.

what do you mean by learning the ropes with a smaller amount of money?
@_date: 2014-01-27 19:17:51
hey man, I'm sorry.

oh yeah, I completely understand. I understand about remembering passwords and encrypting wallets, the reason I haven't tried to do anything is because I don't want any of that to happen to me. It's all still on the paper wallet that the ATM gave me. I haven't shown the private code to anyone, and I won't try to do anything until I've learned what I'm doing.

agree with this 100%. If bitcoin is going to become mainstream, it needs to be understood by people like me. I have no knowledge of computers (which begs the question why I bought them in the first place). I'm reconsidering my purchase at the moment. I kinda wish I could exchange back to dollars :(

what a dumb idea...  
  
wait a sec, is that one purple?  
  
purple is my favourite colour!

I figured it couldn't be that hard. And I don't really have no clue, I just have a lot less. Oh well, I still have the bitcoin on the paper wallet, I'll figure something out.
