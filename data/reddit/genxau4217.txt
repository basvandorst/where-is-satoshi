What a load of bullshit edit: you guys are seriously stupid if you believe that story, pure propaganda

How many full nodes are currently running? Do miners also run a full mode? Do full nodes actually help with the security of the network?
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:48:19
Can you explain that more?
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:40:28
That's confusing but thanks

Can you ELI5 the centralization issue?

But where will all the transactions be stored? They will need storage and Internet off chain as well.

I will say my 12yr old son has a core i7 with 16gb ram , 2TB hdd and 12MB/s internet connection. Would probably keep a node running for a few years... But I could be wrong

Can the block size not be increased exponentially 1,2,4,8,16,32... Yes it will get massive but where are the transactions stored if not in the block?

Because I'm a regular guy stuck in the middle of a civil war with a lot of money at stake and I'm trying to get some answers. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:02:06
But where are the transactions going? Who has a copy of them? They have to be stored somewhere?
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:56:03
Ok I get that, thanks
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:03:04
I don't see the need to run a full node. I didn't think it would help me or the network? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:28:37
More is less than or equal to greater than better?
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:14:48
I get that, are the inner workings of payment hubs worked out? Will they be a mini block chain in themselves? If I don't trust the hub how am i sure of the transaction, wouldn't a hub need the same building blocks as Bitcoin itself?
