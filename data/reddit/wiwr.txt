Lightning basically is a series of smart contracts on a second layer, solving the double spend problem for unconfirmed txns. I think what you want to ask is, "is there much work on *more* solutions to bring smart contracts to Bitcoin?"
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:50:22
I'm super excited about lightning every since I read the paper. Intend to run a node soon. But I'm fascinated by the idea, and more importantly how this idea ends up looking like in reality. I think the way the lightning network will develop is still an open question, but damn if it isn't a question I'm curious about.
The way I see it, Bitcoin solves the double spend problem for confirmed transactions using the blockchain with the added costs in efficiency for decentralization. Lightning basically solves the double spend problem for unconfirmed transacations using Bitcoin transactions ("smart contracts") with the added costs in timelocks for security.

Actually thinking about it, I want to rephrase what I said about sensitive backups. You don't have to sign your part of the commitment transactions until you want to broadcast them, so theoretically you can keep these backups anywhere (if privacy isn't a concern) while keeping your seed safe. You still don't want to accidentally sign and broadcast old CTs, but it's not _as_ sensitive as I made it out to be.
As far as I understand, there is no "built-in" expiration for channels. Since what you're actually doing is trading bitcoin transactions and deciding not to broadcast them because you know the payment channel can still be updated, expiration isn't built in, it's just closed when you close it. You could theoretically have someone broadcast it for you to make it "automatically expire" but I think that introduces lots of trust. Again, giving a third party the ability to broadcast (old) CTs is basically trusting them with your payment channel. Or you can have your own node broadcast them if the channel hasn't been updated in X days, basically automatically expiring stale channels. I'm not sure this is what you were hoping for though :)
I'm just reading through the whitepaper and it's pretty exciting. I think there are still lots of open questions about how the network will look, how will wallets look, and generally how useful lightning will be. E.g. I think right now you have to be online to receive lightning payments, and I don't know if that can be solved or if that will end up limiting use cases for lightning. The future will look different in each case :)

I'm pretty sure that when you have an open channel you pretty much need to back up each commitment transaction (each time the balance in the payment channel is updated) to have your own latest copy. Unfortunately if the counterparty doesn't cooperate, just keeping your original seed will not be enough. They can't steal funds of course, but you will need their signature to get them back. I may be wrong, but that is my understanding. If everyone is cooperative (which is to be expected for the most part) then I believe your seed would be enough, unless the counterparty also lost their backups. Of course, this is all only relevant for open channels.
I believe backups shouldn't be much of an issue, except that normally you would delete older commitment transactions because accidentally broadcasting them (which to the system looks like an attempt to swindle the counterparty) will lead to the counterparty being able to take your funds as penalty. So backups would need to be replaced, not just copied otherwise they may pose risk to your funds (you could say the counterparty has an interest in you "accidentally" broadcasting older commitment transactions). So they should be handled with extra care, I would expect wallets to experiment with several methods to deal with this.
Also, I really wouldn't use the term IOUs because there is no form of credit at any time during the life of a payment channel. You are trading native, signed bitcoin transactions that can be broadcasted and accepted by the network at any time with no counterparty risk (as per usual, barring human error).
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:13:20
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:12:05
Not an expert, just read the whitepaper, but I think you're right. My understanding is that redemption is done by broadcasting the latest commitment txn - basically, the last "state" of the channel, which has the fees determined in advance (because these are actual, native, signed bitcoin txns) - and that has an output which you must use within the timelock (so I'm pretty sure you end up paying two fees if I understood this part correctly). All this of course, is only relevant if there counterparty is uncooperative and you wish to close it on your own accord.
If the parties are cooperative (which I expect would be the vast majority of the time), you can simply sign a new single txn together that closes the channel with no extra hassle of timelocks or double fees.

"Don't make your coins depend on an external service" and "That's a point of centralization" are accusations that seem to be made out of ignorance rather than concern. GreenAddress offers a unique trustless multisig service which lets you balance how much control/service you want, while adding unique features. To be fair, if GreenAddress would disappear tomorrow it wouldn't be the *most* comfortable way to sweep your money to a new wallet, but it's still all *trustless*.
I'm just the knee-jerk reaction to all the knee-jerk reactions of "decentralization". I have no problem with Bitcoin Wallet and Breadwallet (they're awesome examples of modern, local and lean Bitcoin wallets), but if you're going to compare then do it right and don't say "truly decentralized" because even a local wallet can be a point of failure - software isn't perfect after all.

Off-topic, but...
Common rabbinical law states that using both electricity or money on shabbat is blasphemous, so using bitcoin on shabbat is an obvious no-no if you're into that stuff.
Regarding mining, that may be a little more complicated. Different people will tell you different things, but some orthodox folks would tell you that technically you can leave your TV on before shabbat begins and as long as you don't touch it until shabbat ends you're cool (should apply to mining rigs). Also, religious Jews use electricity that is powered by factories which operate on shabbat (though I think shabbat shifts are manned by non-Jews to make it more "okay"), so technically the electricity made by Israeli factories or anywhere for that matter shouldn't be allowed but electricity is given a free pass...

Excuse me, I don't code, but I find it hard to believe that "dozens of daily updates" is such an impressive number for one of (if not *the*) largest open source project in history (how big are these updates?). Gavin Andresen said it best: updating bitcoin is like fixing a plane mid-flight. The developers are admitting that development has halted, and everyone is feeling it. But ultimately it's a matter of taste. It may be that no more development is needed, some people are perfectly content with the current state of the bitcoin protocol/software.
I'm not judging or complaining, I think slowing development is healthy for bitcoin, it's user base is growing too quickly compared to how many resources are allocated to development. I'd love to be able to comfortably fund bitcoin development instead of finding dev addresses. I'm eagerly looking forward for the Lighthouse project to help fund development.

I would actually say that for the most security, simply print out a paper wallet from bitaddress.org and hold it offline (even with two copies).

My understanding is that the number of possible addresses (2^160) is on the order of magnitude of the number of atoms in the universe. It would be like saying that every time you create an address you pick a completely random atom out of the entire universe. If two people happen to pick the same atom they share a wallet, but the odds of that happening are quite very non-existent.

You may also argue that it is costing them negatively because of the price volatility.

Better chance is to break the randomness. Having the atoms-in-the-universe pool is nice, but if you keep picking the atoms from the same spot it would make it easier for someone to guess the same atom (still very hard but much easier). That's why the Random Number Generators (RNGs) are so important in bitcoin wallets - they must not accidentally keep picking atoms from the same area in the universe or else they'll make it easier to guess.

Blockstream then does something horrific like blacklist addresses (let us suppose they can because they are centralized).

This is standard (and arguably very good) security practice. If the attacker had the blueprints for the facility, he would have a much easier time breaking in.
I will point out that there are open source + bounty models but that's probably not the best strategy when securing more money than the bounty offers.

1) I have this guide I wrote in Hebrew, here's a google translation which works not bad...
Basically if your home computer cannot generate a vanity address feasibly, I suggest using this website ( which requires you to use your own private key (combined with a vanity miner's private key) and is as safe as your private key. You should understand private key security, because this particular guide does not regard security.
2) Not familiar with Armory, forgive me. However you will end up with a normal private key which can be imported like any other private key (and it has a normal public key which can be imported like any other public key).
Regarding multisig, theoretically it's possible to make vanity multisig addresses, however I'm not aware of any practical way to do a multisig vanity address.

I see no reason a sidechain would make it easier for him to attract core-devs and contrain them through clever contracts and financial incentives and enforce his own rules. In fact, manipulating bitcoin directly would save him the need to attract the majority of bitcoin's userbase.

You keep saying there's a problem with bitcoins moving to a sidechain. WTF is the problem with that? Because of *1-to-1 pegging* sidecoins are actually just bitcoins on a different chain. Why are they on another chain? Because on that chain, the sidecoins have different properties. Properties which are given to *bitcoins* that are simply on a different chain. Properties which people obviously want otherwise they wouldn't move their bitcoins.
If people want those properties and you don't allow sidechains on bitcoin, they will simply sell their bitcoins for an altcoin which does the same. And if you keep sticking your head in the sand and ignore innovation, your bitcoin investment will disappoint you in favor of a better currency.
Now explain what is the danger of allowing bitcoins to traverse chains.

Basically I'd like a brainwallet.org that I can use offline with the ability to:
- Generate HD wallet mnemonic seeds that I can write down and save a list of addresses derived from this seed
- Create transactions with this seed
That should be enough to make the current paper wallet model obsolete. I just need to run it once offline in a safe environment, write down the seed and save a list of as many addresses as I wish. When I want to thaw some money, I just load it again in a safe environment and after entering the seed be able to send it.
People who wish to keep each paper wallet cryptographically seperate can simply take only one address from each seed and generate as many seeds as they wish (writing them down is easy enough).

Counterparty is basically a separate blockchain with separate coins that is all encoded into the Bitcoin blockchain (therefore not strictly a classic altcoin). The advantage of doing this is that the XCP blockchain inherits all the security of Bitcoin's blockchain without having to invest anything in infrastructure (other than paying bitcoin fees, for the encoding). The disadvantage is that they are dependent on the Bitcoin blockchain (such as, 10 minute block time, etc.)
Since XCP has no mining, the coins cannot be generated by mining. So instead there was proof-of-burn, where anyone who could prove they burnt bitcoins during the specific period automagically starts off with XCP coins. It's like bitcoin has a new coinbase per block, XCP has one genesis coinbase and that's the fixed amount (I think there are around 600K coins).

The way I see it, the only way for bitcoin to stay relevent is to offer the infrastructure for faster-developing chains. You know, the way TCP/IP offers the infrastructure for faster-developing protocols on top. If you're expecting every great feature to be integrated back into the main blockchain, you're totally deluding yourself.

Yes, signature size is discussed. We can only hope that when we need better signature methods Lamport-like signatures will be improved. Reminds me of how Zerocash had the same issue and then in one press release announced the reduction of transaction signatures by 98%.
I don't see how address reuse will be an issue, my assumption is that by the time ECDSA is broken, any reused addresses are worthless anyway. It mostly solves the problem of "transaction malleability on steroids" (where the transaction can be resigned before confirmation).

Bitrated is an arbitration marketplace designed to offer trustless escrow (Paypal for Bitcoin). Except instead of Paypal anyone can be the escrow agent and determine their own fees. Bitrated uses 2-of-3 multisig to make the whole process trustless  (the escrow agent doesn't have control over the funds at any point). I offer arbitration services on Bitrated.
Onename offers a way to register a cryptographic identity on the blockchain, and use it in potentially very creative ways, such as logging into online accounts or using it for encrypted communications. I believe it uses a form of registration using Namecoin however I could be wrong. I think currently all you can do is identify yourself with metadata (like a bitcoin address or Facebook account). I'm not familiar with Bonafide.io but at first glance they look very similar to Onename.

I'm not asking for RBF to be implemented. I'm saying that it's likely that it will whether you like it or not. It's not really up to you and me, is it? That is, unless you have a significant share of hashing power...
Besides, you're looking at Bitcoin today as if it will not evolve. CPFP is a great example of why thinking that in the future we will wait 5-60 minutes in a store waiting for a confirmation is short-sighted. Things change, clever solutions are developed.
@_date: 2015-07-19 10:19:14
This is indeed a great analogy. But then complaining about RBF would be like complaining about black hats. They're exploiting the fact that people are using something in a way that wasn't intended / needs improvement.

I personally think RBF is a worry for much less than 20 years. Your trust in game theory includes some subjective measures, such as how much profit and/or loss for miners when implementing RBF. I personally really doubt that implementing RBF would significantly hurt Bitcoin, and if I were a miner, I'd be really tempted to implement it today.
This game theory isn't so clear cut.

Aren't solutions already being developed? (I'm thinking payment channels and green addresses and sidechains and probably lots more that I'm not familiar with)

@_date: 2015-09-08 12:37:08
If "users" is synonymous with "people holding bitcoins" then I would say no. People holding bitcoins are paying for this "subsidy" with a very high inflation rate of roughly 10% now. Such are the costs of decentralized systems - I think they're worth it because costs of centralized "trusted" systems are hidden and potentially a lot more expensive.

These arguments have been made by many companies in many industries. I too share the opinion that software patents need a reform, and patent troll suck. However, patent trolls usually get their patents from bankrupt companies trying to scrap cash by selling their patent portfolio - in other words, Coinbase are potentially building collateral for patent trolls as we speak. This whole situation sucks for everyone except for the trolls.
My limited understanding of patent law says that you don't need to apply for a patent to be protected from others suing you against them, because they can be invalidated by proving Prior Art. Why not just publish the patent application in public (thus making the "unpatentable") and *not* apply at the patent office? (For example, you cannot patent multisig technology today, because it already exists and is known)

I'm a big fan of these kinds of developments. I think platforms like Bitrated offer a very decentralized, very secure layer you may add to your bitcoin transactions to provide consumer protection. The design of the platform, of which I learned quite a bit about, is a bitcoiner's dream for making the bitcoin economy a safer place - decentralization, market driven competition, and multisig technology made super simple.
I am familiar with the developer locally and had the opportunity to drill them about all the trust and security details on several occasions. I've seen the platform a year ago and now after relaunch - I've got to say, I'm nothing but impressed!

I don't see any reason to ever purchase something with Bitcoins from a stranger you don't trust without arbitration. No more excuses!

Hi heniferlopez,
I get my wage in bitcoin. I do it out of principle and because I am bullish on bitcoin. I like to know that my income is dollar cost average and since it's in bitcoin my employer sends it to me in two week chunks as per my request (seeing as how easy it is with bitcoin). I consistently buy fiat because the vast majority of my expenses are in fiat, but since I live as humbly as I can (because I'm young and I can and this is the age to save and this is the age to be risk taking), I enjoy being exposed to the exchange rate. Given Bitcoin's exchange rate history (and my personal bullish views) it looks to me like a good bet. It's worth noting that I have started taking pay in bitcoin for about a year now, making me consistently lose on my investment. However I believe that for someone of my age who's just starting the life long journey of saving for retirement it is wise to be thinking of alternative stores of value to the traditional methods of the previous generation.

One of the game changing paradigms about this platform which I learned from his short talk at the Tel Aviv bitcoin conference: compared to PayPal's consumer protection which is managed entirely by PayPal employees with little to no expertise on the details of the trade, Bitrated arbitrators can be selected for based on their reputation, their expertise, and their crypto signatures.
Ever thought of using PayPal for consumer protection to buy code, or other intellectual works? Of course not, they wouldn't know what to do with a dispute on such a matter and would make for terrible arbitrators. But when you can use an intuitive multisig arbitration platform, you can choose/be an arbitrator according to your tailored needs.

You're not seeing a drop in absolute hashrate, you're seeing a drop in hashrate growth. The growth is at 0% so the actual hashrate is now not rising or falling.
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:09:18
There's a difference between block finding and confirmation times. You can find a block and not put any transactions in it, such that hashrate doesn't drop but you get longer confirmation times.

Difficulty adjusts to the last 2 weeks, there is no overshooting increasing difficulty (it usually undershoots). You would need an actual drop of hashrate to explain a drop in block finding.

Most Israelis buy bitcoin by exchanging to dollars and wiring to the large exchanges, or via the local exchanges which do the same for a fee. There is a great trading platform in Israel ( but liquidity is low and it's hard attracting the first customers.

I was confused too... They don't officially say this, but Qkos slipped in a stealthy update that reintroduced being able to pay. They don't mention this anywhere because they don't want Apple to be aware, but it's functional.

Roger Ver publicly offered a $10,000 (or the equivalent in bitcoin) bet that Bitcoin would outperform Gold, Silver, and the US stock market by 100X (!!! in two years. Nobody took the bet (!!!).
He updates us that he missed that bet by no more than 2 months - as in, bitcoin did outperform them by 100X but it took 26 months instead of 24. So he's donating 1,000 bitcoins (which was $10,000 two years ago) to FEE.org for losing a bet that nobody took. That's $1,000,000 today.

There isn't because Apple's policy doesn't allow it. The Blockchain.info app isn't "supposed" to be able to transmit transactions either (can't find source atm). Although QKOS have stated this is the case, I still haven't found an iPhone unable to transmit transactions...
Considering recent statistics estimating that iOS is selling on less than 20% of smartphones sold, it may be worth dropping iOS support in general when dealing with bitcoin (or for anything considering Apple's douchebaginess).
I'm not sure if the browser allows access to the camera, but if so it may be worth considering using the mobile site instead of the app (with the ability to scan QR codes). Otherwise, with a little less convenience to the user, perhaps using the mobile site + firstbits would be more practical.

This isn't solve time, this is confirmation time. Transactions aren't necessarily confirmed the moment a block comes along, it's up to the miner to put it in the block.

Just realize that it's a zero sum game. Bitcoin getting stronger is at the expense of other paper currencies - people are /selling/ their paper to /buy/ bitcoin.
Granted bitcoin isn't big enough yet to make a reasonable dent on the global scale, but if you watch bitcoin while holding paper, you are watching your wealth eroding.

More hashing power cannot explain longer confirmation times, if anything it makes longer confirmation times less likely...

From experience, teaching many many people about bitcoin who are new to it.
Do not talk about mining. It always brings up more questions than answers. If I have a stage (or in this case script), I won't even mention it. If someone asks how it works and they're not a techie, I simply say: "It's quite technical, but it works. Kind of like the internet. Do you know how the internet works? It's okay, you don't have to, but if you're interested here's where to go."
By not talking about the technical details, the skepticism of whether it can work or not is out the window (you'd be surprised how many newbies think they can poke holes in the mechanics of bitcoin). By comparing it to the internet, people instead can immediately begin imagining (with your help) how awesome it is to digitize things - this time we're digitizing money.
Keep comparing to the internet: you need a machine (comp/phone) and app (browser/wallet). People already went through this whole thing of familiarizing with abstract networks, harness that. "like the internet" should be a key phrase.
And remember: bitcoin is simply more competitive. It will win out whether you do well or not. This mentality should rub off in your video: people understand we live in a technologically advancing world, and bitcoin *IS* the future. That should make them feel either obligated or excited to learn about bitcoin.

Who said long term loans can't work? With inflationary currencies you have the exact same problem for the other side: nobody want to loan (buy) debt because it becomes less valuable over time.
There's a very simple solution to this problem: adjusting loans and respective interest over time according to an "objective" index to match inflation. With deflationary currencies you'd have an index that matches deflation. Every time someone takes a mortgage they do this.

I believe not, but go figure. If they decided it's okay for individuals and businesses to partake in the bitcoin economy, I would guess they wouldn't have a problem with the exchange that lets them do that. I wouldn't call it a financial institution because it offers no real financial services - only pairing between individual buyers and individual sellers.
There are no rules in this world. It is human beings running the show after all.
