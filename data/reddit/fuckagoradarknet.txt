That is a nice thing to do for people.  I've been gifting ten dollar wallets to young people for two years now that I meet at underground raves!  It truly gets their interest up and alerts them to the coming btc and blockchain changing world.

Uh, 200 dollars, why?

I could name many reasons, but right now I'd look toward Greece and what takes place there on January 1, 2016.

How do I buy one?  I'd install it here in Southern California....

It truly gets their interest up and alerts them to the coming btc and blockchain changing world. My new 2016 BTC project involves integrating EDM and BTC education focusing on Southern California youth.
The best thing this year for btc was seeing Bitcoin Jesus gain in popularity.

The Trace Mayer interview shows the man to be  condescending to people that buy tiny amounts of btc.  I was offended by his manor and would never use his Armory now that I saw the true feelings emerge from this man about the little people investors.

Gift them btc when they get a wallet at your choice of service.  That seems to work for me and noobs in btc quite well.

I gift anyone that will listen to me at least 10 bucks after they get a wallet.  That really does a great job of getting new people aware of btc.  I talk about it all the time.

Yes, they are for me now as well.
