So you're telling me a "professional futures trader" had no idea how to get into professional options trading and had to make a post on about it?
Jeez, that's sad
come on man, give me some figures. you must keep pretty detailed records
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:10:12
seriously though, this is probably a good time to get in. 
there are no guarantees, but if you believe in the technology it's hard to find reasons to not invest.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:43:39


Aka treat everything as an investment.
If you don’t treat things as an investment you don’t give a shit what the return will be.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:45:15
omg would you fuckers stop being so dramatic? Why the hell would coinbase want to kill the most popular crypto on the market? use your fucking brains for a second before you spew garbage. Coinbase is most successful when *all* cryptos are successful

there you go AGAIN treating a car as an investment. no one is buying a mercedes or lambo so they can sell it at max profit in 10 years
this is hilarious. we get it, you don't have enough money to spend bitcoin profits on expensive cars.

You're joking right?
 




YOU CARE ABOUT THE RETURN OF THE CAR. AKA YOU'RE VIEWING IT AS AN INVESTMENT.


SO WHY THE FUCK DO YOU CARE IF IT LOSES VALUE? YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WORD "INVESTMENT" MEANS. DO YOU CARE IF THE SANDWICH YOU BOUGHT FOR LUNCH LOSES VALUE TOO?
Are you seriously saying you're making comments just to complain that OP can afford nicer things than you?

him being ignorant doesn't mean bitcoin is going to suddenly lose value over night. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:19:16


No,  no it doesn’t. Because it’s not an investment.
Do you take into account the loss of value of a smartphone versus a flip phone?
A nice dinner out versus rice and beans at home?
I’m guessing not.
There is nothing wrong with buying an expensive car if you can afford it. Get over it

"All I have said is that I hope nobody is doing things like this if they still have pretty high debt to pay." LOL. No, you clearly said




If you can afford it there is absolutely no fucking difference. 
all your comments are literally just saying you don't understand how people can be okay with spending money on a car. and you go on to justify this by saying a car is a poor investment. lmao and you think i'm the 'daft' one.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:27:11
I think y'all are being a bit dramatic about coinbase. 
We can't expect every exchange to completely cut bcash out. This isn't negatively impacting the one true bitcoin. chicken littles. the sky isn't falling

I’m not the one calling a car an investment... you are.
Being worried about the value of a car in ten years means you’re treating a car as an investment. 
Comparing a car to a house means you’re treating a car as an investment.
If you can afford an expensive car and want to buy an expensive car, there is nothing wrong with getting an expensive car. It doesn’t fucking matter if it’s *only going to be worth 10% if it’s original value in X years*
BECAUSE ITS NOT AN INVESTMENT.

If he was willing to sell everything for a hundred bucks i don't think he was exactly "interested" in bitcoin. The way he phrased it definitely makes it seem like he was investing. 
If he said

This kid obviously isn't relying on those 50 bucks. It's most likely he has 100% expendable income. And yes you're right he shouldn't be putting 100% of his paycheck into investments.
He *is* making a wise decision by investing as much of it as he can, no matter the outcome (or potential outcome) of the investment.
Unless this 16 year old is living on his own telling him to invest in something that will likely cap at 5% returns is pointless. He might as well throw it in a piggy bank at that point.
Point is; he's 16, investing in bitcoin isn't going to ruin his life, it's all gravy
