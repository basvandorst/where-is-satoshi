@_date: 2014-02-28 05:03:37
Its entertainment.  Or for some a less depressing way to get the "news"
@_date: 2014-03-19 14:28:33

Exchanges will become more wholesale just like normal banking.

Dogecoin is gateway drug ;)

Paywalls suck.
@_date: 2014-03-29 12:06:22
I dont see how the irs is even going to enforce this at scale.  If I buy a burger I need to pay capital gains. If I tip 50 cents with tip bot. Its a capital gains event?  This is a nightmare and poinless.  It should be trrated like a curenty where you pay gains once per year not every transaction.

"Fair and balanced" ha ha your right this is such bullshit.  What % of time was focused on negative stuff? 
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:22:28
If this is for real.  It will be hard to doubt the legitimacy of crypto-currencies and I would speculate that its here to stay for sure. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 04:58:52
And it takes days to get to your bank
@_date: 2014-03-29 12:08:12
Nsa and the feds pr department probaly account for some of them

Bloomberg is a joke

Nice work keepin in Honest with real feedback.  :) 
@_date: 2014-03-19 14:31:58
Defiantly not much transparency or Admin area at all.  I guess we just wait for payouts to see.  
@_date: 2014-03-14 02:27:19
YES!  
@_date: 2014-03-14 05:00:07
They have to take a fee somewhere.  Much lower than banks
@_date: 2014-05-13 14:49:06
Angel.co has a good list.  
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:04:57
Did you even read or watch? He clearly was talking shit on big banks

Weird highly correlated with Nasdaq 100

Very little value its not what I expect from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) . The platform is run by GetSmarter a company based in south Africa.
I can’t endorse this class for anyone really. Especially if you have even even a basic understanding of Bitcoin , Blockchain Technology , Cryptocurrencies , or Open Source Software . Low quality content, and participants. Don’t waste your time on this class. You can get a better education on youtube, and reading blogs and forums.
@_date: 2016-07-28 01:10:35
This is the right attitude
@_date: 2016-07-22 10:54:07
Off topic. Belongs on /ethereum
@_date: 2016-07-22 10:53:21
As the price of Eth continued to rise.  Fools debate water under the bridge. 
@_date: 2016-07-28 01:12:09
And leaders like tour
@_date: 2016-07-22 10:58:54
Only articles critical of Eth allowed in /bitcoin.  Im bullish on both. Still don't understand the animosity towards the new kid Eth.

She has no clue about crypo.  She should stick to financial markets.
