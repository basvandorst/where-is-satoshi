I would recommend Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos.
You can read it for free here: [

Also if you want to understand more about our current monetary system this series is good:

Not if they use a different mining algorithm.

Buy a hardware wallet
Move bitcoins from exchange to wallet.
Write the seed(24 words) on paper.

Yes, then your bitcoins will be safe as long as you protect your seed.

The number of possible private keys are 2\^256, the probability of a collision is so extremely small that it's very hard for humans to comprehend it.

Only if we assume that the difficulty to mine a block is constant and that tx fees are constant.
@_date: 2019-09-24 08:21:16
I believe the nodes also check all transactions in the block, not only the block hash.

An integer representation is used in the tx, 8bytes.

It took me 5 days to sync to 20%.
Then I got impatient and used a faster PC for the rest.
So I'm guessing a full sync on the Pi will  take about a month.

I would recommend to do the initial sync on a faster PC, unless you are very patient.

You must first create an invoice with the amount you want to redeem.
lncli addinvoice --amt 1000
Then copy the invoice address.
Then send a private message to lntipbot with subject: withdraw
and message:
!withdraw [put_invoice_here]

When I did this, I connected the external HDD to my PC then synced the blockchain to it.
Then connected the external HDD to the Pi.
I'm not really sure if you can just copy the files files from PC to external HDD, maybe someone else know?
