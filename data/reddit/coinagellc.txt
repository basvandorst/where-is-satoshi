IMO I believe Geoffrey Moore in Crossing the Chasm has it correct. You and now myself have to remember just because BTC is all over the news and 'seems to be' in every paper or website, it's still in the early adopters stage. The move in 3-4 months of Wall Street means it "should" cross into mainstream. That said, Wall Street doesn't get involved to get an annualized return of 5%. :)
They speak in 5X 10X 50X.
IMO $5,000 in 2-3 years would not be a shock at all.

I wanted to answer this regarding the Austin TX video online. What transpired there was remarkable. Buying or selling from a Robocoin ATM is easy and for the most part, self explanatory, all except for the small little forgotten detail of including a miners fee when he sold the Bitcoin! 
Of course it's going to take 24 hours with that missing! 
A $600 transaction bites the dust because he neglected or wasn't experienced to know to include .40 cents!
It had nothing to do with the technology specifically Robocoin.
100% User Error.

lol thanks
When I bought my first BTC 8 months back it took 4 1/2 days, the atm takes 6 mins the first time and 20 seconds thereafter. And I hated getting my bank involved by linking my checking account. Those two 'sold' me.

Most buy $10-20 the first time. I would say 50% have come back after a week to 10 days and purchased more. (building trust).
My unit is at Hacker Dojo in Mtn. View,
Cash for start-up was in excess of $70k.

Red Tape IS complex. 
(Background I have written several state &amp;amp; federal grants, it helped)
Reading the 303 page BSA Act makes most people's eyes bleed by page 15 :)
It can be done. I'm here as proof.
Willing to help those that show a genuine interest and sincerity. It's my belief that those  involved business wise with BTC MUST build trust with the coming group of adopters to the technology. 
Chapter 1 of BTC is closed.
I'm fortunate to be involved in Chapter 2.

Each owner-operator sets his own fee structure. I usually set it between 2-4% with some unique changes. We do a Friday night 'Happy Hour' and charge 1%. Most everyone I have talked too, that's over 200 people in the last 3 weeks, understand that there's a price for doing business and they have been supportive.
