Do your self a favor and listen to Bitcoin sign guy on the tales from the crypt podcast.  Great episode.

I think Peter gets some deserved flak from bitcoiners, but he is a smart guy.  He shares many of the same ethos but his business is threatened and he doesn't want to do a 180.  Gold isn't so bad, he just is stubborn.

If FabolousCoin innovates some groundbreaking function that could truly threaten bitcoin, then we fork it in and carry on.

Preston is a boss.  Love his podcast.

Livera is a boss.  PlanB is a boss.

I love how Trace says he would never be so vain as to name something after himself.  He is always quick to explain it came from Preston.

Chico is hilarious, he honestly thinks the next bullrun will be fueled by defi...He also got rekted trading shitcoins.  Boo this man.

I would buy food and water for my fallout shelter but none of local stores take Bitcoin yet.  Is Coinbase compatible with the afterlife?

I'm starting a boating school for bitcoiners.  I need to replenish my stack after my accident.
@_date: 2019-08-10 13:37:41
Every sat stacked gives you more freedom.
@_date: 2019-10-15 00:48:20
When will they learn...

These guys rock.  Matt Odell is a good follow on twitter as well.

Dude just loves freedom.  Ohio should be proud.

In 10 years they will be saying they should have bought now as well.
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:38:07
I mean, you can DCA or lump sum and still be up...stack sats yo.
@_date: 2019-06-01 20:05:44
 Many of us think in terms of years or even decades.  You probably won't get good advice for such a short term sale because nobody really knows.
@_date: 2019-10-28 02:36:37
Rock on man.  There is a moment of realization that the price doesn't matter in the moment and time horizon becomes much more important.  Checking the price constantly is a bad habit IMO.  I still can't stop tweaking the layout of my citadel though.

Bitcoin is so stressful.  I'm always worried I don't have enough sats.  I stack for relief.
@_date: 2019-12-22 15:36:20
I buy the sats, and then I hodl them.
@_date: 2019-12-07 00:40:51
Are you sure?  I'm almost sure the average bitcoiner looks like [this](
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:05:13
I may not know much about it, but how long before I receive my actual Bitcoin after buying?  Do they send it in the mail?  When it showed my address it was just a bunch of letters and numbers not my home address at all.
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:01:29
Taleb is such a boss.  He saw the potential of bitcoin and is rich as fuck because of it.  He wrote the forward to "The Bitcoin Standard."
@_date: 2019-12-05 03:40:25
I think once other athletes see how Russell got so wealthy by owning bitcoin they are going to lose their minds.
@_date: 2019-12-28 17:38:51
I'm going to miss the current state of things.  Nobody gives a shit about bitcoin, nobody is texting me if they should buy, the media is silent.  It's a peaceful life, and a shame it will end.
@_date: 2019-12-28 18:01:23
This is the game theory at work.  There is a tipping point as the value of bitcoin accrues where countries are incentivised  to relax tax laws to attract the capital flight to their country.  Nations want wealth to reside on their soil.  Tick tock.
@_date: 2019-12-27 02:22:33
You're right, I'm pricing in the 2028 halving right now!

Every time I stack I get a tingly feeling downstairs.  Yeah, I'm in it for the tech.

Not a damn thing.  Family first, as long as my kids are in good schools I don't give a shit.  My low time preference is hardened to the point that material things mean nothing.
