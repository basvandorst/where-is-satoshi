Why not let the free market decide instead of boycotting anyone who doesn't agree with you. Sounds alot like fascism to me.

stop pushing bitcoin in the direction of digital gold. It is a PEER TO PEER ELECTRONIC CASH SYSTEM! It has become popular because it has been used as a cash system over the last 9 years. Just because bitcoin devs have been unable to scale doesn't mean you should re determine what bitcoin is.

Not a fan of 1c fees? Your right spending $5 for for a $30 transaction is what Bitcoin is about!

How come they couldn't keep it for 36 hours? Even if they can't those 36 hours could be quite damaging to Bitcoin.
