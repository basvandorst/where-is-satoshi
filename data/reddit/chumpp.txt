As much as I want to see mass adoption I have to remind myself that it will come. Right now people just putting money into it for savings is going to hit prices people never thought possible. Once scaling issues are solved it is going to be nuts and I am excited. 
I try to spend it when I can and actively look for opportunities. I am looking forward to getting a massage on monday for BTC and also help the masseuse learn to take BTC. I doubt she will want to use it for buying coffee but also I know that opportunity will come eventually.

Like Fanc1dan suggested it is good to set up an auto buy on coinbase. If you time it right you can get a good average for the week. There used to "always" be a weekend dip sunday night so I set up my weekly buy for early monday morning. I wake up monday morning and check my buy in price and am usually happy with it by the end of the week. The dollar cost averaging definitely helps especially if you use it as a savings account. I put money away every week and if a big purchase comes up I don't have a problem selling some BTC to cover it since the cost is less than how much I would have spent just having it sit in the bank. Then I buy more btc of course.

I personally think using bitcoin as a savings account will be the first major adoption of bitcoin for non investors. It is nice when you actually see the results of saving against shitty monetary policy. More and more people are seeing the value here. Hopefully you enjoy the ride.

I also paid for my wife's engagement ring years ago in bitcoin. I think it helped her understand my bitcoin obsession and has definitely helped with our relationship. She now understands it isn't just fake money like she thought it was when we first met. I also buy stuff on overstock with it which helps because I buy some btc every week like a savings account and cash out whenever we need to buy anything big. I always get those items at a discount as far as I am concerned. 
Also...some marriage advice...

I did this for my house just for fun. I don't think they took it serious since we had other funds but maybe it is what put us over the edge. All we did was sign a message with our address which proved we were in control of the funds of that address. Whether or not it helped I don't know.
The email looked like this:
Here is the proof I own the bitcoins at the following address. I attached a screenshot of the verification but have included all the information below for you to verify yourself:
My bitcoin address:
Signed message:
This message will prove that YOUR_NAME owns the bitcoin at the address YOUR_BITCOIN_ADDRESS_HERE and is able to use the bitcoin funds in it for the offer on the house at HOUSE_STREET_ADDRESS
Enter each part above into one of the verification sites (without the ...) to verify that I own that address. Only I can produce that signature because only I have the private key needed to get that value and have it sync correctly. This verification process just proves that I have the ability to spend the bitcoins in that account.

The point is the risk is assumed by the processor and not the merchant because they lock in the price and receive whatever currency they want and bitpay keeps the btc. Unless there is a huge dip between the time bitpay receives your btc and sells it on the market (pretty much instantly) then there is no risk as well.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:50:00
You could say the same thing about any currency out there. Your original point was that it was risky to accept bitcoin. It is not. There is no risk for tesla to accept it. Why do you care if the payment processor is taking on risk. Why do you think they charge a fee if not to cover that risk? Of course nothing is without risk, but bitcoin is literally no risk for tesla to accept so stop moving the goal posts. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:59:44
I don't think you get it. Bitcoin has value.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:29:34
It is locked in when you submit the order. Companies like overstock and steam have been doing this forever with bitpay. You pay bitcoin and the service takes the bitcoin and pays them the dollar amount. They have a processing fee which is much less than credit cards. There is literally no downside as a merchant to implement this over any other online payment system. Credit cards are actually more risky due to stolen cards requiring chargebacks. That takes time and money to resolve and bitcoin settles instantly as opposed to 90 days with credit cards.

It isn't a concern if someone spins up their own instance of a bitcoin fork. You could make your own bitcoin fork right now but you would be the only one using it. The problem comes from a significant portion of the network supporting a new one. If there is enough support with mining and being actively used then you have to deal with the conflicts of having 2 networks using the same protocols and all the confusion that comes with that. This is why hard forks should be avoided unless they have a massive amount of support (like 95%+). If there is a contentious fork then it is on the forker to change the protocol to avoid conflicts since legacy chain nodes will not necessarily upgrade. Anyone running bitcoin core v15.0 or above will not connect to 2x nodes which is how core plans on dealing with this. It guarantees a bit of safety for bitcoin if there are enough nodes ignoring 2x to have its own network and survive. Any older nodes won't know the difference between versions and that is where issues will come up. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:26:54
archides is wrong, they will interact with each other (to a degree) which is part of the problem. No replay protection means lost coins on both chains. Also people won't know which version of bitcoin is which if some exchanges treat the original chain as bitcoin and others 2x as bitcoin. If someone gives you an address for one version and you send the other, your money won't be received on the other chain. Basically the concept of a bitcoin will be ambiguous if 2 different protocols are calling their chain bitcoin.

The problem is they can regulate the last mile of conversion from bitcoin to fiat. Hopefully we can move away from that need sooner than later when people actually want to store bitcoin and do commerce with it exclusively. 
But yeah, they can't really ban or regulate math. People could still transfer btc to each other if they removed the ability to convert it to fiat. Might actually make them more valuable like other illegal goods.

I don't see Ether being used as a currency in the same way. Yes, they will have value, but I think since Ethereum is limitless it won't be able to be used as a store of value to the same degree as bitcoin. That isn't to say you can't buy ethereum and expect it to gain in value, just that bitcoin is better at being used as currency/store of value due to it's properties like immutability and security through simplicity. Definitely ethereum has some benefits that aren't available on bitcoin and there will be a market for those features but they will not be competing in the same space. [Here is a good talk about that.](
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:02:00
Nothing wrong with having competing currencies. The best ones will win. 
Technology in general isn't magic. There are rules and protocols that are followed. You won't be able to magically change bits and edit software all over the world unless you are building technology that allows for that. Sure you can change quantum bits on quantum computers listening for their qbit pair but my raspberry pi isn't going to interface with that. When that level of technology gets adopted, then there will be quantum cryptographic methods that will be able to keep the network going. You are just looking for impossible issues you shouldn't concern yourself with for decades. Buy bitcoin, and by the time these magical technologies come online to destroy the network you should be able to afford them.

In many of the videos (I think the engineering properties of money one goes over this a bit more) Andreas is very adamant about how Bitcoin is evolving. It can be both at the same time especially if we develop solutions to problems with regards to scaling, ease of use, security, etc. Bitcoin in 10 years will probably look very different than it looks today much like how the way we use the internet has changed. I think there are plenty of choices in the crypto space to be able to have niche currencies that are only stores of value or are meant to be used as a daily currency. There is nothing stopping Bitcoin from being both and I love that about Bitcoin. Gold is a store of value because it isn't easy to use as currency on a day to day basis. I think Bitcoin has shown that it can be used like that and I hope these upgrades/forks will allow for it to be even easier to use for simple purchases. That won't stop people from saving their keys for a rainy day. Bitcoin has all the best properties of money. I believe it will take a lot for another coin to scale and become as adopted barring some unforeseen huge development in another crypto. I hope more of them can scale and reach this level of adoption since more choices is always better.
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:15:59
Where is the disadvantage? You can buy bitcoin today, send it to someone and they can use it. If you spent $100 6 years ago you would have more bitcoin, but its no different than spending $100 worth of bitcoin today. Yes you have less bitcoin, but the value is still $100 right when you bought it and you would have to send it all to give someone $100. If you are smart and hold onto it then it might be worth $200 eventually or it might go to $0 if this whole thing turns out to be a failure. Either way it wouldn't matter if you had 1000 btc or .1 btc...you would gain/lose at the same rate as everyone else. How are you at a disadvantage because you don't have as much as someone else? If you want more then earn it by providing a service or whatever. 
There is no complicated math for the 21million number. It just halves the release rate until there is no more left. [It is a simple geometric series.](
Energy is the ultimate currency. If you think there isn't a unit of energy cost required for every dollar of GDP output then you are delusional.

What is money today?
When you realize this...you will understand that bitcoin has whatever value you assign to it. If you want to trade 10,000 btc for a pizza then bitcoin has a very low value. Right now people are willing to trade 1 bitcoin for any number of things (food, services, etc) which averages out to about $2500 for 1 bitcoin. One person might be willing to trade x bitcoin for something and another is willing to trade x+.1 btc for the same thing. It is whatever people are willing to trade for a bitcoin that you can measure the value of one. 
If you want to understand more about money and also some interesting history of money you should watch these videos. You would be surprised what things people are willing to trade for tangible/intangible items.

@_date: 2017-07-23 19:41:21
[answer to number 1](
This guy has tons of Q&amp;A videos you might want to watch. He also discusses your other questions in his talks but I remember them being answered in much longer videos. 
Number 2 it isn't distributed because early adopters took a risk and are being rewarded for the risk. If bitcoin went to 0 would you bail out all those long term holders? That is the risk they are willing to take and they benefit from it. Don't be a commie and get upset that others are able to take risks and make something for themselves. 
Number 3 nothing is stopping them from doing this. I personally think that is what BCC is going to end up being. Will probably have a lot of industrial/government support due to being in china. But as soon as you centralize any element you will have a trust issue. A centralized blockchain is no different than a centralized database at that point. 
Number 4 no one controls bitcoin. You should accept bitcoin because it is a way better form of money. More secure, anonymous, inflation resistant, store of value that can be instantly transferred to anyone in the world. 
Why do you associate equality with net worth? You have as much opportunity to participate in bitcoin as someone who has been here for years. Nothing is stopping you besides your fucked up sense of fairness. Just because you aren't getting the same amount as everyone else doesn't mean you won't be better off...

Quantum computers aren't magical devices that can change code on millions of machines that all say no more than 21million coins will ever be released. I don't understand why you can't grasp that. Just like if I wrote a program that said print hello 10x you couldn't magically make that program start printing more unless you physically modified it. It wouldn't be the same version and if it was a bitcoin program it would be rejected by the bitcoin network. 
As soon as you can capture raw "energy" (whatever you want to quantify that as) you can start your own monetary system. Right now we have that with oil markets and other futures markets. You tie that to a dollar value and you can trade dollars or the energy unit itself like barrels of oil. I don't understand your hang up on why the energy used to create something should also be the currency for the good itself. Will you pay a farmer for his crops by giving him oil for his tractor, electricity for operating the automatic systems, cattle feed for feeding animals helping work the land, etc... Or just give him something he deems worthy of trading all that investment/cost input? And yes, energy will be used to make more bitcoin just like energy is used to make everything.
If 8 billion people can't be convinced to use bitcoin then that isn't the bitcoin community's problem. Hopefully some of the people that are suffering with traditional debt based money systems will be convinced once they see what is possible with bitcoin. The community itself is trying to explain these things and build useful tools to make the adoption easier.

If there is a technical breakthrough in encryption/decryption then the algorithms will have to be adjusted. This type of thing doesn't happen instantly as there are research papers printed and such before any technical implementation is ever made. It isn't like suddenly someone will be able to crack it and if they do the network would quickly adjust to handle it. He mentions government attempting to do this in secret but as soon as someone attacks the network with it there will be an adjustment in the code to prevent it. It wouldn't be worth it trying to attack the network if you had that kind of secret ability. You would want to be more stealthy and go after more profitable systems like another government.
Bitcoin doesn't really have an energy representation. One of his talks he mentions about how bitcoin "wastes" electricity. That isn't correct. It uses electricity since that is a fixed cost to mine and can be calculated based on hashes and cpu quality and all that. This is why the proof of work is setup how it is. Anyone should be able to know that once a hash has been found there was a base cost tied to the difficulty. If one of the miners tries to cheat by mining wrong blocks or not following consensus rules there is a real world cost to this. It keeps miners in line because if they don't follow the rules they are just wasting money mining blocks that will be rejected. If everyone had a private nuclear reactor like the sun the costs would be lower but the idea would still be the same. You have to do a set amount of work to get a result and that cost incurred should correlate to the value of a bitcoin but it isn't constant. 
Bitcoin is a digital currency and it is completely neutral. If someone doesn't want it then they don't have to use it. Ideally people would want to use it because it has all the best [properties of money.]( People use new technologies to improve their lives and bitcoin is a better form of money. I don't use Venezuelan Bolivars because they are shit and inflation is going crazy. People all over the world will accept USD because it is the reserve currency and they can trade it everywhere. It also helps that the USA will come destroy your country if you refuse to accept if for oil. Once people start waking up to situations like the [coming currency wars]( they may start accepting bitcoin more. It is reasonable to try to avoid inflation that is inherent in fiat currency. People also might be using it before they realize they are using it. Payment systems can be built on top while people are adopting the new tech. Much like you don't have to understand how http works to browse the internet, hopefully in the future you won't have to understand how bitcoin works to be able to use it easily. 
Bitcoin isn't a fiat currency. There is a max amount that will ever exist and no central authority can print more or devalue it. They also can't steal it out of your wallet or prevent you from sending it to anyone you want. It has the value of whatever people assign to it and not what some government says it is worth. Compare that to fiat which goes down in value every day due to money printing and debt. 
I don't understand what you are trying to say about bitcoin and planet earth. You could ask the same question about gold or bananas since those have also been used as currency before. There is just a set limit of bitcoin and as long as someone wants them they will have value. What that value is is up to the people involved in the transaction. There is no need to bring threats of violence and use of force from a government to give them value. That is what separates it from our debt based money today.

I have not had any problems with coinbase. I tried to leave a positive review the other day but it got downvoted. Just make sure all your verification stuff is in order and you are fine. 
I have 2 level2 accounts on their site and both have been great for buying/selling. I sold $25k worth of bitcoins before thanksgiving and it went through just fine. They sent the money this monday and I got it tuesday. 
I was able to buy today during the (hopefully) dip and they credited my account 10 btc instantly. If you resolve your verification problems then everything is smooth sailing afterwards. 
That doesn't make your issues any less valid. 
-I don't know why you are having issues with verifications for your credit card. 
-Also the limit on buying more after the first transaction really should be stated. 
-They should be able to be contacted although I have had no need to do so. 
-And as others have said they are not an exchange so don't try to buy/sell quickly there. They don't have an account for you to hold $ after you withdraw. It is all done with bank transfers which take forever. 
Coinbase has a purpose and it isn't a site you use for making quick trades and exchanges. It is a secure way to get in and out of btc if you are patient, though. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:21:16
They are usually very fast responding if you are verified. I wish I knew how to get you verified sooner. I think it is stupid you can't order more than once during the verification process but that is what you have to deal with when using bitcoin due to its nature. They are also getting slammed right now due to the dip so they probably aren't making verifications and issues with that a top priority.
