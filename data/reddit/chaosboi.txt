Wow, surely these will loose. Could easily be $20k by end of the week!

Thanks for awesome reply. Btw- I'm currently using paper wallets. Feels more comfortable. And blockchain to 'watch' the public address.

So to clarify, if I have 1 BTC before the fork and then after the hard fork can I withdraw on both chains, as I assume they won't be 'talking' to each other?

Breadwallet doesn't track the balance of paper wallets :-(

Coinjar in Australia have just sent an email saying " CoinJar is expecting to place a temporary pause on all trading activities and wallet services in order to ensure customer funds are protected."

Finally made it to the destination wallet 5 hours later...now it's been pending in there for more than 30 minutes.

Thanks for the clear answers. I tried to google it, but the only answers I could find didn't sum it up as easily as above.

I'm guessing then apps like breadwallet don't store anything on their servers, so safe similar to paper?
