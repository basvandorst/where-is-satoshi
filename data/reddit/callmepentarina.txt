Is it possible to run a half node?

Thanks I will keep that in mind!
But now I will read into that topic.

ow okay then it seems better to just keep the blockchain and dont prune it.

Is it 16 mb rn?

With my internet connection it would be annoying to download the whole blockchain.
How many gb would be a pruned blockchain?
And I have read that you have to follow the KYC guidelines. Does it apply to me since im living in Germany?

Well if its sufficent then its great!
How can I download the initial block?
Didnt know that we were the 2nd place tho! I thought it wouldn´t be efficient because of the high power costs.

With 32 mb it would be terabyte size!

I have a pretty decent PC ( Ryzen 5 1600x - RTX 2070 - Windows 10) could I run the Node just next to other Programs or cant I run any programs? And do I need linux ? Im thinking about creating a node . Its awesome to be part of such a thing!
Thanks for the tip again haha
