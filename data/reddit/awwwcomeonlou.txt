I wonder if social transparency through a digital currency that can not be anonymous would help to eliminate robbery, anonymous bribery, corruption, slush funds, embezzlement, black op funds, organized crime, etc......

Your response is light hearted and very welcome on this holiday, but there is an underlying serious assumption:
The idea that losing privacy is akin to slavery and therefore needs to be fought against.
Does it have to  be that way?
If a crypto currency listed the owner of the currency, and all the previous owners back to the day it was mined.  If they were listed as individuals not as an IP address that can be hidden behind anonymous TOR technology.  Then no one could hide.  No back room shady deal, no bribes, no robbery etc....
Is that slavery or is it freedom?

"Global governments seem to be fascinated with tracking individuals, profiling their habits, identifying patterns."


Why try to fight it.  You are an individual and government trends of tracking citizens and increasing social transparency is like a moving train.  You can't stop a train and I'm not interested in joining you so that we can try together.  
I like this trend; the dissolution of barriers and the permeation of technology into our individual lives, because it carries with it the slow elimination of secrecy.  It is in the world of secrets that the real dark shit  happens.  If the global adoption of a digital currency, with 100% transparency, eliminates 90% of the secrets then the world is better off.
I can live with no privacy if it is fairly distributed.
Can you?

Terrance McKenna was an psychonaut, (an explorer of the unconscious unknown realms through the use of psychedelic drugs)  
He often spoke on the subject of technology linking us together and breaking down barriers.
Those of you who want bitcoin to become a 100% anonymous currency will not find much to connect to in his talks.

Don't forget the Peak Oil crowd, they are similar.

I hope so, but the question still stands:
"How can the tainted perception of bitcoin as a criminal anonymous currency, be dealt with?"

I've heard of TM from pervious experience, so I commented from that...
Was it bad?

Nice, 
Huge potential 
Now let's get this set up in a good game.
Considering the gaming industry is a multi billion dollar a year business, this could be game changing for Bitcoin
