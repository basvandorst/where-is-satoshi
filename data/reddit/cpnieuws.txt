Another cool idea is to save different revisions of the map so you can see the world turn green over time, make a timeline and go back and forth.

"virtual" :/

I think it's worrisome that you think it's funny. This hurts the adoption of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 18:24:55
Yeah that's what I found interesting as well. If the intention of this  'investigation' was to show how bitcoin could make this transaction untraceable and poses a threat because of its anonymity, it has utterly failed.

Rendering any criticism invalid? 
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:15:23
Many people still download the QT wallet.
But this is not actually what I meant. Bitcoin's reputation with the general public is already fairly bad and any mention of 'viruses' and 'bitcoin' in the same sentence will just fuel uninformed people's distrust of bitcoin.

Yes, it is the same, except that picture is a computer rendering haha

How can you confirm it's legit?
@_date: 2011-10-10 14:11:40
YAH. It's seriously. Fascinating!

Definitely Dutch. It's the way he says "the Internet"

Right now, you can't, unfortunately. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 18:01:02
Damn dude, you're right! We're way too gullible.

The video and the article obviously don't tell us anything new. This is a quick translation I did of the article (prepare yourself for lots of typos):
**What are Bitcoins?**
Bitcoin is a virtual currency, which you can buy using real money. This sounds special, but it really isn't. If you buy a gift card, or coins at the fair ground, you do pretty much the same. The difference is who supplies the money. Bitcoin isn't the shop keeper or the boss of the fair ground. It isn't a bank or goverment either. It's the participants of Bitcoin itself that manage the currency.
The big advantage is that the currency can be exchanged between the participants without a middle man. And in a period in which people are losing confidence in banks and governments, Bitcoin seems, to some, as an attractive alternative.
**Who is the boss/founder of Bitcoin?**
The Japanese programmer Satoshi Nakamoto has invented Bitcoin, but who he is, or if he even exists, is unclear. He came up with the following concept: not the banks, but the computers of all participants should manage the system and approve transactions. Using these ideas as a starting point, programmers worldwide have begun working on these ideas, and they have created programs to make them happen. These programs are open source, so everyone can contribute.
The system uses heavy cryptography to prevent a too easy way of creating new coins. And: there is a maximum amount of Bitcoins that kan be issued. Thus, scarce is inherent to the system. Some analysts, amongst others analysts from the European Central Bank, have therefore compared Bitcoins to gold.
**Where do the coins come from?**
The coins are calculated. This is called mining. The algorithm used by Bitcoin ensures that when more Bitcoins are created, more computing power is needed to create more. People who help calculate are rewarded by receiving Bitcoins. However, the demand has recently been so high, and the difficulty of the calculations has been so high, that it's now only profitable to mine Bitcoins using special computers. Some are building these on their own and new companies are established every day that sell Bitcoins.
**How do I get Bitcoins?**
There exist numerous markets for the buying and selling of Bitcoins in euro's or dollars. The best known is Mt. Gox in the US. Meanwhile, the trade of Bitcoins has been very active. There´s even a waiting list for newcomers. In The Netherlands, Bitcoisn can be bought at Bitbank or Bitonic.nl [&amp;lt;-- Bitbank actually just links to Bitonic] using iDEAL [&amp;lt;-- the most widely used method of online payment in The Netherlands. You log into your bank account and iDEAL handles the transaction]. The price is less advantageous than in the US. Bitcoins are saved in a digital wallet. It can be stored on your own computer or in the cloud. Read more at Bitcoin.org.
**What's the risk?**
The exchange rate of Bitcoin is very unstable. There is no protection from a digital (stock) exchange crash. Critics argue that there is a gold fever going on, again comparing Bitcoins to gold. Some say that this can only lead to a crash.
In the meantime, more and more governments are asking themselves how to go about dealing with Bitcoin. More regulations are in the vicinity. Finally: hackers. They've already been able to steal hundreds of thousands.

There's always volatility and risk.

Greedy hands? We'd all like some cheap coins, wouldn't we?
