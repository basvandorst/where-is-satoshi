There has been delays in discovered blocks today. Nothing to see here. I sent coins a couple of hours ago and they have since confirmed.  Give it some time.

So you want to transfer USD? In any case, the purchase will be instantaneous. You can do an ACH transfer with your bank which converts directly to bitcoin. You can also use debit and creeit card. It is more of a purchase than a transfer
Coinbase also has gdax.com which allows you to buy with a 0.25% fee. So if it is substantial, gdax is definitely an option.
Regardless of the method, make the purchase and immediately move your coins to a private wallet.
@_date: 2017-02-05 17:20:19
For things like openbazaar, it would be in your best interest to have a private wallet to accept payments. I prefer core or electrum personally.
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:04:20
These comments are frustrating. Bitcoin is still in the early phase of deployent. A decentralized network that stores transctions will not be perfect. Any newcomer should educate themselve swith how the system fuctions. They can make an educated decision as to whether they want ro participate or not. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 20:13:54
Yes, they stopped public btc services. From what i have heard, they are still using bitcoin to allow for international transfer of fiat.
@_date: 2017-02-24 18:17:35
You transfer when you receive it. There are multiple payment methods. Debit/credit card are instant, but incur a slightly highet fee. A bank account, or ach transfer, will offer a lower fee but can take a few days to receive your btc.

It highlights the strict regulations that are goin to be instituted by the Japanese government. Basically a tougher bitlicense than New York. $300,000-$500,000 initial cost plus regulatory fees to stay compliant. Overall it states that these adoptions should be watched with a wary eye.

No, Japan does not treat bitcoin as an asset. Therefore there will be no capital gains tax. They are considering it a form of currency, so they may include the standard sales tax that is added to purchases. 8-10%

No problem! Restriction is weird, but yeah they start you off with smaller purchases. As you continue to buy btc, they increase your buy limits.
@_date: 2017-02-27 19:22:23
Nobody knows. Just watch for news outlets and infomration as it comes in.
@_date: 2017-02-23 04:57:10
Tumblers will sometimes take 3 confirmations before the coins show up.
@_date: 2017-02-23 05:27:00
Watch blockchain.info for the mined blocks. You can get an idea of how many confirmations have occured. You can also input the transaction id to find out.
@_date: 2017-02-22 03:03:48
Mmmmm "byte-size"

I inquires at a local Stater Bros. supermakrket if they would accept bitcoin.  I received a rather puzzled look. I was then told that I would have to put my request in with a manager.  Worth a shot!

Simply bring a laptop or computer with you. Download bitcoin core. As it syncs withthe network, the blockchain will download to tht system. You can then copy it to another location such as a node.  It may be a bit faster, but cpu and memory can also bottleneck the bandwidth.
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:31:44
As i tell others, it is usually always a good time to buy. Discounts are great as the price has historically increased from its record lows.

Volatility is what got me to buy more btc. The threshold of price will adjust to allow buyers/sellers to move at a price they are comfortable with.
@_date: 2017-02-22 03:01:42
I wouldn't think so.  It still seems to use the old channels of moving funds.  This will come with fees, restrictions, and control. 
With fees there will have to be an emphasis on how much of the funds are being sent. I am sure this will be on a percentage basis. 
Restrictions are pretty obvious.  It seems to be that the channels are geared toward the United States and European countries. I dont see this acclimating with third world countries where fraud is prevalent. 
The control will be in the hands of the company who oversees and processes these transactions. This creates an issue with anonymity, fraud, control of funds, and bad apples. 
Bitcoin eliminates these inherent problems that I am sure will plague this service. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:53:59
I think the biggest issue is node centralization. The blockchain file size would grow exponentially. To the point where average users can no longer maintain them. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 01:49:38

I hate to disagree, i think the lunch was indeed worth it regardless of the fee. I think it is absolutely fantastic to buy lunch with btc. Not to mention the profits you may have possibly made by holding which would make the fee null comparatively. I am jealous! If i missed it, what did you order?
@_date: 2017-03-03 22:28:09
This is due to paging. The CPU is offloading the stress to the memory to ease the load on it.
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:22:42
There isn't really a fee cap. The fee cap would be psychological. Basically, that will be when the majority is no longer trying to outdo others fees to get into the next block. Its much like an auction in the respect. Priority will be given to the highest bidder. I personally feel that we will soon be approaching that psychological cap. The fees are purely market driven, almost seperately from the bitcoin market itself which is an interesting concept.
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:08:48

@_date: 2017-03-09 20:15:09
As stated, you will need the wallet.dat file. Your private key is saved in this file, and the key is usually unknown by the user. Since there was no seed, you will have to search for this file specifically if you wish to recover your funds. Proof of transactions will not help.

If you are evading taxes or using the money/btc for illicit purposes. Do not state your intent, and if you are worried about taxes, make sure to claim your gains. Keep it under 1k per day! Without sacrificing some personal information, you will be hard pressed to find a service to convert to usd.
@_date: 2017-03-22 21:30:29
Fees will always be a thing. Fortunately, fees do not fluctuate based on the wallet or exchange that you use.  The fee will be based on demand (+/- adjusted by you) regardless of what you use.  Coinbase is now charging fees to transfer, that is reason enough to use a more secure wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-16 03:05:24
I think coinbase is the only exchange that accepts credit card that i know of. I could be wrong.

For every 1mb increase, the data that nodes have to process will double. At the current rate, we are processing at about 144mb per day. 52gb a year. So to bring the blocksize to 2mb will double that. Exponential growth in data size.

We all have different expectations. I am in no rush to sell. Things have been optimistic since i got into bitcoin. Started buying at about $300 in small increments.
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:25:54
Fees have gone up due to adoption and a competitive market. The threshold will slowly rise as more and more people compete to have their transactions appear in the next block. As the price of bitcoin increases, the fee market shouldn't be a big deal. But yes, we are dealing with fees that float around $0.50. Its alot like trying to get tickets to a concert. The ticket you want is sold out, but you still want to attend, so you opt to pay a slightly higher price to guarantee that you will get your ticket.

No limit was set because any wallet/account would be allowed to hold any number of dollars, this is no different. Also, I don't think anybody expected the exponential growth of bitcoin in such a short time. 
As far as identifying which wallets contain the most coins, that ultimately doesn't matter. Even if you do identify one, you will not know who actually owns it. Let alone ones ability to mix the coins, transfer them to a different wallet, etc. Unless you are restarded and flaunt the fact that you are a whale... Then.. Well, you know..  Target on the head kind of thing. We unfortunately do have bitcoin whales that try to sell their point of views, but has it been effective?

The benefit has always been "low-fee." While you can send a transaction with no fee included, the chances are highly likely to never be included on the blockchain.  As the rewards for mining decrease, the incentive to continue mining will be in the transaction fees associated with the submitted block.

I've had paypal freeze my accounts, take funds from my account for what they deem as "non-verifiable" digital transactions. When i would provide proof of sale, they would not take even a second to verify that my evidence proves my case. Paypal are crooks and thieves. Those affected?  Legitimate small businesses and companies. Those who win? Fraudsters... paypal is bogus and down right crooks.  I am sure most of the profits taken in, are from frozen accounts in which the user cannot verify identity or proof of ownership of funds. Paypal, inded sucks.

Ahh, true. I had forgotten about actually checking the transaction first. As far as the rescan, i believe it processes automatically? Though I could be wrong so it may be a good idea to run -rescan anyways. Luckily i hadn't lost any coins when re-sending my zero fee transaction.  that would make me a very sad panda. 
As they say, always include the fee ;)
@_date: 2016-09-03 00:21:50
Run bitcoin-qt -zapwallettxes. Be sure to backup your wallet.dat.  it will take some time to rescan the blckchain.  When complete, be sure to remove the parameter prior to running bitcoin-qt again.  Oh, and increase the network fee prior to re-send. It will bump your original transaction and replace it with a new one.
