If the stress test had actually been organized or not, the indicative (normal verb form) would be right.  If someone is just imagining the possibility of organizing such a thing, subjunctive would work.  English used to use forms like "if I were you" or "if it be admitted that .."; those have mostly fallen out of use, but a few people remember them.
You can tell that the sentence isn't using the regular indicative mood because the verb *was organised* is in a form that looks like past, while referring to a hypothetical future course of action rather than uncertainty about whether someone had organized the test before the sentence was written.
