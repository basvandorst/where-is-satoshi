Simon, ETA for fiat reimbursement please.

Simon, thanks for the honest update! I cross fingers for you! Tell me if you need help in anything. I didn't get the status of the Commerzbank account. Is it closed? Did it accept wires from last week? Can they be reversed?

Simon, what is the current status of the money in your Commerzbank account? I wired you thousands of EUR and I am a bit troubled about the fate of this money. I would appreciate getting it back until you finish fixing all the technical and legal issues. If the authorities seize the accounts, it will take forever to get it back. 
I am a big supporter of bitcoin and your exchange, but I would like to hear a honest assessment of what is happening. You are saying that EUR and BTC are not lost, but I hold 10K EUR in your company and currently have no access to it, which makes me nervous. I'm refraining from taking legal measures for now, because I think it might only make things worse (but my patience is not infinite, and not replying to my emails is definitely trying it hard). 
When will we have more news?

And I want my 5000 EUR back. Simon, do you understand the legal and financial consequences of using your *personal* account instead of that entitled to BTC24 LTD?

Simon, I don't think I fully understand the situation. Do you have control over the Comerzbank account? When can I have my 5K EUR back? They were wired last week and disappeared into the void.
