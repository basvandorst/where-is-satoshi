Thanks! Either riding this to zero or until I can buy my groceries in BTC.

I got my friend to pay his half of dinner today with bitcoin. We are all responsible for introducing as many people as possible.

My life has much less stress since reaching a moderately well off position which absolutely contributes to my happiness.

So you could have bought more when you spend it. It’s relative to what you’re spending at the time.

Why come in and comment on something you have less than a clue about? Do you chime in on everything you’re clueless about or just when the mood hits and your soft dick gets a little chub?

Not if you lose more than 3% in crypto...

I’m shorting the US government, Facebook, and the sun. Eventually it all ends right?

Mine works at buttcoin. To Uranus!

There’s no spite, take it as a challenge. 
It’s no different than creating any currency, just people have to care and agree. Most people will not, this making our coin have no support, this no value.

Try it and see what happens. Then you’ll understand why you can’t.

Do you pay less if you don’t watch ESPN? No they just bundle it and make you buy shit you don’t want but you have no other choices.

For sure. What you don’t see in those numbers is that for a lifetime of that happiness it needs to eliminate the eventual worry/stress as well. Making 50k a year is great unless you haven’t saved properly for retirement then need to live like a pauper again later in life. 
I’d say there is a blissful ignorance to your future troubles around 50k-75k, beyond that if you live reasonably you should be able to easily fund the rest of your future spending (food, housing, etc)

I don’t believe so, I just fell in love with this project and want to find ways to support it.

Have fun with Comcast internet packages. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:29:35
It’s literally the opposite of this. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:31:59
Or they charge you to do it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:12:06
Is this a scam? I’m new, hence dumb. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:12:39
Why the hell did everyone tell me to use coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:34:54
How does the fee schedule work?
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:29:07
Not when the speeds are artificially lowered just to charge more. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:45:17
I’m sure that’s what some people said about water and electricity. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:11:23
Can you answer my question?
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:58:02
How exiting!
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:10:03
I do two things. Lurk and hold. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:43:47
Do you disagree with regulating utility companies?
