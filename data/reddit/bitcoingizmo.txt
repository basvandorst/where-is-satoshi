I want to get changetip down.
@_date: 2015-03-22 04:45:48
That would be terrible if i ruined my name and business due to the fact that I could not learn changetip on reddit. I thought I was doing it right but I guess not. I'll learn but I do have my system set up to issue refunds in bitcoins and I have done tons of exchanges through wallets but unfortunately not changetip.

Just opened up a changetip wallet and sending some your way once confirmed!

We are still a start up company working on approving our site and making it easy as pie to buy quality electronics across the globe. The main goal is to be able to ship to high risk fraud countries. Right now the office is ran out of our house and inventory is located at a different location within Colorado Springs. I was going to put the business address once we are able to move into the new location. As of right now we have a small team working hard on the project so we have to remain only email support for now but soon we will have a customer service line. Thank you for your input Andrekoster heres 1,000 bits @_date: 2015-03-22 04:26:52
You're absolutely right.. that's annoying. I'm going to get that fixed but that's going to take a little longer. It looks better in desktop mode but if you click the drop down menu it's really easy to navigate that way in mobile. Let me know if Im not doing the changetip right.

Thank you starfruit heres 2500 bits @_date: 2015-03-22 19:26:58
If you think about it... If the whole point of all of this work was to steal peoples BTCs I think I would make the website worldwide to increases my chances for more Bitcoins not just the United States. We are a legit Bitcoin Store. We just got a good shipment of thumb drives in and we are working on getting them on the store now.
