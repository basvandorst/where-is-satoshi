I totally agree that fiat will disappear and, in fact, it will be replaced with a digital currency, BUT this one won't be decentralized, nor unregulated and it certainly won't be Bitcoin!

Well, not exactly... I was basically pointing to all international shadow business ;)

I am not talking about such low profile stuff. You need to see the bigger picture here... It has never been easier to move dirty cash all around the globe. Let's be honest for once, Bitcoin simply provides the perfect tool for money laundry! Denying that is denying the real world.

No "high risk" here. People talking like that don't know for a fact... Assuming they are not just bashing Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 07:10:39
So not the usual FUD then, huh?

OMG OMG! BAN Bitcoin! Save the Children!

Bitfinex is a good start? Are you serious? That is probably the worst exchange I have ever been trading on. Huobi and OKcoin are waaaaay ahead in any aspect. Those are great exchanges! And they are dominating the entire BTC/LTC market for good reasons. Bitfinex? BTCe? Bitstamp? You name exchanges which are doomed to fail because of their constantly decreasing trading volume! LOLz.

Don't get me wrong. I am not just bashing. BTC-e has been my favorite exchange for a long time. But latest developments are not only worrying, but also a huge pain in Bitcoin's a**. It's simply dragging/slowing down the whole market. That can be proven by technically analyzing the different charts...

Well, I guess you never traded CFDs then!? That is what I call "high risk"! Compared to such leveraged financial instruments, Bitcoin is a very conservative investment :D
@_date: 2014-04-22 07:07:45
By the way, let's face reality. Bitcoin's future is Chinese. By now, approximately more than 90% of all coins are traded on Huobi and OKcoin. And they wanna go only one way... Straight to da mooooooon.

The main purpose of this post is to make people aware of the increasing risks connected with using BTC-e as a trading platform. It is dying... And that is very dangerous as we all know.
@_date: 2014-04-22 07:14:57
LOL. You must be kidding!?
@_date: 2014-04-22 07:43:30
It also can be a store of value as well as stable while not being widespread... And Bitcoin won't ever replace fiat. PERIOD!

Of course this is a reasonable comparison. It doesn't matter that the risk is caused by a leverage of 1:200 or even 1:500. It is a simple fact, that such "investment" tools are waaaaay more risky than trading Bitcoin! You need to put things in perspective...

IMFAO, this black and white pattern doesn't work for Bitcoin, since both expectations will most likely turn out to be false. While I have no doubt that BTC won't be a complete failure, the possibility of it becoming a wide-spread currency is waaaay more than questionable. So, it probably will be successful in a grey area. And this is exactly were it belongs...
