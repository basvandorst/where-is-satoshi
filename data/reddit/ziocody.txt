I'm a free market/Libertarian/Austrian economics journalist and I've interviewed McMorris. He's an engineer by day. May wanna dig around a little more before passing judgement

My interview didn't deal with banned substances. He was also not aware of his son's dealings. Please revisit the story

Journalism has lost its edge within the past few decades. PR jobs out number journalists by a factor of three to one. KTBS isn't a good source as they've fallen for the government's news release without actually looking at the case. I posted most of what's available in another comment. I encourage you to read a bit more if you are interested in Bitcoin and liberty.
