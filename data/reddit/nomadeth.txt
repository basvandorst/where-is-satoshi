So? Paying with cash instead of Bitcoin, is not comparable to using a boat instead of an airplane.  
And there was no streaming of movies at all at the time. Why would someone complain about something it doesn't exist yet?  
Look I think Bitcoin is the one of the best things that ever happened. But if people are defending it, I'd prefer them doing it appropriately. For people talking nonsense we already have Mr. Wonderful.

215 billion is the market cap, but not the amount of money invested. It is much less.
For instance yesterday the market cap was 233 billion. But 20 billion worth of bitcoin weren't sold. Not even close.

You wouldn't be walking around with thousands of dollars in cash.  
And if you have money in your bank, it's not that easy to make a big transaction. Your bank will contact you over a certain amount to check for security.

Will it get to a time in the future in which a bull run can't be stopped? When whales cannot manipulate anymore and the price  gets out of control? I hope so
@_date: 2019-07-07 00:25:47
There have been many scams like these that worked until they exit scam. Those, "send x and we'll send 2x in 24 hours" were popular back in the days. 
We all knew it was a scam but it was just a gamble. Be the last holding the hot potato. 
I participated and got 2x of a little sum. I thought it was calculated because it was still very new. But I was just being dumb, but was lucky... Then it kept going for a few more days until it exit scam.
  
This was several years ago, and i remember this guy who first got 2x of 1 Bitcoin, then of 2x of 2 and then all his greed struck him and third time he sent 35 bitcoin... 
I think at the time it was 1k USD.
He never saw those Bitcoins again
@_date: 2019-07-17 04:44:29
Yeah imagine in the near future the price climbs up really high. People would then know you have a lot of money.
@_date: 2019-07-11 02:16:38
If it's not 13k it would be 14k, 15k, etc.

Hmm, I was talking about there being a lot more buyers than sellers. That even if a whale tries to dump it wouldn't matter. I'm not talking about never selling.
@_date: 2019-07-20 12:28:06
People thought that at many price points... And keep thinking it
@_date: 2019-07-02 20:13:46
Time not passing fast enough
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:37:16
My point is. If a bull run is long enough, then whales would dump and see the price still going up. Hence losing their position. That would account for less whales.
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:19:21
You feeling like people are ruining your smart long term investment because they are causing this ups and downs?
Think of what you are saying. If you really cared about long term, this shouldn't matter to you.
Feels like you want Bitcoin to grow steadily non stop. And that's not gonna happen. It's a f**king rollercoaster
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:35:53
I think the government would eventually regulate this space if it became big enough. So that's no surprise. Now it's becoming big enough. But they also said they will allow it to go on. And that new technology is welcomed.

@_date: 2019-07-19 04:18:06
I think about it this way...  
It will reach 20k again. And if it's already 20k, do I  think it can go to 30? Yup. What when it reaches 30? Then 40, 50, is not so hard to imagine. At 50 it's easy to imagine it going to 100k and more.
@_date: 2019-07-25 00:05:28

All mighty Satoshi Nakamoto knew exactly what the price would be in the future. 1 USD = 1 Satoshi is not that useful because you can't divide it. So he set it so it becomes 1 USD = 100 sat. No more, no less

Oh good I got the same idea. Judging by other comments I thought nobody else did

Yes, why do you need to talk about it anyway?

@_date: 2019-08-13 13:23:14
My point is that Bitcoin can also swing by 20% in a day. So you are not safe getting out of the peso and moving into bitcoin. Also I trust the dollar as little as you do, but for the time being it will be more stable.

I’m worried about that too. I hope they can build on top of bitcoin, analogous to the layers in the internet protocols suite
@_date: 2019-08-01 02:21:40
There will be custodies like banks. It's more secure that way. Lots of people won't feel safe with thousands or millions at home. And if these banks accumulate a lot they invest it, just like banks and you make a profit on interest.

@_date: 2019-06-02 20:25:52
You disgust me
@_date: 2019-06-14 22:54:39
Hmm still I don't see the difference. You can't compare Banks to Bitcoin in that way. Because Banks are also an IOU as you said. For example I live in Argentina and we had instances in which the economic crisis was such that people started to withdraw all the money from Banks. So of course Banks don't have everybody's money, so the government dictated that no one was allowed to withdraw any money anymore. Lots of people lost their funds...
In 2008 that was about to happen in better countries than mine...
So you say you trust Banks. I don't. If they have your money there are many ways in which you can disallowed to access it. Of course it normally doesn't happen. As Banks are insured etc. But then one day it happens and you realized that the glorious convenience of having a bank was no different from crypto mantra "not your keys not your coins"
@_date: 2019-06-10 00:27:34

Sell off is coming then?
@_date: 2019-06-20 04:17:39
Why would I? They cannot cancel bitcoin, they can only make laws that may lower the price... We know this can happen and we are betting that it won't. It's a risk. If I lose I lose. In the end they cannot cancel Bitcoin... Bitcoin will go on, but at a lower price.
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:42:28
When you talk about making money is because you are selling? Because until you sell you don't have any profits

Think about it. It was once 20k. But at that time it collapsed and was accused of being a bubble. People thought it would die then. Now it's almost half what it was ath. Do you still think is a bubble? Do you think it can reach 20k again? If it does, do you think 50 is possible?
@_date: 2019-06-07 14:03:23

BTC doesn't need to replace gold. Gold, FIAT and BTC can coexist.   
It will be interesting to see what happens in the next economic crisis. Normally gold would rally as people use it as a store of value. But this time around it can happen that Bitcoin also rallies. Then normal people will see Bitcoin as the new digital gold.

Yeah.. it would have been nice to have it from the start. But the way I see it, lots of technologies that we use now are based on legacy code. And they have been worked around and patched over the years to adapt to new necessities. That’s because although new technologies could have been invented to replace them, those older tech had already been adopted by the masses

Why are you so sure things are not going to change? UI will change with time...
How old are you? When I first started using computers they had DOS, and it wasn't "easy" to use... Then we had visual interfaces but weren't that good. It took a long time for them to become what they are now.
But at the time many people thought that was it. That's as good as it gets.
With time Bitcoin and crypto should be on par and then even better than banks. It's new technology. Give it time. It will get better. It's just more difficult to do things that are decentralized. But there's lots of smart people in the world.

It doesn't need to get that high to be in the news I think. Probably around 12k everybody will be taking about it again.
@_date: 2019-05-16 04:34:10
Ah makes sense
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:12:42
Yup that's how it works
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:13:50
Maybe buy alts now. Since they haven't got up in value as much.
Honestly, I rather have mostly all of them disappear but for now they seem to always go up after bitcoin goes up.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:46:51
Yeah of course. I was commenting on the line about those currencies disappearing and the world not noticing.
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:33:53
First, nah.
Second, what if they talk down on bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-16 04:08:18
Hate that feeling :(

I'm Argentinian too

The 'what's the procedure?' line kills me every time xD
@_date: 2019-05-16 05:56:05
I don't remember how I got in
@_date: 2019-05-16 04:03:21
Coinmama is fine, I've used it because I couldn't use the big ones in my country.
If you can use another like Coinbase, bitfinex, bitstamp, etc, they have better rates. Coinmama is expensive, comparing to the others.

Do you mean that if I make a typo then the tx gets rejected?
@_date: 2019-05-09 06:22:28
Yes, I get nervous and check several times before sending any money.
@_date: 2019-05-16 17:15:41
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:31:11
Yes, I can buy like 19 bitcoins
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:38:41
Yes, Bitcoin is not as big as USD. But what you said about Bitcoin can be said about many currencies of small countries. Who knows? Maybe with the it will grow and become more comparable to USD

Watchout! Vegeta is arriving to earth in any moment

Localbitcoins, pay with cash

I'm looking forward to lots of "Thanos snaps fingers" memes when halving is upon us

@_date: 2019-05-16 17:17:00
Ask them to explain you why they think that. If you can't counter their arguments, then maybe you shouldn't be investing in Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:14:19
I get it. But a bank does a lot more than storing money.

Yay
