This is a setting determined by Wikimedia, not coinbase.  Coinbase just lets you decide if you want to request this info or not in their form builder.

How do I read this?

It all is based on when you click the buy and sell buttons.  Not when they get around yo processing it.  They make money on transaction %.  Not by fucking people over :)

This is the wrong argument, while the company has serious issues with handling this problem it is still uncommon to the point it is not worth considering. This is like the news Tesla got when catching fire. Blown completely out of proportion, except this time blown up because it was handled poorly as opposed to media trying to get viewers.

That is a pretty valid point too.

The United States is an Apple bubble, this fact is just not true.  Android is the far more common device developed for, just maybe not for American companies.

Apple was miles ahead in the number of apps offered a few years ago, the fact android is catching up means more apps are being released on Android, simple as that.
Also as far as quality, all platforms have crap apps but depending on what news you choose to believe Apple appears to have most of the useless ones.

This subreddit is not a coinbase support forum.  Contacting them is still the best bet.

I would rather see Apple learn from mistakes, better for everyone.

So what I gather is if the chart is curving up exponentially in the log, the value is going up far too fast to be sustainable and it will drop down to its support, which is more of a linear line over time. Or I made that up, dunno.

and what makes you say that?

You are not stuck in traffic, you are the traffic.
