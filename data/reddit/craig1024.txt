Since I learned to trade options, I love it when bitcoin goes sideways.  Profit.

in 100 AD an oz of gold would outfit one Roman legionary with armor a sword and shield.  Today an oz of gold will buy you a nice tailored suit.
Good store of value, but you'll never get rich holding gold.

So if you send btc to a company as payment for something, and that company is later busted on AML, all your exchange accounts can get locked up.  Wonderful.  
Bitcoin not having privacy on the base layer is coming back to haunt us.

Yeah.  But you also have to compile the open source wallet yourself, and you have to checksum the code, and you have to build an air-gapped machine to verify the checksum, and you have to do the same with your linux install.  And in the end, the NSA has hardware backdoors on every chip produced since the 1970's.
Security and anonymity are not binary, they are shades of grey.   Downloading a tor browser only hides you from some forms of surveillance.  The more time and effort you put into it, the more anon you can become.  But there is diminishing return, and you can never achieve 100%

They are not growing.  It's stock buybacks and deceptive accounting, like much of the equities markets.

The cost to mine does not directly affect price.  It only affects the choices made by the miners of when to sell.  It's miners selling that is part of supply.  
The only thing that affects price is the market buys and sells on exchanges.  There are millions of factors that go into the choices people make of when to buy or sell, but those are indirect.  
Price is set 100% by market orders placed on exchanges, and that's it.

A lotto ticket can be seen as an investment.  One with an expected return &lt; 1.0.  
 An investment is an asset or item acquired with the goal of generating income or appreciation.  Bitcoin certainly qualifies as that.  What you probably meant to say was that Bitcoin was not a "good" investment.  But that, of course, is disproved by even a cursory look at the ROI.
@_date: 2019-12-27 09:25:08
Stock Buybacks and fraudulent accounting.

The analogy was between my own experience of growing up and bitcoin.  Since my gender is male, it seemed appropriate.  
I'm sorry my lack of gender neutrality distracted you from what I was trying to express.

Think so?  I feel like putting 5-10% of your portfolio into crypto late in a bear market is a very low risk/reward ratio.

It could be...  shrug

Then my bet is you have not spent much time listening to him speak.  He's quite an extraordinary mind and has many ideas rooted in observable fact, honesty, and critical thinking.
Many people think so anyway, he's been doing speaking tours to 10's of thousands of people at a time, hundreds of thousands over the last couple years.  That is quite extraordinary in itself, name another intellectual who does that in the modern era?  Or ever...  He is, undoubtedly, becoming the most famous intellectual of our time.
I would suggest you take some time and listen to some of his presentations.  In particular he's own presentations, not interviews of him, or even dialogs with him.  Best to start by listening to what he has to say when he's speaking to a room full of people.

I have buy orders from 2800 to 2250.  The bottoms always have a big bounce.  We didn't have one of those at $3200 so I'm not convinced it's over.
I'm guessing April will be the bottom.
@_date: 2019-01-04 07:00:30
thx for this articulate response.  Sanity and rational thinking, weee.
@_date: 2019-01-04 07:08:17
The only people who hate him either haven't listened to him, or are having their own ideas exposed by what he says

Indeed, quite a resume already for such a young lad.

The question is not was he smart enough to get the call right, the question is did he learn anything from his mistake?  
Often people are very quick to dismiss anything that violates their pre-existing ideas about what's true.  The trick is to be both skeptical and open-minded at the same time.  "It's a scam" based on little information is very different from "I bet this is a scam, but I could be wrong".  
"I bet it's a scam, but I could be wrong, so let's learn a LOT more about it, because if it's NOT a scam, then it might be a huge opportunity".  That's where you want to be with your thinking.  Also, "I should trust in my Son more.  Because despite his lack of experience, he is intuitive, intelligent, and has the perspective of a young person, which can be very valuable.  
Anyway... you can constantly remind your dad that he fucked up that call if you want.  But I wouldn't.  He's more likely to actually learn from the lesson if you go at him with Love.  And also, it's a chance for you to learn to be careful.  You Dad is a hell of a lot more experienced than you, and that mistake he made is one that you will also make in your life.  So learn now the fact that most of what you think is true is probably incorrect and that you can continue to learn as much as you can for the rest of your life and you'll still be wrong about most things.    
Keep your beginner's mind, and don't let your Ego make you think you know it all because it's afraid to be wrong or to have to do the heavy lifting of learning about something that's complicated.

I'm not sure order books are going to tell you much.  Most liquidity is in the hands of bots who do not post to the book until they are triggered to do so.  Also exchanges are suspected of spoofing order book and volume data as well as wash trading.

an 8meg block does nothing to solve scale issues.  We need many orders of magnitude more tx per second for scale.  Watch the video though, Andreas explains better than I can.
@_date: 2018-12-16 13:49:03
No, you have to learn from many sources.  My point was that you have to actually play around with it.  Download the source, compile it, run it, experiment.  
@_date: 2018-12-30 22:09:35
The problem with increasing block size is that it will centralize mining \[edit: and validation\] due to the infrastructure requirements of producing and shipping very large blocks.  Scale must be solved at the 2nd layer to protect the decentralized nature of mining \[edit: and validation\] participation.  Andreas explains it in this video.

We are still in a bear market.  A correction this long and this deep takes a long time during it accumulation phase.  I expect the next bull run to begin perhaps 2020 or so.

You can't really learn this stuff on youtube.  You need a compiler and a lot of free time.  Youtube can get you started but you really have to do it yourself.  The information you are looking for is in github, not youtube.  Stay thirsty my friend, and good luck!
@_date: 2018-12-30 23:10:14
Yes you're right, simply validating blocks is an integral part of participation and must also be preserved.

The amount of money in futures is very small.  Their supporting evidence was "it happened in mortgages once too!".  Weaksauce position and argument.

adoption implies you can actually buy stuff with it.  Without adoption it's not money.
