Same guy tried to tell me things had been delivered in a day when it should take about a week.

This will be my first too! It's fairly close!

He's had so much time to hide those coins
@_date: 2015-08-15 16:01:27
Where should I take them? I guess what would you recommend as best/safest wallet service?

So I've had something similar happen to me. I sent some coins to localbitcoins to buy some giftcards and coinbase says I have 10 days to deactivate my account with localbitcoins because I was acting as a money transmitter. I've been trying to figure out if I've majorly screwed up legally and what to do... any advice would be appreciated. I don't have much money to see an attorney :/

How do you think the difference goes away?

as someone who got in on asic's back when they were in ancient preorders... it is profitable for me personally; however, I had to wait months in agonizing self and familial doubt. I mine because I wish to prevent any possibility of a corporation or government launching even a 25% attack.
edit: investing in bitcoin is more worth it until some new generation of mining equipment hits the scene in my opinion, so in my opinion your question is completely relevant. HAVE AN UPVOTE!

Riot and Blizzard would be nice. Amazon, but that's easy enough to work around.

I'd like to compliment you and Tom Carper on your profound respect and due diligence in your duties as senators. Please don't let the banks do any damage to an investment that China already desperately wants to dominate.

I think the idea is that without mining entitlements there will be absolutely no reason to continue mining after all blocks are discovered.

I tried reading it, but I have this thing about leaving garbage in the trash. Rand wrote two books, both shit. I've studied the book, and I know enough about it to understand that it is self-defeating. I'm not saying it wasn't important maybe in the growth of libertarianism, but utilitarianism and humanism have so much more potential in today's market.

Well, that was about 16 years before my birth, but I donate to homeless shelters, help with programs for building houses for the homeless, and tutor friends and family for free. It's cool that you're willing to mob a supreme court though, I'm sure that took a lot of balls and wasn't enjoyable at all. 
You clearly don't know anything about the political climate in the US.

The people (corporations, they're the same thing here in 'muhrica) that fund political campaigns and pay for propaganda. The Koch brothers were a great example til they got so heavy handed.

You say that now, but mining isn't predicted to end until 2140 or so from what I've heard. Now with bitcoin jumping 4000% this year while it's just reaching public ears imagine what it might do in the near future. As third world currencies collapse to debasement and natural disasters bitcoin will pick up all of this momentum. While difficulty detours miners the reality is that with price growing logarithmically also mining profitability should essentially scale with adoption. The chinese government has a miner being built, what makes you think someone won't want to leverage a new material/technology for the opportunity to take a slice of the bitcoin pie.

It's all a little complicated at first, but coinbase made it a lot easier for me personally.

Here's the real question. If it costs $1.7Bn USD to make bitcoin unstable is it worth it for anyone to destabilize the currency. Note that bitcoin could survive given certain conditions and a hard fork. The attack itself would make the currency worthless. Understand of course that these billions of dollars will be invested in SHA-256 mining equipment, which will be ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS unless a non-script (SHA-256) alt-coin survives the cryptocurrency shitstorm that would be the death of the almighty bitcoin.
TL;DR You can make more money mining with your 51% of the market than destabilizing the currency, we should be more concerned with 25% greedy mining attacks

What you're looking for is mining. There's a solid community at r/BitcoinMining. Miners run on SHA-256 protocol. I might forget something, but essentially miners
solve "blocks" (puzzles worth 25 btc) which is restricted bynetwork difficulty.
prevent double-spending by checking all transactions with the blockchain.
serve as a firewall against 25% (greed) or 51% (takeover) attempts.
Essentially no machine can do the proof for bitcoin more cheaply than a machine designed with no other purpose than proving bitcoins. 
edit: note that initiating a 25%/51% attack would most likely cause a hard fork in the network, making the attack worthless, the miners are merely a physical deterrent

What do you know about super-delegates, or the super-corrupt political system in the US? You act like I don't vote, but realistically you probably haven't ever tried to make a positive change in your community.

Before ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) miners bitcoins were "solved for" with a cpu. It became obvious that gpu's were faster and more power effective and the miners moved. Then FPGA's (imagine a RAID setup for gpu's instead of hdd's) became relevant and pushed most cpu's/gpu's to mine altcoins. 
ASIC's of any type are designed to only be capable of specific applications, (SHA-256 being the one bitcoin is concerned with) and therefore require less complicated architecture. This allows for more straightforward computing (referred to as "hash'ing" in this case) and lower power usage relative to productivity.
