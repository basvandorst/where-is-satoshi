Yeah, they were encrypted, but I'm assuming I have a compromised PC.

I think you are correct. After digging through some logs I now see that 3 weeks ago, I was logged into Dropbox from the Ukraine.  
Time to rest all my passwords, again...

It did it automatically, moved them to the new address under "internal" as the reference.

I understand some of those words!

Switched to blockchain.info online wallet. Hopefully more secure.

Vanilla, it was Dropbox i'm assuming, I never visit the Ukraine.

I had the private keys stored in a non-public folder. I have the Dropbox app installed on 4 PC's , all mine, that contain the info. 2 laptops, 1 work PC, and 1 Gaming / Home Office PC. No one has access to them but me.
I do have a corporate Teamviewer installed on all of them but the password is complex, I looked at the Teamviewer logs and no one but myself has connected to them, all the IP's I'm familiar with. 
My phone is rooted but I only run an Ad-Blocker software. Still baffled.
And no, 2FA isn't on my Dropbox, but it's soon to be.

I figured this would be a good place to post. Anyway, I received 2 transactions, one on the 11th and one today from some odd vanity addresses, 1 had the word "Enjoy" in it and the other "Sochi" for .00000001 BTC. 
I've not been dealing much in BTC lately but I noticed that this morning at close to 7:00am EST, my wallet sent it's entirety w/o be doing a thing.

Created my wallet back in January 2013 with the default Android wallet app. One of the updates forced you to change addresses when the flaw was found that made your keys less secure.
Yes, I've stored my wallet keys on dropbox, but only for a limited time, when I upgraded my phone.

Tell that to the dinosaurs.
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:09:10
Man, I love this idea. Too bad I missed the boat...
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:12:31
It wasn't much, but what did I do wrong? I've only had an Android wallet and changed my address when that one flaw was found. I dunno what's going on.

Had BTC and TLC codes for a long time. I honestly don't stream enough to get donations but I figured why not.
Edit: Added ChangeTip and made a panel explaining the process. I honestly did not know ChangeTip had came this far! Awesome!

No, it was actually something called Bitvisitor.

Free gold with Litecoin support! BTC-e can suck it with their crazy Russian error messages. Vircurex is still my go to site but the low volume sucks. 
I sincerely hope this takes off!
