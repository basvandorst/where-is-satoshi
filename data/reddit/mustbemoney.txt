Not in the next 24 hours, but I am worried on the long-term. Real interest rates have been negative for years, especially when you take into account taxation since most governments consider a 1% interest within a 2% inflation framework as an net income. And don't even get me started on the methodology used to measure inflation. 
There's no reliable way to protect savings right now that is not risk-free - I'm talking about 0% real return after taxation.  By setting the real interest rates several points below where they should naturally be, governments have been robbing me of my wealth for the last 11 years. This is very different from taxing income which is  ( somewhat ) more legitimate: governments have been taxing wealth through inflation for more than a decade. And for what ? So that powerful bankers can continue taking risks, chasing the profit while people like me pay the actual price.
I picked my poison, it is Bitcoin. You can stick with crony capitalism if you want, we'll see who does better in 30 years.

All the signs point to the opposite so far. Even if the EU or the US wanted to make it illegal, it's far from certain that they could. Government laws are still nominally subject to constitutional rights and there's a good case to be made that bitcoin transactions ( at least when used for lawful activities ) fall  under free speech.

Go and check r/bitstamp. Complaints are skyrocketing.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:29:44
You're referring to ring signatures which are not exactly mixing but the effect is close enough (  ). You can't tell where the coins came from, just like mixing, but the coins are not actually mixed.
The logic is that if everyone looks guilty, nobody is guilty. You can't realistically arrest everybody who ever used Monero, especially that usage is legal so far.
Monero uses 3 obfuscating features: stealth addresses ( the address to which the coins are sent is derived from your public address, but only you &amp; the sender can tell that the stealth address belong to you), confidential transactions ( amounts are hidden ) and ring signatures ( coins can come from any of N randomly chosen outputs, but only the spender can tell which output is being spent).
Monero has advantages compared to Bitcoin but has drawbacks as well ( huge transactions, the UTXO set is essentially the whole blockchain ). I like them both, they have different use cases so I think that they complete each other.

@_date: 2018-05-08 09:42:36
The network supports around 500,000 transactions per day. Post-segwit. That's 180 millions transactions per year.
You need 2/3 transactions to open / close a segwit channel ( depends if the closing is cooperative or not ).
So at most we could have 90 millions additional channels per year. There are 6 billions people in this world, excluding businesses, and not all on-chain transactions will be lightning related. Also, people will need more than one channel in practice.
Don't get me wrong, I am sure that LN will allow us to boost the network's capacity but the on-chain capacity needs to be increased at some point.

@_date: 2018-05-20 12:28:01
I disagree with Andreas on this one. BCH using the same PoW than BTC makes the hash rate volatile for both currencies. 
I don't think there is a role for BCH being the silver to Bitcoin's gold, especially in a post-lightning world. However if anybody should fill this (non-needed) role it should be LTC.
I like Andreas but he's trying to be a uniting figure a bit too much. Life is not like the movies and sometimes feuding brothers don't unite at the last second the fight their true enemy ( which in this specific case would would the People's Liberation front of Judea :). *

The network supports around 500,000 transactions per day. Post-segwit. That's 180 millions transactions per year.
You need 2/3 transactions to open / close a segwit channel ( depends if the closing is cooperative or not ).
So at most we could have 90 millions additional channels per year. There are 6 billions people in this world, excluding businesses, and not all on-chain transactions will be lightning related. Also, people will need more than one channel in practice.
Don't get me wrong, I am sure that LN will allow us to boost the network's capacity but the on-chain capacity needs to be increased at some point.

The community should be he one that decides where to take bitcoin, not the miners.
The problem is that there is no decentralized mechanism to consult the community, so the miners (as measured by hash power) are entrusted with the power to decide to fork or not - the assumption being that they will act in the best interest of the community. 
This assumption is not necessarily true and while each side claim to speak for the economic majority, nobody really knows what the people actually want since **there is no decentralized mechanism to consult the community**.

I always thought that 95% was too high, but 51% is too low as well. Tyranny of the majority is a real thing and the threshold should be high enough to avoid that - but low enough to be practical. It should be at least 75% IMO.
Also a 51% fork might result into two competing coins of equal strength. A high enough threshold might force the minority side to join the majority side.

They want the block size to be dynamic, i.e algorithm-decided. Each miner can dynamically resize the block (by a bit) based on a series of variable. So it's not just a matter of changing one arbitrary constant with another.
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:56:22
That was always a problem with PoW. All economic actors should have  a say: miners and users, instead of just miners. After all, without users the network's value is zero.

Agree, but an attack was always in the realm of possibilities - we just thought that it would come from a state actor, not from a member of the community.
Attacks were always a matter of when not if, thus defenses must be planned accordingly. Bitcoin is useless as a currency if it cannot survive an attack. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:20:05
My thoughts exactly. Even if I wanted larger blocks - and I do- I am still expecting to run properly written code.

@_date: 2017-03-17 13:28:52


It gives us room to breathe. Off-chain solutions need time to be deployed ( code &amp; infrastructure ), and the blocks are full **right now**.
The demand for more capacity is there today, and it is going to flow somewhere. If bitcoin can't supply, other coins will.
I am all for decentralization, but a short, one-time, block-size increase will not turn bitcoin into a totalitarian nightmare.
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:28:52

From a purely technical point of view, hard forks are cleaner - you don't have to support two 'versions' of the protocol. I am using the word version loosely here, because a soft fork doesn't constitute a new version strictly speaking. 
Aside from the merit of the feature being implemented, the problem with hard forks is the political message that it sends to the network. If hard forks can happen, you cannot be certain that a future hard fork won't inflate your currency by 10% yearly in the future.
Avoiding hard forks is both bad ( no improved features ) and good ( you know exactly how the protocol is going to be 10 years from now)

If we stay 1-2 years without increasing the transaction capacity, then a lot of users are going to move to alts. There's demand for transferring money outside the legacy banking system. If we can't fulfill it  those users will have to transact on some other alt.
We should increase the block size now (not unlimited size, but the network can probably handle 4 or 8 MB blocks ) + have segwit and lightning down the road.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:17:50
So what? Increase the block twice. There's so much demand for transactions that I am not sure that Segwit is enough. And lightning 6-more-weeks-TM is not ready.
Memory is cheap. And a basic internet connection can handle a 2 MB block every 10 minutes. I understand that having unlimited block is a bit extreme, but 2MB, is that really the end of the world ?
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:48:01
The problem with zcash is that shielded transactions take a huge amount of memory to compute ( not possible to perform them on a small device at this point ). And it's not applied by default, which mean that anybody using it will stand out.
To give a better example: if you're hiding a concealed gun under your jacket and everybody is wearing a jacket then you might get away with it. If you're hiding a concealed gun under your jacket and everybody is bare-chested, well other people cannot be certain that you're hiding something but it's definitely going to attract unwanted attention. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:35:38
I agree on a few points but LN isn't just for additional capacity. You need it for atomic swaps, instant transactions, microtransactions, payment channel with different properties than the main chain, and all kind of fun stuff.
Settling on the main chain could happen very occasionally ( under ideal assumptions) as people could buy coins directly on the payment channels.
I agree that disk space and bandwith are not real issues, even at 8MB but one issue you did not mention is the size of the UTXO, this could potentially become a problem.
The last problem are transaction fees. Blocks must eventually become fuller since the miner rewards are not going to last forever. Maybe not today but 4-6 years from now.

Thanks. It annoys me as hell whenever I see core developers debating their position by quoting Satoshi's words, because those words don't really support their position. But those words are less relevant today. Bitcoin is a social and a technical experiment, not a cult. Satoshi is a great engineer but he's also a flawed human being. He's not a messiah whose words must be followed to the letter, and he never claimed to be one.
I have tremendous respect for Satoshi, but we can't be limited to technical choices he made years ago. And we don't even know what Satoshi's opinions would be today. I acknowledge that the guy was a genius. I acknowledge that he built something great, something that was very robust. I also know that Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency so Satoshi had no prior experience to draw upon ( unlike alts who had the opportunity to learn from Bitcoin's mistake ). The fact that the network went so far with no hard-forks is a testament to his abilities. 
I am an engineer, I know that no system can be built perfectly from scratch and that includes Bitcoin. Did we pass laws to enshrine Edison's original light bulb? Did we decide that the Ford model T was the perfect car, to be manufactured till the end of times ? No. We took those flawed creations and improved them. Satoshi's creation had flaws as well ( p2pk, transaction malleability). That doesn't make him any less worthy of respect. So let us take Satoshi's vision and bring it to the next level.

I agree with you but the Bitcoin cash people could have waited for LN to be on production before rushing into a fork. 
We may need to increase the block size, even with LN, but where's the rush? Blocks are not really full if you exclude spam transactions with low fees and Segwit will provide additional transaction capacity, which gives us even more time. If we knew for sure that 1MB blocks were insufficient then it should be relatively easy to gain consensus for a block size increase. But we do not know what the optimal block size is right now.
@_date: 2017-08-31 00:07:24
I could produce a GB of spam transactions right now. Anybody can produce transactions at no cost. Mempool size as an indicator is flawed.
We should start looking at the mempool size excluding transaction with little or no fees ( less than 5 satoshis/byte).

It's not necessarily a short period.
If you lose 90% of the hashing power the difficulty will not readjust for 20 weeks (just throwing a random figure, but you get the point). There is no way to tell if a super-majority of miner will fork or not, but so far a large majority of miners are still indicating their intention to fork, and this prospect is worrisome.

He's right.
If we lose 91% of hasing power, we will have one block per 110 minutes, for 22 weeks. The mempool is going to be the biggest thing since the invention of fire.
A currency that you cannot use is useless. Think about it Bitcoin will be unusable for 22 weeks. Most non-ideological users &amp; businesses will migrate to whatever chain is convenient.

It's political not technical. It's about who controls Bitcoin.
The issue is the precedent, not the 2MB increase. Miners cannot be allowed to hard fork without the users' support. 2MB may be fine but if we accept the precedent, then we'll have 8/16/32MB blocks soon, and maybe eventually inflation.

Roger is right actually. Satoshi's Words are not 100% clear, but it is fair to say that Satoshi favored at least some on-chain scaling. He definitely alluded to bigger blocks and more powerful nodes.
So what? Bitcoin belongs to nobody, not even Satoshi. Maybe Satoshi did not know how to effectively scale off chain 6 years ago. There's no way to tell what his preference would be today. We don't want to end up like a religious cult that follows the words of a messiah thousands of years after his disappearance if we have better alternatives.
If Satoshi is against second level solutions, he can come back and voice his opinion. If Satoshi was perfect, we wouldn't have p2pk address and transaction malleability. We can't be limited by technical choices made years ago. **Satoshi was a genius**, but not a demiurge. Nobody can engineer a system perfectly from scratch, especially with no similar experiments to draw upon.

We have 50% extra capacity thanks to Segwit. We might survive losing some hashing power, but not 90%.

There's a saying 'never short a bubble' because you don't know when it's going to pop up - assuming Bitcoin is a bubble.

BCH might be closer to Satoshi's 2009 vision, but it doesn't mean that it's the most efficient way to scale. 
Every time a qualified majority is modifying / forking the rules it is fulfilling Satoshi's vision. Let me explain.
Satoshi has passed his creation to us - the people - and it belongs to us to decide where we want to take this experiment.  Satoshi's original vision taken narrowly is a p2p protocol governed by a narrow set of rules ( SHA256 PoW, xMB blocks etc...). However at its core Satoshi's vision is more than a narrow set of rules: it is a social experiment. The aim of this experiment is to prove that it is possible to build a network that is able to self-govern itself by consensus, and modify those rules by consensus. That is Satoshi's vision.

Core has the possibility to call for a referendum, which they have refused to do. That said, I think we should see how the LN works in practice before committing to hasty forks.

Empty blocks for example. They can randomly happen if a block was generated just after another block, or because of ASIC Boost. 
The latter case cannot happen anymore so it would be interesting to compare the frequency of empty blocks pre and post segwit, and break it down by miners.
There are other stuff that can be studied, but I am not expert enough.

Having a few centralized entity entities is just one possible scenario, and not the most probable one. It's possible that we end up with 10000 nodes instead of 100000, but if those nodes are spread accross multiple jurisdictions it will still be very difficult for a state actor to subvert Bitcoin.

I said it before: the need for second layers is not debatable. We can debate about the optimal block size, or if the segwit features should have been implemented as a hard fork.
However off-chain scaling is needed. This is not debatable.
I was disappointed that Jeff Garzik did not use the BCH hard fork opportunity to fix transaction malleability. He used to be one of the great, but now he just want to kill sidechains/second layers because his business is tracking users and deanonymizing the main chain.

It looks like they are going to embrace the concept of regular hard-forks. Many issues are easy to fix if you can implement backward incompatible changes.

At least core can claim that the protocol is not under their control.

Is this really an issue when the network targets 1 block per 10 minute given that we have dedicated infrastructure like FIBR ? Orphaning may be a problem for coins with very fast confirmation time, but Bitcoin has a large delay between blocks.

Exactly. The risk of double spending is low on small transactions. It's just not worth it. 
For large transactions, you can afford to pay half a dollar and wait for a few minutes.
 
@_date: 2016-11-07 10:40:18
It's on purpose. The larger the block, the higher the risk of an orphan block. And doesn't the hash right decreases with larger block ? 
I wish that other miners would collude and ignore empty blocks. If enough miners do this, empty-miners will start getting a lot of orphans.

Decentralization is an important concept but it's hard to quantify and measure. Because it's a social metric. And once you introduce social concepts into a technical debate things get... debatable.

As far as I am concerned, only real (post inflation &amp; tax) interest rates are relevant to me. The real rate on the USD is not very exciting, but it's still positive.
I've been buying 1-2 ounces of gold every year since I got my first job. I keep some of my net worth in bullion, so you could call me a gold enthusiast. That said gold is in the upper range of its historical value, adjusted for inflation. So I wouldn't go all in on precious metals right now.
Why people did not buy more gold one year ago, or even a few months ago is beyond me. Most people are only interested in an asset once its start bubbling, and by that time it's an investment to avoid. Don't binge on gold at the current prices. Instead buy 1,2, or 5 ounces of gold every year, depending on your income. On 30 years  you'll get a good average.

No way to tell, but given the recent hype I'd bet that most people want to be long. You need balls of brass to naked short something as 'bubbly' Bitcoin. To begin with, the margin requirement for an asset as volatile as Bitcoin will be quite high, so you'd have to put a lot of capital in a margin account to naked short Bitcoin. That alone will limit how much people can short Bitcoin.

Core makes propositions to the community, and if the community likes what they see, they implement it. Just think about what would happen if core tried to push for a 1% tail inflation.

You don't value unrealized potential like you value proven, working technologies. Quite the opposite.

I'm a Monero ( &amp; Bitcoin ) fan, and I agree that obfuscation mechanisms are a double-edged sword. The cypherpunk in me admires Monero, but the realist think that having some traceability might boost acceptance by governments and other large decision-makers.
What attracted me to Bitcoin back in the day was not that it was anonymous, but that the supply was capped ( = inflation-free, eventually ). 
In the end Bitcoin is the lightest and most decentralized network, no alt can ever hope to beat it on this front. Monero is the most anonymous coin, more anonymous than a Bitcoin sidechain could ever hope to be - the inescapable weakness of any anonymous Bitcoin sidechain is that the coins must eventually come back on the traceable mainchain. In the end, there might be room for both.

The block size will probably grow, but very conservatively. Schnorr alone will delivery an additional 30% capacity. But it is critically important that the lower layer remains decentralized because if the lower layer becomes censorable then the higher layers will become affected as well, while the opposite is not true.

Many are driven by FOMO and their animal spirits.
Bitcoin post-segwit can handle 500k transaction a day, it can power the economy of a small city.  This is not worth 100 billions. To put this in perspective, 100 billion dollars is the narrow money supply of a country as big as Turkey. 
And yes, I am aware that the current market value is supposed to price the unrealized potential of Bitcoin - that is if you believe that the crypto markets are efficient and not driven by testosterone and FOMO. So let's talk about the potential shall we? LN has been stuck in 6-more-weeks mode forever; 18 months ago it was being deployed on testnet and just around the corner. Last I heard LN devs were still trying to find ways to have payment channels without pushing every transaction to every participant ( which would be a very poor scaling solution ). 
I am willing to put a premium on Bitcoin relative to fiat because it does thing that fiat cannot do ( low inflation, uncensorability and financial sovereignty ), but the premium would have to be very generous to get to the current valuation.

Most people won't be able to open a channel.
Assuming 500k transaction a day in a segwit world, you get 182,500,000 transactions per year. Just opening and closing a channel means that no more than 91,250,000 people per year could transact on the main chain.
You can tweak the parameters a bit, but roughly speaking, the point still stands Most people will have to go completely off-chain.

Not really. There are two types of futures ( and options ): delivery and non-delivery. In the latter case, you don't deliver the underlying asset. Instead, you settle the contract for the value of the underlying, in USD. The exchange fixes the value of the contract every day, and you just pay (or receive) whatever the exchange says Bitcoin is worth (typically based on actual prices reported by exchanges ).

My problem with censorship ( on all forums )
1-it goes against the spirit of the community
2-it needlessly gives ammunition to your opponents - and exacerbate the tension between the two groups.
3-in the end censorship is useless because the other party will just move to other venues. By separating rbtc and rbitcoin you are preventing a meaningful discussion between the two parties . This subreddit is an echo chamber for segwit-proponent and rbtc is an echo chamber for big-blocks
tl;dr; censorship is pointless on the internet, and probably counterproductive

What is the percentage of miners who are pro-Segwit right now? I read that it's around 50%, which is way too low for a safe fork.
I always said that the 95% threshold was too high, but doing a UASF with half the miners on board means that the network will be congested till the next difficulty adjustment, which could take up to 4 weeks if we lose half the hash rate. 
The problem can be further exacerbated if some miners decide to mine empty blocks, out of spite.

That's not how it works in practice. If  politics and ideology affects the miners' profitability (or their perceived profitability ), then it makes sense for them to influence the outcome. It also make sense for them to record a small short term loss in order to book a larger long-term gain.

Actually I didn't take the segwit one time block increase into account.
30-minute blocks + 2MB (effective) blocks means that the network would function at 66% capacity, which still is not very good. The settlement delay will still be 30 minutes per confirmation, which is not very good as well.
And that doesn't account for hostile miners mining empty blocks.
It seems to me that UASF is a dangerous gamble. At the very least, we should give the community more time to prepare and get more miners on board. You need at least 50% of the miners signalling UASF. Also signalling segwit is not the same as signalling UASF, as some conservative miners may be pro-segwit but anti-UASF.

Also it's a hardfork, so it's the whole ecosystem that needs to be upgraded, not just core. That includes miners, exchange, wallets, alternative clients etc. There's not enough development resources to do that in a few weeks especially when the few talented coders right now are already busy implementing Segwit. **If you want to hardfork, even a supposedly innocuous one, you need to give the ecosystem at least 12 months before the new feature activates.**

Anything that is physically located in China is effectively controled by the Chinese government. That's how totalitarian countries work.

If you lose 60% of hashing power, blocks will be mined 60% slower ( 1 per 25 minutes ) until the next difficulty readjustment which will take 2 weeks / ( 1 -0.6 ) = 5 weeks to happen.

This is not a choice. BTC1 has no active development. It is merely a fork of Bitcoin core with a few lines changed. 
Most core developers work for free because of a higher calling. Nobody wants to be an employee of a scoundrel such as Jihan for a $0 salary. If core developers leave, miners will be forced to fund BTC1, possibly with sub-par developers. This will make the situation even more dangerous since the developers will be subdued by the miners and will not be able to work at arm's length, removing a major check and balance from the Bitcoin ecosystem.

I am starting to change my mind about a POW change, but only if:
-you can gather consensus around a specific algorithm, which is easier said than done
-we give enough time to the current miners to amortize their hardware. Miners are still necessary to secure the network. If you burn them, they will be reluctant in investing in Bitcoin-mining hardware. Or they will ask for a higher RoI to compensate for the risk which in the end means the same: less security.
I am wondering if it's possible to adopt a hybrid PoW, with the old PoW gradually being phased out ( through a difficulty bomb ) , and the new PoW gradually being phased in ( through a reverse difficulty bomb ).

The current situation reminds me of the 90's when people thought that laws did not apply on the internet and could not be enforced there. Sure Bitcoin is mostly anonymous right now, but in a few years most transactions will be deanonymized.
Bitcoin will still be uncensorable and 'uninflationable' but if you think that the state is going to auto-dissolve because blockchain, think again.

Indeed. This is very bad for shapeshift, though not all alts support atomic swaps  ( they will have to eventually if they want to stay popular ).
This means that as long as one crypto remains legal, all cryptos can survive since you will be able to buy the desired crypto legally and swap without any risk and for little fees. In other words, all cryptos supporting atomic swaps will be able to piggy-back on the legal / liquid one.

There's always manual replay protection, but that isn't my biggest concern. If you don't care about 2x than you shouldn't care about spending coins by mistake on that chain. The problems in my eyes are :
1-hardforking without consensus risks splitting the community, creating a permanent rift and a permanent loss of value for everybody. We will end up with 3 coins claiming to be the one and true Bitcoin. This will increase confusion in the outside world and provide arguments to our critics
2-the hard fork will also severely disrupts Bitcoin by taking away hashing power and making transaction confirmation time very slow. Yes the difficulty will eventually readjust but in **usability could be severely affected for weeks.**
3-BTC &amp; BCH sharing the same PoW **makes hashing power unstable enough**. Add a third coin to the equation and hashing power will be even more volatile.

In two months it won’t matter. Why? **Because Bitcoin and Segwit2X cannot both survive**.
I used to think that both coins would survive and that both communities would divorce and live happily ever after.
The problem is that both coins share the same PoW algorithm.
If both coins survive the hashing power will fluctuate dramatically from one coin to the other depending on short term price fluctuations, making both coins unusable. We'll have periods where Segwit2X works and Bitcoin doesn't, and periods where Bitcoin works and Segwit2X doesn't. The situation is untenable on the long-term.
The only reason why Bitcoin cash is able to survive the extreme hashrate volatility is because of EDA, which Bitcoin and S2X do not implement. Bitcoin and S2X will not, cannot both survive. **This is why S2X will not implement replay protection: because either it manages to kill Bitcoin early on, or Bitcoin will kill S2X.**

You seem to think that if many transactions are made to the same address, they will merge into one UTXO. This is wrong, UTXOs sent to the same address do not consolidate. Each transaction made with their so-called replay protection adds one additional output to the 3Bit address. One million transactions with replay protection means one million unspent outputs assigned to the 3Bit address.
The worst case scenario (unlikely) is that each existing UTXO goes through its own replay protection transaction, which will translate into two UTXO: a duplicate of the original one + a new one assigned to the 3Bit address. This would effectively double the UTXO set. In practice it is likely that some addresses containing several UTXOs will consolidate their UTXOs, but the fact remain that there would be an absudrly high number of UTXOs sent to the 3Bit address.
For the record, this is how you implement replay protection: 
They are attempting to make transaction with replay protection larger in size, bloating our blockchain and reducing transaction capacity at a time when less blocks are being mined. This is a clear attempt to make the attack even more severe. This is not a case of incompetent instead of hostile, this is a case of hostile. Even Segwit2X developers cannot be that incompetent.

He can't just 'Sell both' with no replay protection, can he? No replay protection is an attack.




What are you interested in? A hard fork for the sake of it or a block increase? Because you just got the latter with Segwit. That should give us a 12-18 months respite. A hard fork block increase will eventually happen, but when it will be necessary. 
The fact remains that S2x is happening without consensus. I am not saying that S2X has no traction at all, but many major players are against it, so you're clearly attempting to change the protocol against the wish of many - even if not all - users. That is an attack. I would have been more lenient if you were trying to sell the resulting coin as an alt, or at the very least implemented replay protection, but forking the protocol without consensus and replay protection and calling it Bitcoin is an attack. There are many users who do not want S2X without consensus, and forcing our hand is not something we will merely forget.

Miners are signalling their intent to hardfork, and will attempt to do so on Nov 19. However mining is very expensive and the coin they intend to mine is not necessarily profitable to mine. If users refuse to follow, miners will be mining a worthless coin incurring huge losses and will be forced to come back to the 1MB chain. 
Miners think that the opposite is true: that users are forced to follow them because they will not be able to transact on the 1MB chain. I disagree. Time is on our side. Users can afford to wait ( holding is free ), while miners have to pay huge bills. If it comes to that I'd rather use my mastercard than transact on Segwit2x.

Every dollar of capital JPM owns can be leveraged by borrowing money and buying assets. The condition is that the assets you buy through leverage are relatively stable. Bitcoin does not fall under this category.
Assuming a leverage ratio of 12 ( which is typical for a modern bank ), buying 6.5 billions worth of Bitcoin means that JPM needs to reduce its balance sheet by 6.5 * 12 = 78 billions. So for JPM, there's an opportunity cost of buying Bitcoin, because those 78 billions worth of assets could have yielded nice profits ( from which you would have to subtract capital / borrowing cost ).

I predict that both chains will survive as both chains have supporters.
The loss of hashing power will be disruptive to the 1MB chain on the short term, but miners will fail to destroy  it because it is more popular*. Once it becomes clear that the 1MB chain will survive and is more popular, miners will come back because it is more profitable to mine - unless they want to mine at a loss.
Why do I think that the 1MB chain is more popular?
-It has way more nodes. Nodes are not a perfect metric, but still indicate that there are way more core supporters than btc1 supporters.
-There's also Luke-jr sybil resistant poll which indicate that the majority of users do not want a hard-fork now.
-There's also the fact that r/bitcoin &amp; bitcointalk.com have more activity than r/btc &amp; bicoin.com's forum.

Miners will mine whatever is most profitable regardless of what they are signalling. Some ideological miners might choose to mine at a loss but on the most miners will mine whatever chain is more profitable. And if the 1MB chain retains more users, it will profitable to mine.

This is not replay protection, this is a joke. Their way to protect your coin is for you to send some dust to a specific address. The direct consequence of this is that they force us to increase the transaction size by one output ( 34 byte ). Your average transaction size goes from 480 byte to 514. This represent a capacity decrease of 7% at a time when the network will be under severe strain. This is not replay protection, this is a poison pill.
This will also contribute to the bloating of the UTXO set. The worst case scenario ( to be fair, it's  not necessarily the most realistic  ) is that this so-called replay protection will double the size of the UTXO set. I am certain that the nefarious effects of their 'replay protection' have not been lost on them, and that it has been designed to be as harmful as possible.

My opinion exactly. 
I've read the white paper several times, and while I appreciate the genius that Satoshi was, it is evident that Bitcoin has flaws. The first addresses (p2pk) are not quantum proof. Transaction malleability is a characteristic of Bitcoin but hardly a feature. There were other vectors of attack that were fixed during the early years. Not that I hold any of that against Satoshi, the guy was clearly a genius and he was able to build something great with no prior data to draw upon (unlike alt coins who had the possibility of learning from Bitcoin's flaws). My point is that Bitcoin is great, but not perfect, so why not accept that the protocol has to be improved?

Governance damage.
It's about the governance issue, not the bigger blocks. If they manage to win this battle, it will be bigger and bigger blocks after. Jihan wants inflation as well: We don't want shady miners in charge of the network. We don't want people like Ver and Garzik who have a history of fuck-ups in charge of the network ( I'm referring to the number of times XT, classic or unlimited went down because of poor coding ).
I agree that bigger blocks might be needed in the future, but let’s cross that bridge once all other options are exhausted ( segwit, LN, Schnorr signatures).

@_date: 2017-09-28 13:49:11
It's not only core's decision. BTC1 is essentially a core fork with a block size increase so there are already quasi-core binaries with the change you are proposing. And guess what? Users are not installing them. 
We will probably need to increase the block size through a hard-fork the future, but it makes sense to do so once all options have been exhausted. We have Segwit for short term capacity increase, we have secondary layers for medium term capacity increase. Once / if those options are exhausted we should consider on-chain capacity increase. In the meanwhile, having smallish blocks keep the network resilient, and having full blocks encourage people to use blockchain space as efficiently as possible.

Keep your keys under your control. Put a small amount of money into an altcoin.
( in the below tainted means valid on one chain but not on the other )
After a fork try to get a 'tainted' output ( valid under one chain but not on the other ). You can do this by exchanging your altcoin for tainted bitcoins / s2x coins. One tainted Satoshi on any of the chains is enough.
Generate a transaction mixing your pre-fork coins with your tainted coins ( you can send the whole balance back to your wallet ). The transaction will only be valid on one chain. This is manual replay protection.
Note: Exchanges will likely taint their coins very early, because they don't want to lose money by mistakenly giving you both bitcoins and s2x coins if you paid for just one of those. While I am confident that any coin obtained on an exchange will be valid on one chain only, make sure to check that it's the case by looking at an online block explorer.
 Don't use shapeshift or any service that support the s2x attack. If you want to support Bitcoin, dump your s2x coins. 
I intend to give up 1/2 or 2/3 of my s2x coins (I'm keeping some as there's the possibility that I could be wrong, but many indicators show that the current consensus has more users ).

I don't mind a 2MB block but I don't see any reason for it **right now**. 2MB blocks are likely to happen in the future, but there's no reason for a hardfork **right now**. Reasons:
-we have enough additional capacity thanks to Segwit. Blocks are not even near to being full at the moment. And we'll have even more capacity when second layers are deployed.
-UTXO set. Having too much free space encourages inefficient uses of the blockchain. Segwit + 2MB means a lot of extra space at once, which will encourage people to start squandering blockchain resources. It makes more sense to have Segwit now, and as blocks start to be full again to have another increase - and only if LN cannot handle the additional demand.  **Free transactions are not the bonanza they appear to be.**
-the capacity crisis of the last 12 months was partially manufactured by miners.  
-hard-forking is a big deal since it tells the world that Bitcoin is not immutable. If we're going to lose our hardforking virginity, let it be because of important features, not just because of a stupid block-size increase. There's a bunch of non-contentious improvements that can be incorporated to the protocol, let's all bundle them together since those opportunities won't come every other day.
The problem posed by Segwit2x is that it transforms Bitcoin from a libertarian project designed to give financial sovereignty to the user to a bizcoin designed to make money for businesses while financial sovereignty takes a backseat to corporate interests. Corporations have no souls, no ideals, they just care about making money and treat the users like cash cows. I'm not saying making money is bad or corporations are not needed, but this is not what Bitcoin is about. Bitcoin is about financial sovereignty.
I disagree with you OP, a compromise is not the best course of action. At this point I'd rather have a showdown. I'm curious to see who's really in control of this project: the users or the miners ( core is nothing in itself, it only has power because it has the trust and the respect of the users ).
I thought that there was a fair chance that both coins would survive but the more I think about it, the more I am convinced that **both coins cannot survive on the long term** since they share the same PoW. The hashing power will fluctuate dramatically from one coin to the other depending on short term price fluctuations: we'll have periods where s2x works and Bitcoin doesn't, and periods where Bitcoin works and s2x doesn't. The only reason why Bitcoin cash is able to survive hashrate volatility now is because of EDA, which Bitcoin and S2X do not implement. Bitcoin and S2X will not both survive.
@_date: 2017-10-01 10:19:21


It's a smaller problem for BTC because a large majority of  nodes today run core, which means that it's almost certain that some of the nodes you're connected to will remain valid after a fork.

There will be no replay protection, and even if there were it would make no difference.
Why? **Because Bitcoin and Segwit2X cannot both survive**.
I used to think that both coins would survive and that both communities would divorce and live happily ever after.
The problem is that both coins share the same PoW algorithm.
If both coins survive the hashing power will fluctuate dramatically from one coin to the other depending on short term price fluctuations, making both coins unusable. We'll have periods where Segwit2X works and Bitcoin doesn't, and periods where Bitcoin works and Segwit2X doesn't. The situation is untenable on the long-term.
The only reason why Bitcoin cash is able to survive the extreme hashrate volatility is because of EDA, which Bitcoin and S2X do not implement. Bitcoin and S2X will not, cannot both survive. **This is why S2X will not implement replay protection: because either it manages to kill Bitcoin quickly, or Bitcoin will kill S2X.** If this does not qualify as an attack, I don't know what does.
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:37:39
A fork with no consensus or no replay protection is an attack against users.
By not having replay protection I am forced to choose between the 1MB chain or the 2MB chain. If I choose the 1MB chain and the 2MB gains traction ( the 1MB chain fails economically), I will lose everything. If I choose the 2MB chain and it fails economically while the 1MB gain traction, I will lose everything. So at best the fork is preventing from using my coins until there's a clear winner, at worse it is putting my possessions at risk.
By forking without consensus, which is stupid because I believe that consensus shouldn't be hard to reach when there will be an actual need for a block size increase, you're putting me at risk. This is why Segwit2X without replay protection is an attack. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 10:43:33

1-do you regard Segwit as a positive or negative development? If you regard Segwit as a negative development,  why activate it at all? And if you regard Segwit as a positive development, why not activate it on its own merit regardless of a block size increase?
2-do you believe that Segwit2x has consensus? If not, do you realize what a hard-fork with no consensus can do to this community?
3-the protocol in its current state is able to handle the current demand, so why hard-fork now ?

As intended means: inflating our currency and transferring value from holders to those who create money ( banks mainly, central banks to a lesser degree).
And they create money almost for free, this process is pure profit for them. At least in Bitcoin the money creation process has an embedded cost, mining coins is only marginally profitable.

Yeah well that's happens when you don't have replay protection.
My guess is that right after the fork we will see as an instant drop in transactions as nobody wants to double spend their coins, so exchanges will be able to generate as many transactions they need.

It will survive, because the community will fight Segwit2x  tooth and nail.
Bitcoin is not resistant because the code is enchanted. It's resistant because the community is vigilant. A major actor of the community is attempting to size power ( the miners ), and Bitcoin is not going to survive if we just sit down and say 'oh it's resistant by design, no need to worry'. What makes it resistant is the fact that many actors will actively resist a contentious hard-fork.

While I supported the objectives of the UASF movement, I am not sure what would have happened had the miners not activated Segwit from their own volition.
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:11:54
You seem to think that if many transactions are made to the same address, they will merge into one UTXO. This is wrong, UTXOs sent to the same address do not consolidate. Each transaction made with their so-called replay protection adds one additional output to the 3Bit address. One million transactions with replay protection means one million unspent outputs assigned to the 3Bit address. 
The worst case scenario (unlikely) is that each existing UTXO goes through its own replay protection transaction, which will translate into two UTXO: a duplicate of the original one + a new one assigned to the 3Bit address. This would effectively double the UTXO set. In practice it is likely that some addresses containing several UTXOs will consolidate their UTXOs, but the fact remain that there would be an absudrly high number of UTXOs sent to the 3Bit address.
 For the record, this is how you implement replay protection: 
They are attempting to make transaction with replay protection larger in size, bloating our blockchain and reducing transaction capacity at a time when less blocks are being mined. This is a clear attempt to make the attack even more severe. This is not a case of incompetent instead of hostile, this is a case of hostile. Even Segwit2X developers cannot be *that* incompetent.

You can't have a hardfork on a short notice because businesses / users / wallets / exchanges can't upgrade on a short notice. Writing, testing, and deploying code takes time.
If Bitcoin remains more popular than s2xcoin then it will be worth more, and miners make more money by mining the coin that is worth the most. Some miners may choose to mine at a loss but most won't. So either miners manage to kill Bitcoin in the first few days ( they won't ) or they'll come back eventually.
Why do I think that the 1MB chain will be more popular?
-It has way more nodes. Nodes are not a perfect metric, but still indicate that there are way more core supporters than btc1 supporters.
-There's also Luke-jr sybil resistant poll which indicate that the majority of users do not want a hard-fork now.
-There's also the fact that r/bitcoin &amp; bitcointalk.com have more activity than r/btc &amp; bicoin.com's forum.

An atom in this context is assumed to be the most basic element, there can be no finer granularity. 'Atomic swap'  means that you swap one cryptocurrency for another, and the transaction can not be broken into smaller parts. It either happens completely or not at all.
So either the whole transaction happens, or it completely fails. You cannot have a scenario where you send BTC but the other party fails to deliver LTC. It makes it possible to build decentralized, crypto-to-crypto exchanges for little to no fees.
Note that: 1) not all coins support atomic swaps (but most will) 2)fiat-to-crypto transactions still have to go through centralized exchange

The key difference is EDA ( in the case of Bitcoin cash). You cannot have two coins with the same PoW and the same difficulty adjustment algorithm.
This why we shouldn’t expect replay protection from the S2X gang. For their coin to survive they have to kill ours, so it makes no sense for them to help us survive the fork.

Adoption, market value are important, but not as important as robustness/decentralization.
We need to stay in a position where we can say F U to any government who tries to influence the protocol.
Maybe Chinese miners will be happy to know that they only need a satellite dish and an old Nokia 3310 to stay in sync with the rest of the network ( the irony ).
It's good news on the long term. On the short term an instant ban will disrupt the network.

Honestly even if Satoshi sold all his coins, which I doubt, it would translate into a 6% inflation. If he spread the sales on 5 years, it would translate into a 1.5% inflation.

Their version of replay protection makes matters worse. By design, it forces us to add an output, significanly increasing transaction size and reducing throughput at a time when the network capacit is under severe strain. Also it significantly bloats our UTXO set.

Reduced supply from the miner community. The inflation is divided by two after the halving. However the inflation is relatively low now, and each subsequent halving have less and less effect on the inflation.
Each halving is less noticeable than the previous, so don't expect the coming halving to result in a large price increase.
The inflation will go from 3.7% to 1.8%. It's bullish but way less significant than the previous halving, see [
@_date: 2019-09-15 15:29:51


Miners must be paid. And yes you are right there is a difference between maintaining the network through transaction fees (tax the users), or inflation (tax the owners).
In general I agree with you and you present a lot of good arguments. Every constant Satoshi made was based on assumptions that may or may not be optimal. But to introduce human governance would also open the system to abuse. There is simply no perfect system. 


I agree. But all coins with a tail emission have a fee system as well, those are not mutually exclusive.

This is not true. By not having replay protection you're forcing me to choose between the 1MB chain or the 2MB chain. If I choose the 1MB chain and the 2MB gains traction while the 1MB fails, I will lose everything. If I choose the 2MB chain and it fails while the 1MB gain traction, I will lose everything. So at best you're preventing from using my coins until there's a clear winner, at worse you're putting my possessions at risk. 
By forking without consensus, and stupidly because I believe that consensus shouldn't be hard to reach when there will be an actual need for a block size increase, you're putting me at risk. This is why Segwit2X without replay protection is an attack.

Segwit was planned, too bad Jihan decided to block it to preserve AsicBoost. Additional capacity should be done through other layers and a hard-fork should be delayed for as long as possible.

Honestly we should not care that the supply is finite, we should care that the yearly inflation is low enough.
Maintaining / securing the network is very costly and miners must be paid for it. Either we the users pay through fees, or we pay through newly issued coins.
The way I see it, a monetary inflation of 0.1% wouldn't really affect my purchasing power during my lifetime, but there will always be some guy who would argue that on a billion years quite a lot of bitcoins would be created. I could also point that some coins are de facto lost every day, and that price inflation and monetary inflation are not exactly the same thing, but that would be too long of a conversation.

The core business of a bank is to receive and lend money. There will still be businesses in a post-Bitcoin world, and there will still be demand for loans. So there will still be banks in a post-Bitcoin world. 
A major cash cow for banks is the ability to conduct fractional reserve banking. Creating money through leverage. This activity produces huge positive benefits (for the bank) and negative externalities (for the hapless taxpayer who has to bailout bank or lose his job because of a depression ).
**That's the interesting part**: the type of monetary system has a direct impact on how much a bank can leverage money. The more constrained the money supply is, the less leveraged the financial system is. Under a constrained monetary system there is less leverage because the ability to bailout banks is limited - since you can't create money out of thin air. Bank who leverage themselves too much are regularly eliminated through financial Darwinism. 
-under the pre-1913 gold standard (2% monetary inflation), the leverage ratio was around 7
-under today's monetary system (4-6% monetary inflation ) the leverage ratio is around 12 ( probably more since there are so many loopholes in Basel III, and so many entities that are unregulated)
-under Bitcoin (eventually 0% inflation, probably a small deflation considering lost coins), the bank will not be able to leverage themselves as much. I won't hazard a guess, but the pre-1913 will be an upper bound.
*note that monetary inflation is different though related to price inflation*

I am not advocating changing the nature of Bitcoin at this point. I am saying that an alternative design with a small, residual tail emission would have been acceptable to me.
Eventually Bitcoin must be able to survive on transaction fees alone. Those transaction fees must also be high enough to keep the network secure. As of today, there are no example of coins being able to survive on transaction fees only. Note that I am not saying that it's not possible, merely that it is a challenge.

Keep your keys under your control. Put a small amount of money into an altcoin.
( in the below tainted means valid on one chain but not on the other )
After a fork try to get a 'tainted' output ( valid under one chain but not on the other ). You can do this by exchanging your altcoin for tainted bitcoins / s2x coins. One tainted Satoshi on any of the chains is enough.
Generate a transaction mixing your pre-fork coins with your tainted coins ( you can send the whole balance back to your wallet ). The transaction will only be valid on one chain. This is manual replay protection.
Note: Exchanges will likely taint their coins very early, because they don't want to lose money by mistakenly giving you both bitcoins and s2x coins if you paid for just one of those. While I am confident that any coin obtained on an exchange will be valid on one chain only, make sure to check that it's the case by looking at an online block explorer.
 Don't use shapeshift or any service that support the s2x attack. If you want to support Bitcoin, dump your s2x coins. 
I intend to give up 1/2 or 2/3 of my s2x coins (I'm keeping some as there's the possibility that I could be wrong, but many indicators show that the current consensus has more users ).

It means full.
A LN channel is bidirectional but has a finite capacity depending on how it was initiated.
Ex: I put 0.5 BTC in a lightning channel and you put 0.5 BTC. You send me 5 payments of 0.1 BTC. Now the channel is saturated from my perspective ( I can't receive any more coins from you ). 
If you need to send me more money, we need to open a new channel. Ideally I'd spend spend some of those coins and return them to you, which would make the channel available again. But sometimes  the need to spend does not arise and the channel remains full. In this case I can either keep the channel open, waiting for a spending opportunity, or we can close the channel and settle the balance on-chain.
@_date: 2018-04-21 13:05:37
 I got the 3 wrong, but my analysis still stands.
LN channels can also become saturated, which means that people will need more than one. You also have to account for businesses, and people doing transactions on-chain. 


I am fully aware that full on-chain scaling is unworkable. Even if it was you could never hope to achieve instant confirmations on-chain, which is a major LN achievement. What I am trying to say is full off-chain scaling is also unworkable. We're going to need a mix of both.

You can't have bulletproof on the base layer without a hard fork. 
Optional bulletproof leaks information, so it's kind of useless. If I send 1 BTC to your empty address using bulletproof, and you later send 1 BTC to another person without bulletproof, external parties can infer data about the first transaction. This is one of many possible cases but you get the point.
Bulletproofs transaction are 10-15x larger than normal transactions. With optional bulletproof you'll get all the fun of a bloated blockchain and little extra privacy. I'm a Monero fan so I'm all for those privacy techniques, but either we do it right or we don't.

Not strictly, there is a random factor. The network will find one block per 10 minutes on average, but there is variance. Check blockchain.info


Miners decide which transactions to include, and they are incentivized to include the transactions with the higher fees because they make more money. Many miners will decide to include transactions with lower fees if they deem them important ( high amount, or if they have been sitting in the pool without confirming for too long). Miners can decide to include whatever transactions they want though, but the more fees the more money for them. Some miners occasionally include no transactions at all, forfeiting the fees . The fee get paid to the miner who included the transaction in his block, so they are not equally distributed among miners.


It depends on the type of transaction ( some are bigger than others ) but I think the maximum average is around 5 in practice.


The security is directly proportional to the miners' revenue, so it's the ( miner's reward + transaction fees ) * price . The reward will go down in time, but we're hoping that the fees will go up ( not too much though :), and that price will go up as well. But nobody is sure if the network can sustain itself purely on transaction fees because it has never happened in the real world yet. Some coins have perpetual inflation to sustain mining activities, but we're hoping we can avoid that.


The impact was strong during the early days, but the inflation rate right now is low and getting lower, so the impact of newly minted coins is not very important.


The thing is, eventually the only thing that is going to secure the network are those fees. So having high fees is both desirable (for security ) and undesirable (for users).
 &gt;Is it necessary to wait for your transaction to go through 6 blocks? Are there security risks only going through 2?
1 block is enough in 99.9% of the cases. The risk of having a transaction reverted diminishes exponentially with each block. If you're buying a house with Bitcoin then waiting a few blocks is better, otherwise one block is safe.


Bitcoin is NOT anonymous, you can be tracked but not always, and not easily. Satoshi's transactions are on the blockchain, but determining which ones are his cannot be done with 100% certainty. We have some cues because a very early miner mined a lot of coins and his mining nonce followed a specific pattern. They are possibly Satoshi's but we can't say it with 100% certainty  . 
 &gt;Is Bitcoin Core or other Full nodes necessary to keep the network functioning? Is Bitcoin Core outdated compared to other alternatives? From what I have read the 200gigs, memory usage etc. Are there risks to having too few full node miners? And do full node miners get any more incentives to use full nodes?
Having full nodes make the network more robust, but not everybody need to run one. Bitcoin core is not mandatory in theory. In practice bitcoin core is the reference client. It's far from being obsolete as it's continuously updated by the core team. It's a cutting edge piece of software actually, and the high memory usage is caused by storing the full blockchain and validating all the transactions. Most users do not need to store the full blockchain ( you can  keep only the relevant bits which are quite smaller and get rid of the rest, or you can run a light client like electrum )


Normal nodes do not require ASICs but mining nodes do. Whether ASICs are a good or a bad thing for the network's health is a huge debate. I won't get into it but there are definitely trade-offs to each option.


Better performance overall. Some transactions that could have caused performance problems were made non standard for example. Some features were introduced to make second layer like the lightning network possible in practice.

Not really. Authorities can and will harass first layer users if their coins get mixed with unsavory coins on a second layer. When that happens most people will think twice before using anonymous second layers. When it comes to privacy, either you go all the way or you don't. 
I am a Monero fan so I'm all for privacy, but I'd rather have a trackable coin than a half-private coin that will give me the illusion of privacy, which could be a dangerous thing for many users.

More like not perfectly decentralized since there will be plenty of hubs / routes to choose from. There is a middle ground between perfectly decentralized and perfectly centralized. 
Hubs are routing points, not banks in the sense that they cannot block transactions or confiscate funds. Some hubs might misbehave but in time hubs that are known to be reliable will develop a good reputation and people will flock to them. While hubs that are relatively new or known to be problematic will be avoided.
That's for the ideal scenario. Right now LN is still a bit experimental and we don't really know what the network topology will look like in practice.

Our blocks will be full very quickly because there's a lot of demand for bitcoin transactions - just look at the transaction fee.

No system is engineered perfectly, including Bitcoin. Hard ford will occasionally occur, but never for frivolous reasons. Would you be against a hard fork if SHA256 was broken? If in 20 years the average human being has a 20 GB/sec internet connection and a 100 TB hard disk, would you be against a blocksize increase?
I think that many core devs are not against the idea of a block size increase, they are just conservative about it ( which is good ) . LN will affect the network in unpredictable way, and it's better to have some data before committing to a specific course of action.

And 2 MB is still waaay closer to our vision than to theirs. You're swallowing a pill, they are swallowing a basket ball.
Honestly, I get that the most important characterisic of Bitcoin is to be decentralized. It is also quite possible that the network might work effectively with LN + 300KB blocks. But even at 2MB the blockchain's size should remain manageable. You can buy terabytes of storage cheaply, and pretty soon we'll all have fiber optics in our homes.

The market is asking for more transactions, hence the higher fees. Bitcoin will die if the demand for more transactions is not met, because this demand will move to alts. Right now the transaction supply is capped because there is no on-chain scaling, and no off-chain scaling as well. So we get the worst of both world.

Those don't necessary have that kind of money. Bitcoin was not worth 26 billion 8 years ago. Having so much money secured by little computing power gives an incentive to bad people to do bad things.
If a POW change is necessary then at the very least the miners' losses should be mitigated. For example the PoW should change 12 to 18 months after the fork is locked ( by which time the hardware would be worth significantly less ). Other people suggested having both the new and the old algorithm run in series, with SHA256 being progressively phased out ( I am not an expert so I am not sure if this is technically possible  but maybe you can comment on the subject).
It seems to me that the major issue with SHA256 is not the PoW itself, but the concentration of manufacturing in the hands of a few people. However changing the PoW does not guarantee that this does not happen again, so unless the community wants to do regular hard-forks, a better course of action would be to encourage / finance other ASIC manufacturers.
Bitcoin has two advantages over alts: security and network effects. Let us not squander one of those advantages lightly.
@_date: 2017-05-03 23:06:57
No additional economic activity is possible right now on bitcoin, because blocks are full. Hopefully some form of scaling will be achieved, but right now no scaling is happening. Until scaling happens, additional market value comes from speculating about what the future might be, and too much additional valuation means too much speculating, which screams bubble to me.

@_date: 2017-05-16 14:17:46
I agree, but if the economic majority chain does not have enough hashpower, the transaction rate is going to be awful for a few weeks ( until difficulty readjusts basically ).   
A few weeks is a lot of time in the crypto world. Maybe Bitcoin will crash and people will move to an alt. Maybe it won't. Maybe Bitcoin will recover. Maybe it won't. Are you willing to play Russian roulette with the greatest financial innovation in decades?

It could have been very bad. The hacker stole 150k coins where he could have stole 900k.  I own some ETH and I acknowledge that the technology is very powerful but it is also very fragile.
One of the template contract was buggy, so this is a bit more concerning than a wallet / exchange being hacked. An exchange being hacked is a problem that is unrelated to the core technology, that hack was not.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but "non-standard" means that the transaction will not be relayed. It doesn't mean that it is invalid. Miners can mine non-standard transactions.  
It's a double edged sword though. As miners will be able to 'mine' more coins, there will be more supply which will suppress the price.

A hanfful of alts have interesting features, but most are pump-and-dumps.  They are not as 'uncensorable' as Bitcoin, they are not as decentralized as Bitcoin. 
A failed Bitcoin will tell the public that there will always be a new crypto, so why invest in the current big thing instead of the next. And if the current big thing fails so can the next big thing, so you might as well stick to government-issued fiat.
Bitcoin must succeed, anything that comes after will never be as unifying.

A large majority of miner are signalling BIP91. So **assuming that the miners are not lying**, they will hard-fork the chain. Economic nodes will get the last word though, but if economic nodes end up on a chain with little hashpower they will face a lot of issues. 
Worse case scenario: some miners might mine empty block on the original chain and flood the mempool with spam, which would make the original chain unusable.

I can't find anything, maybe I was mistaken.
Satoshi made conflicting statements but people have to realize that he was building an entire monetary system from scratch, and that he had to take educated guesses. So many of those guesses were right, but no system can be engineered perfectly, let alone a revolutionary system that has no equivalent in human history, and no historical data to build upon. 
The guy was a genius not a deity, and we shouldn't treat every word he said like it came from God. We have more experience to draw upon today, and I'm pretty sure that Satoshi's opinions would be different on many points.

Even saving accounts need the occasional inflow / outflow of money. If the transaction number is capped, then there are only so many saving accounts that you can support on bitcoin. A capped transaction number caps will cap the currency's usage, there's no way around this ( until we have some form of scaling at least ).

The capacity increase is the least important feature of Segwit, but it is very much needed. However, you can bet that Segwit blocks will be full soon, and LN is still years away. We need to plan for the future.
Doing Segwit now and the 2MB increase later may be the most reasonable course of action. However if Segwit +2 MB can help bring the folks in rbtc in the fold, then let's do it. The more consensus the merrier.
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:59:18
Agreed but he's not completely wrong.
There's a difference between slightly bigger blocks with a hardcoded max size, and very big blocks whose size is set dynamically.

Actually miners will mine in proportion to net earning, which is price - production cost. If the price of a coin is too low to make a profit, miners will start leaving till the difficulty readjust and make mining profitable enough.
So in aggregate, I expect miners to divide hashpower in proportion to the profit generated by each coin.
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:26:06
They will need to muster at least 51% of the hashing power. Easier said than done.
@_date: 2017-05-23 12:12:10
It is a new era, but the price might be getting ahead. In theory bitcoin could go to a million dollar, we still have to adjust for various risks - a global crackdown, a bug, failure to scale, major hack, surprise quantum computers, alts, public rejection etc...
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:14:59
What is important is that the network remains decentralized. Bitcoin is not a religion, and updating the protocol is not a heresy.
A 2MB hardbound block is not the same as EC.
Why did Satoshi use a 1MB size instead of 750 KB, or 1500 KB? It's a nice round number, that's it.
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:45:30
By this logic, hundreds of millions of people can afford running a node instead of billions. Still decentralized enough to me.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:22:54
The code is open source and doesn't belong to anybody.
I don't see it gaining traction as it is basically a bitcoin clone with a more limited following, given that many merchants and exchange will not care for it. Other alts have a market value because of features, but the only feature BCC has is bigger blocks, and blocks aren't even full right now.
That said, in case LN fails to deliver, it's nice to have a fallback plan.

Exactly. You're broacasting an 'anyone can spend' transaction as far as their protocol is concerned which is hardly the same thing as stealing. They have no obligations to pander to Segwit users on their chain, just like we have no obligations to pander to miners or asic boost users on our chain.
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:30:57
Right. Well they need to find enough economic actors that want to work with this coin. If you don't have exchanges in every major economic area listing 'Bitcoin cash', as well as merchants, then it's dead on arrival.

If a miner believes that the cheap coin has better potential, it's cheaper to mine the expensive coin, sell it, and buy the cheap coin.

I know, I was just voicing my opinion on BCC's so-called replay protection.
My point is that there is no replay protection, but they designed their system so that only the miners are able to reclaim coins locked in Segwit transactions, the common user is not able to join the coin bonanza. 
I guess that it's a way to incentivize more miners to mine BCC.

To begin with, the court will ask for proof - there's no way he can get away with 'I have those keys, just take my word for it'. Even if he was able to prove that he is in possession of Satoshi's key, most of those patents are unenforceable because they were first released as open source code.

I agree that it's a gray area. We often say that code is law, but in a court of law, actual law is law.

You're not forced to do anything. Protocol is law in crypto, and the BCC people are free to use any protocol they want. It might be unethical but it is not stealing.

Are the 2MB upgrade and Segwit pushed at the same time? Or segwit first then 2MB? Can't we signal segwit2x, get segwit, and later tell miners to shove it by ignoring the 2MB increase ?
I'm not hostile to a 2MB hard-fork, as long as the code is properly reviewed and tested, which may not be the case here. And I am afraid of setting a precedent where the miners can force an upgrade without the community's consensus. From a political POV, if it happens once then it is likely to happen again.

The network determines that you're transaction Z, not you.


I have provided the digitally signed public keys associated with these three unspent **utxis** ,   and **the following utxos.**
*(With Segwit, your signature would be on a different piece of paper within the same envelope.)*


No IP address is recorded.


You don't specify the transaction fee. It is implied as the difference between the input(s) amount and the output(s) amount. And the miner is not forced the claim the fee, although that would be dumb.


You don't specify the change address as a change address. It's just one of the address to which you attach new utxos. The fact that you own this utxos does not make it special compared to the other utxos.

Gold is not supposed to beat the SP500 because gold is an inert asset that produces no value, its interest lies as a hedge against inflation. It **is** value, it is not an value producing asset.

The tragedy of the common arguments does not hold when blocks are full.
At 2MB, blocks would still be full and fees would still be high. Total fees at  blocks could arguably be higher than they currently are.
Bigger blocks mean bigger total fees, and smaller fees per transaction. Unfortunately, it also means more centralization. But as long as blocks are full I am not afraid that fees will be insufficient.

He's made some contributions to the world but this is one thing I dislike about him, saying that Bitcoin is 'just' hashcash with inflation control (it's on his twitter btw). Sure. And cars are just horse carriages with engines. And trebuchets are just catapults with counterweights ( /s on this one ).

@_date: 2019-05-11 03:31:52
By hide I mean make it unseizable, not untraceable. With proper opsec, it's hard to seize Bitcoin without the consent of the owner. On top of this if privacy features ever make it to Bitcoin it's going to be very difficult to even track bitcoins.
It's not easy to hide large quantity of cash by the way. First you have to pay the inflation tax. Second dollar notes change regularly, so it's not easy to spend them after a while. If you were to spend a large amount of 1980s dollars you'd probably raise all kind of red flags.
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:00:46
I guess that law enforcement / intelligence community are having a similar problem. They are not underfunded but it's getting increasingly expensive to build tools to track transactions;  they have to keep track of hundreds of coins each with its own peculiarities / architecture, and  new coins created every day. And it's not like crypto developpers come a dime a dozen.

I agree that you can't have significant scaling on-chain, but I am just asking about the technical issues here, not the political ones.
