They dont need to track it they just have to look at your behavior.  For example if you work at starbucks and drive a lambo its time for an audit.

Good thing you are in Canada, that's the kind of post I would be searching for when I'm working for divorce attorneys.  I'll remember this for next time I'm helping out on a nasty divorce.  Thanks!

Same thing.  They claimed hack and they were the ones who stole it.  I'm just saying that there is no regulation and nobody to cry to when someone steals your stuff.

Irs is going to come down hard this year and hodlers that swapped into different alts are going to need to sell to pay the tax man.  Well at least in the us.  We will see a lot of selling 4.15.18.

Let's be honest, with a thousand cryptos there has to be a bit of a cleansing for the whole system to succeed, that's just natural selection.  I just want to know how to profit from that situation.

Bank robber steals from your bank, fdic hands you back your $100,000.  They steal or "hack" your coins, who do you cry to?  Is North Korea gonna cut you a check?
