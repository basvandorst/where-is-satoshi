I'm an engineer so no, I don't care what happens.

Why the hell would someone lie about working in tech?
I'm doubting you even have an education.

Enlighten me, which groups are still backing bitcoin projects? Which are actively seeking to fund bitcoin projects? What up and coming projects are going to make an impact on the community?
Hmm, can't list any can you? This is the best part of being a spectator vs an investor. From my vantage point, I don't feel the need to grab onto the smallest flakes of good news and blow them out of proportion. I can asses the situation without bias. Bitcoin is tiny, volatile, and heavily manipulated by the whales.
While you small fry's fight to secure 1 or 2 bitcoin, the big guys are laughing it up at your expense. You're a fool if you don't realize bitcoin is just like the dollar in that sense. You're being taken for a ride champ.

Not even trying to defend yourself. Great tactic.
Given how fast you reply, I'm beginning to doubt you even have a job. How's the WiFi in mom's basement?

I don't understand if you're being sarcastic or serious. But the quality of comments and lack of delusional bitcoiners on YC is far greater than r/bitcoin.

I still don't understand, nobody commented on a post 6.5 years ago and you're taking that as complete dismissal of bitcoin on YC's part?
I read bitcoin related threads on there whenever they popup, the comments are usually from people who like the technology but consider it too early to get involved with.
The average YC user is a Computer Science/Engineering grad. They likely "get" bitcoin more than any of the idiots here who read a couple circlejerk threads and swear by the price ticker.

What? No it's not. Bitcoin lacks so many of those features xcsler made.
Advocates should accept that bitcoin was never meant to become what it has. It grew too fast while still in its infancy and now any crucial changes are scrutinized or outright impossible to execute by the developers because people have become too invested.
Bitcoin put digital currency on the radar. It proved that digital money is superior but where it fails a new, superior, truly perfect currency will rise from the ashes. Bitcoin needs to die, it's too big to fix without people losing their shit.
**Edit**: Unsurprising, downvotes from the delusional believers. Have fun riding this sinking ship to the bottom because speaking as someone in the industry, the VC money has all but stopped going to bitcoin related projects. No new business in the ecosystem means stagnation and eventually the bubble pops.

Damn, you really think that I'm on your level. I'm a firmware engineer in SF. You probably couldn't afford the rent for my walk-in closet lol.
What a sad little man, good luck with your life.

This is hilarious, you dildos are turning on one of the few people who give a shit about the project. Do you have any idea the kind of stress involved in managing a billion dollar piece of software?
Gavin has been with bitcoin longer than most of you, he's done more for bitcoin than all of you, and yet you act like he owes you something.
If you don't like it, feel free to fork yourself; that is if you have any ability to program.
