Keep in mind many of these people here are horny neckbeard nerds who havent learned respect for women yet, let alone ever had sex with anyone but themself.

For the record I think vbenes advice is solid for those wanting to enter somewhat conservatively. However,I remain on the sidelines for the time being.

I believe there is some major underlying bad news that hasnt surfaced yet. Just a guess but some major holders are likely selling off. Usually when something hits bottom there is a capitulating low which is a drastic drop where people lose all hope, say F it and sell, followed by a rapid spike back up in price, the true bottom comes and goes in the blink of an eye. With btc every small rise gets sold back down and we hover near the lows which tell me there are more declines to come. All just my thoughts, nobody knows for sure.

Wow the upvotes. People here actually believe this?

Sorry I dont want tips or support change tip. I think it's spammy. Thank you though.
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:21:44
Will have to do better than that to impress me, sorry. I did the same things and didnt have to take anything out of cold storage. It was all easily done through traditional means. Oh yeah when the CC company calls you to confirm a transaction you dont have to jump through any hoops, it can all be verified in a brief conversation. Nice try though bud, come back when you can bring some true consumer side benefits to the table. I like bitcoin but i am a realist.

And you sound like a clueless child. Credit card companies only call when a possible fraud alert is triggered. If you use your card all the time they wont bother you but if you put it away and pull it out every 6 months to spend $1500 and buy a TV yes they will call, takes an extra 30 secs to verify and move on. A charge shows up from
China yes they will call. Get hacked and people buy things on your card? Youre 100% not liable. Bitcoin cannot compare yet which is why mainstream says no thanks. People like you with bad credit and/or just entering adulthood dont understand true financial power so you cling to bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-20 01:26:46
You're truly clueless. I use a credit/debit card probably 2000 times per year and have only had 4-5 cases of fraudulent use in my life. It's not possible to have a reasonable discussion with a koolaid drinker so I won't bother.

Now that the republicans control the house and senate the democrats will propose far left policies they know wont pass. Repubs have been doing the same thing for years while the dems were in control. Its a dog and pony show to make it appear they are doing something and cater to their party

So annoying if a facebook friend sent me $1. Maybe be more selective and send $50 to a few friends who you think may come on board rather than spam everyone
@_date: 2015-01-19 00:25:26
Imagine this DB thinks he's doing something productive by sending $1 to 50 "friends" lol. I'm sure they think you are an annoying DB

The investigator is asking for help from you who is asking for help from a reddit forum. Sounds like a shitty investigator. I'm no attorney but wouldnt the case be built around the fact that bitcoin was an asset which was stolen by someone else? All of the other questions you have would be brought to light in trial by expert witnesses that are called to testify and are subject to cross examination. This post really makes no sense to me unless there is an alterior motive. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:28:38
Starting but we wont see that until under $100
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:03:44
I hope for all of that to happen but I have major doubts. It's easy to type an opinion online but it reality it isnt happening. At 6 yrs old bitcoin technology is rapidly becoming dated. Things like pending hardforks and security/confidence issues do not help the cause. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 12:41:56
You can't go deeper than a few comments these days without seeing "hodler" and "troll". Are most of the people here 16-20 years old? Serious question.

If I had a nicklfor everytime I read $32 to $2 today, I would have a btc. Wasnt volume a sliver of what we are at now? If so it's a meaningless comparison imo.

Meaningless internet tough-guyness IMO. Somebody writes an article you disagree with and the neckbeards go nuts lol.

Sure and show us you bought them at $370

Im sick of people crying about trolls in every post. Think about your post, let's say bitcoin is $1 and all 27 million have been mined, that's 27 million dollars. Do you really envision some elaborate and functioning market of side chains being built off that piddly value? Side chains are to advance the technology without doing hardforks to the bitcoin code, but bitcoin would first have to have a substanstial value for people to want to brach out and build upon. If bitcoin is $1 it's done for, nobody will be thinking about side chains. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:16:15
The fact that "nothing has changed" is a flaw imo. For example, the looming blocksize hard fork debate is going to be a mess and turn off a lot of people. In reality the chinese buyer is out of the market and that hysteria is what caused the bubble (not gox). We wont see those price levels or enthusiastic buying again without the chinese herd in the market.
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:42:43
maybe early adopters who mined from pennies flocking to get out
@_date: 2015-01-18 20:52:39
I think its called a fad or a way to pump bitcoin in hopes of getting rich by btc value rising
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:15:53
tl dr cheap coins!
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:27:46
Based on this post my guess would be OP owns 1 btc maybe 10. No way 100.
You should never just buy once, always leave room to buy more. If you own 10 from $370 you should probably buy 1 or 2 more right now then dont look at it for 24 hours and see where the price is tomorrow. If we are down more buy another 1 and repeat the process until you lower your average cost. Then if the price rises a little you wont be down as much. If the price rises a lot you can sell a couple to get back to the core amount of btc you want to hold.
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:32:34
Thanks but I dont know if it has to be aol easy, but how about circle or coinbase easy? The main problem with bitcoin (imo) is that it is ill-advised to store significant btc with anyone unless you control the private key. If this is truly the technology of the future (which remains to be seen) you cant expect users to print little codes out on paper and/or roll dice or plug something into a usb port, sorry that just wont work in reality. We need some sort of cloud or simplified security, perhaps COIN could be the answer but the lower the btc price goes the less likely COIN will happen (imo)
@_date: 2015-01-24 02:04:47
Nothing new that accepting bitcoin is good for merchants that convert instantly to fiat, the problem with growth is on the consumer side. At this time, there are rarely advantages to buying with btc but commonly disadvantages. (Please dont tell me about the unbanked in africa and how that is the future) The reality is, living in the civilized world buying, selling, storing, and moving money around is pretty safe and easy, especially when compared to bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:27:42
Or maybe the jig is finally up and early adopters are selling out.

Of course youre not from the US. End of discussion.

Count me as part of the minority that thinks all changetip does is annoy people. Not only is it annoying and spammy to see in the comments, the whole micro tipping fad is not that useful imo. Sure  i get it may bring a few new people to bitcoin but so do a lot of things. Isnt the whole purpose of bitcoin to be decentralized and peer to peer? Wouldnt the best way to receive tips be to have a QR code and people send btc directly to it? I dont get why having a middle man (seeking to make a profit) in my transaction is a good thing.
