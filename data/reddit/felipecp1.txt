Fiat is not air. Fiat is just a currency with no ballast(coverage) anymore, that you use by forced imprint by government who can print money using just a button.  
By that and many others thinks bitcoin has your unique value.
To finish: money has value, but not the real market value that should have
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:52:25
Can someone explain to me what is this ?
@_date: 2019-12-10 19:18:15
@_date: 2019-12-23 17:30:23

@_date: 2019-12-07 18:02:32

@_date: 2019-12-09 18:55:02

@_date: 2019-12-11 09:23:50
@_date: 2019-12-10 20:52:18
It’s better buy btc and hold
@_date: 2019-12-10 21:03:44
Uoll! Something interesting! But first! One day they will sleep rich and wake up poor duo volatility

@_date: 2019-12-02 18:37:47
@_date: 2019-12-09 18:18:17
How i do all this things ? My btc fractions are in an exchange and i recently bought a hardware wallet! It’s safer to transfer from exchange to hardware directly ? Or i  have to creat an electrum account and  transfer exchange-electrum-hardware ?
@_date: 2019-12-09 18:55:07
@_date: 2019-12-09 19:46:44
