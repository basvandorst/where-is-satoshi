A better question may be, if people don't use bitcoin as a currency does it provide enough utility to justify the price?    
Savings, remittance, and proof of ownership prove it can do what cash can't.  
The people spending bitcoin right now are probably people who believe in the system. If the price were to drop it would not effect their spending habits.

During the Great Depression, Pepsi gained popularity following the introduction in 1936 of a 12-ounce bottle. With a radio advertising campaign featuring the jingle "Pepsi-Cola hits the spot / Twelve full ounces, that's a lot / Twice as much for a nickel, too / Pepsi-Cola is the drink for you", arranged in such a way that the jingle never ends. Pepsi encouraged price-watching consumers to switch, obliquely referring to the Coca-Cola standard of 6.5 ounces per bottle for the price of five cents (a nickel), instead of the 12 ounces Pepsi sold at the same price.[6] Coming at a time of economic crisis, the campaign succeeded in boosting Pepsi's status. From 1936 to 1938, Pepsi-Cola's profits doubled.[7]

Eat their shorts!
@_date: 2019-08-23 21:46:34
Ha. Yeah.    
  
This all assumes you have a linked bank account. Also, other variables may apply that I don't know....age of account, level of CB, etc,   
  
----------------  
  
Basically, when CBP sees that your CB USD wallet is larger than your available balance in CB then CBP will not allow the access/transfer of *any* of the funds in your CB USD wallet. (Not even the "available balance" part) CBP says Hold: Processing.  
  
But in CB, if you can  *somehow* get your CB USD wallet amount below the "Available balance" in CB, then CBP will allow the access/transfer of anything below "Available balance". I believe this is the case with USDC as well...if you get that wallet below "available balance" it will transfer, otherwise it wont.  
  
With prior knowledge of this situation there may be a better strategy 
 than what I did...like transferring funds from the bank in smaller chunks.     
  
My solution:
  
1)  In CB make your USD wallet below your "available balance" amount. One way to do this is to buy enough USDC in CB to reduce the funds in your CB USD wallet so that the CB USD wallet is less than the "available balance" in CB.
2) In CBP access your CB USD wallet and deposit into CBP.  
  
3) Buy Bitcoin with CBP.
3) In CBP, transfer said BTC from CBP to CB. This will increase your available balance in CB. 
4) Repeat: In CB fill your USD wallet bellow your new "available balance" and run through this again. With the one caveat being that you are limited in the amount of BTC you can withdraw from CBP to increase your CB wallet. That is why it would be better to initially move small chunks over...but I'm not sure how that effects available balance in CB and buying power.

Hey guys, I think I figured out the problem with some instant USD transfers to Coin Base Pro
----------  
The CB USD wallet you want to send to CB Pro needs to be less than or equal to Available Balance in CB.
Processing Time and holds will be encountered in CB Pro if the USD wallet is greater than Available balance.
1) Move funds to USDC wallet until USD wallet is less than available balance.
2) In CB Pro pull funds and buy BTC.
3) Transfer said BTC to CB to increase your available balance.
4) repeat (Till maxed out of withdraw limit on CB Pro)

Just keep track of price you buy and price you sell. Any transactions from BTC to USD/shitcoins/products are considered sales for now. Use a consistent method like first in first out or last in last out or select lots and all is gravy.

It's nice to hear such an honest reply, especially after you were  called a bot.  
  
But, the technology is much more advanced than legacy systems. I believe everyone will use the bitcoin network in the future whether they know it or not. Why would a bank invest in creating a network that already existes at a nominal charge? If it don't make cents, it don't make dollars.
Bitcoin is here to stay. Fight it, it gets stronger. Deny it, it goes elsewhere.  
  
The fact that it exposes the corruption that runs deep in the upper echelons is why it is here to stay and why it will be a tough fight.

But seriously  
"Heracles lured the Hydra out into the open and set about chopping off the first head, then diverting the creature so that Iolaus could cauterize the wound with a hot iron. "  
      
"Using a powerful sword given to him by the goddess Athena, Heracles then hacked off the immortal head and quickly buried it, piling rocks on top of the makeshift grave."

That's how I see it.  
Bitcoin created an "arms race" for efficient computing like nothing before.    
  
Previously, energy efficient goods/services/networks/properties were seen a passive way to save money and help the environment slightly. (Excluding actual energy generation - wind/solar/hydro) 
  
Bitcoin mining changed that, energy efficient computing actively makes money.   
  
Although mining will flock towards the cheapest source of energy regardless of source, like coal. It still "incentives" alternative energy sources in many ways. One way that is often overlooked is the use Bitcoin as a quasi battery for energy farms that are not feasible to tie into the grid.

Touché. I added an edit to reflect your comments. I don't want to be a source of misinformation. I want to talk geopolitics, but I am not the brightest tool in the shed, so I want to hear the communities thoughts. 
  
My thoughts of this discussion were more along the line of how we could be using bitcoin's tractability to provide accountability. Save lives. Billions worth of weapons and USD always seem to just vanish. I guess my quasi lib-tard idealism thinks we can  hold administrations/dictatorships responsible for war crimes committed with the weapons they sell to war lords. But they will probably just suicide anyone who questions their authority.

Wow. Thanks. Kinda scary. We all know how U.S. military equipment somehow finds a way to be used against the U.S. 
  
But wouldn't it be traceable to crypto forensics? I guess they plan to tumble and dump anonymously though another coin? Maybe I can make a quick buck off the arming of foreign militants too if I buy the right coin and sell in time.  
  
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:33:34
I know. I would hate to be helping him spread FUD. And I do not agree with ANY price predictions because there are so many factors at play.  
  
I believe he said China was releasing restrictions on withdraws and thought people would pull out. That is an assumption that I don't think anyone can know. I think it's pure speculation. Even if it happened it would be offset by unknown news and buys.  
  
But the trump dump of weapons is very concerning, regardless of bitcoin.
    
Lets not shoot the messenger.
The way I see it, if someone really did have some inside info they wanted to share and we treated them as hucksters because we didn't like the info then I feel that is equally reprehensible. This sub used to be filled with FUD and everyone is doing a great job shooting that shit down. On the flip side, pumping seems to be more acceptable, because we are all excited and passionate about the tech. Obviously, this is the place for that, and historically it has been true.  
But the dude called the tip top of the rally. I'm a little green here, but I have never seen that. Dude called the news on Kik. He could be trying to pump another coin, or he could just want to let the world know the US helping to create another banana republic.

Yep. If you are here reading this you are ahead of the curve. Also, since it takes time to get money into Bitcoin it's my anecdotal opinion bull runs have a little lag...or pre run first.  
  
Basically: It took me a few months to research bitcoin and assure myself you weren't all scammers in on a big con. Price went up. Then it took me weeks to get my funds to an exchange. Price went up. Then I had buy limits on exchanges. Price went up. 
  
Now, it is much easier to get money into bitcoin so there might no be as much of a lag....but you still have the "wait for the dip" people who will tell themselves it was just 3k so it's worth 3k. Maybe.......but 3k was BEFORE you could go to a supermarket and insta buy on coinstar...fuck. Times are changing.

Do more research so you can answer these questions yourself. Most people here believe that it's very, very useful and it's way under valued. Also the amount of interest in bitcoin and the infrastructures surrounding bitcoin are at unprecedented levels. Mix that in with a favorable government outlook and you can see why the price is going up. And if you look at the history of bitcoin, these are not "bubbles" because they don't pop. They actually end up 10x higher. It's just price discovery.

Yeah, when splitting gas/food with people who don't have cash.  
Unfortunately for them that was theoretical. They were paid cash a couple months later. Today they would have an extra 1k. (Almost)  
  
They are interested now. And not because of the price. But because they are amazed at how easy it is to take payments online. And they have more faith in the system. A system that has matured a lot in these few months. 
But it's possible everything can go to shit just as quick. So take caution.

There is a lot going on this week in the Bitcoin world. Hearings yesterday and today may bolster it's legitimacy to more people. Lots of news following new highs. And (some think) it takes a a week or more before people can feel comfortable with Bitcoin and then navigate the system.

It's risky. But could be rewarding. The down side is 0 the up side is 10,000 or more. Right now is a turning point after a large drop that could be an opportunity to buy...or a dead cat bounce that will correct again. So look into the technology and how it works and make the decision yourself based on research...you'll fell much better about it that way. Listen to your gut.  
Get started setting up accounts at exchanges and getting verified and read read read. You'll know what to do soon enough.

Not the best way. Your computer and operating system could be compromised. Search for Paper Wallet how to and you'll find some good info. Basically, you need to download ubuntu and put it on a live cd, download  bitaddress.org and put it on a fresh USB drive. Then disconnect your computer from the internet. Boot off the CD, Load the  bitaddress.org from the USB and generate a "wallet"...which is actually two  keys. Write down the matching private and public keys. Quadruple check the keys, and keep in a safe place or two. Then in coinbase send the coins to that public address. Done. Latter, if you want to spend/move any of those coins, you need to make sure you move them all....because if you try to move only 1/2 then the other 1/2 will be lost as "change""  
Hope that helps. It's not complicated once you do it once.

If the USA tries to stifle this economy then bitcoin will flourish elsewhere and eventually overcome USA's financial power. I bet it's here to stay. 
I predict that they will try to regulate your bitcoin wallet just like a bank account. I think they will also deal with taxes on purchases made in BTC.

Sadly, it's taking food right out of the mouth of their thoroughbred racing horses. Think of their children's children!

Do you think this builds more support at a higher level? Shaking the tree and providing a foothold so we can move up to all time highs?
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:46:15
I can't argue with that. But like 3D printer stocks, people are pricing in future expectations. They see higher value in it because lots of VC is pouring in daily from entrepreneurs trying to make it more useful and accessible.

You were right!  Twas a bit of hyperbole on my part to calm the panic. I'm happier with this price actually. A needed correction like we saw at 250 and 390. The market breaths. The weak gasp.

Yeah because when you import you enter your private key as proof that you own the public key...and the public key become known/compromised. Because of this you always need to import the whole amount in the wallet and not a portion of it.  Otherwise the rest is sent to a "Change" address and lost.
I don't understand colliding either. But it takes about 10 mins to find a block multiply that by 2^107 (a huge number with many zeros). Didn't calculate it but I'd say it's more than a 100 quadrillion years to find a collision.

Yeah I laughed. Too complex? Terrorist! The reply...now lets hear from the real experts.

YaHoos please stay scared so I can buy more evil useless BitCoins.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:13:29
Yeah a couple weeks ago. That first week is painful.

 Stupid political bumper stickers now accepting donations.

Well I would probably keep it also. It's worth the 300 bucks if you want it as a souvenir and conversation starter.

Thank you! I thought that was the worst name until you explained it. A nightingale would make a nice logo. And while I am critiquing, they should switch to CBX and drop the camp.

An interesting topic. Fines=justice? Because justice=profit for many. HSBC.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:48:14
Yep. Second test of the bottom at around 525. Shook off some week hands. Took some profit at 900 because everyone will be taking it at 1000. Now we can move on. Oh look we're almost back.

His shallow arguments are void. Why waste time and money villainizing early adapters of a dubious technology? Someone wants cheap coins. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:11:16
They will honor the price on the high risk sale...just email them and give them time to respond. But I feel your pain.

Yes day to day it looks like a stock. But...[it's a technology that could also follow a set rate of adoption](  
  


@_date: 2013-11-20 19:14:18
If I buy a friend coins at cost will this cause trouble?

Yep. They are hitting bottom but could position themselves as the leader in Bitcoin transactions because of their brick and mortar presence.

But they are looking. [The director of product for Western Union is wearing a Bitcoin button at money2020](

Bitcoin is more than a market.
