You have no evidence they are not vaporware; they burned through a third of their investors money paying lawyers and being friendly with regulators, that leaves a lot less to pay actual engineers.

They didn't do a great job with Aaron Swartz.
Odd to see all the people who hate "centralization" rally behind MIT one of the top 10 largest government contractors and its new group run by a former White House staffer.
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:46:49
But that's still not evidence that their product doesn't suck or barely even exist. No company ever did something amazing by paying lawyers. Allaire has spent millions on paper....not ideas, not inventions, legal documents. It's just not enough to make a real business.  
They have to hope and pray that the money they have left over is enough to actually invent something useful or market something useful. It takes zero skill, intelligence or foresight to spend money on compliance.

Buttcoin people are mentally ill violent assholes they bring nothing to this sub and those who impersonate people, make threats or continually troll should be banned. 
They can go back to their hate festival they call comedy. (Including this very post which a mod calls "hilarious"; yes impersonating someone else and making an extortion attempt is "hilarious". This in the same posts that try to distance themselves from it.)

Who is responsible for the ban and on what grounds exactly?
Is this done by a mod, if so, who?
Is it done in relation to some sort of Reddit corporate policy?
I think "fraud" is a bit of a strong word and the calls of people asking to ruin his life (not to mention make it almost impossible for him to work in Bitcoin) with a Federal felony are a little much ... over $10.
Uncouth, brazen, loud, poorly thought out and perhaps stupid, sure.  But it's very clear that his intent was simply expose this issue, not for the purpose of stealing.

Nothing wrong with not having technical knowledge - there are many skills needed in this industry.
Problem with her is that she is a complete bullshitter who not only doesn't know shit about blockchain she doesn't know shit about government which is supposed to be her field.  Her appearances before regulators are an embarrassment and she is actively harming the companies and holders with her naive pushing for regulation.

He really doesn't seem to have made much, if any, effort to integrate into Bitcoin.  How he made the Coindesk list at all is befuddling.
He rarely attends community conferences and there isn't even much evidence he has much knowledge about or even interest in Bitcoin.
He also has attempted to be some sort of leader or figurehead and has tried (and usually failed) at attempting everything from running development to conferences to patent protection to tech standards to the utterly horrible Blockchain Alliance which partners with the TSA and others.
As if all this wasn't enough, he was a tech advisor to Obama, based on Snowden's whistleblowing, is likely the very worst person in the US in terms of invading the privacy of people.
On his best day he isn't remotely close to Joi Ito's level.  He doesn't even make the top 100 in Bitcoin, if not for the underserved MIT position he wouldn't be in the top 1000 and probably would not even own a coin.
@_date: 2016-02-10 18:51:48
It's the strangest thing in the world that these companies would support such a horrible strategy.
CoinCenter is literally proactively asking for MORE regulation and has proactively partnered with agencies like the TSA/DHS and ICE.
CoinCenter is basically a marketing vehicle to increase the billable hours of Atty Weinstein.

He's no doubt a big deal on the college campus but your group might consider distancing yourselves from him and not listening to his advice.  He has little to no respect in the real Bitcoin world and is continually burning bridges.

Yeah, who, like I said, prob knows a lot about regs and nothing about Bitcoin

But do you see how the way you posted this comes off?
Why not work with the board and fix it as you were elected to to?
What did you accomplish by the nuclear option?
Why couldn't you have calmly come on and said "fellas, the foundation is running low on cash and Patrick has a plan I'm not a fan of and here is why".
You have supporters and so do the other 7 or however many board members there are.  If they outvote you on something are you going to do this again?  It's like being in parliament/ even if you don't like the other members you need to work with them or nothing will get done.
You care about bitcoin/ so do all the board members and every member. Just please think things through next time. You reflect on all of us now and this doesn't seem useful.  
I can't imagine how the board will ever trust you or want to work with you again after this.  You will be lucky if anything gets done in your term.  You can try to come to reddit with disagreements and get them to change with that pressure but they have thier own support and there is no big chance that will be good working.
Any fool can smash stuff. It takes a real leader to build things and make freinds from enemies and cooperate.

Olivier this post is in response to your accusations.
You used the word bankruptcy and that is a specific legal term.   Now you are saying "almost bankruptcy".
You also said 90% were fired which is a specific number.
Now you come in and rebutt with claims that things like specific legal terms don't matter.
Honestly it sounds like you just fly off the handle in an irrational way.  
Last year when you resigned you practically accused a board member of being a child mollestor which proved to be totally false.  This is the most nasty of allegations.
You then said Mark Karpeles tried to have someone killed which was also false.
You then said you were resigning from the foundation which you didn't.  
Then you made a pr show and offered 100,000$ to replace the foundation with a system you could never get working properly.
Then you ran for office and won only to immediately try to destroy the organization you just ran for election in and and took private board conversations and ran ahead of the report release to get reddit upvotes.
The foundation was pretty upfront about its financial challenges for anyone who had been paying attention (which you were not because it was in your fake resignation mode) you presented the post last week as it if was some type of whistleblowing when in reality it seems it was just routine info on bad finances presented in the worse light because you were mad you didn't get everyone to vote tour way.
Seriously what is your game on this?  It seems childish, not well thought out and not helpful to Bitcoin.   Edit: typo
@_date: 2015-04-03 20:04:57
Some people are making this overly complex --- 
Simple 
1) download mycelium wallet on your phone -- hit "receive" or show the qr code or text it to customer for payment
2) once you have those Bitcoin keep the, save the, spend them at places who accept Bitcoin or sell them on an exchange or buy gyft cards -- when you get a lot on there come back here and ask about higher level security practices like cold storage 
@_date: 2015-04-03 20:03:10
To make it less transactional you can always also send or text the Bitcoin address to the customer beforehand.   If it's a regular customer they will teust you and simply pay -- if it's a newcomer he can have the address already when he arrives and hit send when he feels comfortable -- ding your phone announces it was received.   Very simple and frictionless

Problem is they are inexperienced and thier ego outweighs thier knowledge.   They had no experience in investments prior to this and are totally disconnected from the Bitcoin space....they have attended perhaps three or so conferences and no one knows them.
They don't see the type to get advice.  Likely they are paying a small fortune to some old school NY law firms who don't understand the tech, while they themselves don't understsnd financial markets.
Someone like Silbert understands the markets deeply.
@_date: 2015-04-03 20:05:48
Meaning they can't explain it to regulators as well etc 
@_date: 2015-04-04 22:56:07
As a board member your main role is to hire and fire staff.
If you don't like Patrick's direction you make a motion to replace him and either the elected board members agree with you or not.
Are you advocating no executive director at all?
No need to go nuclear.
