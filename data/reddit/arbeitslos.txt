OK. That settles the discussion for now. BitPay is our gateway to average Joe. Here's my take on how to deal with what some people find confusing: 
     Technical Colloquial Definition
     1 MBTC    ?          1 000 000          BTC
     1  BTC    1 bitcoin          1          BTC
     1 mBTC    ?                  0.001      BTC
     1 µBTC    1 bit              0.000001   BTC
     ?         1 satoshi          0.00000001 BTC

There are two known security risks:
1. A flaw in the random number generator (combined with a well-known weakness in DSA) as explain in post. This has happened before.
2. A potential flaw in EC crypto. Making one transaction publishes the public key. Now, if EC is broken, someone could potentially derive the private key. Such a flaw is not known.

You have a point, but I'm still sceptical.
100 times up means roughly US$100k per BTC. Just one year ago, everyone on reddit could have realistically bought one BTC. Not only were they cheap, also all the infrastructure (mtgox, bitstamp, localbitcoins) was available. Sure, it wasn't easy, I know, I tried, but it wasn't cocket science, either.
I just don't see the average redditor suddenly having this amount of (fiat) money out of nothing. I perceive the world around me as fairly stable. I know, people in this sub have a different opinion. For my gut feeling, this should not work out.
@_date: 2014-02-17 23:02:00
Well, I get your point.
However, consider that bitcoins are, by design, online. So, going online is not an extra step. Now, why don't you do everything online? Because you want to deal with cash, which is inherently offline.
Other ATM designs don't require an online account, they are more typical kiosks, but they don't necessarily offer an easier workflow for the customer. So, me thinks, this thing has potential. (I can't really think of a superior mode of operation. Log-in with your localbitcoin credentials at the ATM: Risky. Send coins from cellphone to ATM: Awkward one hour wait for confirmations.)

OK. I'll have to ask since I don't know:
How does Coinbase learn that you were involved with gambling? Even if a user sents directly from (his wallet on) the gambling site to (his wallet at) coinbase, would this be so obvious that _have_ to act upon the info? Do those sites use a well known and obvious address such as 1POKER123456789?
Or did coinbase perform (some slightly more sophisticated) blockchain analysis? And, why?
I understand, they cannot the break the law and they probably don't want to be associated with things that can be considered illegal. That's fine, but why would they make an effort to identify gambling users?
@_date: 2014-02-23 22:59:38

Isn't this obvious? A physical coin representing 1 bit is "1 bit coin", totally different from the digitial "1 bitcoin", which must never be referred to as "BitCoin" or virtual.
This is one of the valid points in this discussion. Also if bits is the new base unit poeple, will add a prefix:
SI prefixes:
    1 kbit = 1mBTC
    1 Mbit = 1BTC
    1 cbit = 1 satoshi
    1 mbit = 0.1 satoshi
montary/numeric/anglo-saxon prefixes:
    1m bit = 1 million bit = 1 BTC = 1000 mBTC
Confusing as hell.

@_date: 2014-01-06 12:56:13
I'll try an easier answer.
It's not wrong to post a donation address and use it multiple times. The downsides are:
* Everyone can see how many donations you have received, which may or may not be what you want.
* It's relatively easy to identify your donors (if they don't take precautions), which could hurt them.
* You have a slightly higher risk of loosing your funds if your wallet software is buggy/insecure (e.g. RNG issue on Android [solved]).
Nevertheless, this is quite common.
If you want to avoid reusing addresses, blockchain.info and possibly other websites can generate a donate button, which produces a new address each time and forwards the funds to your address. Of course, if you run your own server, you can implement something similar yourself. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:56:43

Just a note: I like the idea, but double-spends are possible. The customer could send a second transaction from their cellphone while handing over the paper wallet.

So, I can sell and buy, which is great, but who is the counter-party? Will you connect to an exchange, will you match buy and sell orders or somehow connect with localbitcoin users?
When I want to sell bitcoin, I basically, go a website and buy a fiat voucher? How does the ATM know the voucher is valid when it's offline? Is the voucher code a cryptographically signed message?
What if the code doesn't work? How will you sort out complaints? What if some malware on my computer/network steels the voucher? I won't the voucher was stolen and you won't know that I haven't withdrawn my fiat already. How are we going to settle the dispute?
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:40:26

* As a user, I don't know whether you are scanning pakm veins, fingerprints or color of the skin. So, I'm suspicious.
* There may be not database of palm veins (never heard of them), yet, but you are creating one. No good.
* One form of ID must suffice. If someone steals my driver's license, drops it near a crime scene, may I'm fucked. But this is a problem with how law enforcement works. Carrying two forms of ID, just in case one gets stolen, is not going to help.
* The vein scan is a good idea, if it makes things easier, e.g. you can enforce daily limits if you have to, without asking for ID. Still, sort of anonymous. If it's also quick and painless, some people with prefer this to registering with proper ID.

Yes. Investing is a gamble. Some investments are high risks. Sometimes risk takers are rewarded with high returns.
The hypothetical redditor considered buying bitcoin (and many did) in early 2013 knew exactly, it was a gamble; all or nothing. Either bitcoin takes off or it doesn't. Either large payout or you loose everything. Those who invested in early 2013 got lucky and deserve their payout (whether they cash out or hold).
So far, bitcoin may have made a few individuals modestly wealthy. This happens all the time. Entrepreneurs, stock market investors, hard-working employees can make s small fortune. This happens all the time. It's stabilizes society, because everyone can dream of making it one day. (Lottery or Casinos have a similar function, albeit not a good investment strategy.)
If the bitcoin rally continues at the pace suggested, we are looking at a revolution, effectively putting those with big pockets in fiat out of power. This is not happening.

Yes, you are right. There's no incentive for a consumer (shopping domestically) to use bitcoin if other means of payment are available, feasible and free. (They are some perks, however, such as anonymity. Or near instant payments, which could speed up the process.)
It will take time for the ciclejerk to understand.
Its up to vendors to offer incentives (or bitcoin will not be widely used). The latter does not mean that bitcoins fails, not at all. Day to day purchases is only one of many possible applications for bitcoin.

One of the problems is time. I believe, CC/paypal transactions can be reversed a long time after the fact, like 6 months. So, the coins would be in limbo for quite some time.

Yes, it is. You can import private keys into Mycelium by scanning a QR code. However, I believe there is no simple scan+sweep.


Should be a feasible software upgrade. (OK, plus a camera to scan QR codes.)
Since using an ATM requires trust in any case, I'm not sure printing paper wallets is a problem. (Sure, they could keep a copy of your private key and steel your funds later, but they could also eat your fiat and 'crash'.)

No. Don't advertize this "feature". There are better ways to achieve this. You are misleading people.
Having said that. The app is interesting. It's nice way to hide a paper/brain wallet in your home, on your reasonably secure computer/phone/HDD. If the image is private (not something you downloaded from the web), it has sufficient entropy.
Yes, you can totally share an image (=key) between different trusted parties, but emailing images (=private keys) is not a clever way of sending money. It's dumb way of sending private keys. (At least, include a password communicated on the phone: "The picture of the cat, I sent you. Her name is ...") It is totally doable for mail providers to scan all incoming messages for pictures containing bitcoin keys. (Calculating SHA-256 and checking blockchain.info is relatively cheap, comparable to spam filters or displaying relevant ads. Nice side project for a bored intern. If your app gets feature on a major tech blog, you'll be secure for about two weeks.)

With Bitcoin, the customer can prove, they paid. The blockchain records the time of payment and amount. (Only useful if the customer gets an invoice that specifies the amount and bitcoin address.) You cannot do this with cash (unless you get someone to sign a receipt).
Also, the customer has full control over the Bitcoin transaction. If I send you 1BTC, I give up exactly 1BTC. If I give you my credit card number, you can charge as much as you want, whenever you want. I have to monitor my statement, file a dispute with my bank, hope they won't freeze my card or cancel my account for being a high risk customer...

It depends where you live and what you are comfortable with.
Localbitcoins involves trading with strangers, either IR or online. Exchanges require wiring money to a different country (usually), the exchange website may not be available in your native language (unless you are from an English speaking country) and may be governed by a different legal system.
For the average Joe this is an issue. The actual steps may be simple (scan your ID, wait, SEPA, wait, paper wallet), but in each step you are faced with stuff you are not familiar with.

This is a consequence of German tax code. Since Bitcoin is not regulated as an investment in Germany, capital gains tax does not apply, and, hence the gains are tax-free if the asset is kept for one year minimum.
Actually, the situation in Germany and Poland looks very similar to me. Both states do not regulate Bitcoin and try to find out how to fit it into the regulation landscape.

The overview on bitcoin.org is a good start, also bitcoin.it has some details on most wallets.


Well, maybe.
First, it is possible to import coins without making a transaction. No fees. However, some wallets treat import keys different from the ones they generate themselfs and, thus, you miss some features (essentially simple backup by memorizing a passphrase).
It is also possible to send old ('high priority') coins without a fee.
Besides, the standard fee is usually insignificant. What is 0.0001 BTC?

It's bit more complicated, but in effect, yes. A business, which buys and sells goods (or bitcoin), would appear to 'pay' VAT in both cases (as in VAT will show up on both invoices), but claim the money back from IRS after providing proof that VAT was already paid. An individual or small business would probably be either exempt from VAT or pay 'difference-VAT', that is the VAT on their gains.

Maybe. No one really knows. Breaking Public Key crypto has technological consequences. Socially, maybe we got to used to being spied on by then.


Not at all.
Quantum computing is an umbrella term, for a number of ideas, which are relevant mostly academically. There's only a small number of algorithms, which could be practically interesting. I'd say Quantum key distribution (already feasible), Shor (factoring, relevant for breaking public key crypto, not feasible yet), reverse database search.
Quantum computing is not a magic brute force machine cracking everything. Quantum computers can for very specific problems scale better (and, therefore outperform) than classical computers. 


How long a QC would take to break RSA (or well ECDSA), we don't know. However, if you have a quantum computer and a classical one, both taking, say 1 year, to break a 1024 bit key, and you increase the key size, then, the quantum computer would takes less time on the larger key compared to the classical one.

Linux Mint is a Debian/Ubuntu derivative. The default way to install stuff on those distributions is online via APT. You the tell system that you want to use a package called truecrypt and the system finds it for you online in the so-called repository (a webserver containing all Mint packages).
In principle, you can use a CD/DVD/HDD as a repository, but, generally about 10 years ago people gave up making complete DVD distributions with **all** packages because the online method is much more convenient.
Back to truecrypt. You can just execute the setup file you found inside the .tar.gz like a windows installer. If double-click doesn't work on Mint (not sure), try
    ./truecrypt-7.1a-setup-x64
on the command line (Terminal app). This is not the standard procedure in a modern (online) Linux environment, but it should work for Trucrypt. HTH

~~Can you expand? I understand that chipcard + PIN can be used in a BIP32 manner. The chip stores an encrypted key. Is this how it's done?~~
How does the chipcard work internally? Does it store an encrypted private key?
Follow-up questions:
* How can I recover the coins if I loose the card?
* If someone find my debit card (and learns my PIN code), the loss is limited to 50 EUR or so (unless they can prove I acted outright stupid such as writing down the PIN in an **obvious** way.). What if a scammer gets my coinkite card (and PIN if applicable)?
* Can I use this online without a card reader?
* Does the card reader decrypt the key or is the chip smart enough to sign the transaction itself?

You can. Just go to blockchain.info and copy/past the address you sent the coins to. You can find this both from your online and your offline wallet.
This does not put your coins at risk. The address (with a leading 1) is public information. Only the keys (usually leading 5) are secret.
However, you do give up some privacy by using blockchain.info because you reveal that you are *interested* in the balance of this address, which usually means, it's your address. 


Me, too. I have a text file with my public addresses for this reason.

I totally understand the frustration about the learning curve, but, why not?
1. Sign up for localbitcoins (instant)
2. Choose national bank transfer (or SEPA or international wire if you can)
3. Get your coins after 1-3 business days. No verification needed.
Kraken/bitstamp require verification ontop of this, but only once.
Yes, buying bitcoins is a hassle for new users and this is a barrier of entry that we should get rid of, but you can do it.
Also, as others said: Secure storage is also hassle at first. You need isolation from internet and, yet, you need offsite backup. Not simple, but once you found your way, it can be very simple, such as: Print three copies of a paper wallet, put two of them in envelopes and give to trusted third parties, bank vault, ...

Well, i don't know anything about chrome extensions, but potentially a closed-source (or obfuscated) app could, for example:
* Replace all bitcoin addresses on all websites with addresses owned by the developer. (Probably stupid. However, if they only replace addresses asking for anonymous donations, who would know?)
* Try to read private keys from other clients and steal the coins.
* Trick the user into downloading malware to do so.
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:54:11
If all this money is sitting on a single address (at a single output), you can send it for the minimum fee, 0.0001 BTC, or without a fee (if the transaction is high priority). 
If this comes from multiple addresses, the transaction is large and the default fee is 0.0001 BTC per kB: 
Some wallets will use higher fees -- for no good reason.
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:25:52


Or open multiple accounts with different banks. There are a number of free checking accounts. So, you can use Fidor for Bitcoin, Sparkasse if you need a local branch, DAB/consors/whateverDirect/... for investments, ... you get the idea. If one screws up, you already have a backup account for your daily business.

Do you happen to know, which exchange rate and fees those machines use? Do they automatically restock coins via an exchange?

No, the logic is different (I assume, IANAL and not from Norway):
If you buy a pizza with cash, this is one taxable purchase. Say the Pizza is $10, VAT is 25%, this makes $2.50 for the taxman. 
However, if you trade a pizza for a tuna sandwhich, those are two taxable events. You are buying a pizza *and* selling a sandwich. Both are worth $10. The taxman gets $2.50 twice. This sound ridiculous, but it is the norm.
Appearantly, bitcoins are sandwiches in Norway.

Yes. The vendor should have a return policy that states so. (In some places this is required by law.) Alternatively, a trusted third-party (bitpay, paypal, some escrow) could take this role. (Same as for cash or CC purchases just without the safety net that the CC bylaws provide.)


This is an open question. Again, should be clear in the return policy. Both options are reasonable. Both are risky for both parties.

Honestly, I don't know. However, if the coins have been sitting at this address for a while, chances are, you can send them without a fee. Just try. You'll get 1 out of 3 outcomes:
* Transactions goes through. Fine
* Wallet asks you to include a fee, which you can deny or accept.
* The transactions does propagate across the network and will not be included in a block. In this case, the coins are (practically) returned to yourself (within 24 hours). You still can resend with a fee. [You cannot loose your coins this way. However, it may appear as if you had lost your coins. Be careful and don't panic!]
