The involuntary transfer of purchasing power through constant inflation is fully integrated as "necessary" in mainstream economics, and apparently 90-95% of "cash" is already electronic and therefore traceable and siezeable.  Essentially they've already won.  From a macroeconomic view, it's diminishing returns for the remaining few percent.
I think most of the remaining push for going digital is the banks trying to improve their bottom line, as they make higher margins on digital transactions.
And there's no need to mix the realities of economic oppression with vague theological mysticism.

If the "other side" of your channel closes it, at least they pay the tx fee for that, right?
Still, it would suck to have to re-open randomly, so I guess you'd want to be picky about who you have channels with.
Maybe there is (or could be) a way to "checkpoint" the channel, i.e., commit the state to the blockchain but leave it open, or close and re-open it with one on-chain tx.

Most of what banks do that's detrimental to everyone else is still practical in a Bitcoin economy.  They would still take risks with other people's money and expect to dodge the consequences, those actions would just have somewhat different, disastrous outcomes.

I think routing is going to be an ongoing area of improvement, presumably taking lessons from BGP and OSPF.  The "standard" way to find a route in a network is A*, or Dijkstra's Algorithm if you can't build a heuristic.  The key is the cost function which is usually an aggregate rather than something simple like distance or latency.  That is, it finds the "lowest cost" path ("shortest" is misleading) where cost is a complex metric that may have little to do with the number of nodes and, e.g., might go out of its way to visit an extra negative-fee node.
If the cost function is something like (a / latency + b * liquidity + c / fee + ...), when you minimize that function over the network you're getting some balance between those factors, where you're minimizing latency and fee while maximizing liquidity, but the relative importance of one over the other is the, e.g.,  a/b ratio (depending on units) and can be tweaked as needed.


I think there's a distinction between a tendency and a *requirement* for everything to route through a few nodes.  A "whale" might create a node with very many well-funded channels and a zero- or even negative-fee policy that would tend to draw all traffic through it.  So long as the rest of the network is reasonably well connected and funded without that node, though, what harm does that do?
So we might talk about topographical centralization of the network itself versus centralization among the actual routes chosen by various clients as two separate measures.  We can't see the latter, though, so it would have to be a simulation from a snapshot of the network state with various assumptions.

Big banks are members of the Federal Reserve, but they don't control it.  It's chartered by congress and the leadership appointed by the president.  Banks would actually prefer less inflation, as inflation favors borrowers.
If the financial industry has proved one thing, it's that they are incredibly creative at finding ways to "extract value" from complex markets.  Don't think for a moment that when confronted with Bitcoin, they would just give up and go home; they would find some way to make boatloads of money at *someone's* expense.
A bank would still be able to create "instruments" like the CDSs and CDOs that led to the housing crisis and bond markets worth more than the commodity on which they're based.  If these products are denominated in Bitcoin it would cause deflation, as a fixed amount of Bitcoin is used to value more and more instruments.
And despite the fact that they can't create new Bitcoin, they would still be able to do leveraged, fractional reserve lending using off-chain markets.  So long as people are willing to accept their debt obligations, they can keep playing the same games.
Everyone seems to know that the big banks can't be trusted, but each new round of evidence to that effect fails to cause a mass exodus to smaller banks and credit unions.  Most people, despite knowing better, still trust the banks with their money; from savings and checking to retirement funds, college funds, and mortgages.  I can only imagine it's a lack of understanding of what's going on and what one can do about it, coupled with a denial that the system is really so corrupt.  Apparently things are going to have to get really, *really* bad before people acknowledge how badly they're being fucked over.

I think I see what you mean, when you say connected you mean that they *could be* connected via a TCP connection; logically vs. physically connected.  That is, a TOR node can be instructed to connect to any other node with a routing, where a LN node can only be instructed to use a node to which it already has an established relationship.
I'm a little skeptical about the difference, though.  There will be a lot more possible TOR routes for any given number of nodes, but it doesn't change the fundamental topology, you just need more LN nodes and channels to achieve the same level of connectivity.

The Bitcoin userbase isn't giving Coinbase power out of generosity, but rather exchanging it for convenience.  You can't expect people to go out of their way to uphold vague ideals like decentralization, at least not now that Bitcoin has grown past a tiny group of "true believers."  The central idea is that people behave in their own interests and respond to incentives, after all.
It's only natural that the company able to serve the users most effectively ends up with a lot of power implicit in their role, but it's also natural that they get complacent/arrogant/whatever, and create opportunities for others to take their place.

We don't have to pick the shortest path, though.
It seems to me that the "centralization" of the network depends on the amount you want to send.
I'm envisioning a chart where the x-axis is the BTC amount being sent and the y-axis is the number of paths (above some arbitrary length) which could route that amount.  Either between two specific nodes, or a mean of values for many nodes, etc..
We can expect that for tiny values there are a huge number of paths available (like n-factorial) but it quickly falls to just a few as the value increases, probably with an exponential decay distribution.  If we set some threshold like needing at least 10 routing options and call that decentralized, then we can find the value below which the network has that property, but above that does not.

They can't accept GBP deposits directly, it says so prominently on the UK deposit instructions.  After failing to read those instructions, you went through several info and confirmation screens titled "Deposit EUR" and proceeded to deposit GBP instead.
Those funds don't go directly into their account and it requires some kind of bank paperwork to resolve or even return the funds, presumably with a second fee.  And they could reasonably charge you another fee for fucking it up in the first place and creating useless work for them.
Sure, it sounds like they could have handled it better.  "The customer is always right," they say, but I can tell you first-hand that a rude customer pissed off about their own mistake is never going to get the best possible customer service.

There was some talk about crypto/crypto trades falling under 1031 "like kind" rules, but the IRS never clarified and that's being changed to include only real estate anyway.
It's unlikely that the IRS would ever see trades within an exchange, though.  If they go after anyone, it will be because of fiat bank transfers.  A lot of people are giving up on any hope of reporting all their exchange trades, and just paying taxes on the net outcome.

Construct a device containing a small computer which uses some source of entropy (e.g., a hall-effect sensor, photodiode) to generate a random key, encodes that onto a set of physical indicators inside the device which can only be read by destroying it, and encodes the public key equivalent onto another set that's visible from the outside.

There is a small downside to mining more transactions, which is the probability of someone beating you to a block because of the few extra milliseconds spent constructing the block or transmitting it.  
300k of 1 sat/B tx is like $20, but losing out on a block will cost you about $85,000.  So that probability has to be less than 1 in 4000 or so if those tx are to be included.

That's debatable, and you're going to far by stating it as a fact.  The American Institute of CPAs requested clarification on this point from the IRS (in 2016) and received no answer.
The definition of a 1031 exchange explicitly excludes "Stocks, bonds, or notes", and "Other securities", which could be taken to include cryptos as they are generally treated as securities for tax purposes.  If you're going to do this, be prepared to defend it.
Also, this is a common type of fraud, so any questionable use seems likely to raise red flags.

Generally, yes.  Each word known reduces the search space by some factor, expotentially compounding with each additional word.  But it's always a matter of balancing effort with potential cost.
If you know the order, leaving only 8 words makes it pretty easy to crack.  If not, you'd need to do that for each possible ordering.  You could also include "decoy" seed fragments that you somehow know to ignore, or any other system which adds lots of extra work for an attacker.

No, it's a little like Darwinian evolution in that sense; those who object fundamentally miss the point, and in many cases its an intentional refusal to understand due to some ideological hangup.
Even many of the comments in this post miss the point.  Bitcoin is a tool, and is very good at a specific set of things.  Some of those things it does better than anything else.  Would it be a "good idea" to replace all [Physical Currency, Virtual Currency, Payment Networks, ...] with Bitcoin?  Of course not, but that's not what Bitcoin is about.  Bitcoin is about enabling revolutionary things that have never been possible, and replacing obsolete systems is just a side-effect.
Most of the common criticisms are like people in the 90s saying that the Internet was a bad idea because it won't replace libraries as a means of accessing the world's knowledge, or that e-mail is a "bad idea" because it can never replace USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL, etc..  Other criticisms are along the lines of "email sucks because I hate Pine/Thunderbird/Hotmail," missing the forest (technology) for the trees (implementation).  People said the Internet was a waste of time and resources, and I find it hilarious that those would be the same people today using the Internet to say that Cryptocurrencies are a waste of time and resources, when they could very well be similarly revolutionary.
As far as I'm concerned, Bitcoin is still an experiment.  It's going reasonably well, but we've only explored a few of it's uses, and we can't even guess at what might be possible.  Why would anyone want other people to stop experimenting with new technology?  What are they afraid of?

See [irs.gov](  I'm not a tax lawyer.
You should give them an interest free loan because they will charge you the interest plus a fee otherwise.  The "normal" way is to have part of your paycheck withheld, so that they get their cut as soon as you get paid.  If you could be confident of a very good rate of return, it might be worth keeping that money throughout the year and paying the penalty, but we're talking about *selling* Bitcoin, after all...
Basically if you have a capital gain more of than a few percent of your normal yearly income, you will probably need to either adjust your withholding or pay quarterly:










As for when, the first quarter's estimated taxes are due the same day as the previous year's returns: postmarked by April 15.  Note the wording carefully, though:




I suspect the "generally" here means that if you send it on April 15 and they get it a week later, they *can* still charge you a penalty if they want to.
Also note that they don't care if you make the capital gains sale on Dec. 31, you are still expected to have paid 1/4 of your estimated taxes for the year by the end of each quarter.

A few "small" 1MB transactions?  Only *Exactly one* fits today.
You're completely, entirely missing the point here:  the reason n^2 scaling is a problem is that a 2MB transaction is much slower than two 1MB transactions, and a 4MB transaction is much slower than two 2MB transactions, and *hundreds of times* slower than four 1MB transactions.  That's precisely what needs to be fixed.
 1 x 1MB | 30 seconds
 4 x 1MB | 2 minutes

A slippery slope argument asserts that a small step leads to a chain of events culminating in some negative effect.  I'm saying that a move to 2MB *immediately* makes it possible for miners to make only relatively powerful computers able to run nodes, and that a move to 4MB means anyone capable of mining a block can DOS the entire bitcoin system for hours.  That's not a vague series of unlikely events, it's demonstrated fact.
The anecdotal fallacy applies when someone tries to claim that their personal experience is meaningful evidence.  This isn't personal experience, this is an established fact, well known and agreed to be a problem (and, in fact, already solved) by the part of the Bitcoin community that knows shit about software.
Also, even if you insist that those apply despite all reason, [it doesn't change anything]( it's just an all too popular way to dismiss things you can't argue with effectively.


Waiting until it's a problem to find out how big a problem it is, and whether it can be fixed is, to be blunt, an incredibly stupid approach.  Like piling trash on your stove when your bin is full and saying "well, if there's a fire, I'm sure someone will figure out how to extinguish it."
This problem has been studied extensively, and a solution has been designed, implemented, and tested.  Why are you so adamantly against using it?  The alternative is to hand over more control of the system to miners, so that they can use it to increase their profits, and that's why miners are manipulating you into thinking it's necessary.
And this is just one example.  Perhaps more importantly, we don't know what other problems we may not have discovered yet, but we can be all but certain that they exist.

As I understand it, miners are seeing more profit from fees than in the past:  [
Is this basically short-term vs. long-term thinking?  I have to wonder if most of the miners are wondering how high the fee market can be pushed, and so aren't really interested in scaling as it will just cut into their profits, and it's only those miners who strongly believe there's a huge long-term upside who are willing to put aside some short-term profit.
I also have to wonder whether, if control of the block size were effectively handed over to miners, would they really allow it to grow, or would they contrive to keep it small in order keep fees high?
It seems to me that Bitcoin is being used at least as much as an investment instrument as for "digital cash" or a "settlement layer" combined.  In that context, several dollars per transaction is a low fee, and it *can* be pushed higher, potentially pricing out other uses completely.

I think the intent is that receivers would either have extremely poor internet access or no internet access at all.
With poor access, you could use it in the way you describe, and use your internet connection to send transactions.  I agree that this does not seem particularly useful.  Maintaining a full node isn't really useful, and in fact is considered bad for the network if you don't have good connectivity.  The only reason I can think of for this approach is a deep distrust of any "lite node" services.
With no connection, though, you could watch for transactions but not submit new ones.  For example, consider a vending machine.  It would need only a simple processor with little storage to watch an address for each item, and when it sees X amount flow into a particular address, dispense the item.  It doesn't need to verify everything from the beginning of the blockchain, since small amounts aren't worth attempting a double-spend, so there's no need to have gigabytes of storage for the entire blockchain, just a few recent blocks and transactions.

The attack is possible, one example proves it.  That's no logical fallacy.
It's not happening all the time because nobody's figured out how to profit from it.  If the system can be exploited for profit, someone will do it.  If it can be used to grief/troll people, someone will do that too, if it's not too expensive.  Right now, it's merely a small annoyance, but at around the 2MB mark, it goes from a annoyance to a major problem.
Miners are free to ignore transactions like that, and hopefully they all do, but a malicious miner could include such transactions in every block they mine.
In software, you don't ignore attack vectors just because nobody's figured out how to exploit them yet.

Well, I wasn't trying to start yet another block size argument, I was mostly pondering why neither of the major scaling approaches seems to be very popular with miners, and if we have an counterproductive incentive problem.
On that topic, though, the one thing about Bitcoin that seems really crazy to me is the idea that every transaction, whether it's a real estate sale or a $1 wallet reorganization, has to be kept track of *forever* by everyone participating in the system at the node level.  Even if bandwidth and storage were unlimited, it just seems wasteful.
Imagine if any site participating in sending emails around the internet had to archive an encrypted copy of every email that had ever been sent by anyone, anywhere.  That function would have quickly centralized, the cost of email would have become prohibitive, and it would have died in the 90s in favor of some more practical solution.
And if I understand you correctly we're agreeing here: until we abstract user-level transactions from block-level transactions, Bitcoin simply can not practically scale to billions of people.

As a node, you can arbitrarily limit transactions accepted into the *mempool*.  If a miner produces a block with that transaction, you can't just ignore it, though, or you're on another (dead end) fork.  We sure as hell don't want a potential fork every time a block is produced and miners decide whether or not to accept it based on its contents.
Why do you have such a vocal opinion on this matter, when it's clear that you have zero knowledge about how Bitcoin works, or software in general, anyway?

The example I'm specifically aware of is that a particular "pathological" transaction can be created in a 1MB block that requires about 30 seconds of CPU time to validate on each node, but with 2MB that time goes to around 10 minutes.
Obviously, spending 10 minutes validating a block that comes in about every 10 minutes is problematic, and slow systems would be completely unable to function as nodes.
If you consider sizes larger than 2MB, it's completely unworkable without fixing the O( n^2 ) problem.

If bigger blocks is what people wanted, why not fork to the simplest practical change which enables bigger blocks?  But there is, or rather *seems to be*, a lot of support for introducing a new mechanism which changes the balance of power in the ecosystem, but has never been tested under adversarial conditions (or tested much at all, apparently).
That makes it clear that simply "bigger blocks" will not satisfy a certain group, so one has to wonder: what is the real goal, if not just bigger blocks?

Right, this is like using the number of daily calls for a phone network, rather than the number of devices or users that can use the network.  Not only is it a different metric, but it changes the basic units by adding a "per day" value.
Metcalfe's law assumes the number of possible connections is asymptotically proportional to the square (or n log n) of the number of devices, but what is (tx/day)^2 == tx^2 / day^2 ?  If you have a time unit squared in a denominator, that makes it a rate of change in a rate, like acceleration.

I transferred more than a few Bitcoin out of MtGox literally one day before that became impossible. Two days ago, my scripts started reporting that the GDAX API was down right about the time it hit 1000, and I thought "oh shit, here we go again," but it was just a minor hiccup.
The infrastructure around Bitcoin is tremendously better developed today than it was last time around (though that's a really low bar), and exchange is much better diversified.  Markets aren't very rational, though, so I expect one major exchange going down completely would stall any growth for a while, if not start a sell-off.

If every Visa transaction in history had to be recorded forever in thousands of locations, Visa fees would be *much* larger, and it would never have become popular, rather it would long since have been crushed by another system without that onerous requirement.
The blockchain is not analogous to anything so far, and comparisons to such systems are of little value.  Comparing Bitcoin to Visa is like comparing a container ship to NASCAR.

Every exchange does most of their transactions off the blockchain.
And if Bitcoin is to fulfill even a tiny fraction of the financial services market, there will be companies which provide Bitcoin services to people without the ability or willingness to do it themselves, i.e., "Bitcoin banks," and those businesses will still be able to do stuff like this.
In this analogy, the blockchain is like the interbanking clearing protocol (see EBICS), which is already "secure" by conventional means; and manipulating that is not how banks pull their shenanigans.

By denominating transactions in BTC without any actual BTC backing them.  People accuse exchanges of doing it already.  The only problem is that it has to get started slowly.  Basically the loans have to be entirely on the bank's books, for example they can't lend Bitcoin for a real-estate sale where they have to actually transfer the Bitcoin to a private party.
So someone deposits 8 BTC, and someone else wants a loan for a property the bank owns through foreclosure, costing 2 BTC.  The bank approves the loan, effectively converting the value of the property into off-chain BTC, and now their books show that they have 10 BTC in deposits+debts.
This is pretty limited, though, so they would create BTC "debt tokens," where they could lend "BTC" for a property owned by a different bank, then give that bank a promissory note instead of the actual BTC.  Then banks start using that debt token instead of real BTC wherever they can because it's easier to move around, and has no transparency.  And now that you have a bunch of BTC debt on the books, GS can create a security out of it and trade it.
Of course, when they inevitably get too greedy and over-leverage, the Government can't just step in and print BTC to dig them out of their hole, and the people who thought they had deposits would be fucked.  So the banks would try to convince individuals to accept their BTC debt tokens instead of real BTC for, e.g., payroll.  Most people don't care that their USD are nothing more than debt tokens that can't be redeemed for anything today, so why would they care that their "BTC Dollars" can't be redeemed for BTC, so long as they can use them to pay their bills?
Cryptocurrency provides an alternative, one more practical than gold coins, that people *can* use as sound money, but people still have to choose to use it that way.  If your goal is to free the world of fractional-reserve lending, the only way to accomplish that is to educate an entire generation about the nature of money and get them to care enough to reject the debt-as-money system.  So long as the general public is complacent about it, the bankers will always find a way to make it work for them.

Fees are still pretty low, what makes you sure that people are being priced out?  I figure that if block space is cheap enough to fill with spam, it can't be that bad.
Bigger blocks shifts costs from transactors to node owners and miners.

Well, first let me reiterate OP's disclaimer that I'm not a lawyer nor acting as a CPA, and not giving you legal or tax advice.  
Short answer: yes, I believe so.
To be clear, your losses are not what the Bitcoin was worth when you lost them, or now, but what you paid for them originally.  So if you bought $4000 worth of bitcoin at $10/BTC, it went up to $300/BTC and then got hacked, your losses are $4000 as far as the IRS is concerned.
Anyway, you subtract your realized capital losses from your capital gains, and if the losses are greater than the gains, you subtract up to $3,000 / $1500 (single/mfj) of what's left from ordinary taxable income.  That is, capital losses always offset capital gains (lower tax rate) before ordinary income (higher tax rate).  I don't know of anything that would prevent you from applying $3K of that loss against your ordinary income and as much capital gains as you have.
Normally a "realized loss" means that you sold for a lower price than where you bought.  If you have a "write-off" loss because bitcoinbuilder was hacked or whatever, that probably counts but you would need to be able to substantiate it, and I'm not sure what would be required by the IRS.  Unless you got an affidavit or something that you're sure the IRS would accept as proof, I would definitely recommend a lawyer/tax advisor for this alone, if not for the rest.
So to be concrete, let's say that every year you have $5K in capital gains every year, you can apply $8K of your loss to your income for 15 years.  That will save you 18% of $5K and [your tax bracket]% of $3K each of those years.
If you're going to be getting money back, there is a time limit on amended returns; if you're going to amend 2014, you should have until early 2017 to do so, but I would file amendments for 2014 and 2015 before filing for 2016, else you'll probably have to amend 2016 as well.

I don't think the IRS would agree with that.  They're not interested in "if I had ..." scenarios, only what actually happened.  If no trade occurred, it's unrealized.


Yes, essentially.


3K of "normal" income for single or joint filing, no limit of capital gains, and capital gains must be covered first.


For personal taxes there's no time limit, it's just that in my scenario you would be using 8K per year which would last 15 years before reaching 8*15=120K total.  If you only used $3K/year (i.e., never had capital gains again) you could do it for 40 years, as far as I know.
@_date: 2016-12-02 02:28:30


There's some disagreement between different government agencies; e.g., FinCEN considers it money while the IRS considers it property; but the IRS is all that matters when it comes to taxes, and they've been pretty clear since 2014:


You can file an amendment to your federal tax return up to 3 years from the date you filed or two from when you paid, whichever is later.
Generally speaking, the IRS is a lot friendlier when you own up to a "mistake" than if they have to come after you for tax evasion.  In the end, they don't care why, so long as they get the money.
If you amend your tax returns and pay what you owe, with interest and penalties, you're probably better off than if you wait for the IRS to find you.  You'll also owe more interest the longer you wait.
State taxes, of course, are another matter.  Since federal tax paid is deductible from state income tax, multiple years of federal and state amendments can get pretty hairy.

My recommendation for dealing with a big price jump is to sell enough that you've already come out ahead, so that you can have no fear of the price dropping.  If you can eliminate the feeling of risk, it's easier to avoid emotion having any bearing on your decisions, and it's easy to hold and buy during "crashes" that have other people panicking.
And more generally, if you have enough liquidity on both sides, sell a little any time it's going up, and buy a little any time it's going down.  If there's one thing I've learned to rely on, it's fluctuation.

If you're thinking that you can just cool the system to an arbitrarily small temperature, that doesn't really work.  There isn't really any such thing as vacuum, and the ground state energy means there's a positive minimum energy for any system.  
Even if you could construct a computer at such a small temperature as to require a relatively small amount of energy for the computation, you would expend astronomical quantities of energy getting it to and keeping it at that minimum temperature.  The ideal temperature would be some balance between energy required for computation and energy required for maintaining that temperature.

To me, this is like complaining about ARPANET's NCP not being able to scale in 1982.  It's a problem, but a purely technical one that's less interesting than the core principle of distributed transactions with no trusted intermediary.
Personally I think the idea of using an immutable public ledger for minor transactions is silly, at least so long as every transaction is permanently recorded.  For now it's more like a trust-less version of inter-bank wire transfers against which it compares favorably, even at the worst levels of network congestion.
Also, sending value from one place to another securely is only the simplest use case.  The possibilities get a lot more interesting than that.

No, it's not practical at all, it's 100% tradition.  And it's disappearing, just much too slowly.
For one thing, an ounce of gold is an impractically large value, $35 is a much more useful denomination than $1100, and basically nobody carries or uses physical gold anyway.  The few people who actually do use [things like this]( denominated in grams.
For another, it's not even the same "ounces" that Americans and Brits are familiar with, it's a slightly different ounce, which is worse than yet another arbitrary unit.  Like giving distance in Nautical Miles.
And the metric system is in no way limited to large or small numbers.  If a gram is too small or large for what you're using, use a milligram, decagram, hectogram, or a kilogram, instead.  But instead of having to remember some arbitrary conversion factor like 16 ounces/pound or 700 grains/troy ounce, you just move the decimal point around, which even an idiot can manage.
It's one thing to argue the value of tradition, but claiming that the traditional system is in any way objectively better is nothing but irrational justification for being too stubborn to switch to an obviously superior system.

Well, it's more than a little complicated...
- When a debt is forgiven, that's normally counted as income
- An S-corp is a special entity whose income is counted on its owners' tax returns.
- An owner can also deduct losses from an S-corp, but only up to their "basis" - how much they put in (you can't deduct more than you risked, in theory)
- These losses can be used to offset gains for up to 20 years (to encourage business investment risk)
- S-corp losses that can't be claimed are "suspended" until they can be claimed
Putting these together, you might imagine the following scenario: you own an S-corp that goes bankrupt, while you personally remain solvent.  The S-corp holds debt that isn't guaranteed by you personally, and gets forgiven as part of the bankruptcy, and so has "income" in the form of forgiven debt.
So what happens?  Well, the law is ambiguous.  It was disputed, and the case went all the way to the supreme court (See [Gitlitz v. IRS, 2001]( which decided that the forgiven debt counts as basis in the S-corp, but does not count as taxable income.
So now I can answer the question: Trump set up Casinos as S-corps which then racked up debt by hiring contractors and not paying them, and declared bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy counts as a loss for the value of the assets, and their debt becomes basis for that loss, without the need to risk any but the investor's funds.
Trump wins, the investors, contractors, and taxpayers lose.  Trump can gain no more than about $250 million from the deal, but I suspect that the total cost to everyone else was a good deal higher, though I can't really say for sure.  Trump is certainly not the one one to take advantage of this gaping loophole, just the most notable.
Note that I'm not claiming that he set these casinos up specifically intending to make them fail, which one *might* argue would constitute fraud.  There's no evidence for that, it's just that casinos don't normally have any trouble whatsoever making money, which might lead you to think in that direction.

Declaring some transactions "bad" and trying to suppress them is the kind of thing we've come to expect from states.  Bitcoin transactions are not good or bad and the reason for a transaction is none of your business.
Someone decided it's worth their effort and Bitcoin, and that's their business. If you want to have the freedom of doing what you think is best, you should give others that same consideration.
If a certain class of transactions causes a problem for Bitcoin, then Bitcoin should become more resilient.  Calling them "spam" and "useless" serves no purpose.

Privilege covers a lot of ground; many communications are explicitly immune from defamation/slander/libel.  Some examples are exchanges between married couples, legislative debates, and judicial proceedings.
It would never get as far as deciding whether a form privilege applies, though.  The first problem you run into is that they would argue that, because you're not specifically, publicly named, you can't be defamed by it, and I think a judge would agree.
It also wouldn't pass other tests.  "Could reasonably be suspected" isn't really an accusation or a false statement of fact.  It's absolutely true that you "could be suspected," (i.e., they always suspect everyone) and "reasonable" is subjective.
It's an idiotic statement made by an asshole, but it's not defamation.

A hard fork means a change to the consensus code that leads to diverging blockchains.  SegWit is carefully designed not to diverge, using valid but "non-standard" transactions which are accepted in blocks by older code, though they are rejected from the mempool.

Why is it any of "our" business what people are doing?  People should be free to act within the rules of the Bitcoin system without judgement whether their transaction is "legitimate" or not.  We should leave aside value judgements.
If we want to "outlaw" a certain type of transaction, we should encode that into the consensus rules, hard fork, and make it literally impossible, short of making your own Bitcoin with hookers and blackjack.
If we want to *discourage* some behavior, then we should dis-incentivize it somehow.  People respond to incentives, not to judgement.
Beyond that, if you want to spend your fees making valid transactions, that's your business, and nobody can stop you, so why bother trying?
If people want to donate their Bitcoin to miners as a form of protest that Bitcoin isn't scaling fast enough, that's their prerogative.  If that clogs up the blockchain too much, we should fix Bitcoin, not complain about spam.

But that just means other people bought for $0.10, so they're only up a million percent, rather than ten million.  But sure, most of the Bitcoin being sold for $1000 has changed hands a few times on the way, and plenty of people bought high and sold low.
But then, some people definitely still have whole blocks of mining reward that cost a few cents for 50BTC.
For many long-time Bitcoiners, I think it's easy to hold more Bitcoin than you would be willing to buy, if you had its current value in cash, for some reason.  Especially if you've already sold enough to make 10-100x what you put into it, so that wherever it goes from here you really can't lose, and selling means you lose out on any hope of truly astronomical value.

"Solving" anything with bigger blocks is just asking someone else to subsidise your cost so you can compete more cheaply.  Why should they do that?
As far as I'm concerned, using Bitcoin for routine transactions is a sorry waste of its incredible potential.  Sending a few bucks 6 feet through a global p2p network with a *permanent* ledger that supports programmable transactions?  It's like asking for a mortgage paid by bank wire to cover your groceries.
And why should thousands of nodes, or anyone for that matter, have to keep track of your coffee purchase, *forever*, anyway?  
Imagine if every site that participated in email had to keep an encrypted copy of every email that had ever been sent to anyone, anywhere.  Or if every bank that issued a credit card had to keep track of every transaction made by any card, anywhere, forever.  The overhead would be enormous, and these systems simply wouldn't be used.  *Nothing* works that way that works for more than a few people, and for good reason.

They also don't care about TCP, UDP, DNS, BGP, TLS and the dozens other things that make the internet work.  End-users don't care *how* the problem is solved.  I think everyone can agree that Bitcoin will have to change.  And how it scales is less important than its broad properties.


I don't even know what you're talking about... who's preventing anyone from using Bitcoin?
I'm trying to figure out what your point is; first you imply that it's useless because "who would want to write an app" for it, but then you're defending the way it works "provides the most functionality and benefit".  It provides *no* functionality and benefit if nobody would use it.
And yes, it's silly.  The very thing that you claim "provides the most functionality and benefit" is precisely what prevents it from scaling to be useful for everyone.
Do you really think it makes good sense for all the nodes around the world to keep track of every little transaction, *forever*?  Not to mention inter-device microtransactions, other stuff we haven't even thought of yet, and pure spam.
Imagine if every organization who participated in email had to keep an encrypted copy of every email that was ever sent.  Email would have died in the 90s, or there would be one enormous, central repository for email, like the NSA's wet dream.  Or if every bank that issues credit cards had to keep track of every transaction that had ever happened on any card, anywhere, forever.  Transaction fees would be huge, there would be few cards issued, and basically nobody would use them.

Yes, you can definitely write off losses, it's just a question of how much and how many years you can carry over losses beyond that limit.  Note that losses count against your taxable income, not your tax liability (taxes owed), so each $1 in losses might save you something like $0.25, or whatever your rate is.
What made Trump's case unusual is that, through some manipulation of debt, he was able to carry those losses over much longer than most are allowed, applying the same losses to his tax returns for almost 20 years.

Much of the reason that development is slow is that the community is fragmented.  A lot of experimental stuff has been developed that ended up not being used, and developers get attacked for their hard work instead of praised.  Experimentation has its value, but in retrospect, most of that time could have been better spent.  That's an inevitable price for collaborative development.
In addition, development and deployment is intentionally slow to help avoid catastrophic problems.  There have been a lot of incremental improvements over the last few years, and a solid roadmap for more.  We're still in the very early days of Bitcoin, one hopes.
There's nothing stopping you from paying your rent in Bitcoin, save finding someone who will accept it, that's not a technical limitation.  You can buy games and socks with it, and you can send money around with a very low fee, if you're willing to wait behind people willing to pay more.  Technically you and a coffee shop can set up a payment channel today (bars call them "tabs").  I think the analogy to the early days of dial-up internet is a good one.
I mean, if Bitcoin isn't useful to you, don't use it.  If there's something better, you *should* use it instead.  But it sounds to me like you're too focused on minor stuff and missing the big picture.

Can you justify this from specific IRS regulations?

Even if you qualify to deduct it as you described, is there any situation where that be beneficial other than when you were going to donate $40k anyway?

Of course anything that a miner with 51% can do can also be done by a cabal of miners with 51% total.
However, 51% hashrate only gives you a small chance at an attack, and the resulting loss in reputation and reward value would likely outweigh any achievable gain.

Just thinking it through... by making abuse unprofitable, it should be possible to make the necessary amount of manual intervention relatively small.  I'm not sure a forfeitable deposit would even be needed.
Buyers would be verifying all the results manually anyway, so they would just need some way to indicate that a result tile was bogus.  They would still have to pay, but the fee would go to a different seller, without allowing the client to resend the scene, until the result was accepted.  That would make it unprofitable to cheat as a seller without opening up a loophole where buyers could get work done for free. I'm assuming all the requests are stateless and idempotent, of course.
Attackers could sign up as buyers and DOS the system by submitting many jobs and rejecting all results, so there would need to be some kind of rate-limiting and attack detection on that side as well, perhaps along with a reputation system that gradually increases their limits.

One thing I don't quite understand is why anyone would manufacture and sell ASICS at all.  If the unit is profitable, after paying a markup on its manufacturing cost, it would be still more profitable for the manufacturer to just run it themselves.  Essentially, if it makes sense to sell them it doesn't make sense to buy them, and *vice versa*.
I suppose the manufacturer is either trading more long-term profit for less short-term profit, i.e. to recoup R&amp;D costs faster, or betting that mining will become less profitable, while the buyer is betting it will become more profitable.
But AB adds a wrinkle; the larger the fraction of mining is done with AB the less advantage it gives, so it's actually beneficial to have plenty of non-AB competition.  The natural progression would be for it to inevitably take over all mining, but that would be self-defeating, so it needs to be artificially limited to maintain an advantage and profitability.

Yeah, it would be pretty easy to set up a server that bids out and then just immediately responds to any request with empty frames.  It's small enough amounts that it's unlikely to be attacked now except as an exercise, and there don't seem to be any clients anyway.  If it started to become popular, though, it would quickly be swamped by scammers and probably destroyed as a result after discouraging anyone interested in buying.
It seems like the seller needs to have something at stake like putting some BTC on deposit, with bids limited to some function of that amount, which is forfeit if they're found to be cheating.  There would probably me more complexity around preventing malicious behavior than the core functionality of selling work units.

It's really not fair to make any comparisons without specifying what kind of transactions you're talking about.
The fees are relatively fixed since transaction size has essentially nothing to do with value.  If you're moving around thousands of dollars at a time, especially between jurisdictions, it's great.  If you're trying to send a dollar to someone sitting across the table from you, not so much.  So yeah, not unlike a wire transfer.
Since fees are not percentage-based, there's *always* going to be a sliding scale, and larger transactions will always be cheaper, as a percentage, it's just a question of where the threshold of "practical" falls.  Some people insist that transactions on the order of $1 must be practical, others think it's $0.01, or $1000.
But there's a systemic cost for low fees paid by nodes, which is equivalent to the overhead that makes a bank charge $15 for wire transfers, but is difficult to account for directly.  Some people think nodes should bear that burden in order to maintain cheap, low-value transactions so that Bitcoin will grow into new markets, others are sure that it will result in many fewer nodes, thus centralization, and isn't worth whatever growth potential it provides.
@_date: 2017-04-12 19:39:38
I have to disagree that writing code is equivalent to "fighting," but that's semantics, I suppose.
As a developer of software myself (not Bitcoin), I can tell you that end-users rarely know what they want until you put it in front of them, because they rarely even know what's possible, much less what's practical or impractical, or understand any of the trade-offs being made.
Bitcoin, itself, is a pretty great example of this, actually, as is Linux.  Satoshi and Linus weren't catering to a demand, they were demonstrating a vision of what was possible and taking the hardest step of most journeys, the first one.
Each collection of developers in the Bitcoin sphere is developing (or in some cases, "tweaking") software to align with their vision of how Bitcoin should be.  Ideally users, be they miners, exchanges, holders, and/or node operators, each choose which of those visions most closely aligns with their own, and Bitcoin itself provides a consensus mechanism by which these are reconciled.  Most people seem to be satisfied with trusting a "proxy" to understand the complexities and make this decision for them, though.
If there is any "fighting" to be done, it's in disseminating the **facts** of how these alternatives work (not vague predictions of what might happen as a result) and combating the inevitable *dis*information and misunderstandings that arise.  Developers are, as a rule, more interested in code than documentation, though, and it's reasonable to leave this educational/outreach effort mostly to the rest of the community.
In reality, it seems everyone is eager to offer up their own predictions (centralization! the death of Bitcoin!), based on unspecified and often spurious assumptions, of what effect a given direction will have in the future.  Such predictions should be treated as more or less educated guesses, but are all too often promoted to facts by their corresponding community, even when they come from people with a poor track record at predicting the behavior of the Bitcoin community.  And really, the only way to avoid a poor track record of prediction in general is to keep one's mouth firmly shut.

I think you'd need to rely on an "expert witness" to testify as to whether it's possible at that time.
A simple plain-text document would be the most difficult to modify without being obvious, while something like a Word doc or a PDF could pretty easily hide a lot of junk needed to adjust its hash.

There really isn't all that much to it.  This is a good place to start:
The basic assumption is that the hashes are unpredictable and uniform so that, for N bits, there's always a 2^-N chance of getting any specific pattern.
We also assume that all miners are trying different nonces, but some of them may try the same values and thus not actually consider as many possibilities as they should.  However, without analyzing the particular methods used by each miner, we have no way of knowing how often this happens.

If you have considerable liquidity, the way to mitigate the risk is to ladder the transactions, e.g, transfer 10% of your holdings (or whatever), sell them at a 10% profit, 1% total, cash out, and repeat.  You make 1% every few days, which is ~100% APY, and at worst you lose 10%.  An arbitrage trader in traditional markets would kill for that kind of margin.

The patent means they can use government to enforce an artificial monopoly on the tech, at least within some jurisdiction.  To me, this seems antithetical to Bitcoin's basic ethos.
Once most miners are using it, the difficulty increase means it's probably impossible to be profitable without it.  And once it's ubiquitous (either from everyone switching to it, or some miners being forced out of business) there's no benefit to security of the network, quite the opposite if it causes centralization.

I've had an account there since Dec. 2012, and I had a few Bitcoin on deposit for a while when that wasn't worth much, withdrew it well before the MtGox fiasco, and haven't used it since.  
That it still exists is something, and the site is a lot more polished than it used to be, but I can't vouch for it beyond that.


You can't just get that rate on arbitrary deposits, it's a market.  You bid a rate, term, and amount, and if someone (another user) borrows it for margin trading then you get that rate.
They claim the risk is low because they enforce a maintenance margin, but I don't know what the risk is in practice.

Inflation is a tax on *savings*.  If you have low-interest debt and investments, inflation is actually beneficial.  That's one in a long list of reasons it's more expensive to be poor, and a big part of the way that the system is explicitly rigged to the benefit of the rich.
Now that most money is digital, there's really no limit to how much the money supply can be inflated and, as long as it happens slowly enough, the wealthy are protected from the negative effects.  The end of that is not from simply too much inflation, but when enough people realize how much they're being screwed and start eating the rich rather than protecting the *status quo* that keeps them poor.

There have been problems with SegWit, but that's to be expected, software without bugs simply doesn't happen.
If you're comparing, the issue is that one branch of the code has had a few significant problems with relatively few changes, while the other has had thousands of commits and just a few problems.  And perhaps more importantly, that former is not keeping up with the changes being made, and is basically sitting idle by comparison.
If someone wanted to run a node that accepts larger blocks, the smart thing to do would be to make a minor change to the current state of the core client.  Doing anything else signals a poor understanding of the entire situation, or simple manipulation.

Depends on how you're measuring "worse" I suppose.  You do have to put it to use, a little more work but you also have money, so I don't see how that's worse.  And at some point, you just hire someone to take care of it.
A mortgage is the classic example because you can get a low interest rate plus a tax deduction.  If you're lucky you can end up paying an effective rate about the same as inflation.  On top of that, The real value of the unpaid debt is going down and the value of the asset is increasing.
If you have credit card debt, you're going to be paying ~10% interest at best, and that completely outstrips the decreasing value of the debt and nothing you put on a credit card is going to be increasing in value over time.

He had no way to validate those, it's relatively trivial to make fake bank statements, etc., just edit the PDFs and print them out.  Going from seeing some documents to being "sure" of anything about their business is putting your reputation on the line and vouching for their trustworthiness.  That's fine, but when you put your reputation at risk, you pay the price when you're wrong.


Again, being sure of this was foolish and/or deceptive.  Even if he could be 100% sure about their fiat holdings, how could he know the extent of their liabilities?  "All the withdrawal problems" could reasonably be taken to mean that everyone could withdraw *all* their funds if the banks would just allow it, and we can't know whether that was true.


Why is he making promises for them that he can't deliver?  This sounds like MtGox marketing material that he's being paid to read for a camera and, again, clearly puts his credibility on the line for them.
His "apology" claims that everything he said before was true but, even if you take everything he said as generously as possible, with no implicit endorsement, that last quote above is still unequivocally false.  His "apology" then turns into a plug for his VC startups and ETH (before the DAO fiasco).  He just couldn't resist pushing his own self-interest while trying to clean up his previous mess, and it makes his apology even harder to take seriously.
He obviously regrets backing Gox, but he can't escape people's conclusion that he either was duped or sold out to help them scam people, and his backing now is the opposite of a reliable endorsement.  Especially now that he's completely reversed [his previous position]( in order to blatantly scam people with cloud mining.
It's pretty clear that his sole interest is his own bottom line.  If joining a cartel to try and forcibly take over Bitcoin doesn't work, it'll at least drive up the price of his ETH in the process and he'll come out ahead anyway.  Who cares what happens to Bitcoin, so long as he's a "successful businessman," that apparently proves him correct no matter what he says.

Unless it's your thing, like Warren Buffett, "Wealth Management" is typically left to professionals because it's a lot of work, and requires some skill.  Even Buffett has someone else doing the boring stuff and the paperwork, I'm sure.  
An aggressively-managed billionaire's assets are generally spread across so many different concerns in different jurisdictions that just planning out the tax implications of a potential investment takes multiple CPAs with different areas of expertise, and tax filing is effectively impossible for anyone but an experienced CPA who can devote many days to it.  A minor error in planning or filing could result in paying millions in taxes unnecessarily so aside from being a waste of time, it would be foolish to take this on yourself without expertise. 
Another thing a lot of people don't realize is that if you hire a "broker" they have no responsibility to act in your interests, but if you hire a "fiduciary," they are legally required to act in your interest.  The low-end broker market is a leech on the upper middle class, extracting billions from managed IRAs, 401ks, etc., while adding no value; they can be reliably outperformed by a computer algorithm.
There's a whole WM industry built up around maintaining the fortunes of HNWIs; Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, etc. make probably $50 Billion in revenue and manage many $Trillions in assets.  These companies compete for how quickly they can grow their clients' wealth, and if one got a reputation that they were taking advantage of their clients, or they started to average a *decrease* in wealth, they'd be out of business in a year.

There's a limit to the number of *coins* that are generated, around block 7 million with 21 million coins, but that doesn't mean blocks stop being generated.  At that point, there's no reward for generating blocks, so tx fees will be the only incentive to mine blocks.
Probably the coin rewards will become insignificant long before that, and fees will drive the network for the last few million blocks.  Remember that the final periods, the block reward will be 0.00000001, and before that 0.00000002, etc., so it will be insignificant for a long time.

In stock markets, a bucket shop is defined as anyone who takes trades but doesn't actually make a transaction for all of them on an exchange.  They can be combined, of course, but they all have to be represented.
I believe the quote is saying that, since they take orders any time but only process them once a day, the total result of the orders could be for buying or selling more BTC than are currently available at the end of the day, so they would end up having to buy from or sell to their own customers to cover the difference.
The way I read it, the lenders' deposits are only used for leveraged trading.  They could potentially borrow from this pool for the above scenario, but the result is the same because the order is not going to the exchange, it's being fulfilled out of funds controlled by the site.

The "bitwrk" part seems to be generic, it's just buying and selling work.  There's a blender-specific part that buys and sells blender tiles over bitwrk, which seems to be just a couple of Python scripts.  Someone would need to implement the render plugin and render slave parts for Max, and you could sell Max renders on the same market.
Unfortunately, a quick search seems to indicate that Max uses the repulsive OLE/COM protocol for automation.  There are various packages that would let one create the render plugin and slave scripts in Python, or whatever, but how much work that would be really depends on how well the Max API fits into this kind of workflow.

But the definition of "very small" changes.  The more successful Bitcoin is, the more "real" small transactions there will be, and the smaller they will be.  That is, unless you're in the "Bitcoin is a settlement network" camp, where success means something different.
It's difficult for the network to tell the difference between success and spam; that's mostly a subjective judgement.  Thus blocking spam without also blocking success is tricky, to put it mildly.  To begin with, it would help if we could even agree on what "spam" means.

I don't keep up with what's available for Python, but there's probably some git repos or something with useful code.  A quick search only turned up bindings for communicating with the standard bitcoin client and for running mining applications.
A mining app such as poclbm might have all the necessary functions to do the basic key/address transformations, verifications, etc., but I haven't looked at them in detail.
The brainwallet site is open-source, so you can see all the JS code on [their repo]( (most of it is minified on the site), and there are a few JS REPLs like Node.js and Rhino that would let you play with that code interactively.

No, of course not.  If you read what I quoted carefully, you'll see that it's speculation.  Without spending a bunch of time investigating the blockchain, I can't even be sure they've made any trades at all.
The point is that IF buy and sell orders are unbalanced during the day and IF, at the end of the day when they enter the day's trades, there aren't enough BTC on MtGox, BFX, or whatever, then they would have no choice.  They have no control over the BTC bid/ask volume on the exchanges, and not executing orders in real-time could back them into a corner.

According to?


Even if the USA "does not" have enough tax revenue to cover costs 15 years from now, that doesn't mean it "will not."  And still, it would only mean that spending has grown too much and must be reduced, one of the few things on which almost everyone agrees.  (Of course, it's *your* stuff that needs to be cut, not *mine.*)
Key to understanding this is the fact that $100 in long-term debt incurred today, of which say $80 remains unpaid in 2030, will be worth about $60 in today's dollars at that point.  The U.S. can buy *more stuff total* using debt than they could by having no debt and paying for everything directly, even when all the debt is eventually paid back.
You could do the same thing if you could convince a bank to lend you money at a rate below inflation. In fact, you can accomplish it with tax-exempt interest on a mortgage in some markets, if only just barely.

I understand the tech, but you don't seem to understand people.  If you got what I'm talking about, you would also get that the technical details are not in dispute, and not at all relevant to my point.
In a retail setting this, while technically possible as I said, is absolutely *not* practical:


From a customer's point of view, yes, the merchant has their money, because they just sent it.  You're presuming that they understand the tech, which is naive to the extreme.
In the meantime, they will yell at the cashier, the manager, other customers, and anyone who will listen, and then they'll tell everyone they know you tried to cheat them, even after you refund them.  That is the kind of thing that makes a business drop a payment method immediately, and tell everyone they know it's terrible.
Imagine you put up a sign that says you can't pay with $100 bills.  Use a giant sign with flashing lights if you like.  I guarantee that a few times a week, someone will hand the cashier a $100 bill anyway.  Now imagine the cashier says he can't change that, and won't give them the product *or his money*, but he'll give the money back sometime, probably within 10 or 20 minutes.  Absolutely unacceptable, you'd get customers literally calling the police.
When a customer inevitably sends an RBF transaction anyway, it's the same scenario.  Try to explain about transaction flags and how the customer fucked up all you like, it won't make a bit of difference, except maybe to get you fired.
And please, stop being such a fucking douche.

Technically, you're right, but you're talking about "settlement" and your own analogy shows how little anyone cares.  When you write a check no funds have moved, yet just about every store accepts checks in exchange for goods.  But try writing a check for a car or something, no way.  Same principle applies in Bitcoin.
A zero-conf transaction, without RBF enabled and with a reasonable fee, is at least as trustworthy as a check.  More so in one sense because it effectively ensures that the funds are available, since relays typically validate inputs.

To be fair, almost a third of that debt is owed by one part of the government to another, it's just bookkeeping.  And most of the rest is owed to Americans (companies, funds, pensions, private parties, etc.) in the form of bonds which are in the middle of being paid.
Even more importantly, by encouraging 2+% inflation but paying very little interest, the government is actually making money on that debt.  For the government, the national debt is not a crisis, it's a profit center.
And yes, that means that if you, your 401k, your pension, etc., are holding T-bills, savings bonds, etc., their value is growing more slowly than the purchasing power of the dollar is decreasing.  But you get "stability," while somewhat mitigating the theft of your purchasing power through inflation.
While the level of foreign debt is often overblown, Americans would actually be better off in purely monetary terms if there were *more* foreign debt, because it's essentially a way to export our inflation.

No current technology can handle the daily activity of the entire world, not by a long shot.  There are a lot of plans, plans are a dime a dozen so to speak, but none of them really matter until they are proven out.
Technology isn't developed by scaling up first, then handling demand.  Any tech design is matter of tradeoffs and whatever the mechanism, there will always be some kind of cost that comes with capacity.  It's impractical to ask current "early adopters" to pay that cost for hundreds or thousands of times the capacity currently needed, so such a design is unlikely to ever need that capacity.
Google didn't spend billions to build build dozens of datacenters worldwide in 2000 just in case they became a dominant global search provider.

One part of the narrative is that people fled BTC because of the fees, which is unprovable, but the implication is that they would switch to the low-fee Bitcoin, which is very clearly not the case.

It's true that [ECDSA only has effective entropy equivalent to half of the key size]( or 2^128 in this case.  So you might think of there being 2^128 private keys for each of the 2^128 public keys, more or less.
I assume 2^96 comes from 2^256 / 2^160 but I don't think that's right.  If something has 128 bits of entropy, running it through a 160-bit hash doesn't change that, it's still 128 bits.
There must be some old P2PK (pay-to-pubkey) outputs, but most outputs are P2PKH or P2SH now, where the private key, public key, nor address are what determines whether the funds can be spent, but rather the hash of the public key or script.  So really, you're indirectly guessing this hash value, and there are ~2^128 private keys which end up producing each of the ~2^128 possible RIPEMD-160 hashes, and ~2^32 hashes which are not produced by any private key.
So yeah, the correct value is only about half way down this chart.  But it's still equivalent to winning something like 3 or 4 different 1-in-a-billion lotteries at the same time, or flipping a coin and having it come up heads more than 100 times in a row.

That's a talking point originating, I think, from Roger Ver.  The math isn't wrong *per se* but it's based on some questionable assumptions and presented in a biased way.  For example, the assumption is that nothing changes as the userbase grows by several orders of magnitude (which is effectively his coin's ideology, though he would deny it).  To handle the same traffic, his preferred solution would need to have 10-20GB blocks every 10 minutes, and few of the systems or networks running the network today are capable of even a small fraction of that.
I suspect most Bitcoin supporters would be more than happy with the ~100M new users per year that implies, which is faster than any monetary system has ever grown in the past, and would certainly drive innovation.

I don't really keep up with the development of LN, but probably getting exchanges and processors to use channel factories instead of having everyone use it directly would be the first step.  I don't think anyone sane seriously expects to start seeing hundreds of thousands of new users per day sustained for years though, so I doubt there are any concrete plans for such a scenario.
Honestly Bitcoin and Lightning are still much too complicated for your average user, and relying on end-users to secure their own keys is a security nightmare.  The idea that direct use of Bitcoin/LN nodes, as opposed to people relying on exchanges and payment processors, is suddenly going to go "mainstream" is pure fantasy.

You're getting warmer, but no, that distinction doesn't even exist.
Bitcoin is not recursive.
Ethereum is recursive.  Ethereum is also "infinitely recursive," though that's redundant.
If you can loop once, you can loop twice, [and so on](  Looping and recursion constructs always boil down to a "goto," and you can always write something equivalent to "10 GOTO 10" in a Turing complete language.  You can try to analyze a program to detect that, but that's also been [proven]( to be impossible in the general case.
Perhaps if you had carefully read the [Ethereum whitepaper]( before trying to present yourself as knowledgeable, you could have avoided making so many embarrassingly faulty assertions:

The point is that the sequence exists within pi.  Knowing exactly *where* it exists is a separate concern.
If there's "illegal information" on a computer, it's not knowing the filename or inode which locates the file that's illegal, but the sequence of bits itself.
If there's any sense in which knowing the location of "illegal information" is illegal, that's in failing to report it to the appropriate authorities.

No, it isn't, because there's no way to "not accept" a transaction.  Transactions occur without any interaction from the receiver, as I'm sure you know.  If a "no RBF transactions" sign actually worked, then all would be fine.  But if you think that's practical, you've never worked in retail.
As a merchant you can say "no RBF" all you want, but you have to assume people don't know what that means or how to configure their wallet.  Some will inevitably send an RBF transaction anyway and you're effectively forced to accept it or refund them because, from their point of view, you already have their money.  A refund amounts to accepting it because making them wait for confirmation before a refund won't be any more acceptable.  So it's an unenforceable policy, and confuses honest customers while still allowing dishonest customers to cheat by "accidentally" using RBF and then getting irate about it.

So you're not going to "at least explain how it is possible"?  I'm shocked.  No, not really, without loop or recursion constructs, it's provably (in the mathematical sense) *not* possible.  I was hoping you'd at least make an entertaining attempt.
If you still think it is and you care about Bitcoin, you should spill the details to at least one of the client dev teams.  If Bitcoin script is Turing complete, it's possible (mathematically guaranteed) to write a never-ending script that will lock up every node in the world, and it needs to get fixed yesterday.
From what I've heard since, what they really mean is something else running on top of Bitcoin using block scripts as tape cells, which is like saying paper itself is Turing complete and is in no way impressive, unexpected, or novel.  In other words, this claim is misleading at best, almost certainly for the explicit purpose of attracting investment money deceitfully, which is fraud.

If 95% of mining power really switches, you'll be left with 200-minute blocks for up to 9 months, not that it would last that long.  But yeah, some of those miners are probably just bullshitting.
Nonetheless, it's the miners that determine what happens.  The best you can hope for is to sway their opinion, but it's essentially an economic decision, so hashtags aren't going to do much.
Assuming they do split, what's more important is the market price of each afterwards, because that determines what the mining power does next.

And the UTXO set is way down, [almost 20% in the six weeks](

If there are few pools and small miners have little or no choice, yes.  If there are "enough" pools representing different points of view, then small miners can switch at will to keep from adding hashpower to a pool that they feel is abusing it.  Pools are like representative democracy.

I'm not aware of any simplification that simple.  It fixes malleability, allows nodes to optionally prune away signatures, and perhaps most importantly attempts to shift the incentives from favoring growing the UTXO set toward reducing it instead, which is the real long-term scaling bottleneck; block size is really just a rate-limit on that scaling.  None of that is much like anything in the real world that I can think of, but it's also not so complex that it can't be understood without analogies.

If every miner switches, there is no split.  If non-miners don't, they stop seeing any valid blocks, and Bitcoin is dead for them.
If some miners don't switch, enough to actually find blocks on the old rules, then there's a chain split and non-miners have the choice of which chain to follow.
In either case, the desires of non-miners have no bearing on what happens.  The only thing you can do as a non-miner that will have any effect is buy enough coins on the old chain to keep it profitable, otherwise it will die.

Not a measure, a prerequisite.  You *must* have a way to execute an arbitrary number of instructions, or the machine *cannot* be Turing complete.  No exceptions.






Bitcoin script also does not allow for an infinite loop, and is guaranteed to halt, and is therefore not Turing complete.  And it still wouldn't be if it had a thousand stacks, or random-access memory.
This is super basic stuff.  Think about your two stacks for a moment; who's pushing and popping stuff on them?  How can that execute any arbitrary computation if its only [flow control]( is conditionals?
If you spent five minutes actually trying to write any of the most basic example programs like busy beaver or [Turing's original example]( you'd see that it literally cannot be done.  That's 100% by design, and a very good thing.

Right, someone will find the necessary value but no individual will "get" the block.  If you really want to get technical, it's the pool software, not the miner who finds the correct nonce to generate a hash below the target value, who actually constructs and broadcasts the block to the network.

Pretty much any cryptocurrency has that same basic utility, though, if not more; that's not what makes Bitcoin "worth" $30B.
In order for the functionality of Bitcoin to be valuable, people have to already be valuing the basic units of the currency.   Just like with the security aspect, it's self-sustaining and self-amplifying... or not.  
Bitcoin was "bootstrapped" by people with vision valuing it for its potential, but as it goes mainstream it's being valued for its own sake, and simply because other people value it.  When and if it gains additional real utility, that should add to its value, but I'd say it's a small fraction of Bitcoin's current valuation.
As someone posted here recently, it seems like most of the innovators have given up on the community ever cooperating and progressing toward a scaling solution, and are moving on to other options.  So I have my doubts that Bitcoin will be the flavor of crypto to implement widely-used "programmable money" features, but it might very well end up being the *de facto* non-fiat value store, like gold/silver is today.

Using it to buy and then re-sell locally is also problematic, making you a money transmitter at some threshold.  And anyone you transfer to might then use them for one of the aforementioned purposes, which would look no different from you shuffling the coins around a bit before sending them there.

Comparison to physical commodities like oil is pretty much meaningless.  If there were only 21 million (or billion for that matter) barrels of oil, they'd all be seized by governments and would be literally priceless, but that's because oil has direct utility as a high-density energy store.  Bitcoin is like money, in that it only has value because people believe it has value, and the extent of that value is not based on anything more than the extent of that belief.

A Turing machine can be implemented with two stacks instead of a tape, but that doesn't mean anything with two stacks is automatically Turing-complete.
If I remember undergrad CS correctly, it's easily shown that a Turing-complete system requires either arbitrary looping (test-and-jump) or recursion, and Bitcoin script has neither.

Really, the Fed is a hybrid.

I'm trying to remember when I first starting hearing the "new bubble" talk, somewhere around $15 I think.  I stopped buying around $20 because I figured it was rising too fast, and I kept waiting for a big drop before buying more.  Silly me.
There's no question that the price will go down at some point, but it's only a bubble if it goes down "far enough" and stays there.  Where is that line, $100? $50? $20? It's downright silly to say anything is or is not a bubble except in retrospect.  It's neither yet, and your predictions are just as useless as the people predicting $10K/BTC.


The "intrinsic value" of gold is minuscule compared to its current price.  The intrinsic value of paper money is that you can burn it to keep warm; so what?  We don't live in a barter economy, so currency doesn't need "intrinsic value", it needs to be useful as a medium of exchange.
This objection is nothing short of silly.  You either don't understand the basic concept of money, or are desperately reaching for negatives here.


So what?  USD is negative-sum, but it still manages to be a useful medium of exchange.  If everyone "cashed out" of anything; gold, USD, Google stock, etc.; it would become effectively worthless, because it's only worth what people value it for *right now*.


Wait, bitcoin will crash and die, or it will grow rampantly?  Which is it?
The average person doesn't need to "deal with" the blockchain. This is irrelevant to the current discussion.  It's like saying the average person could never balance the daily ledger for a multinational bank.


Also irrelevant, you're reaching again.
I get the distinct feeling that you *want* bitcoin to fail.  Did you just miss out, or sell out for pennies?
I'd like to think that even if I hadn't managed to get a modest stake, or had squandered it, I would still be rooting for bitcoin on its laudable fundamental principles.

Bitcoin moves responsibility to the end-user, and less responsibility is one of the major reasons people like credit cards.
Credit cards and checks suffer billions in fraud every year, but it's absorbed by the banks and merchants by increased prices and fees on everyone, so the cost of fraud is "socialized."
As a result, people have no direct incentive to be careful, and put their credit card number into websites; perhaps using only "trusted" sites, but heedless of key-loggers, etc.; and hand their credit card to any waiter/attendant who asks and might have a card scanner behind the desk or in their pocket.

If whether it's a bubble is entirely subjective, then it makes even less sense for people to be saying that it absolutely is or is not, especially if they're not personally invested.
A 20% loss to 200 means the last day was a bubble.  A 50% loss to $125 means the last week was a bubble.  A 90% loss to 25 means the last few months were a bubble.  My point is that you can only make any meaningful statement about this *after* it happens.
And I don't have anything to lose because I didn't put any more money in than I was willing to see disappear completely.  I'll be the first to say that it absolutely could go to zero, and anyone who bought more BTC than they can afford to lose is a fool.

The US Dollar is the world's prime instrument for money laundering and illicit transactions in general.  The vast majority of all illegal narcotic, weapon, sex, etc., trade is conducted in US Dollars, and no financial institution avoids USD for this reason.  Bitcoin is inferior for these purposes because it's more traceable.  The only relevant distinction is that Bitcoin is not limited to physical transactions but, when banks participate in money laundering, USD can be laundered electronically as well.
This is like a GOP talking point: nearly every news outlet gets it completely wrong, but it keeps coming up all over no matter how little it makes sense or relates to the topic at hand, and it diminishes the credibility of anyone who repeats it.


In many jurisdictions Bitcoin is already "regulated," just as with any other item of value.  In the U.S., if you trade produce you grew in your garden for something on Craigslist, that's a taxable transaction, and Bitcoin is no different.  The US Dollar is only special in that the IRS will only accept payment in that form.
The regulation you're talking about is really about trying to add traceability and remove anonymity from USD transactions.  Since Bitcoin has a public ledger, all that's required is to establish those links where it's converted from/to other currencies, and it becomes more traceable than existing currencies.
In that sense, I agree that before long you can expect laws requiring "significant" transactions to be tied to a confirmed identity in an attempt to make Bitcoin addresses as traceable as bank accounts.  Just as with cash, of course, this doesn't prevent people from swapping briefcases in a parking lot.


In an Illuminati fantasy world where all governments work together, perhaps.  In reality, *a* government can "stop" Bitcoin by forcing it underground and giving up all associated potential tax revenues and economic benefits, but that may result in giving an advantage to other countries.  The more governments attempt to suppress it, the more useful it becomes for moving value around those artificial walls.  Directly attacking it is free publicity and lends it credibility as real competition to established currencies, and so could easily backfire.  Given the conservative nature of these institutions, those already aware of Bitcoin are likely waiting to see how it turns out before acting.  Like the Internet, though, it might end up moving so quickly that it takes decades for them to catch up.

And so what?  Will they release that information to anyone without a warrant?  I hope not.
Have the people who lost their Bitcoin on SM reported the theft to ... the FBI? (I guess?) I doubt it.
Could those people show that they own those funds and that they were stolen?  Without reveling that they were buying illicit substances?  I doubt it.
Would the FBI prosecute a case if people could and did show that?  I doubt it.
The only thing stopping him from cashing out is the possibility that an exchange would violate their own privacy agreements and leak his identity to the SM community; some of whom would probably torture and murder him.  Once he associated those coins with a bank account, he would probably live the rest of his life expecting retribution at any moment.
If he could cash out into gold quickly enough, though, he might disappear pretty easily.  Though I doubt any vendors can get that much gold quickly, and how to move around and store two metric tons of gold, a cube half a meter on a side at best, might require some thought.

That's pretty funny.  You should look up the definitions of the words you use; it helps you not contradict your own arguments and look like a fool.
[Commodities]( have intrinsic value, but as you've already pointed out so vehemently, bitcoin does not.

Yes... we've lost 3 whole days worth of growth so far.  So going from $10 to $100+ in a few months proves it's a bubble?  Just as the article said, you'll take any loss as proof of your point.  Every loss is the end of some "bubble," whether it's an hour or a year long.
Now find somewhere that shows market depth, and look at the buy orders.  There are a ton of people itching for a big drop so they can buy in.  I honestly hope it drops a great deal, I just find it unfortunate that you will take that as some kind of validation of your vague speculations based on egregious misunderstandings.

If you get out when the price starts to fall, you're betting that it will fall further.  If you're wrong and it rallies before you get back in, you're screwed.  If you're in for the long term, you're betting it's going to recover, and more, it's just a question of when.

The time needed is really a function of several things, including the dollar amount.  For many purchases, especially small, in-person ones, a double-spend attack would be far more effort than it's worth, and they can be accepted immediately.
As far as a merchant is concerned, PayPal transactions take *45 days* to "clear."  Credit card charges can be contested up to 60 days after the purchase, meaning the transaction can be reversed up to 90 days later.  In both cases, charge-back fraud is rampant, running to Billions per year, and makes up a significant ongoing cost to businesses.
From a customer's point of view, the lack of reversibility is a bad thing, of course.  On the other hand, a business should be able to offer lower prices with Bitcoin, so a customer can at least expect to pay less.  Regardless, some way for customers to trust that the merchant isn't going to rip them off will be vital.
This means that in a "Bitcoin economy," an existing and well-trusted business will be fine, but starting a new business will be very difficult, and will require you to massively undercut your competition or have "endorsement" from trusted sources.

Bitcoin effectively shifts the risk of fraud from the merchant to the customer.  Merchants no longer lose out due to charge-back fraud (which is huge in many markets), but customers no longer have any way to make legitimate charge-backs when the merchant fucks up or simply disappears.
Eliminating the high fees and fraud associated with credit card processing would have a huge economic benefit, saving many billions per day in overhead across many markets.  For your average consumer, however, saving a few cents all over won't come close to making up for being defrauded on a single large purchase, at least not when it comes to the psychological aspect of considering full-on adoption.  The popularity of extended warranties is evidence of exactly this kind of inefficient preference.  I suspect the ability to reverse charges was a significant factor in the near-universal adoption of credit cards for everyday spending, even by those who very rarely take advantage of that ability.
Bitcoin has a clear benefit for consumers in overall lower overhead, and many transactions (tips, lunch, gas, etc.) have no real need for reversal, but in general some way to arbitrate charge-backs for "major" transactions is vital, and as long as such a system exists it can be exploited.  So the idea that a merchant can expect absolutely zero fraud risk will have to change, eventually.
There's also the possibility of an attacker exploiting BitPay itself (or even the blockchain protocol) so the fraud risk, however small, is not really zero.
