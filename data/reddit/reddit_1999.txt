If you don't mind my asking what bank is that? I'm going thru this same process at the moment.

Your 401k is mooning but your kids and grandkids will have to pay for it. Also, the Republicans will claim they need to cut SS and Medicare in a few years due to the debt.

If I'm a long term hodl'er I'd rather see BTC at 14k when futures trading begins than at 19k. Less chance of the whales shorting it if it has just corrected 5k, right?

+1. There is a segment of society that gets their news solely from Fox or Limbaugh. This is the kind of talking point that get pounded into their heads relentlessly and then they go out and repeat it. The Military budget is like $700 BILLION a year, while they want you to hate a person who's getting a $200 a month welfare check because their job got sent to Mexico.  SMH!

I had them tattooed onto my a$$, as long as I have access to a mirror I/m OK.

The author wrote "Every move to the upside is more evidence of the bubble. Every profit-taking dip to the downside is yet more evidence there’s a bubble." Sooooo..... if it goes up it's a bubble and if it goes down it's a bubble? I guess the whole stock market is a bubble too then.  Come to think of it, my penis is a bubble as it goes up and down too.

Not illegal but there are many exchanges that do not have a license to operate in NY. Kraken, Poloniex do not service NY but you can use Coinbase and a few others.

anti-fragile? I've never heard that term.

Hey genius, I'm already verified on Coinbase, I'm trying to get verified on GDAX.

From this story I dislike both of 'em. The young guy bragging about his net worth is a douche nozzle, and the old guy who needs to one-up the young douche nozzle is not much better in my opinion.

Theoretically great, but in reality the taxpayers would be made to bail the SOB's out (again) and the CEO's will still get their 10 million dollar bonuses.

Same here. I guess they are totally overwhelmed right now with the current bitcoin frenzy. It's time for them to hire some more people.

Thank you so much for this thread. I'm starting this process with Broad Financial right now. If you don't mind, are you happy with this crypto IRA so far?

taxation is theft? Taxes are how you pay for things like the $650 BILLION dollar a year military budget, and Medicare and SS, and cops/ firemen, and bridge and road maintenance. Disaster aid, etc.. etc...  What kind of country do you want to live in, Koch-topia?

Do you have to have a whole bitcoin or do you get fork for owning fractional too?

+1000! I'm trying to get verified on GDAX for weeks. Sent a pic of license multiple times, sent emails to customer support, NO response.

What could make more than one of the exchanges go down?

Then move to Kansas and see if you like it.

Don't look at any more for 5 years, then smile when you  see 20k in the account.

When you give out fines that are 1/100th of the amount of money they made by doing whatever it was you fined them for, and nobody ever gets any jail time, then where is the deterrent?
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:04:09
Isn't the premium ridiculous for GBTC though?
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:59:03
Have you had your bitcoin for over a year? If so the tax is much less than if you sell in less than a year.

Jail the douchebag.

Ha, one of these days autofill/auto correct is going to start world war III.
