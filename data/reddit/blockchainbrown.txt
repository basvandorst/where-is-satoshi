lol lil sassy I see....atom bomb was only theoretical until it was made, if I was a government I would be very worried about bitcoin, would invest billions to crack quantum computing in secret (when everyone is saying it's theoretical and worried about big foot), allow the market to reach large market cap, then either openly short with futures or just steal wallets while masking it as a "hacker". 
that being said I don't think you actually think big foot and quantum computers pose the same risk to your bitcoin, but if you do you should move far from Pacific Northwest

My worry is more as it relates to encryption

thank you, looking for any educational/resource material I can read as a non tech person to better understand

Is this true? Can btc’s encryption - which is major underpin to its value prop- be updated if only one government/group breaks through and produces the first functioning quantum super computer? If so why not do it now well before someone has it and essentially can break the keys for every wallet ?

Is bitcoin sales just taxed like capital gains?”

Especially this part
"Governments aren’t just playing defense. Documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 showed that the NSA is building its own quantum computer as part of an $80 million research program called Penetrating Hard Targets, according to the Washington Post. It’s unclear how far the NSA has gotten in its quest. The agency declined to comment.”

this is all true IF quantum computers were even close to be produced.

"Would it likely be a major short as they've already been accumulating? Or is there a logical explanation to why that isn't likely?" 
- WS could not own anything but a small share of the available bitcoins (less than 2 of the available 16 million coins were mind this last year) because there are a lot of early btc adaopters HODL a ton of coins...I'd be more worried about them manipulating the positions on CME for x4 leveraged profits.
