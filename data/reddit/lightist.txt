Bitcoin is threatening the entire fabric of the capitalist system which has fundamentally diverted from its core function of capturing centralized equitable value store system of energy  (Energy Time Units)  spent  by individuals over time to grow,make, find, invent  for the well being of every one.
Capitalist system is leading society to its ultimate destruction, as over hundreds of years of its cleaver derivatives, market manipulated fake value system, debt based system at expense of majority of humanity and nature , has not lead to one single food item that can produced for humans to consume to survive. It is insulting to say we have made quantum leaps in our progress , while being totally dependent on nature to provide all organic based food items for our survival.
By misleading humanity through control of money, education  and media continues to mislead lead humanity of true values that are consistent  with natural principles that are ultimate companions of humanities survival. The core human values of honesty, integrity and fairness is critically missing from FX manipulated currency systems which has degraded natural world, with more than half of  humanity living in appalling conditions. 
Fake market lead forces necessitated by debt lead financial systems propels humanity (that are kept on ever tightening  invisible monetary sponsored legislative nooses) so that we all stay in their carefully defined invisible cages to acquire and consume as directed  at the expense humanity and the planet, for single purpose of ultimate control in the hands of few. Planet can only cope with so much alteration , without able to invoke self repair system evolved over billions of years.
Bitcoin to me has all the hallmarks of  nature inspired enlightenment for humanity to reevaluate its priorities, eliminate inflation based monetary systems, provide equity to human based energy expenditure, and promote diversity and decision making to greatest possible number of humans ( diversity appears to be core evolutionary mandate). 
Bitcoin community will have to look straight in the eye of the time , stay strong with its core values  and continue to champion its adoption without any self doubt,  for the sake of us all.
