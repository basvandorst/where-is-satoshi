yes.  clearly telling you to clearly express yourself so others can understand you is statist.
I am not sure if you are this stupid or just upset, but you will have a terrible time in life if you keep doing what you are doing.  You and those unfortunate enough to be around you.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:13:08
why do you keep selling lower than you are buying? or are you talking about hypothetical situations?
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:42:15
I'd really like to understand the article but have no clue what's going on.
is the complaint that too many bitcoins were sold?  That they were sold too low?
@_date: 2014-01-03 20:26:04
yes - the proper thing to do is time consuming and tedious, otherwise more people would do it.
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:14:09


no stupid - I am not arguing with anyone.  I simply pointed out to you (my first mistake) how proper, civil discourse works.
If you notice, I never attacked any points - because I don't know enough about the subject - which, again, is why my original comment makes even more sense: explain your points if you want to be taken seriously and to help others.
sorry that you are too stupid to understand how a proper conversation and exchange of ideas is supposed to happen.  I can guarantee you that you are the one that will suffer as a result.
take care.

just because it doesn't have a ? at the end doesn't mean it's not a question.  It's how debates happen.  You say something, someone else says something else back and forth - neither should be downvoted.


yes - as in "questioning the information presented"


in your opinion

the proper thing to do would be to list WHY you THINK the responses are trivial or benign - that way people can make up their own mind
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:25:48
I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be a dick, but I still don't get it.
If you buy it at X...and price falls to Y, if you sell at Y+10%, you are not making a 10% profit, unless your definition of profit somehow ignores that you lost money from the initial value.
it seems like a race to the bottom.
So for example:
you buy at 1000$ - price drops to $500, you sell at $550.  Now, while the $550 represents a $50 bump from the present value, you sunk $1000 into it.
how is this sustainable?

no comment that ASKS QUESTIONS should be downvoted.  But thanks for your response.

The problem is there are few credible mainstream alternatives. I use venmo as well but that's a PayPal subsidiary.
I don't keep any money in my PayPal account to minimize chance of issues
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:49:15
Can someone explain what's going on?
I have my own business and I use PayPal to process payment...I don't hold any funds in the account, it's immediately transferred to my bank.
What did this guy do that I need to avoid doing?

how is it down 30%???? Gdax is up
@_date: 2015-07-14 15:21:49
I kind of half follow this community and have just a basic understanding of bitcoin, so excuse me if I sound ignorant but...why are you doing this?
isn't the price dropping significantly?  I thought it was a peak of like 1k, then it has steadily dropped...what makes you think it won't tank completely?  
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:37:51
is coinbase an exchange?
I made an account - just never did anything with it.
What would you suggest?  Like I said, I'm looking to make a monthly BTC purchase with a % of revenue.  So it would be one buy a month and ideally take those coins off whatever exchange I bought them from.  I wouldn't be looking to sell as it would be a long term investment.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:26:10
Thanks - yeah been googling and reading and people are saying something similar.  Coinbase has higher fees because they simplified the process.
So I guess that changes my thinking - I'd go straight with the GDAX account and don't even see the point of coinbase.  Wouldn't I be able to fund my GDAX/trades the same way as on coinbase, just with less fees?
Basically if you are comfortable with GDAX, what function does coinbase serve? Since I wouldn't be using any merchant services or wallet services.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:11:44
thanks for the feedback.
I just opened a GDAX account with my coinbase account.
I'm not sure why, but I read the FAQ but couldn't get much out of it, but that's probably my fault, if you don't mind I do have one more question.
I'll be using my personal bank account to fund this, not a CC and located in USA.
From what I understand, GDAX charges nothing to fund my account if using ACH which as I understand it means I transfer it from my bank account, not wired. Then I would transfer my funds to my coinbase account, and any bitcoin I buy will be charged the buy price + up to 4% as fee (depending on purchase method).
Then I transfer it to GDAX (free) and to my wallet (free)?
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:49:07
Yeah, I think that's the conclusion I have reached as well...I am not a heavy trader, but I do have a moderate investment portfolio (again, buy and hold, not day trade).
What I am looking into now is if there is some sort of fee I'm missing, but it does seem pretty straight forward. Will be making my first investment end of October :D
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:54:01


what makes someone else better than coinbase?  I've never used it, but it seemed like you just link a bank account or a CC or some form of payment and go.
I looked up the trezor - $100 isn't much and the nano S looks even cooler and it's cheaper, so that's pretty sweet!
Any other tips?
Like I said - my plan is to take 5-10% of profit (I'd estimate around $500-1000) and invest it into bitcoin and some of the other crypto currencies.  I wouldn't be selling this, just holding for growth.
So link a CC/bank account to coinbase, buy the $500-$1000 at the end of the month, then transfer to my nano S or trezor.  My cost would be only the transaction cost for buying the bitcoin, but I wouldn't get charged to move my coins to my private wallet or any other bs?
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:29:56
is there a charge to move the bitcoins off the exchange to your private wallet or are the fees only on purchase/sale of bitcoins?
I have nothing invested at this point, but I run a small business and wanted to take 5-10% of monthly net and put it into bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:14:51
if people can trade BTC and co on GDAX, why even involve coinbase?
Or better yet - if I don't need the details and charts, if I'm just looking to purchase a set amount of bitcoin at end of every month, regardless of price, couldn't I just do all of it on coinbase?  Or is it the free transfer to wallet that make GDAX worth it? 
edit: Basically, I'm looking to minimize my fees as I will be making one buy trade per month, and for safety would transfer my coins to my personal wallet
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:56:59
hmmm, I'm a little confused...if GDAX is their exe change platform, what's coinbase?
like how would the process work?  I create a coinbase account, that's linked to my bank account or CC to purchase the coins.  I buy X amount of coins at end of month.  Those coins are on coinbase and I get charged price of coin + transaction fee.
Then I move my coins from coinbase to GDAX, which is linked to my private wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-28 15:24:09
EXACT CHANGE, MOTHERFUCKER!
