they're even selling for more than the block erupter blade...

so what do i do if i sold all the Bcash I got from the fork from the BTC I mined 5+ years ago?
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:04:25
WD announced it a few days ago. Should be available soon

good thing hard drives are coming in 10TB flavors now
@_date: 2014-04-11 05:25:12
I agree. From my own memory, for the past few years the USD/BTC has always peaked right around December. It goes up, it goes down, repeat.
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:06:59
I plan on finding the correct hard drive sometime, but no intention of selling the BTC for a few years. 2016/2017 is when I plan on replacing my truck, and whatever they're worth then might help with the cost of that. My current wallet only has 2/3 of a coin now, and i use that wallet fairly regularly.

Somewhere in my house is a hard drive with 15BTC on it from a few years ago... Too lazy to find it.
edit: apparently cold storage is frowned upon?
@_date: 2014-02-26 10:15:42
well, from the graphs that I can find, it seems that every december/january there is a spike in value... 
@_date: 2014-04-11 11:58:47
hmm, correct. but my point still holds.

Did I miss the golden shower?

I should probably look for that old hard drive from back when CPU mining was a thing...
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:35:36
Perhaps you saved the wallet file to a thumb drive, or burned to a cd? maybe even an old hard drive
@_date: 2013-10-20 16:48:22
My goal isn't to get a profit from the coins... I just want the coins without having to give out a bank account or credit card number.
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:27:33
wow... damn. I guess I would ask if he's looked into any charities. There are plenty of them that worthwile

when my gf broke up with me I should have invested $1,000 in coins instead of buying a new computer. That was July 2010. I would be a millionaire
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:57:52
Why am I not freaking out?  Because I've spent a grand total of $350 in coins and mining hardware. And I have almost 0.5BTC so far. I bought 0.1BTC when it was at $325. When I put my money into this, or anything that could be profitable later, I don't consider that money to be readily available. It's money that I no longer have. I don't think to myself "I have $40,000 in the stock market", it's closer to "I threw some money into a hole, maybe it'll be worth more later, who cares, I'm still getting a paycheck from my job". I consider my "investments" as money that has disappeared, not money that I have.

only if you do something funny... like holding up a sign at a college football game
@_date: 2013-10-20 18:51:59
thing is... i was considering investing then. I decided against it because I doubted that it would go anywhere.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:46:42
As much as I imagine how much I would have right now If I had invested in 2010 instead of buying new computer parts... I can honestly say that If I bought for $0.004, I would most likely have sold once it hit $1. That's just the reality of it. Once you've realized a 250x gain, would you honestly believe it would go any higher?

mining and buying in person with cash
