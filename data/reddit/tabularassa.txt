Are there any downsides to adding the LN layer to the Bitcoin network?
Isn't that effectively delegating trust to that layer?  Can the LN layer be trusted in the same way as the bitcoin network?
Also, could the LN layer(s) be seen conceptually as sort of intermediary cryptocurrencies that support higher transaction volume, and settle their balances on the Bitcoin network?

Large merchants using payment processors such as Bitpay will likely choose to convert all BTC to cash upon sale (much easier for them to deal with conventional money in their accounting books).  The effect of large sales in BTC by these new big merchants is the equivalent to lots of people cashing out, thus creating a downward pressure on the price.

I agree with you.
However, to me the irony is that I believe that if a government is not against bitcoin, it is likely because it doesn't fully understands it yet.

I agree with you. However, on the positive feedback loop,  I think the media exposure when new merchants join is more likely to attract more merchants eager to capitalize on this "gold rush", than to attract new users. In my opinion, users and buy-demand tends to be greater after news of average Joes becoming rich by investing in bitcoin. (e.g. the news back on Oct about the Norwegian guy who bought a condo after selling his initial $24 bitcoin investment. I think that news generated huge demand)
Which is why I think that, everything else being equal, if we enter a phase of many new merchants joining the party, I believe that that won't make the price spike, but rather hold or even trend downward.

Good job. Very clear and generally understandable to the average person.
However, when people mention those bitcoin clones, it is important to point out that the value of a crypto currency comes not only from the source code, but from the network effect (the infrastructure that supports it, its trading volume, the ecosystem of users and merchants, etc).
So, even though anyone can copy the code, it doesn't mean that a new crypto currency automatically becomes valuable and widely accepted overnight.
A good analogy is Reddit.  Only because the source code is available, it doesn't mean that if I create a copy of it I will magically have a web site with millions of users, relevant content and the hardware infrastructure to support it all.

I don't know about you guys, but I'm suspecting that the reason Gox is coming up with this bullshit excuse, is because in reality they don't have all the BTC they say they have in their site accounts.  
Could it be that behind the courtains they are doing some "fractional reserve" tricks as banks do?  and that they are creating new BTC internally that doesn't really exist in the blockchain?
Does it sound too far fetched?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the effect of BitPay on bitcoin kind of the equivalent to lots of people cashing out?  (pushing the price down)
If a merchant or a person accepts bitcoins in a transaction, and then uses those bitcoins to carry out other transactions (not cashing out), then that is effectively expanding the bitcoin economy. (I know this is the ideal situation, and that we are not quite there yet).
However, if a merchant or person accepts payment through Bitpay, it only means those bitcoins are being turned to cash, and the actual bitcoins are not flowing back and forth in exchange for goods (without being converted to fiat). So it's not helping to expand the bitcoin economy *that much*.
Sorry if it wasn't too clear.  English is my second language.

Alright, then we can just add this to the definition:  *...distributed process to secure the bitcoin network and ensure that all transactions are authentic, valid and irreversible....*
It's not like my description is a misrepresentation, or a lie. It's only making it more simple to understand to the layman, and addresses the negative misconception that bitcoins are created out of thin air.  They are not.  In a way, new bitcoins represent the value added by those who secure and maintain the network.

I really thought the hash rate was going to have a higher correlation to the price of bitcoin (as it's less profitable, more people turn off their miners).
However, the hash rate has continued to sky rocket even with the price coming down significantly in the last weeks.
I guess that mining hardware is becoming more and more powerful and energy efficient...
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:16:53
If they bring up the fact that bitcoin is being used to buy drugs, simply point out that in that regard it is no different than cash.
In fact, you can convey the simple message that Bitcoin is just like cash, except that it cannot be counterfeited, and it is more easily divisible and transferable.

Every time someone describes mining as 'solving a math problem' it kinda sounds like a pointless task which has no value, don't you think? Kinda making the whole thing sound more like a scam, rather than a sound monetary system.
Instead, why not describe mining for what it really is? (In simple terms so that all the non-geek people can understand): It is a distributed verification process to ensure that all Bitcoin transactions are authentic and valid. Those who participate in this process provide their resources (computers, electricity, etc), and in return they get rewarded with bitcoins.
There. If you describe it like that you immediately understand that mining is an activity where real value is being created. That explanation would make the whole system more understandable to the average non-geek.

@_date: 2013-08-06 14:54:15
They have no incentive to ship units quickly. The reason for such ridiculously long delays is pretty clear. After they finish each unit they mine with them for months, and only ship them at a trickle rate to give the overall impression that they are actually shipping all their products and that it's not a scam.

Which is why I believe those coins may be forever lost.
I don't think he would cash out or use a good amount of those initial coins to avoid being traced and identified.
My theory is that he probably destroyed a good amount of those initial addresses. He's been mining from day 1, so he could afford to do that and still end up with a fortune.

This kinda confirms everyone's suspicions that they've had the miners in their possession all along, but just decided not to ship them so they could mine with them until no longer profitable.
The other explanation would be that because of the pressure from people getting refunds, all of a sudden BFL has magically multiplied their production speed and they're being able to ship much faster now.
You decide which explanation is more likely to be true
