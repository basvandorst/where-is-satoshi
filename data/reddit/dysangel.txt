how many BTC was that when you started though?

if you are referring to any coin that only has a linear increase in scaling then I'm guessing you aren't a computer scientist, or even someone who remotely understands computational efficiency

that quote looks more like he is talking about centralised as in unified, as in a global currency. But decentralised from a technical perspective. Which bitcoin isn't just now, far too much centralisation occurring around both the miners and "bitcoin core".

that's how it looks to me, I'm still holding back some cash though in case of one last capitulation. If the market continues as it has the last few years, I probably will never need to buy crypto again

I kind of agree on the "feeling" after having analysed charts for so long and coding trading bots. I think the price has been rising too slowly over a period of months to be a bull trap. But, always got to have that doubt and be prepared.

or if it turns out to be a bull trap.. sham-pain

lol I've been buying the dip since 3k. I still am prepared for a further crash to 1-2k, have been saving some cash just in case. But if it's all up from here I won't complain.

you mean when you arrange them properly it looks like a dick?

it does seem like we could be back to a slow climb similar to 2015/2016. People will just gradually give up and buy back in I guess? Or institutions will FUD while they slowly onboard, trying not to push up the price.

I respect this outlook and have been considering something similar like getting a bitcoin debit card and using it as my bank account. My "real" bank has now locked me out of my own account twice in 3 weeks since starting buying bitcoin. It just goes to show how good it is to be your own bank.
Are you planning to move any of that into stocks or more stable investments over time? I'm currently planning 50% invested into a stocks ISA, 50% into crypto just to be on the safe side until all the politics with segwit etc plays out.

I don't think it has to be all or nothing. It comes across to me more like surrealist humour than SJW in this case.

crypto?
