Having lived through a few asset bubbles I recognize bitcoin for what it is at this current moment in time.
I know that many of you are new to financial markets of any sort.
Don't be greedy friends, make sure you are selling on the way up.

You should always have cash on hand in case of emergencies.
You are playing with fire.
Ask the people in Puerto Rico how far their bitcoin got them after the hurricane hit... Surprisingly bitcoins aren't worth much when there's no electricity/internet. 
Just something to keep in mind.

[Reality says otherwise.](
Even people that had gold were up a creek.
It takes time for people to transition to other methods of payment. It's not easy to convince a farmer to trade his corn for your digital money.  That sort of thing takes time to gain acceptance, assuming you have electricity.

I wish you the best of luck in eating your brain wallet when you are hungry.

Dozens of people using it here and there isnt going to change anything.
I still scratch my head trying to figure out how face to face transactions work when it can take days for your transactions to verify. I guess it works a bit like a virtual check. Except that its value can drop 50% while you wait for it to clear.

Well before credit cards you had credit at the individual store you did business with.
layaway was also a popular option for many.
Or, get this. You saved money so that you could buy something you wanted.

But why should I as a store owner want your bitcoin?
I can't pay taxes with it, I cant pay my employees with it, I cant pay my suppliers with it. etc. etc.
Honestly, until you have a government accept bitcoin as payment for tax obligations it's never going to take off as a currency.

How long would it take to sell 40k worth of bitcoins?
Whats the liquidity like on the market?

A commodity may be a bit of a stretch. I'd say it is the equivalent of internet beanie babies.

I agree with your sentiments on the economy.
But why should people buy the equivalent to 1's and 0's on a computer instead of gold?
It takes an enormous amounts of financial capital and labor to get an ounce of gold out of the ground. There's some hard money involved in obtaining it.
How much money does it cost to generate a Bitcoin? Does it cost $20,000 worth of electricity to generate 1 Bitcoin? I highly doubt it.
If you want to know the true value of a Bitcoin it is really quite easy. The true value of a Bitcoin is simply the value of the electricity that went into its creation. Any price higher than this is pure speculation.

But what if all of your gold gets lost in a tragic boating accident?
