 here is a list of exchanges that accept credit card. I do not recommend you PayPal because the fees are much higher. Coinbase has the lowest fees and it is 100% reliable, you also have Coinmama and BitPanda with low fees, and you have IndaCoin that is actually based in UK but fees are higher. Anyway i reviewed them so take a look.

 Here is some of the exchanges you can use and i reviewed. For example on BitPanda,  BitPanda offers different levels of verification based on how much information you give them.
Verified Email: With a verified email you cannot buy bitcoins, but can sell up to 1,000 EUR worth of bitcoins per day, and up to 7,500 EUR per month.
Verified Phone Number: With a verified mobile phone number you can buy bitcoins with any payment methods besides credit card. Using the other payment methods, you can buy up to 50 EUR per day.
Verified ID: By verifying your ID you can buy bitcoins with a credit card, up to 350 EUR per day and up to 10,000 per month. For other payment methods, you can buy up to 5,000 EUR worth of bitcoins per day, and up to 75,000 EUR per month.
Also there is Indacoin where you only need phone number but fees are little bit higher.
