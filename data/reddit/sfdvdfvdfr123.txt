A 5 minute snoop of social media would reveal the same information.

You are only talking about the implication of why it doesn't matter. The fact remains that 21 million was chosen by someone.

You're going to have to hit that sidebar hard, son.

Your *feelings* don't matter, whether people realise it or not, investing in bitcoin is investing in freedom. Let them come for the gains, it doesn't matter.

Its also Ironic that Roger's effort to make himself wealthier cost him dearly.

People have been kneecapped for 20k dollars. 


Obviously you are not talking about the same level of money as other people in this tread where it puts you into the 0.01% of people and isolates you from the reach of others.

People buy on the way down and on the way up. Thanks for a downvote for my contributing to a discussion, you obviously don't understand how karma works.

For guys dumping over a million dollars into an account you don't load up the regular website, you talk to your account agent.On the phone. They could be conducting these transactions OTC.

1. Look at all the people on this very post wanting to buy more at cheaper prices who jumped in straight away.
2. The price didn't jump back up to levels of 3 hours ago. This shows that this whale sold once and didn't immediately buy back. 
This shows a whales got spooked and sold, diluting the BTC to even more people who are far less likely to sell at the same time in the future. It's been this way since before 2013.
This is why we tell people not to panic sell. The whale lost a couple of percent in slippage and also exchange fees if they are not making trades OTC.

Whales can only sell once.

Not if you already HODL and work there.

what i really want to know is if this guy had proper opsec or how he became a target.

I have some money on there and the withdrawal process while currently broken seems to randomly change with no sight that its going to ever work again.

Guys, please keep shitcomments out of the sub.

They sell direct so you wont be able to get a new one.

If only this sub owned bitcoin each person could only mathematically have 16,978,587/800,000= 21.22 btc each.
