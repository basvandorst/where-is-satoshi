This is options, not futures.

Strange, I sat mine at 40 sats and IT took 8 hours

Total fantasy, just HODL. This is not a Casino

Login to gdax.com, same AS Coinbase account. Transfer coin to exchange - free withdrawal

I'd say dump - the correction is coming.

In the futures market, someone has to be at the other side of each short.

School begins again, after gathering my thoughts over christmas I will make a balanced crypto-portfolio. Bitcoin has issues in use right now that I cannot ignore, I need some time to think. Neither bear, nor bull - just need a break. Even if it means converting to fiat 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:28:22
I just sold all my bitcoins. I need a vacation, constant checking of price etc... See you guys in January :) It's been a fun couple of months

I really think it is shocking how many of you do not know how a future market works. Someone has to be on the other side of that bet - and it’s not us hodlers.

If you want a hedge, find altcoins that are only listes in US and Europa. XRB comes to mind 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:01:33
This is not true. Buy and hold is the nr1 Strategy

OK; like you can predict shit like this
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:00:09
8640 on Coinbase. 9000 before december is realistic!! Can't wait for the memes - I think I'll open a bottle of fine wine and enjoy the show.

What is slower and more expensive to exchange: gold or bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:51:14

What do the market say to the god of 8k? Not today.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:29:57
There are rumours circling about a major crackdown against the trading of Crypto by the EU
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:55:32
You do not understand currency or valuestoring. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:14:51
Which means the price will shoot right back up! yay
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:36:27
It was said by the Norwegian financial authorities at a conference yesterday. Unfortunatelt i dont have any pictures/videos. Hence calling IT rumour

Allthough I agree with you that this is not a big fall, We do not know if it is over yet. The question is: when does the panic set in?
