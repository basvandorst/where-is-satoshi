Not with cars like these. Cars like this increase in value and are rarely driven.  A new Huayra costs $2.7 million, used on average is over $3.85 million.

Binance is .001 (~$11.50), I’m not sure about Huobi. Or you can always convert your BTC to LTC and pay less when you’re transferring it out. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:03:54
quick question: Why Stellar and not LTC?
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:35:38
Quit the bullshit. You can move BTC without paying ridiculous fees. I moved over $40k worth for $8.95. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:05:58
Not a rip off. New the Huayra sells for $1.6 million, but the chances of getting it new are slim to none (they make roughly 100 units a year). Used on the other hand, the average sale price of a Huayra is $2.2-$5.5 million. 
Bugatti Chiron new is $2.7 million from the factory, but again chances of getting it from the factory are slim to none. New from a retailer is around $4.3 million.
So he didn't get a bad deal

You're assuming that once the price is going up like that, more people wouldn't start selling.

So basically just for security and helping the network?
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:46:16
Thanks for the info, I just downloaded the Bitcoin Core wallet, it says it'll take ~~10~~ 6 hours to completely sync.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:14:12
Bigger blocks is a temporary solution with more downside than upside.
Imagine you have a 1 lane highway. That highway runs slow because of too much traffic (transactions). Now you expand that highway to 8 lanes. It frees up space, but again that space quickly fills up because now more people can use the highway. At this point, the small construction companies (nodes) that were fixing the 1 lane highway don't have the man power to fix it anymore, so you have to get fewer larger companies (centralized) to repair the highway. So how do you create less congestion, while still keeping the many smaller nodes? You create different forms of transportation (side chains, LN, segwit, etc). Planes, Trains, Boats, etc.

He's known about it for a long time. Remember when Sean Spicer tweeted a Bitcoin transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:01:41
Are we supposed to believe a non-verified twitter account with 4k followers? I personally think spreading stuff like this does not help bitcoin... especially when the person's has their BTC address posted in their information looking for donations.

I sent 3 (~$40k) BTC with a 0.000674 ($8.95) BTC fee and it took about 2 hours. Not bad at all honestly... I can understand why it would be a problem for people who want instant transactions though... the original fee that it wanted me to pay was around $110, but I opted for "economy" lol.

It’s not worth it for the small folks like us. But there are people with giant mining farms (millions of dollars worth of mining rigs) that are still very profitable. Many are located in China because of cheaper electricity.

You don’t have to trade or sell at a discount. You can sell on an exchange for fiat at current market value. You can have that money transferred directly to your bank account if that’s what you wish to do.

Correct. What I don't understand though is why on the 4 day average does it show two different "unknown" groups? One for 10% the other for 16%?
edit: and on the 48 hour average it also shows 2; one for 17% and the other for 8%.

@_date: 2014-01-08 00:10:36
I invest in both bitcoin and litecoin, I have never thought of them as against each other. Check out most people over there are for working together rather than against. That's why even bitcoin specific news is up voted as well as litecoin specific. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:06:32
As I stated, litecoin is and has been the second strongest and second most valuable crypto. All these other coins coming up are clearly scam coins, but when it's an accepted crypto it's different. It's accepted in not just the litecoin community, but in many businesses also
@_date: 2014-03-25 17:20:21
It's not a single pool, but I know that Cloudhashing has a private pool which has over 20% of the network... That number seems to have grown in the past few days though

@_date: 2014-01-08 00:08:35
You're right, it doesn't add anything significantly different, but as I stated... Why is it bad to have multiple crypto currencies? They could work together rather than "this is the best currency, the only currency."
Just like there are different credit cards, none of them are better than the others, but it's better to have more than just one option. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:09:40
The exchange doesn't have to know who you are. BTC-E asks for nothing more than your e-mail. Then you can sell them locally?
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:10:09
The only reason I don't think BTC will ever reach 10k is because there are so many people who own so much BTC. Like the Winkelvii 120k BTC? You're telling me they will then have $1.2 Billion? Unless these BTC get spread around, you'll never see it hit 10k/BTC.

@_date: 2014-02-07 05:21:19
Well, I can't address everything you wrote, but check out  it shows a bunch of locations that are accepting Bitcoin and Litecoin.
Also, about the horse race... I think Bitcoin could use some improvements that other alt-coins have figured out, but I believe Bitcoin will continue to be the lead crypto currency because it's starting to get accepted a lot more and with bigger companies too. You don't see a company like TigerDirect accepting Litecoin... although, they did say they are open to accepting more crypto's.
@_date: 2014-01-02 16:24:17
This makes no sense. Apply it to the store and people who wish to use it can, and people who don't want to use it don't have to. Simple as that.

Well, since the price is starting to bounce back up (up $70 in the last hour)... thank you
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:18:53
I still don't understand why you were using a coin mixer or why you needed a temporary wallet. If you wanted to move them off of your work computer, you should have put it on a flash drive or used a reputable web-wallet like blockchain.info or coinbase... Why the mixer?
Also, before anyone donates to this guy out of sympathy, make sure you ask for proof of losses.

Gold is still quite volatile. I've seen good rise and fall more than $80 in a matter of seconds. I was on kitco and every time I hit refresh, it was either up $50+ or down $30+. I saw it hit +$100 one second and just a few seconds later be down $20. So no, I don't think volatility after only 5 years is irrational 
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:53:09
I sold a game for $40 worth of BTC. At the time it was .05848 BTC, which is currently worth (on Coinbase) $51.58. If the person asked for a refund, I would refund $40 worth of BTC which is .0445 BTC. 
Since I initially advertised the sale at $40 worth of BTC, then the refund would be $40 worth of BTC.
Bitcoin is still new, it's going to take a few more years for the price to stabilize, until then, all we can do is refer to USD value.

Unknown is a sum of all unknown pools. It was usually around 5-8% until recently. It is known that Cloudhashing controls at least 25% of it, probably more.
@_date: 2014-01-25 21:15:47
Not at all, it takes max 2.5 months. That's if your just mining LTC straight. If you use a multi-pool you could have your graphics card paid off withing a month and a half.
Checkout litecoinpool.org, use their calculator. For example, an R9 280x gets ~750 kh/s. In 30 days at the current difficulty it gets $152. The r9 280x costs $329 and up

Why not work together instead? There are often news articles posted on about bitcoin specific things, but they are accepted there because it's good for litecoin. The same can be done with Why not add to the sidebar - as a complimentary crypto currency?

It's possible, but if everyone is using BTC, then there wouldn't be anyone wanting to crash it because it would hurt them also.
I'm thinking a world currency would be easier because I can travel over-seas without worrying about exchanging currencies. I wouldn't have to worry about fees that go along with exchanging either.

Bitcoin's price has always been based on speculation. There's nothing that holds it's value except for people wanting to use it. Just like the dollar "backed by the faith and credit of the US government". But the BTC value has always been based on the system, not the ETF.

@_date: 2019-04-11 13:49:21
And why do you assume that those videos are something the MSM would broadcast? You have a biased viewpoint and if something doesn't align with your narrative you immediately portray it as fake news/cover up.
You don't care about the fact that Wikileaks selectively releases information because the information they release agrees with your bias. If Wikileaks were truly unbiased and just wanted to release the truth, they would release all the information they received, not withholding information as a "dead man switch" as Assange threatened. They wouldn't selectively release information to help their causes instead of releasing all information they possess.

I started taking Bitcoins at my shop a few weeks ago and just last week I made my first BTC sale! So I decided to create a store on my shops website for Bitcoin-specific sales. I'm just trying to gauge interest with the few items I just listed for sale. If I get a lot of interest, I will add a lot more items.
Also, if you're looking for something specific, just send me a PM and I'll let you know if we have it or not.

I'm not sure about the 7-11, but we've been here (at this location) for 14 years, and another location down the street for about 10 years before that. I've been robbed twice here, and saw a Family Dollar get robbed at my old location.
