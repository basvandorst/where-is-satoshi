If you want to keep for a few years buy now and forget about it
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:20:21
Just out of interest, how big is the team over at Mt Gox HQ?
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:08:18
That's crazy! You're my favourite merchant! :(
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:12:40
 is the easiest way to convert :)
@_date: 2013-11-14 10:35:36
No so they offer a few different services, you can meet up if you like but you can also pay through other methods. Some me chants allow you to internet transfer money to their accounts while others require you going into a bank and doing a cash deposit to their account. 
Example: 
This guy has made over 100 transactions with 99% positive feedback and up to 5BTC in escrow. I have bought off him and the coins were in my account within minutes of depositing the money. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:49:13
Ahhh i keep refreshing to see their answers but they're not coming! Must be waiting to be confirmed
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:03:34
I know i want it to drop so I can buy buy buy
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:51:24
Nice try, Mr Gox.
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:49:22
hoping for this :)
@_date: 2013-11-10 03:35:33
Just transfer it to XBUHbcuhbeldckuuyOBY328974 and i'll do it for you.

This makes me feel good
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:12:49
Sorry dumb mistake, was sidetracked with Mt Gox AMA and monitoring the sell price haha. Thanks, I corrected it!
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:10:24
$2000 right here :/
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:40:02
Send them to me and i'll pay for them
@_date: 2013-11-13 12:41:51
Could someone please explain what i'm looking at? :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:59:06
Ohhhhh the donations 
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:10:29
I'm not telling someone to "come forward"! Oh god haha
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:41:00
Why would you if you heard it from 4chan?! I completely understand the position you were in! hahah
@_date: 2013-11-14 10:14:13
Seconding coinjar, very nice quick and simple way to buy BTC. Alternatively, localbitcoins.com has been great for me recently, some merchants even offer online transfers! 
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:00:48
Wonderful what a great explanation! Thanks :)
 
Do you have any good paper backup services that are known to be easy and good? I know blockchain.info has one I think but i got a little confused last time.
If I have a paper wallet with one address, and I constantly kept it an offline paper account would it be completely safe to just keep adding coins into that account over a long period of time? 
How could I check the contents of the wallet without making it online? Like would a regular blockchain wallet address search tell me or would it say 0 BTC because it's offline?
EDIT: After searching myself a little,  seems to be a great service for this. Even though I'm connected to the internet when the wallet is created, is this a big deal? Or since it works if i load the page then disconnect the wifi, would this cause any problems with it's creation?
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:01:29
I hope by some miracle tomorrow they shoot up to like $500 a coin and I can sit here and laugh at all of your comments about how it's dead and over. I also hope this so I can not be in so much debt...
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:17:02
I think it might be down again
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:52:04
This sounds like the right thing to do. Hopefully i'll be surprised after a miserable 7 days! :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:55:53
$2000 down 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:58:34
I read the whole thing twice and still don't get the point of this post...
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:35:50
also include the reference number
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:46:54
Hey! Welcome :)
I'm also a newbie but I can let you know a few things..
To get started, all you need is a wallet address (for a beginner who might buy a coin or two, I reccomend  Most will say to not use online wallets and I generally agree but for small amounts it's usually okay).
Once you have a wallet, you can do a few things to actually buy some BTC.
First, you can use a merchant who will accept cash deposits to their account and send BTC to your wallet address. Blockchain do it, and for Australia (I only use these so sorry if you're not here), you can use spendbitcoins.com or bitinnovate.com. They are both great! 
Another way you can do it is sign up for an exchange (mtGox is the most popular) and buy and sell on the exchange market. Be warned though, the waiting list to be verified is over 18,000 so it will be a while before you can buy anything.
This is really all you need to know. Once you have some coins in your wallet, you can make a paper backup on blockchain.info (or any other service, just search for "making a wallet backup with...".
If anyone wants to add or correct me go ahead, i'm still new too but these are basic methods to get some BTC :)
EDIT: from the sidebar's "getting started", here are some more ways you can buy them: 
@_date: 2013-11-09 08:43:09
Where do you live in the world?
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:05:52
hahah both a great post title AND first comment!
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:00:18
This is awesome, took me a while to figure it all out but now it's running and very convenient! Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:18:35
I've used them once and service is great so far.. Currently waiting to be verified 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:53:13
In for the answer :)
@_date: 2013-11-10 13:53:49
God damn I wish my coins had transferred by now but they're coming in tomorrow :( I would kill for a piece for 0.1BTC
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:45:27
YES the last one NEEDS to be answered!
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:50:47
I know this is what i've heard and i'm not selling yet. Pretty much most of my savings.. Yes I can 'afford to lose it' but it really will make things difficult. Hopefully when Mt Gox open we will see a huge rise :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:43:10
Sorry, yes generally there is and it is where you put your order number or reference number. If there isn't and the order never had your name on it, you can just put the order id as the name 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:11:47
Haha yes! finally a person we can relate to with a personality! Can't wait to hear from you guys in the future :) Good job making everyone less angry
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:11:18
370 seconds lag, sitting on $74
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:59:47
we're at $130.01 right now
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:03:03
$101.00 and falling shiiiiiit
@_date: 2013-11-10 13:51:37
But with bitcoin being around for years and there already being a pretty huge 'bubble', surely China have been aware of it... Maybe not I just don't really understand
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:02:20
Nice! Where can I buy one?
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:09:53
Back up now! Managed to get an order in for $125
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:37:53
a buttcoin, worth a thousand bitcoins
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:28:10
I'm not saying tell me the one person who is doing the attack because clearly it's not one person, I know what a DDoS is... I'm wondering more the group or person/people in charge.. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:02:05
down to $108.00
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:38:55
Yeah for once they are! 
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:51:19
I'm currently playing on a few other sites so i'd love to give yours a test! Here's my address:
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:56:41
uuuuuuuuuum... $240 :( I know rookie blah blah, I guess lesson learned 
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:18:02
Absolutely stunning! Thanks for this 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:02:55
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:42:28
Yeah I'm leaving it alone ill just sit and wait! Thanks :) I got an order in for $125 which is valid for 4 hours so we will see if I decide to buy more :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:14:28
It's jumping from $70 to $80 over and over holy crap!
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:59:14
This happened to me two days ago and I freaked out... It happened for a few hours and kept giving me different errors like daily limit of SMS has been reached, account locked in 4 attempts. I left it for an hour and tried clicking "send SMS" again, it worked and I got in. 
I then changed my authentication type to google authenticator. 
Don't worry too much, wait it out It must be on their end :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:03:51
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:23:49
Yeah I know but I wish someone could actually prove something so all these dumb posts (mine included) can stop flooding this subreddit. IS MTGOX DOWN OMG?!lol 
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:26:20
Hahah mt vox
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:29:24
+tip 2ndPlaceFirstLoser 10000.01 BTC
Edit: Jokes, I wish... Unfortunately I have lost all my savings so i'm pretty depressed right nowwww
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:13:59
Right now i'm seeing the value from Mt Gox as $108.70 and bitinnovate is currently at $96... I use them but you're right it's not great, I wish we had better options. I'm currently about 16,000 people away from being verified :(
@_date: 2013-04-23 23:31:10
Does anyone know where I can buy a token physical bitcoin (with no value)?
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:09:06
$76 with 303 seconds lag
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:44:55
As soon as the price crashes, it rises a tiny bit then mt gox goes down. What is with this? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:57:57
You can test it on me just to make sure
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:15:52
holy shit, they're all going to the same wallet....
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:39:14
How come there is such a big difference between websites? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:05:43
fuck $78.05
edit: seems to be catching up to the rest of the exchanges
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:15:06
Woo you ship internationally! :) will be making an order soon 
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:56:40
No worries, if you have any questions you might not want to post to reddit, feel free to PM me :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:11:42
Nope, I did too. I bought 6 though..... :(
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:38:54
They have had their coins for years, they're in it for the long haul....
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:19:56
ahhh all so confusing!
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:27:27
Since it's public information, I could use something like this right? 
@_date: 2013-11-10 14:00:31
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:55:02
Currently at $149, hit around $130 earlier today but spent most of the day around $170. Short term you probably won't gain much especially right now. If you're willing to hold then go for it!
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:11:03
I didn't initially have debts.. Nah it's not that bad i'm young so didn't like mortgage my house or anything haha.. I recon there will be a massive influx of buyers if the price gets sub 45
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:07:20
Nope, not true
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:24:52
I started getting in on them about 8 months ago when my friends told me you could buy drugs off silk road. 
I bought some coins and bought a few legal things to see how it worked. Never ended up getting the drugs and semi-forgot about it all! Came back to check and there is now a nice sum sitting in my wallet. Nothing massive but still nice to see it there :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:04:27
will do!
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:41:55
Yep it's down
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:05:18
If i was you i'd be soooooo devoo
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:35:17
Hmmm new account asking for 2BTC with no real proof? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:51:13
name and shame! 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:53:11
Here is a script that on a mac will run it for you (once you have the library installed)
Just open it in text edit, change the path to the path of the script on your computer, then replace 15 with your amount of coins. 
Now open a new terminal window and type:
    **cd desktop** (or wherever you put the BTC.sh) 
    **+x BTC.sh**
Ready to run, now open it and make sure you open with &gt; terminal. Then just select always do this so you don't have to again. Now whenever you open the BTC.sh, it will start terminal and the script by itself. 
Very very basic, but it was annoying me having to keep typing the command so this is now easier. Takes like 3 minutes to set up. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:53:00
Oh whoops! My misunderstanding thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:32:49
Does this site have any reputation? 
You seem to be the first to ever offer paypal...
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:26:29
I have bought some things on BMR and SR before which was only about 2 months ago. Reeaaaaaaly wishing now that I never carelessly spent those BTC! :(
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:40:04
Yeah similar to me! My friend introduced me too (he was using SR) and he knew about it way before me.. He is more annoyed as he spent everything he had. Only JUST bought some more today at $230, ouch! 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:40:52
Well you can't see it now since the list has refreshed but there were about 6 transactions all going to the same address totalling around 4.5 million dollars worth
Edit: correction
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:35:33
Holy crap, I thought my 12 at $240 was bad... I really feel for you! :(
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:26:41
I also am interested in this! :)
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:39:57
I use  it's good so far :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:33:40
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:23:18
I can't help but read every comment on this thread imaging everyone sucking up to each other and being all fake nice just in case bitcoinbillionaire is lurking! 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:08:54
Good work getting them back! 
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:28:18
Yeah I saw them too, ahh everything is such a big mystery! It's what makes it all so addictive
@_date: 2013-11-12 11:03:13
Unfortunately with this difficulty and without expensive asic miners, this is completely true. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:07:10
Working fine for me, might want to email or call them! 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:25:44
Well thanks for making me feel a little less stupid! You're right though.. No one really knows what was going to happen, or what is about to happen! Ill just hold on and get excited :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:06:31
Seems as if those PR reps have finally stepped in to help answer questions :) 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:44:36
Yeah as an investment for a first timer 21 year old, I was so excited. Really going very bad now :(
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:08:49
Sorry, i'm just going off the 3 other sites I have bought off in AUS, I shouldn't have assumed they were all the same. Thanks for that correction
@_date: 2013-11-09 08:57:26
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:20:49
OH MY GOD EVERYONE you actually sound like homeless people begging for money... 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:05:00
Sitting on $90 and still falling
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:43:02
So what does this mean for the average BTC owner?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:57:23
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:44:56
Wish I was verified so I could do the same, Australians don't have the many options to buy and sell :(
