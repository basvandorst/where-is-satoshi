Depends on how much of a fatty you are. For me, one bitcoin currently buys ~32.07 pizzas. And thus I realize that one bitcoin could possibly feed me for a month, and be very good at that.

Gotta be 51% right, 49% wrong to make a profit, though...
@_date: 2015-12-17 07:10:09
Nah. The choice for a small, large or family size pizza depends on how much of a fatty you are.

you're gaining interest because negative feedback doesnt get the system going. Read up on just about every ponzi / scam accusation on bitcointalk. Payouts running for days and stop when the incentive to run off with the money is large enough.

I agree with what [said]( Additionally, I recommend to use a simple average of USD prices from the larger exchanges. Just use the popular ones listed on bitcoinwisdom.com or cryptowat.ch.

Bitcoin as an investment is high risk with possible high reward. Also possible total loss. Is the $10-$20 dollar your total in monthly savings? If so, dont use more than half of it to buy speculative assets. Hell, with that low of an amount you're better off to put it into a piggy bank and start working on a safety net (at least the sum of 3-4 monthly net incomes...).
At last, if you invest in bitcoin NOW you're still in the early adopter phase. There is plenty of time left to blow money on bitcoin and still make a profit, IF it survives.

I played it mostly because I played 2048 anyway. Got one payout several weeks ago. For the "next" payout my balance vanished and nothing was showing up in the provided address. So I'd mark it as abandoned - at last, it was just a entertaining faucet.

If you're interested in learning about technical indicators and their application - Its really not that hard. Look at babypips.com - Its free.
Forging indicators, entry and exit strategies, stop loss, take profit and unit sizing in to an applicable trading strategy - Thats the harder part.
If you want something really easy to trade, look at the turtle trading strategy. Its a slow, handholding and easy to learn and COULD provide some success.
