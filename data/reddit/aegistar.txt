So you're ranting because...?
I've never interacted with Gox but I can't see what the point of this post was. I'm pretty sure the people who have lost money already feel pretty shitty about the situation and hopefully they've learnt their lesson by now.

haha brilliant. Love the idea.

I understand your anger. Losing any amount of money to some random stranger sucks. However, the reason why people here can just act like money vanished is because many of the people here know the risks in crypto currency. The fact that it's not regulated is part of the charm of crypto currency. However, since it isn't regulated, when money disappears like this there's not much anyone can do.

Even if they did, when did America start taking cues from China?

Got it, thanks!

I think to some extent mtgox was factored into the price. There were still some optimists however. Also, the government launching an investigation may be spooking some people as well.

I can see your point about convenience. I mean there's no doubt it's convenient but as we've seen, convenience can come at a price.
Sure keeping your own wallet isn't risk free. Nothing is risk free, but is it at a lower risk? I know I've heard stories of people losing their wallets, but how often do you see that? Compare that to the amount of posts about the problems with mtgox (and even other exchanges). 
Here's one way to backup your wallet that may be overkill but it lowers the amount significantly. Store backup in flash drive. Store flash drive in a safety deposit box. I mean there are tons of cold storage solutions out there, some are safer than others. Most are safer than exchanges.
Quite frankly if you lost your wallet because of theft or fires, you have more issues to worry about than your bitcoins.
Because there is no regulation, you really can't treat exchanges like a bank. You aren't insured to not lose money. Real fiat banks are insured so the risks of losing money via a fiat bank is low. Take away regulations and insurance and these online crypto exchanges are just strangers who you can only pray won't lose your money.  
So it comes down to comparing the risk of a wallet with backup strategies to an online exchange. Personally, I will continue to trust wallet with backup strategies.

This is exactly what was going through my head.

I just bought some today as well.

Not to mention CCs with 0% promotional APRs.

If you are keeping money in the exchange, it means you want to trade as soon as you see a price you like. Depositing coins to an exchange takes time so active traders will choose to keep coins/money in the exchange. If that wasn't your plan, then I'm not sure why you're keeping money somewhere else to begin with (in which case then yes, stupid). So he was giving you the benefit of the doubt that you weren't stupid/lazy but in fact just greedy.
If your money is in paper/cold storage then you can't access it as quickly.

It's be interesting to know what their business model is. How are they making enough money to give free coins out to people? Ads? Selling our emails as previously mentioned?
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:53:01
From what I've seen, I don't think it was a big deal but some people could be spooked by it.

When I saw this post, I was more thinking about people who put money in  trying to buy the really cheap coins (and I think OP did mean this because he quoted the price of $100 which is after the fiasco).
Yes I feel bad for people who originally trusted gox before their prices came tumbling down because at that point there's a good chance that they might not have known what was going on. What I think the OP is saying is for those people who came in when their prices tumbled thinking they could get a good deal. People thinking they could buy dirt cheap coins and essentially trying to profit off other's mistakes. They got burned and for those people who are just outright greedy, we have no sympathy for them.

If we look at this purely from a financial standpoint then it really is just how much are you willing to gamble? Do you like your odds? Remember that nothing will stop Gox from disappearing with all the money, even if they become solvent.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:15:11
Then the question becomes why? Why would you keep coins with an exchange instead of your own wallet? If you are aware of the risks, fine. But it doesn't seem like everyone is aware of the risks otherwise we wouldn't have had this problem.
If it really comes down to laziness or lack of knowledge then they should get out of this game now and trust their money with a financial adviser because this is not an environment for people who are expecting easy money.

If you need the money, you sell. Bitcoin is a gamble, don't gamble with income that isn't disposable.

Bitcoin should have more longevity than Coin though. At least in Europe, many places now use chip and pin. That is, a chip resides on your credit card such that instead of scanning the magnetic strip, the chip is scanned instead. This technology is slowly moving into the U.S. Already, credit card companies (like Chase) are including the chip on their credit cards.
Coin will have to innovate to somehow incorporate chip technology if they want to remain relavant.
Bitcoin on the other hand does not need major innovation to remain relevant.
