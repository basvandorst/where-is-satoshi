Why would I make this up? Is this not the place to share with people what this bank just did to me?

They hadn't received the wire yet. It was done approximately the same time as they closed my account. Which is why they told I'm going to have to wait for a while until it processes and the send it back rejected. An inconvenience, that's all
I use other banks with Gemini with no problem, so I'm kicking myself in the ass for trying to use Fidelity and sending my money there this time

I'm not into "FUD" with bitcoin, I'm deeply invested. Just a random internet guy giving a heads up on the constantly changing landscape of Nazi banks

I think a lot of my problem was because it was a new account. Maybe they used crypto as an excuse. Others say they don't have a problem using it with coinbase :-/

The service rep said if I was going to use the account for cryptoccurrencies, then they wouldn't allow that. I told her that was fine, I would buy some stocks instead. Then she said the back office decided they were going to keep my account closed and I would be better served somewhere else

Proof of what? That my account was closed?
How about you call fidelity.com customer service yourself and ask. Probably much easier

They must have something against Gemini... Seems some people can still use them with coinbase :-/
