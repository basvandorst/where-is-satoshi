if anyone could ruin bitcoin, it would be trump.
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:42:24
he and the other criminals running the country can set laws that will devalue bitcoin.  and they probably will.  thanks trump.
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:12:35
The good new is, we all know that Trump has a deep understanding of bitcoin technology!

I’m thinking it’s possible that the irs got info from other exchanges that didn’t fight the subpoena. I don’t think we would have heard about it.  Just a theory.

let me take a wild guess..  you're long BCH?
@_date: 2019-07-17 05:36:37
well, it gets traded a lot, thats for sure.
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:18:49
yes but orange man could certainly make it illegal in the U.S.
@_date: 2019-07-26 02:57:39
i think:  you would basically consider it "exchanged" when you moved it to the gambling site.  if you bought BTC at $400 a coin, and it was worth $450 the day you sent it to the gambling site, you had $50 gain.  likewise, you could also have had a loss.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:18:39
thats what i thought.  that what the post above confused me.  the poster seems to be implying that an attacker would need to know your PIN and your words.  but in fact, if they have your words, they don't need your pin.
@_date: 2019-07-24 16:44:45

all shitcoin scams should go to zero.  not sure that's 90% but maybe.  there are plenty of legitimate projects with real teams and real plans.  i think a lot of alts will rise again.  hopefully the crap ones dont.
@_date: 2018-08-22 21:29:10
did you mean to aim the camera a little more to the right?  not sure composition is your strong suit.
@_date: 2018-08-19 23:42:20
the market is manipulated 24x7x365 and you decide to complain about a failed short squeeze? dafuck.
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:16:36
I think most of the volume is short sellers.  They borrow BTC and dump it to buy back lower.  Rinse and repeat.  There seems to be very little buy pressure so the shorts will keep driving down the market to profit. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:34:11
i thought about a Chromebook.
i assume bit address could be loaded via usb and would run ok in Chrome?  
also, printing is really important for me... but i gues i can probably connect my USB printer to the Chromebook?
its an option im exploring for sure.

you expect me to wait nearly 2 years to get my lambo?

not sure what you mean by "sync."  but you can transfer your BTC from coinbase to any wallet you want.

do you know that your link is from Feb 10?  that's like 20,000 years old in BTC time.
@_date: 2018-08-19 23:32:31
are you saying that you are happy the shorts didnt get squeezed?  i hope you lose everything.
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:08:54
if they get low enough, it will be tempting.   part of me thinks they will fix the issue.  no idea why i feel that way.
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:36:42

@_date: 2014-02-16 06:33:07
because there is a shit ton of BTC there (in theory) and it was the largest exchange.  its extremely significant, even if it will some day be history.  how could you ignore it?  its a massive, watershed event.
@_date: 2018-08-18 03:18:09
could you please rewrite that post title so its even more confusing?  thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:37:37
That is an office building, not the hotel.
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:26:31
so then what?  isnt the fiat stuck anyway?  whats the point of trashing the coins?
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:52:46
i dont have any Gox coins.  i just have a spidey sense that the story will be even more bizarre than a theft.
@_date: 2014-06-30 06:41:20
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:50:53
seems like to have a decent bip38 you need a string that is pretty tricky to store in brain only.  does that mean i need an additional strategy to store the passphrase?

I went thru a very similar experience a couple months back.  Buy BTC, not miners.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:34:31
I like it!   But didn't Gox already suggest that this issue was related to malleability?  Why would they use misdirection?

You sound lovely.
@_date: 2014-06-25 05:04:16
ok cool.  i was under the impression that bip38 passwords were supposed to be complex.  it if it can just be one or 2 words, or a few characters, then that works.
@_date: 2014-06-28 05:24:32
ok.  that's an impressive address.

you cant move coins out of Gox.  that fact is at the very center of the Gox issues.

i'm also curious if people set a maximum amount per wallet for extra safety.  spread the coins out among multiple wallets?  i have 50BTC to move offline.

@_date: 2014-06-24 23:02:32

@_date: 2014-10-05 18:29:16
From the perspective of the very first adopters, yes.   But that's not very relevant is it?  Many people are holding bags.
@_date: 2014-06-25 05:10:24
i am, but they will be spread across many wallets.  perhaps 10.

@_date: 2015-01-14 07:37:08
at the rate this thing is plummeting, it could be at $100 tomorrow.  some strange forces are at work.  i think its gox coins, or other stolen coins.  and as it goes lower, there will be further capitulations and more dumping.
its not rational at all.
i plan to buy back when the market feels less creepy.  and yes, it might mean i lose even more.
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:41:18
thats one way to look at it.
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:28:08
i didn't ask you to feel sorry for me.

This might be the dumbest reddit post I've ever seen 
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:25:04
on a percentage basis, i doubt many fiats have had as much theft.  but i haven't done the research.
if i thought billions (trillions?) of dollars could be stolen at any moment, i might hold fewer dollars.

@_date: 2019-03-30 17:03:35
things change.  sometime in unexpected ways.  people get wealthy in unexpected ways.  you don't need to overanalyze it.  we all bring our biases.  bitcoin might fail.  it might replace the dollar. nobody really knows.

why does everyone assume that it's personally identifiable data?
@_date: 2019-11-06 19:02:47
probably you'd be taxed on the dollar value of the coins upon transfer.  also, if the IRS suspects you're playing games, they will watch those coins. so if you spend them or tumble them... excuse me if the \*homeless guy\* tumbles them... then expect a follow up from your new friends at the IRS.
@_date: 2019-03-12 23:20:20
Cool link bro.  See my previous reply.

@_date: 2019-03-31 17:46:58

Sorry to hear you dumped all your coins. You can always buy back in. 
@_date: 2019-03-21 15:30:03
They’ll try to do it for as long as they can, whenever they can. Sometimes they will make money.  Other times the “longs” will come in and ruin their day.  Nobody knows what the price will do next.  Everyone is just making bets. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 01:40:00
until you show me a chart with arbitrary lines drawn on it, i can't weigh in.
@_date: 2018-10-06 06:20:36
you're def. not fucked.  Gemini is not a flight by night operation.  you will get your BTC.  
@_date: 2019-11-06 16:17:12
i think in such a case, it might actually be on you to prove that you did.

@_date: 2019-02-11 00:25:52
LOL.  you calling someone a "retard" (classy by the way) for claiming he knows where price is heading, while at the same time you claim to know where price is headed.  Good luck to you sir.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:06:36
requires a supercomputer to calculate this
@_date: 2019-02-22 20:44:20
Because you can’t claim more than your basis.  Pretty sure that’s how it works.  You losing the coins is like owning a stock that goes to zero.  You can’t claim a loss from the ATH, only what you put in. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:50:27
at least it wasn't more than 3.1k. lots of people get hurt a lot worse.  you'll get another chance.  when you do, don't use leverage. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 20:05:30
I don't think anyone is going to be able to tell you beyond a shadow.  I doubt there is tax code for this scenario.  It's easy to see how people could abuse this.  If it were me, I absolutely would take the loss.  You aren't claiming them stolen (an easier evasion strategy).  You can prove the funds have never moved if you are audited.  At the end of the day, it's true that you lost them.  Just have records to defend your position clearly.  Of course you can only claim your basis (what you paid for the lost crypto), not what they were worth when you lost them.

be careful trying to anticipate the markets.  its almost always better to just hodl. its hard when the markets are flying up and down.  but many (most?) "traders" get their asses handed to them, and the richest people in crypto are those people that simply held onto their coins.

@_date: 2017-11-18 22:46:47
i dont want to recommend anything specifically, because i dont know anything so don't listen to me.  but what i do is look at alts that are below $50M mkt cap, and have real teams and a real use case.  lurk on their forums and chats for a few weeks and see if you like the community and the devs.  there are likely some projects that will 10x from this group. i have a few positions.  some will lose.  hopefully 1 or 2 will win.  there are so many money-grab ICOs that its getting harder.

i personally think this is a pretty tasty trade.  i don't have the patience to wait a year tho, and i think there are better returns available in some alts, etc.  if i was worth a boatload, and had lots of fiat, i would by a lot of this trade.

you dont need to do anything until you sell.  when you sell, you'll report your gain (proceeds minus basis) and whether the gain is long or short (e.g. did you hold for less than or more than 366 days).  but, you should always seek professional tax advice, and not from reddit users.

sure, a lot of people could buy maybe a bitcoin or 2 now.  but that's insignificant compared to those that have thousands of coins (for example true first adopters, and early miners).

@_date: 2015-11-06 07:16:50
you really don't think what happened over the past week is a bubble?  to me, it clearly was.  yes it's not a long period of time, but it was irrational, unsupported price increase that was not sustainable.  i think you gotta call that a bubble.
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:47:58
@_date: 2015-11-12 00:27:29
the past 2 weeks have certainly not helped bitcoin's image
@_date: 2015-11-12 00:21:57
so where do you think all the buy volume came from?  and why do you think it is now gone?
@_date: 2015-11-06 16:04:31
people who care about why bitcoin moved know about MMM.  people who don't care about it don't know (and don't care).   
i believe we go back below $300 before end of year.

perfect money is the future.  gonna make bitcoin look like trading sheep.
@_date: 2015-11-08 01:55:46
yes i've thought about that a lot.  if i mined 20,000 btc in the first days, there's simply no way i'd still be holding those coins without having insane commitment to it.  (or having forgotten i even mined them until recently)
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:34:38
dont you mean doubling the price just before the auction?
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:53:24

it also makes no sense.  saying at the end to sell bitcoin while you still can, after saying it hits a bazillion dollars.  hilarious.

1800 Bitcoins mined per day.  That's like 5 mins of trading vol.  I don't get it.

if i want to make a DIY paper wallet, is it still advisable to use bitcoinpaperwallet.com (or the others) to generate the keys?  i was thinking of creating a fun design but i dont want to mess up the keys and QRs

are you saying that the pattern in the right circle looks like the pattern in the left circle, and so history about to repeat?

What if they bring bigger guns?
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:18:48
are those supposed to be circles?

is creating a "watch only" account different?  can't i check the balance of my offline wallet even if i dont specifically make it 'watch only"?

exactly.  if money is flowing out of S&amp;P and into BTC, there's no way he's not going to do something (imo).

I find the China syndome slightly confusing.  Is the upshot that essentially all the folks trading on Chinese exchanges have to liquidate 100% and go to fiat?  and if so, why are there still trades happening and some price support there (BTC China)?

it's easy after you've been destroyed a couple times and have been taught the lesson that nothing outperforms hodling.  i have no issue at all hodling now.  im sleeping like a baby and waiting for $100k

their head isn't completely in the sand, i would just hate for them to lose the coin over some log-in / encryption issue.  i was thinking it was a gift they would hold onto for a few years.  yes, i know that is "hoarding" but...
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:16:01
put it all in dogecoin.  much rich.  wow.
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:18:57
thanks.  yes i was thinking i would do just that - test bringing a very small amount to paper, then back.  i think once i've done that it will all make a bit more sense and i'll have a bit more confidence to do it with more substantial amounts.
