For 100k worth it'd probably make sense to get someone to build you a site that launches instances for people but keeps the billing with you.

You're completely missing the fact that some people will buy bitcoins explicitly to spend them online. For example people who can't or won't use a credit or debit card.

Majority hashing power has been reached in the past. It doesn't really centralize Bitcoin. It just means that people are super-trusting of that  pool. The one large miner's desire to minimize variance in times of increasing difficulty also seems material as well. In time the difficulty will stop increasing so quickly and other pools will become more competitive, fixing the problem. If there's some malfeasance, Ghash.io will just have dropped the ball.

A big part of what Bitcoin is doing with proof of work is achieving consensus. If a hard limit is set on the length of allowable reorgs, that becomes a vector to split that consensus with no free way to regain it. Splitting consensus is even more dangerous to the network than some amount of double spending or streaks of zero transaction blocks.

Today was an ECB reaction. The rest of the rise is just Bitcoin's natural rise to world domination. Put it this way... if there isn't bad news coming out about Bitcoin, or it hasn't gotten overly dear, its natural tendency is up due to the network effect, all the reasons people want to use it, and its rock-solid scarcity.
Other than that, it's hard to pin it down. The theme of today though is larger companies becoming willing to integrate Coinbase and Bitpay as well as another round of realization that it did find a bottom and didn't die (again).
You guys seriously need to show the USD price on a log chart like this  or this

To your number two, there is no concrete concept of a single from address in Bitcoin. Transactions have inputs and outputs. What most people think of as a from address is one of the addresses to which a transaction's inputs were previously sent. 
It's tempting to use that info but can be misleading. For example refunds to a "from" address may end up in a service's wallet and not the wallet of the user on that service who sent the payment.
