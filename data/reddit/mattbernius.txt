Video of the GlassPay Demo pitch is now online. Note that this is an alpha prototype of the software. A lot of features (including listing prices in Native Currency equivalents) are planned before GlassPay goes into Beta.

It could also be implemented in a grocery store. The nice thing about the platform is it's quite scalable.
All that would happen in a scenario where you're scanning as you pull the item off the shelf is that the store would need to post one employee to check carts as people left. Many stores with self check-out lanes already do this.

Best. Comment. Evah.
(update... -2? Was that for a [possibly tired] Simpsons ref? 'Cause I really did love the comment)

If the products had RFID I could see that working.
Generally speaking I would think a quick bag scan (not a manual unpacking) is all that one would need to make this work.

On the plus side, the team has discussed including a budgeting feature. Right now the app warns you when you're going to exceed what's in your account.

The shoplifting issue is really overblown.
In the US, many retails stores - like Walmart, Sam's Club, and Cosco -- already have someone to check out your cart *after checkout* to ensure everything matches. 
This is especially the case with places that already have self-checkout stations.

Not yet. RedBottle is shooting for limited field tests starting in Q2 of 2014.

The prototype platform just premiered this afternoon at Demo. As soon as they put the video of the on stage demo (done with working software) I'll post it here. You can also eventually find it [here](
