Maybe lend at the cost of default risk?

If we think we know, then we're delusional.

Unless there's a way to guarantee the value of what you lend. Maybe loan with a collateral agreement backed by a home, lending upto 50% LTV that's callable if the LTV exceeds a certain threshold.

All investment requires conviction and faith.  There is no investment that is guaranteed. Probabilities are always at play. Blind spots exist. Unknown unknowns are impossible to model. At the end of the day, all investment involves an element of emotion. Anyone who argues otherwise is ignorant. Invest what you can afford to lose.  Bitcoin is a valid bet due to the asymmetrical upside potential, but it's still a bet.

"The World Gold Council estimates that all the gold ever mined totaled 187,200 tonnes in 2017" and "one tonne of gold has a value of approximately US$40.2 million"
Multiply 187,200 tons x $40,200,000 = 7.6 Trillion. You are right. So $266,000 per bitcoin.

This headline is evidence that people are trying to suppress the truth.

Yes. Typo. Corrected. Thank you.

I completely agree. I think bitcoin is brilliant, but there's a need for a more efficient way to tax bitcoin-to-bitcoin commerce and for the users to easily figure out what we owe. 
We share in the use of many public funded services, infrastructure, schools, courts, healthcare... 
The bitcoin wave is coming, I just hope for a more efficient way to figure out taxes.
Maybe a per transaction tax?
