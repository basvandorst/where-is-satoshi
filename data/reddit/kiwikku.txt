Soon, maybe with a couple more thousand users.
@_date: 2015-06-14 04:43:53
Great, please spread the word.
@_date: 2014-11-16 10:57:15
Go away
@_date: 2014-10-06 00:16:29
It's already happening!
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:28:11
It's not about ethics for me. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 11:23:21
Sidechains add more core functionality that's well-needed.
@_date: 2014-12-10 13:22:22
Bitcoin, is dead. We need a new currency that is STABLE first of all. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 00:52:58
There's no point in arguing with you.
@_date: 2014-11-10 05:11:31
Check out 
@_date: 2015-06-14 18:10:06
I actually proved I was black and blew you guys out months ago. 
I do not try to recruit them to GG anymore.
@_date: 2014-12-10 02:56:28
I agree with you guys, but it's tough.
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:42:20
That's what we're working on.
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:36:00
This is good. We need more people to do this so we can end volatility for GOOD.
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:13:24
Oh, thanks. I like the idea, but I think if this were implemented it'd be a way for us to be the federal reserve- the people finally get to control inflation and monetary policy, together..
@_date: 2014-11-10 01:34:12
The narcissism here is incredible.
That's the point. Gaming is the last stand, your ideology has seeped into nearly everything else. It's literally cancerous.*
Edit, that's probably a little hyperbolic. Still, I have no respect for your methods. I agree with your goals but the ends should never justify the means. You doxx people and drive them from their homes, get them fired for wrongthink. It's disgusting. 
Reviewers are free to talk about whatever issues they want, but it should never affect the score. End of discussion.
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:52:40
Oh look, another goon from GamerNazi.
I'm pretty tired of you guys. It doesn't matter how many times I debunk your arguments, you still come back for more. Anyone who still says that GG is about harassment actually deserves to be made fun of.
 It's a shame my sub didn't take off like I planned, but when you're a member of a "HATE GROUP" things don't always go according to plan.
@_date: 2014-10-30 11:20:13
This is some good news! Perhaps a chance to increase cooperation with Gamergate?
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:46:34
That's a decent point, but we don't have much sway over them. We start small then work up.
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:03:40
Nobody is. But you have to understand, there's been a vicious campaign of bullying and hate against Gamers going on for the last 3 months, and the media's caused it all. KiA would be happy to answer any questions you might have.
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:42:10
I think so. She's bouncing hard man, already bast $300
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:40:31
Because, the fact that a game is "misogynistic" isn't a good reason to stop it from being made. If someone doesn't like something, don't do it. It's that simple.
@_date: 2014-12-10 03:25:56
Maybe you should screencap some! If it's that bad..
So happy I don't have your job.
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:42:47
Innovation? Try a complete overhaul. The way I see it, you need some sort of government. Why not make everyone part of it? Here's what you do. You create a decentralized voting platform. Each bitcoin= 1 vote, but I use the penrose formula to dampen the effect of 51% attacks. The penrose method is where you sqrt the amount of btc someone has to get their voting power. So someone with 9% of the btc has 3% voting power, someone with 4% has 2% and so on. Effectively, you need to control 74% of the computing resources in order to execute it, which is practically impossible.
Now, there are sliders in your that let YOU determine the inflation or deflation rate of the currency, anywhere from -5% to 5%. The algorithm takes all the inputs and averages them together to create new "monetary policy" that's flexible, democratic and inclusive. WE'RE THE CENTRAL BANK. 
Wait, there's more. There's a penalty if you don't vote, and a demurrage of 0.3% per month on coins that are just sitting there. This helps encourage liquidity in the markets, because if you have to lose them or lose them, so to speak. The problem with btc is the hoarding. We need to fix this or it's over.
@_date: 2014-10-06 02:40:37
Maybe we need to make some memes?
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:44:48
The audience pays them, so that'd largely be a good thing. Journalists write about what the audience wants, or they go out of business. Although that is open to abuse.. But some would say it's just advertising. The blockchain is open so anyone can study the data if necessary.
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:44:28
I agree! 
@_date: 2014-12-10 13:23:46
I think it's more a case of lax moderation for ideological reasons.
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:09:22
I love this idea. Real paper wallets, now that's golden.
Still, i'd prefer if they were, you know- printed out and glued together at a central factory, then the codes were destroyed instantly.
@_date: 2014-10-30 11:28:56
I wish we had gone into a depression, maybe we would've finally replaced the entire rotten system. Eternal growth is unsustainable. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 05:31:39
Hope you do well!
@_date: 2014-11-10 01:30:43
I don't think that it's important for games to be considered art unfortunately. I just want to have fun.
@_date: 2014-11-10 06:24:37
That's not me.
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:57:14
Hmm, you actually have a good point. Ending the "reviews are everything" attitude is one of our goals. However, if you need an example of ethical reviews, try Christ Centered Gaming.
@_date: 2014-10-30 11:22:40
It's good to see you guys getting it together.
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:06:45
The era of giant bitcoin bubbles is over. 
Frankly, it couldn't come soon enough. 
We either make this into a true currency or we can keep holding on. We need to build from the ground up by doing yard sales and community services with this too.
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:04:59
You're from GamerGhazi. I don't take kindly to trolls, not one bit. 
What do you have to say, besides "harassment" and "misogyny"?
GAMERGATE HAS BEEN EXPRESSLY DESIGNED TO HARASS WOMEN 
THATS IT
THERE IS LITERALLY NO OTHER PURPOSE
3 MILLION TWEETS, ALL ABOUT HARASSING WOMEN
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN JOIN IN FIGHT TO HARASS WOMEN
Do you people even realize how ridiculous (and frankly stupid) you sound? 
I've debunked your claims dozens of times but you people are too blind to see anything that challenges your narrow worldview. There's not too much of a conversation to be had. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:23:22
No we aren't. The media is lying about us and these people let it happen. Go over to KiA. Ask a few questions. You'll see their entire false narrative crumble before your very eyes.
@_date: 2014-12-10 13:23:16
I can see this.
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:02:56
We see that a lot in r/kotakuinaction as well.
@_date: 2014-12-20 05:38:38
Whoa. Can't wait till that happens, you can count me in!
If I were an engineer :(
@_date: 2014-10-06 02:54:37
Welp, this whalebear sacrificed herself for the greater good.
She's goin down..
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:46:03

The game reviewers' scores directly effect developer pay. If one site gives a game a terrible score, the developer could go out of business.
That's why we need to keep politics out.
@_date: 2014-10-06 03:38:31
All we really need to do is regulate ourselves by creating binding contracts and rules for the exchanges and making our own quasi-governmental agencies.. it's not that hard.
Leave big govt and their filthy fiat out of this.
@_date: 2014-11-09 17:59:40
Bitcoin is beautiful.
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:25:50
Take a look at this person's post history. 
Go to r/gamerghazi, where they will ban you for even thinking of posting a pro-gamergate opinion. 
Then go to our subreddit, where we openly let trolls and provocateurs in, because we embrace debate. See what we have to deal with? 
Don't let people like this carry the day, because they are wrong. They are completely and utterly wrong. And it pains me to see so many falling for it. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 03:29:38
When I say "Gamergate doesn't exist", i mean that metaphorically. I'm saying that this terrible hate mob that harasses women is a complete fabrication made up. It's a lie. And I hate liars. 
I can't wait until we expose the people responsible for the bigoted hypocrites they are.
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:23:50
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:11:17
We don't need this to be public, but an under the radar partnership would be helpful. At least to send emails and build the website.
@_date: 2014-11-10 03:59:40
Just looked up your post history.
Remind me why i'm talking to you again?
@_date: 2014-11-09 18:03:18
I guess so.
@_date: 2014-11-10 03:58:52
Help, we're getting brigaded.
@_date: 2014-10-27 23:48:46
They do that for code compliance, I know, it is stupid.
@_date: 2014-11-10 01:48:49
It's not misogyny if the game is bad.
What you don't understand is that we're colorblind while you revel in the shallow. Diversity of skin color, sex, orientation, all that doesn't matter. 
The only thing that matters is diversity of thought, diversity of the mind. If I suddenly can't criticize someone because they're "marginalized" then that's racist. I don't want a game with a female protagonist if it's just like all the others. I want a game with a good story. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:45:49
I'm going to slel
@_date: 2014-12-10 01:35:16
I was wondering.. Does this place even have mods?
@_date: 2014-10-30 11:18:09
This is something new.
@_date: 2014-12-20 05:35:56
Bitcoin is too volatile. We need to replace it with something more stable.
@_date: 2014-11-10 03:44:13
This place is filled with trolls.
@_date: 2014-12-10 13:22:01
That's sad but true. I could invent a better coin though.
@_date: 2014-09-28 19:52:57
Good question. I think we need to play up the freedom aspect of things. I support tangible BTC, and making everyone their own little money machine.. 
Imagine if you could print out as much money as you wanted, right at home! It's be great.
All you need is some paper and some ink and bam! This fact alone could help. 
Cryptographically-secure single-denomination paper wallets could do that. In effect, they're money. They're tangible. When people can hold bitcoin in their hand, we might be able to start seeing real adoption. But I think it's best to start on a local level and network within your community.
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:40:43
That's terrible, but as a GG supporter i've heard your party line a million times, and I can't help but laugh because it's all so off-topic. 
The fact that people have been harassed is bad, but what do you want me to do about it? I didn't do anything, so no, i'm not going to apologize. 
Gamergate supporters have been sent actual knives and syringes in the mail. You want to talk harassment? Be prepared to accept that it occurs on both sides and our side has it far worse than you do.
Or are death threats suddenly okay when they happen to men? 
This is why nobody should take SJWs seriously. They will twist anything to fit their narrative.
@_date: 2014-11-10 01:01:55
The infamous bayonetta two review for starters. If you want to discuss the social issues of a game that's fine, but keep it out of the score. You're effecting developers' artistic freedom. 
And no, scantily clad women aren't a "problem". Just because some people feel offended doesn't make their opinion worth any more than others. The only opinion that matters is the one with $$$ behind it. 
People are angry because SJWs don't actually do anything. They just complain, loudly. Instead of creating new things they only want to change or destroy what already exists. They literally add nothing of value.
I would welcome more female game designers in the industry- but a top-down approach of yelling "gamers are dead" and shouting muh soggy knees isn't the way to do it. A bottom-up approach is the better path. 
You can't deny that many of the publications involved in the attack had SJW leanings. Bringing political nonsense into games was a horrible idea. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 00:13:54
She doesn't have anything to do with it. What are you trying to imply? 
GG doesn't focus on anyone, because Gamergate doesn't exist. A bunch of people using a hashtag doesn't create some movement. Blame the individuals, not everybody. 
And we don't focus on those people. Really, most of your arguments are terrible and I don't have the time to respond to them as they've been debunked thousands of times. There's no point anyway, nothing I say will change your mind.
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:12:16
Yes. Actually going down even lower to $10 would be good, let's try to hold the value at least stable (all this volatility is kinda silly)
@_date: 2014-10-06 03:42:46
I don't think so.. when the walls came down earlier the price shot up to $330.
@_date: 2014-12-10 01:35:26
but why
@_date: 2014-11-10 01:35:26
Lol, that's funny! You have it more or less right, but if you want the full story ask KiA.
@_date: 2014-11-10 01:34:53
It's bad because it wasn't labelled as an Op-ed. We also discovered a secret mailing list. And 12 articles on the same day? Come on.

@_date: 2014-11-10 00:42:51
That's the thing: Gamergate isn't about ethics in journalism. It's not about any one thing. Everyone is there for their own reasons. 
SJWs are a major problem because they're the source of most of the corruption. They're no better than the christian right extremists for the most part.
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:43:28
Thanks for the tip mate!
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:12:39
It was intended to show the harassment gamers have recieved.
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:00:24
You might want to look up the venus project.
@_date: 2014-11-10 03:43:43
Why don't you look up this idiot?
@_date: 2014-11-10 04:50:13
Nothing you've posted is correct.
Gamergate isn't a harassment campaign- it's a hashtag. 
Our side has received far more harassment than the other, and we've criticised Sam Biddle for his pro-bullying tweets as well. 
I think you don't have the full story. You've been lied to essentially, it's time you learn the truth. 
We donated over 70K to a femininst charity just TO get more women in gaming.
Thousands of women and minorities have come out in support of Gamergate. 
Truth is, your harassment narrative is toxic and a lie. It's hurting real people. You need to stop. Less than 1% of the tweets on the tag were actually sent towards any of the "victims". The math doesn't lie.
@_date: 2014-11-10 03:26:49
That doesn't make it right.
@_date: 2014-12-10 01:47:32
Yeah! I'm sending you a PM now.
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:11:39
That sucks but I understand
@_date: 2014-11-10 23:00:47
I'm beyond caring what you think.
@_date: 2014-11-10 01:04:37
Which status quo? The main reason we're focusing on reviewers is because they're the ones responsible for the gamers are dead attacks.
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:24:14
People. This is sad for me to say, but there's only one way to save bitcoin. We NEED to transfer to a proof-of stake system, not this expensive proof-of-work thing. 
Mining will soon be unprofitable. Not just that, but the new merchants that accept bitcoin immediately are converting it into fiat, putting a relentless downward pressure on the price... If we don't do something now, our big bitcoin dreams will all come crashing down. 
These are the FACTS. BTC has been going down for 2 months straight and it's not getting any better. We need to take drastic measures guys... 
A proof of work system is easier. Or, better yet tell the miners to STOP MINING BITCOINS. We need some deflation here. 
Better yet, just stop with all this bubble stuff. If you want to grow bitcoin, we should do it slow and steady. There aren't going to be anymore bubbles. People don't trust the volatility after the GOX fiasco. We need to earn that confidence back. 
We're doing it wrong- expecting merchants to accept it. Instead, we should try and get it into the communities at a local business/farmers market/yardsale level. Bottom up, not top down. The choice is yours.
@_date: 2014-11-10 22:54:51
Don't care that much.
@_date: 2014-11-10 02:03:37
Welcome, you misspelled that though.
@_date: 2014-10-30 11:21:56
Don't be this way.
@_date: 2014-11-25 23:19:24
Wish it wasn't so stretched out though.
@_date: 2014-11-10 05:30:04
Full disclosure:
I actually don't care that much about ethics in gaming journalism, since I don't play video games. I'm more focused on the group dynamics and strategy portion.
@_date: 2014-11-10 05:41:10
Somewhat. I'm against extreme feminism, but support equality.
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:46:04
No, not currently. The extant Games media is pushing a political agenda and insulting it's audience for the pushback it's recieving. It scores some objectively bad games higher just for having a "progressive" agenda. 
See here:

I also have one more question about bitcongress- do you guys plan on having support for delegative democracy? (where you can delegate your vote to others)
@_date: 2015-02-15 05:31:46
404'd on me! But nice joke ;D
@_date: 2015-02-15 01:02:04
Technically, we already have those issues with absentee ballots. Perhaps the voting software would only allow you to vote in "public places", as tagged via geolocation. Personally, I see nothing wrong with people selling their vote- it's theirs after all. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 02:01:53
In that case, we could allow people to see their voting results only in certain public polling places- and allow people to edit their vote as many times as they want before the polls close. Estonia does something similar.
@_date: 2015-02-15 01:02:44
NICE. Didn't know about that, I will be adding them to my contact folder.

How do offline algorithms know that their key hasnt been generated already?

Good, I was worried. Why is the twitter so inactive then? If you know the team, I would stress how important it is to keep an active presence on social media. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 01:35:42
Why doesn't a private organization just start making biometric IDs and build an ecosystem around that? 
It would be very easy to do, but you would need a live video interview to prove your identity.
