I exited the fraudulent bankster system as soon as I understood the Bitcoin bloodless silent revolution.
I have been storing the value issued to me monthly from my meagre income in BTC for more than 5 years already. 
It has been storing that value adequately enough for a guy who is more than happy to be able to NOT take part in THEIR blood soaked system - because I can !!! 
One thing has become very clear to me:
While Umerca argues whether anyone uses Bitcoin or not, out here in the world it is getting easier and easier to use for direct commerce. Especially now with instant transactions on lightning wallets.

You are missing the point completely.
The whole 'first mover' narrative is borrowed from marketing circles in relation to a corporate product or service. 
Bitcoin is neither of those.
Also, the ONLY reason that people all over the world are enamoured with Bitcoin is that it is bossless.
As much as Umerca have been well rehearsed into trusting corporate suits and even worship them, the REST OF THE PLANET is very dubious of suits - having been burnt may times over.
No one outside of Umerca will be willing to trade the old boss (banksters) with the new boss (slick Web site and team of the latest crypto project).
But everyone on the planet is excited by the idea of finally having a bossless and transparent medium of exchange.
This is what makes Bitcoin special.

Usual meaningful response. 
I would suggest, that instead of redirecting the anger you feel at yourself for having been duped by the bcash scams at others who didn't, that you take a moment and forgive yourself, they were very sophisticated, you weren't the only one. 
Accept it as a mistake - to be human is to err - and move on. Do something productive, earn some BTC instead of 'buying it. Anything. It is time to move forward.

EVEN Bitcoin before custodial web wallets and then HD wallets making SPV wallets a thing.
Remember having to download Bitcoin cli and having to do every thing with command strings? My grand ma had a ball with that.
I think the poster comes from that demanding consumerist mindset that simply doesn't understand how open source development works and why it has been proven to be the best form of development for the commons instead of something directed by corporations.
These people gravitated to the corporate bcash Corp coin project because they want it NOW, there has to be SOMEONE IN CHARGE. Where's the 'road map', we have to 'on-board' users. 
The need for some kind of corporate promise to be delivered on was always there behind their misunderstanding of the tech.
I laugh at the indignance express by these consumer oriented thinkers, but find it tragic that  with a tiny bit of study instead of parroting false narratives on rbtc, they would discover the magic of open source development. And not just how it relates to Bitcoin.

I'm pretty sure I won't be buying 6 a year just to keep a node running. After 3 years, I'll have 20 hard drives jacked into each other. Sounds way too complex.
Running a BTC node with a LN is way easier. I can stick with a new hard drive every 10 years that way.
@_date: 2019-03-15 04:06:47
I love the constant repeating of catch lines you guys like to repeat - 'cripple the network'.
It's funny in it's predictability.
Non-mining full nodes have been shown to be EXTREMELY important when a bunch of suits get together and try to take over the open source aspect of the project's development.
As much as you are willing to trust your venerable leaders, which is fine, it simply is NOT what Bitcoin is about.
What cripples the network is convincing people that only mining nodes are important and users (second class citizens) should only use SPV wallets , which are validated by 3 supernodes. The ability to censor transactions is the ultimate corporate wet dream. This model supports that corporate vision.
I understand people feeling insecure in this new trustless paradigm and wanting someone at the helm to make decisions for them. It is how things have always been. It's a hard shift in your world view.  I applaud you for having a go at the permissioned corpcoin experiment through both bcash forks, but Bitcoin itself is a completely different experiment in trustlessness.
Right now I could propagate bcash 2K blocks on an old Atari computer from the 70s. That is true, but relying on HD capacity to magically beat the 1nM physical limitation so that storage capacity can increase by 3 orders of magnitude, would be a profligate use of my understanding of technological development.
I'll leave that to the corporate coins to figure out.
@_date: 2019-03-21 02:51:13
You are correct BTC is down 80% from ATH, in relation to fiat price, but bcash is another 80% down in relation to the BTC price.
Have you considered that 97% down is a mere 3% from nada - ZERO value?
There's a reason there's a mass exodus from BCH of previous gullible believers. The truth is seeing them free.

I see, you prescribe to Roger math.
He's a great salesman and natural marketer, but his math is pretty funny.
Believe me, it will be far easier to 'on-board' users with lightning and many other second layer possibilities than it will to buy a new hard drive every 5 days just to keep the thing going.
And yes, I've seen the corporate disinformation that only mining nodes are important. And that is true, of you are a miner wanting total control of bcash.
 But Bitcoin is a consensus driven animal where the users also have a say in how the protocol functions, you know, being leaderless and open source and all.
And users will most likely not be able to buy a new hard drive every 5 days, even if they really really wanted to.

No one EVER said that LN is the be all and end all solution to 'onboard' the world.
It is however a super exciting and very creative technology that can on-board the most people out of any currently existing crypto technology.
The second layer and third layer possibilities are making the dream of scaling Bitcoin possible.
So, we can waste time pontificating if the LN solution can do it or not all day long.
No one in the Bitcoin community is relying on one solution at the exclusion of others. LN is.Just one very effective approach.
@_date: 2019-03-21 02:47:47
Most of your concerns have begun adequately addressed in the comments that follow it. Has the community help you received alleviated your concerns?
Also, keep in mind that unlike BCH Corp, Bitcoin is an open source collaborative effort with thousands of developers, as is lightning.
Open source collaborations belong to no one, yet to every one. They are impossible to control as claimed by the disinformation that is wilfully spread by the same 30 desperate daily (all day long) posters that dominate all threads on rbtc.
These are all corporate narratives and catch phrases that sound good to anyone that has not looked into how things actually function because corporations know that most people don't have the time and patience to look into facts, so they can just drive narratives with lots off astro turfing.
Lightning network will be seamless in the user experience. It'll all happen in the background. Open source developments are constantly developed 24/7, not just during corporate office hours. Every single issue you see is being addressed by a huge developer force.
Some people want someone in charge, a road map, the product delivered on time as promised, things to be properly managed etc.
These people gravitate towards the bcash Corp coin project because it is just so much easier to direct from above, behold the 'dev team' to deadlines, provide a road map and make it happen.
But the short history of open source collaboration has already shown that open source development eventually delivers the best result, without any corporate compromises. 
It is why BTC and LN just keep chugging forward, they don't even know there is flak, they are too busy developing and moving it forward.
As a result, those of us interested in sound money for the world, prefer open source development, which we can watch, be a part of and verify directly. On the other hand, those who don't care about or understand sound money, with The consumer mindset want a PRODUCT, that's a few cents cheaper and fast (while sacrificing security and trustlessness).
Please take the time to view the first 7 minutes and 30 seconds of this YouTube clip to understand the mechanism of open source collaboration. It is very interesting.

Can someone please post my response to and explain that I'm banned now
This would mean BTC is not the Real Bitcoin?
My understanding is that the devs for btc didn't believe it could scale as it was originally designed by it's ingenious inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. Their solution to preserve the decentralization aspect of bitcoin was to limit the ability of it to scale, and encourage people to use 2nd layer technology such as Lightning network to scale for the masses.
Another large faction of bitcoiners thought this was nuts, and had faith in the original design so they forked off and that's what became BCH and now also BSV. This is why some make the argument these coins are more like the original bitcoin because they stick to the original plan to scale by increasing the blocksize limit.
The strange thing is that Lightning network eliminates many of the qualities that makes Bitcoin so great. The more it scales, the more centralized it will become - which is also ironic. There are many technical arguments that show that it will not scale due to fundamental routing problems that have not been solved. Also Ironic.
Of course poster will leave out the fact that bcash is a bosscoin, which was started by power hungry corporations that failed in taking over the development of Bitcoin, that it is a failed experiment and is completely controlled by corporate interests, The 'large faction' of Bitcoiners who followed the fork amounts to the same 20 people reposting the same disinformation to each other on rbtc, and that as much as they jump up and down about supposed 'flaws of LN', it is all they can seem to talk about, without ever having even tried it out.
Anyway, long story short: while BTC has an increasing daily transaction rate, very low on chain fees, a massive dev contributor base, an exponentially growing LN second layer solution that is functioning, somehow for these bcash bagholders,  LN doesn't work, the base layer is crippled, the devs are controlled by a tiny little compAny called Blockstream etc.
They are lost in disinformation repeater land.

That it attracted too many give-it-to-Me-NOW people that were easy to fool by the big corporations who convinced these gullible uninformed fools that a Corp coin version would just be easier to control. SOMEONE HAS TO BE IN CHARGE, WHERE'S THE ROAD MAP?
It was easy to suck millions from these ignorant gullible parrots into the bcash Corp coin scam.
The losses have been monumental, there is a lot of disillusionment in that group. You can feel the fear and desperation in the rbtc sub, with the same 30 user names dominating every single 'discussion' on every thread of every post.
They are clutching at straws to try to justify why things didn't go the way the corporate interests promised them, instead of just chalking up their mistake - of being sucked in by corporate narratives, and moving on, more wiser to the corporate agenda.
There is a flood of bcashers exiting BCH, so the daily fear, shit posting, fear and disinformation is at its peak on rbtc.
I think relatively soon it will be a BTC sub again, because outside of the few disinformation posters and the usual user names you see consoling each other all day long, there's nothing going on there at all.

The creation of the Bitcoin is decentralized and always will be due to the collaborative open source nature of it's development.
If other entities find ways of providing a 'centralized' service, it is still way less harmful than the permissioned creation of wealth that we see in the current financial system.
Also, beware the corpcoin scams or there that actually are centralized on the base layer, bosscoin like bcash. They will incessantly rave on about how blue wallet is custodial, yet their entire chain was created by corporate interests who control every aspect of it to this day.
Very bizarre situation.

Every single miner I know, which granted is not THAT many, but probably more than most people would, has refused to sell any freshly minted Bitcoin since the price has dipped below 15K. They are just holding on until the price recovers and using fiat funds from the ATH to cover costs.

Again, probably not for you. The corporate narratives coming from bcash Corp coin have become ludicrous and increasingly desperate.
There used to be one about '18 months' because the bcash users don't understand how open source software development functions and they need SOMEONE IN CHARGE to provide a road map and BEHOLD their corporate development team to fulfil the road map to a dead line.
Someone somewhere along the line estimated that lightning network was about 18 months out, but seeing that BTC and LN are open source collaborations where software gets developed before our very eyes, there is actually no one in charge to make such a promise.
The Bitcoin users who gravitated to the corporate promises of the bcash owners, simply can't fit the idea of open source development and how it operates into their brains, so they had this 'in 18 months' thing going on. They simply couldn't get past it.
It was really silly as it clearly showed how bad the misunderstanding of Bitcoin and its development runs in that consumer minded group of people. They literally view crypto as a PRODUCT.
They literally feel more comfortable with one person in charge under a corporate structure, corporate controlled development, centralized mining, taking no part in consensus (because in a corporate top down system, running a full non mining node has the potential to hinder the corporate objective of total control) and having all of their transactions (all 20k per block worth) 'verified' by 3 super nodes, which are all controlled by the same entity. As long as they get their cheap, fast,  no confirmation transactions, they don't care about using a corporate, centralized private currency and a bloated blockchain.
I was talking about that.

Nope. Quite the opposite. Every effort is made to obfuscate and lead people to believe there's more than one Bitcoin which scares the new user into buying the imposter coin.
If the site simply was more clear, like referring to BCH as Bitcoin cash and BTC as Bitcoin,  it would be ok, but the 'Bitcoin core' thing is incredibly disingenuous. The noob, never having heard of it and seeing it for the first time at Bitcoin.com and referenced no where else on the internet, naturally gravitates to the default which is off course bcash.
The people I know who have been victim of this deception, have all ended up hating bcash.
There's a reason why no one likes it.

Here's the list and post that got me banned:
Yup, got a small list of the regular full timers ...
I think you'll find that as rampant as it seems, it is being driven by a minority of either paid shills or confused bag holders consoling each other from being 97% down. Remembering that that is only 3% away from nada - ZERO value.
You'll probably find this thread fill up very quickly with posts parroting the same tired false narratives from the following list:

Jessquit should 'jus quit'. She pretends to be concerned and engages conversation, but then spots the usual corporate narratives.
Kain_niak is just brain damaged and Ant-n cannot tolerate commenters who provide sources for their opinion.
They may be sincere, but that makes it even more sad that they'd be posting that utter nonsense 24/7.

I got a DM from another user asking me to repost my short list of the top 30 full time posters on the hijacked sub.
I got so much gold and silver for this post, but immediate ban as well. Very odd to get swamped in gold and silver and banned for the same comment.
Anyone who spends more than half an hour there will notice the same false messages being posted over and over again by the same user names.
You'll recognize these names.

So you are begging BTC for the fees charged you by a bankster backed known enemy of Bitcoin?
In that same time period, I never paid more than $4. Admittedly, one transaction was stuck for a few days. 
Now, to the present.
Transactions are at about the same level now and I am getting into the next block for less than 10 cents. I've opened 5 LN channels, which will probably never need closing, at 2 cents each. 300 transactions later, I'm literally paying fees waaaay less than any alt coin.
From $4 to 10 cents. Would you say that something is working? 
Maybe having thousand of the brightest minds in the space collaborating voluntarily has some merit.
Conbase AND there shenanigans are not representative of BITCOIN.

I'm Used to this treatment on the hijacked sub before I got banned for not towing the corporate line.
But on this sub, people are generally civil with each other.

THE VAST MAJORITY.
There's over 60 million users, with a million a month jumping on. And they ain't from Umerca.
You and your friends didn't listen to the advice that Bitcoin is NOT an investment and buy only what you can afford to lose. Instead you listened to the corrupt lame stream media, who told you it is an investment.

Bcash cry baby that can't understand consensus or do math.
The censorship is rife at rbtc. The only sub I've ever been banned on.
All it took was to expose the obvious paid user names. Got a ton of gold and silver AND banned for the same comment.

So disingenuous.
Look, I transact In Bitcoin every single day. Like I actually use it as peer 2 peer cash.
It is easy to use and other than during the corporate spam attacks, has always been easy to use.
Do you even transact, or are you just repeating the tired corporate bcash narratives?

Utter bullshit. Do you even transact ever?

No. There is no threat.
 The segwit X2 corporate takeover attempt was real and a very scary threat. Each passing day makes bcash more and more of an embarrassment to the few remaining holders.
50 people repeating lame corporate narratives back and forth 24/7 in the desperate and irrelevant hijacked sub, are ineffectual fools at best.

There was no 'debate'.
In Bitcoin consensus is achieved by nodes, both mining and non mining, individually choosing which client software to run.
There was a handful of people who didn't understand this that had been swayed by corporate propaganda (from the corporate interests behind the failed corporate takeover attempt off the NYA, HKA and segwitX2), who thought that by debating on a Reddit sub, somehow SOMEONE IN CHARGE would increase the blocksize, which (because of the false corporate narratives they believed in) was the best way forward.
The node operators on the other hand, who are all too familiar with the challenges involved in maintaining a node, using their brains and their calculators, doing some pretty simple arithmetic, arrived at the very logical conclusion that the corporate wishes to increase the block size would marginalize them and give these corporations too much control over Bitcoin.
They 'voted' not by some sort of debate, which would then be decided and implemented by SOMEONE IN CHARGE, but by choosing the client that did not wantonly and recklessly just increase the block size.
In this way, as per Bitcoin's very design, Consensus was achieved to continue with a limited blocksize (for the time being) and find more creative ways to increase transaction throughout per second.
The butthurt corporations, which failed in their takeover attempt, where for the first time in human history, the users wishes trumped corporate interests, got all indignant and arrogantly went to 'plan bcash' and forked off, thinking they could convince the world that their corporate controlled fork IS the real Bitcoin.
It all backfired badly for them.
Because of this unprecedented human victory over corporate manipulation, millions of people standing on the sidelines, in disbelief that Bitcoin really was anti fragile to corporate forces, jumped on board and we experienced the famous and insane run-up in price from 2K to 20K, while the forked corpcoin chains failed dismally and spectacularly, continuing to plummet to this day, even with an incredible amount of corporate propping up, fraudulent tricks (Saint Bitts LLC) and disinformation campaigns.
In short, ignore the corpcoin phenomena. Bitcoin is the first and ONLY bossless medium of exchange in human history. Sell and Convert as much fiat as you are willing to lose, commensurate with your understanding of Bitcoin the technology and Bitcoin the silent bloodless revolution.

You've had great advice from many commenters explaining about the difference between hiding your own bitcoin and having them with a 3rd party, in your case finance.
As you seem relatively new or not-yet-informed, I'd like to point out to you to be very careful of Bitcoin wannabes Corpcoins like 'Bitcoin cash' - commonly known as bcash. They are a corporate controlled blockchain that has zero security and is attempting to fool the world into thinking that it IS Bitcoin, where they will ultimately end up being a real third party in every transaction.
Educate yourself about Bitcoin. Why it is the first and ONLY bossless medium of exchange in world history. A great start is to Watch all clips on Andreas Antonopoulos YouTube channel. 
Just a heads up.
@_date: 2019-09-20 02:45:16
Well you should have known the difference between the core Ferrari and the cash Ferrari.
And after extensive research seen that even no one in the world calls the cash Ferrari the REAL FERRARI, there's this lonely corner of the internet where the same fifty user names repeat over and over that the cash Ferrari is the REAL FERRARI, and it IS the Ferrari sub, so it must be true.
Dumb fool. You deserve what happened to you.

That someone is selling bcash at Bitcoin price is not implied at all. That would be direct fraud.
What is happening is more subtle, but it is still grossly dishonest.
What is implied and happens often, especially to non native English speakers, is that they buy bcash thinking that it IS Bitcoin, when it isn't that at all. The corporate false narratives abound about bcash being tHe rEaL BiTcOiN, so upon 'researching' they get even more misled. Again, this affects non native English speakers the most. They are the most vulnerable.
Look at it this way, why is THE Bitcoin dot con THE ONLY place on the internet where there are 2 Bitcoin, this fictitious 'core' and this 'cash'?  If the intention is not to mislead people, with non native speakers not equipt to see past it, why is Saint Bitts LLC even bothering with this blatant display of lack of integrity?
Argue for it all you like. It still doesn't explain WHY they would do that other than to INTENTIONALLY mislead people.
@_date: 2019-09-30 07:34:30

Miners were paying the 'fee' to themselves. There was little cost in that sense.
The corporations behind the segwit X2 takeover attempt of Bitcoin who forked their own Corp coin version from Bitcoin, were such cry babies. 
They attempted to make people believe Bitcoin was 'crippled', so they spammed like crazy to 'price to the world' that their corporate fork is Bitcoin.
It all failed shop miserably.
