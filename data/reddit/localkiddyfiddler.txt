They're just normal people, no matter what you won't convince them to Bitcoin until a nice man in a shiny suit will them at their bank that Bitcoin is okay which will happen never. These people think that they have to work for someone in order to make money and live their small little life.

People on the Internet laugh at normal people but they have have also weird perspective about things that is not their field.

I sold 100 LTC for 10$ few years ago, half of it deposited to my bank with half bought alt coins and got scammed by Cryptsy. Unfortunately I didn't have my glass ball.

To make money for us holder, if you won't buy Bitcoin then us holders won't get the profits because the price won't rise. Buy Bitcoin, You have to believe in Bitcoin, put all the skeptic thoughts aside and buy Bitcoin, thinking is never good, buy Bitcoin,  you just have to belive and everything will be allright, buy Bitcon.

It's technology, technology is shifting fast as fuck. Not long ago we didn't know that destroying(hard fork) first mined Bitcoins of Satoshi Nakamoto was possible or guessing it's private keys. Who knows what we will learn in next few years, maybe it will be allright from now on, maybe not. Cryptocurrency definitely is not some fidget spinner mania and definitely the idea will survive but the only question is how it will evolve.

I don't get it, why just don't kidnap someone who lives in a villa? isn't that the most sure thing that he has tons of cash?

If shit like this happen then it probably gonna last like a second so you basically need to hold money on currency exchange with an open offer.

Well, that's like 99% that do this. Most people investing in Bitcoin do this to never work again, even the creator said that it's more like gold or silver rather than a currency in his earlier posts.

And what I see on the front page there? a price in dollars LOL and of course sellers probably exchange Bitcoin for dollars ASAP when you pay them.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:22:44

@_date: 2018-03-19 17:48:19


Fuck man... 8,3k now. From this boredom I'm browsing old ass posts. Whole coinmarketcap is green now but for me it's still red until it won't at least double on price.
