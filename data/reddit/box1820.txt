try this multi coin one 
@_date: 2014-04-25 06:15:59
nope we have a good stock of them. they wanted to promote it at my space since we hold the bitcoin nyc meetups there. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 03:52:56
50/50 really... cuz at night time its going to be a bitcoin party. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 14:43:03
perfect timing rob! .. check my other post. i emailed u
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:40:50
which comic is this 
@_date: 2014-11-20 20:56:42
its pretty sad that the NXT marketplace isn't getting the attention it deserves. surprisingly its the first live production ready decentralized marketplace... honestly, nxt is hidden gem among all these coins. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 15:52:28
what do you mean?
@_date: 2014-06-15 04:40:23
lol... i'll get them to play this at the DJ booth at the fair. 
@_date: 2014-04-26 21:30:32
more details will be in the coming weeks. its in nyc. yes they take bitcoin for booth space. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:04:25
it's still in development.. no one takes Bitcoin yet. hoping to launching sometime in June
@_date: 2014-08-06 04:39:17
yes its definitely alarming on an adoption level as this is something that should be solved when trying to pitch to new vendors. if vendors aren't tech savvy and also dont have access to quick support, there is no way in hell they will learn to use this thing... 
@_date: 2014-12-02 17:36:16
the nxt platform would be the easiest to manipulate as it has a bunch of things you can tap into. messaging / marketplace / stock market / aliases 
@_date: 2014-11-20 15:13:00
meant more as a gift for family and friends that want to put on display. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:44:03
NXT just updated their platform with a new decentralized silk road marketplace. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:43:55
awesome time
@_date: 2014-11-26 15:32:56
i think u guys left out the big elephant in the room in your comparison: NXT  --- having that they pretty much owned every 2.0 platform out there, its no wonder its not getting mentioned. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:29:06
just misinformed.
@_date: 2014-05-20 15:11:09
ok updated! thx
@_date: 2014-05-17 19:58:05
video link would be nice .. thats if they even recorded it.
@_date: 2014-09-12 23:59:30
not shipping to restricted countries... thats just playing with fire. I meant banned visa/mastercard countries where there is high fraud rates.
@_date: 2014-05-20 14:52:22
will do! thx for the tip.
@_date: 2014-06-14 03:51:44
thats just a basic example. try to explain mining in 30 seconds without mentioning all the crazy jargon it comes with.

@_date: 2014-05-20 14:50:41
yea, we just want to get a head count of people coming out. also you have to rsvp if you want the goodie bag at the fair. we got down a bakery that's going to make dogecoin macaroons, but thats only if we get enough funding.
aside from just the vendors at the fair, we'll be doing a Bitcoin conference style meetup with speakers coming out to support the cause and also an area for bitcoin social networking while having some beers. 
Sponsors funds and funding from the community will be used for kickbacks and marketing vendors that decide to take on bitcoin. 
right now we have an issue with the adoption rates as most btc holders are just holding on to their bitcoins and vendors have no incentive to take it as a form of payment. the solution to this is to provide such a good deal when purchasing a product you would rather pay in btc than usd. and then vendors will have no choice to adopt btc or else they would lose the sale completely. 
What we have in the works is having a bar accept btc, but charge only .001 for drinks and the difference would be covered by the sponsors up to a point of course. This would get users using btc and bar owners accepting btc. 
its alot more stuff we're planning to launch at the event. its not going to be your regular fair or bitcoin conference. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 15:00:17
Great we need all the help we can get... the guys from blockchain are down to help out. Bitpay is also on board so far. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 03:51:05
We're currently working out the logistics on getting every vendor on board using Bitpay. We are aiming to launch sometime this coming June. Right now we're building out sponsorship opportunities and we should have an official announcement in the coming week or so. It's going to be awesome! We (xcubicle) are spear heading alot of the logistic and education hurdles to get this going smoothly for everyone. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:28:47
im assuming these stores are going to have to Bank ACH transfer the funds back to you while they get to keep a fee for themselves. what is the sell limit of a store? i'd imagine it would raise red flags as potentially large amounts of funds would be going in and out of the business owners bank accounts. ur bank account can get frozen if they detect large inflow/outflows like this. too risky for small business owners, imo.

bit pricey for shops. we're just using it for the fair.. hanging it in the front gate. we'll see alot of people taking photos with it thats for sure. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 18:55:10
its not easy explaining bitcoin mining to non-technical folks in "30" seconds. Try explaining mining in 30 seconds WITHOUT any of the technical terms. aka: hash, sha256, network, confirmation, blocks, nounce, etc. i think this is one of the simplest analogies for a regular person to understand. this is how bobby lee from btcchina explained it. if you have a better one let me know.

announcement here: 
@_date: 2014-06-02 17:25:35
We would love to give your mags away at the upcoming NYC Bitcoin Fair ... Right now we have about over 100 bitcoin attendees + the usual 300-500 people that come for the regular fair that day. so its going to be good exposure for the masses. I emailed you. so let me know soon. as the fair is only 2 weeks away!
@_date: 2014-08-05 22:13:19
how u do that? 
@_date: 2014-02-03 06:22:18
I havent even run this thru by anyone else yet so there's still going to have to be some edits. I think its too long... I've been hosting the bitcoin meetups since 2012 and its alot of the good clips that i can find. maybe i'm cramming too much into it.
@_date: 2014-07-22 01:06:44
for those that don't know what the show is:  -- It's a pretty positive episode on crypto currency! Let's see how the masses take it... -- It's the guy from SUPER SIZE ME, you don't recognize him. --
@_date: 2017-02-13 14:43:37
what does that even mean.... 
@_date: 2014-09-16 16:30:42
This is sooo much better than Moleskins. and mokeskins aren't BTC friendly. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 17:50:06
you'll never get a decentralized fiat system. its **impossible** to digitally transfer fiat without the banking system involved. its just not possible. you can do it if you put cash in an envelope, but even that has its limits!
@_date: 2016-01-03 04:07:11
maybe he's the other anonymous dev building 2.0 tech.... I think only one other coin has that. I think he's called bcnext... 
@_date: 2015-01-06 17:47:29
its pretty crazy that multigateway hasn't gotten the marketing it deserves. it literally is the first decentralized exchange. alot of people bash NXT due to the premine factor, but if only users stopped looking at the coin and looked at the apps, it will change their view. Building the apps will attract users that won't care what coin its denominated in, people will come for the apps. Think of people that like to play Poker for example, they dont care what the chips are denominated in, because at the end of the day, they will cash out back to their main currency (usd or btc). People will come for the innovative features. NXT IS NOT GOING TO KILL BTC, if you are worried about that. But it might take out the less innovative coins out there thats for sure, ex clone coins with nothing new.
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:23:20
how does this work? got a demo?
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:28:30
How you different from bitsquare?
@_date: 2014-05-21 03:13:43
im surprised.. the nyc subreddit killed the post.. wow.. didnt know there were that many trolls there.
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:19:37
anyone know why? 
@_date: 2016-06-11 02:10:41
sorry but looks like a scam
@_date: 2016-06-10 22:47:11
what about libertyx.com?
@_date: 2017-01-27 14:38:20
how do you get used into the system?
@_date: 2017-01-19 00:53:07
screen shots? can't click on link. no docs
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:46:46
wouldn't this have the potential to destabilize a nations currency that has currency controls of some sort? seems like the first few steps of a digital currency war. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:27:07
how ? 
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:04:12
whats the average amount people buy? 
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:36:52
when was the last time u paid for stuff using those coins on ebay or any 2nd hand marketplace online? if i were to only accept those, i'd be out of business.
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:52:05
me too. it cant get infected by malware or trojans. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:40:54
then you might not understand and especially if you don't have a business that buys inventory every month.
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:54:35
go try to buy something on ebay... u cant. then have fun paying full price.
@_date: 2015-08-05 17:55:45
i just called them and they released it. and the rep tells me "sorry it was our mistake". WTF??? seriously... i cannot wait for that fucking day when btc takes over. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:45:00
it has its uses. it can't get hacked thats for sure.
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:37:58
i think they are going to sell paypal. their platform is shit. repeat piece of shit... they dont even update it. still looks like the same 10 years ago.
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:53:57
have fun paying near full price for stuff since u dont shop on ebay. and good luck with craigslist.
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:34:31
there is no choice. ebay is the largest 2nd hand market. and you cannot and i repeat cannot accept any other form of payment. just an fyi for you.
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:51:48
i'd be out of business. u can't just say bitcoin to every business. makes no sense. general public has no idea of how to use it or work with it. we still need to educate the masses and that doesnt seem to be happening fast enough.
@_date: 2015-08-11 13:26:01
you can buy it from here with bitcoin:  -- ships from nyc.
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:37:26
possibly so!
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:50:50
not an option. ebay doesnt take it. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:49:26
u dont run a business  with alot of inventory that why. once u hit the 5 figure transactions. you'll see wat i mean.
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:38:30
yea but u cant pay via anything else on ebay. and thats where majority of the business is!
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:07:52
i do alot of ebay business and guess what you CANNOT accept anything else besides paypal. there is nothing that rivals ebay's 2nd hand market.... good luck with openbazaar... its going to take a long while.
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:06:54
lol how so? 
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:37:16
there is no choice. ebay is the largest 2nd hand market. and you cannot and i repeat cannot accept any other form of payment. just an fyi for you.
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:41:52
no im actually glad they released my funds after a phone call. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:36:16
hopefully so!
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:53:04
regardless they still have to deal with kyc and aml. which is fine.
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:41:35
your stuck with paypal for the time being. they control a large chuck of the payment ecosystem.
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:43:23
never used them, but ebay doesnt accept that.
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:35:42
yea i've heard it many times from other business owners. we're at the wimps of these big boys.
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:52:19
it depends!
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:39:20
no.. i actually teach bitcoin classes and run the meetups here. google "xcubicle bitcoin"
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:44:24
you'd be out of business if you only accept bitcoin. regular folks have no idea of how it works and the price fluctuations aren't helping either. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:43:10
its going to take some time. hopefully my next project can help out on the adoption! ^^
@_date: 2015-08-15 18:02:17
do i have to download the entire 40gb+ blockchain on this too? 
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:35:14
i dont think so. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:46:45
its a smart legit scam. props to that.
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:35:02
i understand that. its just annoys the crap out of me.
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:42:18
same here.... i never leave my money in there.
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:50:32
ebay dont take stripe!
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:40:22
you can't punish this bad actor as they are in cahoots with ebay. you cannot pay with anything else on ebay except for paypal. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:49:07
10 year ebay seller. 2nd hand goods. either way my phone called helped and rep told me it was a "mistake". must be some other stupid reason with their flawed outdated system.
hopefully i can help speed up btc adoption with my next project. ^^
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:47:51
they control the 2nd hand market. what can you do!? nothing for the time being until someone comes up with something decentralized but that also poses a problem as its going to be hard to market it to general public. most people have no idea of how btc works.
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:06:40
in the USA! Boston area!
@_date: 2015-08-06 13:46:01
i understand the risk. i've been a seller on ebay for over 10 years and this just baffles me. which is why the phone call helped, but still why do i have to call in to fix a "mistake". wtf is wrong with their system. 
@_date: 2017-04-28 22:05:59
sounds like nxt
@_date: 2016-02-24 14:20:34
you might want to try out nxt. and just reskin there native wallet as it's already mobile friendly. then just tap into shapeshift for accepting other coins into nxt.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:32:11
wtf this is so confusing. where is the law that states this?
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:01:20
no i have the official 3.3.2 version from the official site. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 18:26:00
I tried switching to another server. Still gives the error. Was working fine before the Electrum ddos attack. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 02:27:06
why not piggy back on top of something that already works and just needs a nicer gui on top of it. nxt marketplace. no need to worry about users hosting the blockchain to store their goods. it just works. it can be integrated to take btc if your a purist. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 02:43:59

am i late? 
@_date: 2015-03-18 20:27:24
eventually one of the decentralized marketplaces will take hold to avoid this issue. seems that this one has been operational since sept-2014:

@_date: 2015-11-03 18:46:55
yyyyy now
@_date: 2015-03-03 16:56:15
whats this broken security model ? PoS? I looked up this:  
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:03:53
actually NXT had the first "fully working" crypto to crypto exchange via the multigateway. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:51:08
sidechains actually exists on the nxt platform. they call it monetary system. something to checkout... 
@_date: 2015-02-25 01:02:20
im curious to why its a scam coin? 
@_date: 2015-02-20 20:59:39
at that time there actually was no NFC enabled btc wallet. currently aegis also has sms sending of btc even if they dont have a btc wallet. the receiver just replies with their btc address. something even mycellium doesnt have. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:08:04
they still developing it.. but on another note.. seems like the nxt platform already has it: 
@_date: 2016-07-22 23:20:46
whats so good about bread wallet? hows it compare to mycellium?
