Zap a QR code and be done with it?  I think you might be over simplifying the accessibility of your bitcoin.  If it is that simple then it would be that simple to steal too, wouldn't it?   
Also, there are plenty of tools that you can use to auto-populate all the forms.  Yes, its a new tool, but so are QR codes.

Not true.  Recreational players want to wager on a sporting event to make it fun, they really don't want to have to worry about the volatility of the currency behind the wager. 
Professional players consider themselves experts in certain sports, they do not want to now have to double the effort into researching the fluctuations in bitcoin.

Not a merchant, not fluent in transactions of bitcoin, just the technology itself.  Having said that, is it expensive to become a bitcoin accepting merchant?  Are there monthly fees without any transactions coming in.  Basically, are the barriers to entry big or small, and is it worth it.  
it sounds as if the owner is in love with the idea and may be willing to pay for the capability, however, if barriers to entry were super low or non-existent (until a transaction occurs) this could really entice a lot of businesses to use it.  Heck, they'd really love it if their fees were less than CC fees.

How are you fucked?  If you are betting a specific unit size, whether its worth $100 or $10,000 shouldn't really affect it.  Also, if you are using a reasonable unit size for your bankroll it shouldn't really sway anything. I'd probably not mind losing 10btc as the rest of my bankroll has just gone up 100x.

Thats a really good idea I hadn't considered.
