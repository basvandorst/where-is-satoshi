Well yeah, but it was always the excuse of "eh, I'll do it later..." Unfortunately later was too late to be retired by 30 from Bitcoin.
But... It's not necessarily too late to retire at 40 from it ��

And I'm sitting here wishing I would have bought in on the ignore phase instead of procrastinating until a month ago.

Fuck that. I'm 31 and have shit for retirement savings. I've got plans on a business that will make me set for life, but it's not going to happen for 6 more years due to the nature of what I'm going to be selling. Already started the process of doing a 401k loan to start making big purchases of btc.
Fortune favors the bold. Buy big now and HODL. Worst case scenario? I lose out a little and have to put up with weekly repayment on my loan for a while.

If I leave early I will just have to set up an alternate repayment plan. For example, 20 bucks a week taken out of my bank account.
The business will sell essential items to consumers in a particular area at a specific time. Can't get more detailed than that, but basically already have supply locked and loaded. Just a matter of waiting for the right time to come.

Is it really a correction though? I'm thinking it's more fud based on the fact that we are currently unsure of what, if any, regulations they will try to impose on exchanges operated there.
