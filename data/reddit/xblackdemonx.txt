Then there is absolutly 0 competition with Coinbase since I can buy from Canada with Coinbase and not Robinhood.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:08:37
They should start by supporting users trying to login to their exchange...
@_date: 2019-07-17 18:45:31
I never said on live television. He gets his dick sucked probably every day.
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:48:28
We should since it's been going on for over 6 months now. 
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:07:15
That 87$ though
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:46:41
Looks like you were totally wrong.
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:31:28
But but but.... he already does that all the time!!!

Rich bastard!
@_date: 2014-12-12 19:20:06
Opalcoin LOL wtf is that?!

@_date: 2014-01-14 20:31:22

It's all about the tax over the other tax! 
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:59:54
Ya you are supposed to enter it in the comments when you checkout. I don't find this convenient so I will check this with Moolah to see if something can be done about it. But no worries for now we can contact people by email for their info
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:24:16
A Photo of the screen, really? You don't know how to take a screenshot in 2014?  
Btw good job on fixing BTC.
@_date: 2014-08-16 13:31:08
Yes exactly! 
@_date: 2014-10-01 17:17:29
Indeed. I've been with VOS since they opened and I never had a problem.
@_date: 2014-04-28 21:52:27
A lot cheaper than in Montreal where we pay 1.50$ per litre
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:37:46
Super! :)
@_date: 2014-10-27 16:55:21
How can I subscribe to this "spam" ?
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:24:13
MTGox needs to die and quick. It's dragging the BTC price down
@_date: 2014-08-16 01:35:12
Ya,  check the reputation first... 
@_date: 2014-07-12 18:37:28
Even with all the machines that are mining Bitcoins? 
@_date: 2015-01-28 10:44:15
@_date: 2015-01-21 19:44:50
1000$ per month for mobile games? Nobody does that unless you like "free2play" games
@_date: 2015-01-21 17:22:13
I can save up to 100% by using [Google Reward Opinion]( app lol
@_date: 2015-01-20 19:40:11
I will need to wait for 100 confirmations before the page loads?
@_date: 2016-01-27 13:47:20

Ah ok so you are telling us you steal from your workplace. Good job.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:27:51
You only have to give her the ฿
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:11:13
There is no point in mining with a CPU. You'll burn the CPU before you make 0.01$ worth of BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:48:40
I remember this like if it was 7 months ago...
@_date: 2017-01-06 11:24:20
900 :(
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:32:48

The way the sentence is written.

10 000$ mode ACTIVATED!
@_date: 2016-11-11 19:20:16
You guys really listen to this drug addict?
@_date: 2018-06-03 18:09:51
Next time, sell the BTC on an exchange... 
@_date: 2016-11-11 19:19:49
You guys really listen to this drug addict?
@_date: 2016-11-12 15:11:35
No drugs here. I am pure like a Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 21:11:21
BCH needs to fall. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:10:53
It's sad but true.
@_date: 2019-08-28 11:31:06
@_date: 2018-06-21 00:56:41
BCH has to burn to the ground 
@_date: 2016-11-02 04:52:50
You don't 
@_date: 2018-06-08 05:22:32
That's the dream! 
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:18:35
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:34:10
Except it's been crashing for over 6 months now.
@_date: 2019-02-27 23:03:48
@_date: 2019-06-19 20:51:56
Isn't there a way for us to take down that website?
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:17:23
Well, the told everyone that they were closing (i think) 3-4 months before. If you don't check your stuff then I guess it's your fault.
@_date: 2019-12-20 20:51:09
BTC YES! Vegan NO!
@_date: 2015-08-20 17:37:21
With what money?
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:35:23
He bought high and sold low.
@_date: 2019-12-02 16:20:56
I prefer to see him eat his own dick.
@_date: 2015-07-15 15:32:08
Did you try to withdraw before the time limit? The announced it months before that if you didn't withdraw before the limit they would keep it.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:47:00
$6,799.76  
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:40:54
@_date: 2019-04-09 16:46:01
I received this exact message. BLOCK/DELETE!
@_date: 2019-04-02 19:59:50
If it's stupid but it works, then it ain't stupid.
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:24:22
I cannot wait for the Begita memes: Over 4000!!!!
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:51:18
Because they want to increase the price of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-03 21:45:14
Is it me or this is wrong? In the busiest obituary season it says BTC ATH was in december 2018.
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:16:09
*slow clap*
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:54:47
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:00:07
IT'S OVER 9000!!!
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:48:31
Crypto gambling coming to mobile games confirmed?
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:18:11
It's not as bad if you look at the Zimbabwe price.
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:23:23
Monero is a shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-24 22:36:49
I have none and never will get any. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:22:58
What about BTC/LTC? 
@_date: 2018-07-24 22:35:40
If you think so. I've never heard of a good business using that shitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:32:44
Except that I got banned for life.
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:01:00
It has no use. It is not widely spread. No business uses it. No one wants it.
@_date: 2018-07-25 00:01:46
@_date: 2015-09-09 23:15:11
And we hate John McAfee
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:28:41
I agree Libra is a shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:26:57
I got banned for the same reason.
@_date: 2018-07-24 22:36:22
Then it's definitely a shitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:34:32
@_date: 2015-11-05 16:09:19
And now it's back down again.
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:55:16
1 answer: Because it was the first and only one.
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:17:24
That is exactly it! 
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:32:13
Don't you have fees everytime you buy?
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:55:47
What is the name of this board? Thanks


@_date: 2017-07-18 15:15:01
[The Man in question](
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:50:05
Isn't it better to buy a big chunk at a time instead of multiple smaller chunks?
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:28:12
Seems legit! 
@_date: 2016-07-04 18:24:29
I'll try. Thank you very much. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:22:05
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:35:17

@_date: 2019-05-14 15:53:41
Thank you!!! I cannot wait to see it LIVE!
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:55:05
What is the deadline for the dick eating again?
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:43:11
People search for Iran ?
@_date: 2019-05-03 22:06:45
@_date: 2013-05-25 13:37:39
Because i live in the only place in the world where they tax the tax... Québec,  Canada
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:50:01
I cannot wait to get my 5GH/s Jalapeno in 3 months! Thank you BFL!
@_date: 2013-05-10 13:59:37
I was really hesitant at first but after reading what people said about it and after seing some reviews I just had to try it. At the current value of bitcoins you can get up to 33$ per day! at this rate the machine would be paid in 10 days, after that, profit!!!
also look at this video: 
@_date: 2013-10-23 18:24:03
You are ready to mine 0.000001 BTC per day? 
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:44:56
Lars Ulrich will be thrilled!!!
@_date: 2013-06-05 03:48:49
Rofl I can get about 20 Jalapenos for 2$ at the grocery store
@_date: 2013-09-11 01:57:59
Thank you for posting this. I also want a refund as i paid enough interest on my credit card already 
@_date: 2013-09-06 20:06:10
Ok because now Paypal doesn't want to refund me because it's been over 45 days and BFL says since we started shipping we are not refunding anyone anymore... 
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:25:16
It's the story of a local merchant that says that he makes 70% of his profit from selling his shoes on the Internet and that he started to accept Bitcoin... 
They alsi try to explain it a bit to people that don't know what it is. 
Full story(French) : 
@_date: 2013-08-04 04:27:45
Please cancel your orders so I can get mine quicker!
@_date: 2013-05-10 03:50:13
I am taking a chance with you buddy. I just ordered the 5GH/S BFL asic miner. My wife is gonna be pissed...
@_date: 2013-10-05 23:50:09
Total waste of electricity 
@_date: 2013-09-06 18:40:05
How long did it take to get an answer from the day you sent them an email ?
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:02:50
You should have known better...
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:28:33
Cute but GPU mining is useless now
@_date: 2013-09-25 20:21:20
I cannot wait to get my refund from BFL! I mean my chargeback from my credit card company. Fuck You BFL! 
@_date: 2013-06-09 06:40:03
This is what you want to be looking at
"We finished the week with July 2012 Jalapenos mostly shipped"
@_date: 2013-05-18 20:03:13
I bought one as well about 2 weeks ago and it says it should arrive by the end of July (i wish) and i'm gonna set it up at work so it's gonna cost no electricity for me muahaha
