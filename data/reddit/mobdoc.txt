They are similar. BCH was born as a new fork of the original BTC chain. The BCH camp wanted to keep bitcoin from upgrading. This ensured all transactions remain on chain and that the only way to scale is to increase block sizes. As miners get money from transaction fees you can imagine why all the big miner groups liked bitcoin the way it was. The legacy BTC chain upgraded a few features to start to pave the way for off chain scaling solutions. This will allow users to spend bitcoin instantly with lower fees but ultimately pegged to the main chain. As miners get less transactions on the main chain to process, they get less fees, so they didn’t like bitcoin. They forked, and set up BCash which is about 10-20% of BTC value. 
You can tell what the market wanted.

I'm having trouble understanding this. Correct me if I'm wrong but this does not prevent he duplication of the EXACT same digital copy. So the authentic copy of this art can go anywhere. 
What it does is create an elite club who can prove they bought it from the artist/dealer. This club is limited but members can come and go by selling their membership. 
If that is true I think it misses the point of owning something scarce. A museum can still show the original piece, and I can have the original piece on my desktop. The member's only club will have no influence over the price of this artwork as it misses the point. It just creates a club approved by the artist. Maybe there's some value in that club but it's not the scarcity of the artwork.

The retarded thing that these SupplyChain blockchain solutions don’t get is that the blockchain says sweet fuck all about physical goods. 
Unless they are uniquely identifiable (not the packaging, but the actual product) then Blockchain is doing nothing. 
For this to work, the crab (in their example) would have to be DNA profiled, and both verifiable going in, and at the consumer’s end of the supply chain. 
Instead they are proposing packaging QR codes and RFIDs. Swap the contents and no one has any idea that their blockchain system failed.

Buying pressure from more mainstream users - I agree. I can't see it happening until the average person can do it easily and securely. So far most people have insecure online presence, freak out at 2FA and no idea how to store bitcoin. We may not like it but until banks, Google, PayPal, Amazon and Apple support bitcoin for their users we will likely not see this buying pressure.

They have a closed blockchain system to help settle between trusted banks. Essentially SWIFT 2.0. They are missing the point of open, trust-less, distributed and free distributed ledger. Blockchain tech's entire point is to allow value to be traded between parties that don't need to trust each other. They are trying to keep this "must trust the others" network, and must control the network. 
When they figure out the open bitcoin ledger does this for free, and better at it, they will come around. It's fun to watch the light bulb slowly turn on for each of these banks. 
The analogy is the Internet. They went crazy with the idea of closed systems like aol, compuserve, etc. But then we know what happened.

"To see mainstream adoption"? 
My grandmother and mother don't give two shits about block size. I think you mean to support mainstream adoption. 
For mainstream adoption people have to trust their online security. For that they need to have their emails and online presence secured like their banks. And right now they don't know how to do that. 2FA is easy for us to fathom but not those considered in the mainstream.

How does it track the whereabouts? You mean who owns it?
Also, it doesn't seem right saying it's an authentic edition. The file or work-of-art is 100% digital and a copy of it is no different. Is it more accurate saying authentic owners?
And by "membership" I was using it as an analogy as in this system it is only a token that is scarce and traded. That token may represent a file, but it is not the file. 
I have another question: if I already have a copy of the digital work-of-art on my computer, and then I buy the token of authenticity from someone that already owns it. Can I use my original copy of said artwork with my token? If so then my point still stands - this does nothing for authenticating original artwork, but rather original buyers. Like a club, hence memberships that are capped and can be traded. 
If I am wrong and you can verify a digital copy as authentic over a different 100% digital copy owned by average joe then I will be stoked, but it doesn't appear to be so by my understanding.

Jokes aside I would advise against buying bitcoin for the purpose of making money. I first bought bitcoin for a small amount of money and learned everything I could about using it and securely storing it. Once I learned more about it I saw value that was beyond the price. Yes it will be nice when and if it goes back up, but the real value will be what it offers to many people from many different backgrounds, and at any location in the world. If you want to buy, treat it like any investment; buy only what you can afford to loose.

I, and most people, accept some degree of risk for increased functionality. Each to their own. But you can't warn people away from other suitable options because they differ from your philosophy. Instead, we should tell people the risks and benefits of all iOS options.

I don't think I've seen it listed here but remittance, I feel, will be a huge tipping point for Bitcoin. Already with mPesa, once expats realise the efficiency and ease of sending significant savings instantly to family members in African countries, India, Philippines, Mexico etc etc and with negligible fees, it will explode. 
Then seeing the value increase with this wider adoption and awareness I can see an economic surge for these regions.

How many times is this drum going to be beat. It was speculation at most and FUD from people like you. There are major businesses investing in coinjar. I see your concerns. Been using them for almost 6 months and it's been a breeze. No one should store their funds on any exchange while not transacting, but this site works fine for buying and selling coin.

The bitcoin network adjusts the difficulty of solving the next block based on the hash power of the network. If more inexpensive and faster mining hardware is added to the network it may solve a few blocks faster initially but the network will adjust the difficulty so that this is evened out. Not an issue.
I hope I understood your question.

And they could charge a fee still cheaper than our alternative. Basically, someone should capitalise on the Bitcoin protocol for money transfer that does not require the receiving party to use Bitcoin. But this would introduce Bitcoin to them knowing it was used, and used quickly.

Yes. These are called "whales". You occasionally see them doing this but their effect on the market has been steadily decreasing. Also, they risk more value when they gamble it like this, as the value of the BTC goes up. If they play the market at the wrong time it could be incredibly costly. For this reason we will see less attempts and less effects as the value of Bitcoin continue to rise. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 20:01:54
There is a wide range of wallets that offer different benefits and risks for their different intended purposes. This one allows you to spend easily, and restore form back up. For spending purposes, that is great. But we all understand the risks. There is no perfect wallet, but this does not mean "nothing to see here".

I understand that. Open source would be great. But I was responding to the statement that Pheeva is not Open Source. So I said that there are no other options for Bitcoin iOS wallets (even open source), this is it. And even if it was open source you should not trust it beyond it's intended purpose - Spending small amounts, not storing your stash. 
I paid for groceries yesterday using it and it was gloriously easy. That's all I want. 
Let's contact the developers and let them answer some questions to put people's mind at ease; but to be honest I don't think anything will....
Hot wallets = increased risk

Not quite. A large part of the delay is waiting for my bank to send it out (like next business day which can be as long as 60 hours from Friday evening). And internationally it takes a lot. This would speed up the send out process, effectively making the only delay the deposit aspect.

It also challenges what they think is a working monetary and payment system already. They may know there are flaws, but stick they're head in the ground and discussing Bitcoin forces them to think about it.

The only problem is how quick you can get to the Bitcoin wallet, sign in or put your pin code in, choose scan qr code and then scan. By this point you're already 200m down the road. 
If homeless vet had a Bitcoin QR code and the message saying "take a photo, send me coins later", then people can much more easily whip out photo app (accessible from locked screen) and snap a quick photo.  He could also have a message saying "ask me about Bitcoin" for added awareness. 
ScanLife app allows you to scan any QR code or bar codes real time..... Or from a saved photo. They can see the benefit from scanning from a photo.... Surely there is a need for it in a Bitcoin wallet. I think I've highlighted just one.

Hey question.  Which Bitcoin wallet app (iPhone) allows you to scan a QR code from a saved photo? Pheeva, blockchain and coinbase don't allow me to. 
I know this QR code is not working but for future cases. If I see a busker accepting Bitcoin I want to take a photo and keep going. And maybe send coins later.

Lamar, I have Pheeva. This is besides the point. My brother was only showing me my friend's set up. I'm deciding later to send coins. 
It is so quick to pull up a camera app (you can do it from a lock screen in iPhone) take photo and decide to send later. Maybe you don't know how much you want to send at that moment - save for later. 
But so much slower with Bitcoin wallets. Want to quickly capture a qr code (as you drive by)? - BTC wallet steps: unlock screen with pin, swipe to find BTC apps, choose wallet, enter pin, go to send coin section, but scan button, focus on qr code. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 18:39:55
There is no good reason to trust any online service - so your reasoning goes for any hot wallet. But this group has a wallet that works well, backs up so when you loose your phone, you can begin using it on the new phone. 
Stop all this hatred to what is a good thing. 
Don't put your life savings on it - no one, including pheeva say this is a good idea. 
But if you want a smart phone wallet that works well, and handles your small spending funds then this is it!

This is great for cash like purchases. I usually hold ~0.3BTC in it and spend it at any brick and mortar BTC accepting venue. Supposedly the private keys are created and stored on the device. If you loose your iphone and password BTC on it will be gone. Like any hot wallet I wouldn't store anything more than that. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 19:18:30

If miners begin to hold, does this not counter balance the price drop at a certain point? Currently ~$1.6M mined every day. And if cashed out, the same amount must be coming in to keep the price the same. If miners don't cash out, scarcity and money coming in should bring price back up. 
Collectively it may work like this. But I know nothing about all this stuff.

Sure I had a look at your history. Answer if you feel inclined - I'm sure you've debated this already so no offense if you ignore it.
*With my paypal app I can receive funds from anyone else using paypal. I can also pay anyone else with Paypal. Paypal doesn't hold the money on that app, but it links with my Paypal account.*
**Same sentence, but replaced with Coinbase app, and funds with BTC.**
*With my Coinbase app I can receive BTC from anyone else using Coinbase/BTC wallet. I can also send BTC to anyone else with Coinbase app. Coinbase doesn't hold the money on that app, but it links with my Coinbase account.*
I'm sure Paypal paid a lot of money to get their app on iOS, and I'm sure , as you said, Apple don't want to open up their security to scrutiny of hackers with bitcoin incentive. And apple see this as a threat to their payment. That all makes sense, but differences with paypal are not clear to me based on these arguments.

That is the reality on iOS. If you want fully functional Pheeza, if youwant partial functional appstore Bitwallet. I have no problem leaving a bit of BTC on Coinbase, Kracken, and Pheeva. Sure, there is a risk, but I'm prepared for that to get full functionality.

Trying to understand how this works. If someone knows more please explain.
PayByCoin is an Inuit online wallet that holds your business private keys and therefore your bitcoin? 
If so can you withdraw the bitcoin to your own storage system? 
Will inuit quick books monitor external addresses? Can you by-pass PayByCoin entirely and have payments settled directly to your privately managed bitcoin wallet?
Ideally I want to hold my business bitcoins. I want to be able to send invoices to each contact (with their own bitcoin address to pay to). I want my financial management software to monitor these addresses without touching my bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 16:51:52


Bitpay, Coinbase, any other exchange. Are you fucking kidding me?


Don't give me a lecture about third party payment processing and then tell me I shouldn't have got into bitcoin in the first place. People use bitcoin for many different reasons and many don't care if transactions connect to our name. Many are simply are looking for a better system.
Get off your high horse and bring constructive discussion to this ongoing topic and realise there are many people that think different form you and each to their own. I want ease of spending like my fucking wallet in my pocket with notes. If I loose my wallet I don't blame the entire system and start to rethink my financial decisions, it's a wallet. More mobility at increased risk. How is that hard to understand? You do it every day.

The system I have right now is perfect for my UK business. It's a UK accountancy bookkeeping program that tracks everything and helps invoicing, expenditures, salaries, with my UK taxes. The majority of my business will stay as fiat for the foreseeable future. But I want to begin accepting bitcoin from clients that want to (likely offer discount). I want to invoice them the same way and track as it were any other currency. I want my freeagent to monitor these paid invoices as it does with paypal. I want it to monitor my btc funds as it does with my bank accounts. I would still like to have total control over my Bitcoin wallets (Quickbooks option does not offer this)
Have a look at freeagent website and you will see what I mean. Just want to add Bitcoin to the well integrated stream.  
As for the Bitcoin I receive I will likely keep most of it as bitcoin.

Speed is not an issue. All POS that accept bitcoin do not wait for confirmations so it is instant. The risk of it being unconfirmed is not significant with typical POS transaction amounts. It would be different if it were for the purchase of a Lamborghini or something extravagant - a few network confirmations to be sure. 
Paypal - yes. I realise paypal is practically instant too. But 5% fee to merchant (or is it 2.5%)? And still the risk of charge back. 
My payment had a 0.000whatever transaction fee and it was done. 
I think it's more impressive than PayPal but people will likely not need to understand difference if/when PayPal starts using it.

I should clarify that I meant when using Bitcoin it forces honesty.
Clarifying that if you wanted to commit criminal activities involving any value using bitcoin (steal, defraud, blackmail, fund morally corrupt 3rd parties, etc) you would learn that Bitcoin is not going to help. It makes each step transparent and and when a physical exchange out of the bitcoin system occurs, the person can be caught. 
The same goes for government, corporations, charities. Using it forces honesty, accountability, transparency. 
I like that for both sides.

Think of Coinbase as a bank. When a bank transfers from account to account guess what? They include your name. Or the business's name.

If anyone wants privacy with their transactions stop asking the guy that controls your bitcoin to keep your privacy.

Everything I've read about Coinbase monitoring where BTC goes involves transactions like Coinbase-&gt;Localbitcoins, Coinbase-&gt;Darknetmarkets or Coinbase-&gt;Marijuana Dispensary (If I recall correctly). 
Anyways, what the complaining individuals have all forgotten is that even though they purchased the BTC, if it stays on Coinbase it is in Coinbase's possession. Coinbase hold the private keys, probably announcing those private keys to overseeing government agencies to ensure transparent and legal business practices. If they are seen sending BTC to LBC,DNM,WeedVendors it could be seen as dealing in illicit activities.  
I am yet to hear about users being flagged on Coinbase for sending their own BTC (user controlled private keys) to one of the aforementioned controversial destinations.  We need proof of this if it happens but for now all the idiots sending their Coinbase controlled BTC to questionable destinations should grow some sense.

Are there ways around disconnections. If there is a player with an active seat and active hand, their address could bring them back to the table quickly? After proving they own the address by signing a transaction?
And within the countdown before they forfeit the hand?

You're talking about inflation, I'm talking about value and the swings/volatility making it lose confidence in those looking to invest or use it as a storage of value.
That is exactly what a Fixed Exchange rate aims to do (
"A fixed exchange rate, sometimes called a pegged exchange rate, is a type of exchange rate regime where a currency's value is fixed against either the value of another single currency, to a basket of other currencies, or to another measure of value, such as gold. There are benefits and risks to using a fixed exchange rate. A fixed exchange rate is usually used in order to stabilize the value of a currency by directly fixing its value in a predetermined ratio to a different, more stable or more internationally prevalent currency (or currencies), to which the value is pegged. In doing so, the exchange rate between the currency and its peg does not change based on market conditions, the way floating currencies will do. This makes trade and investments between the two currency areas easier and more predictable, and is especially useful for small economies in which external trade forms a large part of their GDP."

I think when your understanding of bitcoin grows past the idea of people holding virtual coins then you will understand how hacking, in the way you propose, is impossible. Firstly, you must realise that no one has, in their possession, the actual bitcoins. They merely have the password to claim they own some. The bitcoins are all in the open for everyone to see. So some guy over there can't just "print more" because everyone can see where they are coming from and how they are not part of the bitcoin pool. This is distributed consensus. New coins can't just sneak into the pool. 
Hacking would have to happen on the user side. Like someone hacks a database that stores everyone's password. This is how big exchanges got hacked in the past and all the bitcoins could be seen being passed to a new Bitcoin address.

Rosie, here are my honest thoughts. More transparency from Coinbase would be good. Publish stats or summaries (anonymous) highlighting common reasons for locked accounts or cancelled orders. If there are users obviously acting against Coinbase rules then this would be easily announced to the Coinbase group.

Not a dumb question. I would havea good read through the stickied post for new comers. it explains storage in great detail. 
You are about to be fully responsible for your bitcoin so a good read into paper wallets, hardware wallets, master keys and backups is needed. A couple of BTC on breadwallet is not terrible, but I tend to think about it like a physical wallet. I'm happy storing about $50-$100 in my wallet but never much more in case I get mugged. Same goes iwth bitcoin. Enough to spend on day to day, but otherwise it;s too much for a mobile smartphone BTC wallet. For my large amount of cash and savings I need a more secure, less accessible mode of storage. Same again for Bitcoin.

There will be some daily and weekly limits but independent reserve and btcmarkets are good. You can use POLpay with most Australian banks, or BPay. I used to use CoinJar but found their fees/rates weren't comparable to independent reserve.

@_date: 2019-02-23 13:54:16
Central Banks are not government. 
The government issues bonds that central bank can buy, injecting cash into the economy. This has with it interest owed to the central bank. 
All money is created as debt with interest.
Bitcoin in fundamentally different and distrupts the conventional relationship of government monetary policy and central banks. 
That relationship won’t be disrupted without oodles of resistance. 
If, for some reason of survival, central banks thought wisely to store bitcoin they would have to purchase it. E.g. from the us government.
But likely they will try to develop their own cryptocurrency (private) claiming it has the benefits of other distributed ledgers.

For fuck sake. Just move your coins to a personal wallet. A wallet in your sole control.  Then do what you want with them. 
The fact that people still move bitcoin directly from their coinbase controlled wallets to addresses associated with dark markets or gambling sites makes me wonder how stupid these people are. 
Treat Coinbase as a bank. Done. Move on
It is the same as wiring money from your chase bank account to your drug dealer. 
This is a non-issue if everyone just used their fucking heads we could stop bringing this up!!!!!!!!

I'm sorry. I love bitcoin but this is absurd. TV doesn't work by putting a significantly unknown (but brilliant) bitcoin voice telling people about a technology that is still in the extremely early days. It would be the same as walking up to a group of people and trying to talk about bitcoin.

It's not listed here but if people keep losing large chunks of BTC to hackers or fraud then there will be a huge loss of confidence.

The more I try to emphasize the volatility, "better read up on it first", the "invest only what you can afford to lose", and the whole "maybe it's not the best thing to rush into"...... the more they come at me for helping. 
I had more luck keeping them skeptical and careful when I used to say flat out.... you should buy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-02 18:04:52
This has already happened. Check out hashing rates over the years and you'll see it shoot down as miners literally turn their rigs off. And you see it shoot up when miners turn loads on. Usually reflecting cost of mining versus btc price. Anyways. This happens but it would take a concerted effort for all miners around the world to turn the rig off at the same time, immediately after a block is solved. But there would always be some that would say "you know what, I may keep my huge mining operation going to snag this easy reward". 
So. What you are saying is so improbable that it is not worth worrying about. The network would correct itself. Like it has done hundreds of times. 
I suggest looking into hashing rate, difficulty etc in more detail as I am not explaining it to you well enough.

Umm...... Is this sarcasm? 
You know the blocks stay at 10mins regardless of miners and hashing power, right? They could leave on all but a few USB asic miners and it would still be at 10 min per block.

Perhaps a stupid question but as these become more scarce will the FACTOM system eventually be closed? I notice the nodes and auditors will get paid in factoids so perhaps this is how the system stays active? I'm guessing its like pre-release of an altcoin before the miners resume.
@_date: 2015-11-11 23:25:47

Blockchain - trustless distributed ledger. 
I'd love to see how the Banks will attempt a distributed ledger without distributing it to anyone. It's like they see "trustless" and think it is only of value to the institutions and not the users.

Will do. Thanks!

She dove into the scaling debate and the fundamentals of SW and MW for on and off-chain transactions. She touched briefly on LN but it got too technical for me. She finished with ETH and how she loves the subtle difference between IPFS and SWARM. A good watch actually. You should probably just subscribe and thank me later.

Isn't each subreddit, and the collective majority of Reddit, a big circlejerk?
@_date: 2018-04-29 10:42:45
Do more reading first. Much more reading. If you don’t know the history or bitcoin and those particular forks then you are not ready. You need to learn about the differences of each. 
Then make sure you understand 2FA for all of your online presences. 
Then learn about effective storage for your bitcoin. 
But above all, read about why each fork exists, and what support is behind it. 
Also, this r/bitcoin subreddit primarily supports bitcoin (core). The r/BTC supports bitcoin cash. Ask the same question there for impartiality. 
Good luck. 
And go read more about it.

Take a stand or not is up to you. Regardless of what you believe, you can be active in your support for this global experiment.

From a saved photo too!!!!!
Driving past a QR code (Charity sign, Homeless man) snap a photo and then sed coins later! Its hard but not many wallets have this feature to load QR code from a saved photo.
@_date: 2015-10-18 05:43:28
Just tried it and got 15%!
@_date: 2015-10-23 23:31:45
Nah. It was the US marshals and DOJ
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:58:50
Wait? I'm not trying to spam. How can I effectively notarise a document. Is there a better way. Sorry if I'm spamming network. It's only for one document. 
@_date: 2015-10-18 03:15:24
Brilliant. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 02:54:10
That will be up to their terminal provider. If it's debit card hopefully it's minimal like bank debit cards. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 15:48:44
Or is it showing the first Hard Fork?
@_date: 2019-05-23 04:09:03
Use your drivers license.
@_date: 2019-05-20 09:07:44
Yes. Every dollar created was done so with interest. 
Natural resources may be value created but the monetary policies around the world all have money created through a debt mechanism.
@_date: 2015-02-23 13:53:32
I think the blockchain.info merchant section may allow this. Or bitpay. Use Bitpay and you could keep whatever amount of purchases as bitcoin sent to an address you control. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 08:46:04
Mine too.
@_date: 2018-12-03 04:57:19
Our coordinated efforts would be akin to whales. Buying pools. To fight off the whales. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 06:26:00
Or trezor. Or keepkey. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 02:35:22
Turns out I wasn’t the only one awake!
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:13:47
Thanks Franklyn. I'm also not sure how it would work. I thought maybe an AMA style with presubmitted questions on both r/BTC and r/bitcoin. 
Then hosted on an impartial subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:28:29
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:00:32
Hey, This is really helpful. But I don't understand the link well enough to add AUD as well? Can you tell me how to add more like this?
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:59:23
Honey.... So hot right now.
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:11:38
Wow, I'm actually waiting for a seller to release the BTC I bought today. I thought this was about me initially but I'm all verified. 
This is why I prefer cash transfer in person. Less worry for either person doing it in person. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:31:42
Yes. Chill Jericho. Chill. 
If the chain splits (unlikley) you'll have coins on both. That's when you hold tight again until a dominant chain wins and your coins are right where you always left them. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:47:54
Any chance you could add a USD/LTC from a website (not sure what website to use)? I will then try to add the LTC/AUD link after I see your example.
Edit: Like from 
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:40:24
Spot on OP. I'm a fan of BTC but all these posts of similar fanatics giving these as solo gifts are no different to the priest writing a blessing instead if leaving the waitress an actual tip. I cringed a bit and looked forward to the fallout. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:17:32
Nah, my old man has bought some BTC but prefers to invest in gold and stocks. Worries about how the US will handle bitcoin. 
He thinks I'm dreaming
@_date: 2013-11-27 11:18:53
I BTC or 1 gold ounce. Depending on who wins. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:24:46
And wait for the reply too
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:27:33
Awesome. Thanks! I'll get back to you if he has more questions. Do you have experience setting up with bitpay? Do they help one to one, or is it simple enough without assistance?
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:47:31
Do you think this will usher in the need for multiple crypto currencies? That all work in a similar fashion keeping infrastructure the same? 
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:49:18
I'm assuming he supplied you with an address to send the bitcoin to. You can prove the bitcoin was sent to the address by going to blockchain.info, right?
@_date: 2013-12-31 07:26:32
For sure. But Coinbase peeps regularly respond to r/coinbase messages.  
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:55:51
All hatred aside the financial world relies on the USD as a "stable" currency. If the US respond unfavourably to bitcoin (i.e. Ban it's use) in order to preserve the USD prestige then this will affect bitcoin adoption to some way. I think that approach would only hurt the US in the long run but it is a legitimate concern right now. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 12:44:07
Wow. Thanks for your smart ass comment, very helpful. 
The exposure the markets get I would contest would be higher than most social platforms actively using and showcasing Bitcoin, and towards a broader variety of people (not just redditors or the tech savy)
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:09:55
Hey u/bjournfeuer, 
Would you mind adding annotations to your paper wallets to explain the features for this bitcoin newb? Or point me in the direction that explains paper wallets.
A paper wallet is one thing left that I don't quite grasp. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:40:25
Hey C121, 
If the date of the last bitcoin to be mined is supposedly predetermined to be around the year 2140, and if all mining was done by hand, I assume that the difficulty would be reduced significantly to make this achievable, no?
@_date: 2013-12-25 12:22:55
Coinbase too?
@_date: 2013-12-29 04:14:39
hmmm... This is what I found
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:27:00
This is great. I'll pass it on. He's not a redditor but I told him to look at this page and I can help him connect to any replies. I'm excited for him. 
But worried he knows my username. Damn. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:47:10
Thanks for posting! This is hilarious and I hope dogecoin does well and continues to introduce more people, especially the young, into cryptocurrencies. I was worried how the masses would get into BTC and I think this is it. I miss the humor of r/bitcoin but a line had to be drawn eventually as the user base was growing fast. 
I think a multi-coin world will exist, and the current rank is likely solidified, but whatever our predictions are, I know for sure that the the next decade is going to be exciting!!!
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:53:46
I was under the impression litecoin was very similar and had some additional features to bitcoin. What are its limitations for you to put it in the dumb clone category?
@_date: 2013-12-31 05:59:05
post to r/coinbase
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:27:21
Good point. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:19:45
How do they find people or groups willing to disclose their large pile for private sale?
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:26:31
Awesome. Worked perfectly. Thanks
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:51:22
"Stops the bigwigs from taking over control"
Everyone keeps saying this but how could they have controlled or regulated it anyways? Isn't the point of bitcoin that they can't? What alternative have china just avoided?
If they accepted it like a currency instead of a commodity how would it be potentially worse?
@_date: 2013-12-29 12:40:07
Yeah, of course. But painting and other big items can go up to a few thousand dollars. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:03:31
My bad
