In the last crash, correct me if I'm wrong, but it hit a high of 260 and then went to about 85.  The correction was 85/260 = 0.32x
In this crash it hit a high of 1163, and then went to about 382.  The correction was about 382/1163 = 0.32x
It's amazing to me how similar the pattern was.
Also, we hit this low point already, so one could argue that we're actually closer to that next cyclical bubble.

The longer you wait for a transaction, the less probability that it will be double spent.  Businesses like to wait 6 confirmations, but for day to day small transactions, this is overkill.  Bitpay doesn't even wait for 1 and they eat the cost of double spending on behalf of the businesses.  There's nothing wrong with the protocol, but rather that businesses are simply requiring an unnecessary amount of trust.
General rule of thumb:  More expensive transaction should require more confirmations.  Less expensive transaction should require less confirmations.
To those who say to use an altcoin with a shorter blocktime, that doesn't actually work.  While this does allow for a smaller granularity of "trust" that there's no double spending, it does not actually have any security difference.
Assuming an equal amount of network hash power, waiting for 1 10 minute confirmation is identical to waiting 10 1 minute confirmations.

Interesting, I've never seen that email before.  My guess is that they may do so to deter you from doing business with that person.
Since someone could always submit a transaction with a low fee, it wouldn't be reasonable to always pay the business in that case.  I assume that BitPay allows an instant payment if a reasonable fee is provided (since they know the network is most likely going to accept it eventually) and requires waiting for those with low fees.
I think you're right.  After thinking about it more, it would be trivial to abuse by just sending low fee payments, accepting the goods, and walking away.  However this isn't double spending like you mentioned.  I think I remember reading somewhere that they've never had a double spent transaction issue yet.

I'm not sure to be honest. Sadly, I gave up using them a while ago.  :(
If you can find a way to do it fast, I wish you luck. This is probably one of the easiest arbitrage profits ever.
Just be careful if you try it since you can't get USD out of course in case you change your mind half way through.

The price on mtgox is currently $285.
The price on bitstamp is currently $655.
285/655 = 0.43
If the people selling their goxbtc were smart, they can actually sell it for less and STILL arbitrage right now!  The true market value should be closer to 0.43, not 0.5.
That being said, it's still crazy how little the goxbucks are actually worth when there's so much uncertainty in the air!

Historically, I don't think it's actually that consistent.  It was probably just coincidental these last two times.  So 0.32x was the last two major corrections, but for the correction before that:
The high was 31.91 and the crash hit a low of 1.994.  The correction here was 1.994 / 31.91 = 0.06x.
This one was MUCH more drastic.  I really wish there was some easy to find pattern, but that's markets for ya - it's only there in hindsight.
The corrections of the last 3 biggest crashes from earliest to most recent:
So are the crashes becoming less drastic over time?  I believe that the volatility between crashes might be dying down (however I have absolutely no hard numerical proof of this, it's merely a guess).
What does all of this mean?  I have no idea.  Objective analysis is fun.

Questions to help figure out the issue:
1) Did you have an account before their password database was leaked?  If you recall, their hashed passwords were leaked into the public.
2) Did you ever change your password after the leak?
3) Do you use 2FA?
Hopefully the answers will help both you and the community figure out what the issue is.

Also, based on the last bubble/correction/whatever you want to call it, I notice that the peak was about the same magnitude increase in value.
The first went from about 12 to 260.
This past one went from 100 to 1160.
My numbers are probably off, but it seems like this past increase wasn't as drastic.  Perhaps with each successive influx of new users there are less and less volatility until eventually we level off and become stable.

Shut up, i'm not mean!
Just kidding.  I'm sorry to see you go :(
Please reconsider.  I think most people are just on edge due to the issues at MtGox.  The community niceness here tends to have a high correlation to the BTC price.

I can confirm what he said.  I tried to withdraw and have the same issue.  It appears that they are allowing a small number of people to withdraw only in order to give the appearance that they fixed the issue.  :(
Out of 8 friends who are using bitstamp, only one is able to withdraw and it took her sending 5 emails to them this morning.  They're withdrawing manually it appears.  Maybe they screwed up their withdrawal system with this fix.

I know, I know.  Sorry, I was just annoyed at the situation and was being a bit facetious.  I imagine in the future that credit will be given to anonymous people using BTC over a web of trust.  Credit and trust will be tied to online identities rather than real identities and BTC credit markets will open and eventually (but very slowly) gain traction and liquidity.

Those that require more confirmations for the malleability issue are misinformed.  Once the transaction is accepted into a block, it's not an issue.  Confirmations and transaction malleability have very little to do with each other.
If you wait for 3 confirmations, your risk for double spending is identical regardless of the transaction malleability issue.

What next... denying based on race, creed, and color?  Is it legal for them to deny you based on your political beliefs?  BTC is a very hot button political topic.
As a community, yes there is an easy way to fix this.  So what you're telling me is that you were judged based on how you spend your money.  If only there was a way to buy anonymously... oh wait.  But seriously, I'm very sorry about what happened to you.  In the future when BTC takes off, this will be a non issue at least.
For the time being, you can try to fight it.  I'd ask them "what news?".  Ask them specifically what reason they denied you.  Clearly it's not for financial reasons.  The stigma associated with Bitcoin is a shame.  I'm sorry that you were a martyr for our cause.

Not all withdrawals are going though.  I think they're doing it manually.  Only 1 out of 8 people I know have received theirs yet.
It seems they are allowing SOME withdrawals, but NOT all just FYI.

I think the leak was around June 2011, so it is possible that your password was brute forced from this hash.  If I recall correctly, they used SHA256 (the same hashing algorithm that Bitcoin uses) so in a tragic twist of irony, this community is the best at cracking it.
I would definitely follow through with them to check if your account is verified and if you have any balance.  Who knows, maybe you're a millionaire and don't even know it.

Your "hard evidence" was an image of a chart that was posted here tons of time already with a similar looking chart of the MtGox price with a title of "I told you so!".
I'm not sure if you're just trolling or if you really have no clue what was wrong with that post...
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:53:47
Right! I'm just saying that they could technically go all the way down to 0.43 and still profit.
0.43 is the break even point. 0.7 is the current value. That's such a huge arbitrage opportunity for anyone holding goxbtc right now.
