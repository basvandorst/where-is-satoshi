You have to use the seed from blockchain if that is the wallet which you used

Yes I made a child pays for parent transaction through electrum, and I have now gotten 3 confirmations now.

I wouldn't mind paying $1-$3 for it to confirm soon, but it is my understanding that it isn't possible for me to raise my fee now.

Is there anything I can do to raise the fee? I read that it is possible to double spend, but how would I do that? My wallet provider is blockchain.com and it doesn't seem like it is possible from there.
On the  website it says that it will be up to 1140 minutes, but it has already been 48 hours so that isn't true.

I managed to do a child pays for parent through electrum, and i have now gotten my first confirmation. Thank you very much for the help!

Whether or not this works, i don't think i will be using blockchain.com wallet again, and i will setup an Electrum wallet.

Any idea how many days?

Is it possible to cancel the transaction now and maybe transfer the Bitcoins to an electrum wallet? Or just cancel the transaction and resend it with a higher fee?
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:10:24
How long would it be before the transaction is evicted from the network? And would I get all my bitcoins back when it is evicted?

It's pretty easy, but there are some expressions and stuff that i atleast did not know. But you should be able to figure it out, otherwise you can just ask.

I don't think a child pays for parent transaction is possible on blockchain.com unfortunately. I think my best option is to wait until it is either evicted or confirmed, which is pretty annoying. In the meantime I will setup an Electrum wallet, because it seems like blockchain.com is pretty useless.

Wouldn't it go through at some point at 120sat/B? It has been over 48 hours and not a single confirmation
