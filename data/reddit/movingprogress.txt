No one knows, no one ever knows. Its like looking at frog spawn in a pond and asking how big the frog will get. You can know everyrhig about the environment and how other frogs faired but you can never know how its gonna pan out.

It's not for investment purposes. Buy it use it and yeah save it up. As more people adopt it will go up but only as long as people actually use it. Hodl=stalemate. The risk is only short term, and you will lose short term, over all be sweet though.

Bitcoin doesn't have an ego though. And what it does have is not able to me manipulated, people are trying but they're getting nicely fucked over for their efforts. BTC goes down give it a few days and the coin that that coingeek guy shit out goes up a little bit, probably before he does his preaching. that's not gonna end well for him. BTC will survive because if that, inherently resilient.

We do need to overhaul the whole education system in its entirety that is for sure, we are teaching our children how to be consumers we barley get taught how to grow our own fruit and veg and zero animal rearing. Essentially taught in some way or another that we just buy all we need, bringing up people that rely on the system. We could be teaching them all the basics of being human that we have learnt over the last tens of thousands of years, shit like jam making, cheese making, beer, foraging, curing meat, building, social skills all the stuff that got us this far because that stuff really can make money, and enough to pay for a house(that you build) and car. We have so many people that appreciate these things so demand is there and an internet and a pretty stream lined mode of distribustion. Weve expedited all the things we hold dear and work dead end jobs to pay  for some sub par products ( that some people get paid shit wages to make) that badly substitute the real thing and often time no longer good for you.
We wouldn't need tax as it is now if we all got fair price for our efforts, we can no longer compete in a market that can manufacture everything cheaper (albeit lower quality) and have a huge store with minimal rents on every corner. The human race didnt realise what it was giving up when it started to expedite all of its usual day to day tasks. Obviously health ( wtf is even going on with health services and insurance company's) and roads should have a tax but we dont need governments for that just a new system.
 This is a learned helplessness that stemmed from our education system and a generation of people that started to have more time on their hands and not knowing how to inspire their children for the (then) unknown future but not wanting them to have to slog for their wages like they did. They saw a future that was going to be easier, having taken for grante it is the work itself is what makes us happy. Liberal freedom im not even getting into. You need to fight for equality and freedom at all times as soon as you let your guard down this shit happens. You are not born with rights or freedom you have to fight for it, every generation. The last 30 years we all just be chilling and have forgot how we got here, possibly cause of a war, who knows.

Absolutely, couldn't agree more. Just a scary thought, not sure everyone is gonna be willing to pay the emergency services bills, basic educational and welfare bills. Very important we factor those and a few other things into the rebellion of fiat because if we dont we are pissing on a lot of what has made us great as humans so far. Dont throw the baby out with the bath water kinda thing. It is the most complex game.
