Ok. Thank you for the explanation :)

Noobish question but what does segwit mean? Seen it thrown around a lot but haven't understood it yet

Ok, let's rephrase, what should I use to avoid to be screwed over? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:10:33
I like that 2018(8)

Ok, that's well. I kinda figured since China is a big player on the market that it would be hard for them to ban it, but that makes more sense. Thank you for the info :)

I live in Sweden, so I'm used to taxes and getting screwed by those :)

What wallet is the best one to use to be able to trade Bitcoin for real life money? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:42:16
You have cold weather in the UK, ask anyone how their Leaf handles that

So Bitcoin.de would allow me to trade safely and easily between crypto and eur with withdraws to my real life bank account?

Could anyone explain why China banned Bitcoin and how it'll affect the long term market? 
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:47:18
Think of it this way: if it costs less but is faster, a miner can handle more transactions in the same time. Sure they'll be worth less individually, but the combined sum might still be close to the same

You do know that the real idea behind Bitcoin is to replace money? Using it as a real currency disconnected from its "real world" value is the only way. You don't pay extra to the clerk just because the market may collapse the next day

Nah, I'm only hodling, no buying right now

In Swedish krona it's 67k right now, I'd gladly take that in USD for btc
