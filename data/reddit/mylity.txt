I'm Venezuelan, i can confirm it is in fact complete bullshit.
Bitcoin farms here are illegally seized by the secret police and then put back to work for government officials. But hey, they only ever find you if you have racks and racks consuming large amounts of electricity.
So long you keep your operation below 2000KWh everything should be fine.

We also need a way to have savings, Cryptos are a super nice way to have money in a place our government can't touch it and where it won't loose 10% of its value per day due to stupidly high hyperinflation.
The only other way to have savings here is buying easy-to-sell assets with your pay. Wich is usually food to be later sold in the black and gray markets.
Yes, there is a food black market here.

I'm sorry to say this, but as a Venezuelan i assure you that it was 20 years of overspending, oil dependency and no investment what led to the current situation here. Of course government officials like to blame external factors for their own gross incompetence and corruption.
I can guarantee you that if they ever do anything with cryptos, its gonna be just regulating them to make it next to impossible for a regular joe to get them, and if they do, they would face jail-time.
The secret police over here has been illegally seizing farms for quite some time now but you think they get dismantled? nope, they mysteriously go back to work only that now they are farming bitcoins for some government official probably way high up.
