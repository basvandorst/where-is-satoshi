there is this upgrade called eltoo aka SIGHASH_NOINPUT which will permit channel factories and millions of channels opened/closed per block
this in combination with schnorr signatures (and signature aggregation) will solve scalability of LN
as usual bcrashers do not have arguments, just propaganda and lies
@_date: 2018-09-13 23:30:04
eltoo is just a flag. it's very easy to code and it will probably be implemented in the next soft fork. it's 2019 stuff
"toxic waste" is what is preventing channel factories to be built today because it grows exponentially with the number of participants in a channel.
and channel factories will scale much much more then 10x it's something in the range of 1000x or 10000x
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:43:11
no, tesla sucks
lambos are far far better
@_date: 2018-09-17 11:44:20


in practice it is as much as mandatory cause toxic waste grows exponentially with number of participants in the channel


i'm more optimistic than you, but time will tell
p.s. LN can be used from sidechains as well so we don't have scale problems
@_date: 2018-09-14 09:36:41
eltoo means you sign a different portion of the transaction. it's trivial. it's REEEEALLY a trivial fork.
that said if core wants to postpone it to package it with others forks i don't know. maybe it's possible, anyways we are talking about LN scalability, so it doesn't matter if it comes next year or 2021, long term we are still ok


yes, the fewer people the easier it is, but my cell phone is always online and so are the vast majority of all cells phones, so coordinating hundreds of phones it's not a big deal. and if you want a mesh network you need to open 3/4/5 channel, etc today, with factories you just need 1.
because of this my i believe the worst case scenario is something like x1000 long term


taproot and graftroot are here to save onchain space


scalability matters long term so i'm not concerned about 3rd world connectivity

@_date: 2018-09-24 07:58:55
nope. onchain tx do not have to increase, at least not for LN. Right now 4MW blocks can support all the earth population with ease.
as a matter of fact LN works better with small blocks because you need to run it on your phone for day to day payments and you need a full node to connect with, ideally your home full node
@_date: 2018-09-17 12:29:06


didn't know about that. i'll check


you are supposed to keep on sidechains just your wallet money and keep the bulk of your savings on the mainchain. thus the risk would be acceptable.


would love to read more about that
@_date: 2018-09-16 19:08:21


ok, it will not be implemented next year? fine. this is a long term scalability feature. right now bare LN is more than enough to scale


in a mesh network every participant needs 3/4/5 channels. with CF you just need 1, so you must multiply for all these channels saved


my point is that hopefully in the medium term connectivity problems will be worked out
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:33:25
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:23:14
oh please, core coded a thing called segwit which enables bitcoin's scalability.
miners are stalling it for political reasons.
bitcoin not growing is miner's fault (jihan's fault)
@_date: 2017-03-30 02:02:45
the whole point of UASF is to force miners to run the upgrade. if miners do not comply they are out of the network. it's their problem.
@_date: 2017-03-30 01:47:03
satoshi outlined in the whitepaper that 1 CPU = 1 vote so UASF is a perfectly legit way for user to exercise their power.
more so UASF is a mechanism already used in Bitcoin so nothing new under the sun. 
what's so extremist about segwit?
you feel that forcing miners to do their job could be in any way extremist?
@_date: 2017-03-30 01:55:52
sorry, i dont see the "that actually mines" clause anywhere in the paper.
and in fact Satoshi referred to users in the paper, not to miners, otherwise he would have spoken about hashing power, not CPUs
the power of a CPU was different from one another. so why using a gross concept like "CPU" if you really intended hash rate? that makes no sense
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:36:43


why don't you merge segwit already?
can't you see how bad thing are getting?
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:50:54
oh please, with LN transactions will be off-chain. so no delay
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:46:33
of course. but the fact that nodes do not mine today does not mean nodes (aka users) are not the ones who are entitled to decide rules.
the statement is clear, it says that nodes vote and the means with which they vote
"Nodes work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, **expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by** working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."
you see? the power is clearly in the hands of users and mining is just a means by which that power is wielded
@_date: 2017-03-30 03:02:40
forking the network is the best (and the only) path forward right now.
there are 2 different visions for BTC
- a decentralized protocol that preserves freedom for it's users and scales off-chain
- a semi-centralized protocol where miners have the power that scales on-chain
right now nobody wants to compromise with the other side (me included) so the split is the only possible solution
@_date: 2017-03-30 02:10:42
this is directly from the white paper:
"Nodes work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis.  Nodes can
leave   and   rejoin   the   network   at   will,   accepting   the   proof-of-work   chain   as   proof   of   what happened while they were gone.  They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them.  Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."
is there anything more to say?
as you can see it is clearly stated that nodes can implement needed rules by rejecting invalid blocks

this is not true. 
on r/bitcoin there is no censorship. as you see you are here claiming this sub is censored while suffering no penalties. isn't it somehow counter factual?
it is true that on r/bitcoin there is "moderation" for "off-topic" stuff, but this is clearly specified in the rules and as long as you stay in topic you can say whatever you want.
pretending that a sub dedicated to bitcoin is effectively dedicated to discussing bitcoin hardly qualifies as censorship

users always trust the devs in a softfork, and the code is public and up for review.
the hash will not be created out of thin air but you will publish the hash-creating code as well
maybe you can do a double softfork: the first softfork calculates the hash and puts it into the coinbase, the second softfork writes the hash in the consensus code and cuts the chain
i cant see the difference with a regular soft fork and this


why does this matter? 
as long as the hash is first calculated by code that is publicly available and reviewed and tested and accepted by everyone where is the problem?
once the hash is in the coinbase and enough time is passed we can be sure it is safe
than we can bring it to the consensus code with no risk, no matter how many bitcoins it does contain


here you will see as well: we do 2 softforks with public code so everybody can see and detect problems. how is this any different?
why cant everybody see if an hash of the utxo set is correct or not? 
this should be possible with great ease 
@_date: 2016-12-17 16:04:34
why can't we solve this problem with a softfork?
we make a snapshot of all the past UTXOs plus relevant stuff, we make an hash and then commit the hash in the coinbase.
then we put the hash in the consensus code, cut the old chain and now we can IBD with near 0 costs
@_date: 2018-06-25 07:12:42
I hope LN becomes centralized with an hub&amp;spoke topology.
this would lead to a great efficiency of the system and it's ultimate growth and usefulness
btw decentralization is only needed on the base layer. on the second one it's just redundant

hi, is the payment channel feature ready as well?

@_date: 2016-12-18 01:57:50
if we put the hash of the history in the consensus code we just have maximum security.
no one can rewrite it once it's in the consensus code
it'd be like block 1 that is coded in the consensus code
and you clean up 100Gb of old history
and the trust in the devs would be exactly the same that we have right now. 
what if the devs make a bogus softfork? 
it is the exactly same risk, isn't it?
@_date: 2018-06-20 09:05:26
Exactly. In r/btc you can write 1 comment and then if you are not liked you can write no more, with no way to express your opinions

inflation is an unnatural state for the economy where you gain for being indebted and the savers loose purchasing power over time
to create inflation you need to print money and this is a transfer of wealth from the poor guys to banks and rich guys
this transfer also harms the broad economy by making it less efficient as a whole 
with deflation all of these bad things do not happen, economy is stronger and sounder.
yes, big banks and politician hate deflation because it cuts into their privileges but, frankly, who cares?
@_date: 2018-03-17 10:35:40
the problem with banks/hubs/centralized stuff is not that they are big or bad, but that they can censor you or freeze/steal your funds or break your privacy
LN has none of these problems since it relies on bitcoin decentralization so even if it ends up being centralized (which i doubt) it won't be a problem and it will only have the good part of centralization: high efficiency
@_date: 2018-03-26 10:50:40

"subjective preferences"
every individual feels rich at his own point. but if i get richer by my savings gaining purchasing power at some point i'll feel rich. 
anyways while i become richer i'll tend to spend more.
so the hoarder at some point stops / starts spending more, but we don't know until it happens and it's different for every one of us
imagine this: you win the lottery. will you spend more? probably. 
money deflation is like slowly winning the lottery. 
as you become richer at some point you just start spending more

yes it does. where did you find this silly notion that regulated markets are free? :O


you either are free or you are not. if you compromise on freedom you are no longer free. and we have all witnessed in the past decades what happens when we start compromising on freedom, don't we. it's a downhill road. 


ehm, this is just your opinion and it's wrong...


so let me see how your argument works out: you are afreaid that someone could be turned into slavery so you are willing to surrender yourself and your fellow men into voluntary servitude? ehm, no thanks. i prefer to be free and take my chances in a free society rather than being a slave in a socialist society.


you seem a fool to me. government is evil


this is just your opinion and i cant even begin to understand why you believe it


so to be uberwealthy with 100 is dangerous but to be uberwealthy with 40 it is not? weird statement


so powerful and useful that you want government to regulate the market.. this is another inconsistency in your reasoning


ehm no! in countries where government is smaller people are more free and more rich. this is hard data, and can't be questioned


there is no such thing as an impure socialism. you either redistribute wealth or you do not. Funny thing is socialists always want to redistribute other people's wealth, never their own...
why don't you propose to redistribute only the wealth belonging to fellow socialists instead of everybody's wealth?
why should my wealth be redistributed if i don't believe in socialism? when socialists will stop to redistribute my wealth i'll stop calling socialism evil


as far as i know socialism has no advantages, just disadvantages.
you have a lot of opinions which are not supported by facts as far as i'm aware

@_date: 2017-09-10 19:21:58
if your investment is good you will find a loan even at a rate of 10% or 15%
on the other hand a questionable investment will not be undertook and this is a net positive for the economy.
every investment consumes wealth. a good investment pays back with more wealth, a bad one just destroy your resources so you should not do it.
it's simple.


this is bogus. producers produce if there is demand. when prices are low demand grows. how many cars would you buy for 1 billion each? and how many card would you buy for 1$ each?
would you not buy a car for 1$ if that same car is going to be priced at 0.96$ the next year?
just answare these questions and you will understand ;)
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:57:05

can we have a fast chat about it? even in private?
if i'm wrong i'll gladly state it wherever you want
@_date: 2017-09-10 22:57:57


not all investments are created equal. investing in a car factory is different from opening a mall which is different from buying securities and so on and on.
deflation hampers only the worst investments. so no damage to growth.
it is really not so hard to understand.


it was many years ago and i don't have it anymore.


Bitcoin will replace $ and it is deflationary. people will learn how deflation works and will enjoy it. no need for me to convince you or any other guy. bitcoin will do the trick for me. and when it does your theories will be nothing more than trash.
that's all. i'll win the argument just by waiting
@_date: 2017-09-08 09:51:28
to invest you need savings. deflation increases your savings and makes you more likely to invest.
you can have whatever ROI you want, but if you don't have savings you cannot invest. full stop.
with inflation you have less savings and you need to borrow. this has very bad consequences like 2008
if you hoard currency you make everybody else richer. if other people are richer they will on average consume more and invest more and grow the economy.
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:28:19


ahh "despite"... you are free to believe that, but inflation is and remains a drag on growth, no matter what you believe ;)


so actively that they are failing to do it... a willing central bank can print its way to devaluation, but somehow Swiss central bank is not. what a weird thing, don't you agree?
sry but i dont have historical data on hand.
anyway a country can grow despite inflation (even if it grows less in the long run) so if 30 years ago Swiss had inflation this proves nothing besides Swiss grew less than it could. 
on the contrary the fact that Swiss is growing now with deflation disproves the bogus arguments of "onky donky deflationary death spiral" and "people skip purchases when the currency is deflationary"
i pardon your sarcasm, dont worry. 
i suggest, if you have time, you plot the net per capita wealth today in developed countries with the cumulative rate of inflation in the given country during the last 30 - 40 years. 
who knows what surprises await you ;)

@_date: 2017-09-08 00:48:59
your arguments are bogus.
people save more if real rates get higher, not if there is deflation/inflation.
if inflation is -2% and nominal rate is 1% i'll save little money, if inflation is 5% and nominal rate is 20% i'll save a lot more.
the accumulation of power happens when someone controls the printing press, not when someone hoards money.

@_date: 2017-09-10 22:09:22


yes, but in inflation scenarios people tend to overinvest and squander resources.


ok good! and why this should be bad?
Econ101: savings are key to growth.
this btw was the 8th chapter in my old econ textbook
so if i consume a little less and save a little more i'll get more growth. it's really simple and easy.
btw i'm not thinking in extremes, i'm just showing you that your arguments are nuts pointing out what happens in extremes. if your arguments were sane they would hold up even in extremes circumstances, but they are not.


and what if it's 2017 and i can buy bitcoins? 
this will discourage purchasing as well. no need for deflation


fine ;)

your bogus theories are going the way of the dinosaurs, no matter what you say/believe/hope.

it would just took more time to do the trick

if you are poor why on earth should you borrow????
you need to work hard and save. and you wont be able to invest for a long long time.
if you have small savings deflation magnifies them and let you invest sooner
if hoarding is convenient everybody hoards money and prices fall. when prices have fallen enough people start spending again. it's that simple. and in the process everybody is richer because money hoarded is more valuable

what about the disabling of op_codes? wasn't that an hardfork even if nobody used them? just asking
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:34:28
because a blocksize to big can severely harm decentralization and there are better ways to scale, plus the change is far too rushed and insecure and this could financially harm people, plus it was a backdoor agreement and it is unethical, plus a lot of other reasons
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:13:14
just guessing:
50% tx are batched and they count as a segwit tx even if they have only 1 sw input. thus the number is smaller than it appears
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:40:09
do you know how "Signed transaction value in input " works in details or where i can find them?
this is the part i'm interested in

what is "cypherpunk AF" ?
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:26:47
LN is layer 2. even if it get centralized it cannot damage layer 1 nor change the rules of the network. on the contrary centralizing layer 1 can
this is the whole difference

why should we "reduce" security? if we do things in a smart way we can get increased security.
we just need 2 soft forks. it's trivial!

hi Greg, is there any working trick to hash the old utxo set in the the coinbase and cut the old chain?
if so, is it going to be implemented?
@_date: 2017-05-06 23:58:04
if we all vote, maybe segwit could be activated faster. 
PLEASE VOTE!!!!
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:18:24
eh oh a pray for the other 1/10th of the community
let's split!!
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:28:27
because time does matter
why get segwit in october if you can get it in august?
@_date: 2017-05-19 12:43:00
who cares?
how has this any impact on us or on bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:24:39
you do not understand. that's it
@_date: 2017-05-19 12:47:07
ehm, are you sure this attack works?
i have serious doubts...
once UASF is activated segwit rules are enforced so nobody can steal funds from you
i can just now write a bitcoin hardfork that steels all the bitcoins and give them to me. it's the same thing and it is not relevant at all
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:40:54
If someone does then means the sha 256 is broken and we can replace blocks as we please. Remember that pow and link between blocks are hashs as well.
It would be armageddon for bitcoin even without utxo commitments
@_date: 2018-12-09 10:47:16
In consensus code there is already the genesis block. Why not change it with a newer one made from utxo commitment?
Why should we validate history if it cant change anymore and it s accepted as a new genesis block?
Is it rrally that different if the bitcoin history starts in 2009 or in 2015?
@_date: 2018-12-09 10:25:11
Why keep the old history if we can set in stone the utxo writing it in consensus code? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:17:51
1. there is a lot of opposition to the hardfork. i'm opposed to it as well and the vast majority of people i know interested n bitcoin ar eopposed as well. i'd say it is VERY contentious. therehave never be an hardfork in bitcoin. never ever.
2. running a node is more costly and this is a bad thing. a lot of nodes have dropped off the network in the past years due to cost
3. segwit transactions are handled on chain
4. coin.dance does not show support for EC and segwit. coin.dance just shows how many blocks are signalling segwit and EC which are two completely different things. most of the ecosystem is indeed ready for segwit because they already upgraded their code
@_date: 2017-06-28 01:38:50
yes, but users could use lower fees and they would benefit as well
@_date: 2017-06-09 09:26:28
what about making segwit discount editable with a soft fork to slightly increase blocksize in the future without an hardfork?
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:31:41
1 miners are not a "technological sample" as well. they do not use bitcoin, it is a business to them, so they will never have users interest in mind, just their own profit.
2 over time a blocksize increase will be ok, not now.
3 the blocksize is raised with segwit so security is weaker. any blocksize increase weakens security
4 i guess you should rethink your miners assessment. they are out there to profit, they do not give a fuck about bitcoin nor about it's users and their opinion should be valued 0
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:38:53
I still dont understand why we cant do a utxo commitment in the coinbase, make a softfork to require block x to have that commitment and cut the old chain.
This is as decentralized as any other softfork and cleans the problem away
What's the problem if the WHOLE bitcoin community agrees the first 8 years of history are set in stone and cannot be modified anymore? 
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:16:24
1 they are not, they do not hold bitcoins
2 there are several technical arguments why right now we cant. the only thing we can do safely is scaling off chain with sidechains and LN. too long to go in depth here. just search the internet
3 because it makes running a node more expensive -&gt; less decentralization -&gt; less security
4 they do not. they spend billions on electricity which is burned right away and on mining hardware that lasts for 2 years at best. they do not care about long term security or health of bitcoin, just short term profit. 
the system was designed to have individual users mining blocks, not professional business. one of the greatest problems in bitcoin is mining centralization which is happening now.
just an example: USA propose the miners to adopt BTC instead of USD as legal tender. in exchange Trump asks blacklisting of transactions and antiprivacy softforks. which is the interest of the users? which is the interest of the miners? as you can see the 2 are outright opposite. 
do you understand where we are going with this? price is just a so small part of it...
the minute you compromise on bitcoin's core principles bitcoin dies
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:18:09


can you pleas eelaborate? what was the technical problem?
@_date: 2017-06-13 08:59:07


do you know that Bitcoin in the words of Satoshi himself is an implementation of Nick Szabo's Bitgold?
do you know that Bitgold was a settlement layer with a second layer for everyday transactions?
do you know the blocksize limit was imposed on Bitcoin by Satoshi himself?
do you know Satoshi was the one to theorize payment channels on Bitcoin in order to scale off chain?
do you know that the Lightning Network is nothing but an implementation of Satoshi's original payment channels?
does any of these facts make you feel the need to reevaluate your opinions? just asking...
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:40:51
satoshi imposed the blocksize limit at 1 Mb
do you think he was an idiot not to understand that a max of 330k tx/day could be processed?
and anyways he explicitly make reference to nick szabo bitgold which has a settlement layer + a 2nd layer for daily transactions
