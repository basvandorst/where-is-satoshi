Bitcoin means the world to me. I now look at it as digitised freedom. It's like the freedom to not have health insurance. Or the freedom to not wear a motorcycle helmet, but better. Each time I use bitcoin I realize that there's no need for any other truth than Satoshi's truth. It saddens me that banks are still able to offer loans, and credit cards. Bitcoin removes the need for these things that simply enslave us. Bitcoin, is life.

In my opinion Bitcoin is without question the most dangerously stupid financial innovation I've ever witnessed. No only does it empower early adopters in a 'pyramid scheme' nature, it lacks the most fundamental elements of financial utility. What makes people who support it so willing to hand all transactional power to the vendor (for example). How would someone get a mortgage in BTC? How can anything so easily manipulated be seen as a slightly reasonable solution to a problem that doesn't exist? 
It's a true example of a disenfranchised minority attempting to push a solution that is far worse than a non existing problem.

What about a shop that has 'must have' items which only accepts Bitcoin.
For example, a top quality fedora shop. People would want the fedoras but would be blocked by their lack of Bitcoin, we could place an ATM by the front door and make people pay to enter the establishment.
On a larger scale we could have entire Bitcoin malls that people need to enter in such a way.
Something that excludes those that don't believe in Bitcoin could by peer pressure force people to get involved.

Because Bitcoin is unregulated and is backed by nothing. It's a faith based commodity. As one may expect as soon as faith is rocked the value plummets.

If you think attempting to give someone something they don't want is promotion, you're right it's brilliant.

Involved in shilling. Makes sense. It's all this joke of a 'currency' is good for. Making a quick buck ripping off the people stupid enough to think it's a good idea.

Okay, I'll hand it to you. You're not like most of the Bitcoin types I've encountered. I see why people want to believe in Bitcoin. I really do. The thing is, the issues that people have with banks (and I'm talking in general here, not targeting you). Tends to be those at the bottom of the fiscal ladder. I've never had any issues with banks and take a nice holiday per year with my credit card reward points.
I pay no interest on my card as it just clears itself in full each month, I get cash back, access to premium airport lounges, I have no issues sending money to people internationally or locally. The fees paid (if any) are quite insignificant. I just don't see any value in Bitcoin. I know you totally disagree with me but it just sets of alarm bells as being a new type of scam. One we've not seen before. The reason for not wanting to take you up on your offer is simply that I don't want to take your 'money'.  There are people that need it and deserve it far more than I. 
But as I said previously, thanks for the offer. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 15:34:08
You're almost right. Shale oil has pushed the price down - Saudi can afford to take a hit on the price of oil as their supply is plentiful. If the price goes down enough it will not be cost effective for shale companies to continue and they will go bankrupt. At this point, prices will rise again.

The primary problem with Bitcoin is the community. I guess that's why you don't see people fighting in Dogecoin for example.

What a load of crap. Privacy? Your transaction history is public via the blockchain. No need to enter personal information? Oh, how about when you create a coinbase account.

If Circle had no idea of the for mentioned facts regarding credit cards and their associated fees for cash advances then I'd question their ability to run a business at all. It takes a certain level of incompetence (which seems strangely unique to Bitcoin companies) to completely fail to do any sort of due diligence. 
The reality is, taking cash or credit and buying a commodity/currency to utilize in your resident market is ridiculous. Failure is inevitable when your core business is providing a redundant service which by it's nature is attempting to disrupt the industry that your business requires in order to operate.

@_date: 2014-08-31 02:45:24
The thing is. I couldn't care less what you think. Interestingly enough, you seem to care an awful lot about what I think. 
Facts: Shrem admits he's cooperating with the Feds (I don't imagine he's selling himself out as you don't get a plea deal for that). 
After cooperating he pleads guilty to a lesser charge. 
In an interesting twist,  at exactly the same time as this transpires more changes are added in the silk road case. Let's not forget, Charlie's case is tied to silk road. 
If you're unable to grasp these facts, and want to try and counter by rambling like a fool, so be it.

Seeing as you have problems with finance let me help. If I buy something today for 1000 dollars and the next day the price of that item drops to 500 dollars I've lost 50% of my potential liquidity.

I feel for the guy. I really do. But the remorse he feels is simply because he got caught. He felt he was untouchable, he made a circus out of the court with the abjectly terrible 'defense' his lawyers came up with and he's dragged his family name through the dirt as his poor mother proclaimed his innocence. 
He's not some innocent scamp, he peddled all sorts of life destroying wares on an industrial scale for personal gain. The fact that he had the audacity to order 'hits' on his enemies goes further to prove he's scum. 
Should he do life? No, clearly that's unreasonable. Even 20 years is crazy. Yes, the sentence doesn't match the crime. Welcome to America, best check out these things before you break the law on such a scale.

To get back on point, Bitcoin ATMs will fail as they're not needed and overly complicated. As soon as someone sees the joke of a process required to sign up, it will be apparent to them.
I find it somewhat amusing that a simple error is so amazing to you. Dear God, grow up. You are part of a Ponzi scheme, plain and simple. One day you'll wake up and see that.

It's not better. It's vastly worse for reasons so abundant there's no real need to go over them again. Bitcoin is a total mess. The majority of those invested are just desperate. The sharks that pump it are like preachers, promising salvation from poverty.

Fair enough. But still, a big problem with any asset/currency with a deflationary nature is you'll never be able to offer a credit system with it.

Terrible for consumers. 


Bitcoin isn't credit. How is this relevant? 


Just like you do when you pay in cash, right? 


You can't go overdrawn. Overdrafts are there to help you. With Bitcoin you just can't buy what you can't afford (if you could buy it with Bitcoin at all). 


How do you aquire Bitcoin without a middle man, are we talking about mining here or something? 


They can see everything you own via the blockchain and force you to give it up. 


You're joking? Have you not seen the authentication methods used by the likes of Circle, Coinbase and Bitcoin ATMs? 


Bitcoin has been doing a fine job of losing value. My dollars are very stable. 


Wire transfer, Paypal, Venmo or just having enough cash with me by planning ahead. 


Oh, come on. You're getting desperate.


I agree it's definitely the least painful way to throw pennies at people. 


... 


You need currency to aquire Bitcoin.






If you don't mind the fees, the risk of price fluctuations and having to deal with a middle man to get your money out of it. 


Very useful for throwing pennies at people. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:24:25
Yes, but normally not adding that to a picture of you quoting yourself saying what you're saying on a forum for saying what you're saying so you can show everyone you like what you said.

@_date: 2018-02-05 20:26:23
The reason they issued it was to stop the fees associated with cashing in/out of crypto to USD. Because fees were meaning people were losing 2% moving from crypto to USD (and so forth). By using Tether 'pegged' to USD (as there's supposed to be 1 USDT - USD in a bank somewhere) they could get around this and lower fees to 0.01% (or something). Obviously this seemed great and people ate it up. The problem is nobody knows if they have USD to cover the USDT currently issued. That and the fact that USDT are now floating around on other exchanges and perhaps some people don't know USDT isn't USD is a huge potential disaster.

Now, about that 60% price drop. How do all those people 'protecting their wealth' feel about that? Or are they just in your imagination? Along with those old people who were apparently talking about the fall of the Euro. 
Those voices, do you hear them now? Are they getting louder?
