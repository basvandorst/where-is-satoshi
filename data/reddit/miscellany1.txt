Thank you very much for the info but I wouldn’t want to do any business that isn’t viable.... which is more viable between a miner and a trader?

Yea I understand it involves risk.... do you know any link or book about trading?

Thank you but I think I’m more interested in being a trader now...... my country can’t even boast of 12 hrs electricity per day .
