As a developer that works with making Bitcoin websites that have trading in them, I can say my first response was "What does this guy do?" - I mean if I know how to code it than why do I need him telling me what to code?

Our initial offering will be automated against the house games. We are targeting this market because many people are put-off by the competitive edge you can gain in pooled play.

House odds favor short-term gains over long-term gains. Playing against people who are working together to make you lose sucks both short and long term.

I am interested in a response to this from a non-programmer.

Welcome to the Bitcoin community. There are a ton of exchanges, but we welcome more!


FOREX is just another exchange market really.


Some exchanges support triggers, conditions, etc. and other options. Many people are using exchanges just for liquidity during this early adoption period, so don't let the current boom in exchanges trick you into thinking this is a permanent speculative environment.

I have played on their site and I love it actually. Those guys are really cool. Maybe we'll try and buy them out.

Our initial offering will include:
* Poker
* Blackjack
* Dice roll
* Rock Paper Scissors
However we are actually more oriented to being a Steam like platform where we provide the secure betting system and an SDK for others to make games with.
