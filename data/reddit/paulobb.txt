Have a read through the comments on this. I think the plan is to eventually have property and car ownership hosted on the Ethereum blockchain.

No more spurious than the idea that it is the Ethereum coins that are causing the recent drop in price.
The main address has been posted. You can follow the coins movement from there.

I think when it comes down to it, people shouldn't be throwing shit at each other because they choose to align themselves with a different blockchain technology.
Right now the most important thing for everyone is the technology's proliferation in society.
Bitcoin will have its place, as will Ethereum. Let's just be glad we have so many incredibly intelligent and driven individuals working to create a better future for us all!

Classic r bitcoin. If I bury my head in the sand then the issues aren't issues and nothing will stop us getting to the moon! Let's post nice things and the price will go up, right?
Seriously though. It's a very real possibility that Chinese/Russian/USA govenments already hold large amounts of BTC. Why wouldn't they?
It is potentially an incredibly disruptive technology which would directly challenge their power. Compared to their budgets buying a few million BTC over a period of time is pocket change.
is correct in saying this issue needs to be seriously addressed.

Alright Zuckerburg chill out!
You got beaten this year, just try a little bit harder next time ok?

If there was actually any evidence to suggest that this...

If you actually follow the Ethereum coins none so far appear to be in an exchange's wallet. They have been divided up into wallets with 20-120~ coins for mostly wages it would seem.

Ask permission for funding? How can you possibly tell that Bitcoin didn't have millions or billions in funding from a government or private entity? Nobody knows the truth about Bitcoin, meaning there is a huge amount of uncertainty about its future. 
Imagine if Satoshi moved his coins? And without talk? Bitcoin would not be what it is today without its vast media coverage, which is certainly "talk" in my opinion.
Ethereum as far as I can see is trying to move as far away from centralised funding as possible, whilst being as open as possible about their work. There simply HAS to be a lot of talk and promises to get the crowd founders on board. It's worked to great affect and will hopefully lead to a really fantastic end result. If you were to mosey on down to the forums you would see there is a plethora of decentralised apps in the works already.
Anyway, time will tell whether it's a success or not. Try and form an opinion based on many sides of the story as opposed to what you have previously read on reddit.

Vaporware would suggest there is nothing to show, perhaps educate yourself on Ethereum's current iteration before making such assumptions.

I focused on "Bitcoin" and lost $30k... Love the tech, but willing to look at what else is going on out there.
