Split the 24 word seed into 2 pieces with 2 copies each. Keep 1 piece in a secure place in your home. 1 copy in another secure place that you can easily accessible that is not your home. Give the other 2 pieces to people you trust, they don't have to know each other and it might be better if they don't. Make whoever should receive the coins if something happens to you knows who has the pieces.
Obviously, different combinations of parts of the seed and trusted parties may be optimal for different people. You could split the seed up further, Although less than 8 word chunks may start to be brute force sensitive. 
In the end, just make sure compromise of any 1 geographic location or party wont result in loss of seed or theft of coins.

The title is not commenting on "transaction fees", what we think of when we tink of fees. They are commenting on the fee charged for minging contracts, people who send money to company to mine for them. 
This means ViaBTC is losing access to cheap electricity or has some other new business cost (bribery?). 
I see this as good news. If ViaBit is actually changing prices in a manner that makes them less competitive it is good evidence China really is putting pressure on miners. Subsidized mining will go away and the China &gt; 50% to threat that has always looked in the background will go away. The Bitcoin economy is becoming more decentralized and growing at the same time!

Increasing interest rates will increase incentivize people to hold USD because by definition USD can be loaned for more. It will slightly disincenntivize investing in crypto, but the driving forces for crypto dwarf a percent or 2 change in interest rates, so I don't think it will affect things too much. It will effect the stock market more.

Transaction fees are calculated by Ledger and any wallet in satoshi's/byte. Different transactions have different sizes measured in bytes. The more inputs (technically, unspent transaction outputs UTXO) that make up a transaction the larger the transaction size in bytes and the more satoshi's / higher fee necessary to incentivize miners to include it in the blockchain.  
It's not surprising the wallet with more addresses had a higher free. It probably grouped more addresses together. If you want fine grain control over what addresses are used, use your ledger with electrum.

He hypothesized the bank would issue the currency and implement obfuscation methods with encryption. Very forward thinking. Satoshi's brilliance was to solve the double spend problem without a trusted authority (bank). In that way, we don't have to trust the bank will volunteer obfuscation methods because they don't control the currency. Good find. I hope Chaum owns some Bitcoin!

This is legit. Eastern WA has cheap electricity. Over 70% of the states energy is hydroelectric. Wenatchee probably has one of the best quality of life / cost of electricity ratios anywhere. It's definitely a small place but has restaurants, good schools, hospitals, huge wine industry, etc.

A ledger nano S would make it a nice gift, but it might be more than the coin you are planning on giving him...
A cheaper option is to install Tails Operating system to a USB drive. It has electrum pre installed. Generate a wallet, send the coins, then give him the USB drive. 
As long as the internet is never connected (after installing an updating tails) after generation of the wallet with electrum the coins are secure. When he wants to spend/move them he will have to learn how to make an offline transaction.

Ledger/Trezor, the  write down your 24 word backup seed twice. Cut each piece of paper in half.  Make sure no single geographic location burning down can result in loss of your key. Ideally, make sure theft at a single geographic location can't put your key back together. Consider how you will make putting the seed back together known to your heirs.

[Some of the transactions]( seem to just be consolidating coins, but I still don't understand why they would use such a high fee.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:48:56
Whenever I create a transaction I head to  to get an idea of what fee will be necessary for a transaction in the next few blocks. Or, if you aren't time sensitive you can wait until you see it get really cheap. Transactions are expensive now because we are in the wake of one of the largest attacks on the Bitcoin block chain so far. The mem pool will clear and transactions will be cheaper again. Make sure your sending and receiving address are both segwit addresses to Minimize cost. (Segwit addresses start with a 3, not a 1). 
To figure your cost in dollars you need to multiple Satoshies/byte * transaction some in bytes * Bitcoin price in dollars / 100,000,000. If you don't know how big your transaction is assume it's 250 bytes. 
So for instance a 200 Satoshi/byte transaction with Bitcoin at $6000 would cost $3.

Side chains cannot be "ASIC resistant". All mining takes place on the main chain. Side chains allow for off chain transactions and instead of the main blockchain keeping a record of account the side chain does. Side chains operate without PoW blocks. (Although I'm sure you could make a side chain that used PoW blocks, and there is probably a reason too for some future economic situation) If a side chain has some sort of central operator, they could collect tx fee, however there will be times when the side chain needs to merge with the main chain and fees will have to be passed on. The lightning network has side chains, but does not have a central operator. However, I could imagine a scenario where a small number of institutions, like all of today's exchanges have a contract open almost all individuals to facilitate the lightning network, they may write their contracts in a way that they collect a transaction fee, but it would be very cheap relative to main chain. Again, from time to time when transactions collapse to the main chain, perhaps in big batches, using Schnorr signatures, the miners would collect a handsome fee. Of course we want them to collect this fee, it incentivize people to mine and keeps the network secure.

I would imagine then if my node is behind a VPN sometimes, and sometimes it is not, it would have 2 separate "identities". However, it should help the network out just as effectively. Although, if anyone else runs a full node behind the same VPN provider we could have a mixed identity...

The security and censorship resistance of the network depends on a large amount of expensive infrastructure that would be difficult for someone to be in control of. For some entity to censor transactions they would need &gt; 50 % of the hashrate. Considering that everyday the bitcoins reward for mining total over 10 million USD it is currently very difficult to control the network. However, it does not yet have enough inertia to be the immutable ledger we all want it to be. 
Mining Bitcoin is not Noble. It is profit driven. However, at certain time while Bitcoin is young some Miners mine with a much longer term perspective than others, which could be seen as Noble during times of uncertainty while the block chain is young.

I recently had a 1 block acceptance of a transaction in the 20-30 satoshi/byte range.
I use Johoe's Mempool Statistics to choose an appropriate fee.
I was about to make another and noticed a huge spike in transactions. As you can see in this image, I filtered out all transactions &lt; 600 sat/byte and there is ~0.8 MB of them.
I looked at blockchain.info and with a cursory look don't notice anything that stands out too much.
Anybody else have insight/another way of looking at these? Why would someone submit 600 sat/bye transactions when the network is accepting 20-30?

You don't have to buy bitcoins, but if someone is going to sell a future contract then it is prudent to purchase bitcoin. Otherwise, if the price rises higher than the contract price you will owe the difference. 
For instance, if you sell me 10 bitcoin contracts at  USD a contract due in February, then in February I have to buy them from you and you have to sell them to me no matter the price. Because it is settled in cash if the price is &gt; 10,000 then you owe me the difference and if the price is &lt; 10,000 I owe you the difference.
Notice the asymmetry, I stand to lose a maximum price of 10 contracts valued at 10,000 USD. You stand to lose an infinite amount as the price goes up. So, you probably need to purchase some Bitcoin to sell futures, or have some other large reserve of assets you can liquidate. 
I believe CME is responsible for making sure the futures people sell are covered by some sort of asset. I don't know what requirements they mandate.
Further reading about futures, their pricing, and arbitrage.

Make sure you have your 24 word seed written down in a safe spot. 
Also, I would recommend eventually having your coin secured by private keys in an offline wallet. Ideally, you would boot electrum on a live usb such as tails and keep the private key/seed safe, never on a device that was connected to the internet, and have a watch only copy of the wallet on your desktop with internet connection. To make a transaction you can create a transaction on the offline wallet, transfer it to a USB (or even better burn to CD) and then publish it to the network with your watch only wallet. 
A much easier method is to purchase a Ledger or Trezor, but it probably isn't worth it unless you have at least 10x the value of the hardware wallets cost in Bitcoin.

It is 0.8 MB, and its not 0.8 BTC, [its more like 10 BTC](
I think that makes it less likely it was just a careless mistake because it wasn't just one transaction.

Lightning network requires zero trust. It uses multi signature smart contracts. Both parties contribute some amount to an address that is dependent on a smart contracts conditions. You both pass back and forth signed messages, off chain, updating the balance of who owes who. At some point either of you can close the contract on chain by submitting the most recent balance. If someone tried to omit one of the transactionons  and close the contract in a state that favors themselves then the other party can divulge the proof of the fraud and all (or at least additional) funds go to the honest party. 
Zero trust necessary. Less frequent chain writes. And, this open doors for privacy because your transactions aren't all recorded on the block chain anymore.

I think hardware wallets are very useful and secure, but it's not the same as using Armory or something on a truly air gapped computer. Could a bug be found in Ledger / Trezor software that let's private keys leak? Could the random number generator used be weakened? Are they a big target because of their ubiquitousness? 
Also, I was hoping to use this for some currencies that don't have the same development as Bitcoin and don't have software deigned for this. Thus necessitating a block chain to be downloaded. 
I'm looking for software that facilitates maximum flexibility for various types of private keys and updates over the years in an offline computer.

Even with a complete Bitcoin take over of traditional financial systems there will still be banks. They won't be able to make as much money facilitating money transfer but they will still serve the vitally important function of making loans.
Of course, they won't be able to practice fractional reserve banking because they won't be able to call a "Trust_Us_Dollar" a real USD. 
They will need more deposits to facilitate loans in the absence of fractional reserve banking, so they will have to incentive deposits with real interest rates. It may be advantageous for individuals to deposit crypto in many different banks as a form of diversification and investment.
Ideally all of the banks loans and smart contracts and books will be published and auditable on a block chain.

As long as people agree crypto is a store of wealth or value people will work to accumulate it. When someone accumulates more of something than they need  it make since to loan it to someone else for a fee, otherwise your losing potential value. 
There may be peer to peer loans or other systems, but loaning money will not go away as long as money has value.

The link you sent links to a page with an even more detailed description: 
"To make the proof-of-work be bound to a service, or purpose, the hash must include s, a service string so the work becomes to find H(s,c)/2^(n-k)=0. The miner varies counter c until this is true. The service string could be a web server domain name, a recipients email address, or in bitcoin a block of the bitcoin blockchain ledger."
