As an american (which it seems clear you are), there is almost no way to understand what it means to be denied identity. There are people whose lives are hopeless because they can't prove who they are ever. 
Finally, any evil world government wants to track you, and they will track you, so stop pretending a blockchain identity scheme is really Dr. evil. Your photo was probably taken dozens of time today.

1. judging by age is foolish. Some of the best thinkers in this field are young. and we don't know satoshi's age. He could be younger than Todd.
2. I haven't seen one thing that Todd has said that has been proven to be wrong. He actually does the math before he speaks. That's a hell of a lot more than I can say for 150k folks here on this reddit thread.
3. Without Peter Todd playing the very astute devil's advocate, we could be in trouble. He's broadened the argument with great insight.

All three points you make are suspect.
1. What's your source for this claim? If a 51% attack was traceable we could code around it right now. But that's just not the case.
2. Sidechains at this point present extra risk, not security. And for them to even provide theoretical security in the future, its likely we will need a hard fork to implement.
3. Don't underestimate terrorists. Most destruction in history makes no sense to game theorists or economists. Some folks just like to watch things burn and are willing to pay big to do it.

As I understand it, if the institution does the signing, they are privatizing some of that information (and therefore centralizing). So yes, with onename you gain privacy at the loss of robustness and permanence. You would then require that company to stay in business and always keep a good relationship with the individual being identified (this is a danger in the developing country or war torn districts). 
It appears that most folks would like to have a permanent/unforgeable id and not necessarily one that is absolutely private (and therefore centralized). This is what idchains offers. Absolute permanence. Any verification they receive is provable for all time.
Though as I understand it, there are ways within idchains to keep the whole process private/anonymous as well.

Full article:
Gold is supposed to be a haven amid hard times and soft money. So why, even as Greece has defaulted, the euro has sunk against the dollar, and the Chinese stock market has stumbled, has gold been sitting there like a pet rock?
Trading this week below $1,150 an ounce, the yellow metal has fallen more than 39% since it peaked at nearly $1,900 in August 2011. Since June 2014, investors have yanked $3 billion out of funds investing in precious metals, estimates Morningstar, the financial-research firm; total assets at precious-metal funds have shrunk 20% in 12 months.
“A lot of investors have become disillusioned with gold,” says Suki Cooper, head of metals research at Barclays in New York. “Safe-haven demand hasn’t been strong enough to lift prices, but has only been strong enough to keep them from falling.”
Many people may have bought gold for the wrong reasons: because of its glittering 18.7% average annual return between 2002 and 2011, because of its purportedly magical inflation-fighting properties, because it is supposed to shine in the darkest of days. But gold’s long-term returns are muted, it isn’t a panacea for inflation, and it does well in response to unexpected crises—but not long-simmering troubles like the Greek situation. And you will put lightning in a bottle before you figure out what gold is really worth.
With greenhorns in gold starting to figure all this out, the price has gotten tarnished. It is time to call owning gold what it is: an act of faith. As the Epistle to the Hebrews defined it forevermore, “Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” Own gold if you feel you must, but admit honestly that you are relying on hope and imagination.
Recognize, too, that gold bugs—the people who believe in owning the yellow metal no matter what—often resemble the subjects of a laboratory experiment on the psychology of cognitive dissonance.
When you are in the grip of cognitive dissonance, anything that could be regarded as evidence that you might be wrong becomes proof that you must be right. If, for instance, massive money-printing by central banks hasn’t ignited apocalyptic inflation, that doesn’t mean it won’t. That means it is more likely than ever to happen—someday.
You don’t want to be one of these people, spending years telling reality that it is wrong. There is a case to be made for owning gold, but it speaks in a whisper, not in the shouts of doomsday so customary among gold bugs.
Because gold, unlike stocks, bonds, real estate and other financial assets, generates no income, valuing it is all but impossible. “It’s intrinsically worthless or intrinsically priceless,” says Paul Brodsky, a former hedge-fund manager who now is a strategist at Macro Allocation, an investment-research and consulting firm in New York. “You can build a financial model to value it, but every input is going to be your imagination.”
Gold is two things, neither of which is easy to price: a commodity and a currency.
First, the commodity: At recent prices, mining companies are losing money on more than an eighth of the gold they dig out of the ground, says Ms. Cooper of Barclays. That could lead to a decline in supply. And if demand—even from noninvestment buyers like consumers in China or India—rises unexpectedly, there might not be enough gold to go around.
William Rhind, chief executive of World Gold Trust Services, sponsor of SPDR Gold Shares, an exchange-traded fund with $26 billion in assets, also foresees what he calls “a continuing shift in demand from West to East, and from investors to consumers.”
Those factors, Ms. Cooper says, suggest that gold is unlikely to slide much lower and could eventually go quite a bit higher.
When? How much? Who knows?
As a currency, gold has a latent and indeterminate value, Mr. Brodsky says. If the world goes to financial hell in a handbasket, you wouldn’t lug gold ingots to the supermarket so you could stock up on canned goods. But you might pay for those goods with dollars that are again backed with gold, as they were until 1971.
The metal is “cumbersome and archaic and barbaric,” Mr. Brodsky says, “but it remains a store of value, and gold might be called upon again to be the basis for money, as a real backing of currency.” Basing the value of their money on something scarce, rather than the unrestricted right to run the printing press, would enable central banks to strengthen their currency, he says. It also would create a significant new source of demand for gold—if, that is, it ever happens.
Gold is often viewed as a hedge against inflation, and it has outpaced rises in the cost of living—but not as robustly as the alternatives.
Since 1975, the beginning of the period in which private ownership of gold has again been legal in the U.S., the metal has returned an average of 0.8% annually after inflation, compared with 5% for bonds, 8.3% for stocks and even 1.1% for cash, according to Christophe Spaenjers, a finance professor at HEC Paris business school. “It can be very difficult to rationalize the price movements of gold, even with the benefit of considerable hindsight,” he says.
So, if buying gold is an act of faith, how much money should you put on the line?
Laurens Swinkels, a senior researcher at Norges Bank Investment Management in Oslo, reckons that the total market value of the world’s financial assets at the end of 2014 was about $102.7 trillion. The World Gold Council estimates that the world’s total quantity of gold held for investment was about $1.4 trillion as of late 2014. So, if you held the same proportion of gold as the world’s investors as a whole, you would allocate 1.3% of your investment portfolio to it.
Anything much above that is more than an act of faith; it is a leap in the dark. Not even gold’s glitter can change that.

I arrived in Potosi, Bolivia a few years ago, on my 30th birthday. It is the highest city in the world and most visitors suffer from massive altitude sickness. I had to walk a couple blocks from the bus station to my hotel at midnight, but each step was killing me. I was weezing and dizzy, each breath rustling like dried leaves in my chest. There were no street lights, and a collection of mangy dogs trotting near the ditch. Suddenly, this old man, weathered like the hull of a wooden boat, came out of the shadows limping. He must have been 80. He started following me, moving slow, but faster than I could walk. He caught up with me and pushed me to the ground, my heart pounding, i couldn't even lift myself up. He snatched my wallet out of my pocket, lifted up my back pack and walked off into the shadows. I was mugged by an 80 year old man without a knife.

What a beautiful thing, just to be able to donate a million dollars. If bitcoin was regulated by the SEC (they vet investors) Roger Ver would never have been able to get in, never made money, and never donated this money. Roger Ver's donation &amp; savvy investing is a major denouncement of the 'favor the rich' laws of the SEC. Great stuff Roger.

First depending on how you set your inputs, bitcoin might not be able to rise exponentially for the next two years (there's not enough currency in the world for it to suck up). Second, are you saying you don't extrapolate on anything? So nothing you will do tomorrow will be based off of information in your the past? Hmmm. I doubt it. What you are really saying is that sometimes extrapolation is wrong. And if that's the case I agree. But to reduce my prediction to a one word response 'extrapolation' is like drawing a funny cartoon about Newton and saying 'gravity' as if gravity really is a stupid idea. Extrapolation is the only scientific tool we have for future consideration, and it is because you are extrapolating, you wake up without fear of a T-Rex in your bedroom ready to eat you.

From the video description: "Starting January 1st 2014 we can pull the plug. Let's finish what the Occupy Wall Street movement started. If everyone puts dollar a day into bitcoin or other alternative currency, even gold, Wall Street will leak and bleed. As the bitcoin economy increases/improves, we can add more and more. From this, a new economy will rise. By September 17th 2015 we can have all money out and Wall Street will be empty. Vacated.
Bitcoin is for real. It is not a company. It is a revolution that anyone can join. It is owned &amp; controlled by no one. Bitcoin is all of us. We are the 99%."

understand the rise people.

What GeoRedd is suggesting (and seems a likely reality) is that bitcoin is not going to stop here at $1000 per bitcoin. None of the models I've seen suggest a $1,000 price point either. Remember, bitcoin's great for many things, but stability is not one of them.
Instead, most insiders believe that bitcoin has two possible futures, one where it is worth zero, so something causes it to collapse, but the other future is full blown, grabbing enormous chucks of many markets and valued at well over a few trillion dollars. Which means that if you buy fifty dollars of bitcoin today, under this second scenario, those fifty will multiply many times over, just as the OPs original money did.

Its embarrassing to read such an article from the New York Times. This clear dismissal of an incendiary collection of inventions (bitcoin) ignores dozens of scholarly papers (yes bitcoin is now a fruitful area for PhD research) highlighting bitcoin's seismic changes to the world of finance. Bitcoin isn't poised to just take on gold (the author poo poos gold's 9 trillion dollar market), it also offers a complete overhaul of the 500 Billion (per year) remittance market. But perhaps the clincher is that with low transaction fees, quick confirmations and no chargebacks, bitcoin could toss Paypal, Square, Dwolla, MasterCard and Visa into Sorkin's faddish dustbin. People really do think with their pockets and saving money never goes out of style. Clearly Sorkin studies bitcoin by surfing youtube and chatting on twitter, because bitcoin's adopters and proponents are programmers, VCs and many recent millionaires who prefer to talk about 'colored coins' ability to replace all of Wall Street (yes everything they do) with a protocol. If only bitcoin could chide NYTs editors for being overly permissive as well.

1. Very interested.

3. Are big bets really feasible in a Reddit/Bitcoin space between anonymous parties? Even even via blockchain based escrows? Or are we stuck with finding a trusted 3rd party (the antithesis of bitcoin)
4. I could see myself defaulting and running to Xian China if the price came to 45k or more.

On sweaty day in July of 2009, Bergen St. Station on the L-Train (NY), a guy with an english accent who called himself Satoshi?

I smiled at him and said I don't charge for gum. But he insisted. I gave him a couple sticks of Sweet Mint &amp;  told him to hit me back later.

Anything that gets big and rich gets conservative, stiff and controlling. Apple's fall into this sad pattern hurts me personally. Remember the Apple Co. of 1984, shocking the world with this [ad]( during the Super-Bowl. As a life-long Apple fan, I've watched the company achieve new financial heights and sink to new spiritual lows. Is this transition a law of physics? It appears to be. The bigger you get, the less flexible you are. The higher you fly, the more afraid of falling you become. Fuck Apple, okay. And they do suck right now. But there's a take home here. This path should be a lesson to both the Bitcoin community and individuals who are becoming FILTHY rich by juggling bitcoins. Just in the last few weeks I've seen this Reddit spit fire at altcoins, noob users, and other exuberant yet funky ideas. The conservatism of hardcore Bitcoin redditors (especially during a rough week price-wise) was painful to watch. Bitcoin is amoral, and will thrive despite us. Bitcoin will pass $10,000 in the near future. But Bitcoin isn't the problem. Bitcoin doesn't care. Instead, we are moral...we are sentient...lets steer this ship into a place where new ideas can flourish. Sorry for the grandiose blathering here...but bitcoin is a big deal, and this planet may soon need our help. Let's hope to be cooler with our success than suck-wad Apple has been.

I'm assuming your 'extrapolation' bit is sarcastic and i see the humor. Yet all humans do today, is based on extrapolating from yesterday, including believing that tomorrow we won't be eaten by werewolves. All relationships are based on past data projected forward, but when your wife dumps you as you're holding champagne on your anniversary, you see the problems with relying exclusively on past data. Still extrapolation is the only scientific approach to looking at the future. Anything else is just shamanship. Perhaps you are a shaman? We do have to defend our trade.
