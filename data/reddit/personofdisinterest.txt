[X] Posted a circle jerk article with such amateurish writing that it sounded like it was composed in some kid's basement
[X] Didn't seem to notice that the comments to the article that were actually well thought out actually refuted the article
[X] Can't be bothered to defend your points and must resort to an ad hominem attack 
[X] Have already demonstrated you don't know what "liquidity" is in a thread about economics
[X] Seem to think the BEST way to promote bitcoin as a currency is to absolutely NOT use it as a currency.
[X] Will have trouble pushing you points of view until you learn about vetting sources and providing constructive argument for your ideas
@_date: 2015-06-12 16:00:55
If you understood economics you'd understand that 100% hoarding = 0 liquidity.

The best thing a person can do for bitcoin is offer a unique good or service that people want to purchase and only allow them to purchase it in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 23:36:27
That's great and all but you still butchered the understanding of what liquidity is. 
Scarcity and the perceived confidence of others both have value but try this thought experiment: you are an outsider and have heard of a new currency, but you are living fine from day to day without changing anything.  Which of these two scenarios would make you more likely to dabble in this currency?:
1. There is something you REALLY want to buy and the only way to get is it is to pay with the new currency.
2. Despite you not really needing it for any particular reason, a bunch of other people random people have some and aren't doing anything with it.
Which scenario makes you NEED the currency today? Desired product you can only obtain with the currency? Or seeing that other people are not doing anything with it and are instead acting like cartoon dragons?

As a child, 8ish, I found an envelope full of quarters at a carwash once, around seven dollars. My mother said I should give it to the man working the counter, and even though it was a couple month's allowance I did it without argument because it was my mom and it was also the right thing to do. 
I remember feeling the loss of it even in my body when I turned it in and the whole time we washed our car. 
On the way out, I swallowed up enough courage to approach the clerk again and say "sir, what's your policy on who gets to keep it if no one claims it?" 
With a real smug look on his face he said "I couldn't tell you that." I immediately had a pretty great idea of his policy and I was heartbroken. I suppose it was a good lesson that the world could be dark for only 7 dollars. But gosh, I hated that guy, and never trusted people the same.

As others have mentioned, you can just put it in something sexy like diamonds or whatever.  
There are a lot of other fun things to think about though: what if it's tattooed on a third party that's hard to get to? What if part of it's the tattoo?  What about injected? What if someone has to die for you to get it out of them? Hell what if it's on a 3d printed kidney? What if it isn't a heist and the main character realizes that HE'S the guy who's got it in him.  That's got Jason Statham written all over it.
What if it's concealed in a "fun" type object instead? Maybe do something lighter and more in the tone of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. The mob shook someone down for their vig and all they got was this stupid coronet with a long number etched in it. TRASH. Now these bumbly Rosencrantz and Guildenstern type thugs have to run all over London getting it back. Surprise, they aren't the only parties interested.
Sure, a straight up heist thingy has promise, but you're right, the climax being a stolen piece of paper with a code (or to be honest even a diamond) isn't super interesting.  That's why you don't make it happen in act 3.  You have them do it in the middle of act two: "yay we've accomplished our goal" they all think.  But All are wrong.  Oh All, you were so so wrong.  
The paper wallet, or paper diamonds, or paper stegosaurus or whatever was a ruse, a false victory.  If we're smart, we make it their attempt to cash out, or open the wallet, or whatever, reveals themselves to their mark (or a second interested party that is using them as canaries in a coal mine). Now they've got their powerful opponents on their tale.  OH NO! But they fish themselves out of trouble eventually and discover the real secret.  Hopefully it's interesting: maybe it's a clever "the best security is in plain sight" idea.  Maybe it's something better. It probably is. It's just late for me and I'm running out of steam.
Anyway yeah you can make it sexy, or funny, or even charming. You can even make it a bad SNL chick movie "oh no I threw away/ebayed/pawned my boyfriend's ugly watch with an etching on it and now I have to get it back because I know what it is."
Anyway, I'd totally like to see a good bitcoin movie.  I thought about skinning one of my old scripts into a bitcoin idea, but as interested as I am in the subject, I know more about writing than bitcoin.
I'm definitely in the camp of you can't be afraid of making a few technical comprises to tell a good story, but I'd want whatever I wrote to be more technically sound than one of those "hey this kid's arm got in an accident and now he can throw 100mph and plays for the cubs" type movies.

Hey guys I'm totally a Ukranian freedom fighter so if you could send me all your bitcoins that'd be so great.  We'd have so much freedom around here. Like...a lot of it. And then everyone would just sing and give people cans of food and stuff.  
Also...I don't know if you're into this or anything...but I've invented this machine that makes motion, what's the word?, oh yeah perpetually. So if like that's your thing it'd be totally cool if I could have most or all of whatever money you're considering giving to well vetted charities in your area that  you already know definitely are doing what they say.
Anyway thanks for your time and go (your) bitcoin (s to me)!

People should be able to do a lot of things. The question is whether or not they are likely do do so.
The last clause of your statement comes off as a rather intolerant itself. It lumps together a rather large part of the global population many of whom with vastly different views from each other and labels them all as intolerant. 
My original post wasn't meant to advocate religious belief in general.  I was pointing out that individual congregations were an opportunity for common people to propose ideas and incubate them into larger movements. These sorts of platforms are important as checks and balances to top down government.  
@_date: 2015-05-21 16:21:58
I just feel like the last part of what you said lumps all religious people/institutions together whether they're practicing sharia law and cutting people up for stealing things, or they're just hippies in the woods that want to sing songs and play guitars. 
I always get prickly at super broad statements like that because it's a way to have a point of view about a lot of things in a diverse set without actually having to think about any of the things in the set. I get that we can't all have highly nuanced opinions about every thing every time because no person has the bandwidth for that. 
But if you're picking and choosing it might be better to just not say a thing about rather than try to come up with an all inclusive generality for like the 80% percent plus population of the world that has some sort of religious faith. I mean that's really hard to defend other than saying that it's your preconception and you like it.

Absolutely on Bitcoin. I'd suspect you'd be ahead of me in that realm though.

@_date: 2015-05-21 15:16:41
My point isn't to say that there are not other things/groups/ways set about doing good work.  The things you mentioned are great.  
But the organizational advantages churches have  over much of what you said is that it's a default weekly meeting for massive amounts of people often respect and happen to talk to each other. Ideas are much more viral in this sort of petri dish because you don't need people to buy in first just to hear about it.

Regardless how how much people dislike specific religions, churches are one of the few institutions where grass roots efforts can gain enough momentum to have actual impact verses giant federalized national institutions.  
Sometimes this power is used for bad things and that is unfortunate.  But the fewer ways there are for common people to get together and impact giant government, the worse off everyone but the heads of giant government will be.

It wasn't "unproductive investments" a military dictatorship overthrew the government. They needed money to maintain power.

Then why does US health care cost ridiculously more per capita than every other westernized nation?
You use the word "free" like people aren't paying taxes and people shouldn't get value out of those taxes. Personally I'd rather pay taxes for free 'health' care than the free military and the free trillions of dollars in crooked banking bail out I got. 
It's ok if you don't like socialism, by why is the issue you choose to rail against one of the few uses of that tax money that would actually benefit the tax payers?
