This is a good argument for local crypocurrencies.

That was perfect, thank you.

Does anyone know where I could find one of those articles about the internet being a hive of pirates and pornos? ?

Google chrome is a monster, lol. Depends on how many tabs, the size / action on the page, and what other programs you have running. With 20 suspended I can open the wiki to check something while playing kerbal space program on my $250 laptop. 8gb ram

Same result for ["btc"]( as "BTC"

Yeah, just let that comment stand in the forum you chose to announce how awesome the thing is. Go ahead. Makes it look like everything is going great. /s

Also works in Bing browser searches. Not google.

yeah... you can judge me. I use an extension called The Great Suspender to stop it from hogging RAM and I cull them when I get reading time.

I hear about a lot of possible bitcoin-related services that require a public identity to be verified. Insurance is one. Why bother keeping your own bitcoin wallet hosted and secret if the public code will be attached to your name? Have someone else handle the security and benefit from the ease of use.

Subreddit or Reddit rules? I assume you mean site-wide rules since PMs are not governed by sub moderation. [You can check for yourself]( there is no section which says one cannot send out as many obnoxious or vote-gathering *personal messages* as one might wish.

Manual dial-tone operation for network interaction. The man has amazing range.

It is probably a hack they feel secure (in bluffing?) will infect any device with the base OS.

I think the job he has done at displaying the ease at which ignores Core's problems is remarkable.

I have downvoted your comment because even though you had the chance for a sensible and open dialogue you chose to skewer and insult - which is precisely against the spirit of the quote you shared.

checked my htc rezound and found squat. Lucky you!

For what, exactly? Honest question.

Incompatibility is the ultimate DoS, at least BU is honest about it by calling for a hard fork. Core is trying to hide this little detail.

You have been made a mod of [or one of these](
@_date: 2016-02-09 16:30:40
I'm on board with that.
@_date: 2016-02-09 15:39:25
Because *only* elected politicians make politically corrupt choices...
@_date: 2016-02-09 16:09:25
Or maybe we don't need to control to monetary supply because the only reason to do so is to exert control against other countries, trade zones, and our own citizens.

Bang for bit

He probably found the oldest law firm in the Western world and charged them with revealing in time that the trove of bitcoins will be split with whoever can bring him back.

Whose chair is chosen by the president of the US.
If I form a company and grant that honor to the president, do you think it will work?

The market for laundering off-chain coins would be interesting.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:43:45
If it splits the network in twain (the chance is there) instead of fighting over the name Bitcoin do both halves become altcoins? Are there now multiple "Bitcoins?"
@_date: 2016-07-12 13:10:54
Isn't there an argument to be made that Bitcoin could not handle that demand? The amount of transactions would create an issue?
If so, has anyone proposed using local cryptocurrencies for local trade?
