The ship is sinking.  The life boats are all gone.  The dance band is playing in the main hall and there may be some shrimp left.

My theory is that as people became more "gluten aware" they were starting to identify sore guts from other causes and from gluten intolerances created by non-genetic predisposition.
My two favourite food-chain "most likely" contributors;
* Sulfur/sulphites and other preservative/colour enhancing additives.   Gut tolerance for sulfur products is hitting all-time lows because we are using it in excess on all of our produce to eradicate disease instead of supporting the health of the plant to avoid disease (biodynamic principles).  Also used for meats to preserve and redden.
* Herbicides.   More and more research is pointing at previously-considered-safe herbicides like round-up becoming active against gut bacteria having negative effects on peoples ability to process things like gluten.  An interesting side-note is that there is neuro-chemical production effected here too.

I sell bodies of beef in Australia 4-6 month sprout-fattened to perfection and cut-up to customer spec in a boutique beef business.  I've publicly accepted Bitcoin for a good while and had zero bitcoin purchases and have absolutely no problem with that.  
That said, any bitcoiners in southern Queensland want some beautiful bulk beef --- hit us up @     Bitcoin always welcome.  No other virts sorry.  
We deliver to the coast (Sunny, Brissy, Goldie) for free so give us a try.
Sorry for the hijack.

Old article.  I believe it was followed by a statement that this is Not Going to Happen for all of the obvious reasons mentioned elsewhere in this thread.
Australia is a failed nanny state that is misrepresented by its politicians who have all been sold to the highest bidding "lobbying" corporation.   The only reason this could ever happen is if there are politicians invested in crypto who stand to make big bux.
