•	Free:  Send Bitcoin without any significant fees; the software, wallets and apps are all free to the public.
•	Smart:  Bitcoin can be programmed to pay at a certain time and under certain conditions and can never be “double-charged” or charged-back.
•	Accountable: Bitcoin has nothing to hide, the protocol and all transactions are confirmed multiple times and listed on the open Blockchain.
•	Secure: Guards, insurance and guns not needed!  The Bitcoin network uses state-of-the-art cryptography to provide superior privacy protection.
•	Bank-free:  safely stored in a number of convenient, free and secure ways, no third-parties, like banks, ever get involved. That’s why Bitcoin is described as a “peer-to-peer” currency.
•	Mine-able: Anyone can mine Bitcoin with free, open source software and their own hardware.
•	Accessible:  The Bitcoin network has superior privacy protection, yet is accessible from any WiFi connection or mobile device, giving anyone access to wealth and savings.

I'd love to hear other peoples' opinions about this.  Are we becoming more anonymous--or less, with Bitcoin??

Great catch!  Said 300 times?  That should seal it!
