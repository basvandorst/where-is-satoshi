For anyone starting from scratch, run these commands:

Sorry these unpaid volunteers didn't have the time to implement the change you've been waiting for. Maybe you should try contributing yourself if you think you can do better.


Seriously? Look at the change log. There's a ton of new features &amp; fixes. Show some respect for OSS developers who donate their time:

It's a joke, in reference to a number of comments that occurred in this thread from last week:

You need the OpenCL headers to be installed.
Ubuntu/Debian solution: sudo apt-get install opencl-headers
Then make again.

Thanks for the tip!
What video card are you using, and how many MKey/s was it hashing?
I haven't personally tested oclvanitygen on AMD cards. Only Nvidia.

Great work so far, and good explanation.
@_date: 2014-01-10 23:33:43
I have recently tried you guys out, and had a good experience. Thanks!

OK... I don't have immediate access to an Ubuntu machine right now, so I spun up an Amazon EC2 micro instance with Ubuntu and managed to build oclvanitygen on a fresh installation of Ubuntu (13.10).
This was the full list of packages I needed: make gcc libssl-dev libpcre3-dev opencl-headers ocl-icd-dev ocl-icd-dbg
In your case, "ocl-icd-dbg" is probably the only one missing at this point.
Let me know if that works.

You're right about Chrome extensions, but the Blockchain app is a Chrome app (rather than an extension). It's actually compiled to a binary and the source cannot be viewed.

Thanks Mandrik.

Right... that's why they're offering free credit monitoring.
Also, it's Experian providing the service, not Target. So whether you trust Target or not has nothing to do with this service.
@_date: 2014-01-04 05:35:37
Looks like you're probably still missing the 'ocl-icd-dev' package. Try installing that.

Of course 5 BTC isn't too much... He means the number of people that have already been awarded is concerning.

Same. The idea of printing out paper wallets with a single button sounds awesome... But I know I'd never use it.

If you check out the link you'll see it's more than just a Pi.

What's the difference? Either way the net result is: You have no assets.

I'd also like to help out with Japanese.

Or do work, provide services, etc.
