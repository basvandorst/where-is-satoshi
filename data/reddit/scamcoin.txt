Not all day but a few hours per day for sure.

Just another day in the life of hackcoins, If you don't loose your money to wild speculation then someone will probably just steal them from you anyway.

Bitcoins are crashing, Why the fuck would you be buying right now?
Bitcoin is going to back to it's price before the last pump, $300
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:06:05
Ah another apples and oranges response, How amusing...
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:20:00
Why would i want to sell Bitcoins on an exchange? So i have something else to file on my taxes at the end of the year? 
NO thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:06:18
I guess i am trolling this sub pretty hardcore, But i feel compelled to warn people Bitcoin is a scam.
It's a scam because it's being advertised as a currency, It is not a currency and it can never be a currency.
Using Bitcoin as money is like trying to use a share of stock as money. Actually come to think of it most stocks are more stable than Bitcoin is so technically using shares of stock as currency would make more sense.
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:10:23
I disagree, I believe another system is possible.
Read this article, It's very informative even though it does seem to promote Bitcoin for some odd reason.
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:40:42
And then the lag time for transactions will probably be days.

The glass was a metaphor for the finite space that is the earth, The water is a metaphor for monetary based systems that require infinite growth to survive.
You can only pour so much water into a glass, And don't start spewing that colonize mars bullshit, It took us probably 100 years just to put a silly little billion dollar RC toy car on mars so colonization and terraforming won't be possible for probably another 200 years.
We don't have 200 more years of buying and selling and destroying the environment to make more useless "Goods" to buy and sell.
This system is comming to an end one way or another.
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:29:34
As someone that has been in bitcoin since 2011 i can tell you this is just another pump, I remember when bitcoin hit $200 people where saying the same shit "Bitcoin is going to change the world" blah blah blah. Then it crashed a few weeks later.
You need to understand that there is no logical reason why bitcoin should be worth anything at all, It's speculation, Bitcoin has no utility and no real function. For money to have value it has to have utility and it has to be liquid and for most common (non computer nerds) people to understand it needs to be something physical they can hold in their hands.
Also it needs to have stability, This is where bitcoin is fundamentally flawed, It's treated more like a stock than a currency so it's basically more volatile than a fire in a meth lab.
@_date: 2013-11-24 15:49:11
Bitcoin's value is purely speculative.
It's literraly just a bunch of people buying and selling based speculation, Anyone that thinks 1 Bitcoin is really worth $800 is an idiot.

Seriously dude use your brain don't be swindled by this propaganda, This video looks like it was professionally made in a studio somewhere with paid actors, They are not out to bring truth to you they are trying to sell you something, The video is like an advertisement.
Bitcoin and fiat currency are both the same thing, They are both money, It's not the fact that USD is created and controlled by a central bank that makes you a slave to it, It's the fact that it makes you a slave because it's money.
Money = slavery.
Switching from USD to Bitcoin is just exchanging one form of enslavement for another.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:31:08
Bitcoin is not suitable as a medium of exchange, Too much volatility, Just by accepting it as payment you are taking a gamble on it either increasing or decreasing in value.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:09:12
Hmm i guess it didn't go through...
+butt tip $8 Butts verify
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:37:07
Probably just came to their senses and realized how pointless bitcoins are.
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:38:58
Oh god if it gets that high a lot of people are really going to get hurt, Some might even get completely wiped out.
Might even see people throwing themselves out of windows again.
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:54:31
Everyone jumping on the buttcoin bandwagon just so they can be part of the big pump and dump. Sad.
But that's the nature of the capitalist mindset, If you can convince people a turd is worth something you will have people trying to sell their own feces by the end of the day.
@_date: 2013-11-24 16:03:52
I wish, Peter Schiff is so rich he probably wipes his ass with money.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:17:57
Just send your money to me, I will hold it for you until you need and i will only charge you $20 per month to hold it.
Either way you take a gamble but at least with me you don't have to fool with buttchains and wild value fluctuations.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:04:32
I think it's more or less justified, After all gold has acutal uses in the physical world, Bitcoin only exists in the digital world and it's value is only speculative, I won't deny that bitcoins technology is very good at beaming money to people overseas with little fees but the speculative and volatile nature of Bitcoin renders it completely USELESS as a medium of exchange.
Just because there are Bitcoin ATM's popping up doesn't mean it is being accepted as a medium of exchange by the general public, The only people using it as such are people in the Bitcoin circlejerk.
It's gambling plain and simple, Instead of Bitcoin ATM's they should be making Bitcoin slot machines because it would be basically the same thing.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:55:36
Yea bitcoin is no savior, It's no cyberchrist, In the end it will be just another tool to subjugate the have nots.
Investing in Bitcoin now is like trying to invest in Apple stock after it peaked.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:59:49
Planet earth = finite space 
Monetary systems require infinite never ending growth to survive, That model doesn't work to well in finite space.
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:40:43
Your damn right a crash is coming, Just look back in time when bitcoin hit a record high of $200 - $230ish then crashed almost immediately afterwards, Hopefully this time when it crashed people will see that it's just gambling and has no real use and thus no real value.
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:58:00
And that also sums up the stability with bitcoin, It's like a rollercoaster, Good luck using that as a "Real time" medium of exchange.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:19:37
Oh god you're delusional.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:21:43
Bitcoin will never be stable. Never.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:26:18
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:06:00
Never said Buttcoin peaked, What i was saying was it's too expensive now for the average joe to make any money "investing" (Gambling) in it.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:56:26
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:52:29
Anyone throwing money into Bitcoin is just gambling with it, You might as well just take your money to vegas and spend it on slots and hookers.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:08:55
How many uButts go into an mButt anyway?
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:17:29
Too late.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:50:37
The volatility, There is no way it could ever be used as a medium of exchange unless it reaches a long term period of stability.
It's like if USD was to jump and crash in value everyday it would be completely useless as a medium of exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:17:15
Very artsy fartsy, Are these paid actors? 
Money debases everything, Even people, Money IS slavery and as long as it exists people will always be debased by it and be made slaves to it, And whoever has the most of it will control and ultimately subjugate those that have less of it.
This is the nature of monetary based systems and societies.
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:20:20
I'm not sure i agree, To me it just seems that Crypto-currencies are just a failed attempt to make an already flawed and broken monetary based system continue to function.
Sort of how medical treatment can marginally extend a terminally ill patients life by a few years, Inevitably the patient dies.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:17:27
Most of the posts on this sub are trolls, They have no real way to promote bitcoin so they have to make up stories to get other poor shmucks on the buttcoin bandwagon.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:50:34
I will say this about Bitcoin, If it can/does ever level off and reach stability (which i doubt it ever will) then It would probably be a nice replacement for western union and paypal, But even then i wouldn't trust it to completely replace USD.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:35:09


But that's sort of comparing apples to oranges, Gold isn't a currency it's a precious metal, The function of Bitcoin is to be a currency when in fact it is more of a stock than a currency.
While gold isn't a very good store of value anymore Bitcoin is an even worse store of value due to it's volatility.


They don't need to because they can just use cash which is tangible, And technically because of debit cards they can hold their entire bank accounts in their hands.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:37:16
It's more like buttmania really, It's like if i had a bag full of worthless rocks from my driveway and sold them online for $800.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:21:21
The bigger the bubble the faster it falls, I'm sure people that have a lot of money in Bitcoin are just sitting around starring at screens and charts all day with their finger on the trigger waiting to dump at a moments notice.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:54:00
Because this whole sub is just a big pro-bitcoin circlejerk.
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:50:57
When you put your money into paypal you don't have to worry about it losing it's value overnight.
The issue here is stability.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:14:52
It will end up "Costing" 100 times more but it won't be "Worth" anything at all.
Just like now it's about $839 per Bitcoin but i wouldn't give you a dollar for a bitcoin, Why? Because it's not worth anything to me, I have no use for it, I don't know anyone that lives abroad.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:06:06
Yea but that's not the point anyway, Everyone knows paypal/ebay is a shit monopoly that needs to die.
The point here again is value stability.
If i deposit $100 in my bank today i don't have to keep calling my bank every 10 minutes to find out if my money has lost or gained in value.
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:29:07
It's another bubble, The only thing different this time is the bubble has gotten really big.
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:22:15

The buttcoin lost almost half it's value in 3 days flat, Ouch! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:15:31
It won't.
But you can make a litle money on it if you get out before the pop.
Trust me, Medium of exchange it is not.
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:16:03
The only outcome of infinite growth capitalism is collapse.
Don't believe me? Take a glass and fill it full of water, If you don't stop pouring it will eventually overflow.
This is why monetary based systems will all inevitably fail.
