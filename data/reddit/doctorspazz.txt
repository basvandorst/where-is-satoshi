Looks to me like $50 CAD

Thank you. 
Do you have any advice on how to use it as newcomer? Basically I invested a bit with Coinbase but there is no way to pull out from there. I would love way to buy and transfer to my wallet when coinbase is down.
Any help is much appreciated.

Does this work in Canada and if so can someone explain the process? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:24:35
Hmmm maybe. Although my transaction shows price / btc in CAD I imagined the purchase value would also be CAD

Not so much man. I bought 250 CAN and it’s showing 197 or so.

Quadrigacx. Only.

Is it easy to transfer your BTC to a cold wallet from there? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:34:30
My question exactly 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:57:44
Quadrigacx

Before it started it’s massive increase the nearly 20 K it was sitting at 10.8 which means that we probably could see a correction all the way down to it starting point followed by a rapid increase in value or they could dip to where it has been fluctuating now and then skyrocket or they could do something we can’t predict it all

Are you sure you can’t sell on coinbase from Canada ?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:44:45
Does anyone have any input on Canadian methods of purchasing and eventually selling BTC?

Why not transfer it to GDAX and then to QuadrigaCX? Or CoinBase to GDAX and then to an offline wallet? You could have avoided all fees this way. Did they charge you bitcoin or cash for the fee?
