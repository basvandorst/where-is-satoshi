So they are bringing nothing back for no one. A miner with very little to no chance of profiting anything unless over very long period. Their "regular" gets you more power for less money.
Obvious ploy to bring in funds, must be losing money or lacking growth since halving.

..but just imagine..:
1. A proper staff to handle at least the average load of initial customer service tickets
2. A smaller specialized staff to handle at least the average load of very technical and expensive customer service tickets that are forwarded from the regular customer services tickets due to specific rules (i.e. amount of money involved, bug related, bank related, KYC related)
3. A proper queue system that gives people a spot in a line that is automatically updated as they move up in line , info e-mailed to users at set intervals, because sometimes logging in is the problem.
These 3 things alone are the only things that can actually do away with these "get it solved on reddit" issues. They should be totally expected overhead costs when starting up these bitcoin related biz... and coinbase.. after existing for quite a while and with so much investment money and also money made through fees... this should all be simply built into their standard way of doing business. There are no exceptions, this is just the type of customer service that is REQUIRED. Its part of beginning to work as an actual business... you just work this way instead of the wrong way.
There shouldn't be so many squeaky wheels is what I'm saying I guess. Coinbase can get this all in order very quickly if they cared.

not true... if you had the same amount of inputs then the fee would be $7 if you transferred $1 or $10,000,000
understanding how fees work helps you not to freak out when you are surprised by how much the fee ends up being.

If it was built into the basic functionality that the person opening a channel can open it as a "publicly funded channel"... once there is a public channel opened by one user, other users could then search for these channels and add funds to them freely. If the channel is then used by people for payments, the fees could easily be broken down by percentage automatically. 
It doesn't have to be some contract based thing, its more like specific wallet function..like muti-sig but not. The incentive to use this or that channel could be volume based, where channels that have larger amounts of funds would be used by those people who need to send large sums of money on the lightning network... if it's only small amount, then smaller channels could be used. This makes it so large companies would not necessarily be the only ones who could afford to make large volume channels. 
I'm just riffing here.. but I see a future for "pooled-anything" with blockchain tech.
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:30:55
I get you but basically the resources and risk of keeping a large channel open will make it harder for one entity to risk this all themselves .. if they are making profit enough  then it would be the same incentive for everyone to do the same .. yes those with more money will be able to make higher volume channels but that is just a fact of the matter.. I’ve heard of possibilities of pooled publically funded channels that can use coins of many to build a larger channel than even one company could ever make or find it reasonable to make vs cost.

when GoX was imploding one COULD NOT withdraw fiat NOR bitcoins by the end 
@_date: 2016-04-18 04:28:59
Darknet to me implies no identity... Therefore a legal exchange that deals with fiat is useless on the darknet other than maybe for security reasons but I would imagine there are speed issues that would make an exchange through Tor be super painful and useless.. Unless of course it's for anonymity and is therefore illegal as it could not comply with proper regulatory practices...
So we're already dealing an illegal premise to begin with ... But .. It COULD work with a lot of trust and a lot of rep building 
Trade happen as usual off chain on the website like all exchanges.. ...  This Can this be done with multisig when it comes to all the crypto deposits to give users a lil security  .. For fiat deposits it would have to be cash in the mail.. Or gift cards or accounts on websites with value or prepaid cards or anything that the exchange could implement/have a system to receive)... Really not sure how the exchange would handle their central address unless they own an island or something like that
And withdrawal by ....CASH in the mail...(or gift cards? Or prepaid visas ?)  (up to you to deal with anonymity of mailing addresses like Silk Road people did with their mail) .. Yaya I know ...
And so on..
The exchange could invite " pay out services" that handle secretive secure mailing of cash for a fee and maybe the user chooses based on reputation like you would choose ups or fedex..whenever you make w withdrawal 
..There can also be a trustable-ish (by reputation) third party escrow like or community authority service .. many of them ..that work on rep that can hold a key to the multisig and /or deal with disputes between the exchange and the users.. For a fee of course 
Cash in the mail is not too cool but it's the darknet people!
There now you have a darknet exchange. Go code it.
Oh yeah and since is the darknet make sure you introduce something to allow for an exit scam into the code

Hello Linda's! 
I've been here and paid with Bitcoin. They used the umm I think bitpay app on an iPhone.
It was very seemless as these things usually go.
Aruba is a lovely tiny island off the coast of Venezuela. Amazing climate. Amazing beaches. Eagle beach is my favourite place on earth so far. It's quite popular and well known but doesn't feel touristy to me. It's got a European flavour very unique I think..
As far as I know Linda's was the only food place there that accepted Bitcoin as payment. I need to go Bitcoin touring.
On the the Dutch pancakes. These were amazing and had me wishing I loaded my phone with more coin and wish I went for breakfast everyday. Went on my last day after a long day of snorkelling at Boca Catalina.
First off my gf eats vegan and gluten free (yes she is actually in need of this diet for medical reasons she's not just one of those people you hate... Well unless you hate vegetarians because the no meat thing is choice ) .. But So ya it's really tough to go out to eat anywhere which is why we love Aruba as there's lots of good older hotels that are more like apartments with stove tops and we cook for ourselves .. She would starve at an all inclusive or eat and be sick the whole time. None the less a place like Linda's is a gem for us. Again a pity we didn't get to go again. Maybe In a couple of years! 
So she had a gluten free vegan Dutch pancake with tomatoes on it... (Kinda like a crepe
Pizza ...it's not like an American pancake.. But can be served that way soft of like a dessert ... But these are More like a thin fried savoury crepe with tomatoes cooked right into it.. ) It was delicious (I sampled it)and she ate it like it was her last meal.. I had the Gouda tomato regular person pancake and it was also so awesomely good  super cheesy and perfectly cooked 
 
Great friendly service and a pretty quaint bar inside with a nice patio. 
It's a little bit of a walk from palm beach but the walk will stir up your hunger. Or grab a cab like everyone else in Aruba.
My post has very little to do with anything especially bitcoin but I'm reliving a moment here.. Bear with me..

how are (fiat) withdrawals handled?
@_date: 2018-01-25 05:20:00
With lightning network, can users crowdfund a channel and keep it open while making interest on the amount they have invested in the channel from fees of users using the channel? Seems this  would make keeping open and maintaining high volume channels would be easier.. and would be an easy way to cure the ol’ “oh but you have pay to open a channel” rhetoric while allowing “investors” in the channel to benefit off the fees generated 
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:42:23
The actual details of the Lightning network can show you how it is not a very centralized network. Look into how it works. It costs the amount of a regular transaction to start a channel. Even if fees are 20-30$ it’s still very easy for nearly anyone to open a channel. If I then use that channel and other people I know use that channel .. none of us are rich or powerful but we can easily use our channel for our purposes.
I mean really it’s centralized if centralized companies make it impossible for this to occur. But the Lightning network itself makes mainnet transactions cheaper to begin with with.
Just because you haven’t seen something that proves the opposite doesn’t mean that there isn’t something that completely proves the opposite .. just in the way it operates.

read the comments, OP compared it to gold. You cannot use gold to buy coffee.. You can only move a lot of gold or it's barely worth it. I guess it's comparable to selling your ring for cash then using that cash knowing you paid a fee.. I still feel that would be more of a rip off knowing no one can give you a very clear indication of how much your ring is worth nor do you have so many rings.

I wont bother to point out the inconsistencies and nonsense you have spewed in just a few lines, speaking so matter of fact about a coin that has a dumbass dictator spouting shit all over the world making his coin look terrible.. all the while no real development nor proper future has been set in place. Bitcoin has a plan.. "off chain" is not the evil you think it is. Also, I probably own more bcash than most since i will not be selling mine (why would i take my bitcoins out of cold storage to take advantage of such small shitty gains) ... Bcash has made little to no effort at making themselves look smart. The look like a bunch of babies. The proof is SO out there. Roger has not said one word EVER that made me want to trust money with him, every speech is cringe worthy..every tweet is BS.... AND YES you are trusting him to not dump his billions in bcash when it best suits him. Maybe the network he is building is seemingly decentralized but his wealth makes him the oozing center of shit.

He is a bullshitter. Made people believe mt gox was solvent when it wasn’t by releasing an obvious shill video for them saying “everything is fine” probably in bid to get his coins out.. behind the scenes.. he gets all emo when you call it Bcash even when you don’t know that is an issue... he’s a baby. He cries about how amazing bitcoin is for the world (literally cries) yet he would rather dilute the entire idea by creating a clone shitcoin that does nothing but inflated the market and fools newbies into fucking up transaction..

just like your money does when you send around a couple hundred million in gold. armored trucks, armed guards, fuel etc. Bitcoin, 15-20 fee to get it there basically instantly or usually within the hour no matter the amount. $5-$10 if you don't mind waiting a few hours. Much less if you use segwit. But ya this guy is a bit premature unless he has lots and knows a few good merchants.

I'm not completely content but solutions are coming and also it's maybe not necessary in my daily life to have small bitcoin transactions.  Also segwit fees are already less than that but large institutions refuse to implement a simple upgrade because their execs are invested in these "cheaper faster transactions" in other coins.

The main evidence that you choose to ignore is the manipulation happening currently at coinbase.. the insider trading, the BCH pump along with the LACK OF SEGWIT.. how does segwit help if people do not implement it? So basically.. without getting technical I told you how BTC is being held back and transaction fees are being pumped by shit criminal entities like coinbase..I told you that I was not responding to you about specifics and I ranted about why it is generally a stupid thing and the people involved are stupid. So I didn't show you evidence because it is there for you .. look into the ACTUAL lightning network. You can fucking use it. You can fucking test it. Go ahead show how it is more centralized that a bunch of miners being given full control. You are going to need to grow up and accept that BCH, whether or not it is a good idea, doesn't have the backbone to be trusted.. With bitcoin I don't have to trust anyone that is the beauty. True open source. 
Like I said the profit is insignificant to me in selling my BCH. I wouldn't want to do reveal my cold storage to the IRS (if i were to cash out the BCH they can look into and assume a lot about the BTC) Also, I don't think things are so bad on either side technically the politics from the BCH crowd and the rhetoric has just been pathetic.. The blocksize rhetoric is not as monumental as you think... people are using it as a canary in the mine rather than coming up with solutions together. if you don't see this you are being manipulated. Why not make an amazing one coin instead of making the current alt-coin crypto-community such a fucking shit show? Because of greed greed greed. If you don't like the current bitcoin, fucking get on the code and change it for the better then get people on that node version.. There is your new, better bitcoin. Creating a whole new chain is a sign of a scam, a sign you couldn't go about it the way that everyone else is willing to, either because of weak programming or an idea that no one really cares about or that solves nothing. Have all major exchanges &amp; retailers implement segwit and get people to properly send fees with better wallet software that isn't politically written to pump their altcoin fav...... Sorry bcash was not the better path, i rely on code not on people.

Maybe it should be on the main window when you make a transaction? Like "you are sending x btc + the regular fee that you are usualy sending and including this other fee for us"
This way there's no way for people to complain they didn't know they were doing it because it's "buried" in the terms and conditions or wherever.
Honestly I use multibit and had no idea that I was supporting you. I actually like that I am supporting you but I guess I'd rather have it very upfront and tied to my actual transactions and how they add up.

Again you are wrong totally. You do not need to trust anyone.
If you want insured bitcoins you can use coinbase.. but I prefer to set things up for myself.. Insurance is unnecessary with proper use of bitcoin/cold storage...
Again look up cold storage. You just aren't getting the point of Eric's post, nor the point of bitcoin. There is no unproven company to trust. You just don't get it if you think that. But thats OK because you can read up and learn. 
edit: 
You are missing the point again that bitcoins do not have to be stored offsite nor on your computer… there are many ways to protect your coins to be point of being completely backed up securely with only those you personally trust (talking family here not necessarily companies) all over the world.
Furthermore, what makes you think that Bitcoin companies are never going to be insured? In that case your points are totally void. (Again, coinbase is insured)

It is definitely harder but there are some "funny" differences to think about.. Firstly all your peers and society will definitely "support" your decision to get off those drugs… there are support groups and stuff but its those everyday reminders from friends and family that can really help you keep those things outta your mind. 
As a user, your entire social sphere is usually using unless you do it in secret. Therefore you usually become "the enemy" to your user friends because now you are against them somehow… And if you are only battling yourself to quit, in secret, well ...I can be my own worst enemy.

PGP is absolutely one of the simplest things I've ever learned to use. If you can use bitcoin, you can use easily grasp PGP. Especially if you are on a Mac or Windoze machine (if you are concerned about the difficulty of PGP i'll assume you are using one of these OSs)
On a mac gpgtools even integrates with OSx Mail if you want to just encrypt every email that goes out, you can do that pretty easily. A few clicks.
I dunno about the rest of your comment, but I just have to respond to comments like PGP is a pain.

You don't understand cold storage. 
There is no throwing it under your mattress.. This is what you have to do with cash.. not bitcoin. 
Paper wallets can be stored in vaults around the world if you wanted that sort of security. 
They can also just be with your close friends and family around the world.
Or you can memorize phrases that are used to recover you bitcoins with certain methods.. Those phrases written and encrypted by you on paper/electronics/in your wallet… Not insured.. But in this case you have taken care of the problem with your own mind and your ability to keep track of things and share that info with those you love and trust.
Or you can leave everything up to you. And yes i trust me more than I trust a bank or insurance company. It is a major issue that this isn't the case with most people.

Context was a long conversation about this trial and that I was trying to say this is keeping innocent addicts off the street, out of dangerous situations and keeping money out of the hands of the drug cartels in some situations…. she was trying to say that regardless of the "positive" you may think this brought to the world, they are enabling drug users and she thinks that is worse that actually doing the drugs.. and obviously she thinks pretty low of drug users.… I mean she has a pretty standard viewpoint, but its frustrating none the less.
@_date: 2015-05-09 15:26:26
I dunno man. It seems like this type of prob may be more system related. Maybe you need to refresh your system. Get a clean boot going.. 
The program crashing your system has nothing to do with pgp specifically and if pretty much MOST people had no prob installing and running the app on their system. It's unfortunately probably your system.
Have you ever gotten to the point where you could actually encrypt or decrypt some text or something?
The app could definitely be buggy too but I would assume it would be a common prob if so.

I wasn't talking about how good OSx mail was or anything like that.. I was talking about how easy PGP is.. and it's easy… and some one who uses "all the OSs" like you do should have no trouble with it. 
Furthermore it is as simple as cutting and pasting from a text editor into google/apple mail or whatever your flavour if you don't integrate with a mail app.
 
If you're talking about "mom and pop"  then if "mom and pop" wanna use windows or Mac Mail they can if they want and its still pretty freaking easy to do. Kind of like installing any other app.
I specifically said PGP is easy to use to disagree with you on that specific point. So get serious about reading a comment i guess?

What would be that warm fuzzy thing you used to tell people? That you have a functional crypto-currency and it works though it has scaling issues as all tech does? 
Or that the price didn't go up to $5K like you thought it would after you bought 21 btc at $900 in 2013? 
 Where does the butt hurt come from? 
 Do you really think that a bunch of complaining reddit peeps  have any real power at all?   Do you think that any of the fundamentals of the technology have actually changed in any drastic way to make you think that anything has actually changed in the last couple years? 
 Other than the block size debate and all the babies that complain and cry about the price here ..nothing has changed. All of your feelings are within you...  They don't have an external source ..  It's growing and growing not fizzling out the tech is expanding the infrastructure is expanding absolutely nothing but the price has fluctuated ..  
 It's amazing to see the rhetoric spit out around here without any source or any kind of detail ..  And it's all from people to complain about the sub not having proper information and proper contributors "like it used to" 
Luv u Reddit !

There are many things wrong with your logic in this comment to point out. Not trying to be a dick, just helping out. Here are 2 things:
1. The interesting thing that he is trying to point out is that the protocol has not been hacked, meaning bitcoin has never been hacked… It has not. Its sort of funny to say because of how many times we have heard on Fox News that "BITCOIN HAS BEEN HACKED AGAIN!" .. But yes as Eric says ..it has not ever been hacked. If any of the bitcoin/crypto companies or whatever that have been hacked were using actual bitcoin protocol, there would have never been a hack, but also most of their services would be pointless.
2. You do not "secure it on your own in your own computer". There a bunch of different ways to avoid loosing everything in a fire or a theft, or a failed hard drive.. etc... Look up cold storage which is just one way.
Anyways thats all I have time for.

You have made a lot of assumptions about me
I am fine with that. I was asking you questions looking for the reasons for the butt hurt that was being described.
I don't agree wth you
But I was actually looking for reasons for your butthurt 
You describe something about he community you don't like but mostly it seems like you don't like the kiddies on reddit 
Again nothing I said wasn't true and no I didn't say "Bitcoin will not fail ever"
I said its growing and growing and hasn't really stopped though the price has fluctuated ... That which has changed must be what you don't like right?
For someone that bought in 2009 and has made some great profit and also has contributed to the network with mining you would think that you would at least know how unimportant this Sub really is and how the tech has not changed and how the infrastructure has only grown.
Yes it can all turn around tomorrow but there is nothing that has really changed since the beginning other than maybe this sub 
(yes I've watched Bitcoin since 2010 but only an idiot would tell anyone how much money in any way he holds on Reddit) hopefully u don't mean you own 2.5k btc cause you just told everyone hacking and attacking  you is well worth it. Be careful!  I am in no way a criminal this is a real fucking warning dude.

Because alcohol is pretty easy to make, all out of non-illegal, mostly agricultural substances, its really engrained in society, the economy, and most histories of humans.

You don't listen nor do you read on anything I have mentioned.
I'm glad you like insurance. Itll probably be easy for them to convince that when they lost all your money at the bank because some clerk mis handled your file and you can't get it back because they are at odds with their insurance company... That they did everything they could. You obviously have never had a bank randomly close on you stop access to your funds until they pay out their executives and their investors what they are owed.
If you still think that the proper way to store bitcoin would include the ability for you to make a simple mistake and loose all your bitcoins .. Again you are wrong you have not researched cold storage you have not researched multi-signature you have no idea that there are easy ways to prevent what you are saying is so easy for someone to do. It would be very difficult for me to mistakenly spend all my bitcoins. Even if I did loose some the most I could loose is 5-10% and that would be after making quite a few Steps in a particular order that I have pre planned totally by accident.
Forget it you won't look into it anyways. You don't have the backbone to do so because mom and dad have been handling your money your whole life .. Oh and math and reading  obviously scares the shit out of you 
Goodbye and enjoy your insurance and your banks while they still exist.

Ok .. So now your argument is simply distorting.
Sure Pgp is insecure. ok I won't argue that point and I assume most encryption is possible to bypass If you are the right individual.
So why start off your comments with "Pgp is too hard to use"?
That way we could save us some wierd convo on reddit where you sorta bash people for disagreeing with something extremely specific with what you said then come back later to say .. "Well the more important thing is.."
I hardly preached. I said it was easy to use after you preached that it was difficult. I gave a few small examples to support my claim. 
Think you should reread this if you intend on responding again as every comment you make discredits you further and further it seems.

Just make sure you always use a wallet that uses dynamic fees.. You end up paying a little more, but it gets you basically in on the next block. Electrum is the first easy to use wallet that comes to mind.
It sucks to pay higher fees but today I got instant confirmation with a 0.000113 btc fee...about 7cent US so I am not sure whats up.. your transaction is 10x the size of mine... 226 (bytes)(mine) vs 2110 (bytes)(yours)... maybe just required a bigger fee unfortunately!

I could only assume all the banks and commerce related businesses consume a much larger percentage if we include all electricity needs of sky scrapers, huge centralized networks in giant warehouses, call centres.. Including all the construction pollution/ waste to handle  growth .. It's just not the same as expanding basically only the warehouse based networks that do not depend on location for anything more than a good internet connection and cheapest electricity available. Also considering the network - though growing very powerful - is also growing much more efficient as time passes.. With no real way to understand how efficient it could become in the future.

Quite honestly this has nothing at all to do with bitcoin.
It has to do with the fact that you are dealing with a system of fees and bs because you are dealing with companies that need to profit off the buying and selling of bitcoin. Just like if you needed to buy some euro with your usd.
Do some work that earns you bitcoins. Ask to be paid in bitcoin and let your employer/contract deal with the fees. Then use those bitcoins somewhere that actually accepts bitcoins, and not through a payment processor.
That is true bitcoin and is not full of hidden costs everywhere. It's the dreamy future of a bitcoin holder. We aren't there yet, but being able to liquidate back into the economy by buying something immediately, just as you would buy with credit card, is going to be the most expensive way to spend your bitcoins, this is because credit cards put the cost of the merchant. There isn't any bitcoin payment processors that do that right now.
Also, bitpay uses an algorithm to determine it's bitcoin price based on daily averages (I believe.. or something like that) it's never going to match any one exchange rate exactly. Just as all exchanges usually are a few bucks off of each other.
I know it seems weird, but your not getting it if you think there are fees involved in bitcoin other than miner's fees. Its just not the reality. Companies require fees so that they can exist in a USD economy and sell bitcoins like a product.

Better to have a screen at the end that says.
"Visit Blockchain.info to sign up for an online bitcoin wallet and to read about all of our other bitcoin related services"
I believe companies that don't try to show this type of information in a very open and clear way are basically intentionally hiding it in hopes that people will associate their brand with being THE blockchain/bitcoin company. Sure its just good ol' business and branding tactics... but thats why it is shitty. Its an archaic approach which has only proven, over and over again, to only be as effective as it is detrimental. 
Oh... and regular people recognize stock video as stock video these days. Its not easy to fool people into thinking you didn't just purchase a bunch of videos with happy looking people in them and string it all together in final cut.

Also is the oil industry fuelled by production of synthetic fabrics or is it mainly used by shipping and automotive uses?

I doubt you're allergic to every oil alternative. But also.. I would be willing to admit there is still a need for an animal based clothing when it makes sense .. in areas where textiles are difficult to produce synthetically and the raw materials needed are pretty much a bi-product of the meat industry.. but i would say in America Scandinavia Europe and Russia (biggest winter markets?) there are ways to produce synthetics/natural alternatives for every need ... especially hypo-allergenic (keeping in mind you're probably a minority as I would assume most people with allergies would be allergic to furs and animal textiles over synthetics..

This is all noise.

Bitcoin works, that's the important part. Its not some gimmick, nor a tulip, its a technology. Decentralization is why it is important, valuable &amp; why it will survive.

Yes this... and I remember it was a very large difference. Imagine just the amount of people that work in those large skyscrapers downtown .. Most of them are banks and commerce.. Even if the entire buildings are not bank employees etc.. There is still a lot of energy in just heating and cooling that building ... It's huge numbers that are easily offset by huge profits so no one really worries about them. 
With Bitcoin here is a direct correlation between how much energy is used and how much profit you make mining... There is an incentive to be as efficient as possible beyond just environmental / altruistic concerns !  I believe this will be big factor in the future.

Energy companies should be mining bitcoin with their profits in the form of electricity... or somehow offering hardware for their clients in home. But who will produce the chips cheaper than china? I believe the only way to start this up is to do it at a loss. Maybe once some of the infrastructure is up and some of the regulations have been worked on then maybe some chip production can happen somewhere in north America. I think actual mining COULD happen in North America on a large scale ..especially with renewable sources being used.. but the actual chip production has so many variables and so many other leaders worldwide.

Newegg is not always reliable with shipping and communicating.

It works if people who use it are only those who make a mistake and require the speedier confirmation. I just left mine to confirm slowly because I knew I paid a substantial-ish fee and it would get in within my required window. But if I didn't include a fee at all it could have been really stuck. This tool would help.

I really did not believe any of this stuff but someone showed me a bunch of videos online that in the least were weird. All that bohemian grove stuff is strange. I don't exactly understand the point of the use of the occult and what that would do for overtaking world finance... Or whatever the "nwo" does.. But there does seem to be strange symbolism and ritual used .. To an extreme at times.  .... Again what it means is still ambiguous in my eyes. It's probably propaganda of some sort. Psychological experiments being run by social engineers... Or something like that.
 I think if you are a Christian the occult means Satan ... But that means you believe they actually have power by practicing occult rituals. 
I also think if you are not a Christian and you see these things you can still believe that their "black magic" is real... But that means you believe that magic exists.
When you put things this clearly .. Conspiracy people usually either say they are Christian (religion.. The acceptable delusion) or they sorta bow outta the conversation.. No one wants to admit they believe in magic unless they are regular Disney land goers.

In your cryptic way are you saying that electrum is no good at estimating a proper fee? I use it for small transactions with spending coin. Seemed convenient and used widely. Will always do this check in the future didn't know it was required these days. Assumed dynamic fees solved the issue.
@_date: 2016-12-07 23:32:07
I understand how fees work generally. I used dynamic fees thinking that this was the solution to the problem you have brought up. Unfortunately as someone else mentioned, this is not a be all end all solution and at time of back log the algorithm to pay the proper fee but not too much (dynamic fees ) sometimes fails and doesn't calculate enough for that time period. 
So I thought I used the proper solution but that solution is not perfect.

As any open source project does
People (anyone on earth on the net) can openly review the software and test it on their own and run it any ways they'd like and modify it any way they would like
If people like the software and think it is good and safe they use it. In a sense it's a system with non trust needed. Thus it is decentralized. The incentive to use Bitcoin .. to mine it or buy it or program it .. is because the tech is very unique and does something which no other system on earth (or at least it did it first and has the most security in hashpower) can do. This makes it valuable for the world therefore it gains in monetary value as well. Therefore in summery the incentive to work on Bitcoin and choose and run the best software that works for the best of the Eco system is that it gains value and if you take part in this Eco system rather than attacking it you can also take part in these gains. It's a selfish incentive and that is why it works. So how is it decided what will be merged? The software that works best will always be Bitcoin and be the most profitable... the entire world can test it to make sure it works before we implement it and we can implement at the moment we all want by consensus (running the software or not) .. it's the most fair way anything has ever run ever. Its actually quite an amazing thing.

It's not that people need to know you can buy a tiny amount... People need to know that the process is like any other currency exchange on earth. It's just like when you go to the bank or local exchange and you buy some money from another country for your vacation or whatever. You can exchange your country's currency for the currency Bitcoin. Just in this case banks do not do this service for you, they do not support it yet. Telling people you can buy tiny bits is not a full description, it doesn't tell people to think about it like their USD or whatever.. it tells them to think about Bitcoin like AAPL or some other popular stock... Bitcoin is not a stock, and has much more to do with being a currency than a stock. A stock is company.. Bitcoin is NOT a company.

No person should ever ask you give them a certain wedding present.

Next .. no person can tell you that you owe them money out of thin air... it really seems like they think they can easily fool you and I don't know why they have that impression... but by your reaction to this Reddit response it seems you are saying "geee I dunno I don't remember telling him anything about sharing my profits!?" Like no ! it's either it happened or it didn't .. your can't be rationalizing this .. it makes it seem like you DID tell him you would share your profits and I don't know why you would and yet STILL you would be in no way legally obligated to pay him anything ... but it's like you're trying to convince yourself of this.  ....

Ok thats true about Crackle!
My point about Netflix comment is more about it being difficult to be a similar service but not Netflix because Netflix is so common place that most publishers/production companies will still put their content there while I think a non-netflix service may have trouble getting Universal or Sony or etc… to allow their content to be accessible through a non-netflix service that runs on Bitcoin.
Further, in my comment I mentioned that I WOULD pay for Netflix with Bitcoin if I could do so in a very legit way like them accepting it directly into a wallet or directly through a payment processor

More importantly, places where one can buy Bitcoin like exchanges should have really good disclaimers that suck people into reading information before they do certain things. Coinbase should have a really big disclaimer explaining these types of things. The disclaimers can be kept updated and crypto signed to guarantee to the user that those conditions, as of a certain date and time, are just something one must deal with when buying and moving bitcoin. One must understand there is quite a big learning curve and there is no take backs.  Unfortunately it seems these large companies are quite involved in this political nonsense and might even see themselves benefiting by not informing people properly / honestly. It doesn't have to be doom &amp; gloom Bcash is bad.. just understand the ecosystem a bit and understand what you are doing when you are doing it should at least a bit of a concern of the exchange... it would only be the right thing to do and would help user which in turn helps bitcoin overall...would also make wallets and websites less of concern in the end.

If Adam Back says this is legit, it really makes me think I should get back into mining. It was fun. Also, watching my amount of Bitcoin slowly increase rather than just sit there was always such a joy. Of course I was paying for it, but now it's worth 1000x what I paid, and instead of dealing with a bank and exchange, I just paid my electrical bill as per usual. Makes bitcoin feel a lot less institutional when you are minting it in your back office, I imagine offsetting this with solar would be even more awesome these days.

So basically if he is super rich and doesn't care about his Bitcoin investment at all then he could basically take away a lot of the power of the network. I'm not really worried if this, if he had just hard forked it would be a similar scenario and people would then have to decide if BU or Bitcoin was more valuable. This could have affected Bitcoin but mostly people have figured that most value would split between the two chains and other than some disruption and maybe some FUD things could go one way eventually and things would be ok again ..hardly putting his investment at risk. But shutting down 70% of his hash rate just to shut down Bitcoin seems anti-profit from his prospective. He could just hardfork and reduce the risk of loosing all value to any crypto he is holding. The idea is the incentive of mining is profit.. Which is why a 51% attack is strange coming from someone who stands to gain so much if at least one chain continues to thrive. I guess this is where the whole PBOC connection conspiracy comes from. He could just be a state actor NOT making that profit and working with the PBOC to shut down or cripple Bitcoin using mining. It's all small change for the PBOC.

Mining is complex these days. You need dedicated hardware that is very expensive and makes it hard to get a ROI if you have even cheap electricity.. and you most likely need to connect to a mining pool to mine with any small amount of hashing power if you want to mine anything at all.
Thing is as you have said you are just trying to check it out and see what it's like .. well without thousands invested upfront almost any mining you do with your PC or cheap asic will still only produce such a small amount of power for the pool that you will never be able to reach the minimum payout amount that would allow you to withdraw your "mined" bitcoins from your mining pools web-based "wallet" that theoretically holds the Bitcoin you have "mined" .. truly you have not mined anything though. You will be contributing an infinitesimally small amount of power to a pool and will never even be able to "play" and "learn" other than on the pool website.
This is a different Bitcoin than 4/5 years ago.

That the movement leaders at BU do not care about Bitcoin nor the things they are bringing up against segwit.
They used altruism as a stance and now we see it was greed and hiding their advantage for as long as possible. Regular old scuzzy business tactics by generally scuzzy people willing to lie to millions of people just to maintain a tiny advantage. All the while slowing progress, shitting on peoples names, calling the deletion of fake news "censorship"...
There's probably a bit of everyone playing shitty roles but how can it not be seen as a total lie to further their advantage? If they truely wanted the advantages that bigger blocks bring then they would have worked with core directly.. they could have taken a very generous approach to showing everyone just how bigger blocks were better than segwit... but truly they don't care - if the advantage came to them through segwit.. then they would be willing to take advantage..
Makes me wonder what they would do if they truely had enough power to double spend or fuck the network for profit another way.

I don't have to tell you that of course that bitcoin is an idealist environment and we can only both imagine the future, we cannot know the future.

It is pure idoicy to believe mining is not more efficient than other services. It uses much less than even the amazon servers in America.
Get your head out of the Fud mud. As if bitcoin will not be upgraded and made more efficient over time just as it has before. You are blinded by your hate for freedom.
Edit: 51% attack would render the billions of potential dollars for those miners worthless. You are barking up a tree that has been barked at for years and it was ALWAYS FUD.

People are stupidly giving the ol don’t leave it on an exchange. Fucking design a decentralized exchange or shut up I fucking hate that argument. You keep the coins on the exchange if you are trading. Trading is gonna happen. Exchanges should be better .. period. Authorities should be better at understanding things .. period. Fuck anything else.
Also these coins should have just been auto distributed back to the users equally with everyone taking an equal percentage loss. 
Fuck anyone who says that would be too difficult.

Oh I see you don't get what I'm saying. Somehow you relate policing &amp; trade work with govt intervention and politics... somehow you think I'm saying that people will tolerate rape and child molestation just because the government would be a functional trade rather than a philosophical nightmare...You obviously do not understand how things work normally therefore it would be silly of me to continue this on the grounds that we are trying to evolve the systems of humanity with the evolution of our species. Ok I'll engage you on just this point alone : why would you think government is the only thing in the way of all the bad things you mentioned?

It's all pathetically handed over someone who then hands it over to "their" people... there's so much overhead .. so much fat .. so many uneeded middlemen.  Again "the people"(those who participate)  can handle this stuff themselves with a proper easy to use and access voting system that they can vote on things they care about with. It's simpler than the Orwellian view you are giving proper automated trustless government processes.

Big fish with two bitcoins? Are you calling me that? Your outburst is so unclear and hard to read. Sorry.
Anyways, no worries if thinking that makes you feel good. 
I have converted no more than 2% of my total Bitcoin ever into USD. 
If you think anything of what you said is a real world example of anything you have some research to do.
Bitcoin has value because people are speculating that, because of it's special features, that have never existed before, it may already be on it's way to dominating the transfer of value globally. It certainly no longer has much value in the dark markets if that's what you were referring to as "shady" .. or maybe you believed the fud that isis was buying and selling bitcoins and we were making them rich? 
The increase in overall value is not what makes Bitcoin powerful, it is the underlying tech, and the global super computer that the network creates, that makes this all worth something. As it becomes used more, it will have to hold enough value in it in order to be used as a replacement for more archaic and expensive global value transfer services (bank transfers &amp; money wiring). 
Therefore, maybe what you are seeing is less Bitcoin gaining value in US Dollars, but the USD, and all fiat, losing value to Bitcoin.
But also, the increase in value is not only a sign that people are still speculating on Bitcoin, and the overall consensus is somewhat positive, it also means that after quite a few years, no government has been able to stop it, no law has been able to limit it's overall growth, it's gowing hedge against the rest of the world's economy.
Time will tell and yes we are in the beginning stages, so what difference does anything you are saying make?
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:12:54
You don’t understand. The exchange price has absolutely nothing to do with the VALUE. Edit: your downvotes mean nothing what I have said is all that matters. Bitcoin is a technology that is unique and THAT alone is very rare also it replaces systems that have value currently and so it has value. The exchange rate is only a representation of how the rest of the worlds finances are losing ground to the first trustworthy money that has ever existed. Math before people. I don’t want my finances mixed up with people who can’t imagine something like bitcoin easily ... seamlessly replacing all personal banking...so now I don’t have to. Enjoy your banks!
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:35:07
Decimal places. Most people do no get their coins from mining them so people will get them where they already do.. people will sell you 0.0000001 bitcoin if it is worth something and they can sell it.
Also miners will still make money on transaction fees which we would assume to be much higher amounts at that point if more and more people are using it(even with very low per transaction fee) miners will still have to sell coin to pay for electricity or maybe buy it directly at that point .. either way revenue is lost, and coins are out back on the market or in someone else’s hands

I feel sometimes there is a need to look forward in order to motivate the work that it takes to get there. Sometimes the path isn't so clear, but focusing on the "final" or "future" design as a complete system can sometimes give us insight on the work it will take to get there. There's no harm in just investing, but there's also no harm in daydreaming about the future of your investment when your investment has granted you time to do so by growing as it has. Also, brainstorming is a very powerful tool used by all businesses, it doesn't hurt to try it out when attempting find a focus for your own efforts. Also... if Bitcoin did not already have such gifted developers, programmers &amp; hardware designers involved in the space, it wouldn't be worth as much as it is today.. sure it works without these people but it wouldn't work as well as it does and it might not be as efficient nor as secure. if you are able to work at their level then definitely there is no time like now to start programming the next few layers of Bitcoin functionality, but if you are like me, and your skills are specialized in something else, maybe those skills can be used to push Bitcoin forward in some other way, get it out there in ways that haven't yet been imagined. As a group we are focusing on the possibility of creating some sort of "emergency fund" functionality that can be built into any wallet so that portions of savings can be used easily quickly &amp; very covertly.. this emergency fund transaction could be triggered by a special web-app or hardware device allowing the user to send those emergency funds to a hot wallet like a cell phone wallet or exchange or a trusted person immediately ..without having to deal with getting to a computer or remembering a phrase or having access to private keys.. More secure than carrying around a regular wallet that already has some amount of Bitcoins in it.. it would be safer this way, to have access to larger amounts of Bitcoins, than carrying that large amount on you in person all the time... the transaction activation device can be anything like a ring or a hidden phone app or a text message or a phone call or really anything you can imagine.  The ways that we can use and secure our Bitcoins are endless so ..the more ways that become public and make the functionality of Bitcoin more friendly and forgiving while maintaining security the better
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:41:14
I mean I can think of a number better ways than leaving it on a exchange. 
In general the best/easiest way one can do this is by memorizing a 12 word seed for a wallet like electrum. Would be pretty easy in dire circumstances and works on any computer and also android I believe. 
Can just leave your computer behind .. enter your 12 words once a you are safe and voila.

Nah you miss the point. It means that money you have cannot be devalued by creating more. This means that if one bitcoin has a certain value no one can come along and print bitcoin and say oh well
Now it’s worth less than before. They would have to have enough to sell in order to devalue your coins. Therefore it means the currency can only spread and divide. It may not solve all economic problems on earth but it protects users against unlawful seizure, fully controlling public funds to bailout banks, and giving you the ability to be unbanked yet still have access to funds. This is why it was created.

It is not about fixing it but eliminating it's useless parts and replacing it with something that is functional, something that works for all humans (all humans are the same.. they want life security and communal decision making through a fair process.. and we do not integrate criminal behaviour or anti-life behaviour into the process)- Government should never attempt to fix the problems that government cannot fix and that is mostly what government does today. Why would we want many governments of many different types if ...as you say ...it cannot be fixed? Why would we want to continue down the same path we have been on for hundreds of years .. if not thousands ... if it has only brought us turmoil, war and instability all the while making the rich very much richer? What is the point of politics at all then? To just argue what should and should not be illegal over and over? NO! It is supposed to facilitate function! Why give these simple functions over to humans who are corruptible? A blockchain can handle taxes, insurance, contracts, charity, voting, security etc etc etc.. what else do you want your government to be concerned with ? Abortion? Homosexuality? Race relations? World Policing?   You've got your blinders set to waaay too narrow, as someone who believes in Bitcoin as a financial system, it should be easy for you to see what is necessary.. eliminate the humans that fuck everything up, make the system trustless. Get government out of philosophical discussions and religion. Get them out of interfering with life.

You misunderstand. Just because they provide employment doesn’t mean they aren’t fundamentally flawed and are extremely much less efficient to the point where these wonderful jobs they create are actually costing us so much more at every level. Trillions.  These jobs can be replaced with better jobs .. Just like the idiotic coal industry. Banks are archaic nonsense with no place in a modern efficient non-fraudulent world. If Andreas says what he says it’s fine because again it’s all much less wasted energy than any form of banking system in existence.

The Bulgarian thing wasn't illegal seizure. It was just regular old seizure... No one can take away your  bitcoin if you don't give it to them if you know how to store them properly. There is nothing that has ever compromised this fact. So no, a police officer cannot come in and take your bitcoins like they can take your cash and freeze your accounts. If you do something illegal and you go to jail, if they manage to get your bitcoins for some reason its because you gave them up or you did something that was not secure. Again, there is no compromise here. It's just fact. I never said that deflation was a good thing, I said Bitcoin works the  way it does to secure its users from interruption by the state. This is a good thing. Deflationary /inflationary problems stemming from a poorly run economic system, overly dependent on insurance, fees, and completely susceptible to corruption by nearly anyone involved at any level is something that bitcoin helps protect the user from. Yes, exchanges can be made illegal, buying and selling and holding, purchasing... all can be made illegal.. Just like the joint I am smoking right now... and yet so many people smoke pot  that the government is just deciding "fuck it legalize it" at this point.  How did all these people continue to grow, sell &amp; live off marijuana profits while their product was completely illegal? They just fucking did because it's a product that people want. People want money that is safe from their state, people want a backup, they want their own insurance that they get to control. Fuck your country, inflation/deflation and all the problems that bad actors and corrupt states create. Bitcoin is freedom, if it was widely used, the problems you speak of would magically go away because the money we waste on financial systems, completely unnecessary archaic systems that are nothing but systems of overhead and fraud at this point would free up so much money, we could actually invest in a fruitful future together, instead of paying for the coke addicted investment banker who fucked up an entire country's economy by making fucked risky investments cause they are so high. Honestly if you think that the problems that may come if people are hoarding bitcoin are worse than the situation we are in now, its because you benefit too much off this corrupt system and should probably evaluate your choices in life, and what you do with your time and comfort. See how far corruption reaches into your daily comfort and how many people have to suffer world wide just so your ass can be comfortably in a lazy boy watching tv all night. Its actually a devastating number of people. Directly tied to yours and mine personal comforts. Bitcoin aims to remove these problems from the world. Devalue banks and corruption, and we have a whole new world of possibilities.

Again law, logic &amp; science can all still exist if the financial systems of government are automated and made trustless and open ...  you are giving government credit in areas they do not have any control over ..  you are talking about potential problems / current problems that are unrelated to what I'm talking about ..
We're still talking about money and corruption here.. we can let the healthcare professionals make decisions on where money goes but atleast we can insure the money gets there in a clear and fair process .. then the debate can begin over where the money goes.. atleast we know when they do make those decisions the money wlll flow openly for all to see the destination ....
Yea it's hard to decide who gets health care but really as long as there is as much money as possible there - the most amount of help can be done..
Again you're being shortsited not really lookin at the same thing here. I'm talking about automating the processes of money flow and giving it back to the people .. those people are free to think and choose for themselves where the money goes .. this allows cultures to still be different .. allowing you to take part in what you want while being able avoid all the needless overhead. People will still be able to debate over abortion or health care or religion or homosexuality till they are blue in their stupid faces .. they could just actually participate in a real way this way... and at least the money will be clear and fairly distributed.

Why would it go away? the problem is it is always held back by a heavy handed, dysfunctional, bloated, expensive government system full of rich elites and spinsters, and the only reason they have power is because we choose to give it to them.. Are you saying these government systems create the diversity in culture that exists? I certainly do not agree with that.

The ones that grant the most freedoms i guess ... but ALL government is corruptible..it is handled by humans.. As I said I am not talking about the things that people do day to day or the loss of culture.. or which is best or worse.. I am talking about how these governments..all of them .. use money .. treat money.. that is not just theirs, but is public money. In this way we are all the same. We want our government to do the same things with public money. We want security, education.. many things.. but we do not want money taken or lost because of silly needless things. If they were more accountable and the processes that handled the money were automated and transparent, then the same countries could exist with the same things that are great about them.. but the public would be richer because there would be less lost for needless things.. Maybe people could be happier and healthier since most of the people across this earth are barely compensated for the labour they put into society... and the government makes 100s of percent more money for doing essentially nothing, and usually they are essentially for facilitating corruption. Yes! Globally it is more common for a government to be corrupt than not.. to suffer great losses of public funds to corrupt men in high places. Bitcoin driven contracts acting as government promises are much more secure.

Wish I was better at redditing and i could respond to your reply more directly..
- your first point about banks is not as wide eyed as it needs to be to see the effect bitcoin could have on banks. But yes you are correct about loans and the other special services that banks provide like mortgages.. I had mentioned this in my paragraph..maybe a little too loosely. But also I think a lightning based network that handles things like specialized contracts, investments &amp; loans could be made much more transparent, and those who want to be trusted would be transparent. I'm not sure I fully understood what you were saying about inflation/deflation you point seems to cut off. One thing about Bitcoin is that government cannot go and make more Bitcoins...so that is a good thing, value can never be taken away by the government choosing to unload some of the value of you savings into their spending.
- If the banks were truly as your description states.. "...collection of nations savings..." then why do they make SO much profit? If the money goes to other things that's great but they really do not need to make billions in profit. They are the only ones legally allowed to do this work.. it is a type of monopoly, and Bitcoin makes the security they give basically obsolete. Bitcoin can be insured too! Banks just have tons of fraud insurance they don't even care to be fully secure nor to hire honest / be honest ... they're covered! Bitcoin is secure before the bank touches it. 
- Bitcoin is basically a world state.
- For you last comment I would only say if the tech is open-source and somehow secured by the Bitcoin network I am sure it would be more trust-worthy than any paper based democratic process imaginable. I really don't think there has ever been one...
- how about one vote per retina scan hash? Or one vote per DNA sequence 
- I really do think the cryptographic democratic process could be nothing short of the closest thing to UN-manipulable we've ever had .

you don’t understand that if the police cannot access your bitcoin they cannot access your bitcoins ... period....and they can ask you and complain and Say a million things but they can never make you give up your coins and also unless they have documented proof they can never even know you have them. This is the power of bitcoin and having another option.. a true alternative economy. Sure they have value and can be seized but what if the police cannot access them
Or do not know you have them??
I understand deflation you don’t understand bitcoin nor why it exists. I’m saying remove problematic things in this world that limit people and the problems of deflation do not arise. You are missing the point we avoid the problem entirely by creating and using this currency. 
Why would people hoard when they can use it? Or when they neeeeed to use it. Why would no one need to to use it if they had it and it had value and they had nothing else?? Why would this situation across the entire world not exist? It’s a very narrow vision.
If people are being killed for using it ...OF COURSE it is being held back don’t be ignorant.. this could cause value fluctuations and yes hoarding .... but if people can use it freely why would people not spend if they had it and needed to spend it for food and living.. why could it NEVER retain value AND be used? Especially if it was a true transfer of value and not a political tool.
Honestly you sound pretty closed minded and not seeing the full potential of a incorruptible global currency .. nor the full effect of a undeniably completely corrupt global political and economic system..

No one has really tackled this before.. so hey give me a bit of time to work out the entirety of the automated one world functional programmed digital government.. but maybe its an algorithm based on need vs. amounts available. Input the data, the algorithm decides the amounts ...  OR maybe people fund the things they would like with a multisig type of thing where there are funds that are tied up as taxes but they get to choose the destination. The idea/hope is, without humans and the corruption we would actually be able to afford things like proper social service, national security, health care, insurance and infrastructure etc...  think of the billions upon billions saved every year on overhead alone, then think of the the billions saved from fraud &amp; other criminal activity.. voting can be handled by the blockchain therefore we can possibly vote more on smaller things all together in an easier, much more secure way. There can still be government, but one that facilitates the automated nature of the open-source government layer. Police, military, security, NuBanks, Cryptobanks, art, culture, personal freedom can all exist in this environment. The incentives for any type of work would still be there, we are not talking about robots overtaking every aspect of our labour-lives (though this could actually happen in some way rather soon.. crypto would also be a great way of dealing with welfare or universal basic income).. i know it sounds idyllic.. BUT you've got to think of it from the perspective that this is a computer program, for the first time we could consider all of the functions of government and try to automate all of the actions needed to perform these functions with the least amount of user input. We can work on these programs until they are PERFECT or as close to perfect as possible.. That will be government layer 1.0.. if you run the latest accpetable software you can acccess the network and participate, if you stay on outdated software you cannot connect/participate. This is all within the realm of human comprehension and ability at this point I believe. I think government intentionally create a complex idea of itself out of simple the simple issues it takes on in order to validate it's own existence. Can you possibly imagine the amount of money that has been spent on the legalizing marijuana debate? Incredible amounts of time, resources &amp; money. Why not present some evidence that is peer reviewed online by verifiable experts, and on an open network have people vote if they want these things legalized on not.. debate over immediately. I can imagine thousands of these types of philosophical debates that ring on and on in governments all over the world as giant money vacuums..  bloated and overflowing with money from every security hole &amp; corruptible human access point.

I didn't say capitalism created borders I said it's short sighted thinking this way. ... you've literally proved my point that it is very archaic thinking that humans came up with before civilization.. they are imaginary .. like gods.
If humans take one moment to realize where they are in this universe .. not only in location but also in time .. well.. it would be easy for them to see their delusions of difference and borders. China seemed insular to you because you are one who believes Chinese people are fundamentally different than you. I am saying they are not.. they operate as their environment allows.. they evolved this way..
 one govt with a decentralized currency basically means govt becomes a trade job that handles tasks and never philosophizes... the basis of this govt would be "there is only one way that humanity can operate .. openly &amp; freely.. otherwise there is manipulation and communication breakdown.

It's fine, I wasn't too busy I usually reddit while I'm commuting.
"The people" is anyone who wants to participate, don't try to over-complicate what I'm saying by trying to put a negative spin on ALL co-operative effort.... you say.." everyone is pretty shit" but I'M the immature one. 
Yes! the people are owed what they put in and they don't deserve to have a lot of their contribution to society blown on overpriced trips around the world on private jets and long winded years-long debates over psuedo-philosophical questions that do not have a true universal answer nor a place in government at all. No "the people" are not lazy and dysfunctional ..but they be manipulated, tired and overworked... as I said "the people" are those who participate .. the ones that "run a node" if you will.  I have been working in banking / IT for 15 years and I recently have started working on some bitcoin related freelance jobs.. I am 36 .. i have a sweet little family.. so .. I hope you are over 75! Enjoy your great world where everyone is so different, but all sooo fat and lazy that they need government to whip them out of bed and get in line for their welfare check ..even if its way more expensive and less secure to run things that way!

It is not discrimination.. It is lawful resolution.

Was she justified in doing and saying the things you have said? i say yes. She is fighting in an evil world and after all the investigating I've done its trump's background and shady business tactics that are not trustworthy. 
I believe you are too influenced by the hype and have not done any critical thinking about the situations your are even generally bringing up. 
If you disagree and think she is "guilty" .. Well I disagree with you. I believe she is in a real position of having to decide which of the 2 evils is best for Americans. Trump is in a position for himself ... He's anywhere he is for his brand and his money.
Furthermore your credibility is very much compromised when you say that religion is not race therefore hating on religions is not "RACIST".. Ok it is stupid.. Ignorant... Not smart.. Not conscious... Gorilla type thinking... I'm trying to come up with terms that will make sense you to.
Telling people that is like telling people you are racist. It's really that simple. 
Trump is unqualified and hasn't said a bright thing this entire election... He is going for the lowest common denominator vote (like all racist dictators have done in the past)
Your chart may not be wrong but it is irrelevant as intent and purpose are not included in the list...and your interpretation of said list is so backwards since it is literally saying that Trump has no experience. 
What happens when he'll have to start a war?
Those check marks are going to fill up fast once he's in office.. And since he is a "hater" of many things.. Do you think he will not close down media establishments that are biased against him? He's the first presidential nominee ever to ban people (media outlets) from his rallies.. It's just one step beyond what he has already done..
I mean...based on your interpretations I guess hitler wasn't a racist.. He was just anti Jewish (huge difference dude...just huge. /s)

If someone wanted to murder me in my home I don't think my Windows and locks will stop them from getting in. These are deterants for petty crime.

Big sigh.

Why are the Muslims I know personally for abortion and gay marriage? My Christian grandma sure isn't.
It's because there are circumstances that represent all cases all possibilities .. we build a country with hopes that humans are good and then we create provisions to ensure those that break the law are deterred or punished. 
It is still illegal for a shop keeper to keep high school students out of his shop just because he knows some shop lifters are young kids.

 So they aren't Muslims they are good people that escaped a terrible place and came here and contributed to your country and you're willing to say that their paedophiles because of a religion that they no longer fully practice  because they came from an area where a small group of people are insane enough or criminal enough to be terrorist 
religion is dead.you base your ideas on simple things when you start to think about your personal religion as being true and good.  Most modern people are not religious.   Even in those countries you can ask people if you had an opem enough mind. 
Based on this alSo I guess that means that 90% of the Christians in America aren't Christians because they don't follow the Bible at all.. many couldn't tell you where Canada is do you think they can interpret A book from 2000 years ago ?   That is where religion is at today ...even when people are identified as a particular religion because of a family tie or place they come from they still may not be  practising that religion at all .. they may not believe one thing about it.. or maybe even hate it like I hate Christianity for all of it's bullshit.. The church is an absolute joke for simple people 
at least I got you to finally admit that you hate muslims you think that they're pathetic  and that a group of billions of people..  are all the same and a threat to your personal freedom in America ..   and you are extremely worried they might steal your cell phone 
That's all I thought about you from the moment that you started posting at least I was right about you.  You think that religion is black-and-white like everything else in this world meanwhile you yourself are so many different hype machines rolled into one you can't even put together a proper argument against the fact that all you care about is getting rid of brown people from your little white country.  Its seeps out eventually. 
It's not going to happen I'm sorry to tell you. legislation will not pass that stops people from entering this country even if Trump becomes president. He's lying you twit.. he is there to make his business grow..it seems that he may be even trying to get into politics so that he can avoid all of the problems that he has with his business currently and possibly legislate himself out of bankruptcy or tax evasion/fraud ..He's gathering votes like anyone else in his position . when's the last time you saw a major change come from a presidential candidate no matter how much bullshit they spoke before about how they're going to change things .  if you say Ronald Ragan ill fucking laugh. if you mention one of the war mongers from World War II ill fucking laugh
 Realize you are an out dated ancient idea that will die off eventually. The world will be the colour brown faster than you imagine...racial mixing is the only end to this mess of arrogance and borders.   If you think that anyone or any words will stand in the way of that ...  your worst nightmare began a long time ago when life first came to this earth most likely by means of strange mutations of self replicating proteins not any deity.

Honestly I like the idea of Bitcoin being used for this purpose, but I think the hope of using Bitcoin in this way would require somehow creating a system which takes the risks away from the buyers/investors. In a way, all the other regular crowd funding websites are full of fraudulent activity. A lot of companies not living up to the hype they've created over their campaign, and usually with a flashy Pro edited video, they have a large amount of investors. Then when they do not deliver everyone tries to either dispute the transaction with PayPal or their Visa. Sometimes it works out and you get your money back, sometimes you lose money. It depends on the details of your case. 
obviously the seller needs to be protected, for similar but opposite sided reasons. Don't want unwarranted charge backs /disputes.
So really what Bitcoin needs is trusted companies with good reputations implementing the most open code they can without compromising user's funds. I don't see any other way other than the eBay or Amazon model where reputation plays a big role. If you as a company can create an amazingly open and fair escrow system with a multi-sig wallet, and YOU somehow are able to convince people to trust you, and with time and fair practices that you are basically as trustworthy as amazon, or PayPal or eBay or bitpay or coinbase or a number of other big name companies in this type of space, I can see this working. But as we all know those companies have a their own problems. 
In a sense by going the direction that you are going you have created an even more lucrative space for scammers than regular crowd source sites, which themselves are already full of scammers. You take away any ability for people to get their money back. You make it actually more profitable to not bother with creating the product in the end.. Even if you intended to do so in the first place. In a sense it's easier to trust YOU as a very open and central entity than it is to trust hundreds or (I'm sure you are hoping) thousands of individual "companies" and in their anonymity.

From your linked Christian article:
There appears to be some disagreement within the Muslim community about whether the practice is tied to their faith.
Sheik Yousef Al Badri, of Al Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt, addressed the issue in a film called "Honor Diaries," a documentary about abuses against women such as FGM, forced marriage and honor killings.
"Circumcision is the reason why Muslim women are virtuous, unlike Western women who run after their sexual appetite in any place with any man," he says in the film.
Elsewhere in the documentary, Dr. Qanta Ahmed, a physician and the author of In The Land of Invisible Women, says, "Female genital mutilation is not advocated in Islam in any way, shape or form.  It doesn't appear in the Koran, but has very much been adopted by some Muslim societies." 
My response:
So it is a contentious issue and some think it's a crime. Like many other things in this world.
You cant latch on to simple things like this. Islam and ALL other religions are smorgasbords of nonsense shady history and full of HATRED

Ok sure
Most are shitty places run by religious idiots.
But American intervention in these places has not helped .  Some say it is the root cause of the unrest in the Middle East currently. and many many individuals have moved from those places during these last few years because they know they can be free and live free here and believe what they want freely and have fully integrated and become beneficial members of our community.
Oil is a problem and west's desires for it are problematic.
Americans being irrational and starting irrational wars based on lies (ie George bushs wmd debacle ) destabilized and allows criminals opportunities they didn't have before.
Religion is a tool of control over the masses. In American Christians that this county has religious values but what truly makes this place great is acting with thought and fact and ignoring religious "whining" when it is important to do so. Separation of church and state. That is what works. 
Making a few Criminals who stole an oil field from indigenous people rich due to our American greed is not the way to go about helping middle eastern countries 
How do I differentiate between Muslims who are practicing and those who are just born into a Muslim family? I am a Christian as I have stated but I think Christianity is a stupid thing and I have never believed it.  I believe in abortion and gay marriage ...Will you group me with other Christians?

Ok so due to your limited little world and a circumstantial experience you had once.. all immigrants are bad.
Blanket statements.
I also figured you would hate on my for being a student. fact is I am educated and I care about people and I can see how silly basing your views of all immigrants on these tiny experiences you have had. 
I've been more articulate in my arguments explained myself fully and mentioned all the things you keep bringing up over and over again.
Also ignoring things Ive already said completely.
It's the tactic of someone who thinks they've been wronged. But you have not. You have suffered the consequences of living in a fair and just society where people are given the benefit of the doubt when evidence shows only tiny fractions of ALL Groups are problematic ..and making huge generalizations based on personal experiences is just silly. I have many Muslim friends at school with parents who are Muslim immigrants first generation . Even some who came after 9/11.  In fact i have worked entire summers for one such family at their print shop doing graphic design, webdesign and accounting. Helped them when they were being shit on at a bank .. acted as their official rep and got them what they needed cause I am white of course.
You see your scope is small ... I know mine is small too therefore in need more than jus give circumstantial personal experience.  I need facts . Cold hard facts .. not feeling

Ok let me answer it and patronize you so that you will feel good.
There is a difference.  
When I am keeping my home locked I am locking out the potential for someone who is a criminal to steal my things. 
When I block out people for being a part of a group I am blocking potential innocent people who the country could benefit from. 
So it's that simple. Your argument is that simple to just dismantle and I have already answer similar arguments that are just as simplistic and pointless and misguided as this earlier in the conversation which is why I didn't bother.
Go on please

Isn't there a coin that is pegged to the USD?
I believe that the sentiments here are that it is a "shitcoin"
But, I think on an exchange like this one, it could be the way one could trade between USD&lt;-&gt;BTC . It could represent US fiat, then one could just exchange that locally without worry of volatility in the meantime. Could even get a few coins pegged to different currencies if there isn't yet a coin for that. Or maybe they are exchanged for local currency at the same rate as USD.
Almost like withdrawing money from an exchange to your bank account.. i know there is an extra step to sell locally somehow but it could even potentially be faster than withdraws if the pegged coin was easy to exchange locally.
This would definitely allow those with large trading positions to trade without worry of an exchange collapse, all the while being able to easily keep a "fiat" balance that is volatility free… 
Not sure if this is possible or has already been mentioned before. Just pondering..ing...

This is all so cyclic. 
'Discrimination" against a criminal is not discrimination... It is due process. They are arrested .. Judged and put in jail.
There is no discussion if this is a discriminatory process. 
If you feel that scientologists are criminals and had evidence and I am sure in a court of law it would be determined Ok for you to not hire a baby sitter who is a scientologist.
You have religious freedom in this country and if you can prove that it is against your religion or your values to hire a Satan worshipper.. Same as above.

Bombs going off weekly? Your numbers are not based on facts but fear tactics. Rhetoric.
You obviously have not looked into immigration in this and other countries. If you think that the only way these people will come to this country is on the individual backs of Americans.. U are horribly mistaken. There are institutions managing these things so that we can continue contributing to the country in the ways that we can as individuals... Not necessarily by h0using Syrian families in my fucking dorm. So full of rhetoric and hype. You are literally reading me headlines.

A bank that handles Bitcoin properly would be a good bank. A bank that currently does not exist. Even Bitcoin exchanges do not handle Bitcoin properly giving you tokens instead of actual Bitcoin causing a bottleneck on withdrawals of Bitcoin. Bitcoin undermines all current banking but that doesnt mean there won't be a chance for good banks even proper crypto based banks to exist and give incentives through investment opportunities and interest.
The guy is not crazy he sees banks as middle man to everyone's money.. even the state. That is crazy when there is truely no need for it and these banks become more rich than anyone else in the chain of money lending and fees...The middle man doesn't need to exist with Bitcoin...
You're both right

The stupidity of the coverage of this debate will spin this into "bitcoin companies split up Bitcoin and future more uncertain than ever" ... all the while this news is sort of good. 
Still there is something childish and non-scientific going on with all of this. It should be obvious which technology is best since we have a test net. We can test what the outcome will be in many different scenarios, many more than come up with any regularity, and we can see which way works best. No one should have an opinion, whatever way works best should be implemented without question
Definition of best: (most secure balanced with quickest, most useful abilities).... it really shouldn't even be a debate at all.
tldr Kill the debate, contentious forks are dumb, use science, experiment.  but whatever. I'm never reading one more thing about block sizes or this stupid debate. I'm done. I'll be out hoarding coins on the beach. See ya.

That's not what he's saying. He's furthering your comment beyond where you have taken it...and said that everyone can be a victim, not just Bitcoin users. Therefore this is not a bitcoin issue, it's an issue for anything of value.
Furthermore, what makes you think that you need to carry all or even a lot of Bitcoin on your person, even when in public and you are using Bitcoin? There are so many ways to avoid this. It just takes a little more planning and thoughtful spending.

I think bitcoiners like the idea that control is mostly/truly in their hands if used properly. 
If the loss of Bitcoin is due to your own misunderstanding/poor choices, it's because it was Bitcoin that brought you control and freedom to make that mistake.
It's a double edged sword and Bitcoin believers have already chosen the side they want by embracing Bitcoin. Some people can be harsh in general so getting the "ok it was your fault anyways.. Bitcoin not affected.." answer is to be expected. People expressing any personal loss on the Internet have met the same exact type of criticism.. 
"Oh you trusted you money with that investor? That's your own fault then.."  
Humans who use Bitcoin are no different than other humans.
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:33:38
You misunderstand. I am saying those who truly embrace Bitcoin are those who educate themselves fully and wouldnt lose their bitcoins to a simple phishing email or the other thousands of ways someone can scam you. They use the true features of Bitcoin and secure them "with the laws of the physical universe" or whatever protecting them.
Bitcoin works and doesn't care about how you use it. That is why it is powerful. widespread use/acceptance is not necessary for Bitcoins true success. 
You were also saying you didn't like the whole "well it's your own fault attitude" and I'm saying that's just jerks being jerks. Same with any other internet people.

ETC currently sits about 15-20% of the hashing power and it took some time to get there.  What the previous commenter is trying to tell you is that those numbers are not enough to get a second chain going in a functional way(with bitcoin's slower block creation)  The slow build of mining The "classic" chain would have made those first days of mining the second chain completely unprofitable.. With potential to never become profitable. 
Ethereum is built differently therefore this can happen with Ethereum much easier than Bitcoin. (...If the miners acted in a similar to the eth miners after the fork. )

It is a great tech with a lot of potential but investing is either a shot in the dark because you believe in something or you have inside info. No one here had inside info therefore any guess is a shot in the dark. I am myself investing only tiny amounts of what I can afford to lose that way I never run into huge losses .. many many people have lost a lot of money investing in something they don't fully understand .. also the expontial increase that has occurred already is possible to happen again but requires Bitcoin to become a MAJOR world wide tech that many legitimate business / economies  can use... for this guy the actual increase of the overall market cap during the period that he had bitcoins was a expontially smaller number ...

You can expect a centralized Currency like ETH to do very well in a world where there are central banks that still dominate the economy.  Bitcoin is the more powerful player in this situation .. also to compare the prices between a centralized and decentralized coin is pointless to compare ..disconnected and not related at all.  It is mutable and therefore just like every other system available today except the coin and a few other decentralized currencies

PSA to all Bitcoin companies. When you don't respond to a customer until the post on Reddit it makes you look ..
Well let just say quite pathetic. 
 If you let problems like this happen(lack of communication) No matter if the person is at fault and are doing illegal things or whatever...they need to be in the loop at least with progress updates because they then make you look stupid for responding to a tattletale and "public" criticism.. and because you then put aside all your rules of business just to stop some stupid rumour type shit on reddit. 
Lets atleast ACT like a professional company (Even if you're  not.)
Btw.. if it is a kyc-type thing then the customer should at least get a nice "unofficial" notice that it is the case .. I don't care it's not technically allowed  under The US or whatever version of the law ..I have been winked winked multiple times in other business when it was a govt/kyc  thing holding up my funds/business... It's not that hard to do in a way so that absolutely no evidence of it happening exists. Also when you then do respond to them through Reddit you are breaking This all important law you are following.. And in the end, again, you look stupid.
For over-busy businesses struggling to deal with growth.. You should always have a queue system not ..just a ticket number ..so people know their place in line. It's fucking imperative. Be professional. 
These posts are so shitty.

People will act accordingly if it is profitable to do so. Why attack the network when you can make money off of it? This incentivises miners to secure the network as they do. It's not a friend thing. It's a business and tech thing, what ever works and makes money is the way. 
In this way miners should really be given control over how many tx/s are processed. There is incentive in keeping confirmation times as low as possible and fees as low as possible since this creates a bigger economy and more total users and fees. I guess there are just trust issues going around this community, with posts like this I don't know what I feel is right. I know segwit brings amazing features and bigger blocks ... So it is strange that people who should want Bitcoin to succeed (miners) are holding back the entire expansion of network abilities.. But also they are saying hey why would we be bad guys and ruin a network we make millions off of? this is obviously where the collusion of the PBOC or Chinese Govt with chinese miner conspiracy comes from.. Because it really does make sense that timing this huge two sided smear campaign accompanied withdrawal problems on the major Chinese exchanges...pumping prices at least a bit .. Or maybe someone is just happy making the extra profit with all these fees for now. I dunno. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:19:25
I already explained. It is mutable therefore it is useless tech in my opinion. It could very well become profitable but that is far from what I am saying.
I suppose ETC would be cool if it was supported By all developers. But at that point it seems Bitcoin could support these same features with future upgrades. The THING about ETH that is allowing it to gain support is that institutions are interesting in a crypto they can manipulate and make their own... It can work just fine with the banks of today. Bankers coin.

I mean the entire globe is full of currencies currently functioning ... but are they functioning properly? Is there a lot of fudging the numbers and pushing debt and mistakes onto the user? Is there a lot of manipulation just to keep things afloat .. if so, are they truely functioning at all or are they a means to something completely different? Therefore is that not failure? I assume this is more in line with that OP is thinking. But also, historically there has not been a bank/coUntry/economy that did not not fail and kept on existing in that exact state of being...
All have changed and contorted themselves or were fucked with  to fit the needs of the elite every time around. So yes historically all banks and currencies have failed.

What makes you think vitalik cannot be compromised?
Do you really believe he is invulnerable to all attacks? 
Why bother with a system that has a single weak entry point and still has bugs as of today.
Bitcoin works today. Even though it may go through growing pains, with very little further development Bitcoin could easily stay exactly as it is and completely undermine the entire global financial system.. As it is currently doing. There is no single point of entry, there is nothing that can stop it from existing without destroying the Internet entirely and preventing future decentralized p2p intenet from existing if that is possible.

Just keep some small amount of coin you want to bring with you on an exchange or online wallet.  Delete all apps and bookmarks related to Bitcoin.  It seems so easy to avoid any interaction with these guys even if it were completely illegal.
