Would suggest you Binance/Kraken for EU.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:38:15
I have never used that wallet before but I would suggest you to try contact their support.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:21:01
Just wait a few hours and you will see it around 15-17
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:33:28
Any idea where I can find my private key in Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:10:38
Great post I'm pretty sure it's gonna help a lot of people.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:01:10
If you have that amount of BTC then there is nothing to worry about lol.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:20:19
May the hodl-force be with you.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:50:28
I think it only works for UK/EU so it's pointless for me.
@_date: 2018-05-21 03:07:19
Great art! what a valuable painting.
@_date: 2018-05-12 02:02:10
It looks like android apps or bitcoin apps BTC file explorer, BTC messenger, BTC news feed, BTC wallet I don't know the rest but awesome Icons.
@_date: 2018-05-27 02:32:57
Nice Meme. I got it.
@_date: 2018-05-24 03:31:13
Try to borrow some to your mom and dad.
@_date: 2018-05-18 00:21:18
And also scammers are everywhere, beware.
@_date: 2018-05-12 03:56:49
Many people fall into this, just spread the word to the others. Thanks, it will greatly help.
@_date: 2018-05-19 04:27:52
Just Hodl the FUD.
@_date: 2018-05-19 04:28:41
Great art!
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:07:56
Wow, it's meant to be, nice!

I think they are something up to?
@_date: 2018-05-20 08:21:01
He will ride into a rocket soon, don't worry.
@_date: 2018-05-24 00:16:25
It's damn true!
@_date: 2018-05-12 05:08:22
Yeah right, you can call it btc or father of crypto.
@_date: 2018-05-23 03:33:01
Great idea! bro.
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:53:15
dang man!. whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy??? 
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:14:22
I don't like , i like over $15k :) 
@_date: 2018-03-16 02:18:28
i use bitfinex exchanges all the time , but i never trade fiat/crypto pairs . i always use crypto/crypto pairs. and withdraw crypto also.. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:12:07
Tomorrow is the day we'll have our biggest smile while looking the trading chart.
@_date: 2018-03-23 06:11:09
Cool!! 
@_date: 2018-03-23 06:11:45
all banks are shitty! 
@_date: 2018-03-10 05:08:02
just hold it for a while...
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:33:48
I love watching his review . Thanks for sharing a great video.. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:15:24
Maybe it's true or maybe it is only speculations that binance is being hacked but I hope it will recover from any irregularities right now and maybe it is the reason of slight crash in the market right now besides the news concerning SEC
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:38:56
Bitfinex has the largest v0lume and as far as experience is concern, they have already learned in the past year of their exixtence the value of self regulations
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:39:04
nice piece of advice bro..
@_date: 2018-03-24 09:18:39
I hope it will push through
@_date: 2018-03-02 02:44:32
they have no idea about bitcoin LMAO. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 10:28:58
Bitfinex.  Specially with the inclusions of segwit on their platforms
@_date: 2018-03-03 07:44:58
Competitions brings the best of this platforms. I think it will works.
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:03:34
It was 2016 when i started in cryptocurrency and bought Bitcoin for $600+ in bitfinex.  
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:57:31
i'm hoping soon bitfinex will provide the tether audit. i was in bitfinex the whole time, first day of my trading until now. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 03:09:26
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:56:58
Are you fine big bro? 70k is Huge.. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:54:49
wow that is a very secure idea.I hope I have the same leverage as you.
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:07:59
I agree with you. The value of the coins is dependent on the followers and the technology it has
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:57:13
indeed! 
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:07:00
What a mistake , as of now you're millionaire with that bitcoins,  but you sold it.. but that's ok this is not the end of bitcoin adventure. you still have chance.. wait for the deep dip then buy in...
@_date: 2018-03-16 22:20:27
I hope this bounce will continue to break the resistance upward for us to recover from our previous loss. Just watching the uprising at bitfinex wall and I think it is promining.
@_date: 2018-03-31 05:35:38
wow that's a significant sating at 7k...LOL
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:16:17
I agree with you. bashers of bitfinex right are very silent as they are expecting any untoward incidents with these exchange that will crash their platform but at to no avail. Despite the recent crash in the market, bitfinex are doing dine in the community
@_date: 2018-03-31 05:41:00
I think not. It is far from being bullish...But many traders are waiting to have that stage because of their loses this week 
@_date: 2018-03-14 01:40:06
They know about mining.. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 06:28:46
let the panic sold their coins, then we the hodler buy more dip.. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:15:24
Both.. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 08:16:04
we are hoping also but of course, if these market will be going to the moon there must be a significant event that will push it upwards. We need a very BIG GOOD NEWS TO COMPENSATE FOR THIS MEMES.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:14:44
Alright! Way to go!
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:51:34
cash is sucks!
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:09:36
I watched the whole video lol , Very entertaining video!.. and Great voice to singer!! 
@_date: 2018-03-25 15:47:11
I Agree with your observation. I think bitfinex haters are losing their grounds day by day and they don't have enough ammo to sustain their campaign.Now they are now using a recycled post just to have one. LOL!!!
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:29:32
It's Endless my friend. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:53:59
Ask the seller to provide the TX ID , that you can check if transaction is already confirmed .. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:56:15
Hello mom! i'm on tv lol.. i am one of the hodlers in bitcoin subs.. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:27:24
Ha.ha.. whatever the cause of the pump traders will be glad to had it right right
@_date: 2018-03-31 07:02:01
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:12:07
A little bit late joining the party ey.
@_date: 2018-03-08 04:08:14
I enjoy watching this video.. thanks for sharing. keep it up.
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:46:24
I think it will try to surpass the 9k wall this weekend.At this moment 8.8 already at bitfinex and maybe it will passed through
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:37:00
0% of my friends own bitcoin :D
@_date: 2018-03-04 09:55:56
I hope legislator see the importance of cryptocurrency in the market as to allow and support their existence
@_date: 2018-03-04 00:57:20
Do you have any proof on these allegation that can substantiate your accusations or purely it is based on what you only read here? I hope you are not gullible enough to believe in FUD.
@_date: 2018-03-06 03:42:43
Noted! Thank you sir, 
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:35:30
maybe she accidentally put's 4 zero's $90,000 , instead of 3 zero's $9,000. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:23:53
Sounds interesting! 
@_date: 2018-03-04 05:33:44
Yes it is getting better specially with the development of segwit by bitcoin core group and exchanges started to adapt it.
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:45:32
That's cheap.. why are so over reacting for hating bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:09:22
You had good calculations on how inflation rate decrease the value of our money. I like it if we compare it investing our money rather than bank it
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:25:46
that is why they claim the word privacy.. lol
@_date: 2018-03-31 08:41:35
This market needs NO FUD NEWS right now, at this point that this market is down without any news from tethers or Bitfinex as a contributory factor. Where do you put the blame?
@_date: 2018-03-07 04:07:15
Watching bitfinex orders chart, i think it will hit $10,500.. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:03:19
BTC is getting more interesting.
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:35:40
I noticed that too. everything he says is against bitfinex trying to create FUD in this community
@_date: 2018-03-03 06:39:08
Yes! I agree with you. It is very significant
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:52:51
that would be interesting project.. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:19:20
Yes. I like that strategy doing that at bitfinex buying every dip as to lower the average of my loses. We can do it, especially if we have still the leverage or funds to do it.
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:42:18
True.. they thought every bad or fuds news always reflect bitcoin price.. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:42:30
What? Is that true? If the intrinsic value of bitcoin is 30k USD maybe it is made of gold of course...
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:09:26
Yes until now i'm trading in bitfinex.. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:09:53
Yeah! this is it HODLGANG! 
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:33:05
I agree with you.Some establishment right now are accepting bitcoin as payment thru QR code taken from cellphones
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:41:32
Do not invest in this community what you cannot afford to lose...It says you will gains and also have the risk of doing losing all of your money.
@_date: 2018-03-14 01:43:06
How is your experience? is it more convenient?
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:40:57
I think 70% dollar , 30% BTC . 
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:09:01


I think this dip is possible , see from $19k to $6.4k , but i hope bitcoin will never hit $1k , that will be the worst nightmare! I'm watching the order book of bitfinex right now, and there is a possibility btc will hit $11500 today.. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 07:04:54
Segwit is a great addition in the platform of bitfinex favoring bitcoin traders
@_date: 2018-03-24 09:24:24
I agree with you traders here should not invest money they need because the risk of losing is very high although their is a high percentage of gaining if you have the proper skills.
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:39:14
$9k is possible today.. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:47:49
be careful next time.. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:55:16
I hope they just bought bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:11:38


he is not making any sense. i think he's one of the leader when there's a rally against to gov't .
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:15:31
Thanks for sharing , it reminds me how cryptocurrency changed the world, 
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:59:25
Yes, it is true that there is no limit when it comes to selling in Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-03-02 00:37:23
The best for me and my fellow traders is Bitfinex adopts Segwit!
@_date: 2018-03-07 04:22:18
This is Huge!! 
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:49:06
when i'm trading in bitfinex, there is a time i lose some ,then i carefully control my emotion . and try to gain at the next trade. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:36:36
what's new today? It continues to dip...What will happen tom?
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:35:20
I'm still buying any ammount every week . i nearly reach 3btc in my bitfinex account.
@_date: 2018-03-23 06:39:02
I hope you'll forgot your seed in the future.. lol write it down for back up purposes of course. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 07:13:31
But , i read some comments that withdrawal is not available.. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 01:00:28
What purpose do you intend to use this data or info you are asking? Do you think it will be helpful for us? 
@_date: 2018-03-06 03:57:08
This is old, its just 0.0004 btc fee in bitfinex now.. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:20:26
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:26:00
that is why they claim the word privacy.. lol
@_date: 2018-03-02 00:50:55
Cool!! Great work bro. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:01:25
Good to hear! , numbers of pizza shop are gaining that accepts bitcoins.. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:00:49
yeah. I miss that opportunity bro.
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:22:39
Range Roger?
@_date: 2018-03-14 09:21:44
i think they are doing their best right now to address all the inconvenience that traders are experiencing right now. they are learning from their experience
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:44:16
Is this the reasons for this continuing crash? Watching it right now at bitfinex while this market continues to shed blood. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:08:36
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:54:46
I add more and more in my bitfinex account. Until it moons! 
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:39:29
Very well said! .. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:02:57
oh great! where i can buy this stuff?
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:29:04
Indeed! 
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:28:40
I am waiting for that. I keep monitoring it right now with bitfinex
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:04:34
Yes, then if the prediction is right , they regret for not believing .. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:58:43
Can you give some data to support your claim against bitfinex? Otherwise, this is another FUD trying to create some old issue AGAIN trying to discredit this platform 
@_date: 2018-03-05 00:55:09
You're not a hodler if you spend your bitcoin.. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:06:04
Script is more helpful , thanks lol!
@_date: 2018-03-10 03:30:43
I think having OTC transactions is more expensive than trading at the exchange but of course if the amount is huge I think they want to make sure of it. If traders has no knowledge about it, It doesn't affect this market but if they know, I think this will affect. Of course, speculations works all the time
@_date: 2018-03-07 05:16:46
It's Bitfinex cold-wallet , means all of that btc is from traders, uses to trade in exchanges..  
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:59:53
Interesting! You're great!
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:09:00
Wow, everyone has reduce their BTC withdrawal fees , even bitfinex reduce 25% .. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:07:16
haha. I feel you bro.Miss it also!
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:00:06
If this might happened , 1 Satoshi = $1 . 
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:59:58
do we need to be I.D verified?
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:32:19
been-jammin17 is right . try to do that first .. to avoid loses.
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:30:04
Okay, i decide to add more btc in y mbitfinex account. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:40:46
Yeah I agree with you. I shouldn't disrupt your life. Do not let it controls you, You must controlled it
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:03:20
Made my day! thanks for making and sharing this.. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 09:34:05
I hope it will sustain the pump to recover from the previous looses
@_date: 2018-03-14 01:29:17
Whales vs Panic seller. lol
@_date: 2018-03-31 07:03:29
This fudster wants these market to continue to crashing. What's there gains on spreading this? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:48:50
nice one.;)
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:56:32
Me too. bitcoin is the standard of this community. Most of altcoins dependents on its value
@_date: 2018-03-14 01:04:03
I HODL because i believe. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 02:46:32
Woo. this is awesome! 
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:07:56
Very interesting story lol. As of today i bought another 0.1 BTC in bitfinex. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 09:57:06
just wait it will bounce big...
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:03:31
Mine was enabled last 2 days ago.. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:28:13
i always monitor the bitfinex chart.  
@_date: 2018-03-17 02:37:42
very well said. too much speculators in this community .
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:06:50
@_date: 2018-03-06 03:46:05
We'll be happy if that happen , lol 
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:36:51
That is the downside perhaps.
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:33:30
It will be huge demand for bitcoin. bitcoin mining is over.
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:21:35
he did? when?
@_date: 2018-03-16 05:14:53
ok i understand now.. thanks 
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:49:33
Done upgrade yesterday! 
@_date: 2018-03-08 05:45:20


He's right! 
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:42:40
That's good for day-traders , they're making massive profit in bitfinex. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 09:03:02
you have a good sense of humor...
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:41:49
I have to move in Venezuela tomorrow!!.. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:21:39
Is this already available in market?? I want to withdraw my bitcoin from bitfinex to hardwallet , then to Trezor?? 
@_date: 2018-03-26 03:19:28
Probably afraid. Crypto will take their position soon.. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:25:28
of course if you sold it low. you can avoid lose if you hodl your coins. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:26:25
if this is real , i'd love to go there and take selfie.. lol 
@_date: 2018-03-24 03:30:20
maybe better wait for this development
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:00:45
He's sad... 
@_date: 2018-03-13 05:00:03
A good helps to us and our fellow traders, bitfinex implement segwit.. a good job for bitfinex.. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:20:08
Yes of course if you have the large amount of withdrawal with bitfinex you will be tag with AML and KYC protocol so verifications process will be done
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:26:26
looking for it bro
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:46:11
this will be a huge development for this community. Government starting to accept cryptocurrency in the market and becoming so popular.Expect bullish outcome for this, hopefully
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:01:58
yeah , when they get scam they're crying like baby.. better transfer their funds to personal wallet to avoid scam or shit hacks..  
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:36:43
Very informative video! This will help Beginner's in bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:27:47
If i am the landlord i will accept your bitcoin! lol
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:49:10
is this an overstatement...market is down right now!!!
@_date: 2018-03-27 02:48:07
Such wow! 
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:40:42
I will wait for that time it will cause another dip maybe because 166,344 amounts of bitcoins will be release again by the court handling the case of mt. gox
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:13:13
Hahah legit.
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:02:07
Great news! Thanks.
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:00:38
you seem like a shill to me.
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:07:27
I'm not excited for binance will accept USD soon. i've been using bitfinex and has USD pairs for a long time.. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:18:37
I think it will not reach even binance confirmed if they have been hacked or not. Maybe at 8k it will be realistic.
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:14:16
This is great and funny.
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:46:39
Install hard wallet or bought trezor.. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:14:10
hell yeah!
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:55:41
This is good thanks for sharing..
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:36:04
Dump now , moon later.
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:36:10
holiday seasons contribute to this dip but I hope it will bounce back after this holidays
@_date: 2018-03-10 05:53:12
because of this events it results to traders speculations resulting a slight crash in the market

@_date: 2018-03-04 14:56:37
Bitcoin is holding at 11k if you are planning to buy some bitcoin maybe better to wait a little longer until it breaks the 11k barriers or for hoddlers they are also waiting to have a bull run. Mine just holding it for a while and watching bitcoin price at bitfinex
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:47:28
I think btc bleeding because of traders behavior in the market like the speculations for the incoming meetings and of course the law of supply and demand has something to do with this dip. For instance the, the release of bitcoin recently from mt. gox contribute dip in this market 
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:02:02
Good thing.. very helpful. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:18:16
This is a big show.. i hope they have a HD stream if this happen .. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:31:39
I think that is correct observation because the resistance in 9.5 is so strong
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:09:07

The future of bitcoin is near! For now just some of businesses accepting bitcoin.. because they have the knowledge about crypto currencies.. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 15:01:04
Because of the implementation of segwit BTC prices up of course and because of this new methods, resulting in a faster transactions and lower trading fee. It is for the benefit of the traders.
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:56:15
he is our hero.. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 00:53:07
Segwit has a very good help to all our fellow traders who using bitfinex, 
@_date: 2018-03-02 00:56:34
Same here , bought bitcoin recently in bitfinex.. i hope this will be huge..
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:21:53
Buy more and hodl.
@_date: 2018-03-06 02:33:27
I also looking for this , thanks for sharing.. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:04:51
Same here, some of my cash , after all expenses i put in bitfinex to bought some coins to add in my portfolio, i had read lot of article's and i can see the potential in the future.. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:11:51
Great read! This is why i love being involved in crypto.. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:08:22
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:57:33
I think it is good for wash trading because there is no need to provide KYC.
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:57:05
how about internet explorer is the slowest browser
same with bitcoin the slowest transaction? 
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:41:28
I think every exchanges experiencing downtrends publicity which will put traders in the speculation mode. Thus, who will benefit from this actions?
@_date: 2018-03-12 01:18:16
Yes , you're right we must be aware with Bcash ,now i don't have any concern with that anymore after i sold my bcash in bitfinex.. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 05:35:10
this will help Malta's economy of course
@_date: 2018-03-12 01:14:05
I'm glad i didn't use this exchanges.. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 06:36:46
at least they announce it early.. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 03:55:08
crypto market right now are becoming popular and gaining support from different government and I think this is a development for this community
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:20:43
I saw the same post but it said $500k. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:07:19
I think you need to do the major rules of traders/hodlers , sell 60-70% , then hodl the remaining 30-40%.. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:39:35
I love reading the story behind her trip.. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:46:39
Can you cite some of your analysis regarding this FUD and what are the reasons to support your claims?
@_date: 2018-03-31 09:03:39
Reading this conversation about bitfinex shows different motives in every comment I've read. One thing I observe, this insolvency issue was a very old news
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:37:17
Bitfinex is a better choice
@_date: 2018-03-10 10:31:53
I think it will not crash at 5k$. Bitcoin right now is very stable at 9k$  and traders continue to hold for a while hoping for the moon.
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:25:52
I don't think it takes 6-8weeks verification in bitfinex, i think 2-3weeks when i get verified .. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:46:16
@_date: 2018-03-23 06:01:34
soon it will be currency. when 1 sats = $1 .

You're in the good hand.. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:00:13
do we need to be I.D verified?
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:00:44
Great ! $3 - $4b is huge! 
@_date: 2018-03-27 02:23:36
i used bitfinex 
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:53:24
Cryptomarket are getting support right now and It is now the right time to invest because of the positive outlook of different government for the future of this market. Expect a bullish run if this will trends continue. Me just holding my coins while watching price movement at bitfinex walls
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:44:02
Under 5.5k! then pump it to 25k how geat is that right? 
@_date: 2018-03-31 08:27:58
you are right. The dip the last February is very strong and sudden so many traders were caught off guard in that crash. But it recovers in fast mode also. Unlike right now it was in a stagnant status.
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:34:23
this is a big development 
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:26:23
nice stratetegy
@_date: 2018-03-16 05:15:36
yeah, same here. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:10:53
I agree with that. Trading here is a lot of risk of course there are lots of gains too but of course it is how make decisions here.
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:23:24
I think better to hold it for a while. because of the positive acceptance of different government right now like in Malta and Japan expect there will be a bull run that will happen.
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:33:38
I was looking for this.. thanks mate!
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:57:42
They predict btc will hit $3k ..
@_date: 2018-03-22 03:55:35
This kind of incident already happened from other banks.. they closed or suspend account that's involved in bitcoins or cryptocurrencies..  
@_date: 2018-03-31 05:57:06
wow.l we hope so. to much looses right now
@_date: 2018-03-04 00:51:58
Wow.. This is nice specially to the bitcoin traders.faster transaction at a lower fees;)
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:34:08
oh shit really in bitfinex? i feel the $6k dip ughh.. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 01:27:58
If the pump from december 2017 will be happen the same on december 2018 , i think it will be yearly the biggest pump every december , 
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:25:40
that is why they claim the word privacy.. lol
@_date: 2018-03-26 03:13:02
it sounds fun! 
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:22:52
It looks like fireworks! 
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:20:00
it is the best time to buy now and sold it later
@_date: 2018-03-08 08:32:51
it will cause a big dip for this market of course because most of the exchanges right now are using  tethers in their platforms.
@_date: 2018-03-04 00:49:58
Yeah! I agree with that.
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:32:18
dang, that's huge.. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:59:52
WOW... But it is an overstatement...Maybe 15k it is more realistic. Looking at the walls of bitfinex and analyzing the factors affecting prices. Maybe that's the best bitcoin will get until June
@_date: 2018-03-26 03:05:20
I'm regularly buying bitcoins every week or some times twice a month in bitfinex. i do hodl my bitcoins. never sold since $17k 
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:45:45
Our president hates drugs.

Wealthy is the one who owned banks.. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:53:42
I hope it will reach the 12k
@_date: 2018-03-10 10:47:08
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:55:33
I am using it right now to my investment and I am very much contented how they(bitfinex) handled my financial transactions
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:42:02
I think everybody is hoping that btc will bounce eventually. Keeping their faith with it.
@_date: 2018-03-16 04:25:31
that is why they claim the word privacy.. lol
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:17:45
that's right you've caught at fishing site. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:23:06
Maybe it will be a positive move for bitfinex to move out in Switzerland and if the Swiss government welcome them this will be beneficial to bitfinex because of Switzerland legacy in the banking industry 
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:41:40
This innovation will favor bitcoin traders because of the lower transaction fees. It was already use by bitfinex on their exchange
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:35:57
Cool stuff! 
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:39:47
I feel you bro...just hanging ;)
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:09:49
I think this is true as to manipulate the price in the market. I think better to trust exchanges not chinese origin like bitfinex, it is one of the legitimate exchanges in the market
@_date: 2018-03-23 06:07:54
I bought in bitfinex at $18k and ride down to 6k. until now i don't want to look my portfolio for the reason i bought the high and this is my first involvement in crypto.
@_date: 2018-03-04 14:58:16
I agree with that. for long term now is the time but if not don't buy right now
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:56:57
@_date: 2018-03-04 10:05:56
This speculations of tethers crashing resulting to market crash of all exchange is already an old news. Last January Fudl'ers release the publicity of having bitfinex being subpoena by  CFTC which results to speculations of traders and a mild crash in the community. After that news, eventually the market recovers and bitfinex showed it was issued last december 2017. ING Bank also announce that they have a financial relations with it. They have also assures all their traders that they are very willing to undergo in any investigations or audit CFTC may demand. So until this point of time bitfinex is doing fine in this market  
@_date: 2018-03-07 04:12:17
Hahaha. Where you from? 
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:19:35

Sad, the titties are sideways.
@_date: 2018-04-16 11:14:03
Not a lot of people are being honest with them because they haven't been getting much profits lately.
@_date: 2018-04-04 00:21:51
So, I have to log in my account on your app? does your app safe?
@_date: 2018-04-04 02:09:26
Use bitfinex. I used this exchanges for years. and I do make a good profit every day.
@_date: 2018-04-03 23:46:35
What is Coinance? what would be my benefit if I use this? I'm trading in bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:54:12
You can obviously see the sign there stating Ethereum as well.
@_date: 2018-04-04 02:16:07
Damn! 
@_date: 2018-04-03 01:08:38
FUD please stay away from us. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 01:16:32
Great news!
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:16:20
if you want to be secure put it in a more bigger platform such as bitfinex
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:49:47
Ugh. Same here, I was too excited when the price pump in bitfinex chart.
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:48:23
I like the BTM's, but the fees.. At least it's cool.
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:02:34
Goodluck for your moving on. I hope you can help make this community better than previous that you are one of the CEO    trying o manipulate this market
@_date: 2018-04-01 05:41:49
I think it will play between 6.8 to 7.2 and we will see how it will move this coming week after this holiday seasons.
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:15:12
I still don't why Amazon don't have to pay the taxes.
@_date: 2018-04-08 07:16:58
7400 is attainable but 74k I think it is a dream
@_date: 2018-04-03 01:16:21
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:28:25
maybe bitfinex support can help you to sort it out for you
@_date: 2018-04-04 01:20:50
Looks pretty good.
@_date: 2018-04-15 11:27:01
The most I had was around 0.2
@_date: 2018-04-03 01:14:00
Very interesting article! 
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:22:51
I'll try to teach my momma to trade on exchanges, like bitfinex,binance,kraken. lol 
@_date: 2018-04-01 04:33:06
I hope it was already this dip. Hoping for recovery
@_date: 2018-04-04 01:48:39
7300 again in bitfinex chart.
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:49:47
That's really bad.
@_date: 2018-04-05 04:27:24
Seems true!
@_date: 2018-04-04 01:44:52
Sounds good. thanks!
@_date: 2018-04-01 03:45:58
While watching  the bitfinex wall, I think this trend will stay between 6.9 to 7.2 until this day and we will see a dramatic movement on Monday when regular business transactions resume
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:55:00
Bitfinex or Kraken. But I always use Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-04-03 01:14:29
Lol! 
@_date: 2018-04-04 02:29:39
Use bitfinex. I think their transaction fee is 0.0004BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-04 01:37:58
Nearly moon days.
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:47:03

Very cool!
@_date: 2018-04-04 02:18:57
@_date: 2018-04-04 01:48:11
Sad but true. I think you have to move on and never repeat this step. You should be more careful at this time if you're not planning to quit in crypto. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 01:28:31
Well played!
@_date: 2018-04-03 01:41:30
I always like Vitalik and Ethereum. This is why I always add more ETH in my bitfinex account every week.
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:06:07
Maybe bitcoin is down right now but I think it will bounce hard. Just waiting for the right timing 
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:45:59
Great! 
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:14:20
Whew! That's massive! I'm curious how many countries will follow.
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:22:50
Yes you could hold it for a while and sell it when this market recovers
@_date: 2018-04-04 02:21:03
Bitfinex. I do trade my Btc to monero there, without any problem. and they have the low fee. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:21:42
LOL!! Nice one haha...
@_date: 2018-04-03 01:07:26
Nice if no fee.
@_date: 2018-04-04 01:20:30
Oh man. I will visit this mall.
