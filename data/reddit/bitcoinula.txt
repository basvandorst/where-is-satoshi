It's not bitcoin who done it, it's a person but also agreed innocent till proven guilty. +1 for resigning from foundation till legal bits sorted.

Don't think so. If bitbet.cc comes online again I'll check it out and maybe try my username and password. I checked the two domain name register details and bitbet.com was registered with Godaddy.com on November 21, 2012 by Rafael Chaves. Bitbet.cc details a bit more obscured and info protected by enom.com service. Domain was registered on March 08, 2013.
So, to me it looks like two different owners. Why would one owner go open and anon with similar domains? Just my opinion why I think they not related.

A large internet industry/sector that contribute billions to keeping the internet rolling for years - makes the world of internet go round is marketing and advertising. Companies allocate large budgets towards their online media spend. Guess what? Bitcoin is making inroads in the online advertising industry with very successful bitcoin enabled advertising networks starting up.
This I see as another major factor that will increase the volume of bitcoin transactions because advertisers would find it easier to pay for advertising and publisher easier get paid to serve the adverts.
Think of large content networks consolidating their various currencies they need to process for advertising revenue into a more liquid currency like bitcoin.
Lots of fiat allocated for online marketing going forward would end up in bitcoin blockchain :) Large brands as mentioned already adopting the various uses of bitcoin but just imagine when large brands start demanding more bitcoin advertising options from large brand advertising networks like Google, Yahoo etc. 
Just take a look around you - the internet is sponsored by advertising and it's a sexy match... (*)

Hi, many thanks for your feedback and advice :) I know faucets are controversial with varied opinions but even bottom feeders needs to eat and are part of the overall food chain. My next app might be more on the Bitcoin service side.

I bought some KHs here a while ago and it's ticking over nicely, actually every 10 minutes. But this post is a follow up about their referral system where you earn 5% on all BTC earnings mined by people who joined under you. I have a couple of people now with two that already bought a substantial amount of KHs - so it's a great passive way to earn BTC for those able to refer people.

Thanks for you opinion on my work :) Faucets are indeed controversial and with any online environment you always have spammers and fraudsters joining the game and exploiting an idea. Faucets where created to introduce Bitcoins to the mainstream enabling people to get some satochi's into a wallet. Recently faucets also contributed to the idea of microwallets that evolved into some great stand alone apps like SpareCoins and similar mircowallet services making it easier and more secure to just keep small amounts of bitcoins in an online wallet system.
For advertising you get click fraud all over the place and more so on made for adsense type blogs. Faucets are advertising exposure to also again get more advertisers aware of crypto currencies and encourage new crypto currency based advertising services.
Scammers, fraudsters, hackers and crackers are all over in everything online. That is why I actually created my surfer app in such a way that visitors could report on the status of the faucet, with option to add ANY comments.
I could in next release actually display all these comments submitted and make it more transparent and user driven. Faucets are not going away, because they are direct link to online advertising. So, improvement and innovation the best option :)

Hi, i like the fact that the people who developed this site also commenting in this discussion - good sign :) I like the referral structure in this program and the fact that it also give you other cryptocoins to help grow not just bitcoin awareness.
I went ahead and wrote a little blog post about Qionpro here 
and planning to expand this info as and when I get more.

Please consider creating a bitcoin miner platform type game. Would be a great way to introduce more people to the basics of bitcoin and crypto currencies.
Imagine a Mario Brothers type platform game but based on the blockchain as the environment. The character being an asic chip and it plays the various blockchain levels mining (collecting) coins. On his way there would be obstacles like hash rate increase, electricity surges, stale blocks etc.
The miner will be able to buy more hash power with the coins collected making him stronger or faster. Each new level up playing the difficulty rate could increase depending on the amount of bitcoins collected on the previous level and points.
A basic game like this could be designed with something like flash and made available to share on those online flash game sites or even via google app store - more people would know about bitcoin in an edutainment way.
Just an idea seeing that you a game developer and interested in bitcoin integration. You'll create more future customers that know about bitcoins :)

Okay, please play nice here :) Just done post about gambling and bitcoins. I know in some countries it's still illegal but in others like mine it's legit and I do enjoy the freedom to decide if I want to play in the comfort of my own home or go to a crowed badly air conditioned cheap cologne smell and boozy type gambling joint to win or loose.
I much prefer watching some sports on the box and able to hit some odds on a game or two. Some in some way bitcoin also brought anonymous convenience to gambling / sports betting.
Oh, yes in my day job I also work for a company that runs physical sport betting shops in Africa. People do win big on games because they know their teams and who they playing. Gets to be a very involved process of choosing the spreads etc. but some guys are pros and living a good life.
Still really can't understand why some countries find it legal to go to a physical casino to gamble but online gambling illegal. Suppose it's the same thinking that smoking tobacco cigarettes in public places need to be illegal but smoking those electric ones are just fine.

yes, this is total bs disaster for people building business around the bitcoin blockchain. Yesterday I did x5 payments to x5 different recipients all exactly the same amount 0,04563709 via blockchain.info wallet. One of them still pending confirmation - almost 24hrs now.
Imagine you have a business with basic SLA's in this case max 36hrs. Now I'm having to deal with 1/5 issues on payments - that = getting more support staff. Not cool at all :(
Before you flame me down for posting this and using blockchain.info api - I try and support those that have been around for a while like blockchain.info but hey, suppose this lul slow . . .   .   .   .     ....     .....  confirmations ....    ....     ...  . .    ..     ...    .....    ....   .. needs to happen because whats been happening in bitcoin space classic / fork / block size / miner rewards etc.
This is not a bitch - just my on the ground case running something using bitcoin as a means to pay for goods and services. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 19:45:19
Could very possibly be the case but my point is, it's totally random which transactions are held and this has never happened to me in the past using various wallets. This is just some crazy crypto war between what ever parties with their agenda's on forks, versions, spam attacks, miners picking higher transactions etc. and the majority of users and supporters caught in the crossfire.
I paid 0.0001 BTC for a 0.04600345 transaction - think it's the going rate.
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:05:58
must agree with this - yesterday done x5 transaction all exactly the same amounts to different recipients but one of them still pending confirmation almost 24hrs. Same amounts, same miner fees one in mempool now - random.

Honestly, for me it's more like a mind fucked hack and I know I'm not Wright...
@_date: 2016-05-02 15:00:19
hope people are saving his blog posts for historical review because I'm sure pretty soon his posts or entire very new site will be edited to "correct these errors"...
This is another SAD but very eventful day in Bitcoin land but such is Bitcoin.
I truly hope this Mr (Dr) Wright is the Wrong Satoshi and people that got hacked and mind fucked will recover from this. 
Why? This looks WRONG and the media knew before the community - I smell fish.

Ha, okay thanks for posting this link. I'll take the risk here (seeing that I posted info about them on my site) Placed some funds and then see how it goes then post back here or on my site. I also saw some posts on the moneymakergroup.com forum and so far it looks like they paying out.

Hi All, because it's a mission to earn bitcoins from faucets and so little at a time I decided to code a little surf app. Now makes it easier having all faucets on one page and grouped. Click on tabs, surf and when done, click on menu drop downs to select next faucet.
Also add some features to actually help report on faucets status i.e. paying, not paying, dry etc. Also place for people to submit any new faucets found. It's still new but I think it works well making the whole process more efficient and less pain.
Adding another section about more ways to get bitcoins besides faucets but that's not the main focus.
Please check it out and earn some Bitcoins and submit more!

Join a collective mining using the most competitive $USD per Gh/s bitcoin mining machines.  Using the Bitcoin Mining as a Service (MaaS) model these operations break large-scale datacenter mining down to easily manageable pieces. This make the process of mining for bitcoins simple, scalable and cost effective for their clients. Bitcoin Mining as a Service Advantage

Well China showing their true colors now and I agree with some comments that not all Chinese will be selling rather keep and find other means to spend it online. I personally am in it for the long haul and will keep converting FIAT to crypto coins and also keep mining them. 2014 will be good for Bitcoin innovations in services and hopeful that the asic back orders catch up with the demand. Going to be interesting first quarter with many large mines coming online :)

Thanx for the heads up! I'll follow this &amp; also see what happens after the 20th with their bitcoin miner.

I found this new mining as a service company based in Irland Dublin according to their about us info. I have some success with buying Bitcoin hashing power from these cloud mining programs and going to give this one a try also.

Note that the click URL to new site goes through CoinURL as all my external links do on Bitcoinula.com because that's how links are monetised with url services on my site, so skip the ad to get to the new site. I saw that the Bitcoin mining marked to go live on the 20th December, so I'll prob. do a review on that part when it goes live.

All faucets pay small and a major pain to find and surf, so I went ahead and coded a faucet surfer here 
Now easy surf faucets all on one page using grouped tabs. Also visitors can report on status and add new ones. For people new to bitcoins and want to get at least some this might help.
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:26:53
This is a great little browser app! I installed it without any hassle and it looks pretty neat indeed. I also wrote an article about your app on my site so hopefully that would contribute to more download traffic and back links for link PR. Makes sense to go open source because others have valuable insight they are able to contribute to your project.
