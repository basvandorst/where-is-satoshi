Until descentralized exchanges and atomic swaps.

No, because of the nature of trading being a negative sum game. There will be a group which will be able to make money off of the market, patterns will develop, whoever sees these patterns and takes advantage of them will end up profitable.
Luckily all market participants are not daytraders, some buy and hold as a form of fundamental investment, some swing trade, some scalp and even within these 3 trade strategies every market participant does different amounts of research and execute differently. 
I know plenty of successful daytraders and I myself am slightly green day in and day out; it all comes down to discipline, risk management and research. 
The problem I see with the types of posts like the one by OP is basically arguing that because they can't achieve success, nobody can and the whole field is a sham, when in reality, it's because those traders made stupid mistakes like buying something at ATH because they saw it being pumped on /biz/ or some shady PnD group.
In fact, I could even make an argument that the people that constantly scream "just HOLD" and complain about "weak hands" are in fact disingenuous and incredibly self-serving for the purpose of unloading their bags onto someone else.

Because it's easier to lay blame on an omnipotent evil presence (whales, algos, manipulators, the devil) than to accept personal responsability in your failures.

I get that. I just haven't been in VZ since 2015 when the 100Bs note was still brown. That's why it surprised me.

oh dude, I didn't know they changed the color palette just to add 3 zeroes. Where is el Bolivar Fuerte?
