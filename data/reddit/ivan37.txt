Look up money transmission laws in the US - there are different levels of regulation.  Coinbase explicitly states that they aren't money transmitters in their [user agreement]( and have tailored their service to make sure that they wouldn't fall into that category.

They aren't registered as money transmitters with the state, but they are registered with the federal government (FINCEN) as a "Money Services Business".
They don't need to be registered currently with the states because they've built their service to NOT have the kinds of features that would require them to be registered as money transmitters.  This is why adding some of the kinds of features you're interested in probably won't happen any time soon unfortunately (...even though I'm sure they'd love to become a more complete exchange if all it meant was doing the coding for them).

Gox runs buggy custom software that was creating bad transactions so their support staff was having to constantly re-send payments.  Some people probably used a known, minor issue with Bitcoin (and an issue that Gox has known about) to trick their support staff into re-sending some successful payments twice.  They lost money, so to try covering their asses legally and probably in the hopes of tanking the market so they can buy the missing coins back at a lower price they're trying to throw Bitcoin under the bus.

You prove what was in your wallet the same way you'd prove that you owned the ring that was stolen or the painting that was hanging on the wall that burnt down.  Keep documentation that you purchased it and it is even better if you have some sort of reasonable documentation supporting the fact that the item was where you are saying it was.
As long as there aren't restrictions on digital items in your policy, your claim is within the limits for whatever they want to classify Bitcoin as (probably a monetary instrument with extremely low limits normally), and it is a small claim that doesn't raise flags with the insurance risk department it would probably get paid without a problem.

Lets say you buy a $2000 item for 4 BTC that had a cost basis of $4000 (BTC obtained at $1000).  You now have $2000 of capital losses that you can deduct from your income.  If your marginal tax rate is, say, 30% then you're saving $600.  Obviously everyone's tax rates will be much different, though, so some people might save significantly less (...or $0) (...or much more).
Certainly not a free item and you have to wait until the tax return to "realize" the tax savings, but certainly worth claiming the loss if you have them.
Not sure what you mean about arbitrage opportunity - there is a limit of $3000 to deduct from regular income and you're realizing a loss (you have a cost basis of $4000 so you essentially lost $2000 and are only getting $600 tax savings for an overall loss of $1400).  If you mean somehow transferring the loss to someone else that isn't possible legally.

Realizing capital gains/losses doesn't only apply when purchasing physical goods - it also applies when converting to fiat currency.  Perhaps the new IRS guidance is causing a bit too much focus to be put on the implications of purchasing of physical goods.

Right - we already know that Gox had been creating bad transactions with their buggy custom client so their support staff was having to manually re-send payments constantly.  What probably happened was that some people probably took advantage of this by using this issue to trick their support staff into manually re-sending some payments twice that had actually been sent.  Their support staff just said "oh, here is another one that didn't go through - I'll manually resend it" without having the correct, additional checks in place.
Now that they've either lost a bunch of money or can't quickly untangle their failed transaction mess they want to point blame elsewhere.  ...and if the market tanks enough then maybe they can buy back all of the missing funds at a low price to maybe stay afloat.

Yes - you're on the right track.  Another example is that there is a decentralized exchange that is going to use prepared transactions along with game theory so that each side of an exchange shows each other prepared transactions incrementally (without broadcasting to the network).  So, I can show the other side a 1 bit transaction demonstrating my good faith and the other side shows a 2 bit transaction to me, then slowly the amounts being transferred in the transactions increase until the amounts being sent are the full amounts agreed upon.  If one side walks away then they can lose the partial btc they exposed in one of the partial transactions, so the incentive is to complete the transaction fully as agreed upon and there is no middle man or arbitrator.

Accounting and tax liabilities aren't really the problem.  Every major accounting system and even most small accounting systems keep track of currencies and commodities for tax purposes.  The only pain with Bitcoin when it comes to some accounting packages AFAIK is the fact that you want to be able to track down to 1 Satoshi which is a much smaller fraction than most currencies need to track.
The problems when it comes to taxes/accounting are regulatory chicken-and-egg issues as no one knows exactly how government(s) will classify Bitcoin (currency/commodity/other) and that decision impacts all kinds of (usually relatively minor) rules when it comes to taxes.  The only way we'll get better regulatory information, though, is if there are enough businesses using Bitcoin and accounting for them in different ways that the tax agencies decide that they need to issue rules or if the tax agencies decide to simply start auditing/fining businesses who are accounting for Bitcoin in the way(s) they decide to be wrong.  Businesses/CPAs/Lawyers like to be conservative, don't like this kind of uncertainty, and don't potentially want to be the tax law guinea pigs.  Hiring more CPAs/Lawyers unfortunately won't itself solve the problem.

Plausible deniability is done best when you seem as innocent as possible and can maximize the doubt in the adversary's head that what they're looking at (if they see anything at all) is not what they're looking for.  Giving the adversary something to point to and say "this is a file called wallet and looks like a wallet" while you're saying "Aha, but I came up with this tricky process to generate fake wallets" does not inspire confidence in a thief that you aren't tricking them.  You're giving them something to point to and demand that you "DECRYPT IT", a good reason to think you're hiding something, and an excuse to coerce you into telling them the truth.
It seems like you're much better off keeping a few "checking" wallets and a "savings" wallet and hiding the bulk of your btc in the savings wallet.  Hide the savings wallet (even via something like a [Brainwallet]( and the thief can still believe that you have something more, but if they don't have something to point to and no explicit reason to think that you're being sneaky then I think they're much more likely to give up sooner.

Running out isn't a problem - and won't ever be a problem.
Say, for example, that there were only 1 billion possible addresses and 100,000 of them had a balance.  In this scenario it would mean that every time you started a new wallet with the Bitcoin software you'd have a 1% chance of having an address generated that was a collision with an existing address that already has a balance that you could then use.  Obviously, this would make Bitcoin unusable so it illustrates how big of a number we have to achieve in order to make the Bitcoin system possible.   It also illustrates why running out will never be a problem - there would be problems with collisions well before we'd run out of addresses.  The possible collision problem can be easily addressed in the future, if needed, by tweaking the protocol which likely would end up increasing the number of possible addresses.
This is why the number of possible addresses approaches the number of atoms in planet Earth.

You don't have bitcoins.  The only thing that the wallet.dat contains are the encryption keys that prove that you "own" the address that bitcoins were "sent" to.  
Think of the wallet.dat as more like a wallet of ID cards rather than actually holding anything resembling currency.  Think of the bitcoin network and transaction log as a bank that keeps track of everyone's balance.  If you want to transfer bitcoins to a friend, you go to the bank with your ID card (the encryption key in your wallet.dat) and tell them you'd like to make a transfer.  As long as the bank says that your balance is high enough and you can prove with your encryption key that you are the person who you say that you are, then you can proceed.  If you try to make the transaction again (even if you approach the bank with a different copy of your ID cards), but no longer have enough of a balance according to the bank, then they'll tell you "sorry".

A wallet contains multiple keys that correspond to different bitcoin addresses.  Wallets generally pre-generate a number of addresses, but as you make transactions they'll generate more addresses.  If a new address is generated, then it would only be in the wallet that was actively being used, so generally it is recommended to constantly make backups because your old backups may not contain all of the addresses that contain funds.

You do realize that a single bitcoin is worth significantly more now that it was even just a year ago.  The bitcoin output is going to go down when the price spikes up because it takes far fewer bitcoin to transmit the same amount of value.
Edit - doing some math: the peak of output in the past year was late Oct where something like $30,422,491 USD worth of Bitcoin outputs were transacted.  The lowest point in the past few months was late June where something like $53,365,344 USD worth of Bitcoin outputs were transacted.  So even doing a completely unfair comparison of the MAX versus the MIN if you factor in the exchange rate there is still a far greater amount amount of USD value being transacted with bitcoin post-bubble compared to pre-bubble over the past year.

1. The FinCEN guidance was the warning that the exchanges needed to get their documentation in order and apparently Gox didn't.  Not surprising.
2. Would love to know who the "confidential informant" is and whether it was personal since there are many enemies of Gox specifically, but also Bitcoin in general.
3. Seems like something that Gox should be able to throw some money at to make go away relatively quickly if they want, but also allows their competitors and startups a huge opportunity to get a (bigger) foothold in the US market.

yes, it is entirely up to the miners to decide which transactions make it into the blockchain.  Theoretically miners could refuse to accept your transaction, but they'd have to all coordinate which is next to impossible.  All it would take is 1 miner to get the transaction added: plus the larger the transaction fee the more enticing it would be for a miner to ignore whatever coordination has been set up to omit your transaction.

Has anyone come up with a plausible mass backdoor scenario?  I can't think of one that wouldn't make the backdoor - or at least the probable presence of a backdoor - apparent to someone analyzing the chips or the output.  That would put Intel's entire reputation at significant risk which I don't think they could do.
In fact, it seems more plausible that the government was fine with allowing the true hardware RNG to be included in Intels' processors.  That way, even open source projects like Linux start using the hardware by default.  Then, the government could order a small batch of "faulty" processors from Intel that do have predictable RNG output and have those inserted into the select machines destined for foreign government offices (or other targets).  Before, open source software RNG wouldn't be backdoor-able.  Once even the open-source software starts relying more on the hardware, though, a backdoor becomes more possible.

The best you could hope for is that they'd make a customer service decision to go out of their way in order to make you happy but obviously Bitcoin exchanges have plenty of other priorities at the moment over customer service as the wait times indicate.
As Bitcoin grows, hopefully support staff should be more properly trained on how Bitcoin works, customer service can be a priority with faster response times, and less commonly-encountered issues can be handled better or at least be better addressed.

It isn't going to be stable any time soon because it is just getting started: the market cap is currently only 1 billion.  Any number of wealthy individuals or corporations can put a tiny amount of their net worth into or out of bitcoin to make the rate jump around like crazy.  Once we get past the initial adoption phase then the market cap and liquidity should be large enough to make it more stable.

There is a lot of data available in the Bitcoin world that you could analyze:
* comparing price movements across different exchanges perhaps across different currencies
* correlations between mining difficulty and price
* correlations between activity (number of transactions)
* perhaps if you're supposed to "solve a problem" then you could guess how many active users there are in the Bitcoin world

No doubt: however I don't see how BFL expects to exist as a long-term business when they publicly treat their *paying* customers like this.

No: 2 factor is only used to secure access to your account from the outside.  Basically, just to prevent someone from accessing your account because they guessed/hacked/sniffed or otherwise determined your password.

I don't think this is true - many of the main players have moved to more sophisticated multi-exchange averages - particularly after all of the Gox downtime over the past few months.
 * Bitcoinstore uses bitpay's API for pricing which draws upon multiple exchanges (I believe).
 * Bitcoinin has said that they use multiple exchanges to do their own moving average calculation.

Bitcoin addresses "appear" random and aren't sequential though they have some structure to them.  Simply changing one character will likely result in an invalid address which will probably be rejected if you tried to send anything to it.  If you found an address by randomly changing characters until you found one that was valid and sent something to it, however, those coins would be "lost": effectively increasing the value of everybody else's coins because you're limiting the possible supply.

Find someone technology-savvy that you trust - or get up to speed on Bitcoin yourself if you have a tech background.  Don't trust random strangers online to provide assistance unless you have a firm understanding yourself to prevent getting ripped off.  
The very first thing you need to figure out is which Bitcoin client(s) that they used and whether they might have paper wallet(s).

First, you're probably a bit early in the Bitcoin economy growth.  It needs to grow a bit more before specialty stores will be able to sustain themselves: think about how difficult it would have been to start a Paypal-only outdoor store when Paypal was still starting out and few people had Paypal accounts.
Second, Bitcoin e-commerce requires significant trust in the merchant.  If a transaction goes south the customer needs to know you'll take care of them and it takes time to build a reputation for being not only legit but also customer-focused.  Encourage those who make purchases from you to add reviews across the internet so that others can determine that you take care of your customers.
You're well positioned: the 4th quarter is almost here which is when something like 75% of online retail happens.  Make sure you join the Bitcoin Friday festivities (Bitcoin's version of black friday).  As your reputation grows and as the economy grows you should be able to keep growing with it.  I just wouldn't expect to be making a living wage until next year at the earliest.

Be careful and always keep backups of everything you do when you're importing and exporting coins between wallets: different wallets operate in different ways so people sometimes run into problems when the wallet that they thought was empty gets deleted but actually still had coins in it.




If blockchain.info was compromised then your BTC are still safe because your keys would still be encrypted by your password.  If, however, the password to your wallet was also compromised then your BTC wouldn't be safe.


Yes, make backups if you intend on making any transactions from Multibit.  Desktop clients use hidden "change" addresses if you send BTC anywhere and those generated addresses won't be on your blockchain wallet.


No, you don't have to remove them.
If you aren't concerned about your Blockchain password choice and don't need access to your BTC right now, then I'd recommend waiting for Blockchain to come back.
If you need access to the BTC now, then go ahead and make transactions from Multibit (AFTER you've backed the wallet up).
If you are concerned that your password choice is poor then transfer all of your BTC to an address that Multibit generated for you (again, AFTER you've backed that wallet up).  This will transfer everything away from the Blockchain wallet.

The "reward coins" (10% of all sold) also stick out as somewhat disappointing: their stated purpose is to "ensure that we have plenty of motivation to increase the value of MasterCoins by completing the features desired by users".  If you get the reward coins on a certain schedule regardless, though, then it doesn't seem like the reward coin mechanism itself is that much of a motivation.  Really it is just a re-designed pre-mining mechanism.

1. Create a localbitcoins account, start advertising (both buying and selling if possible).
2. Buy a domain that includes bitcoin and your country/state/city name in it.  Put up a small website that describes what you offer, link to localbitcoins.
3. Make some posts in relevant forums/subreddits/sites describing your service and again linking to site and localbitcoins account and again include key phrases like "buying bitcoins in &lt;country&gt;"
4. Read up on safety precautions so you don't get ripped off
5. If you aren't already, become knowledgeable about different wallets, cold storage, etc: your customers will ask questions.
Less than a day's worth of work and you should start becoming a top hit if anyone does searches for your area and anything to do with Bitcoin.  If you also have a tech background this might also eventually result in consulting gigs as you've established yourself as a local knowledgeable resource.  Don't worry if you don't get too many inquiries - particularly at first since you won't have many reviews - business should pick up over time.
Once you have the online presence established and if you want to invest more time, then you can try posting flyers in areas that might have a Bitcoin demographic.  Finally, if you have a local newspaper or news website try seeing if they'd be interested in doing a story about Bitcoin - they can make it local by including info about your local services and you can ask others you've sold to if they'd want to be interviewed for it as well.  You can hand the reporter a story about a local connection to a huge interesting global phenomenon and you get local publicity.

At this point in time the market has determined the current value of 1 BTC at $120 USD and everyone knows exactly how many BTC exist (which include whatever Satoshi is holding).  A huge dump wouldn't change anything except to further emphasize Bitcoin's volatility - which, again, everyone already knows.  As long as there wasn't some reason to believe that the Bitcoin network or protocol were somehow broken there would be millions of dollars pouring into exchanges attempting to purchase as many coins in the single and low double digits as possible because nothing about Bitcoin's existing utility or future potential would have changed.
I'm not saying it wouldn't suck and that there wouldn't be a lot of folks who would be scared off after that kind of volatility, but it certainly wouldn't be the end of Bitcoin's value.

In 2011 there was an extended period of time in the downward slide towards the bottom where you could re-accumulate BTC in large volumes.

I think it might have more to do with the fact that they're now a huge corporation and can't do anything to "rock the boat" - particularly with their banking partners that they rely on.

If you don't have large amounts of $/BTC to exchange then the other exchanges will work fine for you.

The potential downsides for WU are relatively small: if bitcoin fails somehow, then they were simply expanding their services into a new market that didn't work out at very little cost to integrate.
The potential upsides are astronomical for them: cementing their position as the go-to currency exchange across the world, reducing their costs, expanding their customer base, and essentially getting a small % of everything that developers are building on top of bitcoin as people need to go in and out of digital.

Pools provide "work" to the individual miner which consists of Bitcoin transaction data.  The individual miners then take the work, add some random data, create the hash, and only respond back to the pool if they've found a hash that meets the pool's difficulty target.
Hypothetically, if a pool operator needed to crack a SHA-256 hash that happened to be structured exactly like a bitcoin block (highly unlikely but you wanted hypothetical) they could provide specific work to the miners, set the difficulty very low so that they'd get all of the hashes back, then wait until they received back the hash they're trying to crack.  There are tons of problems with this, though:
* the data would have to look like Bitcoin transaction data and the pool operator wouldn't have control over the "random data" portion of the block that the miners generate themselves
* the pool operator would be spending immense amount of time and money on creating custom pool software and paying for the extra bandwidth/hardware to accept millions of hashes being reported back to them
* it would be easily detected by programmers or if it was done in a sloppy way that caused mining software to stop hashing.
* miners expect to be paid for their work, so you'd have to continue to pretend that you're finding real Bitcoin blocks and continue paying out BTC otherwise they'll leave
...so yes, something could hypothetically be done, but the something is so obscure and specific that any actual use outside of Bitcoin is unlikely.  Another thing to keep in mind that this could only happen if a pool operator went rogue and it would only impact that pool: Bitcoin as a whole wouldn't be impacted.  It'd be detected, people would start freaking out wondering what is going on with the pool, and the vast majority of miners would switch to another pool.

I'm not an expert, but there are all kinds of exceptions and allowances for what activities and amounts require registration.  According to the warrant they A. saw money transmitting activities and B. saw that the box wasn't checked on the corresponding bank account.  That is all it apparently took for them to completely seize the account.  I'm not saying that Gox shouldn't have known: I'm saying that I'd expect the government to take a little more care to confirm that there is, in fact, a violation before they potentially ruin someone's business.
The way that the warrant makes it sound Gox could have obtained their license but simply forgot to go back and update their bank account documents and still would have had their account confiscated.

If you make the calculation that a particular advancement in technology is going to disrupt your business then you either try to fight it (music industry approach which hasn't gone so well for them) or embrace it in the ways that you can.  Western Union obviously has a history of being able to pivot with technology and it seems that they're at least starting to make the decision that they should follow the route of embracing rather than fighting.

My guess is that you said something about "exchanging BTC to USD" in your email/application with them which made them think that you were setting up an exchange or were somehow converting currencies for your customers.  If you're just taking payment in BTC and need USD to pay for things, then you aren't doing the exchange yourself: Bitpay, Coinbase, or some other company is doing the actual conversion for you and THOSE companies need to get all that info together.
Note that IAFCU isn't an exchange: they are just a bank account like any other bank account.  They just happen to be considered "Bitcoin-friendly" because they helped out Bitfloor while other banks who don't understand Bitcoin are cancelling bank accounts for a small number of Bitcoin businesses that do large amounts of business in Bitcoin.  Once you have the business bank account you'll still need something that will accept your BTC and deposit USD into that bank account: BitPay, Coinbase, CampBX, etc.

1. Price would crash to 0 - or near 0 - because there isn't enough cash at the exchanges.
2. Panic
3. Once everyone realized that there wasn't anything wrong with Bitcoin itself, panic buying which would bring the price back up.
4. After the big spike back up, the price would return to pre-crash levels slowly as confidence is regained.
While it would be a huge black cloud hovering over Bitcoin for the short and medium term, Bitcoin would be stronger long term: less centralized (with Satoshi no longer controlling that many BTC), traders less afraid of huge dumps, etc.

They are only screwed if they didn't use Bitpay or do the proper risk calculation.  If you followed the advice of "only keep what you can afford to lose" you could figure out how much you could keep as BTC and convert the rest as necessary to cover your costs.  If you did this, you could have easily made enough profit on the run-up to cover the costs when the market went down.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:05:30
"only keep what you can afford to lose" means calculating for 100% loss on any BTC you haven't converted.  If they had done that (and any business not interested in gambling should have been) then they'd be fine right now.

No, there are many problems mainly having to do with:
1. You'd have to prove that the supposed addresses in the wallet are the addresses with the coins.  The wallet leaves the public keys and transactions unencrypted, but I don't believe there is any way to prove that the wallet wasn't faked.
2. You could be providing a copy of a wallet that you do have access to, wait a few days, and then take all the coins away from the person who paid to you try and crack it.
So you might get someone to bite, but they probably wouldn't offer you much at all for it - or there would have to be some additional trust/arrangement set up between the two of you.

Bitcoin is great - particularly for the poor - because it is a finite supply like gold, but can actually be used transactionally.  The poor are the hardest hit by inflation because they can't put the little money they have into things like gold or the stock market since they might need access to it at any point.  With Bitcoin they potentially have something that they can hold without it being constantly devalued, but can be used instantly as needed.

Can you confirm their assertion that you sent the money back to the address that you received coins from and not an actual deposit address they provided?
If not, then correct them.
If so, you did mess up and the fact that you can't prove ownership of the originating address complicates things further.  That said, it is highly unlikely that they'd destroy the private keys to their "outbound pool" addresses so they very likely are in control of the funds.  Theoretically all they'd have to do is confirm that the funds were sent from an address you control to an address they control and credit your account.  Since you admitted that you wouldn't be able to prove that you created that transaction and because they probably don't want to deal with the manual accounting adjustments, though, they're probably just saying the coins are "lost" instead of taking the time to fully explain the problem and truly confirm that ownership can't be proven.  It is disappointing customer service, but also hard to blame them.

You're just transferring funds from one address to another: no different than sending a payment to someone.  In this case, though, you happen to own both the input and output addresses.
If you don't transfer the funds, make sure you make a backup of the QT wallet because if your computer crashes part of the funds only exist in that wallet (in the change address).

The private off-chain transactions would have certain limitations/issues that the public blockchain doesn't: primarily issues of double spending.  Remember that the public blockchain is what prevents double spending with Bitcoin since everyone connected to the network knows the current state of each address.  The post describes a general way for Bitcoin to permit this kind of off-chain system verifiably and would allow others to come up with their own different implementations that could address these double spending problems however the participants feel comfortable with.  The 2 example implementations are to either have a trusted 3rd party oversee the transaction or to use a separate blockchain.

Not completely true: online sales tax in America is currently governed by old rulings which say that no state can force a company that is located somewhere else to collect their sales taxes.  Only if the company has a "nexus" (warehouse, sales people, an office, etc) in the state do they have to collect the tax.
This creates very weird incentives for businesses to locate their warehouses and offices in states with lower populations or in states that don't have sales tax so that the majority of customers making purchases aren't charged the sales tax.
So most online sales don't have sales tax, but if you purchase something from a company that is located in the same state you do.

Bitcoin isn't going to be stable any time soon.  It is a free, open market with a small number of participants, no market maker, and a relatively small market cap.  A single person with large personal wealth can single-handedly move the price 10% or more with ease.

They should be able to see that the transaction happened, but that it just hasn't been confirmed so hopefully they don't think you completely ripped them off.  If the transaction fails, though, you will have to resend (with fee this time).  Unless it was an extremely complicated transaction, though, it will likely confirm eventually.
There really isn't a way to force anything unless you were extremely knowledgeable about Bitcoin, exported your keys, and resent the transaction from another wallet with a fee.  This could cause a number of problems, though, so don't attempt unless you know what you're doing.

You are correct: brain wallet is 1 address (unless you create many - for example, adding a number at the end of your memorized phrase to create multiple) and electrum's seed is the key to generating many addresses
If you want easy access the coins then Electrum is probably your better bet.  Electrum's seed is specific to Electrum, but as long as you had a copy of the electrum software you would be able to export the private keys and import them into other clients (if, for example, all of the Electrum servers were taken down).

Blockchain stores a copy of your encrypted wallet.  When you go log into your wallet from their website what happens is that you get a copy of your encrypted wallet plus a bunch of code (javascript) that your browser uses to decrypt the wallet and do all of the wallet functions without the Blockchain servers ever knowing your password.  As you say, if someone were to gain access to the blockchain servers they couldn't do too much with the encrypted wallet files.  They could try to add their own code to the website, though, so that people logging into their wallets could have their keys stolen.
Using the browser plugins adds an extra layer of security.  With the browser extension, you're downloading all of the code directly to your browser instead of from their servers every time you visit the site.  You can then know when there are updates available for the extension and you can wait to update which should ensure that others checking the releases didn't find anything wrong with it.  With the verifier extension, your browser will try to check that the code being downloaded from the servers is OK when you visit the site and log into your wallet.

Correct.  They could try to crack your password which is why having a complex password is important (and why, if you know that someone got a hold of the file, you should move all your BTC to a new wallet).




You can install the bitcoin software again on a new computer and copy your backed-up wallet.dat into the bitcoin data directory.  You might have to resync/rescan, but you'll be able to proceed with making transactions again just like nothing happened as long as you have the password.
@_date: 2013-03-31 22:16:25
That is a lot of questions.


It encrypts the private keys in your wallet so that if someone gets the wallet.dat file they still can't use your funds (though they can still see what addresses you own).


it only needs your password when you want to send BTC somewhere because only the private keys are encrypted.  It can still keep track of your balances without those.


Make sure you don't have viruses or malware on your machine and that you chose a long, complicated password.


Yes.  In general don't delete but instead move the old wallet somewhere (just in case).


Just ways to tag addresses with info so you know what they were used for


The QT client pre-generates 100 addresses in your wallet and a new address is used for each transaction so you want to back the wallet up AT LEAST every 100 transactions you make (more frequently is better).


Bitcoin addresses are encryption keys.  If for some reason you needed to prove that you owned a certain address - or that a certain message you wanted to tell someone came from you, you can "sign" the message as coming from one of your bitcoin addresses.  Someone can then verify that the message came from your address by using "verify".

There is no comparison: the world has never seen something like this and people who simply look at the graph and yell "bubble" don't understand what is going on.

There are a number of stocks where one entity owns a majority - or stocks that have different classes so the average investor has little to no say in the operation of the company.  You could make the same silly claims in those cases: that the majority owner will simply dump their shares as soon as it reaches a point where they want to cash out and tank the price, that those running the company might do something stupid to tank the value of the stock, etc.  
Is there some risk, sure: but the risk is out in the open so it is already being factored into the value.  And in both cases, even if someone does something stupid the infrastructure still stands so it isn't any kind of "kill switch".

The OP did something wrong.  When you make a transaction with most desktop clients some of the transaction is transferred to a new change address within the same wallet.
