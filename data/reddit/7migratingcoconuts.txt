Bitcoin Core by default generates an initial keypool size of 100 "hidden" addresses that will be called whenever you press new address. I believe, although could be wrong, the keypool must be exhausted before it will generates more. Allowing you to stagger your backups to slightly less than every 100 new address requests/transactions.
100 is fairly low if you plan to frequently use your wallet. It's possible to raise the keypool to extend time between backups using the following command and setting it to a larger number such as 1000 or however many you prefer.
    -keypool=&lt;n&gt;

In the standard core client, you can get some basic information as well as enter console commands through the **debug window**.
Select Help&gt;debug window
You can get a list of available commands by entering "help" into the console.
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:00:24
    -keypool=&lt;n&gt;           Set key pool size to &lt;n&gt; (default: 100)    
Change the keypool to something much larger if you're concerned with frequency of backups. It can be anywhere in the thousands, tens of thousands, or more.
Keeping it lower, helps ensure you are refreshing your backups fairly often to protect against degradation and corruption of your backup medium.
To answer your initial question, the core client uses a "new" address every time you request a receiving address, or make a transaction that has unspent outputs (change address.) Using coin control options you can manually select a change address but it's recommend to allow default behavior.
Another option is to use a client besides bitcoin core wallet, and switch to one which uses a Hierarchical Determination wallet aka HD wallet. HD wallets generate new addresses based off a single seed meaning you only need to backup the seed once.

I would not have this enabled by default, it's a potential privacy disaster. A default "light wallet" for out of sync nodes would leak all pre-generated public addresses to peers every time it's launched. It needs to be off by default and a once per click query query option.
Having an option to query *select* addresses from peers when a node is out of sync would be nice. I'd imagine a small balance check option/button beside the sync progress but grayed out if less sync is less than 24 hours. Clicking it could pop out a list of all available receive addresses with a check box beside them allowing the user to select as many or as few addresses as they like.

I have not used them myself, but asking if they are "legit" is not a clean cut question. There is a difference between legitimacy and receiving a key that works. They are not affiliated with steam, or any publisher and their website lacks detail on any reseller partnerships they may have. The keys are likely obtained through grey markets and regional pricing.
If you support using sketchy grey markets and *exploiting* region pricing you may as well use  which accepts bitcoin.

The run up to and above $1000 was not led, or started by mtgox.
The supposed gox manipulation has been beaten like a dead horse with no real evidence one way or another. The willy report and other questionable bots, while not explained can easily be attributed to large private buyers and private contracts set to purchase overtime. These trading bots and algos occur in nearly every trade-able market especially those with low liquidity. 
The problem is that there is **no transparency** leaving everything to rumours, conspiracies, and speculation.
The price was driven primarily by sudden and extreme demand from coming out of China exchange.
mtgox price was usually higher because withdrawing fiat was always slower than other exchanges. Anyone wanting to quickly withdraw had to use their fiat to buy bitcoin, withdraw the bitcoin, and then sell it on a different or local exchange. This directly causes a higher buying and lower selling pressure.

Why not use the actual established units as used in bitcoin?
Units in bitcoin follow the SI metric prefix, a global standard of measurement used for centuries. The issue with using "bit" is that it abbreviates the wrong word from microbitcoin, millibitcoin, centibitcoin, decibitcoin. You abbreviate the prefix, not the unit, example being "mikes", or "millies" when spoken in shorthand. The only time you abbreviate the unit is when it follows the prefix. By omitting the prefix and abbreviating only the base unit the quantity is completely lost.
satoshi - sat - 100 millionth - .00000001
microbitcoin - microbit - ubit - µBTC - "mikes" - millionth - .000001
millibitcoin - millibit - mbit - mBTC - "millies" - thousandth - .001
centibitcoin - centibit - cbit - cBTC - "cents" - hundredth - .01
decibitcoin - decibit - dbit - dBTC - "decies" - tenth - .1
You can refer to the wiki when needed, decimal units as listed above are highlighted in blue   Other wikis with information on metric units in general can be found here    
Even the "dollar" uses the SI metric prefix "cent" for divisibility, and not "dols" or "lars". Add in triple zero or sub-penny stocks and you will start to see millidollars (one tenth of a cent).
You wouldn't shorten kilometer to "met" and you don't shorten microbitcoin to "bit."
Using "bit" creates confusion with the value of each unit as an abbreviation of bitcoin is bit. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 10:04:14
Dollars &amp; cents... only helps to validate my previous post. Even the "dollar" uses the SI metric prefix "cent" for divisibility, and not "dols" or "lars". Abbreviated from centidollar to the commonly referred cent. Add in triple zero or sub-penny stocks and you will start to see millidollars (one tenth of a cent).
No one is forcing you to use decibit, centibit, millibit, or microbit units based on the quantity. Using 200000 satoshis instead of using 2000 microbits, or 2 millibits is fine. You can use the units you choose, it's about calling them by their rightful name and following the international standard that has been used for centuries.
@_date: 2014-10-21 21:22:15
No one writes "kilo dollar" because it's been shortened to the symbol "k" as once again in $10k.
There are no "milli dollars" because the dollar doesn't divide below two decimal places. Oddly enough the metric prefix for two decimal places is "centi" cents, not "lars" as would be the "bit" equivalent. It almost makes sense.

Using BIP 38, password encrypted paper wallets. Send to the public address, then remove/destroy the public key keeping only the encrypted private key.

They already do.
The abbreviation "bit" is short for bitcoin.
*taken from a previous post of mine, context may not make perfect sense*




Using a prefix of "bit" is abbreviating the wrong part of the denomination. The "bit" in microbitcoin is shorthand for the full unit bitcoin, not the quantity of sub-units. It doesn't sound cool, it doesn't make sense on any scale, and it's definitely not the "right size".
@_date: 2014-11-06 14:53:25
Watch for sales. There seems to be great hidden deals every month or so. Best of all, nearly all the VPS providers accept bitcoin.
There's really only a couple things you need to look for in order to run a full node, 512mb ram (with swap, or 1gb), and 50gb+ hdd to allow for blockchain expansion. All other specs are likely to handle a node with no issue.
If you find a good deal, I wouldn't recommend advertising it as many nodes in a single data center signing up at the same time can create some centralization.

Wrong, it's millibitcoin, you don't capitalize the "b". Using just the prefix milli work just fine. "*bits*" on the other hand is completely wrong, both in context and practice. Not only are units lower than millibitcoins unnecessary for average prices of their products at this time, but "*bit*" isn't a unit or a correct abbreviation for one.
The issue with using "bit" is that it abbreviates the wrong word from microbitcoin, millibitcoin, centibitcoin, decibitcoin, etc. You abbreviate the prefix, not the unit, example being "mikes", or "millies" when spoken. Other examples for microbitcoin include any form of the abbreviated or not prefix +/- bit/bitcoin. This can include but is not limited to micros, mikes, mics, µBTC, µbit, µbitcoin, uBTC, ubit, ubitcoin, mubit, mcbit mubitcoin, mcbitcoin, etc.
The only time you abbreviate the unit is when it follows the prefix with microbit, or millibit. By omitting the prefix and abbreviating only the base unit the quantity is completely lost.

That's part of the argument I'm making. Saying "kilos" instead of "kilograms" uses the prefix to define the quantity and is correct in this situation. It's not trying to use "gra" or similar as an *alias* for kilogram in the way "bit" supporters do for microbitcoin.
The *alias* for microbitcoin is not "bit" rather, it's any form of the abbreviated or not prefix +/- bit/bitcoin. Such as microbit, ubit, mcbit, mubit, µbit, µBTC, micros, mics (pronounced like "mikes.")
Adding something as simple as a "u", or "µ" as a prefix to "bit" solves nearly every issue I see with an *alias*, slang, abbreviation, shorthand, etc for microbitcoin.

@_date: 2014-10-14 06:00:22
It's easy to forget just how far we've come in such a short amount of time. Without mentioning the price, a message to the past about current bitcoin liquidity on exchanges would make it seem like adoption never happened. $100 from a few years ago is enough to move the market today.
That's what I like about the quote. It acts as a little reminder that the world is changing at an incredible pace and very few realize it.

It's no surprise that there's a potential drop coming. Butterfly Labs "raid" coincided with the loss of about 12 - 20 Petahashes on the network (possibly more). I don't think this is a coincident, this hashrate was likely from their "testing facility".
This will give current mining hardware a couple extra weeks before it goes even further obsolete. It can also be used as an opportunity by ASIC manufactures to pump out a few extra units by showing that the difficulty is no longer on a constant rise. Doing so could spike production and sales, pushing the difficulty back up to new heights.
The hashrate has not hit a final peak, it may be a temporary slump of a couple difficulty adjustments. But as other manufacturers build and bring new ASICs online, the loss of BFL's hashrate will be a short lived memory.
The better question to ask would be; What's going to happen to BFL "testing facility"? Will the hardware be liquidated pending criminal charges? If so, when? The hardware will be constantly lowering in value, to get the most out of it they need to be sold off as soon as possible.

The push for "bits" is incorrect and misguided as it's abbreviating the wrong prefix. The correct abbreviation would be micro's. Bit would be the prefix for Bitcoin only.

The relationship between hashrate and price is currently difficult to chart. The hashrate will continue to outpace the price of bitcoin until max silicon efficiency is found and readily accessible. Until then, expect ASICs to continue in both mass production, and higher efficiencies pushing the difficulty and hashrate up exponentially.
The big question is, will we see the exponential curve start to level out this year. Or will we see another large 248x increase?

Is coinbase a *safe* way to store coins? No.
They are a centralized company that retains complete control over your keys.
If you don't control your keys, you don't control your Bitcoins.
How to store your coins safely depends on how you want to use them. Frequently used coins can be stored in a local hot storage (wallet on device connected to internet), while majority of funds should remain in cold storage.

That quote from Gavin is a little out of context, I hate seeing it pop up every time someone mentions running a node. It's directed towards the average non technical Joe. It's not geared towards readers of this subreddit at all.
Every knowledgeable user of Bitcoin should really be running a full node or at least maintaining a local copy of the blockchain. Personally I run more than a few nodes. The requirements are low, it's easy to set up, and the bandwidth footprint is far less than expected and manageable.
Instead of donating to nodes individually, why not set one up yourself locally or on a VPS? For $20 a **year** you can run a node on a VPS. If that's too much work, tip me $20 and I'll pay for the VPS to set up another node for year. Bitcoin node hosting could potentially become a DAC.
@_date: 2014-09-20 12:42:36
It ranges from day to day, but it's rather low and non-disruptive to other bandwidth consuming devices.
You can expect a few GB per day on average, depending on internet speed and number of connections you get with your node.
I would recommend using a QOS bandwidth priority tool to prevent the node from having spikes which can cause lag in skype or online gaming. Due to the low specs you can run also run full node on a $20 per year VPS.

Thank you very much for the 500 microbits. It will go towards a year of hosting a full node.
It's not too late, and majority of the "momentum" is fake or misunderstood.
Let me start by saying how difficult it has been to have a constructive discussion on this topic. Even the most mundane mention towards the use of “bit” as a unit instantly gets upvoted; While negative, or subjectively controversial comments get downvoted into oblivion. The act of abusing downvotes to avoid discussion, suppress opposing opinions, or give the appearance of a vocal majority is nothing new. Manipulation through votes is an issue every subreddit faces.
This is not the way reddit is intended to work, and it's rather appalling to see it happen here time and time again.
There's nothing wrong with pushing for the use of millibitcoins, or microbitcoins as the default. Trying to change the name of established units and denominations based on well understood global standards is what causes issues.
@_date: 2014-11-13 09:40:40
"bit" was derived as an abbreviation of the long established unit microbitcoin by incorrectly abbreviating the base unit, and not the prefix. 
Hence the comparison applying the same logic to kilometer gives you "met." Perhaps kilometer was a poor choice, instead we can use micrometer, millimeter, centimeter, or decimeter. All of which would be abbreviated to "met." By omitting the prefix and abbreviating only the base unit the quantity is completely lost.

As with nearly every algorithm, a weakness is discovered long before it's found to be broken. These cryptographic algorithms generally aren't broken, but weakness can lead to an attacker having a slight advantage in brute force. Which is far from the end of the bitcoin.
SHA256 is prevalent in our everyday lives much more than anyone thinks. If SHA256 was suddenly broken, bitcoin would be the least of the worlds worries. Everything from banks, communications, to nuclear launch codes could be at risk.
Worst case and the blockchain gets obliterated by some flaw, it can be reverted to a state just prior of the attack assuming it's noticed quick enough. Even with broken sha256, you can't spend someone else's bitcoin, or go back in time and change things unnoticed. A "freeze" of the blockchain would be effective while patches are made and no one would lose anything.

Micro is too small for common fiat denominations; however milli, centi, and in some cases deci are in use. I guess you've never heard of, or traded triple zero or sub-penny stocks which make use of millidollars/millieuros and such.
It's a good thing centi was never used for money, think of the confusion that would cause... oh wait. 
By your logic of "bits," and applying that to the euro or dollar would not result in cent, rather we would be using "dol" or "lars," "eur," or "uro" for hundredth units.

There's no reason not to use the Bitcoin core QT reference client. I recommend the Bitcoin core QT over any "light" spv wallet excluding mobile devices. 
If you're looking to increase your security further, check out armory which offers the highest standards for bitcoin based security and it requires local access to the full blockchain. 
You can also turn the QT into a full node and give back to the network by forwarding port 8333. If you do this, check to see that you're accepting incoming connections. 
If by "upgrading" you mean to say you're running on an outdated version of that wallet then yes you should upgrade based on how old it is. Very old clients may use higher fees, have stability issues, or not work with the current network (hard fork).

And don't forget the amount people tend to tip are called microbitcoins not "bits". For reference µBTC, ubit, mubit, microbits, micros, "mikes" are all acceptable abbreviations/slang. Amounts larger than 1000 microbits are millibits. You can learn more on decimal units used in bitcoin here  
The issue with using "bit" is that it abbreviates the wrong word from microbitcoin, millibitcoin, centibitcoin, decibitcoin. You abbreviate the prefix, not the unit, example being "mikes", or "millies" when spoken in shorthand. The only time you abbreviate the unit is when it follows the prefix.
microbit - ubit -"mikes"
millibit - mbit - "millies"
centibit - cbit - "cents"
decibit - dbit - "decies"
Even the "dollar" uses the SI metric prefix "cent" for divisibility, and not "dols" or "lars". Add in triple zero or sub-penny stocks and you will start to see millidollars (one tenth of a cent).
You don't shorten kilometer to "met" and you don't shorten microbitcoin to "bit"

First lets start with typing µ. Press and hold ALT then type 230 on your numpad, release ALT. This can be done for all sorts of "secret" key combinations.
Every site dealing in Bitcoin should offer their users the choice to display as many, or as little decimal places as they like. A simple drop down listing many of the denominations already exists across many sites.
millibit, microbit, centibit, decibit - All of those correctly abbreviate the word bitcoin and maintain proper use of the prefix. There is absolutely nothing wrong with those. The problem occurs with trying to use bit, an abbreviation of bitcoin as the prefix unit which doesn't work.

No. Stop trying to force "bits" it's an inherently flawed naming choice and breaks the currently established units used in bitcoin. Do not spam changetip or any company/business with emails complaining about their lack of default "bit". By default changetip aggregates tips by quantity keeping everything looking nice and clean. You received 2.5 millibitcoin, is cleaner than 2500 microbitcoins or 250000 satoshis.
If this is something you don't want to see, go into your settings and change the default view to display in only microbitcoins. There is absolutely no reason to email them demanding their default display settings be changed.

Nobody knows for sure who got the bitcoins in the end, there was, and is zero transparency.
It was complete and utter incompetence that led to it's demise. From constant crashes to an auto refill "leaking" cold storage (hint: cold storage doesn't leak).
The list of issues was long, and well known/warned. Their solvency had been questioned since the 2011 flash crash/hack, and again after their US dwolla account was seized, and coinlab lawsuit. Yet people still continued to use the platform despite all the warning signs.

"bit" is one of **the** worst unit denominations you could use. Bitcoin uses the SI metric prefixes known *around the world* as a global standard.
These unit prefixes are:
Micro - μBTC - microbitcoin - 0.000001 - Millionth
Milli - mBTC - millibitcoin - 0.001 - Thousandth
Centi - cBTC - centibitcoin - 0.01 - Hundredth 
Deci - dBTC - decibitcoin - 0.1 - Tenth
"bit" is short for Bitcoin and nothing else as bitcoin is the base whole unit. The prefix for the millionth unit is "micro", "microbitcoin", or "microbit" but never "bit" on it's own unless using it short for bitcoin. This works for all units from millibits to decibits to centibits as well.
A bit is not a unit.

Pick up a small used laptop and install linux. Preferably you can find one with a damaged display or other cosmetic damage to get it even cheaper. The age and cpu power for the most part won't matter a 10 year old laptop is powerful enough. Primarily you want 1gb ram and 80gb hdd, both of which are larger than what's currently needed. The only reason you may want a more recent device would be better power consumption, although running a node won't stress anything too hard keeping power consumption fairly low across the board.
Buying *new* Pi-like computer/hardware to only run a full node is overkill, much cheaper and faster options exist.

It's guerrilla advertising. Nothing to be concerned or worried about, there is nothing that could be compromised from this.
By spamming dust to random addresses, the confused receivers take to posting questions about it, generating more views. Looking into the address will lead to scams, gambling sites, phishing attempts, malware, or whatever else someone may want to advertise. It's highly recommended not to follow any links that are being spread around.
The addresses are obtained by watching the blockchain and automatically compiling a list of addresses recently used.
The only issue you may have in the future, if these transactions get confirmed is spending them. The amount is too low and will require a substantial fee compared to the amount. Most wallets have a coin control feature allowing you to manually include or exclude various inputs for your transactions mitigating this minor issue completely.

Why not set up an armory offline wallet. It's pretty much top of the line for security when it comes to cold storage management, offline transaction signing, multisig, etc.
it also requires and makes use of a local copy of the blockchain on the online wallet (no relying on other services/servers.)
An automated system which opens a communication channel to send/receive data and sign transactions could be exploited and may break cold storage causing it to leak. (mtgox had an automated system to pull out of cold storage.) When it comes to protecting and storing bitcoins you want to avoid automation and keep yourself in the loop as much as possible to verify each step.

It's the use of fear to influence opinion of the general public, I'd say that's pretty much the definition of fear mongering. These "500 million financial records" is a speculative number with no proof behind it or the timeframe in question. Many of the hacks we are hearing about now took place prior to their 6 or 12 month timeframe. They only just made it to the mainsteam news recently. I'm not saying these hacks did not occur, they most certainly did, but they are being spun in such a way to enforce negative overreaching changes in law.
This is an ad to support the *need* for them to have complete warrantless access to backdoors in every device and service.
Right now, if the FBI mentions anything about hacking or theft it's to persuade the public into agreeing with their argument that privacy and encryption without backdoors is bad and must be made illegal.
The article read like a list of "here's why we need ban privacy and market encryption as a weapon."

Litecoin has it's place as one of, if not the top Altcoin for various reasons. One of those reasons is __*not*__ it's faster confirmations.
Security in Bitcoin, and nearly every other altcoin is measured in proof of work and time, not confirmations.
To obtain the same level of security as one confirmation in bitcoin, litecoin requires 4 confirmations. Waiting 6 confirmations in bitcoin for a truly irreversable transaction would need 24 equivalent litecoin blocks.
This is the same for every coin with faster block times. Example being, with 5 second blocks you would need to wait 120 confirmations to get roughly the same security offered by 1 10 minute confirmation.
Transactions propagate to 51% of the network almost instantly (within a second or two).
Keep in mind, I'm not against litecoin in the slightest and would prefer it to be on the list; but you're argument of faster confirmations being a positive feature is a fallacy. It's an illusion of a faster system, nothing more.
If you wanted to make a real push for litecoin, go to the payment processors such as bitpay, coinbase, etc and ask for support to be added. Asking for alt coins at the merchant level won't work, unless they code their own processing platform what coins they accept will be up to the processor. It's also possible to recommend merchants use coinkite, gocoin, or other processors which already accept multiple coins.

The issue with "bit" is that it abbreviates the wrong word from microbitcoin, millibitcoin, centibitcoin, decibitcoin. You abbreviate the prefix, not the unit, example being "mikes", or "millies" when spoken in shorthand. The only time you abbreviate the unit is when it follows the prefix.
microbit - ubit -"mikes"
millibit - mbit - "millies"
centibit - cbit - "cents"
decibit - dbit - "decies"
Just like all those currencies you listed using the "dollar" they also use the metric prefix cent for divisibility, and not "dols" or "lars". Add in triple zero or sub-penny stocks and you will start to see millidollars (one tenth of a cent).

That NUC would be more than capable. It doesn't include hdd, or ram which will add to the bottom cost of getting it running.
If you're looking to run a node on the cheap, you can easily pick up a cheap used laptop. Look for ones with broken/damaged monitors as you can the run node completely headless.
A full node can be run on pretty much anything, the specs/requirements are very low. At the very low end of hardware your node may be slightly slower in being first to propagate blocks but it will still function normally and help the network.
You can also consider purchasing a year of cheap VPS for $20 or less that will run a full node with ease.

Each block is individually downloaded then locally verified. The blocks are downloaded sequentially from only 1 peer at a time, not multiple.
The constant start/stop for downloading and verifying is one of the reasons for a slower syncing process. The bootstrap is a file which contains the entire blockchain up until a few weeks ago (21gb). Your client still has to go through and verify each block one at a time, but it doesn't have to wait for it to download.
Torrents can be downloaded at much higher speeds because they allow you to download their contents from many peers at once. This enables you to, based on the number of seeds, reach your max isp speed.
Using the Bootstrap can be quicker, though you have already put 4 days into syncing. To answer your question of "is this normal, and should I just continue", the answer is yes, it can take quite a while to sync a full node/client. It should say at the bottom of the core window how far along you are. There's a couple things that can be done *beforehand* to speed up the process. Using the bootstrap file and a syncing on a faster processor will verify blocks quicker.

Proper storage/use prevents private key theft and bitcoin loss.
You act like irreversible theft isn't possible with fiat. You don't leave a wallet holding large amounts of fiat outside on a bench unattended. Just like you don't leave large amounts of bitcoin in an unsecured wallet/private key. Securing bitcoin requires people to think a little bit differently when it comes to digital security methods. There are extremely safe secure storage methods that are both easy to set up and available to all. Ignorance in security and protecting your data is not a failure of bitcoin.

Why not use the actual established units as used in bitcoin?
Units in bitcoin follow the SI metric prefix, a global standard of measurement used for centuries. The issue with using "bit" is that it abbreviates the wrong word from microbitcoin, millibitcoin, centibitcoin, decibitcoin. You abbreviate the prefix, not the unit, example being "mikes", or "millies" when spoken in shorthand. The only time you abbreviate the unit is when it follows the prefix.
satoshi - sat - 100 millionth - .00000001
microbit - ubit - µBTC - "mikes" - millionth - .000001
millibit - mbit - mBTC - "millies" - thousandth - .001
centibit - cbit - cBTC - "cents" - hundredth - .01
decibit - dbit - dBTC - "decies" - tenth - .1
You can refer to the wiki when needed, decimal units as listed above are highlighted in blue   Other wikis with information on metric units in general can be found here    
Even the "dollar" uses the SI metric prefix "cent" for divisibility, and not "dols" or "lars". Add in triple zero or sub-penny stocks and you will start to see millidollars (one tenth of a cent).
You wouldn't shorten kilometer to "met" and you don't shorten microbitcoin to "bit."

1 BTC = 1 hundred centibitcoins

No, bitcoins are 100% fungible. The introduction of any sort of blacklist would not only be non-enforceable, but would do more damage than make some coins worth less than others. A currency that is not fungible immediately fails.
It's recommended to mix coins and use as many anonymity tools as possible.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with using the bitcoin core QT. I'd recommend it over all of the "light" wallets with mobile wallets being the exception.
There are couple things you can do to speed it up.
Use the bootstrap file, which allows you to pre-download a recent copy of the blockchain then import it.  This can help, although it's still time consuming as each block has to be imported, verified, and checked prior to moving onto the next.
Manually override the amount of connections and specify a connection to a couple known good node. This can remove all orphan block spam (likely part cause of slow sync). Make sure you specify nodes that you can trust. Create a bitcoin.conf file and add




After your qt has synced, close it and remove maxconnections. This method is generally not recommended as it puts you at risk of accepting whatever those limited connections send to you. Do not make any transactions or trust what you see with only one or two connections.
Finally, you can try using the headers first build of the qt which will immensely speed up syncing.  Headers first will be making it's way into the next version, but until then you can use the recent test builds. If you choose to try the headers first build, make sure you are not limiting your connections.

SI metric prefixes is a *global* standard, sounds like American issues to me. This isn't about using a 1 millionth unit or not, it's about the name of said unit which is microbitcoin. Abbreviate it as ubit, micros, mikes, microbits, etc but not "bit."

Assuming you don't have a 10 keyless keyboard. Hold ALT, type 230 on number pad, release alt. Just because a keyboard doesn't have a specific key, it doesn't mean it can't be typed. 
There are many keyboards which do have µ as a dedicated key/alt key.
Even if you don't want to use the correct µ in typing or pronunciation, using "u" is generally acceptable. Similarly how µtorrent is more often than not, referred to and spoken as utorrent. 
microbitcoin can be expressed as ubit, µbit, uBTC, µBTC, ubitcoin, µbitcoin, micros, "mikes", etc. Just about any abbreviation of the micro prefix alone or followed by bitcoin, bit, BTC.

μBTC - microbitcoin. Shorthand or "slang" would be "micros" or "microbits" or even "ubit". Bit in and of itself cannot be the prefix as it's part of the unit bitcoin which applies to all denominations. This works for millibits, mbits/mBTC, centibits, cbits/dBTC, decibits, dbits/dBTC as well.

The "*foundation*" can fuck right off with this one. They are a centralized institution with little to no say over the global direction of Bitcoin. They hold no authority.
The unit denominations are simple and easy to understand. Bitcoin follows the Metric SI unit scale, a standard used around the world and understood by the vast majority of the educated population.
The sub bitcoin unit prefixes are, Micro, Milli, Centi, Deci, and Satoshi for the smallest unit. Most of these prefixes date back and have been used since the 1790's.
The push to change the units is mislead by in large Americans who are the globally the odd ones out when it comes to not adopting or understanding the metric system. The general ignorance when it comes to global scales and pushing a "$1.00" type denomination is sickening. Not everyone in the world uses a dollar and cents scale.
Bitcoin is regulated and secured by cryptography and math. Not some unelected bureaucratic group calling themselves *the foundation.* Bitcoin denominations are logical, mathematically correct, and use a globally accepted scale. Enforcing a change at the protocol level would be a devastating blow to global understanding and adoption.
For a "consensus based process" they do not have my vote for this change, or my confidence in them to remain competent in future decisions regarding Bitcoin adoption.

Currently running 4 nodes. Helping to maintain the network and keeping a local copy of the blockchain is more than enough incentive. It's also relatively cheap on average $20 a year for a VPS.
The resource impact of running a full node is low, more awareness to run a node is all that's needed. Many people still believe the only way to help the network is by mining.
Instead of incentivizing full nodes, set up a DAC which based on donations could set up new yearly nodes each time it acquires bitcoin to purchase additional servers.

If someone said decicents, I would have to correct them immediately as it's incorrect to double down on prefixes. This was disallowed back with the introduction of the international system of units.
There are no microdollars, as we simply don't divide the dollar down to millionths. We do however divide it to thousandths on occasion, and use millidollars (tenth of a cent). You can find these in triple zero or sub-penny stocks.
decicents are not an actual unit, but decidollars are. Commonly called dimes, originating from the latin decima meaning tenth.
If I attempt to modify your question to ask how many microdollars are in a decidollar, the answer is 100,000. It's easy to calculate in your head by moving the decimal place. decidollar is 0.1 dollar microdollar would be 0.000001 dollar. Base 10 makes it very easy to switch between prefix units.

Every new startup should be seen with extreme skepticism. Trust and respect is earned over time, not brought on by marketing PR and hype. An example of this would be Neo &amp; Bee, marketing and hype brought people in. After-which they were quickly separated from their money.

If you want it to be successful, use the actual units as used in bitcoin.
Units in bitcoin follow the SI metric prefix, a global standard of measurement used for centuries. The issue with using "bit" is that it abbreviates the wrong word from microbitcoin, millibitcoin, centibitcoin, decibitcoin. You abbreviate the prefix, not the unit, example being "mikes", or "millies" when spoken in shorthand. The only time you abbreviate the unit is when it follows the prefix.
satoshi - sat - 100 millionth - .00000001
microbit - ubit - µBTC - "mikes" - millionth - .000001
millibit - mbit - mBTC - "millies" - thousandth - .001
centibit - cbit - cBTC - "cents" - hundredth - .01
decibit - dbit - dBTC - "decies" - tenth - .1
You can refer to the wiki when needed, decimal units as listed above are highlighted in blue  
Other wikis with information on metric units in general can be found here    
Even the "dollar" uses the SI metric prefix "cent" for divisibility, and not "dols" or "lars". Add in triple zero or sub-penny stocks and you will start to see millidollars (one tenth of a cent).
You wouldn't shorten kilometer to "met" and you don't shorten microbitcoin to "bit."
Using "bit" creates confusion with the value of each unit as an abbreviation of bitcoin is bit.

Because there are no patterns ;) Don't be fooled by randomness. It's human nature to see patterns in chaos, and making decisions based on those "patterns" further feeds into the chaos. 
Rationalizing randomness by searching for seemingly non-random sequences of repeating patterns is what we do best. Flipping a coin a hundred times will result in the appearance of patterns where there are none.

No it is not safe, advised, or recommended to leave your coins in the full control of a third party. There are no banks in bitcoin, only companies pretending to be.
coinbase and circle are not banks nor are they regulated like a bank and they shouldn't be treated like one. Essentially you are handing stacks of cash to a random person on the street with the assumption that they not only trustworthy but capable of protecting your money and will give it back when you ask.
If you have a printer, you can securely and easily store your bitcoins on bip38 encrypted paper wallets. Instructions to do so are as complex as downloading code to generate paper wallets, and a linux distro then booting into it with your network cable unplugged.
The recent hacks and security problems are exactly why you shouldn't trust a third party to manage or generate your keys. It's not a reason to use them.

Privacy tools such as coin mixing services are essential to maintain and protect the rights of individuals, consumers, and protect trade secrets.
It's not so much about anonymity or hiding illegal activity, as it is about financial privacy. Bitcoin is *completely* transparent to the same effect that purchasing a coffee would allow the barista to look at your entire financial history and future. If the business used only a single public address, anyone watching could monitor not only the business's financials but that of customers coming in. By monitoring a static address, a potential "bad actor" could easily watch and identify high value targets without ever entering the business.
Likewise many businesses choose (and on some legal level, are required) to keep both client, and company financials private and hidden from the public, or competitors looking for an advantage.

Tagging an address has nothing to do with bitcoin itself or the owner of an address.
It's a "feature" offered by some services that allows anyone to create a "tag" and tie it to a transaction or address. This is often abused to create advertising spam on high traffic addresses.

Why would you want to use coinbase? I'd recommend avoiding them or any other custodial wallet service. You risk a lot more than you gain with using them to store coins. If you're looking for a way to safely store your bitcoin, you really can't beat cold storage 
Here's a website which lists regional exchanges. The one you choose depends on your situation and amount you want to buy. 
Sites like localbitcoins.com allow you to find local traders which help to keep you anonymous but at a cost. Larger exchanges tend to require verification but have more liquidity and market prices. Before you send money or personal information, take the time to look into recent reviews to make sure others aren't experiencing problems.

You can't use BIP38 to encrypt a public key. At least not in a way that would allow you to send bitcoins to it while it's encrypted (as far as I know). You could always remove the public key entirely when you store your bitcoin. The public key is derived from the private key, you only need the private key to gain access to your bitcoin. Print off your paper wallets with BIP38 like normal, send bitcoin to them, then tear off and destroy the public key ensuring the encrypted private key is intact.
You may also be looking for something like a stealth address 
Stealth addresses are still rather unfriendly towards end-users. With time and further development, we will see more wallets and ease of use tools adding support.
You can try the alpha version of dark wallet and their stealth address implementation  (unstable and not recommended for real-world use)

They damn well better let them get channeled through the exchange process. Watch for the verified details of the suspected perpetrator and report AML KYC. Do not reject, withhold, freeze or otherwise refuse the bitcoins based on their past transactions. Fungibility does not discriminate on the origin of the coins nor is their any bias in the blockchain. Exchanges are meant to provide a service of buyer/seller matching, not to become liability in policing what coins are valid based on their moral view.
Implementing blacklists and destroying fungibility in such a way will not only lead to foot in the door policies but could become the standard for censorship.

Sure, if you think regulatory capture, censorship, mining federations controlled by government, and re-organized/centralized/supervised development of Bitcoin to "GovCircleCoin" is not against the core of Bitcoin.
At the same time I agree, you're not wrong. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, views, and outlook on the future of Bitcoin. I welcome people to share them and explain how in their mind it can change the world. But do expect criticism from those with conflicting views. I often project my views into things I'm passionate about too.
I still standby my comment about Allaire being a wolf in sheep clothing. He doesn't want to adapt Bitcoin, he want's to change it completely from the ground up, and not for the greater good. He and Circle did make a statement in regards to the bit license proposal, though it may have been done more so to please the community than anything else. It is nearly what he asked for during the senate hearings.
A little bit more on topic. If we are not harsh on failures of companies, whether from incompetence, poor planning/management, or theft. What's to stop the people who would too easily be forgotten from repeating the same mistake and preying on a new crowd of Bitcoin newbies? Imagine the uproar if karpeles launched a new Bitcoin exchange, or Danny Brewster wants to do another round of funding for a new IPO. There are many valid reasons to remain harsh on these types of situations.

I agree, it's a similar risk to restaurants allowing you to pay after you eat.

The downside to my suggestion, is that it potentially risks revealing the private key if you need to re-create the public key for any reason. If you want to check/verify the balance, or add more bitcoins you will need to know the public key.
When re-creating the public key, follow the same safety measures you did when creating the private keys. Offline, linux live, etc. It might even be easier to sweep into a new paper wallet instead.
I'd recommend setting up a watch-only wallet so you always know the balance and have public key readily available if needed. This comes with it's downside too. Even though you can't spend from a watch-only, it leads back to the original issue of not wanting anyone to know your total balance if your watch-only device becomes compromised.

As unfortunate as it is to lose such a large amount, nothing can be nor should be done to forcibly have the coins returned or otherwise "seized" from current holders. Contacting exchanges to track the address is no different than asking them to implement blacklists. This is harsh, and you likely don't want to hear this, but Those coins are gone. Find, then fix your security issues and move on. You may be better off using p2pool instead of running your own private pool. 
At the very most, they can watch for the verified details of the suspected perpetrator and report AML KYC. Do not reject, withhold, freeze or otherwise refuse the bitcoins based on their past transactions.

Use multiple wallets across multiple platforms.
You will be much more secure using a wallet designed for each platform than a single wallet designed for convenience over security. I cannot stress enough that relying on a single wallet will lead to trouble eventually.
Multiple wallets/storage methods will divide your risk. Instead of having a single point of failure for &lt; 5 BTC, you have two separate wallets with &lt; 2.5. If you lose access to one you still have half your spending cash.

It uses the standard metric prefixes... It's sort of a globally accepted standard for units denominations. This is not a foreign system to anyone outside of america.
Bitcoin is a governed not by man, but by the principles of math and cryptography. The unit denominations should continue to follow that by using a set, and globally accepted mathematical scale. Not some arbitrary name system because it "sounds good for marketing". 
You don't need to dumb down the terminology, in the same way you don't have to de-risk the world and play to the nanny state mentality.

There is absolutely no personal, identifiable, or sensitive financial data transmitted during a transaction. This directly means:
* No identity theft
* No fraudulent charges
* No hidden fees that can be charged later 
* No cache of personal data held by merchants waiting to be exploited by a hacker (target, home depot, etc)
That's just to name a few. Bitcoin is push, not not pull so no one can authorize a payment except the holder of the private key.
Additionally on your remark about paypal being "faster", I'd argue it isn't. When you make a payment or transaction in Paypal, what's instant is a "paypal token" on their central ledger. It can take weeks for full settlement of that transaction to go through the clearing house and regulations. During which time and even afterwards can instantly be pulled from the receivers account. Bitcoin does full irrefutable settlement within a single confirmation (10 minutes), a "token" that represents a transaction (unconfirmed transaction) is instant in Bitcoin as well, propagating the entire network in less than a couple seconds.

No, I highly advise *against* storing bitcoins with Coinbase, Circle, or any other custodial wallet provider, centralized service, or off-chain solution. That's half the problem of the lazy security people use, if you don't control the keys the bitcoins are not yours.

In my opinion, the issue and part cause of the "aggressive" evangelism in Bitcoin is two fold.
First, there is no central Bitcoin company or lead PR team behind marketing. Because of this, any and all information, advertising, or education is directly funded by it's users and the people willing to be active and get involved.
Second, not many people are marketing or PR geniuses, this can often lead to misled aggressive approaches and apparent biased evangelism. This is something that does not normally occur in centralized networks or companies as they have hired teams specialized to avoid those sorts of situations.
When you adopt Bitcoin, you also adopt the unorganized, decentralized guerrilla advertising that comes with it. It may be unorthodox, and unprofessional at times, but it's what we've got. The take away from this is to remember no one is paid by "Bitcoin the company" to manage or head the marketing and PR team. Every bit of advertising done in this space is a result of someone being passionate about the technology.

Bitcoin core and armory.  
They take up a decent amount of space but offer the best security, and a complete feature set. HDD space shouldn't be much of a concern if this is a desktop wallet. Having a local copy of the blockchain also allows you to query and create custom api's without needing to use central block explorer sites. 
If you like you could also forward port 8333 to turn your bitcoin core wallet into a full node and help give back to the network.
At the moment, bitcoin core will take a very long time to sync. The next update will include headers first syncing allowing the blockchain to be downloaded much faster. You can try out the headers first test builds here. 
Other options of speeding up the core sync include using the bootstrap file (a pre-download of the blockchain which can be imported quicker)

It's guerrilla advertising. Nothing to be concerned or worried about, there is nothing that could be compromised from this.
By spamming dust to random addresses, the confused receivers take to posting questions about it. Looking into the address will lead to scams, gambling sites, or whatever else someone may want to advertise.
The addresses are obtained by watching the blockchain and automatically compiling a list of addresses recently used.
The only issue you may have in the future, if these transactions get confirmed is spending them. The amount is too low and will require a substantial fee compared to the amount. Most wallets have a coin control feature allowing you to manually include or exclude various inputs for your transactions mitigating this minor issue completely.

You can not separate the blockchain and the bitcoin "token" incentive used to maintain the distributed, decentralized, consensus platform. The blockchain invention *solves* the byzantine generals problem through its carefully balanced incentive structure.

That's just an old quote from a year ago, I use it because I found it amusing and fairly relevant if not clever with a slight tongue in cheek tone use of common metric measurements.
I would beg to differ though, anyone with a highschool/secondary school education would have studied even basic SI measurements smaller than milli and larger giga. This is the same with basic to mid level algebra and how it's taught. While many simply forget it over the years from not using it, they did still learn it at one point. The issue become retaining what was previously taught. With more prevalent use that issue solves itself. 
SI units are rather intuitive using a base 10 system, remembering the order of a the few names can allow anyone to quickly and easily identify quantities.

No, it really isn't.
I'm assuming you never learnt the metric system? AKA American. Using a prefix of "bit" is abbreviating the wrong part of the denomination. The "bit" in microbitcoin is shorthand for the full unit bitcoin, not the quantity of sub-units. It doesn't sound cool, it doesn't make sense on any scale, and it's definitely not the "right size".

Bitcoin allows me to make purchases with the knowledge that my identity cannot be stolen, or additional charges and fees applied. Unlike credit, or debit cards there's no sensitive data stored or transmitted during a transaction. This means there is no cache of sensitive user data waiting to be exploited by a hacker (ie target, home depot, etc). It can work like cash on the internet but without the downfalls of cash like counterfeiting.

One big advantage is that it can be used to add an additional factor in order to sign a transaction.
This prevents someone who not only gains access to your phone, but also knows your unlock password from stealing your bitcoin.
NFC tags can theoretically can boost the overall security of your wallet much more than a single password lock.
Some of the best security measures require multiple factor authentication.
Something you know (password)
Something you have (authentication token)
Something you are (biometrics such as fingerprint)

That's because "*bit*" omits any form of a prefix losing it's natural ability to convey quantity with its name.

The seller doesn't know, and there is nothing preventing you from doing a zero confirmation double spend against the merchant. Just as nothing *really* prevents you from pocketing an item and walking out of a store; or paying with a credit/debit card only to file a chargeback claim.
Theft and fraud are a big part of risk management that every business deals with. It's the ability to accept the inherent risk of a zero confirmation transaction in the same way they are willing to accept credit cards or allow customers to freely shop unguarded. Allowing for an overall more pleasant and streamlined experience for the customer while absorbing the small loss from those who steal/commit fraud regardless of the payment method involved.
At the same time, transactions once signed and pushed are propagated across the network almost instantly. This can allow the merchant a window to view the unconfirmed transaction and  see if it has a fee, its priority, inputs, etc. 
The unknown period for which a transaction may be turn out to be counterfeit or reversed is immensely smaller than other payment method as well. If a transaction is not double spent within the first confirmation, you can be almost certain it will never be.

"bit" is one of **the** worst unit denominations you could use. Bitcoin uses the SI metric prefixes known *around the world* as a global standard. If you have a problem understanding the basic principles of the math behind the metric system, you should rethink using bitcoin.
These unit prefixes are:
Micro - μBTC - microbitcoin - 0.000001 - Millionth
Milli - mBTC - millibitcoin - 0.001 - Thousandth
Centi - cBTC - centibitcoin - 0.01 - Hundredth 
Deci - dBTC - decibitcoin - 0.1 - Tenth
"bit" is short for Bitcoin and nothing else as bitcoin is the base whole unit. The prefix for the millionth unit is "micro", "microbitcoin", or "microbit" but never "bit" on it's own. This works for all units from millibits to decibits to centibits as well.
A bit is not a unit.

It's likely due to regional pricing. They use Coinbase ,which until recently only allowed payouts in USD. Many international companies face potential restrictions when it comes to displaying a local fiat and receiving another without immediate conversion. Unless they have a forex partner it can make things difficult.
It was simply easier for them to ignore the rest of the world and only allow USD prices to be available for Bitcoin.

It will greatly depend on the exchange availability.
Bitcoin is global and to have a sustained impact, the exchange needs to be accessible by users around the world.
Part of the failure with the Coinbase exchange launch and immediate price retraction was largely it's lack of an international presence. Coinbase is barely an national exchange, being open to only half the US was a real kick in the teeth to their marketing hype.

Bitcoin uses SI metric prefixes for unit denominations. One bitcoin is equal to one hundred million of the smallest sub-units known as Satoshi's. The sub-units include satoshi, microbitcoin, millibitcoin, centibitcoin, decibitcoin.
For a list of the units used in bitcoin, refer to the wiki 
If you want to display your balance in a sub-units such as microbitcoins you can do that. It's supported by most wallets, and doesn't require changing what one bitcoin is equal to.

BIP 101 is too extreme and doesn't actually solve the scaling issue. Using the same analogy earlier, it's still a can kick, but downhill that continues to tumble and exponentially increases. These increases happen automatically over time which is better but not great.
I'd be more in favor of a hard fork that allows the blocksize to be managed through consensus soft forks similar to BIP 100. The argument that a small percent could dictate and veto an increase or decrease is a double edged blade. Changing the size should be difficult and not taken lightly, requiring high consensus and discussions similar to the debates we have now.

Compromise is the last thing I want to see in Bitcoin. Compromising on issues leads to compromises elsewhere through foot in the door technique and lobbying. 
A hard fork to 2mb is nothing more than a kick the can, we'll fork again later. Doing so forces the scaling issue into a cycle of multiple hard forks. Scaling needs to be resolved in a single hard fork, not with frequent dangerous can kicking forks.
Standing strong and resisting irresponsible and hastily implemented change is part of what Bitcoin does. Hard forks should be avoided at all costs and only implemented when absolutely necessary, with a proven working solution.

Looking briefly at the address and other replies you made. The attack may have been manually done and information gathered over time. I say this due to timing between each transaction, and the fact you received then were able to move new coins. Receiving and moving new coins points to the address not being monitored by a bot. Instead login details being dumped then being checked at a later date.
I would definitely contact blockchain, and/or look up a list of IP's which last logged into your wallet.
Did you have a backup of the wallet stored anywhere? The paper containing your login, could it have been compromised? You mentioned this being the second time you lost coins, how did it happen the first time around? Any chance it was a repeat attack?

Running a full node on a VPS doesn't contribute to decentralization nearly the same way it does when compared to a local node.

I have messaged Humble Bundle support multiple times over the past year or two since they began accepting Bitcoin. This isn't the first time Humble Bundle removed bitcoin for bundles, and not the first time its disappeared from their store either.
They are placing the removal of Bitcoin and Amazon pay as a payment method for *bundles* solely on the publisher.
Here is an excerpt from an email response in regards to the Borderlands bundle and Bitcoin.


In regards to it being "*temporarily*" removed from their store; here is what they had to say.


Claiming fraud is not defamatory in any way, but points to weak implementation between them and their processor. For bitcoin they used/use the coinbase merchant api and accepted zero confirmation transactions. This allowed someone to game zero confirmation double spends to steal a bunch of keys. Coinbase does not seem to cover zero confirmation double spends leaving Humble Bundle taking a substantial enough loss for them to disable Bitcoin in the store. Had they set up their merchant service to require 1 confirmation before sending keys they would likely have not experienced issues of fraud.

Keeping track of how much mining power is on XT is rather difficult at this moment. Some pools have announced their support of various blocksize solutions but a pool *operator* does not represent the individual miners in that pool. As such miners may choose to leave or join a pool that aligns with their personal choice.
We will have to wait until majority of pools announce their position and give it time to see what individual miners choose to support. Trying to find support levels before that wont give a true representation.
Regardless of the outcome, if XT wins, there's no need to sell or buy into the new XT coin. XT is copying the bitcoin blockchain, if a fork does occur with high consensus the transition should be seamless and go mostly unnoticed for the end user. As we get closer to a potential fork more information about what needs to be done will be available. In general you likely won't have to do anything unless you use a client which maintains a full copy of the blockchain IE bitcoin core.

Additionally, don't keep all your coins in a single paper wallet. Generate multiple addresses and spread your cold storage across them. This makes it easier and potentially safer if you need to spend or move a small amount of out of cold storage.
A tip when generating multiple addresses, select "Hide Art" and set "Addresses per page:" 7. This will save paper when using many addresses. Generate the number of addresses as a multiple of 7. 14 gives you two pages of addresses, 21 gives you 3 pages, etc.

Looks pretty good. Except bitaddress.org only has one "t" either a spelling mistake or a phishing attempt ;)
Download bitaddress only from github never the live site, you can also take the extra steps to verify the bitaddress master zip.
The "fresh" OS should be a linux distro live cd. Don't use one that specifically advertises itself for bitcoin.
When loading the live cd, disconnect all harddrives, and storage mediums to prevent any writing.
Generate addresses with BIP 38 passphrase protected private key.
Print at least two copies to store in different locations in the event of disaster (ie fire) you can still recover your cold storage. To keep privacy when storing in a second location it's possible to remove the public address from the wallet. The public address easily gets derived from the private key once decrypted.

Yes, the coins would be mined separately, both generating their own version of the same block number. There is only a finite amount of mining power available and it will become weighted and split between the two chains causing one to have to outpace the other chain effectively destroying it.
Although at this time there's nothing to be really concerned about in terms in mining or hashrate drop. The XT client wont diverge from current bitcoin consensus until 2016 when/if 75% of blocks are generated by their client. By which point it could be assumed that if a version is looking to become dominant, miners will exponentially switch just prior to any fork. However it has been stated that Mike may implement a checkpoint to force the fork regardless of consensus.
In the event of a successful hardfork or consensus change, all wallets, clients, atms, and devices need to upgrade so they don't reject the new protocol rules. If they don't change to accept new rules they will be incompatible with everything post fork/shorter chain.
Uncertainty and risk is almost always the reason for price movements regardless of current events.

It's also worth noting that pool *operators* do not represent individual miners.
Many miners may choose to join, or leave pools supporting alternate blocksize changes. If a miners current pool doesn't, or no longer aligns with their personal blocksize preference we should expect to see the % hashrate of pools start to shift.

Linux can be run in a live "demo" entirely off a cd or usb running only in ram. The main advantage is that it's open, fast, and reliable without requiring an installation or any internal storage. Because the live environments run off of ram, powering down the system clears the ram and all traces the linux live session.
Here's a very rough outline of steps to create an offline "secure" environment to generate keys.
1. Download bitaddress master zip from github, extract to fat32 usb drive and verify the signature.  
2. Download a linux distro ISO, for example tails. Verify its signature as well. Tails also has an electrum wallet built in if you wanted to create an HD wallet seed. 
3. Burn the tails .iso to a CD/DVD or USB drive. (CD/DVD is more secure as it will be read-only)
4. Prepare the device you wish to load your live linux distro by removing all USB devices except mouse and keyboard, and disconnect ethernet cable. Power down the computer and open the case/laptop bottom and remove/disconnect all internal storage.
5. Power on and insert the linux live cd. If prompted to boot from cd press any key to do so. If you don't get the option to boot from cd/usb you may have to go into bios settings to change boot order priority.
6. Once live cd has been selected and is loaded as the OS, plug in the printer and USB drive containing the bitaddress. Verify the bitaddress html files once again then run it. The printer should not be a network printer and should be connected directly to the computer.
While this may seem complicated at first, it's a very straight forward process that takes very little time and effort but increases overall security immensely.

Many people seem to be misunderstanding this post as I didn't make it clear. My comment was based solely on blockchain storage growth in relation to proposed blocksize increases. 
The concern is less about bandwidth speeds (other than orphans,) and more so about the initial bootstrapping of new full nodes. How many would choose to run a full node locally if it meant having to download and sync over 1TB of data to start.
For anyone who is wondering, I do run full bitcoin nodes and know full well how much bandwidth they can potentially use. Over the past 20 days my local node has uploaded 260GB+ while blocking a handful of malicious nodes/peers that request identical data sets aimed at monitoring and sucking bandwidth/connection slots.

XT is a coup designed by Mike Hearn. Not only does XT break Bitcoin consensus, it removes the majority of developers and gives him full control over further development. This is a slight exaggeration but needs to be said.
It's being pushed mostly by people who want bigger blocks no matter the cost but may not understand that XT is not the only way to do so.
XT is essentially an altcoin. It's "bitcoin" only in name and is using the existing bitcoin blockchain as a bootstrap. Because XT is copying the Bitcoin blockchain, at the point of the "fork" all coins you have here will exist there as well.

Best solution in my opinion would be to pick up an old laptop (no more than 7 - 10 years old.) It will use slightly more electricity than a marketed/dedicated bitcoin node device, but can be cheaper and can offer a more robust solution.
If possible, find a used laptop with a broken display as they are usually much cheaper. You can set it up using the video out to a desktop monitor or tv. Once it's set up and running you rarely need to touch it.
For the HDD space and growing blockchain, I'd recommend using whatever is already in the laptop and only upgrading when it becomes necessary. HDD prices are only getting cheaper, the longer you wait the cheaper it will likely be.

Changing it would require a hard fork, completely rewritten coin distribution code, and overall wouldn't do much. If anything it would have a negative effect with more orphans and wasted work for miners.
Proof of work as used in bitcoin can be viewed as security in time. A 10 minute block is more or less worth 10 minutes of security. 
Changing to something like 2 minute blocks would require 5 blocks to get the same security built up as a single 10 minute block while offering no advantage. Services which wait 3 blocks to prevent attacks/double spends would need to wait 15 blocks for the same level of protection.

Using a wallet or application which requires or benefits from local access to the full blockchain does not equal running a full node.
Example being Armory is one of the best wallets out there and it requires bitcoind to be fully synced and running.
In it's current state with 288 block checks, this can cause massive delays in launching the wallet. These long delays directly impact usability by preventing instant access to wallet functions over a seemingly excessive verification process.
Having newbies set up and run a full node is not the goal, or needed; but discouraging them from having a local copy of the blockchain in favor of SPV clients is the wrong mindset.

In short, a broker sets the price and tells you what it's willing to pay/sell. An exchange allows you to set the buy/sell price, your order will sit in the order books until either filled or cancelled.
A broker, such as Coinbase inc offers it's clients a more "retail" experience of buying/selling. They set the price, take a commission, and don't allow access to other traders or order books. Everything is done behind the scenes at an upfront cost.
A Bitcoin exchange gives you full access the buy and sell order book as a trader. Allowing you to become a market maker with direct access and little to no limits. All orders are settled with other traders in real time without going through an intermediary agent. You place an order and wait for it to be filled by another trader based on market movements.
A brief difference between a broker and market maker can be found here. While it may not translate perfectly to Bitcoin, it will give you the basic idea.

Why is it that Bitcoin Core, by default still requires a **288** block check at a verification level of 3 when launched? 
This is the main reason even on decent hardware the core client can take a fairly long time before it becomes usable. This can be almost cripplingly long on outdated hardware such as older laptops. 
While it's easily changed using -checkblocks=&lt;n&gt; it still bewilders me as to why we need to check an estimated 48 hours of network history prior to the client being usable. Verification and block checks should be "good enough" with only checking the last 72 blocks. That alone would give a nearly 4x quicker launch time without any real impact on security.
I've seen a few people turn away from bitcoin core due to both its initial sync and long launch times. Headers first has significantly helped with syncing, shouldn't we strive to also improve launch times? It should be as easy and non-intimidating as possible for those interested in running a client with a copy of the full blockchain.

That's an unfortunately large amount of money on a VPS solely for a bitcoin node. If you used a "service" aimed towards running a bitcoin node, someone profited well off the recent drama.
A full node can be set up and run for only $20 a **year** on a VPS if you are patient and search for sales. A $20 monthly VPS is overkill and/or overpriced although seemingly may be more resilient to a DDOS attack ;)
I hope you reconsider running a node again in the future, perhaps not 10 but one, maybe two. It doesn't matter what client or version you choose to run. Increasing the amount of active full nodes that follow protocol consensus is a good thing. Local full nodes are seen as a better option as they increase decentralization while VPS full nodes won't offer the same decentralization but tend to have faster more robust bandwidth and can have better uptime and reliability.

Unfortunately at this time, very few wallets support stealth address formats.

The market has been offline/unavailable for over 24 hours. The consolidation of the markets suspected operating funds has lead to speculation of another exit-scam in progress.

Just like Coinbase inc's lunar pre-launch hype rally and how it would take bitcoin to the "moon." Except it was nowhere to be seen that it would only be available in ~~America~~ *a few select states.* At least this announcements makes it known where it's available right away.

Looking at some of their trade history you can see how low trade volume could easily play a part. Limited trading means limited profit which leads to fewer employees able to be staffed. They could have been understaffed, running at a loss, or barely keeping their head above water. Add in a database compromise and not enough man power to resolve the issue/reputation damage and you're looking at a business which doesn't have a bright future or long term viability.
Perhaps they will relaunch under a new name and new infrastructure starting fresh with better policies and security.

It is terrible; when that "rule" was put in place the tipbot at the time at least ran on the blockchain. Giving users much more control until changetip replaced it, and all inherent security was thrown out the window with custodial wallets no transparency and limited user control.
I feel changetip goes against many fundamentals of bitcoin. It also lacks any major competition to keep them honest. 
That rule needs to be removed and an emphasis placed on users maintaining control of their private keys along with choosing on-chain services rather than centralized off-chain ones.

Putting aside the "spirit" of Bitcoin; Ask yourself, what does the blockchain offer?
Among many things, the blockchain offers security, transparency, accountability, and verifiable reserves beyond what any non-blockchain based technology can offer today.
This really isn't about the various pros and cons of a centralized/decentralized ledger/accounting system. It's how eager companies are to remove all benefits of the blockchain and resort back to security through obscurity because it's easier, more convenient, or familiar.
When the rules say *changetip* is the only way we are allowed to send bitcoins among each other and the first thing they do is remove the technology that secures Bitcoin in favor of their own internal accounting. The next thing you should do is question their security and motives, then try to find alternatives.
You are not tipping bitcoin with changetip. You are tipping internal IOU's which may or may not be valid upon withdrawal. The company doesn't earn profit from it's users, but it likely makes it *off* their users through big data. What better place for marketing companies to track spending across multiple accounts on various social media platforms that are nicely linked together. More often than not, if the service is free, your information is the product.

If I recall, someone placed a market sell order of around 15000 bitcoins (likely accidentally) causing a "flash crash" as it ate up a majority of the buys in the order book. The result was someone selling a lot of bitcoins at far below the global market value.

If you can view the prices in USD you can check out in Bitcoin.

Ask him to send you a picture of the public and private key for the address.. So you can verify the value. A picture of the front/back of an AMEX gift card often has all the information needed to pull value from it.
It could very well be a scam, and you're right to be cautious. At the end of the day you need to assess the risk vs reward for dealing with this particular trader. If you find the risks outweigh the reward then find someone else to trade with.

You realize this was only voice/text chat, not video, or in person. No worse than the numerous phone sex lines advertised nightly on tv. There's also no issue with the age of the "girls" as they were within the legal age based on his region and location of the service. Legal complications could only arise if it was purposely geared towards individuals living within the US or other regions where the legal age is 18+. At which point they would only have to block access to those regions.

Why pass savings onto customers when you can pocket the savings yourself?
Part of the incentive for merchants is that *they* save on fees. Passing the savings on is optional, and only needed if the merchant wants to see customers using Bitcoin over other payment methods.

You were tipped in **microbitcoin**, some users try and refer to them "bits" which tends to cause more confusion as "bit" is understandably short for *bit*coin.

Be very careful when purchasing game keys from questionable sources. Always question and search for where and how they obtain their keys. Make sure they have a partnership with an official supplier to avoid grey market key sellers. 
Here are two reputable sites which accept Bitcoin. Prices/location may need to be set to US/NA to enable Bitcoin checkout.

I wouldn't consider paying with zero chance of identity theft, or hidden and additional charges pulled from my account at a later date*"nothing."* 
The benefits of bitcoin aren't solely in it's lower fees for commerce. Other benefits include the features that protect consumers from fraud, identity theft, sanctions, frozen accounts, etc. I don't need a discount to use bitcoin in my day to day life.
Competition currently has little to do with it right now. Until adoption of Bitcoin among merchants is more prevalent, they are unlikely to have direct competition within the Bitcoin economy. I will still go out of my way to use bitcoin with or without a discount and merchants know this; they don't need to incentive me further.

A five dollar wrench can break a person; but that only goes as far as to find out what that individual knows. Good luck using it against multi-sig situations where the other key holders may be anonymous, autonomous, or inaccessible. Bitcoin is programmable money and there are ways to lock down and  secure your bitcoins beyond a five dollar wrench attack.
The DPR coins weren't exactly stored securely to begin with. Everything was available in a single wallet protected by a single password.

Confirmations = how many additional blocks have been added to the blockchain since your transaction. They will go up indefinitely at roughly 1 every 10 minutes and each one adds security. (Waiting more than a couple confirmations is almost unheard of and impractical for retailers)
The bitcoins were successfully sent with 59 confirmations, that's nearly indisputable. Are you sure the address you sent the coins to, was the correct one provided by the retailer/merchant? Verify the address they were sent to with the merchant.
Is this a reputable place, is their a chance it's a front for a scam?

Very impressed with the silkroad/tor section despite the ominous and dark tone of the music.
This is might be the first time I have ever seen it mentioned in mainstream media that not everything on the Silk Road was illegal. Silk Road was an open marketplace to anyone and everyone to sell nearly anything. To top it off, they made a *legal* purchase from the silkroad too.

I think they blocked withdrawals to users from outside Canada awhile back, I remember a post on reddit this past summer. Are you connecting with a VPN or an IP outside of Canada, do they require verification if so are you verified?

Until it gets released or added to a repository you can manually "upgrade." While there might be a "correct" way, this should work.
close down the current version of bitcoin core qt and make a **backup of your wallet.dat.**
Extract the contents of the tar.gz to bitcoin directory ~/.bitcoin overwriting existing files (this should not effect your current wallet.dat or already synced blockchain.)
Launch bitcoin core qt like you normally would and it will be running the RC 0.10.0
