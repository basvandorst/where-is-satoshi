The value of it is dictated by the value that people assign to it. That can be influenced by herd mentality, adoption, manipulation, use cases, and costs associated with operating the network among other factors.

I'm learning to buy whenever all the comments in this thread are negative. That $5k day earlier this year was right on.

Fun test! I don't agree with some of their answers though, but some I just didn't know. The fungibility question for lightning is up for debate...it's not anonymous so it's not quite fungible and coins could technically be tainted by bad actors.

The quality of money you're talking about is Unit of Account. Since bitcoin is very volatile at this stage, it isn't great for price labels. This quality should improve over time with use and adoption.
By the way, using bitcoin doesn't help consensus, but running a full node would!

It maintains its value over time (Store of Value), it is highly liquid and can be used as a medium of exchange with anyone on the globe willing to accept it, it is resistant to censorship and being seized, it is borderless, it has no downtime compared to other payment processors like Visa, it is permissionless so that anyone (or anything) can participate in the new financial system.

Having worked in a call center that handled class action lawsuits, the cases that I saw demonstrated a pattern of banks taking advantage of the poor and the uneducated at such a scale that would have been unthinkable to me before I started. I was appalled at the lack of ethics each of the banks demonstrated through discriminatory lending, reordering transactions to maximize overdraft fees, or opening accounts in customers' names without permission. I saw the meager payouts from lawsuits filed against the big banks. I watched the 2008 financial crisis destroy my dreams of being an engineer and instead apply to temp jobs that put me in a call center in the first place.
What motivates me? I want to see the big banks crumble. I want to see the industry of predation on the poor and uneducated be utterly destroyed. 
Bitcoin offers an alternative. Bitcoin offers a method of gathering consensus that accelerates the essence of democracy to the pace of technology. Bitcoin offers transparency into the workings of the financial system. Bitcoin is not out to maximize fees; it's out to provide the best service that's more reliable, more transparent, more resilient, and more open to the globe. Bitcoin is the bank killer.

One p2p decentralized exchange is Bisq, which might fit your needs if you have other cryptos.
If you don't have other cryptos, is look into "local bitcoins" or finding a bitcoin atm.

Looks like you got a confirmation! Maybe try a replaceable transaction next time for "child pays for parent" when you enter too low of a fee for the network.

Andreas Antonopolous and his book the internet of money. Absolutely mind blowing book.

Ah if only it was at $14k again.
Also, Coinbase is a bank. Your keys, your coins. Not your keys, not your bitcoin.

My coinbase app says that buying BTC is not available in my country...and I'm in the US. What gives?

I like Electrum and Mycellium

Ammous is kind of a dick imho. He does some great analysis of historical currencies and their downfalls in his book, but podcasts that he's been (Noded, notably) on display a level of ego that betray his points.
Bitcoin set up a framework that can be reproduced or tailored for more specific use cases. Other crypto currencies have advantages that bitcoin could implement and agility to test out new approaches. It behooves us to learn from others in this space and avoid the pitfalls that others experience. 
Tribalism may be beneficial for creating a cohesive community, but may not serve us well when the cyptocurrency space is threatened by regulation.

Can someone please explain to me why an ATM is needed for bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:01:18
So does it exchange currency?
