This is irrelevant. If miners don't do what they are supposed to do then there is something wrong with the protocol. If the protocol makes it more lucrative to be counter productive then so be it. This tech is new and no one should expect it to work without a reboot or bug fixes.
[edit] For the people not liking and downvoting this: Would you rather have a currency where everyone is forced to play by the rules BY PROTOCOL or because you rely on their benevolence? This post asks miners to act benevolent it's like whining. It has to work better than that.

Oh my god do you sometimes cum when you think of your imaginary IQ? [Dunning Krueger Effect](


Oh wow that's some perspective right there. Maybe I will gain respect for not paying my student loan and laying out my own terms. Did you even think for a second that the Greek politicians have thought about this one matter more than you will think about everything in your entire lifetime and they did not come to your genial conclusion that not paying will show the rest of the world how big their balls are but will lead to a variety of other problems that you can't even imagine in your shortsightedness.
Why do you even bother to talk about economics when you have no idea how anything related to economy works? You know just reading up some crypto conspiracy on a internet forum doesn't make you an economics genius (but I guess you think you are a beacon of intelligence in this dull world and could solve everything if humanity would let you).
And just a quick hint: The next time you ask something (even if it's not stupid) it is always counterproductive to hint your intellectual superiority at your audience and if you in fact were intelligent (social intelligence is also a part of intelligence you know?) you would have already known that. But I don't think you can grasp such a simple contradiction because in your mind everything other people say is of lesser importance right?
But lets assume all this bullshit you are trying to sell off as a new economic system (just changing the currency and not paying your debts until your debt is worthless) that certainly no one before you ever had makes sense and does work. How to you thing Greece will purchase BTC in the magnitude that they would need for their economy to actually work? WITHOUT HAVING MONEY?

that is a bad idea. A desktop computer can compute millions of hashes per second with it's GPU so chances are that your lottery will get scammed by it's users (they computer the numbers that produce your hash).
Rather than doing that you should disclose the algorithm used to produce the random numbers and then use a random seed produced from user entropy (at least 256 bits).
Then you can hash that seed and deliver it before the user starts picking numbers on a web page (or reddit post).
After all tips have been collected you deliver the winning numbers and the actual seed.
That way 
1. an attacker would have to guess a 256 bit seed (which is harder than guessing the actual numbers).
2. Users can verify that you didn't cheat by verifying that a) hash(seed)=disclosed hash, b) rng_algorithm(seed)=winning numbers. In order to cheat you would have to find a 256 bit number that produces the same hash (which is as hard as brute forcing 256 bit keys). Since you disclosed the seed before collecting tips there is no way of altering the winning numbers to a preferable outcome for you.
If you wish i can write you some code for this stuff.

How about:
User buys 1000BTC through tor (or even with cash).
In case that's not enough: User mixes his BTC through a mixing service (again using tor).
User goes on drug market site (Using tor).
My point is that law enforcement (or other entities) can't trace you purely through BTC they somehow have to associate your BTC adressses with your identity. This can be avoided pretty good with tor and other services.

If your transaction was confirmed and accepted by the network that means that the money has arrived on the target address.
A transaction describes is exactly that: an amount of bitcoins is transferred from address A to B. If a transaction is confirmed, this transfer is effective. There is no distinction between transaction and actual arrival of bitcoins.

Listen to yourself... why are you getting so emotional over this? Humans will never act 100% moral especially on the internet and when it's about money. Should bitcoin fail then it is much preferable that it fails early. Your pitiful screaming for moral behavior is like a rabbit screaming at a bunch of wolfs that they should not eat him because murder is wrong. Of course humans should behave moral but if they would you would not need a currency because everyone would only take what he needs and share his stuff and help others and and and... but humans DON'T.

First off: thanks for your long and open response, I appreciate it.


I think you have taken my comment out of [context]( To say that fiat money holds no value is as wrong as saying bitcoin holds no value. These are both wrong statements and it is another example of a delusional zealot. In my opinion bitcoin has great potential in becoming a widely accepted currency but that day has yet to come. Nevertheless some users here treat bitcoin as if it has already erased all fiat currencies out there (e.g. with statements like that).


This is not true. I think I understand more than the average troll but not enough to be an expert. And I more often than not try to give other visitors of this sub productive information especially regarding the technical aspects of bitcoin. And after all if I was that ignorant I would simply stop using this sub because I would think I know everything there is to know about bitcoin.
As to the other parts of the critique on this thread: you are right I should have provided more examples and probably title the thread more carefully. I will consider this the next time I create a thread or post a comment. Thank you for your input.

The service is taking your money and gambling with it and yes charging someone who want's access to something that is considered his in the first place should be a crime.
The only benefit that I see in Banks vs Bitcoins is that they rent you out a place to keep your money safe. There should be a small rent for this particular service and nothing more.

Usually you (or the wallet Software) decide how much and if you want to pay a fee at the time you create a transaction. You should contact the gaming site with this, maybe they have not processed the payment yet.


NOBODY IS ABLE TO TAKE ANY AMMOUNT OF BITCOINS FROM YOU not even miners, if they don't own the private keys for your addresses. But like I said before, transaction fees are of no concern to you once your transactions have been confirmed by the network. They only come into play before your transaction gets confirmations.

Why use email, when you can use a fax machine?
Why use a car, when horses are perfectly fine?
Why use the phone when you can communicate via mail?
Why use a light bulb when you can light a candle?
But to answer your question: In the system we have now everyone who wants to do business is forced to join the banking system. This excludes many people that have no access to a bank (e.g. in the third world). I don't say that there is no better alternative than bitcoin ever but right now bitcoin seems like a pretty good alternative to the current banking system.
And there are no differences when exchanging bitcoins via a BTC bank and your private wallet, ergo there are no frictions when you transfer BTC from one "bank" to another or to a wallet. BTC "banks" simply hold our BTC in a (hopefully) safe place. And you can see if the bank tries something funny with your BTC via the public key whilst in the current banking system the banks can use the money whatever they want for and you have to take their word on that your money is still there.
Like I said maybe there is something better but we haven't found it yet and the current banking system has failed. So instead of bashing the other alternative, why don't you come up with a better alternative?

I don't understand. Correct me if I'm wrong but it should be possible to double spend the coins by putting them into the multisig wallet AND another address simultaneously.
At least the third party (Green address) will have to wait for confirmations on the multisig addess and from there, double spending is impossible.
@_date: 2015-07-23 10:09:56
? Thanks for summarizing my comment i guess. You redefined inflation from the point of view of bitcoin which is wrong.


If this was true then a debt free company would have no incentive to be efficient. That's not how it works. Companies are profit oriented the more profit the better.
Economic growth works because a company that produces more efficiently than everybody else can either sell for the lowest price or make the most profits or both, forcing the others to reduce their prices until they can't compete anymore. This has nothing to do with debt.
You are right in one point tho: Debt allows people to be productive with new ideas, technologies etc. without being forced to do something less productive until they have collected enough money on their own. This is why debt can in the right doses can drive economic growth.

It's really hard to tell you anything because it is not clear what the problem is. I will just explain to you how bitcoin works in a very low techy way:
Each time your wallet recieves bitcoins it in fact just "imports" an address("publik key hash") that is assigned these bitcoins for which you control a particular private key. When you spend bitcoins from your wallet to an address B, your wallet checks several of your addresses (A1,A2) for the ammount of bitcoins and creates a transaction (A1,A2) -&gt; B. When this transaction is broadcast and confirmed by the network, your bitcoins are irreversibly spent and the owner of B can do whatever he wants with them.
@_date: 2015-07-14 17:05:37
Mining will always be just barely profitable and only with highly specialized equipment. It's in its nature because as BTC rises in value so do the people who want to mine it. When the price goes down, so does the # of miners and the difficulty of mining.
What will happen in the end is subject to speculation at most, just like bitcoin itself. BTW there are much more pressing concerns (2 TX/second is unbearable for example).

Reading this throws another question: How can you discern a change address from a "real" address of another user?

The computer industry is no example for a deflationary market. You don't buy the same product each year for less money, you buy a higher quality product after your old computer gets "unusable".
Companies who would stop improving their products would go out of business very fast because the competitor who doesn't stop takes over their customers. This applies to any industry. This deflation has nothing to do with currency, it is caused by increased efficiency in the industry (it is a "good" deflation representing that there is less effort in producing the product each year). 
But if people just keep on holding to their money (wallets) instead of investing it (through banks) the money doesn't enter the marked and since the circulating money supply shrinks, prices go down (not because products were produced more efficiently but because there is less money).

I think you don't realize that money lending is not inherently bad. For example i would not be able to study if i could not lend money and this situation will never change. 
Just because bitcoin is deflatory doesn't mean people won't need to lend money to do stuff. There still will be people with more money and power than others but it is much harder for those people to fuck everyone over. 
Bitcoins can't just be created from nothing. If someone lends you a bitcoin that bitcoin exists, unlike a bank that just writes numbers on your bank account regardless if they actually own that kind of money.
But lending and interest payoff will not cease to exist and if you think so you are delusional.

How the seed can restore all your addresses:
Computers are unable to create random numbers but there are algorithms that produce pseudorandom numbers (e.g. numbers that are nearly as hard to guess). It works by entering some real random data (the seed) and then using that to deterministically compute new numbers in a way that the new numbers cannot be deterministically computed without the seed.
Given the same seed and pseudo random generating algorithm, the sequence of all generated numbers (private keys) will always be the same no matter what device you use to produce them. That is why you can restore your wallet with only that seed.
These words you wrote down from the trezor is in fact a really big number encoded by English language that represents your personal random seed. (Each word is a number between 0 and 2048)

This is all right and good but very different for business investors. They almost exclusively value more money more than money. And that is the reason a company would always have to outperform the deflation rate to be successful. Which in turn greatly greatly increases the risk of investors and thus stops or slows economy growth. At least that's how I understand it.
Another thing bitcoiners ignore is: banks as evil as you may think they are, actually invest into the industry with your deposits, driving the economy forward. When everyone is his own bank, no one does this job which again slows the economy down.

1. Yeah there are some sites that can lend you bitcoins.
2. Federally insured? No. But the government can also not take your money whenever it feels like it (I'm looking at you Greece).
3. If it's only for the delight of putting paper in some strippers G-string then you can ofc print paper wallets with the equal ammount of btc in them. Else I hope this won't be necessary in the future.

These 12 words represent a random seed that is used to compute all keys that were and ever will be produced by that wallet. 
When you type those words into another device, the device looks in the public ledger, available to all computers on the internet (Block Chain), what addresses you already have used for your wallet and recomputes the corresponding addresses keys (with the help of the seed).
You can't spend bitcoins twice because for spending a bitcoin you have to broadcast a transaction to the so called miners that earn a small transaction fee by checking your signature and balance and if everything is all right they put the transaction into the public ledger and the corresponding bitcoins have officially changed their owner.
If you attempt to send bitcoins from an address without proper balance, it can't be verified by miners and will be rejected. If you try to spend the same bitcoins twice simultaneously you would have to broadcast two transactions from the same address. The miners will accept one of these transactions and reject the other.

I think what you are searching for is more a decentralized video platform. There is no hope for a serious news platform without some kind of censorship (reviews) over each story to check it for facts and consistency.
Also why do you start with videos and not with texts? A video is a little harder to produce and edit and publish (resource wise) than text. In theory you could build some kind of blog and hire editors to fact check and edit things but it's still centralized.
The problem with news is that they can't be objectively verified to 100% and are always at least a little bit biased by the author and editors.
One idea is to build a decentralized reddit and hope that some subs like will evolve where content is not utterly shit for the lack of editing.

That is the wrong wording. No one ever hacked a wallet key (this would mean that either the ECDSA was implemented wrong or the algorithm is flawed).

There are transactions in the mempool that haven't been confirmed for hours.

A signature is encrypted with the signers private key and decrypted with the signers public key. Basically the key roles are reversed when signing. That way a verifier can be sure that the message was sent by someone who in fact owns the corresponding private key.
In your example i don't need the private key d but the public key that is publicly available else i cannot verify your signature.
If I spend BTC what I basically do is write a message that i want to transfer X BTC from A to B, A being my public key and sign this message with the private key of A so that the miners (or you) can verify it by checking A against this signature.
That way i cannot send BTC from A to B without owning the private key of A (the signature would be invalid and the transaction rejected by miners).
Digital signing is impossible without encryption.

So we pay a giant system of bad people bossing us around with massive use of force and call it government in fear of bad people bossing us around?
The idea of anarchy is that no one has power over any human being and the non aggression principle.
Here are 3 possible philosophical standpoints about humans:
Either every human is inherently good, then there is no need for a government because no one does immoral or bad things to someone else.
Or every human is inherently bad, then there is no need for a government because its representatives who are also humans are also bad but now wield much more power over everyone else.
If some humans are good and bad then there is no one in the world who can discriminate the two without a very close inspection which is impossible on a nation wide vote scale. Ergo somewhen a bad guy will take over and bring suffering to everyone else. It happened over and over and over and over again: Weimar Republic -&gt; Erstes Reich(Hitler), Red china -&gt; Mao Zedong, Soviet Union -&gt; Stalin...
And even the democratic governments of the modern civilization bring suffering death and destruction in the form of war or economical poverty to this world. This will continue until we stop asking ourselves who is best suited for the throne of government and take away that throne for good.

And the blockchain was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the transaction. And the Spirit of satoshi moved upon the face of the transactions.

And satoshi saw the bitcoin, that it was good and satoshi divided the bitcoin by 100,000,000.

You are talking nonsense i can easily compute every single adress in use today (sha256) by simply analyzing the blockchain. Why we don't simply use public keys as addresses is subject to speculations. The reason to not use addresses twice is that it opens up a possible attack when reuse is not properly implemented (static "k" number in two different signatures like seen in the ps3). That there are possible attacks when it is properly implemented is very unlikely because it would render ecdsa useless in general. The other reason is that excessive address reuse makes it easier to identify the owners of the addresses involved in the transactions.

Don't panic. Backup your Wallet, remove it from your wallet software, restart the software and reimport the wallet. If your transaction still has no confirmations, the wallet should show the coins.

Your theory only works, if the economy growth is also predictable.

You are confused. Inflation is a general increase of prices often caused by an increased money supply in the economy.
If people "overbuy" bitcoin and store it in their wallets, this money does not enter the market, effectively shrinking the circulating money supply and causing a further decrease of prices, causing consumers to hold even more (only buying if its really necessary because the longer they wait the more they can buy with the same amount). The deflationary spiral is born.
Now this is all just theory, I cannot remember a historic example of a deflationary spiral.

1,048,346/270&lt;=3883 ( able to be included in block assuming all tx are minimal)
A block is mined every 10 minutes=600 seconds.
3883/600 &lt;= 7 transactions per second.
TL;DR: With a block size limit of 1MB bitcoin can process 7 transactions per second AT MOST. (The actual number is probably somewhere near 2-3).

That's not the problem. The problem is say we have a deflation rate of 10% then a company that produces 5% profit in a neutral currency ($100 in, $105 out) is not viable anymore (100BTC in, 100*(1+(0.05-0.1))=95BTC out. And they have no way of getting a credit for new machines etc. This means each industry would have to outperform the deflation rate.

This means that I'm free as long as my opinion is mainstream. When i differ i have to do what most think is best for me just because that's the way it is right now. What right did the US government (or any government in the history of humanity) to claim territorial ownership over anything? That's like coming somewhere and saying that this terrirtorium is now officially theirs and 
because there exists a majority of collective thinking individuals who butcher some red skinned people in the name of that "law" makes it happen. Wonderful!


Yes it is unless it is necessary to protect other individuals. That people disobey you (by not paying taxes, not following your "laws" or not doing what you think is best for them) is not an excuse to lock them up. If you can't convince people for your cause without using force then you are wrong. And that is exactly what the government does: it forces us do do what it wants us to with the thread of violence.


Why? Why? Why? Why did gay people have to accept that they can't marry just because some douche-bags decided that they have to? Why do i have to acquire permission from this "government" to build a business and be productive? Why am I forced to pay a government that i didn't choose, elect nor like when I am perfectly able to govern myself? It's tyranny. And people are brainwashed to believe that this tyranny is a good thing. No one I have talked to had arguments that could convince me otherwise and it makes me insanely sad.

This is irrelevant and wrong. Deflation is not the growth of absolute money supply but:"In economics, deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services." A deflation can even occur with fiat currencies.
If a economy grows faster than the money supply then we usually speak of deflation.
Don't redefine a term so that it suits you or go to tumblr.
The driver of economic growth is increase in efficiency when producing wares and goods. The money supply is somewhat like water for a plant:If you can't supply enough water, the plant dies and if you supply to much it also dies. Ideally you want the money supply to match the value of wares and goods in the economy at any given time.
Debt is if you so want how you supply money to the economy.

That's not how it works. Since you send all bitcoins to one address (A) he can simply create a transaction (A)-&gt;B (since all the bitcoins from the tiny transactions are already in A).
To do what you want you would have to know the root pubkey of a HD wallet and even then you could simply ignore those tiny addresses (the wallet software would do it automatically).

When it takes 10 minutes(600 seconds) with 360 *10^15 H/s it would take your computer 360 *10^6 *600=2.16 × 10^11 seconds=6849 years so your chances with this super equipment to find a block this year would be 1/6849

there are so many ways to keep your millions safe without needing a bank.
Consider a 2 of 3 lockbox:
One is a paperwallet/trezor (Cold storage) in a bank lockbox or somewhere safe and not at your home
One is a HotWallet for day to day transactions, backed up in the cloud (encrypted)
And one is a cold wallet at your house.
You put your life savings there and are pretty secure even when your hot wallet gets hacked, your bank/trusted other party tries to screw you over or your house burns down. At least 2 of these wallet would have to get compromised/lost for you to loose your life savings. And if that's not enough you can always create a k of n lock-box with higher security measures.
This all can and probably will be implemented in a user friendly way.

That IS the problem. No bitcoin in the world can protect us if we accept a scam in the magnitude of the banking system just because "else our current system would collapse". So what? Let the fucking system collapse and burn and whatnot, its fucking time finally. This broken piece of shit system enslaves people for 300 years now an people are to blind to see it. When people want to be ignorant an change nothing and eat the shit that their slave masters feed them then let them. The problem will get solved eventually when this giant banking money circle jerk falls down or people realize that they are the slaves. When people just use bitcoin to move currency (btw there is a difference between money and currency) from A to B then there will be no mass adoption except in that one field.
@_date: 2015-07-10 17:21:04

This post is some serious circle jerk with no actual information. Who cares what bitcoin is backed by? I don't give a damn. In my opinion not even gold has an intrinsic value and people only value it high because there is some demand for it AS A CURRENCY.

The right to vote your oppressors doesn't make the oppressors more rightful. I can't vote to exclude my home from government ergo i'm being pressured into the state against my free will. The government has no more moral right to put people in prison that you and i do: none. It is fundamentally wrong to lock people up. When was the last time you had a direct choice in political affairs when you could concretely vote for or against a certain law? Laws are nothing more than pieces of paper written by thugs who want to take the freedom away from their human brothers for the thugs own benefit.
Just because we live in a democracy doesn't make us free. We are living under the threat of violence if we disobey our masters.

You have the order confused: You first create a cold storage and then buy bitcoins. There are quite some solutions for this. If you want to invest heavy then i suggest you get yourself a [Trezor^TM ]( for $119 because it is exactly what you want: a secure cold storage device with a backup solution that can be written down on paper in case the trezor breaks.
Another solution is to get a paperwallet from a website but I would not recommend that because you have to either print/store a key after each transaction or will use the same address over and over again which is a security and privacy risk.
There is another solution: an offline wallet on a computer or device that never touches the internet. But this needs some technical knowledge.

The way i thought of would be to create a 2 of 3 lockbox consisting of

2. HotWallet on your day to day computer (to be used for daily transactions. This wallet is also regularly backed up with the encrypted root key in the cloud (dropbox or something)
3. ColdWallet on a computer that never touches the internet and has a paper backup at your house (its merely purpose is to sign transactions for the lockbox) [edit] Could even be a trezor.
Then you can store your life savings (or large ammounts of bitcoins) and will be able to access it even when somone hacks your hot wallet, your home burns down or the bank tries some shit on you (no single point of failure).

People don't buy computers for their value (or price) but for their utility (computational power). This does not apply to investments. That's what you don't understand.

The government won't like it if it can't control the inflation :D.

The comments under that video made me cringe. People not realizing that fiat currencies have the same intrinsic value that bitcoin has: none.

I think if i ever sell or buy a house with bitcoins i will take my time and wait for confirmations.

I am not sure if I wanted to be friends with someone who did not criticize my thoughts and opinions. No one profits when your whole circle of friends is just a circle jerk.

Have you ever seen airbitz? It's exactly the same as signing up some online account.

Why can't i send them cash in an envelope with the BTC address on it (as QR or plaintext).
@_date: 2015-07-12 13:23:45
That's plain wrong. Math is a tool created by humans to describe various phenomena. Math is the human language for example for physics.

You mean like a state controlled by you and your money? With it's own currency backed by bitcoins? Later dropping the backed standard and simply printing money? Then creating institutions that simply give out credit with that new currency without actually holding cash?:D

Remember the leaked celebrity nudes a while ago? These were only leaked because security questions are a horrible idea for users with highly available public data. I strongly recommend not using those if you are not sure what persons have access to the information asked in the question.

Of course! Economic growth represents efficiency. And humans should not stop implementing scientific advances in new technologies to make life more effortless for everyone.

Actually many wallets can be configured to not relay those transactions. I don't know if it's enough to block all zero fee spam transactions but it could slow them down for sure.
Also for this kind of attack it is enough to include a very small fee &gt;0.

Heeey this guy used a crypto currency in his ccomment let's all give him upvotes :D:D:D

What i don't get is that he thinks there will be a service to hold the private keys. I think it is far more likely that hardware like trezor will evolve and people will spend the 1-2 days necessary to inform themselves about pub/private keys in order to keep their wallets save.
After all why would i want a bank/service to hold my keys after all the shit happening in Greece.

The guys that hacked "the hacking team" sound surprisingly like anonymous.

It's a little bit like asking if there is a cat friendly mouse.

Why do so many people in this sub always get butt hurt about the fact that there is no inherent value in bitcoin? So what. Fiat money is backed by debt (e.g. imaginary numbers what one owes the other) IT DOESN'T MATTER! Value is what you are willing to give for something else. It doesn't have to be backed by anything.
To end this argument of the inherent value coming from electricity by mining: If this was the case i could make my own crypto currency and people would be willing to buy it BECAUSE IT HAS THIS INHERENT VALUE. But it doesn't work that way. Energy you spend on something is transformed (often irreversible for humans) so it can't be used as a store of value.

That is no valid answer. To my understanding the ATM prints out a private key that can be scanned by the device described in that article. The thief only needs to setup something to automatically transfer the scanned bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-07-06 12:34:32
Well Okay that way someone can see that i owned these addresses somewhere in the past before they were emptied. What else can you deduce from that information? Probably the balance and ownership of the change address since it is unlikely that someone creates two payments in one transaction and has the fitting amount of BTC. But still not all funds in a single wallet.

I don't unterstand how a law can possibly protect anyone from terrorists that won't obey that particular law (e.g. still use encryption). I don't think he is under the delusion that this will work, so I assume that the british government seeks a backdoor to spy on their own citizens which is disgusting.
@_date: 2015-07-14 11:46:08
Not entirely correct, you can trust it with about (100-100/2^(256))% But yeah that's enough for me :D.

I'm not a fan of pay to win games. And your game sounds like you have to invest more funds into it then competing players so that in the end you win the most funds back and others get less/nothing. That is incredibly unfair especially for a game where it's supposed to be about fun.
I think most people are being sucked dry from powerful companies that control money enough in real life.

Bitcoin is of no help for Greece because the general public of Greece has no money to buy it. Still an awesome picture.
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:57:40
I know and it is.

Because hoarding currency always helps a market to evolve and bring you new goods and services... Idiots

You should read up about economics dude.
