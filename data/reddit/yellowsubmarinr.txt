You also implied you know the *perfect* time to buy back in. We all know this is all glorified gambling. Humble yourself, being smug isn’t a good look
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:22:03
Those are some sour grapes you have 
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:49:25
GOOD luck 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:24:20
No, it’s the truth.

To be fair, Kanye is way better than the other stuff you listed. Dude has multiple classic albums
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:28:11
BCH just tripled in price instantly. This shit is disgusting, how obvious the manipulation is 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:08:44
This sort of reads like a copypasta
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:54:01
These guys claim they cracked bitcoin, we call FUD and you think it's ridiculous? I'm genuinely confused. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:12:53
Yeah, it depends on the wallet, but anyone can send to your public key. For sending it depends on the wallet but should be fairly straightforward 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:04:40
There doesn't need to be 261B in the system, this whole what if scenario is moot because there is no chance that everyone all sells at once. Is there a crash coming? Probably. And you know what will happen? The people who believe in it will see the fire sale on bitcoin and buy buy buy. And when it recovers the weak hands will regret selling and everyone else will be *just fine*
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:00:12
Price is irrelevant for what you are talking about because you can break one full coin into literally one million pieces. Even if a bitcoin is worth 1 million dollars, then every satoshi is worth one dollar. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:30:46
Coinbase is fine 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:24:30
What does that even mean. Like all altcoins combined? I don't get it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:10:08
Hahahah this is great. Also 14,000 was only two days ago!
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:56:56
Yep, and just a few minutes after your post it hit 14k. This is so absurd!!
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:53:51
I'm calling bullshit. Your account name is in reference to this disaster you are telling us about, but yet this all happened last night? Not buying it 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:20:38
ITT: OP mad at bitcoin, anyone posting in here, and the world 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:36:52
What correction? Seriously, it's getting annoying when the price goes down less than a percent and you guys (I assume margin traders) start going on about a correction. Going from 12,900 to 12,800 is normal market fluctuation. Please stop. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:46:16
You may not feel that way in a month (or sooner)
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:06:02
Sounds expensive. Do it 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:12:55
When did I say that it isn't a bubble right now? bitcoin is like a long term risky savings account for me. I will be just fine no matter what happens
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:44:52
Bitcoin has gone up 400% after my mother in law told me that holding bitcoin would lead to me "being hacked"
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:05:03
Bitcoin seems to be done? What? 
Did you already forget 1,200 to 150 and back?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:45:45
It works functionally better than fiat in many ways. Crypto is here to stay. The question is, is bitcoin here to stay?
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:58:50

Your last two lines revealed you to be the hater that you are. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:05:54
I see this post every dip and I lol every time. Unfortunately you won't be posting that you were wrong when price recovers...

No, it means if you borrow money you will owe less when you pay it back

People said the same thing at 100, at 1000, at 2800, and now at 4000. This is the tip of the iceberg.
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:44:40
That's not out of the realm of possibility

It was 5 fucking dollars to send bitcoin to my sportsbook website before the McGregor fight 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:55:42
I mean you bought at an ATH... sort of comes with the territory
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:05:18
That's the way to do it! 
I first bought at 1000 a few years ago... watched it go from 1200 to 200 and now here we are at 4000. Enjoy it, it's a helluva ride 
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:11:26
Being that Coinbase is such a huge player with bitcoin, it makes it an issue with bitcoin too. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:09:43
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:05:45
That isn't true at all
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:24:31
Not if you bought a couple hours ago 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:05:13
To the moon!
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:53:54
A few months ago we were 2800 and then it dipped down to 2000 and people, likely people new to bitcoin, were saying they couldn't believe they bought into this mess, that they were considering selling. Don't be those people. Bitcoin is volatile as fuck but it will continue to trend upwards. This dip is normal for the course. Generally the multiple days of 100+ rises in price will mean a correction is coming soon, which is where bitcoin was at when you bought. Just wait a month or two and we should be well past 5000
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:00:48
Don’t feed the troll
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:39:23
Fuck Kim Dotcom, total cult of personality figure. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:33:14
Yeah, if anyone is shocked by drops they are either new, or haven't been paying attention! I remember when it recently hit 1000 and then went down to 750 briefly. Then weeks later we're hitting 2000+
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:52:28
A dip is just a chance to stock up more for cheap. Enjoy it boys, I'm hoping it goes lower so I can pick up even more coins 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:59:47
This isn't really a major recession. It could be back up to 2800 today. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:27:06
Put 5k in bitcoin and hodl. If you put it all in bitcoin good luck. Human nature dictates that you will likely sell when the price goes down, and lose a bunch of money
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:36:31
I was also thinking troll could be a possibility. The logic in his article needs enough help to make me question him being a troll. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:12:36
panic sellers gonna panic sell though, especially noobies. I am HODLING until I am forced to sell them
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:57:16
So what you are saying is.. hodl? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:50:01
I bought some for that too! And then gambled them away at 200. Learned my lesson to HODL and enjoy the bumpy ride
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:46:30
Bitcoin is still up about 100 dollars from 24h ago. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:10:39
Ah cool. I have a hunch it'll be there pretty soon!
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:41:55
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:56:22
Same man. I don't see bitcoin going away and the price is gonna skyrocket when it really catches on. Supply and demand. People who are holding coins now are gonna be rich in 10 years 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:00:53
I hope you didn't sell it low. Supposed to buy low and sell high!
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:47:41
Even if this turns out OK for you it's still a dumb move. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:54:49
I wouldn't be too concerned with it unless you're day trading. Bitcoin is gonna bitcoin. This is normal 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:27:08
Mess?! You guys really are new 
@_date: 2017-07-11 17:14:18
Buy high and sell low amirite? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:53:49
I won't miss out on more cheap coins!!!
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:50:22
If posts could be vaporware, your posts would definitely be vaporware. Just post the fucking videos

I don't really care about what he thinks. At all 
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:14:19
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:46:22
The crazy thing is for every one of us that has bought in, there are waaaaay more people like the one OP texted. People coming into bitcoin now are still early adopters. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 20:28:42
I don't know if it's lucky. OP chose to hodl 
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:58:04
Eh, with inflation over many decades you never know 
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:38:54
So what would happen to my coins in my wallet after a user activated soft fork? Would I be holding 'old coins?'
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:48:22
There is a soft-fork upcoming and it will more than likely result in lower prices as people sell off before. 
Could be a chance for cheap coins then, but nothing is guaranteed of course. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:11:44
Bitcoin in its nature is decentraized and peer to peer. That is how it works. 
Personally I like to gamble some of it and hodl the rest of it. I have not sold any bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-06-17 03:40:51
steel beams 
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:07:29
I updated my above post because it had some errors but basically being peer to peer and decentralized offers something that fiat or stocks or bonds can't really offer. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:34:21
Thank you for the analysis, you should edit that part into your OP 
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:07:24
Oh, gotcha. I mean it will happen. But when? If it goes up to 5000 in July and then back down to 2800 in August it's a major recession but still huge gains from earlier this year 
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:24:17
Those graphs are useful but they are not crystal balls, you might be right but I think it's way less certain than you think. I will be hodling 
@_date: 2017-06-09 04:20:07
Use Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:46:18
Shill is easily the most overused word on Reddit. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:22:32
I mean this wasn't unexpected. I think most here knew it would cool off for a bit. Mark was right about it being overvalued (for now), having said that, he doesn't really seem to understand the technology
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:57:43
Even if places aren't accepting it as a form of payment, the price history itself is pretty self-explanatory as to why people buy it. It has been fantastic for long term investing. it isn't tied to your local government which offers unique value for any investor. Cryptocurrency is still fairly new but it hasn't gone away because it offers something to people that fiat can't. Bitcoin is useful in quite a few ways - being peer to peer and decentralized is what drives it forward, is what I'm getting at
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:16:10
It's never wrong advice. Investing 101 says that you always diversify your portfolio to reduce risk. You can disregard that if you wish, and it could work out for you if you're lucky, but it's a lot less safe and you stand to lose more. I'm as high on bitcoin as most people here, but I'm not banking my retirement 100% on bitcoin, I can tell you that much. High risk/return investments are fun and can make you rich, but they're dangerous and at this point you can't call bitcoin anything other than high risk/return.
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:21:38
I'm not shocked that bitcoin had a volatile day with a big dip in value. I'm shocked that people are so surprised, this was expected and normal. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:42:19
Yeah. It sucks. But we could easily be above 3000 later this week. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:12:21
The question is if those people will stay, or leave when a major crash comes (it's coming). If people continue to use it and value it as a way to set something aside, it still has plenty of value and 21 million bitcoin isn't a whole lot to go around. Honestly 3000 could be low for a year from now (though I believe 10k and upwards is still years away)
@_date: 2017-06-22 02:54:46
I don't think this state wants their own coin. They want businesses coming in using the blockchain to know they will look out for them and make sure they don't get taxed to hell or regulated out of the state.
