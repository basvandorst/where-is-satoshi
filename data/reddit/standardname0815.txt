How many Satoshi are 50 cent? 50 cent = Satoshi confirmed? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:24:54
Just wait until it exits post only mode :D
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:28:37
Because it's frozen
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:10:37
Or maybe 50k...Everything seems possible today...
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:12:31
The meme-pool is full again, so to speak :p
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:42:47
Yes. Bcash will crash when trading is enabled again
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:25:08
Sorry but what is that "bitcoin cash" you are talking about? It doesn't seem to exist.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:25:36
Is it fiat? We'll find out...soon...
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:13:08
Because trading stopped
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:36:35
It hit 19k on gdax
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:00:56
Exactly. I say double the figures!
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:56:20
Oh I love tatoos. Maybe you could share it with us? :p
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:03:54
Did you pay your pizza with BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:12:30
For checking bitcoin charts? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:35
20k in a few minutes probably
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:41:16
Don't daytrade crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:07:42
Exactly my thoughts
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:32:10
Ok what's going on? That doesn't feel right anymore...now 18k again in seconds after it went to 19k in seconds...
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:00:17
Even better: make a fork off the bcash chain, and call it bscam
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:45:28
In my experience: unless you are a big investor (and a experienced daytrader) you will get crushed.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:22:35
Taco hell xD
Fitting at the moment
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:58:33
1 btc is actually around 5.1 million Zimbabwe dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:41
Wtf is happening?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:30:11
It's post only mode for at least one hour apparently. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:48:29
That Tesla that they are going to announce in 2030?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:12:34
How is that even possible? If there are fewer BTC than users have bought or deposited, then someone stole them...
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:59:31


Was that supposed to say "To help further market nanipulation"?
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:40:02
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:46:50
I wouldn't do anything but hodl under these conditions. Everything else would be suicide.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:05
Holy shit
2 minutes now??
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:56:13


@_date: 2017-12-07 17:28:10
Always hodl
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:10:07
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:49:05


Well... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:34:44
False flag attack
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:29:34
What coin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:06:18
They are waiting for people foolish enough to place more buy orders.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:49:08
I really loke those unexpected plot twists
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:09:33
Well the chart itself was still moving until a few seconds ago...
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:50:08
Huh? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:04:19
It's already down to 4000
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:46:08
200% ... completely ridiculous
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:53:58
Yeah sure. Talking anout greed in crypto some other person comes to mind...
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:51:30
I'll give you 5$ ok?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:11:50
So all major exchanges are under attack? Or is it just the insane trading volume?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:05:50
Is it just me or is the "book" view on gdax frozen?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:41:20
Not funny if you have a weak stomach. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:35:24
You think they didn't outsource "customer service" to some call center?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:30:33


@_date: 2014-06-25 15:35:02
Just send them 1 million $ and they will do the rest for you.
@_date: 2017-03-08 23:18:14
Oh damn. I read this as “Bitcoin surpasses 10.000$"... 
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:56:40
Oh thats ridiculous...
That will only happen next week...but not today... :p
@_date: 2019-10-26 20:32:24
Please eat a bag of sugar.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:56:36
Now 6200
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:28:12
My thoughts exactly.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:42:11
You know that Nostradamus was a fraud right?
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:53:14
Seems like it.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:19:18
Satoshi? :p
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:42:53
Thats so wrong. Why are there bears in the picture? Should be bulls!
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:14:45
Only 35 millionaires? :p
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:09:50
Hi mr redditor for 2 days...
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:49:05
That's about the 100th time someone has posted this now.
This was probably prepared beforehand to spread more FUD. Or why didn't they share it on more visible channels than pastebin back then?
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:53:04
Yes that's what I mean. Why not share it via reddit, Twitter, wherever back then, if they knew and wanted us to know too? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:36:14
Yeah sure new user...
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:05:28
A love triangle?
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:31:46
And why isn't that a tesla???
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:44:19
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:37:43
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:36:34
That would be reddit mold
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:47:25
"Bitcoin dot com" as a source?
Then it has to be true /s
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:44:19
That whole pastebin entry is FUD carefully prepared beforehand. If the author really wanted to warn us a few months ago why not use a more visible service? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:07:46
I want my overpriced selfdriving car... now!
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:45:17
That's what I was thinking. There is no logical reason for this massive rise. Nothing changed.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:35:54
For pumping his coin there too?
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:14:14
The fork happened months ago.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:58:53
My guess is that he will buy back in cheap, using the profits from dumping that other coin once the pump there is over.
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:55:32
Oh you are so wrong. Actually it's 81. :p
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:00:50
Well.. he's lost to the other side now :/
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:11:16
Full or half moon?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:42:45
Strange...as soon as it's back up the BTC manipulation starts again...
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:48:10
You posted this the second time now within 5 minutes...
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:08:53
Or: 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:25:34
50k BTC for 1 USD? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:57:54
That needs to stop or he will kill all of crypto,  especially with the current market situation... 
@_date: 2017-07-12 18:03:10
I'll do it for 20 :p
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:05:23
Oh i though it was a treadmill-powered miner :p
