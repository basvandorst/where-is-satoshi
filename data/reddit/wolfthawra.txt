Yeah but there's a difference between buying when prices are currently skyrocketing, and buying when there is just a steady increase of the mean.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:20:33
Whenever prices for something are increasing exponentially, it is unsustainable with a very very high probability. You can still make money on it of course, but you have to be aware that it will trend back down soon, so it's extremely easy to miss the right time to sell. So basically, at that point the risk is *much* higher than normal.
It doesn't mean the whole thing will necessarily crash and burn completely, but a 'correction' is likely. So the 'right time to buy' depends a lot on how much risk you're willing, and able, to take. If losing 30% or more in two weeks or whatever is acceptable because you're in it for the long haul, and you don't actually need the money you invested back urgently at any point, then you don't need to care if your overall opinion is that it will rise above that over the next year or whatever.

How exactly would BTC store value?
@_date: 2016-03-26 00:59:07
This has nothing to do with 'shitty money management'. At all.

I wouldn't say that's a particularly fast response to an issue of a missing $2.5k. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:57:04
At some point, you got to ask yourself: could you possibly do something positive with the same amount of effort, and actually amount to something at some point?
@_date: 2019-02-02 09:26:53
Decentralised, eh?
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:52:24
Why put so much effort into making yourself as unpleasant as possible? Actual assholes just don't care, you're *trying* way too hard. Not getting enough attention otherwise?
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:49:49
So I'm confused, is your goal to appear like a complete asshole, or what? Why?
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:47:02
Could you try and put some more words in there that scream "I am a complete asshole"?
@_date: 2019-02-27 15:09:22
Dude, that insult was already lame the first time around. But it confirms my diagnosis - people only register your existence when you act like an asshole. Unfortunately you're not even good at that, so this got boring way too quickly. Bye, loser.
@_date: 2019-02-27 10:12:17
Oh god just fuck off.

Except he's not, it's still astrology.

Shockingly, I did know that about my own username, yes.
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:59:51
Duh - if you know exactly where the bottom is, buy there.

My guess was on Zimbabwe Dollars.
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:04:59
Yeah that's not a fair comparison. What's the maximum it can go up? Well, there is no limit. What's the maximum it can go down? 100%. It can't possibly fall more than that. So in any such comparison, the down trend is always going to look 'measly' when compared to the billion percent rise that went beforehand.
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:13:21
Of course not, it's true.
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:13:45
Oh dear. You say that in the bitcoin subreddit?
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:53:05
It's still as correct as back then.
@_date: 2019-01-16 14:37:12
How will it make my life easier?

What exactly does the surveillance state have to do with it?


... I thought we were talking about paying in bitcoin vs just paying by card or cash. Not sure what on earth this has to do with it.
@_date: 2019-01-31 16:04:05
Yeah that's what I thought, that's how that usually works. Not exactly what you wrote though.
@_date: 2019-01-31 15:57:47


I'm not sure how you think that works, but I'm fairly sure that it's not how it really works.
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:31:20


Isn't it kind of one of the central features of the whole blockchain thing that comes with bitcoin that everyone can look at the transactions and verify them?
Or am I misunderstanding this?
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:36:25


Question from an outsider to all the cryptocurrency stuff - I know 'fiat' is generally defined as a currency issued by a government and not backed by a commodity. It's called 'fiat' because it is based on trust, from the latin word, as I understand it.
So how does a cryptocurrency differ from that substantially? Yes it's not initiated by a government, but in the end, it's value is entirely based on trust too. It's not a commodity currency, it's not representative, it's worth something pretty much because people believe in and agree on it being worth something. Right?
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:20:44
Well I didn't want to be unkind.
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:14:37


Yeah that doesn't mean it's profitable for normal people on their home computers though. Not everyone can afford to invest into an array of graphics cards.

He most likely murdered his neighbour, and he is guilty of *at least* sexual assault.
Sounds like a great guy to trust.
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:19:35
Fiat has countries backing it, bitcoin has nothing except people believing in it. So no.

Also, something like Facebook scales relatively easily to 50 million users. Planes need to, you know, be fucking built first, and operated, and maintained, and fuelled, and so on.
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:45:34
Oh my god, you're literally just a pile of buzzwords. Do yourself a favour, go back to basics and figure out what each word actually means. Hint: it's generally not what you seem to think.
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:20:22
You're thinking of 'free markets', not 'capitalism'. At least get the terminology right.
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:34:17
This is why we don't live in capitalism? What?? 
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:13:46
I myself like to stop short of murder and sexual assault, but of course that's a purely personal preference.
@_date: 2018-04-08 11:49:26
I think he's a little bit beyond 'eccentric'.
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:20:11
Also, you know, bitcoin is created out of nothing. There is technical limit imposed on it, and it's made so that you have to spend money to get it, but it's not like it actually creates value anywhere. If you look at the overall system, what you've done is use lots of energy to shift some bits around, and it only works as long as people believe in it being something valuable.
I have to say, I continue to be confused by this anti-fiat attitude in the crypto community, when crypto is one of the most fiat things I've ever seen. Like, you can argue the advantages over classic banking systems all you want, in the end, it can be as decentralised as you like, and as widely used as you want, etc., but it's still entirely based on people believing it has a worth.
I'm not saying that's inherently bad at all. I'm just confused why that is somehow used as an argument against non-crypto currencies.

Well that depends on whether his future pay depends on customer satisfaction. The point is that with some clever thinking, there's a way to present the facts that help most possible conclusions you could want to get. Not all, of course, but most.
'The truth' is not as simple as some people wish it was. Lots of times, there are actually several equally justified ways of presenting data, depending on what your perspective is.

You get a lot more everything if you buy it before hyperinflation occurs. That's how hyperinflation works.
