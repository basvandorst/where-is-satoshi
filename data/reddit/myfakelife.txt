Why do you have to be a dick? This entire subreddit has pretentious neck beards all over it.
I forgot why I stopped checking this subreddit long ago.

It's now a site wide feature

It's the closest thing we have to Bitcoin's scale, I don't know exactly what other alt could be used with the amount of users needed.

It's got real users, not a lot, but enough to see if Segwit would work.

I mean, it's kind of true. You should know what you're investing in and what variables to look out for when trading.
Chinese traders have always been a factor.

That still makes it a factor. Did I stutter?
@_date: 2017-01-13 00:42:10
I'm extremely confused about why we wouldn't increase the block size.

Add a CAPTCHA

That is absolutely how it works, I've sent a transaction that got stuck for 12 hours, so I just sent it again from another wallet and that transaction got accepted before the original and the original became invalid.

Best. Miner fee. Ever.

Ask shift if they'll take a personal order to link a tax ID rather than a SSN and a business name. They can also increase your spending limit.
