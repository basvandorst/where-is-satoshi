Yes, but this is very poor implementation of those regulations.
Nobody would go to jail if they sold this guy the coins he wants to buy (if what he is saying is the whole story).

I understand what you're saying but I disagree that its spam. I'm here standing by my content and trying to be engaging. I've put a lot of work in to it and I'm just trying to get some feedback.

I'm doing it on my computer.
The issue happens in both safari and chrome.
I've tried it repeatedly, and very, very occasionally I get the SSO confirm screen instead of the error screen I described.
But when I okay the SSO changetip says "nothing to do for user 'reddit'"
Can you confirm that I have BTC to withdrawal from changetip?
Thank you for looking at this!
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:12:01
I have some tips that I sent that have never been claimed. I emailed changetip asking if they'd they'd let me have them but they never responded. Probably ~ .1 BTC

But the SSO isn't working any more :/ Reddit says:
bad request (reddit.com)
you sent an invalid request
— invalid redirect_uri parameter.
I tried to manually input &amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2F in to the URL but it says the same thing.

Hi Everyone, just a heads up that I'm running out of bits for this campaign, please upvote this if you see it so others know I'm out of bits to pay.
Thank you so much for your support with your social interaction and reviewing and feedback of my site. This weekend I'm going to sift through the feedback and make some tasks for action items on the site, and then next week I'm going to start cold calling companies to get some advertisers on the site.
If things even go just a tiny bit well, I'll be back in a couple weeks with new ways to have you interact for the site for bitcoin.
Being able to do things like this is only possible because of bitcoin. Coordinating anonymous payments would be just too difficult with any other medium. I'm hoping to demonstrate that to people as a way of getting them more interested in bitcoin.

Its a real problem. We just need more apps.
Last year a contractor in asia and I gave paypal $2,500 including fees. This year we've spent about $100 including moving in/out of fiat when needed.
The current financial system probably skims over 5% of your money from you but they hide it very well.
It cost me over $1,000 to get remittances from my customer in Australia this year.
If there we're just a slightly larger bitcoin financial network in place, I (and you) would get to keep all that money. I wouldn't have to pay as much to my suppliers, and I could carge you less money.

I know nearly nothing about the bitcoin mining software, but clearly what they've done is either enabled an option or modified the software to no include transactions in to the blocks they mine.
@_date: 2015-12-07 18:42:32
Thanks for looking at it! It only prompts for the address when a click pays. You're right, I do need to make a page that shows payouts.

You don't have to use this method, its just the fastest. You can opt for them to make a couple small deposits in your account and then you tell them how much the deposits were for, but it sometimes takes a while for the deposits to appear.
Also, FYI paypal has this exact same functionality.
@_date: 2015-12-07 18:16:20
Thanks for the feedback!
The only reason to sign up is if you want to buy pixels, and we'd have to communicate regarding publishing, so we'd need an email address.
I thought about using a login URL but researching it I found that people would contact support because they lost the URL.
I'll look in to implementing it as an option so you could log in either way.
@_date: 2015-12-07 17:56:04
why not give it a try? I just gave away 5,000 bits for a click. At least at first its a manual process on my side as I see how people use it.
@_date: 2015-12-09 20:33:13


Its just the nature of people. Its like if you see a tip jar with money in it you're more likely to tip.
Hiding the scores stops the runaway herd voting, but introduces the opposite problem of people not voting.
@_date: 2015-12-04 22:39:45
Nice, gonna have to start using this.
@_date: 2015-12-10 12:22:59
Sure! I have enough to pay for a couple more blog posts, if you do a nice blog post for my site I can pay 100,000 bits just send me a link to the blog post!
@_date: 2015-12-08 03:47:50
Everyone's score is hidden in now.
@_date: 2015-12-07 18:26:58
Yep, nothing is required for bitcoin payout except for a wallet address. Again, creating an account only revolves around buying pixels on the site, not earning bitcoin by clicking.
I just put up a 3000 bit giveaway, hurry and you can claim it!

Yeah, it only occasionally pays for a click ([see the fourth question on the About Us FAQ](
I really appreciate you looking at it.
@_date: 2016-01-30 18:03:08
At this moment in bitcoin history, your observation that it can be difficult to acquire is accurate.
You must get them from somewhere or someone. The easiest way to do that is to buy them.
The hope is that in the future more people will have them and then they will be easier to trade. People like you getting interested in them is will what will make that happen. Please keep learning about bitcoin and it will succeed!

Are you in the states? If you're fully qualified Coinbase will buy up to 50k / day from you.
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:20:14
Sure, but the transaction isn't settled yet. The merchant doesn't have the money in that instant. In bitcoin speak, the transaction is on the ledger, but it hasn't yet been confirmed.
If you want to buy with someone who accepts 0 confirmations, the transaction is instant, just like you're saying happens with your credit card.
@_date: 2016-02-18 02:23:56
Looks like its a bit of both: 
The link on the left has some (I guess runnable?) demos, but the one on the right is is a link to the linux foundation's hyperledger project.
Is it a trap? I don't know. But its certainly interesting what they are doing.

I tried to use my btc and 1-800-flowers.com but they don't take it any more or something? Couldn't find the pay with bitcoin interface.
They announced about a year ago that they take bitcoin, I was sad!
