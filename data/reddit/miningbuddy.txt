Yes, it stinks. Conflict of interest and breaking our sub reddit rules. This 'co-founder' should be ashamed. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 13:22:27
So basically according this this post by the admins ( is due to moderators being bad at passwords. 
I use a password manager to generate a 25 character unique password for reddit, not that my account has permission to change CSS here. I think my account is safe.

It's just not as simple as that, you're still weather restricted and there will be some kind of cost involved with maintaining the solar setup somewhere down the line. 
Don't get me wrong, it's a great concept but it's more of a novelty then anything else, much like the USB miners themselves. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 20:04:05


I've been using the same USB drive every few days for nearly 9 years now and it's never skipped a beat.

It's a good concept but yeah, from a profit point of view it's useless, just the USB sticks alone are unlikely to ever pay for themselves.

It's cat and mouse with these guys. As soon as we blacklist them another pops up just as quick. 
Still, we are removing all the crap we see and reports help out a tonne so thank you for helping out.

I think the AutoModerator bot removed it again. It's back now.

Is this the start of 2008 all over again?
@_date: 2014-02-11 13:09:22
I had a withdraw go to finished then failed. Tried again and it said finished after 10 mins or so then took around 2 hours for the btc to hit the network. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:06:14
I was talking about the USB miners in your picture, nothing else.  
Those miners will be unlikely to ever return the initial amount of btc used to purchase by mining, that's with free power, not including the cost for solar panels and controllers etc, so again, this setup is not profitable. 
You are much better off just straight up buying/holding the same amount of bitcoins that you would normally spend on this unit. 
Power bill is not the most money invested when you start mining, cost of the mining hardware is.
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:22:47
They don't contain a private key, these are just for novelty. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 11:29:39
Why should you be an exception to the rules?
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:08:17
Your setup does not provide free power. You still had to purchase the solar panels and everything else associated with them.

It's Bitcoin, you create a bitcoin account on their site just like any other currency they offer, then you use an approved exchanger to add bitcoin to your account.

@_date: 2015-01-08 08:55:48
There's a sub for too
@_date: 2014-01-07 08:30:03
Extracted automatically? I find this hard to believe, can someone else confirm?
@_date: 2015-01-08 07:07:54
Price is from Coindesk, from their mytrezor.com

It's another scam of Josh Garza. He claims he has nothing to do with the site yet all packages to date have been gifted from Josh's Amazon account.

Get it replaced, don't risk it. Also, post to @_date: 2015-03-23 01:53:37

Anything could have happened to it. While it is likely that customs just took a peek inside I personally would not want to take the risk of the device being tampered with in any way at all.
@_date: 2015-03-23 02:29:05
He managed to get removed/listed as private too.  
Any kind of criticism or questioning his actions results in being swept under the carpet.

Shame Mark squats on more bitcoin related domains then he does developing them. 
@_date: 2013-10-05 10:43:39
Idk, mine was a 30-something character long password from lastpass, pretty hard to remember :P 
Edit*: sharing your old passwords is probably a bad idea.

Not an admin but a mod here and there, I haven't heard anything for a few days, the last message from theymos was October 10th

Fair enough, all the best to you.

You should login and change your old password at least.

Op is correct, the logo animation post is on the front page of at the moment, being logged in or not doesn't make a difference to (you can test this yourself) :)
@_date: 2013-08-21 14:30:44
Yeah, these guys are rather persistent with their spam around here. I've asked for a ban on that domain but in the meantime please keep reporting them. Thanks
@_date: 2013-05-01 12:12:19
Can't hurt to do both.

Hi, when you report something it is removed from the reporters feed and added to the mod queue, other people can still see it In their feed until a moderator takes action. 
We try to keep ontop of the mod queue so reporting really helps. 
Thanks again.
