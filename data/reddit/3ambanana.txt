The market will do what most are not expecting. Btc shorts have increased 55% recently...what do you think is in store for the short term? Then of course we go down more. I think we’re in denial

Since you can’t call the tops and bottoms look at how you would have performed if you were holding. If you were holding the Dow in 2008 you lost 34% on the year; and if you were holding GLD shares, you lost 30%.

I think based on the breakout shown here most people will be going long, many are applying TA to this market despite the manipulation we’ve seen

Yes. You can play the game as long as you understand the rules. Too many people in the buy high / sell low community

Look at what happened to the price of gold in the 2008 crash. It crashed just like everything else bc there is a run on liquidity when margin calls come. Gold is not a hedge against the stock market crashing; it is a hedge against economic uncertainty.

It’s very surprising that he didn’t even mention that btc shorts were at an all time high before this pump. It comes across as a gross misunderstanding of the marketplace when he mentions that the pump “must have happened” because other people were “thinking like him” during the weeks of sideways trading prior to the pump
