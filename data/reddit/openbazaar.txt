I think this will be the first use case for OpenBazaar. I miss BitMit and this is ideal to replace it.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:04:16
can talk more about this, but we are planning on having a WoT model to ensure good community ratings and reputations. However, I don't think it will directly use any preexisting models, it will likely start from the ground up.
But remember that this is open source and anyone can use it as they please. If some people in the community want the Bitcoin OTC I'm sure it can be implemented.
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:36:44
What you're describing is that Ebay is a mediator, a trusted third party that handles disputes.
OpenBazaar has that as well, except instead of only having one arbiter that you are forced to use (Ebay themselves), there is a market of arbiters to choose from. 
This uses Bitcoin multisig, so that an arbiter will control the distribution of funds without being able to steal them. And this only happens if the buyer and seller don't agree, meaning most trade will occur without the mediator doing anything at all.
@_date: 2014-08-08 15:50:43
Wonderful! Please send along an email to project and we'll take advantage of your kind offer.
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:31:19
The goal is to have DHTs hold the listings for offline nodes. How long they will last I don't know. Right now, OpenBazaar will definitely work better if the user is online, but we're trying to craft it so that it isn't necessary all the time.
By the way, I'm also working on getting this up and running on a Raspberry Pi, so in the future you have that option.
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:34:19
Thanks Amir, for your initial work and for your thoughts. If you ever get some free time, look through the code as it stand now and drop in our IRC room to chat about it, we'd love your insight.
@_date: 2014-08-08 16:35:56
Well said. Suits, squatters, and everyone in between benefit from Bitcoin and the platforms we build around it.
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:37:04
We've discussed an optional Proof of Burn for creating pseudonyms, and the web of trust will put a higher value on pseudonyms that choose the proof of burn. Preventing sybil attacks, spamming, and sock puppets is something we discuss a lot, it's not easy in a decentralized and anonymous system.
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:00:01
We aren't taking a narrow view of catering to a small subset of the population. We want this platform to be used by everyone.
At first, we expect it will be a BitMit on steroids for the community. Then it will expand to people defecting from Ebay and other platforms.
The reputation system will work in such a way that people can block out anything their don't morally agree with, in fact, we expect the community to have a strong self-policing aspect.
But censorship isn't possible with the decentralized design, and we're not apologizing for that. It's a feature, not a bug.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:40:35
Thanks for your support! I just answered this question elsewhere: 






















@_date: 2014-08-08 15:54:29
People run nodes to access the network. True for buyers, sellers, and notaries, you can't get into the network unless you're running a node (or connecting to a gateway that is running a node).
Apart from that, people might run nodes for the same reason they run Tor relays, or Bitcoin nodes. Or they might be a notary that makes money from dispute resolution.
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:14:48
Optional. It'll probably give people the choice when they launch the client.
This is meant to be a platform for anyone to use, and not all users care as deeply about their privacy as others, so we're letting users decide how private they want to be.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:24:53
Here's the project roadmap: 






@_date: 2014-08-08 04:20:47
Wonderful questions. We need people like you to open issues on Github. Speaking of which:
* We're [working]( to separate orders now.
* As of now, separately, although Bitmessage isn't required for OpenBazaar to function. It's just one option to use for communication of private messages.
* It's like you're a [mind-reader]( Direct transactions will be an option eventually.
* Surety bonds are something we definitely want, but haven't gone beyond theory yet. It's probably a ways down the road, unless we have more developers jump in and help build it! 
Bonus answer: Here's where we're at with reputation, coding the system now: 
@_date: 2014-06-20 00:14:05
Imagine a battle between Captain Planet and the Power Rangers. Power Rangers win, hands down.
Anyways, you make an excellent point and one of our guiding principles is that OpenBazaar should be simple enough to use that anyone who engages in online commerce now (on Ebay, Amazon, wherever), should be able to find OpenBazaar as simple or even easier to use than the platforms they already use.
By the time it launches, even a borderline imbecile like you can use it.

I think NXT is more for buying and selling crypto. OpenBazaar is meant to be for buying and selling goods and services. Decentralized eBay.

@_date: 2014-08-08 04:11:58
Send us an email at project and we'll make sure this happens. Depending on your tech knowledge it might be a little while before you can run a node, but we'll get there eventually.
Plus, we want to learn from you. We need to learn from the people using it.

I don't know about gift cards specifically, but Dr. Sanchez has talked about issuing and transferring shares on OpenBazaar:
As well as p2p lending:
These are theory, but we hope they will be implementable later.
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:12:55
Hey thanks! We are so excited for beta to launch so everyone can check it out. I mean, it'll still be buggy, but at least then we'll have people submitting bug reports and helping make it better.
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:41:43
Can't say for the beta. We want the full release to be easy enough that anyone who currently does online commerce could easily switch over.
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:18:13
That's the spirit! I really believe that this is the power of a platform like OpenBazaar. Community-based trade with no barriers.
@_date: 2014-08-08 02:06:28
The internet decentralized communications. 
Bitcoin decentralized money. 
We need decentralized trade, and we're building it.
So yes, it's **HUGE**.

Hey, thanks!

@_date: 2014-08-08 04:09:20
We're still working out details on this, so stay tuned. 
But one idea we had was this: since the Ricardian contracts used are small JSON files, you could basically create something like a magnet link for commerce. Any website could host their product on their normal website storefront, but clicking on the magnet link would open the listing within the OpenBazaar client.
In other words, you won't be limited to searching within the OpenBazaar network itself, products could be distributed on the web, over email, bitmessage, anywhere.
@_date: 2014-08-08 01:09:12
Beta end of August.
1.0 release December.
let's make trade free, together.
**Edit**: You guys are awesome. We'll be heading out for tonight, but if you want to be altered to beta testing and get announcements, please sign up for our [mailing list here](

OpenBazaar is a fork of the Dark Market, created by Amir and the Airbitz and Libbitcoin team.
He's not actively developing OpenBazaar, but he's aware of the project, let us use a section of the unSYSTEM forums for OpenBazaar, pointed the Dark Market Github toward OpenBazaar, and occasionally hops into the IRC channel. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 13:49:41
Yes, a big thanks to Amir and the team at the Toronto hackathon that started this.
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:16:27
Yeah creating incentives for development is something we'd like to do. If you know a simple way to do that now, let me know.
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:20:11
Sorry to just throw links at you (crazy busy right now!), but here's our documentation on the subject.
@_date: 2014-08-08 02:35:53
Keep the faith Brother (or Sister)!
We'll need beta testers come Sept-Dec, so get as many people as you can to test it out and submit all the problems you have.

The development roadmap should help here:




















I would recommend emailing us at project Brian can give you a more in-depth response.
@_date: 2014-08-08 02:56:33
Yeah, everyone take it easy on that, we're not fully functional yet and the Reddit Hug is already slowing down the network.
So feel free to check it out, but just know that if it's super slow or buggy, that's because we're not finished yet!
@_date: 2014-06-20 01:32:01
Yeah I hear you. I'm sure when we're closer to having a final product we'll create more mainstream ads, but for now we are trying to get more developers and those types often find the censorship and surveillance resistance as more appealing than the lack of fees.
We'll keep this in mind as we grow!
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:04:49
Thank you! We have plans to keep rockin' on. It's in our development roadmap.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:17:53
Here's the project roadmap: 






@_date: 2014-08-08 13:45:24
We are definitely going to need explanation and tutorial videos. project if you've got ideas.
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:52:41
We're trying to get the technology in place first, not worrying about marketing or any of that yet (except for keeping Bitcoiners informed).
If we eventually have a "BitMit on steroids" platform running well, then we go for mainstream. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 02:01:16
Yes, we plan on writing tutorials for getting nodes up, and having walkthrough videos as well. It's a good idea to make them specific to the use case, so we'll put some thought into that.
We are going to learn so much from the community through the beta test, we can't wait.
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:06:50
We are mostly using Python, so that'd be the best language to learn, it's good for beginners anyways.
But learning how to use Github, and Git, is probably the best place to start. You can fork the project, try to run it yourself, and then report bugs on the Github page.
If you need help doing any of this, ask for help in the IRC channel  on Freenode.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:27:49
We have specifically discussed this. We inherited the current license from the Dark Market folks, so we have to work with them to change it. But I think moving to a MIT license is something we are actively considering.
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:52:46
Yes, the listings will use keywords and you can filter out the keywords. Merchants can voluntarily list their geographic location and you can filter that way as well.
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:36:15
Hey, good question.
In OpenBazaar, the third parties will be chosen in a marketplace by buyer and seller, which has a reputation system in place. And it's not a simple system that can be trivially gamed, [read the paper]( on what we're building.
Trusting a third party isn't unique to OpenBazaar anyway, essentially all commerce online is done this way. The difference is, you will get to choose who that third party is on OpenBazaar, and you will base that decision on market information.
@_date: 2014-08-08 04:26:25
No it's a decentralized network, openbazaar.org does nothing in the network at all.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:57:21
Are you familiar with using Github? That's the best way to do it. Download everything, build the dependencies, try running it, and when you hit a snag come ask for help in the IRC, and if we can't walk you through it then open an issue on the Github page.
At this point it's still early so you do need a decent amount of knowledge to get it running at all. In a few months it should be much easier and bug testing will be more helpful then.
@_date: 2014-08-08 01:34:00
...combined with the best of BitTorrent. 
Yeah, we can't wait either.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:19:03
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that. Do you have a link?
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:41:51
It's up to users to comply with their conscience and legal jurisdictions. We're creating a technology that people can use in many different ways.
But to answer your question, yes, it could make trade much easier, and it is one of our goals to do so. By using Ricardian contracts, the trade is both machine and human readable, and is extremely flexible. You wouldn't need to change the contract based on geography. 
However, if both parties want to include extra details so that they are legally bound to a shared jurisdiction, they can do that as well. It's all about giving users options to take care of trade however they see fit.
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:53:53
If they want to view the network, or offer their own goods, they will have to run a node.
Also, arbiters that handle trade disputes will likely want to run nodes for their own benefit.
@_date: 2014-06-20 00:16:23
It's something we're aware of and we are trying to consider ways to jumpstart the more mainstream uses so that illicit uses don't scare those people from ever using the platform. If you have ideas, we're happy to hear them!
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:33:40
The goal is to incorporate Tor, so in theory tracking nodes would be very difficult to do. Also, stores can use encryption and not offer listings to the public broadly.
Our goal is to create a platform that is significantly more resistant to surveillance and censorship than any previous method of online commerce.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:21:15
Brian mentioned this here:


@_date: 2014-08-08 02:16:24
Not for beta. Tor will be integrated, but likely it will be optional.
@_date: 2014-08-08 15:49:56
Maybe once we get better drones? Who knows. The groundwork needs to be laid first anyway.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:13:32
The bootstrapping question is a good one, and we can't predict the future. However, we are getting significant interest from people who want to use the platform now, before it's even out of Alpha! We think there is demand for a marketplace with no fees and no censorship.
I expect one of the first uses will be a community replacement for BitMit, where average Bitcoiners have a place to buy and sell goods for bitcoin easily.
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:59:05
Maybe! We need your help though. Once the beta rolls out, we need people testing it and submitting all the bugs and making suggestions for improvement until it's spinning like a top.
This isn't a forgone conclusion, we need development help and community testing before it can become something reliable enough to actually go mainstream.
But if the community steps up and developers pitch in, then yes, I think we will change the world, for the better.
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:09:55
It's not a website, you're a node in a decentralized network pulling in product listings from other nodes. So "browsing" isn't quite the same thing as with existing platforms.
But with the full release we will have Tor integrated, so users will be pseudonymous by using Tor. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:43:11
No plans for making money from it, don't even know how we'd do that.
Arbiters handling disputes will get paid fees, so I suppose someone will be making money from it apart from just buying and selling.
There's no advertising. Good Lord, there is NO advertising.
@_date: 2014-08-08 02:14:26
Tor will be integrated.
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:03:07
Could you give us an example of this?
@_date: 2014-08-08 15:40:12
Anyone can. If we put out an update that took control of the network, people wouldn't update their software, and we'd have a new fork the next day. Open source is powerful.
We're not going to do that though.
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:50:00
Listen to the man, Reddit, he's a Doctor. He knows what he's talking about.
@_date: 2014-06-20 02:07:21
Thank you.
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:40:20
Jason! I look forward to meeting you as well, and thanks for letting us present on the project. Bitcoin Beltway is going to be *awesome*.
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:49:57
I don't think we have the answer to this honestly. Our goal is to build it first. Once it's being used we hope there is incentive for people to contribute their time or money to keep it going.
We think some merchants will prefer this platform over existing options, no fees and no censorship, so they will have an interest in maintenance. Similar to how BitPay has Garzik, companies might support development.
OpenBazaar is not our full time jobs. We all have families and this is something that is taking most of our spare time. We need other developers to step in contribute.
@_date: 2014-08-08 04:12:43
Isn't that a beautiful dream? We want to make it happen.
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:15:55
That's up to the users. We are creating the platform that others will use to manage their own online trade. Our vision is a future where people engage in trade online directly with each other, instead of relying on centralized services.
So to answer your question: just anything!
@_date: 2014-08-08 01:39:47
Even just taking a quick look at the code and opening issues or asking questions help us....[hint hint](
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:38:51
Hey thanks a lot! We'll try to check in here when we hit major milestones to keep folks up to date.
@_date: 2014-06-20 00:09:18
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-06-20 02:54:26
Haha, will do...although, the way OpenBazaar will work, *you'll* be the one connecting New Zealand!
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:21:23
* First answer in other comment below (you ninja edited!) 
* We're working on a way to do product categories.
* If sellers put their location in the contract, then yes, but we can't (and wouldn't want to) force people to list their location.
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:46:26
Yeah since we're not quite ready for testing, we haven't bothered explaining this yet. But you're correct, you will download an installer and connect to a network, similar to BitTorrent except instead of sharing big media files you're sharing contracts with product details.
Our goal is to make it as easy as possible. We need the beta testers to help us understand how to make it better!
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:20:41
@_date: 2014-06-20 00:09:01
Fortunately for you that already exists! Go develop it :).
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:55:20
Fees will also be determined by the market. Our expectation is that for normal trades they will be free, no fees at all. Only when there is a dispute will they get paid. This is because the cost of running a node to notarize and create a multisig transaction is very low (it can be automated if the notary agrees).
We really don't know what it will end up looking like. Early on we'll bootstrap it and the core team will probably to a lot of the nodes, but who knows? 
We do know there are no fees to list a product, and your money is your own, so we're already ahead of Ebay in that regard.
@_date: 2014-06-20 02:58:39
Those are great ideas, thanks Vitalik. If you get a chance, we'd love to have your thoughts on the project overall and where you see challenges and opportunities. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:01:23
As Brian has said, it's like the child of Ebay and Bittorrent. It's not a centralized platform like Ebay, but you can buy and sell items the same way. 
The best of Ebay without PayPal and censorship.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:34:08
That's a great question, since I'm in that boat myself!
Spreading the word is really important. It allows us to reach developers who can help build, and it also helps reach future users, so that when we launch they'll already be aware and willing to check it out.
If you aren't a developer but have some tech savvy, you can help test and submit bug requests.
If you've got a big ole' brain like Dr. Sanchez, you can put out theoretical work that helps guide the coding.
And you can donate money. We aren't pushing hard for donations at this point, but once we get more developers on board and interest grows we will need more funding. If you've got experience with crowdfunding that would be appreciated as well.
Edit: Are and aren't are different words.
Also, just hang out in the IRC and tell us we're awesome, we like that a lot.
@_date: 2014-06-19 17:43:13
OpenBazaar project member here; we're doing an AMA in about fifteen minutes in this subreddit!
@_date: 2014-08-08 04:25:14
The DHTs don't hold the full contracts, they hold keyword listings which point people to the original node that has the full contract. So when you search you are only looking for keywords, and go from there, it's a lot more easy on the network.
Who knows about oracles? We want to avoid centralization as much as possible, but if the system gets big enough I really don't know what approach we'll take (our lead dev Brian might have better answers). It would be a great problem to have!!
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:18:38
Hey thanks!
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:26:13
We've been approached to issue some type of BazaarCoin or something, and we emphatically refused. We prefer to build something that people find valuable first, and then ask the community for donations in order to scale. If beta goes well, then we'll probably do a proper crowdfunding campaign to really bring it to a wider audience, but we're taking it one step at a time.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:23:38
As of now, we don't really need to integrate any particular wallet, OpenBazaar is more for distributing and searching the product listings, signing contracts, using arbiters, managing the trade itself. The bitcoin can be sent or received in any wallet, it just has to be visible in the blockchain.
But certainly Dark Wallet offers options that might appeal to OpenBazaar users.
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:20:31
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-06-20 00:08:36
It's open source so if they want to drop the code in and make it fit, I hope they do it.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:38:26
Bingo. It's not testable for the average user yet. But we hope it will be in a few months.
@_date: 2014-06-19 17:48:56
Nope, new thread.
@_date: 2014-08-08 04:21:42
There are a few out there already, we'll probably point people to them. I wrote a few myself actually!
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:23:53
I've been pushing this myself, I think Tails compatibility would be a huge benefit. 
As of now, that's not a specific goal, but it is something we'd like to happen. If we get more developers then it's more likely!
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:56:30
Nope, just lazy. It's ok, you're among friends on Reddit.
@_date: 2014-06-20 01:40:37
Fixed, thank you!
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:29:29
Ha! That went over my head. Brian answered better than I could.
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:17:08
If this is true, I can guarantee you that I would no longer support this effort. I have not heard this and do not hear it discussed internally, but then again the miners participate not at all for the most part in the Slack or mailing list.
