Did you really get on another account just to argue with me? Lame. At least change your ip. Ugh. Amateurs.

Second attempt at information operation by the Ruskies. What's the new Tier 1 term: active measures? 
Propaganda. Russia wants the exact opposite of what Bitcoin is.

No, I mean you copy/pasted an article of relevance. Where did you source this? 
Don't bother. You are just using a Boolean search off google and copy-posting whatever seems intellectual to this conversation. Parroting articles off the internet is not a new concept either.

Did you come up with this in your own? Looks familiar.

Confirmation bias is what you are describing but a broken face clock gets the time right at least once a day.
Sometimes twice. ;) Always consider the source when determining information is credible. The source is the only thing that matters. Trust but verify.

What YOU have is confirmation bias.
Your tangent about Hitler is irrelevant but it's cool. Not here to argue or point out your flawed logic. I sure hope you are using your intelligence for good.

Coinbase handles everything else?

It is. It's run-of-the-mill information warfare. A lil' psyops for the gullible.

I just said "screw it" and cashed out through BitPay.
