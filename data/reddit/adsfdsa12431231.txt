Assuming there are wiretaps on major internet exchange points it would be very easy to monitor bitcoin transactions.. they are sent cleartext to (by default) 8 nodes directly from the origin IP. Some of those 8 nodes will be reached through one of the main internet chokepoints, passing through the wiretap.. I guess you can pretend that this isn't a problem if you want, but really it wouldn't take that much resources to build a system to monitor almost all bitcoin transactions - it's well within the capabilities of our intelligence agencies.

You do know because you're listening to the initial broadcast. How do you know it's the initial broadcast? because you're listening to everything and it's the first time you hear it. 
Sure it won't work 100% of the time, but the initial broadcast is sent to 8 nodes so there's a good chance one of those initial packets will go through a wiretap and it will be from the origin with the origin IP and you know it's the origin IP because it's the first time your wiretaps picked it up. change address association will fill in the blanks on any transactions you do miss.. but really you might only need to tap one or two (key) cables in the world to do this.. and realistically they are already wiretapped for other purposes anyway so it would just be a new software upgrade.
edit; consider this.. if you're connected to any nodes in china they are going through deep packet inspection by the great firewall of china.. the firewall of china just needs to be configured to sive off first seen bitcoin transactions.. also chinese networks are only connected to the US by one or two paths so the NSA probably wiretaps them on the US side too.. basically it's really not that difficult for state intelligence agencies to engineer a situation where they are always wiretapping the original tx broadcast - especially when they have 8 chances to do it.
