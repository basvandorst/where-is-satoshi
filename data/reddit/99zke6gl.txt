Sent to personal Gmail account. I know for a fact they don't micromanage their inbox following the "inbox zero" philosophy.

I also made the mistake of telling my coworkers I mined crypto. 
After a few months I ended up having to lie and said I liquidated the farm and sold everything at a loss. 
The crypto discussions have stopped and I'm still quietly accumulating without attracting any attention.
Being a crypto evangelist can be quite annoying when nobody is receptive. When we ordered pizza I always listed bitcoin as a bill splitting payment option but everyone just preferred paypal or venmo. 
I can't force it down their throats either. 
One day they'll have their aha moment.

The password to the phone. Not the seed.
If I give a paper they will lose it. 
Email; they can search the email history and retrieve it.

I can give them in person yes. But I'm worried they'll misplace that paper. 
Different security box at a different location with just the password is a good alternative.

Yes this part is what worries me. 
I'm planning on visiting those boxes once a year and making sure the phones are working. 
Might add a third phone at a third location for triple replication. 
I think I'm more scared of putting my readable seed on a paper in my safety box then dealing with the phones thing. Just one error on the part of the bank and if that box is opened by anyone else the money is gone. 
Whereas with this phone system it adds some protection buffer. 
Yes 10 password attempts per phone. 
Okay I'll think about this step. 
How would you transmit the phone password and make sure it's available 10 years from now?

The phones would contain instructions on how to restore onto a ledger. They're just used as a cryptosteel replacement to keep prying eyes off the seed words. 
The bip39 passphrase is a good alternative to that  though. 
But that still leaves the question of how to transmit the phone password / bip39 passphrase to the family in a way that is easily findable in 10 years.

I thank you for this very informative post. 
I'll definitely revise my strategy based on your experience!

Ok your highness. What does your majesty consider a normal email service.
@_date: 2019-04-21 13:58:48
I decided to use a phone because it's a locked down ecosystem. 
If I put that on a USB stick, I don't know where they'll plug that in to access the file. 
So a phone display is the best way I came up with to show them the seed without exposing it to potential threats. 
And yes, the instructions will mention how to restore that on a ledger device. 
I'll think about the password through email step. Tnx.

Yes. Gmail. Whether it's Gmail or protonmail or whatever other email provider it's the same thing. 
What will Google do with the password? It serves no purpose without having physical access to the phone devices. 
I'm open to suggestions on alternatives to transmit the password. 
So far people in this thread have been mocking my email option but nobody proposed a better alternative that's easily retrievable 10 years from now.

Does your grandma run her own email server to receive her bingo invitations?
Yes normal people use Gmail.
