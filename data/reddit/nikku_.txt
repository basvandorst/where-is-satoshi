Sorry to reply to such an old post. The reason we can't do this directly is the same reason we can't send money straight to BitStamp - it has to be in Euros so we would still have convert it first using TransferWise making this no easier or harder than using BitStamp.

See [this comment]( for an actual explanation of what he has done here.

Seems like they are taking a while to process deposits though. I sent a SEPA transfer 3 working days ago and it still hasn't appeared in my account.

It was actually rather sunny where I am on the south coast.

Might be worth asking in And as nightwolfz says, 5GH/s might not be worth it by the time you get it.
Personally, I would recommend looking into litecoin mining with a GPU based rig. @_date: 2013-04-11 18:37:20
Because there are local BofA branches all over the UK...

I disagree. It may be a couple of years before he makes his money back but if he buys a bit more at the low, he should be fine.

Aaaaand, I missed it. I have got to be faster when things like this happen.

As long as you have them stored and backed up securely. Please don't just leave them in an exchange.

I got the email from TW on the 10th saying it should be with BitStamp on the 11th by 9am. I'm still waiting.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:23:29
Buy somewhere else perhaps?
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:46:16
Just keep holding. You should be able to make your money back (or most of it) in a while. Might be a year or two though.

You can learn a lot with a quick peak at the html. He is using [StyleShop](

This is exactly the problem at the moment. 
We have Mt. Gox which handles the vast majority and does a reasonably good job of it with quite powerful servers that can handle spike traffic with some lag but without falling over completely. Then we have all the much smaller exchanges which are fine (and often better than Gox) most of the time because they are small and don't have enough users to cause problems so they don't really need or have powerful servers. However, when a spike happens they often just completely fall over as Bitstamp has been doing off and on for the last few minutes.

I've heard it should still work fine as it does that for everyone. 
I've currently been waiting a bit more than a day since TW sent my money for it to arrive at BitStamp.

AFAIK, it got hacked a while ago and then actually returned everyone's money when they quite easily could have said it was all 'lost'.

Seems alive at the moment.

They kept giving estimates that they never met. Nobody knows if they even have any prototypes.
Avalon ASICs are the only ones out in the wild at the moment AFAIK.
