He was still in the "bottom" when he called it though.

Is it ridiculous? If Anon's prediction of price at specific dates was proven correct 3 times in a row, then is it unreasonable to think they might know what they are talking about? 
2 for 2 is already impressive but in my mind its within the margin of possibility for luck. 3 for 3 and feeling bullish. 4 for 4 and im mortgaging my house lol.

I dont see a massive dump below 10k. There is to much long term money in bitcoin for it to collapse just off price action. The market is pretty comfortable with a 10k valuation. anything under that is seen as a bargain and people start buying in bulk. each 1k you go down in price, more and more people will load up the boat. 
I'm skeptical of any price above 20k, but I think 9-10k is the new floor.

What's your time table? If you need the money today then get out, but if you can wait a week I would wait a few days. That was just a small correction on the way to the top.

I do. The market is very Bullish on BTC right now.

You exchange it for fiat.
