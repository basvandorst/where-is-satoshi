so... Social Democrat... isn't left... it's actually a moderate right (leaning center) in my country... which actually makes sense since we, SD's, tend to be exactly like this... privatize what needs to be privatized, keep it publicly owned when it's a strategic sector, ie, healthcare (country is healthy, the market is healthy sort of mentality)
but you know, your country is so fucked up that every option you have is extreme right-wing compared to most republics/democracies, so I end up sounding like what you consider a neoliberal... which would be a conservative left wing in your country (ironic, I know, since I'm overall right-wing in my country's political scene)
You don't really seem to understand the issue of the Venezuelan economy...
they subsist pretty much on oil... oil dropping in price means they can't import most... anything... at all, this means products are rare, prices are super high...
add to this extreme inflation, and obviously people can't afford shit unless the government issues new type of currency and forces an overall raise, as per the raise of minimum government-backed wage (as is customary in socialist countries, the private sector tends to follow these)
so their case right now is that what you got with 1000 bolivars yesterday, is 10000 bolivars today (just an example, don't have an exact example of this, but let's just consider the fact that coca-cola decided to stop producing locally due to the price being far too high due to importation costs of ingredients, and no one actually consuming coca-cola when it's almost as expensive as any basic necessary bit of food)
In addition to this...
I have far too many friends with family over there, they tell me news of their family every weekend when we tend to meet up...
your next step would be "they could just leave"
people aren't being allowed to leave the country...
so yeah, I'm not trying to be righteous here, I'm trying to point out the fact that a country became so corrupt and dependent on one single resource, that when that resource's value dropped, they basically went bankrupt (tbh, bankrupcy would've been easier on the population in the long run) due to corruption and an idiot being in charge

you mean "socialist broken economy rationing" *points to Venezuela* it's literally happening there, baby formula costs double of what some people earn in a month

so, I know you seem to think you're all righteous and all...
but here's an issue you don't seem to understand...
people are starving over there, they can't buy food, they can't feed their babies, if you don't consume food, you can't really produce milk
put that into your head right now and attempt to realize why they need baby formula in that country
it's so their babies don't [die out of starvation](
this idiot is a Social Democrat (I'm not American, not in the US), I'm in favour of a decent measure of social projects, backed by a strong market (universal healthcare being one of them)

Not an American, can't really vote for you, but I would if I could.
Now just a small thing about your website...
What in god's name happened to that nice soft edge done to the left and right borders of the image? I can't seem to see those in the bottom edge and it's making my eyes hurt in quite the painful way.
Anyway, thumbs up and good luck, the US needs more people like you!

sorry to say this man... had sweet Czech Pints for 70 euro cents...
friend of mine tells me good German beer goes for 80 cents a pint too, in some areas...
and here I am, spending my time in the UK where a shitty pint can be 4 pounds...

actually... Greece wasn't fucked for joining the EU... Greece was fucked by their own idiotic governments and big American/German/French banks who had their hand in hiding Greek public debt via a crap load of loopholes...
the comedic part of this is that the banks that caused this were pretty much bailed out and didn't even go to court for illegalities

Site feels rather nice asides for that :)

you don't seem to realize that half of the community here probably lurks on r/wallstreetbets

If I recall correctly the same problem is present in the J2ME framework, has been for quite a long time...

it's an Import tax, basically it's a way to force outside companies to move into Brazil and produce locally, thus removing the cost of sale there and creating jobs.
a PS3 last time I checked would still cost a whole 1k over there...
