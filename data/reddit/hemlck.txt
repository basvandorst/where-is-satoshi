Then you don't understand one bit the point of cryptocurrency lol.
This would completely defeat the purpose as it would mean you need someone to control the coins.
Smart Contracts do fix this problem but smart contracts arn't really implemented in Bitcoin.

I agree but you should also understand that there were lots of major players in the game who found Bitcoin to be more profitable for them if it stayed the way it was.
Thee was a lot of money involved so with it comes corruption.
This is why Socrates hated Democracy as well. You get the people who don’t really understand the full in and outs of the tech and have them vote to choose what happens. If the economy was done this way, the economy would collapse lol.

Oh no I completely agree with you that crypto doesnt solve as many problems as many of these subreddits say. Maybe i misinterpreted your post because everything you are saying now I completely agree with.
Crypto just allows for trust to be needed between the two people themselves. You would not need to put trust into banks or a third party to make sure that the transaction is done right. I hate how people describe blockchain as a trustless system. While it is somewhat true, i think people take it the wrong way.

Can you explain this? What do you mean by a lower real wage?


But would it be true that almost the entire world, excluding Cuba and North Korea, runs on the Keynesian Model. You can argue Austrian all you want but 


Havn't read it but **Controlled Inflation** stimulates the economy by encouraging people to spend rather than to save their money. Having a linear 2% Inflation (or atleast thats what they aim for) means that even if you were to save your money, overtime, you would be losing a portion of the worth of the dollars. This combats hoarding, like we see in Bitcoin today.


There certainly are problems with it but it is much, much healthier for the economy as opposed to using Austrian School of Economics.


This is why I support cryptocurrency and the blockchain. However, I think you are oversimplifying the issue. I think you are assuming that the Federal Reserve itself is malicious. They are what help to drive the economy. They help to make important decisions that help to regulate the economy. I do agree that we need to do something different which is where I see blockchain having an impact. But I would say its naive to want a global currency that is based on Austrian School of Economics. Well, we've already seen the run with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They are deflationary. They do not make a good choice for currency and would directly impact the economy.


Again, I do not understand how this would cause people to work for a lower real wage. If you look at the [data]( it suggests otherwise. After we got rid of the Gold Standard, the real wage actually grew to higher than it ever had before. And the Gold Standard is already regarded by most economics as having been a failure. Why do you think every country (again, aside from North Korea and Cuba) has switched to Fiat Currency.


I will say that you make a good point with this one. I do agree with you on that. But I also think going the way with the Austrian School of Economics is a step in the wrong direction. I stated this above but again, I think blockchain can directly help our economy while still following the Keynesian school of economics. What we need is more stability in the people who control the money. Poor choices (which to be fair, running an economy is extremely hard and small choices can have major impacts) can lead to economic collapses like you said. Something inherently transparent, like the blockchain, I feel, can be used to make this system much better.


Yes, you are right that Bitcoin was built on this idea and it was purposelessly made to deflate. I am arguing that if we want a cyrptocurrency to be used in modern day society, we can build off of the blockchain and help redesign it, following more closely with Keynesian Economics (and like you said, whether you agree or disagree it is good/bad.)


I honestly love Bitcoin and have supported it for a long time but I don't really think that Bitcoin is going to be what stands on top in the end. I have more respect for Bitcoin than any other coin because its idea is what started a revolution and is what introduced the Blockchain. I also do not agree with the way Bitcoin chose to go and the "censorship" problems (hope I don't get banned lol) that goes on in the Bitcoin community. When the Bitcoin Cash fork happened, I was really hoping Bitcoin Cash would become the norm. Instead, Bitcoin remained and stayed the same. I mean, Bitcoin's community is pretty much just investors too who will defend anything. Remember those times when they were defending $45 fees for transactions. Yup lol. Thats why I hopped off the whole Bitcoin ride. I currently find ethereum to be superior as well and I do not understand why people are still on Bitcoin.

No its not.
We are talking about Global Debt. Not consumer debt.
At the same time as the Global Debt is rising, the Global GDP is rising with it. This is most certainly a good factor.

Its the view the post has on economics (which to be fair, economics is not taught well or at all to the general population).
Here are the main points that I think need to be addressed.


This thought process is actually kinda common but the poster treats it as if it is fact and makes the assumption that fiat currency has no value. While it is true that gold and silver standards were part of our currency for a long time, saying that because we are without it, our money is worthless is naive. The fact that there is trust in the USD and that it is a resource that is in high demand by the public makes it have value. A lot of people put this down to the Keynesian vs. Austrian school of economics but the Keynesian school of economics is what almost every country follows (excluding Cuba and North Korea) and is how money is based off of. The Federal Reserve is what basically runs the show and is what has the most direct control over the economy.


I personally have not read too much on how this coin works and do not know if the amount of coins is tied to the USD or if its independent of the USD so I cannot speak on that part. However, I can certainly speak on the second part.
First of all, what is more likely to happen? That McDonald's as a business closes down or that the US has an economic collapse (which also, the US is very important to the global economy as shown by the USD backing almost all currencies so we could potentially say a global economic collapse). If the USD was to fall, almost all currencies would fall with it given that the federal reserve backs almost all global currencies with USD (which some countries have not been fond of and have been trying to move away from). Also, this really isn't a currency with high demand. This is only used for Big Macs. It is literally backed by Big Macs (and again, I am not sure how true this statement is as I have yet to look closely into the coin). There is very little trust in this currency as opposed to the USD which literally runs the global economy. The USD is also pretty stable as far as stability goes due to controlled inflation. This coin still is going to be tied back indirectly to fiat currencies.
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:05:34
You do know that the federal reserve aims for 2% inflation each year.
It encourages spending and consumerism which is a good thing. Even one of south park’s episodes touched on how spending is important for growing the economy.
[South Park's Margaritiville Analaysis](
@_date: 2018-07-30 23:40:53


Somewhat. I am still hesitant as to what I think of the USD and I do believe it can be done better and that there are a few things that need to be addressed, however, it is literally the center of global economics. If it is to fall, so is the global economy.


Its created and follows controlled inflation which really isn't that scary and makes sense. Its created out of nothing which a lot of people assume means that the federal reserve just creates it whenever they want. Its a lot more complicated than that.


Eh, not necessarily. Economics is a lot more complex than that. There is a lot of factors that play into hyperinflation.


Yes, which is exactly what the Keynesian school of economics points out to be wrong and an economic thought fallacy. We discovered awhile ago that it would be a much smarter idea to take silver/gold out of our currencies. It allows fiat currency to be manipulated accordingly, allowing us to more easily create controlled inflation. It is backed by trust and demand which are a lot stronger and more important than you think.


That its open source and is finite (for atleast some cryptos) means that it doesn't need to be backed for it to have value. Its a resource like silver and gold (which silver and gold are not backed by anything except for themselves).
@_date: 2018-07-12 22:25:19


I don't know how I could even argue against this part since its my opinion based so I'll just skip that for now.


Yeah, you are right that I shouldn't have used the word "obvious". A lot of these response were just getting on my nerves when it was clear that the people had done little to no research and wouldn't even listen to my side of the argument.


Hmm, so a globally used economic system that is based off of central banking directly with top economists leading it are wrong in that it benefits the economy. I think you are more concerned about its effect on you and your wealth as opposed to society as a whole. No doubt it feels good to be in a bullish position on an asset that you have research extensively and believe it will rise very soon. I respect that too as I have my own positions I am in. However, as a payment system, it discourages spending and consumerism, directly affecting the economy.


I know and it took me a long time to understand and fully grasp why but it works. How it works? I dont fucking know. I sat through countless classes and even with trying to fully grasp how this system works, it becomes so bizarre. Then, fucking politicans act like the debt is bad and always say stuff about reducing the debt while they actually know its just another thing to focus people's attention to.
I think you would agree with the statement that "Gold is money, and fiat currency is credit/debt". The reason why the money has value is because of the debt itself and that it is needed to try and pay off debts. Its such an odd system that shouldn't work but it does. I cannot even understand the thought that went through creating this system and how the majority of people don't even fully understand it and if they tried, they would realize how scary the system seems.


As much as I support economic decentralization, I quickly came to realize that the majority of people do not want this. I have a huge interest in cybersecurity so I am willing to spend extra time securing and understanding how to keep my money/data safe. The average person wants there to be an "undo" button for when someone ends up breaking into their account because they were careless. Do you know how many people would hate and immediately go against the idea of a currency that could not have transactions reverted. If you messed up one piece of the transaction, you can lose all that money.
People don't want to be their own bank. They may say "fuck the banks" and all that on the side but when they receive a call saying their account was hacked and has been overdrawn, they realize they can simply reverse it by saying someone broke into their account. In the perfect world a decentralized currency would be huge but we have become so accustomed to central banks playing the role of our money guardian that I do not think the average people would even want to take control of their money.


If you think deflation is always a good thing and that bitcoin would work as a currency in its current state, I could say the same about you. Look how easily people followed the bandwagon to invest in Bitcoin. Its become an investment to most people, not a currency. I'd say its been like this ever since around 2014 to be honest. Before that, bitcoin had a passionate community. Now, its filled with people who don't understand what a bubble is and just think its a get rich scheme.
Controlled Inflation can most certainly be beneficial and I do not see how you can even argue with that. You are completely missing the point of Fiat Currency which is to be stable. It is much easier to control a steady state of inflation than to try and control deflation. Bitcoin had an amazing idea but as a payment system, its not there. Again, the average person does not want to see their money lose 20% of its value in a day.
2% inflation guarantees that 
a.) it is more effective to spend it than to save it (and it actually costs more to save the money then to spend it). Saving money is BAD for the economy overall as it greatly reduces the flow of money and purchase of goods. An economy does best when people feel they are doing well which is why it is good to incentive people to spend money. If you have common sense, you would still put away money for your Emergency Fund, Health Insurance, etc.
b.) The **money stays stable which is an entire point you seem to be missing in this thread**. In the real world, no person wants an asset that constantly is changing. You remember that 2010 silver jump where silver went from $8 to $48 in only two years. Then, do you remember it tanking to around $10 only a few years later and hitting $14 (and yes, I bought that dip lol).
And most of all, you forget that steady inflation shows control over the economy which in turns means it is being handled well as well as growing. I just do not understand how people can think that saving is healthy for the economy and then think that these huge fluctuations and bullish runs make the economy strong when a few weeks after the resource loses 70% of its value and everything collapses.
@_date: 2018-07-12 23:14:32
Okay I will think over these some more but I also wanted to make sure you knew that I totally agree with


However, its only the economic part I have the problem with. I mean, consumerism is kind bad in itself depending on your views on it but I am still unsure if less spending and consumption would actually benefit the economy because it reminds me a lot of the 2008 financial crisis and how so people tried their hardest to buy as little as they could.


Hmm... im not exactly sure how it could but if you can explain it ill be happy to see how it could.


Not sure exactly what you mean by spreadsheet (Im assuming you dont mean a ledger either) but I think most of the importance of money comes from trust in its own worth and trust that others believe it has worth (and obviously trust in that its a resource that everyone seems to want and so because there is trust others will buy it, it has value).


Ah it sure is. As a kid growing up, I started off by collecting silver and this was back in 2011-2012 I think so right when silver was beginning to tank again. I remember platinum used to be worth more than gold. After awhile out of investing I come back to hear things have completely flipped around with platinum being less than gold and silver having hit like $15. Its crazy. I think in 2013 i began to buy bitcoin for ordering on the darknet.
I distinctively remember seeing it hit $1000 after I think Obama had said something about bitcoins and it got a lot of people interested and then you know the story. The Mt. Gox hack became public and everything tanked. It took me until I turned 16 to actually understand why cryptocurrency is so important.
@_date: 2018-07-30 18:45:05


It is not interestingly deflationary. It follows the same rule that most deflationary currencies follow. There is a finite amount of it.


You can label anything with value some sort of a currency if you really wanted to. You don't really see gift cards having an impact on the economy either. They are value in relation to the fiat currency it is representing so it is directly tied to that currency.
Example: Gift cards (x) are only equal to the fiat currency they represent. They are not standalone currencies and do not fluctuate in value. When you buy a $50 xbox live gift card, it remains worth $50. It does not change.


If you haven't taken a modern economics course, you probably would believe that deflation is good because uncontrolled inflation is bad. This is wrong. For a better explanation, you should probably take some economics courses but for simplisticty, 
**Controlled inflation allows fiat currency to remain balanced and more stable than a currency that is uncontrolled. Do you know how hard it would be for most people to do finances if the value of USD changed drastically every day. Not only is that a problem, but controlled inflation encourages economic growth through encouraging spending. You can say all you want about bitcoin but as a single currency, it would be very bad for the economy. People would realize that over time it will just gain value and people will begin to hoard bitcoin (as we already see today). Thus, people stop spending and the economy begins to collapse. I mean, you can't even argue with this because its currently seen today. Most people that own bitcoin own it as an investment and most people never spend it.**

In no way am I dodging the question. I am trying to make you understand that government debt is different from personal debt but you seem to keep glossing over that fact.
If you want to actually learn about government debt, a post from six days ago does a wonderful job at highlighting how common it is for people to think they understand economics but actually don't.


[OP's Question](
[Answer to OP's Question - Part 1](
[Answer to OP's Question - Part 2](
You seem to again be confused with what debt is. I find it crazy that the majority of our population still believes the debt problem is real. Politicians use this to their advantage when making economic policies and can make economic policies that look good to the public but are horrible for the economy.
Again, before you go on about debt, please, look into government debt first. You are confusing it with personal debt. Economics is a lot more complicated than you may think.
@_date: 2018-07-31 03:33:40
Because thats not how debt works.
The US Debt is not the same debt you have when you get a loan. The US Debt is why the USD has value.

Debt helps to give money value.

@_date: 2018-07-30 22:38:49
I hope my post didn't come off that way but I was just trying to show how the post above relies heavily on people not having a good understanding of economics (which isn't really their fault either as economics isn't really taught to the general population, hence, why so many people still believe the US Debt problem is a problem and things like that).
Thats also why so many politicians lie about their economic policies. To the public, *x* may sound like a huge favor for the economy but economics is a hard/complex subject. If more people understood how economics worked, people would be more scared and have less trust in the economy. It truly is an interesting subject and is more complicated than most people think.
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:52:49
It is a controversial issue and if most people fully understood how the economy worked, it honestly would be broken. It runs on a system that seems so incredibly flawed and sounds like it cannot work at all but... it works.
No doubt we have had financial crisises, especially back in 2008, but those are also to be expected of human nature and our current economic system.
There are a few fatal flaws with cryptocurrency which keep the blockchain from controlling a large part of our life.
1.) Most people don't want Decentralization. Maybe you and I but not the person who wants to spend hours making sure their bank account / private keys are secure. The average person likes that a bank can reverse charges.
2.) Most cryptocurrencies tend to be deflationary which means people are more likely to hoard them and less likely to spend them and now we are back at square 1 with the problem of low consumerism leading to the economy collapsing.
I know these directly contradict the whole cryptocurrency movement and trust me, I am for the blockchain more than the next person but people are assuming its going to replace our entire economic system. Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Technology has its own time and place.
@_date: 2018-07-30 18:29:45
Yup, this right here.
Deflation sounds good to the person who holds the money but deflation also slows down economic growth. Although i still think cryptocurrency is huge and the blockchain has many uses, economics is a complicated field. Theres a reason why most countries try and encourage limited/controlled inflation of their currency.
@_date: 2018-07-12 21:15:11


How is that ignorant? That is literally what the Federal Reserve themselves state lol.


Spending and consumption obviously is a major part of what powers the economy and causes the economy to grow. You should be less concerned about why they are aiming for 2% inflation and why inflation is important and be more concerned with the fact that they directly can manipulate the entire market and whoops! Looks like it may have caused the 2008 global financial collapse.
Thats what Bitcoin was originally meant to help separate the economy from.
@_date: 2018-07-12 20:22:54
First, I really appreciate this response as opposed to other responses through this thread as you seem to actually been asking questions and wanting to understand how this system works. I tried to be as detailed as I could but I havn't slept in three days so my minds kinda mush rn but this is the basis of our odd... really odd system.


Yes but thats for consumer debt as you stated. Most people here don't seem to realize that there is more than just consumer debt and think that the government is under a debt similar to consumer debt in which it needs to be paid. They are completely different. The federal reserve can create money with no backing of the funds for the bills that need to be paid by the government. Banks also do this same exact thing where they create money (through credit) out of thin air and charge you for it. Banks don't even use other customer's money to pay off this. They just make it out of nowhere through fractional reserves.


Yup, thats the closest answer I have seen through this whole thread. Basically, debt is a resource like silver / gold / bitcoin. **To add to this, many countries heavily depend on the USD to back its own reserves**. Its def a hard concept to grasp because from a far, it makes absolutely no sense and it seems like it just should not work.
**Here is a basic layout:**
1.) The government receives taxes and pays off what it can. There is always accumulating debt so then they speak with the Treasury Department and give the treasury a bond.
2.) Treasury, by use of banks, gives this bond to the federal reserve to be payed.
3.) The Federal Reserve has no balance but still out of thin air creates money (**or debt**) to pay the bill for the government.
That debt is now... money. It came from nowhere and doesn't exist but its there and its as real as money is.
**Debt == Money**
Also, I would like to say how disappointed I am with this subreddit not taking the time to actually learn about economics and instead, trying to argue what just gets pushed around here. I myself am still a supporter of cryptocurrency but 90% of the people here have no clue what they are talking about and just regurgitate concepts about "how money is fake and has no value" all while they just tried to argue with me that debt, or money, is a bad thing.
Money brings out the worst in people with arguments and people get really defensive so I am not too surprised I got downvoted a lot for what I said. I expected more out of a cryptocurrency subreddit and instead, all I found was people that are "fighting the system" without actually understanding what the system it is.
I expected more of a cryptocurrency subreddit.
Going to add a bit more clarificaiton so I can just link people back this post instead.
So lets say we had countries that wanted to pay back the debt. Well, let me tell you, no country is going to actually do that. When you start paying back that debt, you are lowering the supply of currency your country has which is detrimental to the system and your country.
Now lets surprise some more of you even more. Do you know the Federal Reserve is most likely the most powerful entity there is. They can manipulate the market according to their needs and wants. Thats why the original people involved in cryptocurrency in 2008, following after the federal reserve along with other factors caused the 2008 financial crisis, began to look at Bitcoin to separate from the central banks.
From having read all your responses, it is clear that most of you do not give a shit about how the actual economic system works and are trying to fight the central banks without even knowing why.
# I have no problem with people investing in cryptocurrency but if you want to invest... invest. Don't come in here acting like you are doing this for the good of the economy while in reality, you saw the price skyrocket and became a "bitcoin expert and investor". I understand some people here are actually here for the technology and understand the significance of Bitcoin but the majority of this subreddit has just become a circlejerk on Fiat Currency and Central Banks when you don't even understand how it works.
**Sorry for rant but damn**. The community used to be so amazing and then greed (from large companies and banks) got involved and turned Bitcoin into an unregulated investment. Blockchain has so much potential and with these large drops, hopefully this will be the end of the "Invest In Bitcoin!!!" era and will instead be an improvement upon the economy.

Most certainly not. Debt is the same thing as money. What do you think your dollar bills represent? Trust and Debt.
**More Debt = More Money in the Economy**
If countries do not fall into more debt, they will not grow.
I used to believe in the Austrian school of economics until I took economic courses and realized how it actually seems to work.
I do respect people that find the Austrian school of economics to be superior as for some cases, it is. However, if you are trying to improve an economy, you need to stimulate spending and consumerism.
Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies face the same problem that the money system faces in Austrian school and is a perfect example of why as a global economic system, it would not be a good idea to have something that will deflate in value over time. And thats definetly not to say that cryptocurrency and blockchain should not be used in the economy because i support them as much as the next person in these subreddits but I also understand how it functions.
I think only about 1 / 5 people (and im being generous here) i meet who are involved with cryptocurrencies do it for actual payments. The rest have treated cryptocurrencies as an investment and many people don't ever end up spending any because its a finite resource, meaning its naturally deflationary.
Imagine having the US Dollar gain value over time instead of losing value. A lot of the value would come from speculation and fiat currency is not supposed to be so hugely varying in price. Fiat currency is meant to be stable and to be at a steady growth of inflation (obviously some economic diasters can skewer this steady inflation).
It makes absolutely no sense to have an economic system that encourages saving as consumerism is a major part of what drives economic growth.


Our entire world functions on debt and we are a debt-based economy (although there are a few exceptions). Should we list them:
- North Korea
- Cuba
- Iran
The entire world is using debt-based economics. Its naive to say its a bad thing as entire teams of economists have found this system to be the most effective and to have caused the greatest amount of growth in gloabal economists.
So basically, this article at the top is saying the global debt is going up (while also the GDP is going up) so we are doing pretty good.
**That it got 1.1k upvotes and people are taking it to be a bad thing explains how most people here don't understand economics.**

Oh no, looks like we’ve run into another victim of the US Debt Problem. Don’t worry, i believed it was real for the majority of my life as well.
Look into what US Debt is and why its not necessarily a bad thing.
For a short explanation, government debt is not the same as personal debt which I think you are getting confused with. If you truly want the US Debt to go down... then you just found one of the ways to completely break and crash the economy.

You clearly don't understand economics then.
I used to support austrian school over keynesian as well because it seems like it makes sense. Well, it doesn't actually. Although I still hate to say so, keynesian school of economics is much more useful in the society we live in.

Yes this exactly. Obviously, if a person owes debt like student loans or on their house, its a different problem. On the other hand, all that talk about America being so high in debt is just to get people to be mad at something and to "vote" for this politician who wants to change that.
@_date: 2018-07-12 13:50:34
No it doesn’t.
People need to understand our economy works on debt and debt is not a bad thing.
**Edit: How is this post even controversial??? Its the basis of world economics.**

I was actually thinking of something very similar.  I feel like the blockchain has so much potential to work as a transparent way of voting.

Seriously, I love cryptocurrency and how it has potential to change our economic system but posts like this show off how so many people who support Bitcoin and cryptocurrency don’t understand basic economics.
This only recently began too with all the “get rich quick” investors looking at crypto. Back in 2013, the community actually understood the purpose and why crypto is so important. That this post got more upvotes than downvotes shows just how oblivious most people who are involved in crypto are.

Yes, this.  My account was restricted and I could still send out my bitcoins and ethereum.  However, I could not buy or sell
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:58:10
Wait, can you explain why on August 1st it would cost less?  I know thats when the hard-fork is but wont the price go up instead?
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:38:06
Yes he can.  The fork isnt just going to affect coinbase.
I doubt BCH will last long anyways before going to $0 but lots of sites are stopping the buying and selling of bitcoins tommorow.
It also effects him if he is using a website or application that does not show him his private key (like coinbase).

Fees are extremely high however
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:39:49
Amazing explanation.  Thank you.  Seems like there are so auto-downvoters going around on this sub though

On the topic of the stealing of bitcoins, how exactly can a transaction be stopped in the example of the box and the note.
I get that the long-time would give a lot of time to catch whether some person is putting it to their wallet but how does someone determine this?  Is it possible it can just be entirely ignored for the whole time.  How are the addresses differentiated.
Also, my apologies if I am completely off with my questions.  Its been a long time since I got into btc and i haven't kept up.

Is there an email address that the ransomware owners have or can you get in contact with them.  Honestly, you can write them.  I know it sounds funny but I have seen many scammers with good customer service i guess you could call it.
