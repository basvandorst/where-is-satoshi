Excellent post, except the last point. Power structures will not disappear and society will not become more equal, because they are the result of fundamental human nature which will not change. The people at the top may be replaced from time to time but the pyramid stays. All anarchistic Bitcoiners will protect their wealth the same way the current elites do. People seek power not because of scarcity of resources but because it is an innate human drive.

Producing the food could be done with very few people with today's technology. Most people work in useless jobs like developing Candy Crush or producing soap operas.

We have basic education, everyone knows how to read and write. Everyone should be taught life skills as well which they don't teach now.
The real problem is that there are power hungry parasites who want to exploit the weak and this is part of human nature which I highly doubt can be eliminated by education or love or anything, and that's why society is a pyramid of power rather than a flat utopia. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 12:29:25
It was just an example of inequality in the world but fair enough, I see your point.

Bullshit. At this point it's should be very obvious even to the average Joe that Bitcoin is here to stay and that the whole world is going to catch on in a couple of years, like all the other internet technologies of the last three decades - email, instant messaging, social networks, peer to peer economy like Airbnb and Uber, etc that became part of everyday life on a global scale. If you haven't yet caught on as to what is happening, you will in a year or two.

I opened the link but it doesn't seem relevant to me because whatever tax corruption is going on its just a symptom of human behavior which is the root of the problem.
Power structures could be built upon bitcoin too instead of income tax.

Not enough people know that. The reason they don't think for themselves is not because they're not smart enough but because the more intellectual you are, the more you're protecting your survival and will not venture out into the unknown or take irrational risks like leaving a "safe" job.
Intelligent people can be kept enslaved by logic, "this job earns great, you shouldn't risk losing your security for a silly dream".
It's much harder to control a stupid one who does whatever he wants.

You know wars are waged with the purpose of destroying resources and keeping the underclass poor, right? We live in times of abundance and so scarcity must be created artificially to maintain the existing social structure. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:18:18
Not infinitely because you shouldn't invest all of your Bitcoin - you need to leave some in case the value drops so you have to add to the collateral. But yeah you can leverage several times, I haven't thought of that. Don't know about flash crash.

That's the thing, resources are enough for everyone. Nobody needs to starve or even to work for a living with today's technology.

Good point. I guess they're so certain it'll go up that they're willing to take the risk. But why profit by lending USD? The lender would be better off investing that USD in BTC.

But then I have to place the order manually. Quite frankly, that's insane. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 11:39:58

And a buy order at $6,900 to limit my losses in case the price goes up.

@_date: 2018-09-28 05:45:30
No.

On the contrary, if everyone's basic needs are met people will do what they actually want to do and the world will flourish with people who love their jobs and put everything into it to make it perfect instead of disgruntled wage slaves who piss in your soup to stick it to the man. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 05:44:12
I placed the stop slightly above my sell price, to stop the losses if the price goes up. Now I want to place a limit order below my original sell price, to make the profit if the price goes down.

I think the reason we don't have rituals to become independent is because global society doesn't need independent adults.
In a tribe everyone has to hold their own. A global technocracy functions best when 90% of people are addicted and submissive.

You're right, I would phrase it more like people prefer to wallow in their addictions and have someone else manage their time and energy rather than make constant effort and striving themselves.

I've read somewhere long time ago about an experiment in deflationary currency that encourages people to save instead of spend which creates a more stable economy instead of a spiral of debt, but I'm no monetary expert.
Perhaps bitcoin is the answer. But it would be enough to just take care of everyone's survival needs, if we have competition on top of that that's fine.

Which nobody tried to check or enforce.
We can go on with this stupid discussion.. you are talking about theoretical rules you've read on the internet, I'm talking about what actually happened in reality.
I'm sure if you asked around you'll see that other people had the same experience that I had. Your theoretical information doesn't line up with what happens in the real world. It's either outdated or wrong in some other way.

If I'm in USD exactly at the all time low then yes I missed out on that position.
It *could* happen once in a while so to mitigate that I could split up the position to several smaller trades so that the most I could lose is like 1btc which I need to convert to USD anyway for my living expenses every couple of months.
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:22:05
A %1 drop is almost guaranteed. The only time I'll miss out on it is when I short exactly at the all time low from now on, meaning that I sell at $6,200 for example and the price will only go up from that point onward. It *could* happen once in a while so to mitigate that I could split up the position to several smaller trades so that the most I could lose is like 1btc which I need to convert to USD anyway for my living expenses every couple of months.
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:12:54


What do you mean? Maybe I'm using "short" incorrectly. I meant that I sell my BTC with the intention of buying it back later at a lower price. The most I could lose is the BTC I've sold, and I just "lose" it by converting it to USD and spending it, which I have to do at some point anyway.

If you look at the past chart there are long period of very slow growth with sudden bubbles that quickly pop. It looks like we're in a bubble like that now. Most people won't get into Bitcoin easily, only during a media hype when they're reminded of the last media hypes when they missed out on the opportunity. So growth will probably not be linear.

No, $6,300 is where it stops. No new people will ever hear about Bitcoin again. No more use cases will be found and adoption will not continue beyond what is now. A few people got in and had their fun but that's it. It's just a fad really of some nerds.

It's not likely if you look at the graph.

It's highly unlikely, too many depend on and are invested in bitcoin at this point to let it collapse completely.
Satoshi himself said that bitcoin will eventually either take over the world or drop to zero but nothing in between, in terms of risk that's very worthwhile to invest in.
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:49:36

If you apply them to historical data you should be able to measure their success rate in exact percentages.

I hope you're joking or trolling.
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:03:26
I can't know where the bottom is so no point in trying to catch it, from $4.4k to $6.3k it's %43, good enough profit.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:46:29
What's Bbands?
@_date: 2018-11-21 09:31:06
Under $1,000?! How did you arrive at that?
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:43:22
That's literally meaningless. Direction can change at any moment unexpectedly.
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:12:35
Very funny but I actually took the biggest loan I possibly could when it was $450 and it payed off a year later.
In the long term, bitcoin's rise in price is way more than any interest you'd pay for a loan. If you can get a loan for 7-8 years like I did, it's a no brainer.
And of course the worst case scenario is that you stay a slave for the rest of your life so you really have nothing to lose.
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:11:32

@_date: 2018-11-20 17:20:59
Why do you think it would go down to 1k?
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:38:44
I expect bitcoin to go up significantly in the long term, so it makes sense to hodl as many bitcoins as I can.
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:17:37
Can you explain in human terms?
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:27:02
No, it's risky but I'm willing to take that risk because of the higher profit. It's not the most stable and secure strategy but it's not wild gambling either.
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:28:56
Are you saying it'll go back up to $6k?
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:54:10
I'm not scared I'm trying to balance risk and security. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:43:19

Greed (speculative investment), transferring money worldwide instantly for nothing, keeping your money safe from governments, all the regular bitcoin shenanigans.
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:52:34


Thought about it but if it goes slumping for the next year then I'm fucked.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:07:07
My risk tolerance is pretty high and I can pay back the loan if things go south. Yeah most people play it safe but you have to take a risk sometimes if you want to get somewhere.
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:10:36
I need it.
Worst case it'll bounce back up, I'll rebuy and lost a small percentage of it.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:07:56
I can take a loan and pay it back with a job if making a profit on the dip doesn't work out.
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:38:11
I'm not "bragging" I'm asking for advice, maybe this is a financial situation that has a general rule to it.
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:38:14
Because I'm not working and my btc holdings are slowly evaporating. If I can make a bit of cash on 2-3 slightly risky investments, it'll pay my bills until the next bubble.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:09:49
They can't disallow it just as they can't stop bittorrent or any other distributed internet technology.
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:15:52
I can't cover it with my daily fiat account.
Still, isn't it better to pay back the loan little by little, even from the btc?
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:13:53


All my $$$ are in bitcoin so to buy more yes I need a loan.


It was a rhetorical question, idiot. I was saying that my previous statement which you dismissed as idiotic has made me rich. I wasn't being interested in your financial situation. Idiot.
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:11:04

I thought that the thing with arbitrage is that you're not timing the market.
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:04:06
If you can find even 1% difference, and you have a large sum to play with, you can make good money easily.
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:04:25
So you're keeping the loan.
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:16:33
They're all following bitcoin, and unlike bitcoin not all coins are very probable to go back up. Most shitcoins are pump and dump scams.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:46:15
Most people still don't know how to use it, just as email took 20 years from its invention until your grandma could use it, so will bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-21 09:33:43
You don't think this is a temporary dip? It'll keep going down? How did you arrive at that?
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:18:35
I don't live in the US, I don't think that applies to me.
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:44:05
Also it can be argued that you're trading a currency that is (reasonably) expected to go up in value for an inflationary fiat currency. It's only "minimizing risk" if you're thinking of fiat as the "real", "stable" money and of Bitcoin as the "virtual" "speculative" investment, while future history may prove things to be exactly the other way around.
Do you see any movie rental stores around anymore? Why are they gone? The same is already happening to hotels (Airbnb), taxis (Uber), and may very well happen to government money.
If you look at Bitcoin's price history, it would be sheer financial insanity to ever sell even a fraction of a bitcoin for anything, unless your life depends on it.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:25:59
What? If you knew you'd amassed as many bitcoins as possible when they were $1,000, $100, $10, etc. You think the growth is going to stop now? It's not even mainstream yet.
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:27:09
Not gonna day trade because I don't know how to do it but this opportunity is unmissable.
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:55:53
Of course that is the plan.
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:16:43
When will the loans be available?
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:25:34
Of course they don't know it's for bitcoin.
I would get a bigger loan if I could. Maybe if I pay it back they'll give me a bigger one?
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:28:48
That was my question, which ones are reliable. I'll try those you mentioned, thanks.
@_date: 2018-11-22 08:57:14
Where's the critical information?
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:00:50


That is extremely profitable.
Which alts do you trade?
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:42:34
Straddle the fence?
@_date: 2017-09-07 07:18:23
Actually that's a really good idea.
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:20:25
Later = in the post apocalypse after the fiat system collapsed?
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:17:12
I'm going to hold Bitcoin, not any other coin.
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:27:47
That's a matter of risk tolerance.
Since the gain from bitcoin is more than the interest of the loan, then from a purely objective point of view it is better to hodl.
Now the question is who can manage their emotions well enough to tolerate the sense of risk for a long period of time.
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:23:44
I need to exchange cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:36:25
I'm certain it will go up in the long term. There might be (probably will be) crashes and lows in the meanwhile.
@_date: 2017-09-08 08:11:04
Yeah I know I can do 1 / 0.15 to get the opposite rate but isn't there a chart anywhere that shows that rate over time?
@_date: 2017-09-06 08:57:46
But that 10% fiat invested in bitcoin earns more than the interest I pay on the loan.
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:25:42
How would that benefit anyone?
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:37:39


What? Couldn't understand the rest because the basic assumption is wrong.
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:09:56
No, I'm really conflicted about whether to repay the loan or not.
If I wanted praise and jealousy I would have said how much I earned in dollars.
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:57:59
Yeah it occurred to me too.
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:04:07
It's not about greediness, it's about what is the financially smart thing to do. The interest on the loan is nothing compared to the gains from the bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:31:11
I didn't sell at 6k because I want to keep my money in btc in case it goes up.
If I sell at 6k and then the next bubble happens, I'll miss the greatest financial opportunity of my life.
What I \*can\* do however, is to get a crypto backed loan and buy more btc with it now at the dip, hoping it will go up again and I'll make a nice profit.
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:15:19
They returned all the coins to the users though.
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:41:17
The price of the forked one might go down significantly. BCash sells for $300 now. $880 might be a great deal. I don't think anyone will replace Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:19:20
How am I losing anything here? I can't lose. If Bitcoin drops I only need to add some USD to balance until Bitcoin rises back up.
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:55:54
Any reason why it's crashing now?
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:21:54
Because he paid for someone to be murdered.
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:35:16
I don't consider the event that Bitcoin fails completely a likely scenario. I'm willing to bet having to work for the rest of my life on the chance that that happens, which is already the case if I don't take the risk.
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:54:14
Of course I make monthly payments, the dilemma is whether to pay back the entire loan at once.
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:55:18
Why doesn't everyone do it then?
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:19:39
Mortgages have interest rates that take Inflation into account. What you're describing only happens when Inflation spikes fast and economies collapse, in that case yes you got away with not having to pay the mortgage. Once in a century.
Millionaires don't need to come up with creative ways to increase their wealth, there are many solid investment options available to them.
Nothing in the current economic structure is good for the poor. The poor get exploited by the rich. Next thing you're going to bring out "trickle down economy".
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:09:48
Every time you take advantage of the big swings you make a small profit. But the last time you try to do it, the price will keep going up and will never come down enough for you to close your short position, and so you lost the opportunity to make gains on those %20-%30 btc that are now fiat. This loss is more than all your small profits combined.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:20:14
I don't believe Bitcoin will crash to zero. The likelihood of that happening is next to nothing. Too many have vested interest in keeping it alive.
@_date: 2017-09-06 10:47:53
To net equal means to return the loan?
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:01:55
It's in 35 days. Still a long time to go. Why is Bitcoin rising now?
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:07:42
So what if bitcoin goes down in the short term? In the long term it will only go up, better to hodl.
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:08:35
So your risk tolerance is low :)
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:32:30
I don't need to put back USD in the balance immediately as Bitcoin drops. They have rules that it only happens in certain cases. Bitcoin needs to drop a lot for that to happen. Either way I can use let's say only $800k out of the $1m, to have a buffer, and I still get a good leverage.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:29:50


True, because most people don't even have the option to make their own financial decisions, they are caught up in an endless quicksand rat race and are used to someone else managing their time and energy in exchange for perceived security, which is itself false and only reflects their fear of change and misadaptability. But hopefully Bitcoin will change that, once people have the option to live better they might take it.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:20:17
What exactly is your strategy?
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:49:07


So when that happens you convert BTC to alt and alt to USD? And when the alts rise in BTC value, you convert USD to alts and alts to BTC?
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:28:57
You have some good points there.
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:24:13
When do you buy back? When it drops %5? %10??
@_date: 2017-09-09 01:06:31
No not US.
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:56:26
It will sink in the short term but in the long term it only goes up.
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:20:14
Where can I do that with bitcoin and what's a margin call?
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:32:31
Or writing a trading bot to do it.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:45:15
People didn't "choose" to use Visa and banking. It was the only way until now, to have a "trusted" (betraying power hungry) third party keep a list of account balances. There was no other way to do it, until the global internet appeared and Satoshi mathematically solved the Generals Problem.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:45:26
Is it possible that S2X will be worth more after the fork than the current futures price? What was the Bitcoin Cash precedent?
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:42:33
What if it drops for a while and then rises in the long term? Do I soul win?
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:55:56
You used a decimal point at $4.000, also inconsistently with the previous time you used no thousands separator ($4000), I assume you meant $4,000.
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:33:44
Of course it will. The question is whether it will drop first or not.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:41:32
Any reason not to do it?
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:59:23
Still don't understand leveraging. What can you do with your supposed 100BTC? You can't sell any of them I assume, so at no point you actually have more than 1BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-07 04:41:32
Do it motherfucker.
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:52:21
How do I do that?
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:12:55
Warren Buffet doesn't understand the significance of a trustless decentralized currency in an era of loss of trust in traditional institutions who abuse their concentrated power.
Furthermore as someone who is heavily invested in traditional economy he has an unconscious motive to maintain and sustain the old values. It is not in his best interest to understand the economic revolution of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:32:51
Do you always reinvest when it drops? Otherwise your btc holdings are gradually decreasing instead of actually HODLing.
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:51:51
You get 100BTC for $4?
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:54:35
The problem is that centralized power always gets abused, because of human nature.
And BTC's deflationary structure is a good thing. People saving up and only spending when they really have to is good for the economy. The downward spiral of ever increasing consumption, spending, and planned obsolesce is what causes economies to collapse.
@_date: 2017-09-07 03:07:09
You don't need to execute the trades at the same time. If the price now is $4,400, I can place a buy order at $4,600 at one exchange and another sell order at $4,800 at another exchange and wait. As long as both are executed eventually, I'll make a profit.
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:57:18
It might be a good idea to cash out the new coin now before the fork when it's worth more.
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:15:00
Can't trade on them sadly.

Individual rich people are not "bad", but the economic structure of society is oriented toward the strong exploiting the young and the weak. Everyone has a TV at home but the shows and movies don't tell you truths about life which will help you live in the world, quite the opposite. They tell very convincing lies that keep you in illusion about human nature, until reality and real life smash that illusion. Advertisements prey on natural human weaknesses and impulses that almost no one can resist. Mass media puts extraordinary effort into nurturing your addictions and keeping you in a state of childish dependence on authority structures well into your adult life. Everyone is being pushed into debt. Public education indoctrinates you into being an intellectual slave. Anything of any importance to independence and real life skills is not taught at school - the basics of finance, self restraint. Sex education class tells you all about biological reproduction but says nothing about pleasure and love which are the main functions of sex. Instead, every household has an unlimited supply of free hardcore porn in their living room two clicks away for every teenager. Natural human impulses of group solidarity are channelled into military aggression for the financial benefit of a small elite. Western Civilization alienates you from your humanity, it is exploiting the individual rather than supporting them.
