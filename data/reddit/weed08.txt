You know... it will be kinda awesome if he'd really eat his own dick off. Always have respect for a man of his own words.

Eh? I do think it's a crash though. A crash is rapid and unticipated drop in price. Did we anticipate the drop? Some might've.
Even then, crash or not, BTC will recover. The tech is continuously advancing. We just need more merchants utilizing bitcoin so that we're closer to mass adoption c:

Here we'll see the tenacity of the hodlers. They fended off the drop below the 6.8k level... will they do it again though?

Not bashing or anything but why do you think whales are doing the dumping? The way I see it, folks only see Bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme and is losing confidence because of the price drop. Once we shake all of them out then we might probably see a healthier market? Or this might be like the crash of 2008 where it's every man for himself in the crypto market...

Why is it a scam? It does what it's supposed to do. It's not a get rich quick scheme lol.
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:19:23
Lol. And the guys from r/btc keep on spouting that their community is better because there's no censorship. Pure BS

If we can go above 8.6k next week (4 hrs) then I'd say we have a chance to rise for the short term. But I think we still have a long way to go if we look at the daily charts. Just giving my 2 satoshis.

Good luck  dude!!! Hope it goes well

If the hodlers let go now then Bitcoin might plummet down to low levels. Whether that's a good thing for those who wants to buy at a lower price or a bad thing for those who got burned is dependent on the individual.

Oh ok. Thanks for the info!

Maybe. Maybe it's Maybelline.

You know what the article stated? "With so many companies taking a strong liking to Bitcoin Cash as of late, it would not be all that surprising to see this alternative currency being implemented."
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:43:22
I think I worded my post incorrectly... but I agree with you though.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:07:01
I agree. Why are a lot of people speculating that those at fault are the whales? Whale or not, the drop is scaring off new investors and even getting the better of hodlers.

I wouldn't really call it either bullish or bearish. It's just that the FSB is taking a wait and see attitude towards bitcoin. Carney did however stress that they should monitor blockchain tech once all their backlogs get done. What we should look out for is the one who will oversee cryptos in the near future.
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:09:51
I think we should all just see this as Bitcoin's fair price at the moment. Sure it's good if it moons but if we'll just hurt and exhaust ourselves if we keep placing our expectations on Bitcoin everyday. Just believe in the tech.

Long time lurker here! Hope people use Bitcoin as a means of exchange now that price seems to have stabilized.
