Warren Buffet also owns stocks of 2 tech companies: IBM since 2011 and Apple since 2016.
He missed out on the extreme growth of tech companies and the making of giants such as Google, Facebook or Amazon.
By his own admission, he doesn't invest in what he doesn't understand and he obviously isn't tech-savvy. 
As much as one can respect his general investing advice, I wouldn't take any advice on tech from him.

Could? It's already used as a hedge in troubled economies  like Venezuela and Zimbabwe.
However, I'd really like to see original Goldman report. Everyone is referencing it, but no one provided their source.

Another dude joining in agreement. If we have anyone who received it, it'd be very nice to post it.

You're giving USA way too much credit.

Monero is mined using CPUs so it's suspectible to website miners and botnets.

I'm afraid that tweet would pump BCH.

I'm almost 100% sure he has no idea what he's talking about, so he just repeats what he's been reading on for the past years.

A true moron can't understand it's sarcasm even when it is spelled out to them.

Found the guy who sold under $14k.

It's a bubble that's popping because I'm a dumbass who says so!

Here's the deal. Most alts are paired with and traded against Bitcoin. That means any BTC/USD action will affect alts too.
If people want to go fiat, first they need to sell their alts for bitcoin and only then can they sell Bitcoins for cash.
Alts will thrive when BTC stagnates or slowly grows, any other type of huge price action will hurt them.

You're making the mistake of treating an asset as a company.

That's because money flows in, some profit taking and mostly dumb money flows out. Some people stay around tho.

Bitcoin is both how the blockchain idea started and the first application of it. It's not just a currency, it's a father &amp; poster boy of blockchain technology.

Truth is people throw around Ponzi/pyramid scheme as a buzzword without knowing what it actually is.

No lol, company is a legal entity, asset is an economic resource.

It was supposed to be $10k by April 2018 according to most predictions, in September.

A cryptocurrency that is completely centralized and controlled by the government?
That's not a cryptocurrency, just digitalized tokens trying to disguise as one for some good marketing. If it weren't government issued, I'd bet my ass on it being a scam.

Big guys are starting to look into it &amp; making their plans known, it's become more &amp; more widespread. Bitcoin is still some time away from hitting true mainstream, but it's gaining massive momentum. Maybe it won't explode like for the past year percentage wise, but there is still much room to grow.
There are estimates of it hitting $10 000 by April. Back in August, I remember reading (optimistic) estimates that Bitcoin will hit $4000 by the end of the year. Look where we are now.
The cryptocurrency market in general is interesting. Most of them had a huge boom in their value in 2017. They just need to be picked by larger companies like how Microsoft expressed interest in Etherum.

This is old, now they're worth $24 millions. He sold a fifth back then, hopefully he held on much of the rest.

For all intents and purposes, they're not too different for a general consumer.
But Nano can be considerably cheaper. I wanted faster shipping and I paid only 100 euros for Nano, whereas it would cost me 145 for Trezor.

Try it, $150 is not that much.

I hope it stabilises a bit, gotta make those deposits.

Good call, I'm planning on that as well. They could get a price spike once they move from PoW to PoS sometime in late 2018, no more mining then.
Altcoins in general will probably dip a bit since people are selling them to get bitcoin before the fork. And it's best to get them at dips.
Check out Iota. It's something completely new and different from blockchain, focusing on IoT. Its value is low and the graph at first doesn't look promising, but the technology behind is interesting and a novelty. I think it's worth putting some chump change into it and forgetting about it for a bit, like people did with Bitcoin way back in time.

You should as far as I know. Hardware and paper wallets are safe bets.

I guess you paid those movies fair &amp; square in the end lol.

If any exchange would even accept it, which I doubt. 
Buying btc with fiat is easy anyways.

The most popular is Bitfinex.

There's no possibility of replay attack until the fork happens, so you're safe now.
