Not necessarily. if you can gauge the market correctly, you can sell a and then reinvest at a lower price point. You only lose money once the price+fees is greater than your initial payout. But most people get burned this way, easier to hodl and ride it out

I think your "friend" believes you are telling him to purchase a whole bitcoin for $10k, as if he can afford to risk that much, which, judging by his response, is clearly not feasible. He/she may not understand that you can buy fragments for pocket change, sort of like an "anything counts".
 Either that or you might be a pompous dick who regularly throws out his current financial situation to  feel a sense of superiority over people, and this is just another time. Idk enough to make assumptions

Everything has a peak. Only a few people will accurately approximate bitcoin's peak and even less will act on it. We've seen it happen many times before in US economic history. "But cryptos are different" is true to an extent and futures trading will surely reduce its differences. I'm still down for the ride though
