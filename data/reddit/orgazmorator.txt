As long as the redistribution is voluntary. Anything else would be dystopian.

The resource is the reproduction system of the women. Which is a scarce resource unlike mens sperm of which there is an abundance. Is it fair that some men get access to more than one woman, while other men get no sex at all?
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:44:25
You could say the same about people who are unable to provide for themselves. They suck and their DNA is weeded out.

Then the stupid people will use fractional reserve and learn an expensive lesson while the rest of us stick to real money.
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:48:07
I think people will need mortgages much less after the central bank has died. 90% of all money exists as debt. Once fractional reserve banking is a thing of the past, we are left with the remaining 10% of money. There will be 90% less money bidding for the same number of houses, which means the prices will be 90% lower in nominal terms. In my country you need a 15% down payment to be allowed to get access to the fractional reserve money so you can buy a house. The down payment will be enough to buy the house.

And by fairly, I assume you mean more or less equally? One of the most important resources were women who got to chose which men were allowed to make babies. Do you think the number of babies per man were distributed fairly? 
Hint: Only 1/3 of your ancestors were males.
My point is that in order to change this "unfairness" you would have to commit mass rape. To change the "unfairness" of a free market, you would also have to get violent.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:24:09
They don't want voluntary collectivism. They want everybody to be part of their one and only collective, which requires use of violence.

It could exist, but why would anyone want fractional reserve bitcoins?
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:43:27
One trillion is nothing. That is a lousy three months worth of inflation by the US plus EU plus China. Gold has a $7 trillion market cap. It is estimated that $21 trillion is illegally hidden in tax havens. $50 000 bitcoins will still be very cheap.
@_date: 2014-08-01 10:35:10
One million dollars per bitcoin is totally possible. It is estimated that 21 trillion dollars are hidden illegally in tax havens. If all that money finds its way into bitcoin, we are already at one million dollar per coin.

There is nothing liberatarian about punishing someone for the crimes of their ancestors.

"The vast, vast majority of people are not libertarians. It is a fringe position."
Argumentum ad populum is invalid.
Libertarianism is not the opposite of people having different opinions. It's actually a system that allows people to act peacefully on their opinions even if they are a minority. Majority rule, on the other hand, is a system where only the majority gets to act on their opinions. I prefer diversity and peace to coersion.

The government just gives you the right to wait in line for health care. There are no guarantees that you will get it in time. Often people wait for years.
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:57:57
Both Sweden and the US are good examples of what happens when the government interferes in health care. Health care is too important to leave to the idiot politicians.
@_date: 2014-01-23 21:03:20
Private nature?!!? The US spends more public money on health care per capita than Sweden. In addition they have a so-called private insurance, which in reality is also controlled by the government. They deceide who gets to buy insurance, from whom, at what price and what the insurance must cover. 
If you have life-saving food, I will pay anything for it... if we disregard the fact that you are not the only one selling food.
Singapore's health care is much less socialist than that of Sweden. The government forces you to buy health insurance, but you have much more freedom in who you buy it from.
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:28:14
The money is stolen and then spent on shitty health care, shitty housing, and shitty safety nets. The United States spend more government money on health care per capita than Sweden does and that's why they also have shitty health care. We get more value for our money when they are not pissed away by bureaucrats. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 10:14:36
How about we agree on a place at the airport where buyers and sellers could just sit around waiting for people who want to exchange? It would be a Satoshi corner. Maybe Bitcoin is already big enough for something like this to work in the larger airports? Or we could use an app where you just input your price and when you will be at the airport?

Couldn't the key just be a message that is one part of a multisig wallet where the recipient has the other key? That way the lawyer wouldn't even know what's going on.
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:22:26
Everyone is not happy here and I am especially pissed off about the prices of health care. When the government controls something it becomes expensive and shitty.
@_date: 2014-09-26 13:06:19
A broken clock is right twice a day. The practice you speak of is naturally damaging to the economy, but it's not necesseraliy true that only the incompetent receive funding. Just like monkeys, bureaucrats can get lucky and pick a winning stock.
@_date: 2014-03-02 14:06:06
Please proove that the US economy has been deregulated. And by that I don't mean show me one or two regulations that have been removed. I'm talking about you proving that overall the economy is less regulated now than before.
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:24:37
Then you do that. But please tolerate those who won't and don't support oppressing them.

Buying gas by the gallon is insane! By it by the milliliter instad. Much cheaper.

Could it be possible to create a will that is enforced through the blockchain? You enter a list of public adresses where you want your bitcoins to go when you die. As long as you sign in with your private key every six months, or whatever time period you have chosen, the bitcoins stay in your adress. When you die, six months will pass without you signing in, and the will is executed.
@_date: 2014-07-27 17:42:41
You can refuse to comply, but then people with guns will try to hunt you down and use force against you.

It's not self elected for the minority. The majority is not being robbed, but the minority is. They never agreed to this.
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:57:34
The central banks can always push the price of their currencies down. People with a lot of bitcoins, can only push the price down as long as they still have bitcoins. When they have sold them all, they have no more power to do so.

Less socialism does not cause worse health care and safety systems. The freer the economy, the better off we are.

These types of funds are definitely not given only to startups that have a bright future. The people who decide are bureaucrats who are gambling with other peoples money. They are of course less likely to pick a winner than those who gamble with their own money.

Good point. It would be impossible for any other entity than a government to build roads.

The only reason people don't resist being locked up, is because they will be murdered if they do so. Without the threat of violence, people wouldn't let the government treat them as slaves.
@_date: 2015-05-25 11:24:41
Every country will murder its people if they resist taking the punishment. Imagine what would happen if you refused to pay taxes. First they send you some bills saying that you have to pay taxes plus interests. If you refuse long enough, people will try to invade your home and take your things. If you don't let them in, police will come, and if you defend yourself from their violence, they will murder you.
@_date: 2015-05-27 20:19:31
If someone is stealing your car, it is fair to stop them. If you try to stop the police from kidnapping you, you will be shot. The only reason I follow the fascist laws, is because I don't want to get shot. That is also the reason why slaves didn't escape more than they did.

The Scandinavian countries are among the 40 most capitalist (economically free) countries in the world.

Hyperbole? Are you saying you don't risk being murdered if you refuse to do as the government tells you?

There is a positive correlation between happiness and economic freedom:

A libertarian nation would recognize that the government shouldn't be involved in the monetary system and would have no official currency.

Correlation does not imply causation.

Then most people are wrong. The government has virtually no money of its own. All it can do is take money or assets by force from the rightful owners. The only exeption would be when people donate their property to the government, but all the government's income is definitely not obtained that way.
@_date: 2015-02-06 00:04:57
SEED is partly financed by the government, meaning that some of the money they are investing, is not backed by the consent of the rightful owners.
@_date: 2015-02-07 13:22:51
It proves my original statement. The people who decide are bureaucrats who are gambling with other peoples money.
@_date: 2015-02-06 00:02:11
And SEED receives no money from the government?
