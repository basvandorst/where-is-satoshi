Says the guy attacking strangers on the internet LOL. You are one pathetic loser!

You are a pedantic and pathetically sad person. I’m sorry it threatens you that I purchased a more-expensive-than-average car with a fun license plate that shows what I care about. I hope you learn to enjoy life a little more because you come off as bitter and depressed.

Nope completely incorrect, I am advertising my love of Bitcoin. I drive nice cars because I like to drive nice cars, and I am allowed to spend my money however I want in a free country. Everyone driving a sports car isn't immature and insecure, however people make comments like you on internet forums are obviously insecure. You are a totally pathetic human being.

Use poloniex? Fee structure way better and no-fee fiat deposits other than what wire transfer charges...

Very good question. I report everything to the tax man and have nothing to hide, so I’m happy to promote the cause. Also I live in a building with many cameras and security systems so I don’t feel like I’d be threatened more than anyone else in a major city. But I totally get the sentiment.
