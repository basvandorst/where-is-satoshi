He talks about having doubts because crypto isn't tangible. That's the entire point, it can't be seized from you physically like other forms of money or value. You can't instantly send something tangible to anywhere in the world. Comon Ron Paul.

That's only if people decide to keep playing their game. I think Bitcoin eventually will mean the disintegration of greedy vampire like organizations like the IRS. It is clearly at least highlighting how ridiculous they actually are and why the hell do we all just agree to pay those fuckers anyways, if something allowed people as a whole to start to escape them if they chose, kind of like bitcoin does, it could be the start of the end for them. We can only hope.

Your wrong. Think about it this way, every order on Overstock is sell btc order for overstock but a buy order for Coinbase, same thing with TigerDirect and Bitpay. Adding merchants to the market will also help Bitcoin much more longterm.

It is a good thing. If they declared it a currency there would be all sorts of roadblocks put in place and unnecessary regulation. This just means BTC treated same as gold. 
The IRS really just knows wall street getting into BTC soon and they would be crazy not to have system in place where they can tax the big dogs.
As for normal people, it will be up to you, just like its up to a server to declare how much tips $ he makes every day. All I know is that most servers claim like ~15% of the actual tips they make. No real way for the IRS to know or not know how many BTC you have in your wallet. Even if you bought 1 BTC off coinbase how does the IRS know you didn't just buy it for someone else as a gift or your buying it for a friend.
Most people still won't pay taxes on BTC unless of course you are buying merchandise from a store or online which you would pay sales tax just like with cash. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 02:31:44
So you can only get BTC from coinbase? No.
@_date: 2014-04-01 02:34:40
Really???? cause when I was a server for about 2 years I only claimed about $15-$20 per night when I really made $120+ a night in tips. I got away. So you my friend are WRONG

@_date: 2014-02-10 19:16:40
This was an obvious mistake for those of you who aren't intelligent enough to realize. Its very easy to make a sell order by accident for the wrong amount. I have done it once and lost about $100. I GUARANTEE you that is what happened. No one in the right mind would sell 4k+ BTC or however many he sold $500 below the current price. Comon people use your brain.

@_date: 2014-01-24 11:21:05
No. When Overstock turns BTC to USD "instantly" Coinbase does the exact thing with those $ and buys that amount of BTC instantly, so it offsets. Same thing with tiger and bitpay. Adding merchants will only increase the value of Bitcoin longterm.
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:34:53

It's very interesting, the webbot predicted this year a currency crisis instigated by the derivatives and bonds markets particularly in EU. It also describes a Chinese gov't embracing Bitcoin and going all in, because it wants wealth and prosperity for its people across the board. It makes them a stronger nation. I have to agree with the webbot and what you are saying!

Yes exactly, who knows they could be planning on buying tons of bitcoins and hyperinflating the dollar purposely and they could convert bitcoins to $ like we can. When we all think thats what they don't want. Who knows, then they could try to crash bitcoins in a huge dump and move over to gold

1) The PBC has basically given the green light for bitcoin trading and exchanges.  They are trying to keep bitcoin trading "separate" from the other parts of the financial system so that if bitcoin blows up, then nothing bad will happen.  The thing that I think they are worried about is a Lehman style situation in which something blowing up in derivatives brings down the rest of the economy.
The strategy of creating a ring fence around new markets is a very standard one in China.  Hong Kong is an entire city that is ring fenced.
2) Not terribly much.  It only started to get on the radar screen a month ago.
3) The main driver is that there are tons of money in China and no one knows what to do with it all.  The traditional investments (real estate and stocks) have been closed off by government action since the government has made it clear they will kill any bubble in the real estate and stock markets.  So the money is going into all sorts of "non-traditional" investments.  Bitcoin is just one of them.
4) Geeks.  So far it's not the type of thing that random people will buy.
5) It's not very mainstream.  However, its taken the Chinese geek community by storm and there are a lot of geeks in China.  As with a lot of Chinese things, the fraction of people in China who are geeks is small, but a small fraction times a billion is a lot of people.
6) No harder than it is to buy anything else online.
Bitcoin has not gotten much mainstream attention and its still something that is with geeks, but you have the perfect storm of a lot of other things.  The main thing is that bitcoin has hit China exactly at the time where China is looking at restructuring its entire economy and financial system to move out of low tech industries into high tech ones.  It also hit China at just the right time in the credit cycle.  China has recovered from the 2008 crash and is just starting to enter into another boom phase (which will last about two to three years before the economy crashes again).

All this will blow over once people realize this isnt really bad news at all. 
"It's excellent news for bitcoin.  Essentially bitcoin exchanges in China and bitcoin itself is going to be treated as a "commodity" rather than a "currency" and therefore not going to be subject to banking and currency control regulations.  The only restrictions on bitcoin exchanges is that they will be subject to the standard internet censorship rules and they will need to get the identity of all users to prevent money laundering.  Existing financial institutions will not be able to trade bitcoin, but this is a *great* thing for entrepreneurs."

It takes longer if the small transaction fee was not paid. Just because you paid the atm fee doesn't mean the atm itself paid the bitcoin processing fee which could mean it takes up to 24 hours. I originally transferred 100% of my wallet to another address without the transaction fee and it took like 20 hours I was freaking out. Should take no longer than 8 minutes normally. The technology is still infant, do you judge a man while he is a baby?
