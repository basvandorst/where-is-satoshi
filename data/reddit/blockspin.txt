Thanks for posting, glad to hear you were happy with the service :-)

This is not in any way a Ponzi scheme. We either make a profit or a loss on each auction. For example, we lost out on the first 5BTC auction, but that's fine as we are just getting started and happy to cover the loss.

We paid the winnings out from a different address:

We are not in this to scam anyone, if it ever gets to the point where we are losing too much, we will refund current auctions and close down the site (with no losses to users).
This is the first of a number of apps we intend to release; the others are mainly utilities, rather than e-commerce or games.
* We have a limited company (registered at Companies House)
* This has a registered address in central London, but I don't see it wise to post here.
* The WHOIS records were the default settings of the registrar.
* We only launched a week ago and are working on our front-facing site (blockspin.com)
With regards the law;
We have added a gamification layer to convert Bitcoins into products. Users can choose at what point to bid; if they add higher miners fee, it will get accepted into a block; they need to be the final bidder to win. It is up to users when to strategically place their bid on a given auction, and there are things they can do to disuade others from bidding; this is not chance.
The most comparable real-world services are Dealdash, Madbid or QuiBids; these are not gambling services under UK or US law.

5 Bitcoins about to close at 0.09BTC: 
This will get paid out and prizes will be sent, we are willing to cover any losses and realise that we will likely lose money on the first few auctions.
As we've just launched we have no "provable" winners yet, but are happy to pay 0.5BTC if the first few winners who provide a testimonial:

We are not bidding as this would be short-sighted and ruin our reputation. No licence is required to run this type of auction, and we only accept bids in Bitcoins.
We are working on an updated design for the blockspin.com homepage, this will have more details about us. Is there anything in particular you would like to know?

We've just launched  , a play on penny auctions built on top on the blockchain.
- Bid to a specific auction address
- Auctions last for a certain number of blocks - When blocks reach 0, each new bid extends the auction by 3 blocks
- There needs to be 3 empty blocks for a winner to be declared (no bids for 3 consecutive blocks released by the Bitcoin network)
- The highest bid wins (we send winning, and losing transactions when you have been outbid)
- Winner creates a signed message to confirm they own the winning Bitcoin address

Auction for 5 coins: 
The auction for 5 coins is due to end soon, so place your bids ;-)
We're always looking to improve and if anyone has any feedback (e.g. "WTF is this, how does it work??), or thoughts; they are much appreciated!
