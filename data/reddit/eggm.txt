It's the guy who hacked nicehash. He activated his day trading bot.

2008, and the fact that the feds constantly print money.

I never meant to imply to just sit on a pile of cash in your house lol.  Right now your safest bet is to get gold / Bitcoin.

As much as I'd like to think you're right, I think realistically it'll be great if we just get a tiny percentage of the people who panic into gold.  I don't expect it to be massive though.  Probably pretty minimal, but it's still positive overall, and the percentage that comes from panic into gold will increase overtime.

Yeah that works too, you just gotta watch out for how much the government can keep increasing the property taxes.  You still pay them even if you own the property / land outright. :(

Can they use it through Tor browser so it's onion routed?

This is really awesome and should be the stuff featured at the top! :)

Because governments force the exchanges to.  Once you get your initial BTC from an exchange, make the switch to bisq instead.

Yeah, aside from always sincerely saying that the price is the least interesting thing about Bitcoin, he truly does just want to educate and speak about it from a pure nerd standpoint.  It's great!

I have so so so much more knowledge about this topic and agree the article sold it short, but there's only so much you can cram into the article and expect newbies to read it / get it.  I plan to have follow up articles on the Revolution in trust, lightning network, mining, day trading, buying with no fees / exchanges, wallets and wallet software, altcoins, and much more.  
You're preaching to the choir with this response haha! I've watched every single Andreas video and fully believe in a lot that you are saying.  I've also read mastering Bitcoin and am a programmer and checkout the github from time to time.

I am aware of the recent fee increases Bitcoin suffered.  During that small period of Bitcoin's 9 year history, small transactions might have had higher fees than Banks.  However, for larger transactions, it was still cheaper, as well as for most of Bitcion's history, and they have since worked to fix the issue (at least seemingly for now, we'll see after it ramps back up again), and in the run I think they will remain low, so I choose not to bring that debate up in the article for newcomers.  
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:00:22
Yeah, that's true.  
I guess now that I think about it, this is more geared towards people who have an interest, but want a deeper understanding on a conceptual level.  
Getting Ellen's 3 million on board is a tough task....

Amazed.  Because whatever technology prompted him to talk about it, would be incredible, otherwise he wouldn't be talking about it over Bitcoin.

I probably should edit that to say, "What we know today as a "traditional" bank is, because Bitcoin will drastically change the way they work."
I will admit to not fully understand banks / the current way money works, but I do want to learn more.
Could you help me fill the gaps? 
The way I see it, the only service that Crypto can't currently facilitate is loaning money.  But, couldn't there be an entity in the future, federally backed / insured, that has a ton of Crypto lying around to loan out to public keys (Tied to verified identities) with a good credit score? 
With money not being backed by gold, and becoming more and more digital, I can't see how physical buildings with vaults, guards, and armored trucks and stuff would be necessary anymore? I also don't see the need for two people to meet in a physical building to discuss their creditworthiness and get a loan (You can already do it fully online with like Quicken Loans or something).

Really great point! I truly and honestly didn't think about it that way. This was my first article I've ever written on anything, I will get better. :) 
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:08:24
Banks already implement cloud technology. Maybe you meant do you think they aren't developing their own crypto currency?
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:17:32
This was exactly my goal! Thanks so much for this feedback.  I'm glad you liked it, I will be writing more in the same method going over different topics about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:41:24
Hey Tom,
I'm so glad you enjoyed it! It's the first like official "article" or anything I've written on the subject.  Please share it with friends who are thinking of getting into Bitcoin if you don't mind.  
I'll make a part 2 with a focus on mining and send you the link via PM. 
Thanks for the motivation! :)
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:00:37
Thanks, I'll review and edit it!
Edit: Done.

You can, but you can also buy it through Coinbase and transfer it to GDAX instantly and for free.  From GDAX you can click the withdraw button and send it to any wallet / other person's wallet for 100% no fees to you.  There's like 9 million youtube videos about this if you want to see where all the buttons to click are.

Hey Tom,
I just finished writing an article for newbies to bitcoin. It's targeted at giving people that AHA! Moment. It only briefly touches on mining but I'd love to give you more info on mining after you read it. 
I'd also love to get your thoughts on if you found the article useful. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:25:31
The point of the blowing up the computers was just to drive home the concept of what the cloud is / how it works on a basic level, and that Bitcoin's network is the biggest amount of connected computers ever.  Obviously this is a super unlikely thing to ever happen in either scenario.
The yacht thing was just to give people motivation to make it through the article, realistically I know that most people will not have the initial capital to invest enough to make enough to buy a yacht 10 years down the road.

Sounds way better than here in the US lol.  We can sometimes avoid our monthly maintenance fee if our direct deposit is big enough.  Transfers are usually only free for transfers to and from the same bank.  ATM withdraw is the same, it's free only if your bank's ATM's.
