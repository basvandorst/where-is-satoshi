My experience as well. Coinbase has been nothing but solid and reliable.

I believe it's a discrepancy between the all time high of the price index and the all time high on Gox.

My understanding based on their blog post is that you can still perform this operation. You can convert your btc into fiat, then deposit that fiat to you bank account. I don't think you'll be able to directly purchase bitcoin through Circle moving forward.

Don’t move them. When the split happens, Ledger will allow you to split your coins to use BTC, B2X, or both as you wish.  If you don’t want to split, you will be able to continue using your BTC as normal.

Correct! Your coins as they are right now will be compatible to *send*on both chains following the fork, no matter if they are in a legacy or segwit wallet. The tool Ledger will provide will ensure that your coins on the current chain will be able to be safely spent on both chains after the split.

Can't recommend credit unions highly enough.

Look into dollar cost averaging.  I had the exact same thought as you when I started investing 3 years ago.  I got in when Bitcoin was ~$300 and thought I had missed the good times (when Bitcoin was cents or a few dollars).  I invest a small amount each week, the same amount every week, and I've seen a massive return on that investment.  It's just like any investment - it won't feel like much at first, but over time it will grow a lot.  The key is to get started and let time do the work.  Bitcoin still has tremendous upside potential, even at $5,000.
