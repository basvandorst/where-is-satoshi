That's cute, low 5 figures, way down the list. If you think that's the price of a senator, you're a bit low. 
No, this is a dumb, technophobic west virginia democrat sucking up to his dumb, technophobic west virginia democrat constituents.

This (non-cryptocurrency related) patent, if granted, wouldn't cover all currency exchanging, it would cover a very specific system for doing it (presumably the one they use or will use somewhere). 
They aren't patenting an idea/invention ('conversion of currency'). They are patenting the design for a system ('the specific system we've built for converting currencies, to the extent it is unique and non-obvious')

Uhhh, that's not misleading cherry picking. He just didn't write the story you wanted to. He decided not to use any significant parts of your interview (this happens), but needed a quote from someone stating what they believed they had lost, and something you said fit. 
The fact that you were interviewed doesn't define what story the journalist has to write. The world doesn't revolve around you.

The highly financial services related press being better at covering the goings on related to a financial innovation?!
Next you are going to tell me that the financial services industry finds bitcoin interesting, and isn't involved in a NWO conspiracy to kill bitcoin!

A decentralized currency where you can be in control of your own money?
Why not let a community pariah with long-standing technical, legal and business problems hold it for you!

The greater flaw is that libertarians don't tell you not to take money when the government sends it to you. It's that the government shouldn't have done the thing. 
Its not like she could have refused the corresponding taxes...
Libertarians don't say, if the government taxes you 20 dollars, and then sends you back 18, you should refuse that 18 dollars, they just say the government shouldn't have done that dumb thing.

Inherently, a secret is stored somewhere. You are basically lying. Please go away.

If bitcoin replaced all currency on the planet, its value wouldn't quite relatively increase as much as I've seen it do.

Of course it is, and this in meaningless. For it to be illegal would be rediculous beyond belief. Even the Chinese Communist Party has not declared it illegal to trade bitcoin (only tried to greatly impede the ability to do so with regulation). The statement isn't even 'bitcoin is legal'. It's 'bitcoin has a bunch of problems, but we aren't explicitly regulating with this statement'. 
No western country is going to declare bitcoin illegal. They are initially just going to classify it like a currency, or commodity, or money transferring system, or..., and apply existing regulations. This will mostly be random since its interpretation of, what are in reality, non-cryptocurrency-intended regulations.  Legislators will then slowly begin reclassifying and re-regulating based on the whims of the day. Some of these regulations will be problematic, some won't. If Bitcoin's reputation continues to be more associated with the Silk Roads than anything positive, we may run into intentionally anti-bitcoin policy. Even then, illegality likely isn't in the cards. 
Nothing to see here folks.

Don't. That would be pointless. Your library needs access to the key. Obfuscating it would not actually protect it. If the user has malware running on there computer at the same access level as your software, the security failing is not yours. 
If the (library) user wants you to store the key, do it. If not, don't. It's that simple. Beyond that it's the end user's responsibility

Irrelevent. The fact that the business model of these banks actually charges a fee when it incurs a cost, instead of subtracting it or adding it to a different rate is actually superior. It encorages people to do more efficient tranactions/actions. Of course this bank may well overcharge on this fee, or on any other fee, but that is an entirely seperate matter (which is usually caused by regulation of the banking sector generally blocking effective competition).

Translation, I bought on hype, and am massively down tonight.

Of course it was simple PR. But that doesn't matter. They officially put themselves on record as 'pro', and 'its the future'. They aren't a really direct-to-consumer retailer, so any actual offers of payment processing weren't meaningful (if they wanted to use BTC in large wholesale transactions, they wouldn't be using a service like bitpay or coinbase). 
It was just a simple trade of some publicity in exchange for some good press. Good deal for both of our groups.

Bad, in so far as yesterday, there were more options for the Chinese to buy bitcoins, and therefore, more capital flowing into BTC.
However, as has always been the case, it has been known, and priced into intelligent investors decisions, that China would regulate hard to try to stop the leak in their capital controls. That one of these regulations has been announced really shouldn't be meaningful to you. This should have already been priced into your decisions. This shouldn't be bad news for you because it shouldn't really be news to you.

Difference: 
Current US regulation is a arcane, shitty mix of attempts to simultaneosly reign in and protect the financial sector. Regulators (i.e. not policy making officials or legislators), have interpretted these as meaning a bitcoin exchange needs to jump through more hoops then would be sane. 
The Chinese government, as a matter of policy, is trying to snuff out the threat of bitcoin to their capital controls.
I.e. The incompetance of US regulations will slowly be fixed by legislation, whereas China will get worse.

That would be useless security theatre. If the application using the library can read it, so can the malware on your computer. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:03:41
So? Presumabily this library needs to store the key to function sanely. Storing it in an area that can't be read by a usermode applications would require admin rights to applications using the library. Any obfuscation of the key would be pointless security theatre. 
What do you propose? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:35:47
You are quite incorrect to suggest that a browsers encryption of, say, saved passwords is in any way secure. It is trivial obfuscation, and is unwrapped by any interested malware. To the extent that it exists at all, it is a form or security theatre.
