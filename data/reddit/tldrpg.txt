This is like the equivalent to trusting an exchange, depends on your risk tolerance.. but man, 100k on a possibly erroneous private key? Think about it.

Best of luck with the product. Being a fan of art I do like what you guys are doing. It's a high stakes game so I hope your notes survive!

As a piece of art it's fantastic, but as a medium of cold storage it is relatively lousy, especially if generated through third parties. If the price goes up dramatically, youre gonna sweep the key on these asap. Still, it looks like a fun novelty for the short term..

Oof, thanks for the info!

Thanks for posting, I can't wait to try this.

I preordered end of June and got mines about two weeks ago, so I'd say it's definitely not a scam. 2017 preorders should have been the first ones out of the gate though..

That's all the proof we need, strong work!

I've done a dozen trades using zelle on bisq. I was skeptical at first, but it works and the transfers are instantaneous. Zelle transfers are not reversible contrary to whats been said, at least not with my bank..

If youre on Android, the Eclair wallet is great option without the comittment of running a node. You fund it, open up a payment channel, and pay your merchant. Youtube is your friend. Good luck!

something something sign the keys

I just enabled it, thanks for posting.. Did they even announce this?

This one's a classic and I always reference it when trying to explain bitcoin. It's perfect for getting technical-minded ppl up to speed with all the main buzz words that get thrown around when talking "crypto".

It's been great for me. I'm an ex coinbase user and compared to that, cash app was easier to get verified on and has way higher limits starting out. You get your bitcoin instantly for withdrawal to your personal wallets as well.. last but not least cash app deals only in bitcoin.

Probably the best takeaway from the article is referring to Faketoshi as "Craig Steven Fart Face"
@_date: 2019-01-07 21:19:31
Better if now.

I'd add Cash app and Gemini.
@_date: 2018-07-02 02:30:21
Afaik, you do need to be over 18 to use the app (as per the user agreement). Further, you'll need to submit a photo of your ID to withdraw bitcoin.

Just take this experience as a valuable lesson. You at least had the intuition of how to possibly counter it which is a more knowledge than most ppl have or care to learn. From here onward start taking control of those private keys!

What about frieza reaching one million power lvl?

Bitbox lead the way there for sure, but im glad ledger has finally caught up.
