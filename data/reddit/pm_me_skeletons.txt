The world is truly changing...
...because I bought more BTC yesterday and for some god knows why reason it went up instead of crashing to it's death!

We are witnessing history WHAT THE FUCK

I dump enough so if it ever gets to 1 million (or 100k in a more realistic bet), I'll make some okay money. But it's rising so fast, the temptation to put more rises too...

I'm getting scared. All I need is for it to reach 20k to I can cash out my initial investment. What happens next doesn't matter, as I will hodl to the moon. But with the way this is happening, I don't know what will happen boys...

It was me. I bought bitcoin for the first time some days ago, after checking it for quite a while and thinking "yep, it probably won't crash and stay below 7k"
Boy, I have no idea what I'm doing

My brother is pretty stupid, that's why I didn't heard him and got into this train

I WANT TO BUY MORE BUT IT NEVER FALLS WTF

I bought my first fraction of bitcoin (just a hundred bucks) some weeks ago at 7k. I always believed in it but didn't wanted to put huge amounts of money in it simply because of the risk involved (plus my brother, who is a lawyer, was trying to scare me out of it because legislations and shit). I didn't fret when it dropped to 5k, as I was sure it would rise again. I kept hodling and now I wish I had spent more than a hundred bucks!

First time I bought it dropped to 5600 minutes later. Can't wait for it to happen again...
