Did't a huge amount of investors and bankers just get busted in like several countries for artificially inflating the price of gold? 
Sadly there isn't enough gold to back the value of today's currencies. 
It'll be an interesting decade, how much higher will the US debt ceiling rise?

Source? That doesn't ring any sort of logical bells to me.
The security of BTC is the network, the people are the network, how is it costing 25$ to send a transaction? That's not a cost incurred by any one individual, that's for sure, are you implying electricity, server space, and miners costs are a factor? I strongly disagree that you can weight their costs on transaction costs.... That would be like the bank hiking my rates because their CEO's brother's cousin twice removed wants a new car.....illogical connection.

It's still early.
People think Bitcoin is the "answer"
But really it's just Cryptocurrency 1.0
It was made open source so people can improve on it, and make it better.
BTC is far too difficult for the average user in these subreddit to even comprehend. When they "dumb it down" for the level of the average internet user, it will stand a better chance of mass adoption, or use.

Free if you don't pay a txn fee for speedier confirmations.
Instant for the sender, delayed for receiver (confirmations) correct.
But there are other alt's with instant txn's. Potcoin (averages like 3-8 seconds for me.

I'm not speaking for Bitcoin... But these groups of "13 year olds" are actually the same people who work in Silicon Valley, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and the likes... You may see them as "13 year olds" and majority of the subredditdrama crew may think of them as "computer nerds" but when it comes to the job they do, you can't touch them with a 20' pole.
Online transactions today are not great. In fact their riddled with instances of fraud and overages in charges and fees. (SSL heart work bug) etc... 
Not to mention, limiting to who can receive, when, and where.
BTC transactions are instant, and free. That sounds good to me :-)
Their bank statements disagree with your assertions. 
Just saying :-) to each their own!
Edit: why all the downvoting? Nothing but truth.

I agree, the taxation of Bitcoin is ridiculous, but that comes from the pressure of big bankers having something to fear for the first time this century :-)
Hopefully things will change.

Worldcoin a BTC subsidiary raised money for wells in Africa.
There are coins like Potcoin being implemented in the legalized cannabis industry with a foundation to provide compassionate care for patients with terminal or severe disease who use cannabis as medicine.
Dogecoin sent 2 groups of athletes from two countries who couldn't afford to Olympics to Sochi (Jamaican and Indian?) there are plenty more examples. There are coins designed for the entire population of Iceland to use as a secondary, maybe even primary currency some day.
It's not fecious to think cryptocurrency (in current or different form) will replace, become, or facilitate real world transactions. We live in an ever increasing digital society, and Satoshi made currency transaction facilitation in a new dimension. I'm reminded of how people said the internet wouldn't never be a "thing" 20+ years ago. How the times have changed. History will tell.

I loved the conversion rate last time I was in Bali. 
Checking you bank balance in Rupiah is defiantly an ego booster.
Seeing Rp200,000,000 on the screen was something I'll never forget :-)

Right, I know what you mean now.
I've only heard of such things, never really read up on it, so thank you. 
I'm not holding BTC anyways, I have my eye on a few Alt's that do business better :-)

I think some bankers are catching on, that if they adopt the protocols and centralize a coin, they would have gold v2.0. Some are admitting the protocol just makes sense. :-) interesting times.

I was waiting for some other cultural stereotype to pop out!

I don't think the crypto community **is** advocating for no taxes, in fact we welcome BTC to be taxed as a currency, not as a commodity as some governments (US et al.) have done. You seem to be confused on that point.
My reference to the tech industry is that like it or not, technology is the future, as it always has been. You're using it to reply to me right now.
Therefore it's not facetious to think that down the road currency will exist as a digital currency, versus it's current existence. 
In fact majority of money in existence is in digital form already, just not one that is secure like BTC. And yes, the cryptographic algorithm of BTC is extremely secure, and has yet to be hacked (Mt. Gox etc are not from fault with BTC) what do you think mortgages and loans are? Digital money that you generally never hold in your hand, it's merely a representation of your "credit".
Money in our economy isn't as stable as you people like to believe it is. Facts are that the debt is crushing the economy and it's barely floating above collapse. Money is debt, or money owed back to the reserves. 
Bitcoin is not debt, it's minting procedure is the revolutionary change in looking at currency.
Don't fear, people cried witchcraft when the internet was announced too. Don't fall too far behind now.

It's a keyword, for organic sales

The t-shirt is good quality, but by placing premium in the title - I get more organic search results - overall.

Read it for yourself ... 
What did I say, in your limited opinion, is incorrect?
Also, not religious, that made no sense.
Try and keep up.

[...Did you read his indictment?](
YES, because he was indicted via Grand Jury. 
Grand Juries are provided the evidence, and decide if it warrants indictment or not, they saw this evidence, and indicted Assange. Therefore one can conclude, yes there is plenty of evidence - you'll see this at trial now.

This is making me re-think if I want to be part of this sub/community.
This man is not a journalist, a free-speech hero, or even a likeable guy - let alone representing the Bitcoin community in any respect, he's a criminal, who was caught trying to crack passwords to a classified DOD database.... **READ. HIS. INDICTMENT.**

Prove they're lies, and we'll talk.
Until then, good luck.

Well there's the time he released hacked democratic materials, but purposefully withheld the hacked GOP materials (yes, they were hacked as well) and also held back a trove of Russian documents (hmm, wonder why?). Wikileaks as you knew it, died a long time ago, now it's a Russian disinfo. operation, hence the charges under the espionage act. He was trying to aid Chelsea manning in cracking a government database password she illegally obtained. This goes WELL beyond "journalism". If you support those actions, I question your loyalties to your country.

What kind of response is that?
I provided you factual information, feel free to evaluate that at your earliest convenience. And this is your well-thought out counter-reply?
Well done.
