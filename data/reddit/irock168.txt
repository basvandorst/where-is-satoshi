The thing with that is that I already bought a tiny bit more bitcoins on coinbase to boost my earnings by a couple cents and they sill haven't arrived. So wait until they get here and hopefully get more than what I can get today or cash what I have now and later, cash that too?

I verified a debit card a while ago.....It actually went all the way through the verification process but I don't see it as a payment option when I go to buy or sell coins, is that why it's still in beta?

so I can't use my CC if I have a verified bank account? *sad face*

Well this morning I was trying to just make $200 more than what I invested so I would guess quick buck
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:26:09
It's safe to assume that it's past $800 by now, even if coinbase is down
