Everybody thinks MT. Gox prices are wrong but the truth is that Mt. Gox prices are right.
Why did the rest of the market crash in sympathy when all those Bitcoins got trapped in Mt. Gox? Because this whole market was over valued bubble, that's why.
If I lose my bitcoin wallet then every other bitcoin goes up in value. To consider a market that crashes after Mt. Gox loses a fortune of Bitcoins... why else did the price fall? The market is a hoax.
When Mt. Gox re-opens and those bitcoins flee into the market, the price will drop again because there is simply no ground to stand on.
Bitcoin is Quitcoin and don't buy until after it has an even worse name than that one!!! Hold your cash back! USD Rules!

I heard you never had so much wealth so you handled it poorly because you don't know the how to's and the proper ways to liquidate into such a large amount of the real money called United States Dollars.
So now I learned this fun fact: If I ever have sex with Jennifer Aniston there would be no way I could possibly do it right according to the standards of everybody else who never had sex with Jennifer Aniston.

So, who is the cash in transit service that buys bitcoins from the atm owner? Say what? Never mind.
How rich to be placed in the dead center of the homeless veterans that are going to freeze to death this winter. 
Don't worry about that. You have bitcoins to sell so there will be money to pay for Hal Finney's refrigeration bill for the next four or five hundred years.
