If it is really the Bitcoin niche, then we have to worry.
With the current mining centralisation "censorship resistance" rely on trust.
@_date: 2016-08-22 13:01:30


Fungibility has nothing to do with regulations. It is a fundamental property of money.
It mean 1BTC=1BTC.


They already do and have done for decades...
The accept cash.
You seem to imply anonymity is only good for criminal.
Criminal already know how to "anonymize" BTC..
That mean only the less skilled criminal are easy to track with Bitcoin and it doesn't prevent any criminal use.
(FYI monero account can be audited by publishing a view key.. So much for a criminal currency..)
@_date: 2016-08-11 06:41:04
Remove any arbitrary limit, ensure the most ASIC resistant mining.
@_date: 2016-08-15 10:09:30
Well if you still it be careful how you spend.. Don't forget the owner can follow the money on chain
@_date: 2016-08-17 09:15:30
Not if it use merge mining, then it would have the same hash power backing it.
@_date: 2016-08-24 13:49:31
It all depend how you value your money.
If it is a complete no go that you have no light client and prefer the risk of fungibilty lost on some of your holding then that fine, it is your choice but it is not mine.
It is also trival to connect a monero lite client to your node any other option present some privacy/trust issue.

Very interesting project:
Decentralised internet, possibly a blockchainless cryptocurrency!
I've tried and have been plaisantly surprised it is actually faster then I thought!
As it is not collecting the website data for a server but from crypted chunk spread among node around the network somehow I expected it to be slow..

Yes and it is unclear if it is possible to make any light clients..
That's an issue with Monero indeed.
@_date: 2016-08-22 16:10:30
Yes you can, just found out which address he used,
@_date: 2016-08-24 08:29:09
Well use Bitsquare (it run trought Tor by default) I don't know if it is safe for such use tough,
Trustless exchange is not a problem since multisig existed.
Actually when Monero get multisig it will be easy to build trustless exchange to exchange direct XMR to any cryptocurrency or direct FIAT (that I would recommand.. But it would be possible..)
@_date: 2016-08-22 16:47:33


It will great when Bitcoin will have HD address implemented.. It's about time..
@_date: 2016-08-24 08:20:53
Well with BTC you are mixing you are taking action to hide your coin history.
That action "can" make you suspicious.
@_date: 2016-08-22 11:33:58


@_date: 2016-08-22 16:09:23


It is true, monero is a fork away from bytecoin.
I failed to see why it is a problem, now the code base and project is radically different.
@_date: 2016-08-01 21:05:06


Seriously according to you mining is not centralisated now?
We don't have the same definition of centralisation then..
@_date: 2016-08-22 17:52:32
At least with HD a new address will be used for each payment am I wrong?
@_date: 2016-08-22 16:06:48
Monero offer optional transparency via view key.
Transparency is great, anonymity is great they both have their use case.
@_date: 2016-08-22 11:33:19
Why it is better suited for crime?
Fungibilty is essential to a currency.

@_date: 2016-08-24 08:23:07
Bitsquare is the way to go I think,
@_date: 2016-08-16 07:29:39
Well in the case of LN lot of complexity will be apparent to end user..
Setting up your channel, can't empty your channel without closing it, different fees (onchain fees, LN fees), locktime..
This can't be hidden away.
(And I kinda disagree bitcoin in principle is fearly simple, it is a different story with LN)
@_date: 2016-08-26 08:46:44
**please make that post a sticky!!**
@_date: 2016-08-24 15:23:47
I don't know exactly, Monero is fundamentals different than bitcoin.
For example your need view key + spend key to know your balance.
The issue is with those two keys you can also spend the balance, so I guess using a lite client on monero is like if using a lite client with bitcoin require to share the private key.. not good,
But I am not sure, it would be better if someone more knowledgeable can reply..
@_date: 2016-08-11 07:48:43
The idea is to keep every player independant and let the market decide.
The complete opposite of now,
Where a handful of people control the network and take advantage of that to push radical economic change on it.
This situation (centralisation) has **always** lead to majestic failures (FIAT).. only decentralised system are sustainable (gold..)


Can you elaborate what was idiotic from him?
@_date: 2016-08-22 11:43:33


Can you give an example?
@_date: 2016-08-12 11:20:19
Only the market know who is ignorant or not.
The only way to keep the economic parameters stable is with decentralisation and independent participants..
Somethings Bitcoin has lost,
The proof is actually the economic parameters are bieng changed in a massive way.
If anything Bitcoin has been rather easy to change..
@_date: 2016-08-15 16:17:22


Finding the path once you knows the whole network topology is not difficult.
The challenge is getting enough information about the network (constantly changing) to be able to find a path without relying on a third party.
Knowing the all network topology = possible to find a path without relying on any third party.
But that mean each node has to "communicate" their status (liquidity, fee, neighbors) each time a payment need routing on the network.
*it the same scaling characteristics of onchain transactions, each new transactions is one more transactions to process for the whole network*
Reduced knowledge of the network = you need to connect to a node that has more knowledge of the network topology and process the routing for you. (Masternodes)
*this has much better scaling characteristics but introduce some centralisation and trust with the obvious problems involved with it*
@_date: 2016-04-15 05:52:01


How you pay for mining?
@_date: 2016-08-22 11:31:40


That I had no idea,
Sneaky indeed.
How can you force company to do no address re-use?
@_date: 2016-08-15 10:06:46
Decentralised Routing is a very difficult task.
It can very well got same poor scaling characteristics that onchain scaling.
If 100% trusless your node need to know the whole network topology to compute a route itself each time a payment need routing, this has very bad scaling characteristics..
It seems can be improved with some level of centralisation  (masternodes).
@_date: 2016-08-16 07:36:23


True I didn't think about the fact that some payments might simply be impossible to process.
IMO the issue is LN was well suited for micro payment and forcing to scale to whole network will simply not work.


One simulation was performed and lead to all payments concentrating on few nodes. (I will try to find the link)
@_date: 2016-04-20 10:17:41


I agree then the successful fork will the one choosen by the community and not because a selected elite decided so.
@_date: 2016-08-24 08:14:41


The proper term is "taint"
Monero has no taint.


Unspend output are mixed and send to stealth address.
There is an historic but it is made unreadable unless you have a "view key"
Then the blockchain get transparent for one specific address (or transactions).


True there is some edge case when traceability is possible, AFAIK this should be fixed by ringCT.


It is not perfect and no cryptocurrency and anonymity system nowadays is.
But Monero aim to be most fungibile/private cryptocurrency there is.


Good luck to trace transactions without view key (:
@_date: 2016-08-22 11:35:25
This is likely what will happen,
All new technology go trough that phase anyway...

@_date: 2016-04-09 13:08:35
So what your are saying is that the number of node don't matter in the network?
So node decentralisation doesn't matter?
And what about the non-upgraded that cannot upgrades because bla-blah big block, when it get transactions it cannot validate?
Why validate any transactions then?
@_date: 2016-08-15 09:52:21


Well how that make increasing complexity even more acceptable?
@_date: 2016-04-19 06:21:11
Well then you might be better reducing your investment in Bitcoin,
Because there no guarantee Bitcoin can be own an managed by one team with zero risk of being forked.
Personally I am glad for that.
This ultimately protect bitcoin from being taken over.
@_date: 2016-04-08 14:48:47
Great to hear that.
Bravo BTCC!
@_date: 2016-04-06 20:01:22
It sound odd to me, why anyone route your payment without collecting a fee?
@_date: 2016-04-03 06:10:34
What about non updated node when segwit will be deployed?
How is it ok that a large number of node in the network will not be albe to verify tx signatures?
What if a large fraction of node doesn't upgrade?
The real number of fully validating node will always stay much lower than now.
@_date: 2016-04-12 18:17:08

@_date: 2016-04-20 06:27:35
Why? Classic on top of segwit would give 2x more capacity,
@_date: 2016-04-20 13:24:08
Well it took them some time to realize that a permissionned block chain don't make sense.
@_date: 2016-04-07 05:05:14


How come?
Locking coin in a channel got a cost: it expose you to volatility.
If anything people will likely lock as little coin as possible in n a channel.
@_date: 2016-04-09 12:48:36


Why fork away?
Core can patch their code and follow nobody is excluded..
@_date: 2016-04-30 18:27:00


Only if you know the spend and view key,
But it's the equivalent of knowing a private key in bitcoin, so obviously with those two keys you will know everything and even being able to spend the Moneroj...
Edit clarity.
@_date: 2016-04-20 09:55:08
Hahaa thanks, you seems to be very knowledgeable on the subject!!
@_date: 2016-04-16 07:53:13


Yes it is a possibly, another is that the 2nd compete with the main chain for fee.
As fee will be high on the chain the ultimate result will be avoiding settling onchain to reduce cost.
The main chain cannot compete by processing more Tx (therefore lowering the per-tx cost)
The only solution I can think of to get out of this trap will be to increase the block reward so mining can get funding again.
This will kill the store of value properties of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-16 06:57:05


Time unlimited payment channel..
That sounds crazy.. Then there no need to settle on chain anymore?
How come the mining get funding that way?
@_date: 2016-04-20 06:51:25
You assume LN come with zero trade off, I guess.
@_date: 2016-04-26 14:38:50
Bitcoin is not fungibile.
Fungility mean that it is impossible to distinguish two different unit of a currency.
The "coin" in Bitcoin have different history clearly available in the blockchain, therefore two different coin can be distinguished.
@_date: 2016-04-26 14:35:32
People use coinjoin for a reason,
Even if coinjoin is good to hide coin history you can still end up with tainted coin.
Unless mixing is enforced at the protocol level, fungibility is not fixed.
@_date: 2016-04-09 12:50:48
Because a segwit tx will have less full validating node.
Unless validating signatures is useless this is degradation of the system.

Well, I would say Bitcoin is *trying* to solve that problem.. So far unless the system recover some mining decentralisation, It's a bit soon to say that it is solved yet..
@_date: 2016-04-09 11:52:55


Woow that's one pretentious claim!
Remember Bitcoin is still an experiment also..
@_date: 2016-04-20 12:17:48
Nothing wrong about that, it's just the way it was mean to be.
It has only become a probleme because now mining is centralised. (Because it would take two-three person to get that 50%+)
@_date: 2016-04-11 09:21:15


Not if it fail due to scaling off-chain. (but to not enough funding for mining)
@_date: 2016-04-20 04:18:04
Well repeating lies doesn't make it true,
I see you unable to provide link supporting your claim.
@_date: 2016-08-25 13:45:54
It should be good to make a sticky post to remind everyone that.
@_date: 2016-04-09 12:46:53
So SPAM: low fee transactions?
@_date: 2016-04-10 13:49:04
* Non upgraded - These users do not upgrade, perhaps because they do not have capacity for blocks over 1MB.  However, **these nodes still fully validate all incoming transactions and there is no reduction in security.**  
Can you elaborate how an old not can validate a segwit Tx without the witness data?


Old node get all tx, segwit an non-segwit.
They are tricked to believe the segwit tx are valid even if they have no access to the whiteness data.
It will be likely better to wait few more confirmations before spending those tx.
@_date: 2016-04-20 13:55:49
Ok then define dead.
Classic can very well stay with little support, if a big capacity crisis arise during the halving or whatever other event, it is still available, ready to activate.
If you are right (it seems to be very important for you being right) classic is is irrelevant and will never activate, so why do you even care?
Why are you somehow scared of classic?
@_date: 2016-04-21 07:45:30
I am just asking a link to your claim that classic dev want full control over Bitcoin.
If you cannot back up your claim, you are spreading FUD.
@_date: 2016-04-14 04:42:42
Why being agressive?
@_date: 2016-04-19 06:59:19


The project aim to add capacity on the main chain rather odd way to kill Bitcoin.


Classic double the capacity on chain, Bitcoin core would simply add to add a patch to be compatible. Nobody is being kicked out. I am not sure you understand what a fork is.
Bitcoin code was meant to be upgraded by hard fork and soft fork. 
Just regular process.
It's painful but it's the price to pay for not being in centrally planned and central own software.


What is shady the proposal is all in the open.
And great scaling feature as already beeng added to some alternative implementation.
Edit typos 
@_date: 2016-04-12 07:47:06
Who knows?
In 5 years time, say all the Bitcoin economy moved to a second layer network, then no amount of space restrictions can guarantee enough revenue for miner.
If fees are too high on chain people will naturally tend to keep their channel open as long as possible.
Then suddenly some internet forum start to "influence" opinion by deleting and banning people defending the coin cap.. Because it's for the good of Bitcoin! And anyway who care a white paper written 13 years ago,
And people will find any convoluted argument:
"Satoshi is not relevant anymore"
"Satoshi never said how mining will get funded when the block reward get negligible"
"Bitcoin is incomplete and broken obviously fees will never be enough to support the network"
"Early adopters are selfish they don't want to share the Bitcoin infrastructure cost"
"Inflation is good"
Etc, etc,
Many smart people will claim they know what best for bitcoin and user have no say anyway..
Could even be a core proposal "BIP513: proposal for increase on chain mining funding"
After all the miner supported core against the XT and classic forks, now they might ask to return the favor!
And with the current mining centralisation with like 10 peoples in charge of 90% of the network hash rate and not be surprised one day to get the news: 
We have fund consensus at the last changai meeting with the core dev and we will support bip513.
Therefore the next halving will not be applied to Bitcoin, update your node or you will be forked off.
How is that more irrealistic than using the block limit as an economic regulation tool?
It's just need a bit of *coordination* how fortunate they know each other well.
@_date: 2016-04-08 18:30:18

Unless your counterpart is uncooperative then you cannot move your fund anymore for certain amount of time.
This case doesn't exist on the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-04-27 05:42:11
It would be great if it was enough to provide fungility.
Unfortunately it is not.
If you make a payment using one tainted output (for example an output coming from an address known to be linked to illegal activities) the "coin" the receiver will get will be tainted too.
Reproduce this method every time a payment is made and you can build up an history hurting the value of that coin compare to a clean, fresh coin.
If you want to known what it takes to make a fungible currency look at ring signature and monero and you will have a sense of how much effort and complexity you have to go trought to hide a coin history at the protocol level.

@_date: 2016-04-16 06:29:46


Well you just said it the only reason to close your channel if your counterpart is unresponsive.. This will seriously reduce the use of the blockchain..
Then as more people use LN you will have more and more incentive to have channel open with a very long expiration date.. Specially if fees on the main chain are high and block space saturated.. And if channel could stay open indefinitely.. How the miner can collect enough fees?
I have been told on this subreddit that ultimately the main chain will only be used for the added security of paper wallet, everything including exchange will use LN channel!
This would be catastrophic.. There no way the use from the occasional paper wallet transactions can pay enough to the miner even with wide spread adoption..
The vision of "restricted blockchain and everything on a second layer" simply don't work!
@_date: 2016-04-13 13:42:51


Potentially this is an attack vector, if you can temporarily rent enough hash power to activate a feature...but that's a flaw with the activation method. 
Well that's a flaw of any blockchain as long as you get 51% hash power you get to decide what get in..
Because you will be guaranteed to build the chain with the most PoW.
@_date: 2016-04-11 13:46:54
More likely miner decide to increase the block reward..
They know each other well know.
What can be done again 90%+ of the hash rate.
I would not be surprised it get support after all nobody would have believed few years ago that the 1MB will be maintained.
@_date: 2016-04-13 16:41:22
Because of it's avatar?
Well no comment...
@_date: 2016-04-21 20:20:45
My point of view is:
Don't let the system run out of capacity. Keep it working. Implement 2nd layer scaling when tested and mature. make compromise.
Let those scaling solutions compete with each other and let the market decide which one it will adoption.
Implement all scaling solution.
Don't change bitcoin fundamentals economics and incentives.
I let you judge if they are insincere.

@_date: 2016-04-19 14:08:49


No, Gavin repeatedly said that he doesn't want to be in charge of Bitcoin.
None of the classic dev has acted as they want complete control over Bitcoin.
Can you give a link supporting this claim.


Misconceptions again, 
Once the fork activate Bitcoin just need a quick patch to be compatible.
It would be the most ineffective take over ever.


Well they support different point of view as yours. No need take as a personal attack.


Fail to understand a link between classic and get-rich-quick.


There is no classic coin.
It's a hard fork proposal to increase capacity of the blockchain, the goal is to keep one chain, not split apart.
Another proposal is pushing forward a PoW change (Satoshi's Bitcoin it's called I believe) this one will be creating a separate chain.


No classic is not about splitting, it's about increase the capacity of the main chain with an hard fork period.
If the fork activate Bitcoin core just need a quick patch to be compatible with.
You may disagree with it, fair enough, but that's the way it is.
That's the way open source project evolve, painfully.
But it's a superior alternative to centrally planned currency (IMO).


There cannot be any take over.
Nobody "own" Bitcoin.

Bip101 died because the classic proposal was put forward.
All alternative implementation stopped supporting XT and supported classic scaling road map instead, does it make more sense?


Can you elaborate, I fail to see any cognitive dissonance here?
I am happy, Ultimately soft fork segwit is on chain scaling are you sure the cognitive dissonance is not on your side?
I guess you thought the fight was segwit against classic somehow.


Forget sides, forget about being right and wrong.
Everybody support support segwit only the soft fork implementation was subject of discussion.
But nobody said it has to be segwit or classic,




I was indeed wrong, and sold 3/4 of all my coins, the problem was not so much the scaling issue but the centralisation of power in bitcoin.
One dev team took on its own to change fundamentals, economics and incentives without community consensus is a big red flag for me.
Recipes for deseaster.. Bitcoin was meant to make that kind of thing impossible.


How you define dead?
If anything segwit just gave classic 2 time more impact. (3.5 equivalent block size).
And there is adaptative block size on the classic road map, I fail to see why suddenly it would be dead when a soft planned several months get a PR.

And that my main issue with LN,
It would not be volontary with limited block space, I will be priced out of the blockchain and I will have to use it if I want to use Bitcoin.
Rather scary prospect.
Edit typos 
@_date: 2016-04-09 11:58:54
Then their nodes will not be validating segwit transactions...
That mean from the point of view of a segwit user the network will have much less full validating nodes therefore the network will be much more centralised...

Any chance you got a link?

No, volatility was not an issue, I have bought back the bitcoin I sold as soon as the deal was made with localbitcoin, so I only add to pay the fee form the exchange and localbitcoin,
The gain come from the fact that it is hard to get Bitcoin in Norway.. I ve been told I could have charged more.


Well I had few bank account and I never ever had a fair exchange rate, what is DKB?


Well still less convenient than an ATM..

Not a satisfying answer.
With this setup in place it is possible to have wide adoption **and falling hash rate**.

Coinjoin don't fix fungility..
You mix your bitcoin with other Bitcoin.
The Bitcoin you end with have an history too, therefore still not fungible.
In practice you are likely to end up with tainted coins.

No both system should coexist.
But with unlimited time LN channel I fail to see how the mining will ever be able to collect enough funding.. The blockchain fee become an avoidable expense,

I am not happy because it would have been better implemented as an hard fork.
And that would not have been "contentious" ,whatever that mean, if core had supported it.
Can you elaborate on what is the next one?
Why it would not be contentious later?
@_date: 2016-04-10 07:27:43
I support hard fork to increase capacity as it was intended from the beginning.

Memory hard PoW should be enough because any ASIC would have to be equipped with very fast memory..
Those will in turn be used on computer so the performance gap should stay "under control" and no ASIC will ever be able to outcompete CPU by millions or billions times,
This is good enough,
@_date: 2015-12-17 11:00:18
In 10 years horizon bitcoin will only be a good store of value if the network find an equilibrium with almost no more block reward.
In the next ten years bitcoin will experience 3 halving.

I am actually trying to find some reading on that, because it's actually hard to understand why bitcoin has not been invented before.. All elements existed!
@_date: 2015-12-08 10:10:49
Is it correct if I say:
With segwit only the Tx data will be within the block limit and the segregated data will be transited "out" of it.
So more Tx can fit a block because the signature data are not included?
@_date: 2015-06-17 22:15:53
Damned what that could be when he take a shit...
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:20:56
I am not sure I get your comment, 
We would get the 20MB with this proposal but only when needed.
@_date: 2015-12-05 07:58:26
Good luck to make run LN on 1MB...
That would mean we will have to move all/most of our bitcoin holding in a "hot wallet"..
Who does that??

@_date: 2015-12-29 19:25:54
Well with segwit the signature data will already be out the block limit.
That would lead to 2x maybe 3x improvement on TPS so where the remaining improvement you say come from?

economics is always happening, and should be expected. Worse, intervening in consensus changes would make the ecosystem more dependent on the group taking that decision, not less.

And Greg Maxwell promised an equivalent 4MB at worst..
@_date: 2015-12-25 21:50:18
This would be an interesting way to test the network.
Asking miner to not produce any block bigger than 500kb for a fews days (a week?) would be a great way to collect real data on how the network react.
I guess they likely cooperate,
(Well you just need most them to cooperate to simulate a restricted capacity)
I think It's a good idea.
The more data, the more test the better.

@_date: 2015-12-05 08:27:22
You argue that you have to take the worst case scenario when it come to big block (you can't handle 8GB blocks bitcoin is dead) and you take ridiculously high assumptions when arguing for LN (100 000$ per coin)...
@_date: 2015-12-08 10:35:39
Ok I just tell how I understand it I might be wrong,
Fully validating node download Tx data (that will limited to 1MB) and the segwit data separately.
Non-validating node/ lite client will download only the Block (Tx data)
It's a way to go around the block limit, fully validating node will have more data to download (to my understanding there is no scaling effect.. I must misunderstand something..)
@_date: 2015-12-02 06:29:00

This only show there have been vote manipulation, it says nothing about which side did the manipulation.
Vote manipulation can come from large block supporter as well as small block supporter.

I would be curious how the 'lock money' parts of it work..
Does it will automatically lock say 3x the money you pay first?

I think Satoshi create the blockchain to be as open as possible.
Lot of value can derive from that.
@_date: 2015-12-24 16:03:49


It is what you say no data show correlation.
There no fix to mining centralisation, Hashing sha256 is very ASIC friendly.
Electricity is cheap in china, manufacturing capacity are beyond any other country.
Those two factors give a competitive advantage to China that cannot be overcome period. 
Any crypto that use ASIC-friendly PoW will end up with the majority of hash rate in China.
What is disingenuous?
Mining is not centralised? development is not centralised? forum are censored?
@_date: 2015-12-05 14:32:35


I cannot agree more and I wished I could upvote more.. :)
Bitcoin is beautifully self-regulating and regulatory resistant and many are putting back the very thing we a trying to avoid so hard.
I wished bitcoin core publish their vision about the future of bitcoin so we would all know where it is going and (as bitcoin should alway as been = a voluntary system) let us the choice to follow us or not...
And when I look at the LN white paper you see that you will need quite a few third party to make it trustless (and I would argue some of them are trusted third party because if they screw-up you bitcoin can be stolen)
Bitcoin is becoming more and more complex 2 layers things with LN, side-chain and tree-chain....none of them are no way near ready... And leave strong doubt on how mining will get financed... It's getting too far of the original idea IMHO.
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:52:16
As argued by Mike Hearn,
If Bitcoin run out of capacity, it will start to be unreliable and people will resend their transaction further increasing the problem..
Delays will be unpredictable and transactions will be lost...
Bitcoin has not been design to properly run when out of capacity.
Confidence on the system will be lost and it will take long long time to recover form it.
It not a good idea to make it "hit the wall on purpose"
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:52:00

Great point!
@_date: 2015-12-05 08:22:46


What make you think bitcoin cannot be even more centralized on 10MB if the whole Bitcoin economy on a second layer?
People will have even less of an incentive to run a node (no matter how cheap) and most if not all the fee income will move to the second layer too!
Who will run a mining operation when running a LN node will need much less investment to start with??
@_date: 2015-06-25 12:47:48
Does it mean that the overwhelming majority of mode in the network are non-mining full node?
@_date: 2015-12-19 19:44:58


What was that? A soft increase? Link?


NO, because your pen and paper cannot simulate the whole network behavior. 
What you have proven is that there is some centralisation pressure, 
Ok but if Bitcoin experience significant growth with BIP202 the number of nodes might very well increase.. There is no way to be sure but to get *real* data! 
@_date: 2015-12-04 11:09:55


That say a lot indeed!

In your case the attacker has to purchase the major part of the hashing power production. (in secret)
That has to be more at least a lot more than 50% of the production available. (otherwise the time it take to reach 50% will be too long)
Wait until it get **as much hashing power** as all network got. (and a little bit more.. so it will get 51% of the worldwide available)
Then pay an energy bill equivalent to the **all** bitcoin network for 14days and then voila! you have successfully reduced the block size limit to zero, but then have destroy Bitcoin so what's the point of block size anymore?
I agree 14 million dollar lost of Bitcoin is negligible at that point.
Again nothing new 51% attack = bad
But I think it would be very hard to pull off such an attack even for gorverment so "any adversary, intel, JP morgan" No way!
@_date: 2015-12-01 20:17:35

Why don't you post the admin message then?
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:41:28
I do argue that is enough for a fee market and we don't need to "force it" only the miner should.
Specially as the fees are getting a potentially much bigger part of their income. 
halving coming=less reward... bigger block=more Tx
The incentive to collect fees can be 40x bigger!! (2x less rewards + 20x more space)
The fee incentive is just negligible now.. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 09:21:28
I get your point of view and agree mostly with it,
The only thing I am uncomfortable with if it's again unproven software, so now we need to wait segwit and LN to be as good as expected to start scaling..
And the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) solution is delayed again.. And we will stick with 1MB waiting for those miracle scaling software to kick in.. Hoping they come out as good as advised..
@_date: 2015-12-02 09:47:23

@_date: 2015-06-16 13:57:11


Miner can refuse to include Tx with low fees.
Let's say you don't include the smallest fees Tx and by doing that you just lost 0,08BTC but your block is 3x smaller than the current average then maybe it's a small price to pay to protect your block from being orphaned,
@_date: 2015-12-17 14:13:52
I second that!
@_date: 2015-12-18 09:05:57


Sidechains and payment channe are possible **because** Satoshi wanted it as open as possible from the beginning.


I am not treating him as a god, sorry Satoshi is relevant to bitcoin.


You refer to him too.


Without feature "set in stone forever" bitcoin would not exist.
It is actually the great breakthrough from the blockchain, now thing can be "set in stone" digitally.

@_date: 2015-06-18 21:07:56
I think adoption can be high and usage still low,
As some say "good money chase bad money"
It mean that you will always prefer speeding your worst kind of money first and you prefer keeping your best. (bitcoin)
For exemple when coin where made out of gold, people always spend the coin that look like they where fake and kept the good one! good money chase bad money.. So I think bitcoin will be a lot more adopted but no crazy increase in bitcoin usage as long as people can get rid of fiat first..
@_date: 2015-12-29 09:58:24
Indeed the current mining centralisation in China suggest that China can without too much difficulty stop Bitcoin.

 &gt;The problem is we will likely not be able to get enough improvements to scale at the rate BIP101 increases unless some new sort of optimization method is discovered, I don't think we should be risking Bitcoin's future decentralization on something that doesn't yet exist.

Sorry but the biggest change to Bitcoin would be let the block size limit to 1MB.. 
Expensive fees, transaction confirmation getting unpredictable with the hope that some (not yet READY) lightning network, sidechain will save the day..
In that case bitcoin will become a very different beast indeed..
Far from the bitcoin promise I have believed on..
I would certainly feel betrayed...
I actually stopped talking of bitcoin to people.. because.. I don't know what bitcoin will be.. 
How can I explain to people "go for that high fees electronic payment system" ...

The only way to pay the miner are either mining fee and block reward..
If "2-layer bitcoin network" cannot provide enough mining fee to secure the network there will no other solution than increase the block reward.
By going this we might put at risk the 21 million cap...

Yes that a good thing miner will have to balance the risk between fee income and risk.
This  is what you need to create a fee market.

@_date: 2015-06-28 09:35:38
I agree with what you say.
And bitcoin will still be far superior that bank even with high fees, without any doubts.
There where still be a use for bitcoin with 1$/ 10$ or even 100$ per transaction as a fast reliable and international transfer of money.
(but user case will grow ever smaller for every increase in fees)
But my issue is when I first discover bitcoin one of the main argument  has always been "little to no fees electronic cash system" and I buy in with that in mind and less that a year after it's now seriously question to change it.
And in a rather... rock'n roll way!! let's hit the wall and the market will somehow find a solution?!?.. scary..
Stability was suppose to be another main quality also... With that radical change that is going away too..
So that's why I can't honestly advice bitcoin to anyone now.. before I guess next year.. when there will be more clarity on what bitcoin will be... 
@_date: 2015-06-01 18:34:59
I get what you say,
But fees can be lower if more people have access to the blockchain..
And some alt-coin can be a valuable option, look monero:
* dynamic blocksize.
* per block difficulty adjustment.
* anonymity. (opaque blockchain)
@_date: 2015-06-02 18:58:02
I don't quite understand how the market is suppose to find a solution..

Why down vote? Sorry but it is true, we simply cannot talk about bitcoin as a 'no fee' system as long as people are pushing to increase the fee..
I certainly stopped to advice people to get into bitcoin, as long as I cannot know what bitcoin will be,

I would certainly fell bethreaded if bitcoin go away from it's initial promise..

@_date: 2015-06-28 19:59:26
Do you realise that your are talking about block being 10 000 times bigger??
Shouldn't we be working about bitcoin being 10x or 100x bigger before?
Don't you think there are intermediate steps between block being 800KB and 8GB blocks?
(And I assume you know that 8GB block size limit don't mean 8GB blocks... 8GB blocks are decades away at best... )
@_date: 2015-06-17 13:21:08
Simple is good,
It is consensus code here it's critical that's it is **100% reliable.**
Intel cannot build ASIC without **cutting down** is curent cpu production. Do you think they have factory waiting ready to produce ASIC "just in case".
 All their production facility are used.. well to produce CPU.
This would come with at **massive cost** for them (revenu lost) and it would not go unnoticed. 
And again they will have to produce as least as much as hashing power as the all bitcoin network in a raisonnable amount of time.

What make you think the fee will stay at 0.08$?
Network load is seasonal, if the average fees is 0.08$ during the year what about christmas time?

Miner don't have to collude.
Each miner take Tx fees they found appropriate and the associated reward, and that's it you need nothing else to create a fee market.
Today the miner rely on coinbase reward for income.. but after the halving potential reward from fees will double, and if we go to 20MB the potential reward will be **40x** you can be sure miner will look **a lot** more closely to the fees in the future,
No need to artificialy create a fee market, it is already there!

Well.. Wasn't a hard fork to increase the limit supposed to be faster??
It was the argument against Gavin.. "We don't need an hard fork now.. There is still capacity available if needed an hard fork can be pushed in matter of days"
So now soft suddenly is faster?

Sure, but it thats a rather inefficient attack.. has the block size will return to normal unless the attack is maintain continuously..

My friend thought the limited supply of bitcoin was dangerous not bitcoin by itself as an asset.
And it is a risky asset for sure.


I don't think there any idea behind FIAT currency, it is the system we've got and all the investment trick are way people have found to deal with it's inflationary nature.
I would way prefer a currency that would be a long term store of value and then you would not have to invest out of necessity to maintain your wealth..

Great point!
Just one things I am trying to understand, miner are critical to decide the hard fork.
Aren't the node too?
What would happen if 90% of the full reject the fork? Is 10% of full node enough to sustain the network until the fork will be resolved?
(ok that's an extreme case but It help me understand)

Forcing a system into overload.. And hoping that it will give incentive to alternate solution..
It's quite scary to see that idea being pushed by core-dev..  even for a non-expert like me.. It's obvious thats a bad idea..
A financial system bitcoin need stability.. If bitcoin get unstable.. unreliable for a month or even a week this will be something that will be remembered for years and slow back mainstream adoption of any cryptocurrency....
@_date: 2015-06-28 09:53:26
Sure.. but bitcoin is a financial system, it needs clarity of view, predictability, stability if it wants to succeed.
If bitcoin fail to his promise, well that would not even make the news, but a great opportunity would have been missed....

True it's unlikely he didn't know exactly how segwit will scale..
That make me seriously doubtful when he say "segwit can be roll out quickly"
@_date: 2015-12-05 14:38:24


This doesn't work that way, To use LN you are basically putting your coin in a hot wallet.. To scale at 7Billions with 100MB it is the ideal case with everybody putting all their coin in a hot wall and almost never return to the main chain.
Who would do that?
To work on 1MB people would have to settle as little as possible because settling in the main take more data than simple Tx.. unless people collect enough Tx on Lightining network before settling on the main chain you will bloat the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-12-25 15:37:41

And that a good thing.
Miner will have to choose between risk (get orphaned) or reward transaction fees.
It is what you need to create a fee **market.**
(fee will be potentially 40x more in proportion by next year due to the halfing and -if we do it- the increase in block size)
@_date: 2015-06-03 08:53:02
Sure the market can find solution if the fees a slowly increasing so it can get the "proper" signal, like you would expect with 20MB.
But with 1MB blocks.. the market can breakdown.. unless an alternative solution is already available and working.. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 11:19:26
Sorry if the question is stupid but how can we be sure the coin will move from the main chain to the side chain with a 1 to 1 ratio?
@_date: 2015-06-02 09:39:14
Yes and that is the risk of a 20MB to get orphaned compared to a 1MB block...
But if miner produce similar sized block they will all have the same disadvantage..

Miner will collude if they need more income from fees,
Because they will have a commun interest and that is what you see in a free market,

@_date: 2015-06-26 17:57:48
Yes, but how can you be sure to not end up with some kind of fractional banking?
With a sidechain tricking you by selling you bitcoin that will be seen as (for example) a quarter of a real bitcoin by the main chain?
By any chance have you got a link that ELI5 sidechain, all I could found on internet was .. well too complex..   
@_date: 2015-06-26 12:04:46
So I struggle to see the benefit of sidechain,
Sidechain are basically alt-coin.
I fail to see what is the advantage of that?

I cannot agree more!
@_date: 2015-06-02 09:42:52
The risk to get orphaned if you publish a 20MB is the same as if you publish a 1MB as long as you everybody publish block with the same size?
(same disadvantage for all?)
Am I wrong?

@_date: 2015-06-06 18:44:29
Ok, but would that mean the money is really lock the whole time? if I needed the money lock in the channel have I to wait the channel to expire?
let's say I have spent 1BTC but locked 3BTC in the channel, but for some reason I needed to claim back the 2BTC remaining would that be possible without waiting?

And all that create the condition for an health fee market,
Balance between Tx fees and Block size orphan risk.
Not a "wall" to crash against...
Otherwise Bitcoin has to modified to deal with that "wall" (safely record pending Tx for possible long duration, the network has to 'let you know' how much fees you suppose to pay and how long time to wait... etc...)
@_date: 2015-12-05 08:26:05




Agreed,

@_date: 2015-12-17 14:12:25


What I struggle to understand how come the fee already not exist?
Otherwise fee should be zero as there still capacity available in the blockchain?
What I think is even at 0.55MB blocks on monthly average we are already hitting the limit of a 1MB limited blockchain can process.
We would have no backlog and fee would be zero otherwise.
@_date: 2015-12-23 20:32:40
I understand your point of view,
I get to the opposite conclusion:
Let's increase the block limit to avoid disturbance on the network while giving time for other solution to mature.

@_date: 2015-12-30 11:34:36


Never meant to be that way.
Let me try it another way:
There is no **"no change"** choice. Either removing the limit or leaving it will cause major chance in the network.
Bitcoin core dev team **have chosen** to maintain the limit.
This is a centralised decision taken by the core dev, no BIP proposed for it.
@_date: 2015-12-31 12:53:08
Some PoW are design to be ASIC resistant,
Basically they use memory hard puzzle and there is no way to build fast and cheap memory (otherwise our computer would already be equipped with)
They claim to reduce to efficiency gain for CPU to ASIC to between 10x to 100x (much lower than now)
This could be enough to prevent mining to outcompete the cpu cumulative hashing power of the rest of the network,
@_date: 2015-06-02 10:04:14
I can understand, I guess..
@_date: 2015-12-08 11:39:05
I might have miss something, I will look into it deeper when I will have time.
But at first sight it doesn't to give any scaling benefits to full validating node.. If true I don't see the point..
Maybe it will make a bit easier to run a non-validating node, useful if you use LN (to monitor your channel).
But not much for validating node, they are the critical one..
@_date: 2015-12-19 19:32:38

But will bitcoin stay that low to no fees cryptocurrency?
With the block size debate it feels like lot of people want to change that and make bitcoin a very different beast indeed.

Well thank you that's nice..


I agree.. but you know what? I never said I did.
But on a side note, I think (wow again!!) nobody does! That my best explain for why we get so much bubble and crisis and shit..
Thank god you are here mister PHD of economics!
So why I don't think there no idea behind FIAT currency.. well because 1971... 
The dollar went off the gold standard not because their was a well thought idea.
"Yeah let's have an inflationary so people can make money with there house.." 
No.. It was to avoid america to default... So now we are stock with FIAT...


You are 100% right! this because property are used to make money that we have so many all new ... empty skyscraper (China) or even empty city (Spain).. yeah very healthy for an economy,
Without talking about housing bubble..
You know Mister PhD you should watch the all crash course youtube video I have linked in the post, you might learn something..
But well we know you won't, bye bye, stay smart and get rich!
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:29:21
For test purpose It make lot of sense, for sure.
But using sidechain to do thing Bitcoin already does, it's a bit harder for me to see why.

This is a solution..
But not for me sorry,
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:31:08
This is something miner will have to deal with..
Same thing as now you cannot mine anymore if you don't have enough hash rate then you will be disadvantaged if cannot download a 20MB on time...
(but com'on the bandwidth cost to deal with 20MB is negligible compare to the cost of hashing power..) 
@_date: 2015-06-15 07:46:36
The block size is not related to the miner income.
They income come from the coinbase + fees.
Miner can now, if they decide all they more income, to only include transaction with let's say 1 Btc of fee. 
You will always found someone willing to pay that much for big or emergency payment....
And publish only empty block as long as nobody is willing to pay the fee.
In that scenario they will make the explode the fees with the block size having nothing to do with it.
@_date: 2015-06-02 09:44:09
I agree it's borderline dishonest..
@_date: 2015-06-17 08:13:23
Holding a 51% attack for two weeks come with cost.
The energy cost for computation, the cost of mining hardware AND the cost of mining reward that you could have gain if you mined honestly. For two weeks!!
(if you want to kill bitcoin you can kiss goodbye your block reward, 2 weeks of block is about 14 million$... damned you really have to upset about bitcoin..)
Likely only doable by government.. I guess
But you are right It's not impossible. nothing new here.
I fail to see to where the dynamic block limit is making this attack more dangerous. the block size limit will adjust with the new longest chain. so it might adjust to zero, let's code a bottom limit. let's say block size limit never go under 1MB.
For those who are interested monero got an attack specially targeting the per-block dynamic block size limit and it recover well from it.
The block 202612 attack:
@_date: 2015-12-30 22:19:17
Actually it would be better if it was dishonestly.. Then they would be somehow be stoppable or able to compromise at some points,
But it they really believe they are saving Bitcoin with their actions/decision/code then they will be capable of anything to acheive their goal.. FUD.. DDoS .. Lies .. Controversial code change.. Everything they think can "save" Bitcoin..
That's much scarier..
@_date: 2015-06-14 18:38:58

You are right it's not directly related to Btcoin.

@_date: 2015-06-30 05:18:52
It's shame people where not aware of bitcoin before..
Because even if they discover bitcoin now.. it's a bit too late, you would not move saving to a system you just discover especially bitcoin witch can be a bit difficult to understand at the beginning...

Monero use a per-block dynamique block size limit, it might be interesting to see it more in detail.
@_date: 2015-12-31 12:43:52
The thing is there is no easy fix to mining centralisation.
It has already reach an extremely high level still with 1MB limit.
The truth is mining centralisation has much more to do with  the Chinese unparalleled manufacturing capability and very cheap electricity than with the block limit.. (Miner use a negligible amout of data)
Some have argued that if an industrial use is found to make use of the ASIC waste heat this could greatly increase decentralisation. 
But those things take time and during factory keep building new ASICs..
@_date: 2015-12-02 06:34:46

The incentive still exist with 20MB (with enough growth 20MB will be too small sometime) with 1MB you've got emergency..

You are right I didn't.
It is part of the free market, You have to spend money to make money,
But then again if you spend 1 million dollar in your mining rig and you move it to a place with very cheap electricity but crappy internet connection, well either you are knowingly taking a risk (nothing wrong with that) or.... you are an idiot really...
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:42:38
Thats a good point this would decrease the load on the node.
And I guess there not limitation on how many sidechain there is?
I can imagine bitcoin scaling to visa/mastercard level but with the help of 10s or 100s of sidechains,
Would sidechain need separate node and miner in the way the mainchain need?
And how would the sidechain miner get any reward?

The block are only big as the miner make them big,
If you want to bloat the blockchain It will take a long time and you will have to include a fee in the hope the miner will create big blocks.
Unless you 51% attack the network and create yourself big blocks but that would be expensive.
For what result? big blocks for a while and when you stop your attack block limit go back to normal.
(as it happen with the block 202612 Monero attack)
The Monero attack has cost the attacker some money even if the value of Monero is much smaller than Bitcoin.
It's great to have a chance to get feedback from alt-coins experiment.

Do you really thing small player have a voice now??
It's long gone the time small player could voice anything..
See centralised development, censorship and centralised mining in one single country..
Nobody can say that Bitcoin is trustless anymore..

The 1MB limit was not suppose to be permanent, Satoshi has been clear on that.
They installed their mining where it's most profitable, but they are not idiot they knew the bandwidth required will increase..
Regarding the halving... it's not the first halving, mining didn't stop last time, I don't see why it would now,
It's actually a perfect time to give mining a chance to get more income form fees,

And you can imagine that the fees can rise way more,
Let's say around christmas the fee are already very high, but some peoples need the send BTC ASAP whatever the cost.. the fee can just to 1BTC or more (whatever the amount of money you want to send...)
I think it's really unhealthy for the network to think that the market will find equilibrium against... a wall!!

Totally agree we don't need to make centralisation impossible, it cannot be done.
Just we need to avoid having a system that make centralisation to easy or to advantageous, like the current sha256 mining..
Sha256 PoW if very ASICs friendly.. 
Result when the first sha256 ASIC went out CPU were completely and definitely out of the game..
This can be avoided.

Where I disagree (but I might be wrong) is the incentive to pay big fees depend on the block size only when they are full.
Then it make sense you have to pay big fees to get your transaction in,
(scary situation..)
But whatever the size of the block any (or all) miner can decide even now (am I wrong?) to stop to include any free transaction or include only transaction with big fees,
They don't even have to all agree on that, they just have to act on their best interest. If all miner are not profitable anymore they will go for more profitable set of transactions. 
And I think it's easier to achieve with big block (more transaction to get fees from)
Fees slowly getting bigger part of the block reward, this behaviour should naturally appear.
It seems to me that bigger blocks would generate more mining income,

I know that the blockchain is a distributed consensus.
But I ask you why you said consensus **among miner** is needed.
Because I don't think it is, so either me or you have a misunderstanding on how mining works.
Miner just produce blocks that will be accepted or not by the node that when the consensus is reach.

@_date: 2015-05-12 15:05:47
Maybe I misunderstand the way mining work or maybe the fee gain (compare to block reward) are too low to have an impact now.
But as a miner I would look to fill my block with the most profitable set of transactions, having more fees would mean more profit.
And I thought empty block in the blockchain was a proof that there is already an incentive to pay, 
@_date: 2015-05-31 13:40:37
A block will be verified by the node and then when all the transactions is verified and it will send to other node,
So an extremely large will be very long to verify/propage , I will be very likely overtake by other block, then discarded,

A deflation with fiat currency is terrifying.
You need inflation with FIAT currency because the money supply need to increase to pay the interest on debt.
Money is created out of debt (fractional reserve..) you always have more debt compare to money available at in any given time.
You need inflation to catch up on that.
If you end up in a deflation you decrease the money supply then you increase the number of default which further decrease the money supply and the number of default... the "house of card" is falling.
In a bitcoin or gold standart currency the mechanic is different.
You are not in a debt-based society.
@_date: 2015-05-12 14:31:10
For the same mining revenu and with 1mb or 20mb blocks full transaction fees will be 20x more expensive for 20x less transactions processed for 1mb blocks..
(let say when the block reward will become negligeable)
Assuming 20mb block doesn't reduce the number of full node, aren't we better of with 20mb?

This is what segwit is doing and up to 4MB, if block are filled with large multisig transactions.
That mean with segwit the entire system has to designed to deal with 4MB block, because has to be still working under adversarial condition. *(and you only gain 1.75MB equivalent)*
With 2MB then you only get 2MB block period.
Regarding scaling soft fork segwit is simply worst than a straight forward block size increase.

I think there is a misunderstanding with the wording,
ASIC resistant doesn't mean ASIC are impossible it mean it is design to reduce the efficiency gap between cpu/gpu and ASIC.
Memory hard PoW are ASIC resistant.
(or if you prefer sha256 mining is **very** ASIC friendly)
Ultimately a PoW based on 3d graphics will be the closed to something totally ASIC resistant as graphics card are already very optimized for it.
It is very unlikely any manufacturers will be able to build an
 ASIC that will be 2 or 3 time more efficient than a current high end graphics card for that "3d graphics PoW".
If they they do, the improvement will also benefit regular computer graphics preventing the gap for gpu and ASIC to increase with time.

Great firewall of china.

Bigger block are safe within china's border and penalise the rest of the world.




I very much agree with /S




Xthin block avoid sending a second time a transaction your peer already got.
With Xthin your node is sending a list of transactions to create the block instead of the whole content again which unnecessary if your peer already know the transactions. 
Directly reducing bandwidth requirement to the point of becoming negligible when mempool are similar.
Block compression is another bandwidth optimisation being under development between 20-30% gain,
And form some inexplicable reasons none of those optimisations are planned to be added to core.
(none of them require consensus code change nor even a soft fork)

You don't know that ok,
I will reply to you by doing a little thought experiment,
Your are starting a full node, your node connect to the network and request blocks,
But your node has to check your blocks now, remember time stamp are unreliable.
And as long as your node has not verified the blocks chronology your node cannot build its blockchain.
(Otherwise you would be "trusting" other nodes making your node susceptible to attacks)
Then using your logic your node will check the PoW of each block, check the network difficulty, every block below the difficulty will be dropped as SPAM.
Then you would be left with the last week or two of blocks..
Obviously the is not the way it work, isn't it?
So what went wrong?

499btc are send to a change adress and 1 to the guy you pay, then if you spend 1btc again, 498 is send to a change address again.. It looks like 498BTC are moving back and forth between several address but in reality they are still in your balance.
@_date: 2016-03-16 14:11:46


Same goes for any ASIC whatever the PoW, I fail to see why it is particular to SHA256.


ASIC resistant is a good because it will prevent few mining farm to take control of the network like it happened with SHA256.
ASIC mining farm would still exist, but it would impractical to build a mining farm that would capture say 10% of the network (energy and cost).
With SHA256 now.. a single ASIC can outcompete 100s or 1000s of GPU..


Efficiency is the key, if an ASIC is not more efficient than a GPU then the GPU is not outdated.


This was an example, a 3D graphics PoW will likely take as much resource to verify than to solve the PoW so it not suitable.

No, I value decentralisation enormously..
Growth doesn't mean centralisation.
I fell sick when I see the very same people that say they fight for decentralisation, taking advantage of it by meeting with the few peoples that own vast majority of the network hash power to prevent an increase in capacity.
Whatever you think it is a good thing or not, It is proof that the network has centralised enough that it can be centrally planned.
I don't think network can centralise more that it is now..
All mining happen in china, operated by an handful of people, seconded by a single dev team willing to push massive change on the network.
I all honesty, the network is centrally planned. The remaining decentralisation left in the network is enable to prevent that, therefore the network can be discribe as centralised.
I think the only way for some level of decentralisation can be recover is with simple network optimization and increase capacity, so bitcoin become big enough that one entity can influence it anymore.
(And hopefully even against gorvernement.. But for that bitcoin would need to be massively bigger)
*I really worry about the mining centralisation.. I really think it is not impossible that we are already centralised beyond 51% level and the hash is share between several pool to keep low profile.
The global hash rate has more than triple in last three months and the global hash rate ratio between pool has bearly moved!! This is very fishy.. This suggests tight coordination. 
I sold 2/3 of my holding when I realized that.*

I am not joking what is his definition of safe in the Bitcoin network: irreversible? Decentralised? Censorship resistant? Reliable?
What is it?
For your NASA example, I am an aircraft engineer, I know a bit on safe/reliable system.
The NASA would never design a system to operate beyond its capacity therefore bring it into a non-tested/non-predictable state.
Beyond design capacity no system can guarantee reliability.

No neither exchange nor node are single point of failure currently.


I am not worrying so much about control but more about Bitcoin getting less resilient.
I am talking about single point of failure: a weakness that can end up killing bitcoin.
Bitcoin now cumulate 3 different one, each one of them would be serious enough... here we have three,
Dev centralisation, mining centralisation, forum/media centralisation.
IMO Bitcoin doesn't have the anti-fragile property of decentralised system anymore.


And it is seriously broken,


Well the core dev team could fit this definition of single entity that control bitcoin.






My point is bitcoin is getting less and less decentralised.
I am specially worry about mining..
The global hash rate has more than triple between Nov15 and Feb16.. and the market share between major mining pool stayed more or less the same.. **this is impossible without coordination** 
Bitcoin can very well be mined with one single entity well above 51% spreading out its hashing power to several mining pool to avoid trouble, there is no way to tell...
That would explain why there has been no major change in mining hash rate market share.. 


I said several point of failures.
for example an plane with one engine, the engine is a single point of failure.
If it fail the plane crash..
But the same aircraft can have another single point of failure due to bad design, say it got only one fuel tank, if your fuel leak it is another point of failure.
If the all the fuel leak out the engine stop, even if nothing was wrong with it, the plane crash.
The plane is not safer if it got two single points of failure, it's less safe.
I am worry that bitcoin is cumulating singles point of failure, loosing its anti-fragile property. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 17:33:45
I think so,
Even now some block are mined almost empty to make the propagation faster (which is another problem)

It's just regular wallet behavior if you got 500BTC and you spend 1BTC. The wallet will send 499BTC to a refund address and 1BTC to the address you pay.

@_date: 2016-03-16 06:31:33


Can you elaborate?
it is more profitable for manufacturers to mine with their own rigs.
How come sha256 prevent that in any way?


And that's the goal, keeping cpu/gpu mining relevant.


ASIC can be build with any PoW.
But the efficiency gap will not be as big as with sha256.
Imagine a PoW based on 3D graphics,
ASIC can be build but in no way they can be more than, say, 2x or 3x more efficient than regular GPU because GPU are already very good at it.
This would be a very ASIC resistant PoW.
Edit conclusion form the PoW documents:

Not incompatible at all.
the Core dev just has to patch core with a 2MB limit.
**And that would give time to finalize LN and segwit**

@_date: 2016-01-24 16:50:24
I guess only time will tell, 


Well the blockchain will be at full capacity well before 1MB for many reasons (like empty blocks..) 1MB is theoretical limit we will never reach... 


Why? bitcoin must be able to adapt, if a fork is needed it has to be done.. many other crypto do it without trouble.
(actually bitcoin will need one hard fork for a timestamp format that expire around 2030)


Because it's rushing complex consensus code change and a soft fork is an ugly to implement it.
@_date: 2016-01-18 11:50:29
Mining is definitely completely disconnected for bitcoin price..
That show that mining centralisation is only due to Chinese flooding the market with more and more ASICs only the one with enough $$ to buy those can survive, killing evey little miner in the process...

@_date: 2016-01-13 21:08:30
@_date: 2016-03-24 07:00:04


This is correct.


Yes 4MB is unlikely under normal network usage.
But this feature can be use as an advantage if a miner want to attack the network.
The miner can purposely build a block full of 15-15 multisig Tx then equivalent block will be 4MB. event worst if the miner create all tx himself and they are unknown to the network.
Then all other miner will have to request the witness to him, greatly slowing down the validation process.
A miner doing that will get a lot of hashing ahead time before the network finish to validate this block..


An attacker mines a segwit-block with 1000 transactions the network has not yet seen (The attacker creates these TX herself )The attacker has the witness data readily available. When other miners try to validate this block they will go through every single one of these TX and say "I don't have the witness data for this TX_ID, I have to call TCP::GetWitnessData( TX_ID ) aw yes this is valid"
All this impossible if segwit was hard forked with 2MB block size.
On top of that some data has to be added in the block to link the Tx to the witness data. Therefore it take **more** not less data to send the same txs in a block trough the network with SFsegwit than with a straight forward block sive increase. 
That mean a block size increase has more scaling effect.


@_date: 2016-03-23 14:46:19


Well I fail to see how a 2x increase in capacity will destroy bitcoin..
If so segwit will have the same effect.. Even worst as segwit can allow 4MB equivalent blocksize on the network.
If the network centralised due to a 2x larger block it will do whatever if the increase load on the network come from segwit or bigger block size..


What the fat have to gain from bigger block?
There is no financial interest behind the larger block proposal..
@_date: 2015-05-17 16:35:40
It actually great how simple is the system to reach consensus.

@_date: 2016-03-20 16:50:05
So safety is decentralisation,
Then bitcoin is not safe anymore.
Look at the previous picture, one of the hardest defender of small block shaking hand with 80% of miner hash rate..
Whatever you like it or not, it is colluding and with an handful of people that own well enough hash rate to reseverse transactions/censor the network or block/pass any change on the network.
This how much decentralisation there left in Bitcoin.. Next to none..
This is not what Bitcoin was meant to be, I failed to see what make Bitcoin different from the current financial system anymore, really...

@_date: 2016-03-28 09:52:22


Personally I don't care much about up or downvote, I care more about content of comment. 


Well it has been discussed ad nauseam...
There is not neutral point here, just "lawyer's talk"..
But bitcoin cannot continue to grow with capacity a limit without massive code change and economic change (those are not 100% predictable).
Keeping bitcoin economics and fundamentals working as it did since its inception required removing a patch added to prevent DDoS when the network was much weaker, few line of code change.
Hard fork has been performed successfully many times in other cryptocurrency and change much more disruptive than a block limit.
*(and bitcoin will actually need an hard fork in the future to update a timestamp format, so hard fork was never meant to be hard-fork proof, even one the last message from satoshi contain the code to remove that patch)*
So the question is more about what bitcoin will become than a technical one:
One other side want to change it on a settlement layer for 2nd layer network and change bitcoin economics.
The side ask for an increase so bitcoin can stick to its original vision (P2P ecash), which BTW allow settlement network too. 
That's why I say don't restrict it and let bitcoin found it's niche organically, nothing compare to it. Therefore it has potential to be much bigger than even digital gold.
The classic example is internet in the early 90's. Would that make any sense to restrict only to one function? say e-mail? who would have guess what internet would have 20 years down the road... and 10 years from now?

In the short term doubling the network capacity is important,
This will insure the network reliability until other solution has been developed.
Just the main is to keep the system running.
Over the long term I agree,

Hahaa :)
Hey all is good,
Keep dreaming Bitcoin is decentralised then!
@_date: 2016-03-02 08:41:57
Well there is lot of raison to avoid running out of capacity, specially when 2mb is acceptable.
Mempool growing too big is a concern for the network reliability for example.
All the off chain scaling proposals are unproven and under development. Why running into unnecessary risks?
@_date: 2016-03-01 14:47:31


Certainly not.


This is the definition of uncensorable.
Mining centralisation endangered this quailty undeniably.


By a negligible amout.
(Huge mempool size increase the cost of running a node too BTW...)
When in the other side mining centralisation has reached insane level. I am not sure you got your priorities right if you worry more about full node than mining centralisation.
There is even sign that mining is much more centralised than everybody thinks.
Hash power more than double in the last months and with the hash rate "market share" being very stable.
This **cannot** happen without coordination.
If you are genuinely worried about centralisation, I would advice you to exit bitcoin.

This is where our view split.

But capacity on chain is critical because it is the only 100% decentralised, 100% distributed, 100% neutral cryptocurrency tool, 
Any other off-chain solution come with compromise on either of those key qualities.
But it seems the Bitcoin community need to experience the pain first hand to understand that.
@_date: 2016-03-05 09:54:07


Whatever the fees, there is only room for about 3Tx/s.. (5Tx/s with segwit, maybe)

Not in case of an artificial capacity limit.
To keep bitcoin unchanged you need to remove the capacity limit.
Leaving the capacity limit and making a new way to *regulate Tx* will create massive change in bitcoin fundamentals.
@_date: 2016-03-20 14:43:23


Certainly not: 8GB limit would not happen before 20years.
High end computer and high end internet connection can run such a node on full blocks **today** making that proposal a conservative one.
Xthin block, head first mining, relay network and many other optimization possible make larger block safe.
(Gmax himself say that the relay made the block size irrelevant)

Yes but that still a progress,
If you have enough money and power to buy and run a million CPU then you have a corresponding reward. But with sha256, even one ASIC and little power giving a million cpu worth of hashing power.
Basically for the same increase in computation output in one case you have to invest billion and basically build a nuclear power plan and in the other one between 1000-2000$.
@_date: 2016-01-27 11:44:42


Indeed, it's been proven that it is impossible to solve, so Bitcoin probably fails to solve the theoretical problem, but instead solves a practical variant that—for all practical purposes—is somewhat similar.
It solve it just.. please forget about SPAM for a second..
-Two messages are received with about same amount of computational worked attached. 
It is impossible with any statistical significance to determine the messages chronology.
*note that a PoW is attached to those two message therefore they provide DDoS and SPAM protection as was the original purpose of hashcash.*
Yet with those two messages we are still stuck with the byzantine general problem. (hashcash provide no help used as it was designed for)
The genius idea of Satoshi was when the amount of computational work is **asymmetrical** then it because possible to asses the chronology of two messages with a very strong statistical certainty (the more PoW difference the more certainty).
-You get two message one with much more Pow attached to it.
You can deduce their chronology: the one with the smallest PoW if the first, the one with the largest PoW is the last one.
**This is a solution to the byzantine problem, no less.**


**Certainly** not accidental, are you joking?


Man, I agree with you big time, it so meaningless, but it Adam Black himself that compare himself to Satoshi.
Have a read to his twitter page:


Pretty much saying that he invented Bitcoin!

Not at all really, I am very aware the genuis biais..
See Darwin and Einstein story are both great example, history remember them as unique geniuses but anyone a little bit curious will discover that it was a lot more complex than that.
And same for Satoshi.
But certainly not put the Adam Black "Hashcash" invention at the same level of achievement as Satoshi "Blockchain". 
He barely provided a tool, a way mesure computational work.
Satoshi show that computational work can be use to reach consensus in p2p. 
(He could have use another way to achieve that than using hashcash)
This is a much higher achievement.

That can be pruned drop the storage requirement to between 3 to 10Go I believe.

If consider this storage cost unacceptable you are free to run SPV.
I am happy to take it for a trustless access to the blockchain.

Multiple implementation can work in concert, the important thing is for the end user to have choice. Then it became impossible for a few individual to gain too much influence over the network.


Simple, if a change required change in the consensus a code then a fork is offered to the network, the miner accept or refused the change.
This is actually not a scary and dangerous feature, it is how is was meant to be from the beginning.
Softfork can be much more insidious because it can be design in a way the upgrade cannot be refused by the network.
For example soft fork segwit, form the moment is deployed, if you get found from a segwit address an old node would be unable to spend. then you will have to update to be able to spend you fund.
Breaking the backward compatibly, making impossible for the network to refuse an upgrade. 


Listen to the community, being able to compromise would have help prevent this situation I think..


That I disagree, the sooner exploit or weakness are know the better it is.
Otherwise the longer they can be used by the people that know them.


That is my main concern, there is no way even if every mining farm order exactly the same ratio of ASICs at the same time over the last months than no big swig of hash rate mining share happened when experiencing a **300%** in three months!!.
Simple logistic problem (like not enough space to put new ASIC, or late delivery) would be showing big variation in the middle of such growth..
The only way I can explain that is only one massive mining got the the ASICs and spread its hash power evenly to every mining pool to stay "under the radar"

This has more to do with the unparalleled manufacturing power, cheap electricity and the need to avoid capital control.
The proof is the difficulty has kept raining and raising even when the price stagnated or dropped.. 
China bombarded the market with ever perfomant ASIC, and as the electricity is cheaper in china, the majority of the hash power stay within the great firewall of china.. Whatever the block size.. (Actually the smaller the block the better for Chinese)
No another country anywhere in the world with both cheap electricity and massive manufacturing capability.. 
Actually the Chinese government cracking down on bitcoin might the best thing that can happen to us then all the ASICs will be sold outside china and will a massive bost in decentralisation (and a big mess for few weeks).

You could have read link a least.
Satoshi was well aware of the byzantine general problem. It was known to everyone involved in cryptocurrency research.
Time stamp are unreliable (this is another way of saying byzantine problem)
but ok let's follow your logic.
If PoW is SPAM protection why do why do new block has to included a hash of the previous block?
After all if it only a SPAM protection system, the only thing the system is a difficulty target and the first one to meet the difficulty target is the that found the next block.
Why bother with that hash?
@_date: 2016-03-02 20:40:58




With the level of mining centralisation we actually experience, bitcoin can be massively disrupted by Chinese government or corruption relatively easily.
Node is not an issue, mining centralisation is a **major** one.
Increase capacity allow for more users and growth meaning more node.




Well they don't exist, none of them even have a finished white paper.
It is easy to increase capacity to give those solution time to be developed.




More than 1mb of Tx for the network to process on average.


Why kind of evidence are you asking for? Blocksize is public and median average block is above 900kb..


Capacity wall and fee event are an easy risk to avoid.

@_date: 2016-01-28 07:16:25


No, that has nothing to do with.
Hashcash was a set PoW attached to a mail to flag as non-SPAM.
It the byzantine problem that made cryptocurrency impossible because it was impossible to get concensus on which order the transactions has to be recorded in the blockchain.
 &gt;Again, if you receive one email with a Hashcash PoW and another email with a lesser Hashcash PoW, then you use that *asymmetry* to quickly choose which one to read first; you *define* the email with more PoW to be more sincere, and therefore more worthy of consideration—of&amp;amp;nbsp;course, it could still be junk.
No all block in the as the value to get consensus on "who own what" PoW is only use to assess their chronology.
 &gt;Again, if you receive one blockchain with a Hashcash PoW and another blockchain with a lesser Hashcash PoW, then you use that *asymmetry* to quickly choose which one to read first; you *define* the blockchain with more PoW to be more sincere, and therefore more worthy of consideration—of&amp;amp;nbsp;course, it could still be junk (maybe it doesn't contain valid data).
No, no blocks are more worthy of consideration than any other. This not how blockchain work.
They have every a set of PoW, if two come with the same amout of PoW there chronology cannot be assessed the blockchain fork and another block is needed to find consensus again.


It is.
 &gt;All the pieces of Bitcoin were already well-understood (I mean, it's split-piece transactional structure is arguably hundreds of years old); what people didn't realize is that *spam&amp;amp;nbsp;control* is a great way to think about maintaining an honest record, and that insight is what Satoshi provided.
No. You are trying to re-define things.
 &gt; It was well understood that Hashcash's flaw is that computers and computer networks become more powerful, such that it becomes easier for spammers to forge what appears to be meaningful proof of work; this is particularly the case, because emails aren't typically part of long chains with compounded proof of work.
Email have nothing to do with a blockchain...
 &gt;Because the decentralized email system doesn't operate in a peer-to-peer network designed to consolidate information about the difficulty of producing a proof of work, there is no clear way to agree upon what that difficulty should be, so it is simply left to each email server to choose its own configuration.
Email have nothing to do to byzantine, why whould apply to it a blockchain??
 &gt;Bitcoin's very purpose as a peer-to-peer network that maintains a single record allows for it to collate the data necessary to choose a single difficulty dynamically. It's a much easier problem for a system like Bitcoin to solve.
Call it whatever you want but blocks have all the same value to reach concensus. Block with less PoW are not less worth (?!) they are as important for bitcoin than any other one.

Thanks for your calculation,
That sound rather hard to reach, indeed.
Two order of magnitude of growth,
My guess it is more likely that the network will stabilise on an equivalent block reward after the halving.. (so equivalent 50MB)
And with fees 2x higher or bitcoin 2x more valuable 25MB could an sustainable point.
25MB point seem to be technologically doable,
The thing I get from it is *it is doable* maybe not the full 25 block reward equivalent form fee but 12.5 block reward equivalent maybe,
And having 25x more Tx would be extraordinary good for Bitcoin, it likely some kind of wide spread adoption..
PS: on a side note Litecoin (with more capacity) have had blocks with 5% of revenu came from fee..

More precisely Bitcoin start to form three singles point of failure:
The core dev team, the 2 or 3 Chineses miners that can easy collude to get +51% *(after all the meeting organized every second week they must start to know each other pretty well)* and the media *(forum\Reddit)* with commun heavy moderation policy.
In a sense Bitcoin is getting even more fragile than a centralised system who typically only got a single point of failure.
Well to reply quickly:

Well you seem to say that only 0conf are not "stable".
All the rest (confirmed Tx, LN payment channel) are trustless.
The truth is not that black and white,
1 confirmation Tx can be on a yet to be orphaned block, your coin on a LN payment channel can be stolen too (counter party cheating, SPAM forced expiration attack *see LN white paper*)
All involve some level of thrust, only 6+ confirmations Tx are viewed as not reversible.

Why a coinbase transaction be an opt-in RBF?
@_date: 2016-01-01 12:20:50
Well if you win your bet and the core dev successfuly maintain control over Bitcoin.. Then bitcoin will be drastically changed..
I am not sure anybody win..
@_date: 2016-03-21 07:15:16


Because it is 20mb block limit and not block size.
Miner will not publish unreasonably large block on the network because it will expose them to orphaned block..
Very very expensive for them.
20mb was supposed to buy us time to set up scaling solution without hitting capacity.
Gavin say (and **still** say today) that unlimited block will be fine but it couldn't advocates for it because it cannot prove it.
This what you would expect from a responsible dev.




Well Greg Maxell said it:
Not that now that block compression, Xthin block and relay first mining exist, now the argument is block is not the issue it is the latency.
Edit: clarity typo
@_date: 2015-05-17 15:39:40
Maybe it can be corrected:
each payment = one vote
But you need to limit the vote to those who own more than a bitcoin (for exemple) to avoid spam.
@_date: 2016-01-12 11:15:08
The sticky about opt-in RBF seems to suggest that.

Interesting it probably already doable now,
I assume outdated ASICs are cheap and when your electricity cost hit 0 they are not outdated anymore..
Interesting idea..
Maybe difficult business case because all your ASIC will be sleeping most of the time waiting for a power surge..
@_date: 2016-01-24 13:37:20


It interesting I get to the exact opposite conclusion:
That LN appeal to the non technical person, it seems they instantly think everything will be fix by it... 
Then indeed with that mindset it make sense to refuse any change to in the block size limit.
But it's really it's unclear if LN can or will be able to scale to any significant manner and not come with serious side effect. (Well it doesn't even exist, does it?)
To me it come down to this:
Increase the block to prevent any fee event (2MB would save us for this year) and take the time needed to release segwit and LN.. 
Please do rush it!!! It is one of the big code change in Bitcoin history.. And that includes some consensus code.. **don't rush it!**
Is such a crazy request? Keep Bitcoin running?
@_date: 2016-01-24 16:23:39
There are case when trust is needed in LN,
In case of forced SPAM transaction attack the Greg Maxwell solution to prevent your coin being stolen in the channel is to "trust" miner to flag blocks as flooded to prevent your timelock transaction to be unlocked.
This required miners will cooperate at risk to loose your coin, this is trust.
If that happen you better hope miners are happy with LN if they don't they can easily attack it that way..
See timestop LN white paper.

Is there any reason to prefer limited capacity?




There is only so much tx you can fit in a 1mb.
Once the Bitcoin network get more than 1mb to process on a daily basis the mempool will grow to unmanageable size.




Running out of capacity is a real risk.
@_date: 2016-01-23 07:39:26


LN will reduce the load on the network if bitcoiner use the network on a daily basis, otherwise they will keep using onchain Tx. 
How many Tx the average Bitcoin user send? Very little, the main use of bitcoin is hoarding.
@_date: 2016-01-26 08:31:41
Have a read on the byzantine general problem:
PoW is needed to solve the byzantine general problem.
Thought insolvable before bitcoin.
The way satoshi used it to solve that problem was brilliant.
@_date: 2016-01-23 07:34:42
Usual fallacy: **bitcoin can only be strong if it stay small.**
At the current market the easiest way kill bitcoin is big pump and dump by a government/bank..
The cost would be very low an no hardware needed,
And BTW with more than 51% hash power in China, Chinese gorvernement is in a nice position to severally harm Bitcoin.
**No bitcion in not strong now and it need to grow much larger to get more resilient!**
@_date: 2016-01-26 09:17:05






And this a solution to the byzantine problem: *how to reliably timestamp Tx in a p2p network*
Hashcash existed for ten years before Bitcoin. Nobody thought it could be used to solve the byzantine problem and make cryptocurrencies possible but Satoshi.


No, It became possible to know in which order the Tx are submitted to the network in a trustless manner because you just need to check the amount work attached to a block to know what is the longest chain.


It is no uneconomical, it is impossible to cheat the blockchain because your have to attach the right amount of computational work to it.
The longest chain is the one with more computational work and it is the valid blockchain. Nothing to do with SPAM. 
It has to do with reaching consensus on which order the Tx are recorded in the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-01-18 10:29:12

It is more costly,
SPAM attack critically depend on cost being very low.
Bigger block=SPAM attack more expensive=less SPAM attack.
And SEGWIT will increase capacity without increasing the COST of SPAM.
As you dont pay for the signatures data, a SPAMMER  can send large multisig tx to impact even more the network for the same cost.
Segwit=more impact for the same cost=more SPAM attack.
@_date: 2016-01-31 08:23:42
Well.. Bitcoin valuation is critical to get it sustainable...
Remember the network it subsidised to the tune of 25btc per 10min.
That will not last.. In ten it will already drop to 3.125btc,
@_date: 2016-01-24 12:21:59
Your right most likely with such a large amount, 
But doesn't it look more like a wallet behavior (with change address?)
@_date: 2016-01-24 16:37:35
I guess it all depend on how the network will work at such a scale.
But if the network is running 100% capacity with every user doing 2 settlements a year that will imply weeks if not months to wait before your Tx will be include in the blockchain.
Doesn't seem practical and LN closing Tx are time sensitive.
@_date: 2016-01-20 07:09:44
He didn't address the real issue.




A LN channel is basically a hot wallet.
Unless you can open a channel "offline" your private keys (or whatever it will be called can be exposed.
This is not a LN flaw it is commun knowledge that no computer can be 100% resistant to hack or attack.
It would be risky to ever put more in a LN that you would put in a hot wallet.
This would result in much more frequent opening and closing channels to "secure" your coins.
And another point, LN closing Transactions are time sensitive.
If the network is congested it can result to loss of your coin.  
@_date: 2016-03-14 21:38:50


Not necessarily some Pow claim to be botnet resistant,


@_date: 2016-03-05 07:17:46


hahaa really, 
You must be joking?
And running out of capacity and creating a fee event is somewhat safer?
Please provide me *Hard, empirically verifiable numbers would be preferred, with real word test setups* discribing the consequences on the network of running out out capacity?

My guess is Viacoin got the same 1MB block limit but with block every 24s..
This would mean 25x more capacity than bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:21:36


Indeed it is complicated.
Mining reward will drop from 25BTC to 3.125BTC before 10 ten years, valuation will have to increase a lot.

@_date: 2016-01-21 09:27:51
Agreed, simplistic view.
Many change can be made to the protocol without hard fork.
Also misleading graph demonstrating the likelihood of an hard fork to succeed depend on the level of centralisation of a system.
It depend on level of cooperation of their user.
A system can have high level of centralisation and the chance of a hard fork success being successful very low (if people disagree with the change)
A system can have high level of decentralisation and the chance of a hard fork to succeed being successful being very high (if people support the change)
Well managed hard fork are performed regularly on other crypto when protocol need to be up-dated.
@_date: 2016-01-05 20:51:32


It's hard (impossible?) to say.. Ideally you want the difficulty to keep raising or at least stay stable, otherwise the quantity of out-dated ASICs sleeping around accumulated over the years will start to be a threat to the network...
(on the wrong hands if someone really want to attack the network and not make money..)
@_date: 2016-01-30 08:54:39


1MB or 2MB certainly isn't one.
@_date: 2016-01-24 12:19:18


Remember that's an average with all Tx evenly spaced in time.
It's likely the blockchain will need a block limit two to three time larger than that to deal with peak demand.
@_date: 2016-03-01 15:58:26
I think LN tx are larger than average tx so you might need a bit more than that.
Between 200mb and 400mb I guess.
@_date: 2016-01-21 13:25:02
You can have several implementations with the same consensus rule.
Or like Bitcoin unlimited, you have different consensus rule because it track consensus whatever the blockchain.
Obviously it would be ridiculous to running a node that disagree with the Bitcoin network consensus rules...
@_date: 2016-01-05 20:26:10
I am not quite sure I understand the mean of O(N^2) scaling, 
It seem to imply the node resource require increase exponentially with the number of Tx but it grow linearly, am I wrong?
if the number of transactions double it take 2 more resource to run a node and not 4x time as O(N^2) seem to suggest?.
@_date: 2016-03-14 19:42:38
Scaling on chain can be optimized, little to no effort has been made in that direction with bitcoin so far.
So yeah an alt-coin can scale better than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-06 11:59:56

@_date: 2015-05-12 12:41:15
I agree with you,
Also I don't understand when people say bigger block give lower fee reward?
Bigger block= more transactions=more fee reward!
Isn't it common sense?
Miner can already choose to not add free transaction in their block so there is already an incentive to pay fee,
(there are empty block in the blockchain) 
So a block 20x bigger will give 20x more fees,
Exemple, Block 356081 fees=0.2419477BTC (2/3 full)
0.2419477 x 25 =  6 BTC
Not bad no? 
It's a step toward miner getting only fees for income,
Maybe I misunderstand something..

We don't seem to agree on the definition of alt-coin.


You are no longer talking about bitcoin, you are talking about an altcoin.
Alternative implementation are 100% compatible with bitcoin core, how can they be an altcoin?
Soft fork segwit introduce non-backward compatible change then is it an alt-coin?
**no non-upgraded node will be able to spend segwit funds** then by your logic you segwit is has to be an altcoin?
Don't you see that logic is flawed?


This is because you somehow think hard fork is bad.
You fail to see that soft fork can be bad too, if not worst.
And rushing the biggest consensus code change that has ever been made in bitcoin history for a 0.75x capacity increase and added DDoS weakness is madness.
This is a valid argument for compromise, 
Ideally the core dev should have accepted the hard fork to 2MB to give time to finalize segwit/LN and get the best implementation possible for us, not for them.
This is my opinion.
And just curious how long have you been in bitcoin?

You can run an alternative implementation, it will directly used your downloaded blockchain files.
They are 100% compatible as long as the 2MB fork don't happen.
None of the network optimisations introduced by alternative implementations are consensus code change.


Because the soft fork implementation of segwit **is a concern.**


Then you should read more early Satoshi post.
I guess you are new to bitcoin.


I am not promoting any alt-coin but alternative implementations.
I badly wished bitcoin recover some decentralisation, too few peoples got to much power over it. 
I certainly don't promote bitcoin anymore as long as it is in such high level of centralisation and with a reckless dev team having full control on it..
I stopped buying in Aug 15 and have sold 3/4 of my coins now, if you really want to know..
But instead of discussing intention you should discuss the argument otherwise you will always get stuck in "conspiracy ideas" and be easily manipulated.
Now you *trust* the core dev team for whatever they do even if I present to you some real case for concern..
Bitcoin was meant to avoid the need for *trust...*
Again take the chance to read some satoshi posts and build your opinion and not stick to: "you must be promoting an alt-coin if you critic the core dev team"

Not anymore...
@_date: 2016-03-23 15:52:23


Why and how?
And why this somewhat doesn't apply to segwit?
That I don't understand.


Very true, 
It's actually already the case now.
~6 to 7 peoples own the vast majority of the network hash power. Definitely way beyond safe level.


I have yet to have an explaination why larger and capacity thanks to soft fork segwit is safe (up to 4mb equivalent block) and 2mb block limit is dangerous.
@_date: 2016-01-19 06:49:45
Well only when the code will out and tested we will have an idea of how scaling effect bring LN.
@_date: 2016-03-20 08:16:43


bitcoin got all that.
Odd to make that a priority when mining\dev\media centralisation has reach max level...
@_date: 2016-03-05 15:56:05
I did,
And there is many issues with LN and a small block limit.
@_date: 2016-03-02 07:05:54
To make it short:
On chain scaling work and it's possible to day.
Off chain scaling is still unproven and under development.
**keep the system running**

Ok, I have no been able to make any return.
@_date: 2016-03-03 11:01:52
so what is segwit?
@_date: 2016-03-18 06:40:12

And be a bit open minded.

Honest question.
@_date: 2016-01-24 11:09:29
Interesting thought, 
I guess as long as they make a profit it's not a bubble,
Well if it happen to burst (everybody mining at a loss hoping for a raise in price that never) that would send quite some turbulence in the network...

@_date: 2016-01-24 14:06:20
Sure, but with thin blocks spreading very fast throughout the network this block will be at great risk to be orphaned,
@_date: 2016-01-17 09:18:51
Well a block that take forever to verify as every chance to be orphaned.. Then good buy the 25BTC..

@_date: 2016-01-20 15:09:06


Yes the SHA256 bitcoin core fork will be forked, the original chain will be abandoned..
And we will be stuck in endless discussions on which one is an altcoin...
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:31:10


Well when you are in the regular shop you don't wait for confirmations (much harder to attempt a double in that situation) and when you buy something on internet they wait confirmations before sending the product (because there are more likely to be victim of a double spend in that configuration).
Bitcoin work(ed) smoothly in both case.
 
@_date: 2016-01-21 09:49:44


Or just read the argument, check the source, think, discuss.
@_date: 2016-01-25 11:00:55
Yes better to use the most ASIC resistant also possible.
@_date: 2016-03-17 08:58:58




Yet the mining barrier of entry is extremely high and centralisation has reached ridiculous level with SHA256.
The author of the link you provided seem to fail to see the current mining situation.
BTW a memory-hard problem doesn't mean more complex.
From the link I gave you:






Yet again, this doesn't relate to reality.
Immense centralisation force came from the fact that commodity computer are massively outcompete by ASICs, making possible for an handful of people to own the network security.
All bitcoin validating node could be mining on their own hardware and they will not have a slightest chance to mine a block in decades..
Making them irrelevant to bitcoin security model.
The goal of an ASIC resistant PoW, or egalitarian PoW as it called sometime, is to ensure commodity computer still participate and be relevant to bitcoin, immensely improving decentralisation.
There is an intense fight in bitcoin community for node being able to run on people's computer. this is the same thing, regarding mining.  




This is true for SHA256 ASICs, the aim of egalitarian PoW is to prevent/reduce that.


From the link I gave you:


is inherently parallel, any parallel implementation of its components
quickly exhaust available memory bandwidth and thus
has only limited advantage while running on GPU or ASIC.
Altogether, we get a memory-hard, ASIC- and **botnet-resistant
PoW with extremely fast verification and very small proof size**
All I am saying is some research has been done since SHA256 hashing, some improvement can be made to reduce the centralisation force at play in the mining industry.
@_date: 2016-03-28 17:20:19
I am in the list,
I don't what to think about it so much..
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:14:19
Indeed I think the priority should be reaching enough adoption to make Bitcoin sustainable on fee alone.
The day we reach that point will be a key milestone for Bitcoin: It will not be an experiment anymore,
Taking any action to delay Bitcoin adoption before we reach that point can seriously endanger bitcoin.. IMHO.

(If well planned hard fork carry no risk have beneficial side effects)
@_date: 2016-01-24 12:37:22
Soft fork introduce a lot of complexity..
And segwit require a lot of consensus code change.
Saying that soft forking segwit on the network is 100% is naive (specially is rushed).
@_date: 2016-01-22 17:27:18
Such fast block must be problematic..
I am not sure I understand that choice,
And 25x is just theoretical such a blockchain will have huge number of orphan so I think miner will only publish very small block,
 
My guess is it doesn't have much more capacity than bitcoin blockchain in real.
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:02:39
Well is that R3 such a threat? personally I don't think so,
Banks are trying to make a crypto to reduce their cost (AFAIK),
Everybody know how inefficient they are, big fat corporation protected from competition for decades, it's not much of an issue for us..
If this really is? well game on! I am sure people will take every chance to get away from bank if they can and prefer BTC..
(well I would be really not concerned if bitcoin add more capacity avail) 
@_date: 2016-01-23 17:44:12
Because it's the easiest way to increase capacity and would give time to the more "elegant" to be developed and tested.


LN cannot bring bitcoin to that level of Tx unless you never settle on the the main chain (with 1MB)
@_date: 2016-01-13 16:51:51

well you are asking for a return of trust in a trustless system?
@_date: 2016-01-22 07:36:15
Then maybe the "classic" side of Bitcoin should fork and change PoW..
(And with a very ASIC resistant PoW so we don't end up being own byvChina again)
@_date: 2016-01-11 07:28:22
If node relay double spend network-wide it would be easier to monitor any double spend attack.
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:42:12


How can you tell fee will be up only "a bit"?
The only scenario that would happen if adoption stall when we hit the capacity limit (pretty much ..now..) then fee pressure will not increase anymore and fee will stay stable.
That would be a catastrophic scenario! 
(adoption is needed, keep in mind there will three halving in the next 10 years..)
Regarding fee price.. there is no way to tell if fee will increase only a little..
During the 70s oil crisis it's production drop of 30% that lead to a 4 time increase in price!! ($3 to $12) price don't react in a linear/predictable manner..


I make no secret I would support any further increase of the block cap limit as long as the network gained enough adoption to be sustainable on fee alone.
@_date: 2016-03-01 12:10:10


How is that a solution, sidechain carry the cost model as the main chain or an alt-blockchain?


I care very much about decentralisation and I am for big block, interresting?
I am actually exiting Bitcoin slowly because of the level of centralisation.
(So centralised that it just take a meeting in an hotel conference room to decide the future of Bitcoin.. This is unacceptable for me)
I am of course talking about mining centralisation, node centralisation is no way near the same level urgency.
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:58:48
And third world country adoption can be a major driver for valuation, this thing are no linear and non predictable,
Low fees can critical to get Bitcoin sustainable, Bitcoin now losing user case.
@_date: 2016-01-14 13:47:25
Ok thanks
That quite a different number indeed!
@_date: 2016-03-10 06:24:01
It will be a different story when will be chronically over capacity, (not just one day)
The is a situation that haven't been tested and this will be the real fee event.
@_date: 2016-01-19 07:01:07
@_date: 2016-01-24 17:11:07


This is different in this situation if anything miner will have incentives not to cooperate, because everyone will try to RBF their Tx with higher fees to get ahead of the queue.
Then you have to trust they will act against you interest.
@_date: 2016-01-23 07:18:20
Yes both carry a risk:
Hard fork little code change VS soft fork with the biggest code change in Bitcoin history (and rushed to be out in few months!). Plus both need system wide update.
Saying segwit is low risk is naive.

How come Greg maxwell quit Bitcoin development?
He will have to close blockstream, what he will say to his investor?
That doesn't make sense.

Hahaa excellent that what I wanted to calculate!!
@_date: 2016-03-20 17:54:49
Which is all defeated by the level of collusion and influence made on the network by a few.
Which the definition of centralisation.
@_date: 2016-03-29 10:55:34
That rather odd.. I almost not comment on rbitcoin for the last three months.. I don't know how he collect his data..
@_date: 2016-03-24 09:07:07




No it is impossible to push 4MB of data to the network to process with a 2MB block limit.


With 2mb block limit the network process 2MB of data every ten minutes.
If you believe big block create centralisation this is important.


Pointless if you end with a system more exposed to DDoS attack and less optimum designed.


Already running in alternative implementation.




The witness data has to be send too.
There is no space saving it is just an accounting trick.
So either segwit is safe an large block are safe or it is unsafe and larger block are too.


Segwit carry many feature of hard fork:
It break backward compatibility: old node cannot spend fund received with segwit.
It allow previously forbidden condition: net will be allowed to process more 1MB of data per 10min.
This is what is used to define an hard fork.




Segwit as an hard fork is dead simple to implement.
Seeing the recent network optimisation pushed by small independant team when core dev team just live on promises.. I have no doubt bitcoin can progress (fast) with independent devs.


**HARD FORK segwit**
So we get the best implementation, the most resistant to attack, the most optimised!


The solution is in compromise,
The full-on 2nd layer approach form the dev is scary.
The transaction level out for the first time in bitcoin history. there is reason to worry.


Well Hard fork segwit, implementation is much simpler and easy (no need to "hack" the old node to make them believe the Tx are valid) and the block limit will still be protecting the network instead of giving **attackers** a DDoS weakness.
*(the intentional 4MB multisig block to slow other miners)*


I hope so..
@_date: 2016-03-14 20:56:33
@_date: 2016-01-26 08:09:35
No, you have a basic misunderstanding on why a PoW is needed in bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-22 20:48:05


I don't think so they are both very simple proposal:
Scaling "on chain" or scaling "off chain"
I have noticed people get much more easily applied by "off chain" scaling as it sound much more simpler/cleaner and doesn't have that bloated blockchain and bandwidth.
It takes quite a lot of time to understand that it's not a problem nor a flawed design and mining centralisation doesn't result for the block size (But from Chinese very specific characteristics and political situation mainly).
I find the statement "let's scale to infinity on 2nd layers there will be side effects" very populist and dangerous.
@_date: 2016-01-12 17:51:23

Then can you elaborate on what are those *non-bitcoin* reasons to increase the block size??
@_date: 2016-06-09 07:16:24


It's open source, once implemented on BTC it can easily be on any alt coin.


And prevent bitcoin from growing which can make stronger against financial attacks, regulators and increase decentralisation..
And bring bitcoin closer to be sustainable (getting block reward entirely paid by fee so biycoin can remains inflation-free)


See the alt coin raise.. That happen just when bitcoin reached capacity..


Cannot be more centralised than bitcoin with an handful of people owning all the hash power.

To complete the analogy of the night club would be:
You only granted access to the night club when you give the hashes of your $500 and he has been able to verify that the hashes come from a $500 note.
This hashcash, you have been able to proof that you burn some resources. No exchange of any value, no transactions.
It it not a financial transactions.
What RPOW does, is to allow the bouncer to exchange the hashes of the $500 note with a new fresh $500 dollars note.
This is RPOW, a transfer of value between the bouncer and you happend.
It was a financial transactions.


Like paper, POW has no currency properties.


Only if implemented as RPoW.
Because RPOW allow for possible tranfer of value.


You are describing the way paper got "implemented" to become a currency.
On its own paper has not currently properties (like PoW), implemented in the gold standard system (and afterward the FIAT system) it does.


Hashcash is not analogous of the earliest form of paper money (receipts for a deposit) because contary to it, it fail at transferring value a commun key feature of all currency, it is a proof of burnt energy, that's all that it is.


Classic misunderstanding: if is cost to produce therefore it has value.
It is a fallacy.
Burnt energy can be done as a complete lost.
A proof of burnt energy only prove to you have successfully passed a challenge ask by the PoW algo.


Can you describe how Satoshi used Hascash in Bitcoin?


It is not, they are very much linked together, the more PoW in invested in the blockchain the more Bitcoin is secure (and valuable) and also the more miners have to spend energy to find a block the more FIAT spending miner (energy bills) creating some level a selling pressure.


I agree.


I see POS as very experimental, 
And don't really understand how they can be secure indeed.


Well in Bitcoin we basically use inflation to pay for the POW, to the tune of 95%+ (block reward)
Bitcoin is a long for being sustainable on fee alone.
@_date: 2017-01-14 19:16:52

@_date: 2017-01-02 17:02:37

I found the coin distribution very shady:
70% form the pre-sale, two year PoW and then PoS zero inflation.
All coin distributed in two years??
Very concentrated distribution + PoS (bad for distribution)
It's a no go for me.
@_date: 2017-01-01 08:52:22


Wikipedia Hashcash:
* advantage over micropayment 
* no real money is involved 
Hashcash **is not** a currency **period.**
The fact that hash cannot be re-use make it fail at being an medium of exchange therefore a unit of acount and finally a store of value.
It literally has no feature of a currency.
Your arguments hold only ln the fact that hashcash use currency-like terminology.
It is a not an argument.
What you are talking about is the project form Hal Finney (2004) RPOW:


This project by Hal Finney **fit** the definition of Hashcash extended with inflation control. 
**Not Bitcoin,** because bitcoin use hashcash in a very different way, it use it to reach consensus among thousand of nodes (that allow decentralisation) not create a "cost" to new token creation (that cannot be decentralised).


RPOW white paper.
The best way to define how hashcash relate to Bitcoin is:
*Hashcash is the tool use by Bitcoin to reach consensus.*
**It is not a small achievement, it was a major breakthrough thought to be impossible...** 
Even Greg Maxwell said this problem cannot be solved.


See the bizantine general problem. 
 great read! 
Saying the truth is not downplaying the role of Adam Black in cryptocurrency.. this was an historic achievement. 
Actually **much** more significant than try mislead people into thinking Bitcoin is just an extension of hashcash. (Like RPOW was)
Why trying so hard to mislead people?
@_date: 2017-01-10 19:07:37


Now he already brought the problem on large for another mega transaction.




&amp;gt;So not only would “bigger blocks now” not have solved the problem, but segregated witness *would* have prevented it happening. So the transaction he tried to use as an argument for bigger blocks was actually an argument for segwit. :)
Please can you elaborate how malleability can lead To unconfirmed tx without being victime of an attack?

@_date: 2017-01-01 19:21:06
Ok, let me take analogy too.
Say a night club has found an innovative way to limit the number people getting in and keep only the weathy.
To get in this night club you are requested to burn a $500 dollars note in front of the bouncer.
Only if you do that you are granted access in the club.
By burning this $500 no value has been exchanged, no financial transaction happened,
This is very similar to what happen with hashcash, no transactions ever happen, no exchange of value therefore hashcash is simply not a currency. It is something different.
A PoW is basically a proof of burnt energy. Burnt energy has no value and has absolutely no currency properties.
Interestingly enough energy *(assuming some level of scarcity)* would make a great currency. 
*(Some have argued the ultimate form of currency)*


I am, I found this statement misleading to say the least.
As I said it can apply very well to the RPOW project as hash are directly used to create token, absolutely not for Bitcoin.


I have no particular issue with Adam Black beside that odd statement.


Implemented in RPOW it has some, whitout providing much benefit from a trusted database due to the double spend problem.
Hashcash on its own has none.
Very much like paper has no currency properties but implemented in the FIAT system bank note (paper) has value..
You didn't reply to my question: do you know that the Bitcoin PoW is implemented in a radically different way than RPoW?
It is actually important to understand ho much of a breakthrough using PoW to build a blockchain was.
Edit clarity and typos

The difference is hashcash doesn't represent something of value it represents a cost you are willing to waste to access the service.
A challenge you are willing to pass (burning the $500)
The service you are gaining access using POW is not getting anything of value that it can further exchange therefore it is not a transaction.
You pay it by wasting resources it doesn't mean a financial transactions happened because the recipient never got any currency of value it can exchange again.
You have been given a challenge to pass to be granted a service, it is very different from being asked to exchange an item of value to access a service.


Without that properties what you are sending is not a medium of exchange, it is simply something different.
A proof of challenge, a proof of burnt energy.
It is very different than a currency, you would agree?


POW has no intrinsic value because once energy has been burnt it is gone and cannot be used again therefore it cannot hold any value.
What you are doing is respond to a challenge, not paying to access a service.
This precisely what Hal Finney tried to do with RPOW to make it a currency, by exchanging spend POW by a fresh one, making was possible to use POW hashes as a medium of exchange.


Hashcash POW hashes never value.
RPOW might have, I am not even sure this project ever been tested..




Because the way POW is used is to allow the network to know what is the valid chain.
The longest chain (the one whith the most POW) is the valid one.
Now that the whole network can find consensus on a set of rules and on transactions history, Bitcoin can retain value and be used as a medium of exchange *(the future will tell us if it can be a reliable store of value)*
This is an immense breakthrough, I struggle to understand why Adam Black put such a strong emphasis on some (weak) pseudo-currency properties of hashcash when it could emphasize that hashcash help Bitcoin solve the bizantine general paradox.
For years it was thought to be impossible.


This is exactly how Bitcoin pay for its POW by debasing the currency (block reward = inflation)


Cost doesn't equal to value.
If it cost 1$ to mined the equivalent of one Bitcoin, then miner will have to spend 1$ of FIAT value to create it.
They will have then to sell 1$ worth of Bitcoin for it. This creates selling pressure.
POW is not free, it has to be paid for.
Most of the miner run on very tight margins, meaning most of the block reward create selling pressure. Inflation happens, if price increases it is just because demand go beyond the current inflation.


It is impossible unless POW cost nothing.
POW have a cost by definition.


 
It is.
There only two way to pay for the POW by block reward (inflation) or transactions fees (usage).
Now Bitcoin overwhelmingly use inflation to pay for its POW and gradually switch slow to transactions.
Only when Bitcoin will have no more block reward than it will be inflation free.

I cannot pay for a $1001 flight ticket if my channel contain only $1000.
So I have to set a new payment channel with at least $1001 equivalent in BTC in it.




Where this cost come from?
Node so far are only using available ressources on my personal computer.
Processing, bandwidth and storage are already available, if you already got a PC and a stable internet connection.




Node cannot enforce permanent inflation (??)..


Indeed you are trusting other to validate and in case of a fork you might be connected to the wrong fork.
Note the it is the same with running a full node, in case of a fork you might connected to the wrong fork.
 


Yes with centralisation bitcoin doesn't work anymore. it has always been true.
But now imagine bitcoin is two order of magnitude bigger and run on 100MB blocks.. There will be many times more nodes on the network, not 100x more because there will more cost to run a node but easily 5 to 10x more.
I can see no scenario where node counts will drop to zero with large blocks, unless you are talking about GB blocks today??...


Non-optimal or not not you need to know the map to find a route.
Some routing algo has offered to use masternode (node that got full knowlegde of the network topology) that create trust issue and push the scaling difficulties to the masternodes (datacenters..)..


If routing fail to find a path, that mean your two node can't be connected, you are back to on chain payment. 
*(FLARE is probabilistic for example.. the only alternative to fail routing is opening a new channel.. you can already tell than FLARE cannot scale)*

This is impossible long term, cost has to be paid for, at a loss or not.
If you cost are below your gain, good for you but you still have to sell a significant part of your block reward to pay the bills.
The cost of Bitcoin POW directly creates selling pressure.
@_date: 2016-12-07 10:43:14


Well have you any Idea of the price of transaction fee you need if you want to price out all non monetary use? Like proof of existence?
I reckon even if fees were as high as $100 if it still a good deal.
The main reason why there isn't more of it in the blockchain, it is because people don't trust Bitcoin well enough for it.
Bitcoin will always be far cheaper than using a notary service.

Segwit increase the capacity 2x but allow for blocksize equivalent of 4mb.
Miner and node will always have to be able to deal with that excess bandwidth demand otherwise it creates an attack vector.
A clear block size increase to 2mb only allow 2mb block period.
Segwit increase capacity to 2mb and allow block up to 4mb.


Fair enough and I agree but they have yet to prove they are able to scale Bitcoin.
Therefore effort should be made to allow more capacity onchain until they are proven and viable solutions (and that's not even sure LN can scale Bitcoin and remain decentralised and trustless)


Absolutely not clear yet.
Routing payments channel in a trusted and decentralised manner has proven to scale very badly (same bad scaling as onchain tx)
The most advanced routing algo is probabilistic, meaning that it cannot guarantee being able to route your transactions.
Good luck scaling Bitcoin with that..


Totally agree a perfectly logical solution if LN has proven to scale.
I think nobody would argue with that.
Unfortunately so far LN can only scale with massive trade off.
(Probabilistic routing, centralisation..)


Decentralised and trustless Layer 2 scaling is still an unproven concept.
Nobody knows how to route payments in a decentralised and trustless manner.


It does if you create a specific block set of large multisig transactions typically in an attempt to attack the network.

No, in such case once BU get activated and the orphan period start for a month, all block that doesn't signals BU get orphaned forcing miner to upgrade otherwise they will loose their reward.
After a month BU client allows larger block.
I think it's called synthetic fork.. 


By adding a orphan period (a soft fork) you can force everyone to upgrade and avoid a fork.

You will be effectively creating another currency on a separate chain.
This is a misunderstanding to think all ASIC will be worthless in case of a PoW change. SHA256 miner will keep mining Bitcoin if Core decide to go on a separate chain therefore it will keep working just fine (they have too some miner have invested millions).
What you are talking about would be an event similar to ETH/ETC. I don't think it is a option.

The thing is going to low capacity cap is putting bitcoin in an uncertain economic model. This is not a conservative move.




You take an extreme to refute my position.
Node running on few datacenter worldwide would not be a suitable situation, obviously. *(may I remind you that it is the situation of mining currently.. so bitcoin can be reasonably describe a decentralised)*
But allowing bitcoin to grow will allow more people to join in, more business to join in, that will lead to more nodes..
More miner will want to join in, maybe helping shifting the balance so Chinese manufacturer will be better off selling more ASIC than mining on it.. that would be a very critical step..
A vastly bigger market cap, that would help prevent financial attack.. so far it will just take pocket change from Western Union or another Bank to completely kill bitcoin...
And more importantly with more growth more people can share the cost of the POW, making bitcoin closer to sustainable..
A bitcoin 10x or 100x will already start to be disruptive at a worldwide level and it will start politically incorrect to attack (because many people will benefit from it) 


I don't I don't have access to permanent internet due to my work so it is very difficult for me to run a node.
Yet I still have full access to bitcoin.


You can run a node without fiber, come on..


I know no countries where internet is not good enough to run a full node at least in the capital.. and I have been in Africa, eastern Europe and many part of Asia. 
(surprisingly Australia got the shitiest internet making hard to run a node there..)


I agree


I agree, but that a fight we cannot win if we stay small.
Have you any idea how easy it is to force KYC on miner?
It would be as easy as state that would be an extra 1BTC for every block miner complying to the rules they set up.
Any miner complain to KYC or whatever rule would get an extra 1BTC per block.. all the big mining pool and mining farm will complain obviously, noboby can afford to waste an 1 extra BTC..
Thanks to industrial and centralised mining such compliance would very easy and cheap to put in place..
Only with some mining decentralisation (and some small mining that have the balls to refuse the bride) that such attack become difficult.. (and with growth so that miner gain enough BTC to not care about the bride..)




I think people that defend 1MB are too short sighted, It is still unsure Bitcoin will be successful/sustainable long term. Limiting its growth so early seem very risky for me.




It is hard for me to talk about LN, it doesn't exist and there is still no know way to make it scale in a decentralised and trustless manner.
Meaning that it will be trap in the same censorship, regulation issue.
I see your point, I think your underestimate the fragility of bitcoin in the current state and as many people I talked in this forum, you see growth as an attack.. yet growth is critical for us.
Bitcoin need to be big to grow stronger.
Leave time to LN to develop, if it come as good as promised, great! but the wait might be very long..

If your transactions went from 1 confirmations to unconfirmed that mean your block was orphaned after your confirmation.
It is rare but it happen.

But as it is trustless and decentralised it can still be usefull I think.

I see this misconception very often.
Again the (hilarious) Adam Black twitter profile description misleads people.
Hashcash has literally nothing to do with a currency.
What hashcash do is take a set of data plus add some data to it then hash it **many times** until you got a hash that satisfy your target difficulty. (Below a preset value, the lower the harder)
When you computer have solve that PoW, you have a cryptographic proof that your computer have invested so a certain amount of computing power to solve it.
It was first design to prevent SPAM so that it will be prohibitively expensive to SPAM (each email had to have a PoW attached to it to be valid)
AFAIK it has never been widely used before Bitcoin.
**How does that anything to do with a currency??**
*(and BTW a currency has no inflation inflation control it is not a currency.. by definition)*


No hashcash is Bitcoin PoW.
The Bitcoin PoW is used to trustlessly timestamp transactions. This was  necessary breakthrough to create a decentralised cryptocurrency.
(The concept of PoW existed before hashcash, Satoshi used it Because is was already available and that avoid him to write once from scratch)
@_date: 2016-12-10 15:52:32
How surprising?
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:05:12


Why not keeping it as holding. If your mining is profitable you can sell for FIAT or as well keep it in a paper wallet..
I don't see why it would increases selling pressure.
The only bitcoin a miner **has to** sell is to pay for his cost.
The higher your cost, the more you have to sell. 


Not really for example a drop in price it might force many miner to sell more coins to cover thier cost leading to pushing further pushing the price down.
An increase in price give the chance to miner to sell less, leading to reduce the Bitcoin available to sell further pushing the price up..


You are confused between "price inflation" and "supply inflation"
Price inflation can go up and down for whatever reasons, Supply inflation increases every time a block reward is distributed.


Well we disagree, 
POW has a cost that is supported by **supply inflation** (block reward) whatever it lead to price deflation/inflation depends on many factors..

How node cost would increase mining centralisation?
&amp;gt;Basic economic say the opposite.


Or 5-10% more transactions with the same fee




It is raising so far unfortunately it is pretty useless so far, inflation pay for the PoW, 
It is raising to level  that support the PoW that is important, and that's another order of magnitude larger fees.
It is a crazy bet to bet everything on "Bitcoin will have enough demand enough $10 fee tx to support the network.."
This would require an immense growth.. on 1mb?? Come on!!
@_date: 2016-11-20 12:02:22

Obviously all the SHA256 miners will not gently stop mining and bitcoin will still be running if suddenly Core decided to implement change of the PoW, the result will be two different cryptos..

Nakamoto consensus was meant to mean 10.000 to 100.000 (mining) nodes need to agree to change the protocol.
We cannot be any further from that.
Now with mining centralisation and soft fork "tricks" it only take, what 20 maybe 10 persons to agree to change the protocol.
A level much closer to central planning than nakamoto consensus. From anarchy to political.

@_date: 2016-12-05 17:47:01


Yet using politics and dividing technics...
@_date: 2016-12-10 13:11:47


Well you don't need some kind orphaning tactics to ensure Bitcoin transactions complain with whatever KYC or AML a state want.
A government just have to pay say 1BTC to each block a miner produces that complain to a predifined set of rules.
This would be extremely cheap and easy to do for a gorvernement, it will not be 100% efficient but with time mining that don't respect the rules will be outcompeted by complaint miner. (This would also further increase centralisation)
I agree the only good defense any cryptocurrency can have against such attack is mining decentralisation (and a good share of miner not willing to take that extra money) and Bitcoin is not in the best position regarding that.
Note that changing the PoW is unlikely to fix that has government can just continue this attack on the new currency..
I don't think any transparent cryptocurrency can be called censorship resistant (unless there is some protocol rule that force miner to include tx? Another massive change on the protocol..)
I have some hope opaque blockchain can be censorship resistant, time will tell.


Those use are uninteresting to you, maybe not to other.
Personally a widely accepted Bitcoin would have been of great use for me as I travel a lot.. and no, there is no "centralised" alternatives work as good as Bitcoin when you have to deal with many currencies and travel for example..
But I have no doubt there are many great use of Bitcoin that not interesting to me either..
Speculative use appeal to most, I agree but Bitcoin can (and should) do more.


It sound difficult to argue that we are not under heavy governance? Why HK meeting for example if Bitcoin was only code?
Really you think there is zero level of politics in Bitcoin nowadays?


There is no guarantee it is a good thing.
Bitcoin could have become immutable with limitations that would prevent it from ever becoming sustainable (secure and remain **inflation free**)


Well the lack of growth in Bitcoin didn't help changetip, they were probably to early in the game.
I definitely some kind of similar service will exist in the future (and it was off chain..)


Bitcoin is certainly not a store value as long as its PoW is subsidized by inflation to the tune of 90+%
Once inflation would have stopped or become negligible (fee accounting for the largest part of the block reward) **and** Bitcoin would remain secure and useable then we can start talking about store of value.
As long as Bitcoin rely that much on inflation it remain an **experiment**
Building a currency that is not inflationary is extremely hard and Bitcoin has not yet to demonstrate it can be one.


Why? Those cryptocurrency will have more usage they might end by being more decentralised if widely used as well
That would make that currency more secure but also more liquid (more stable)..
And they will have speculative use too so there is not reason to believe they cannot be more valuable.
If that that new currency beat Bitcoin on every aspect, the market price should reflect that.


Well I did, I sold 9/10th of my Bitcoin when I realized it is becoming a different currency with a very different risk profil.
For example I believe if Bitcoin stay at 1mb there is no way fee can rise enough to support the PoW.
so I think there is real chance of Bitcoin will be forking in the medium/long term to increase inflation (block reward) in order to maintain an high enough level of PoW.
*(And Well inflation don't go very well with store of value)*


As for "Satoshi's vision", frankly, I do not worship him, and I do not care, but I do not think it is any far from what I exposed.
No I don't think it is a strawman, many small blocker think Bitcoin is broken and need fixing by human intervention..
Which is very different from what Satoshi intended and I invested in Bitcoin because of the Bitcoin white paper, not because of some mandatory to use 2nd layer solutions *(that have not even proven their ability to scale)*.
(I am not worshipping him, I have bought in thinking the economic characteristics of Bitcoin would be set in stone and now they are being radically changed)

LN cannot process 2000 routing request per second without putting an immense load on the network (scaling)
Routing will be the limiting factor of LN.

For Bitcoin to survive in such condition there need to be a huge demand for $10-$20 transactions..
It is still very much unclear there is enough peoples willing to pay $10-$20 transactions to fill 1mb block (300.000 tx a day..) in order to maintain a high enough level of PoW.
And that is not talking about competition from other altcoin.
While this scenario is certainly possible, it is not likely.. and would require a lot of growth..
@_date: 2016-11-28 20:25:01


Challenge are different for LN. See flare white paper.


No I don't.


Nothing wrong about that.
What I against is crippling Bitcoin while LN get finished.
It make Bitcoin a much riskier project as it rely on an unproven tech.


Growth can bring decentralisation back to Bitcoin.
Capacity onchain is critical for the fees to pay for the PoW long term.
1mb is not sustainable.

@_date: 2016-11-17 16:46:25
Not if you activate it as a soft fork by adding an orphan period. 
(All miner has to upgrade otherwise their block get orphaned, basically a soft fork before the hard fork activate)
@_date: 2016-12-07 11:09:03


SPAM on small block cost more per tx **but it take much less tx to arm the network** than on large block.
that's the point of the graphic.
Small block create another kind of SPAM attack weakness.
Well you can tell from all the post on this sub about SPAM attack.. that suggests small didn't stop SPAM attack and OP got an interesting point.

It **very** important Bitcoin keep a high level of PoW..
A lot of outdated ASICs are accumulating they could be used to attack Bitcoin at some point.


Lower miner income will contribute to mining centralisation.. because the little guys give up and that re-enforce the big ones.
@_date: 2016-12-14 08:32:22
Bitcoin will only be digital gold when its PoW will be supported by fee alone..
The PoW is now subsidized by inflation at level as high as 90+%
@_date: 2016-12-01 13:24:52
Scaling characteristics can be compared.
And flooding every channel would exactly as bad as main chain whatever you like it or not..
*(10x more LN will lead to 10x more bandwidth requirement on every channel)*
Bitcoin transactions are very compact already so that kind of strategy very well lead to an even larger bandwidth usage than on chain tx..
It would be nice to have to option to do it tough, as it would likely be the only 100% trustless and decentralised way to find a route.
@_date: 2016-11-10 04:40:41
Well with gold once the analysis is preformed you know what you got.

Currently you can buy tainted without any way of knowing it.. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 16:04:37
Sometimes the inability to change lead to critical failure..
For example at 1mb it is likely impossible fees will ever be able to support the PoW when block reward will disappear..
@_date: 2016-12-13 09:49:56




Yes but 100mb is not even datacenter level of equipment, high end computer and good internet connection can deal with it **TODAY**.
And that give us two order of magnitude growth and well enough capacity to pay for the PoW..




You have to ask a sever what part of the map you have to select to find a route.
The server can very reply to you by providing you only the part of the map containing hub the he controls.
This one issue that can arise with using trust when selecting a route.




Again it all depend strongly on how routing will behave, if it is probabilitic people will always choose the biggest and most connected hub.
Because everybody want the cheaper/more reliable routing..
Such scenario lead to strong centralisation with the obvious problem associated with..

Fee today: 20c multiple order of magnitude give this:
* 1 order of magnitude: $2
* 2 order of magnitude: $20
* 3 order of magnitude: $200
Well do you think bitcoin usage wouldn't be affected by such high fee?
And if with such high fees your biggest is still running a node.. well it is because you don't use bitcoin.
This is the sad thing people want bitcoin to only be a speculative asset.
I believe it could be much more than that, well I believed it before bitcoiner themselves fought to ensure bitcoin will never be anything else than that..


There is, without significant adoption fee will never be enough to sustain a high enough level of PoW when block reward will disappear.
Slowing down adoption might lead bitcoin to never be sustainable.
This is a major risk.




Absolutely, and the block limit is being used for "manipulate" bitcoin economics..

Thank for clarifying, my dirty quick calculation gave a bit more than $5 but around that figure too (well around $10)
It would be interesting to have a more serious calculation indeed..
It is still more than an order of magnitude bigger than now.
If there is enough demand for tx at more than an order of magnitude more expensive is still very an open question..

So you confirm there no weight limit in the consensus rules.
Weight is irrelevant, just semantic.
Only the 1mb matter to produce valid block.
And this is the limit that need to be lifted to increase capacity whatever segwit or not.
@_date: 2016-11-21 14:59:22
Indeed a 10x seem really disruptive to me too.
I think some compromise can be made to increase capacity and avoid such high on chain fee level while still keeping Bitcoin secure.
The transition from inflation-paid PoW to usage-paid PoW remain a big unknown for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-17 11:03:33


Well they do, a majority of miner can decide any protocol change whatever it is soft fork or hard fork change..

@_date: 2016-11-28 14:49:58

It is critical to get more capacity on chain for bitcoin to have any chance to collect enough fee to pay the PoW.
1MB is not sustainable.

@_date: 2016-12-12 16:03:27
It is unrealistic to say that LN can scale to billions of transactions a second.

Yet they appear as "anyone can spend" and they are unable to see the witness data. (to check the signature)
Old node are not better than SPV wallet for such transactions..
Major change.


Yes but it will still activate as a soft fork it would only take few miner to activate such change.
It take very few people to break Bitcoin immutability.


Nothing satoshi arranged here, if it is a soft fork once it activate (as long as the threshold is above 51%) it becomes the new rules. Other miner/nodes cannot do anything about it..


Just before you said if segwit activated by definition it would have consensus. Would you call 51% consensus?


Hard fork give all power to node operators, if they don't upgrade miner will mine invalid block.
Why is it not your favorite upgrade procedure?
It takes a shit load more people to activate a hard fork making impossible to push controversial change.
Soft fork, it takes only a few (tyranny of the minority)




Whatever you like it or not that's the way it is.


Nodes cannot see soft fork change.. this is why they are soft fork! Backwards compatible remember?
Nodes have ZERO power to prevent a soft fork only miner do.
Soft fork give all power to activate to Miner.
Hard fork give all power to activate to node operators.


If it is a soft fork, node can do fuck all.


Hahaa, didn't you just said miner have zero power??


Well they do, they could have voted for XT already a year ago and they voted to support CORE.
They have voted to keep small block so far.
Saying they have no power is **very** naive.


What is that power exactly?


Yes with BU miner (and node operators) get to choose the blocksize, it is a much better system than a arbitrary constant.
Not a selected few (tyranny of the minority).


How convient?
By the way.. Bitcoin rolled back its blockchain already once.. 


There is no other way, by definition backwards compatible change.. are compatible, 
Sigh... No Satoshi magic here.
@_date: 2016-11-27 13:39:11


Well it is clear. Miner will still mine sha256.
They have too, some have invested millions.
Bitcoin will simply continue as usual and Core will be creating a separate chain.


They will be free to do so, yet it will still be an altcoin.


There other, better way to implement scaling and malleability fix.

Well I note that you don't argue my point.
Routing can certainly be done with better scaling characteristics but not without tradeoff on decentralisation/reliability. (Ex: Flare)
Flooding all channel is exactly equivalent to flooding all node with onchain transactions.. it is not hard to understand you get the same scaling characteristics.
This is just a fact..

Well those can be fixed with some level of trust and centralisation..
But inefficiency are not necessarily a bad thing if they help the system achieve the level of trustlessness.


It is unlikely to be enough to find a route.


It is small, but keep in Mind Bitcoin transactions are very compact too.. yet we are facing scaling challenge..
And the network topology will be highly dynamic it is likely channel status will be requested for each payment requiring routing..
And you rchannel need to know at least the liquidity and each neighbor of each channel to find a routing..
That might very well take more data than a Bitcoin tx.
That why I think the fully trustless decentralised routing is not really possible..
@_date: 2016-12-12 17:50:04

Well Bitcoin PoW is paid by two things:
* Inflation (block reward, that mean holder pay for the network security by debasing the currency.)
* Usage (Tx fees, that mean user will pay for the network security by paying a fee each time they send a transaction)
Bitcoin inflation is scheduled in such way that inflation will disappear. (Every four years block reward half)
Bitcoin security will move to be entirely paid by inflation *(currently 90%+ of what miner get come from inflation)* to be paid entirely by usage.
This is a major shift!
* Big blocker want to support growth to allow usage to increase and help Bitcoin becomes sustainable (being secure and remain inflation free)
* Small blocker want to keep the blocksize limited to force the fee price up to make Bitcoin sustainable (tx fee need to raised by an order of magnitude).

It didn't increase the 21M cap in the same way segwit don't increase the blocksize..
It is just a matter of semantics but the network characteristics has permanently changed..
If playing semantics is all it take, you are to fool.


This is because soft fork don't need consensus, they need 95%.
That mean if three miners can reach 95% it takes three peoples to activate a soft fork! Central planner wet dream!!
Is three miners consensus of whole Bitcoin community??
Seriously this is comedy gold...You guys are unbelievable, you hate the miner.. yet you use the upgrade method that give FULL power to them!
And guys complain about large block yet freak out when a mining pool mine empty blocks..

Yes payment channel can do 200tps or even 2000tps without routing..

You need routing for LN to scale Bitcoin.
Maybe you start to get it?
@_date: 2016-12-12 18:24:02


Well it show that payment channel without routing are useless.
Instead of two transactions to open and close the payment channel the same can be achieved by only charging on Bitcoin payments at the end of the video.
Payment channel are are even lees efficient than regular tx as they require two tx, one to open and one to close the channel.
This is why routing is critical to LN and so far no routing algo can support 200tps in a distributed manner.
@_date: 2016-12-07 11:15:09
**If you reduce the fees for normal users, you reduce the fees for spammers too.**
I agree with that but in the same time you an increase the number of tx a SPAMMER has to send to hurt the network.
And small block it might take only a little amount of expensive fee during peak time to seriously increase the fee for everyone. Doing the same with capacity available on the network might be prohibitively expensive as you have to fill the block then create a backlog..
@_date: 2016-12-20 16:55:35

Without a high enough pevel of PoW a cryptocurrency as no value (it becomes unsecure because cheap to 51% attack)




Well you pay for PoW by devaluated the currency, yes.

This has not been demonstrated yet.


If fees are high why not put all your coin on your channel at once and save on fee.


Enough of those $300.000 tx to generate enough revenu for mining?




Yes I think miner might be at risk to not collect enough fee to secure the main chain.
Remember if bitcoin is worth 100x more, it is also 100x more attractive to attack.




Yes, I don't like "account trick" to go around consensus rules.
This is a dangerous slippery slope.




It is still not demonstrated that LN can scale bitcoin 10.000x **far** from it.




So we have to care about the peoples that don't even care enough about bitcoin toupgrading their nodes?


Being your bank come at a cost.
It is folish to believe bitcoin can be disruptive without coming at zero cost.
(It goes also for LN, it is naive to believe LN channel will not come at some cost..)
Mining revenue goes directly to securing the network.. you can 100.000 nodes around if you don't enough PoW your currency is worthless.




If is was an hard fork I would.

Whatever you can opt in or not the network characteristics has been permanently changed **irreversibly**. 


It take very little peoples to reach 95%.
Never heard of mining centralisation?
For all we know segwit stuck at 20% can only be blocked by 3-4 miners farm/pool operators.


Another minority that dictates the network characteristics change they see fit.
@_date: 2016-11-29 18:05:52
I am asking specifically for fungibility, how segwit help for that, all transactions are still transparent.
@_date: 2016-11-29 10:32:05
Well why would they have even bothered with an soft forked implementation of segwit (much more complex) if they planned an hard fork to larger block after.
That doesn't make any sense.
Obviously there is no hard fork planned otherwise they would have used to implement a simpler segwit implementation.
@_date: 2016-12-06 18:25:35

I don't really follow you there... layer talk I guess..


Ha! a bit technical talk...
Well you assume finding a route throughout the network come at "zero cost".
Obviously if routing came for free (like provided by a server that got complete network map in memory and find the path for you) then LN would be able to scale bitcoin immensely, no doubt.
It is how much routing will "cost" the network will determine how LN will be able to scale. 
It is routing itself that will have scaling challenge, not the payment channel part of LN.
Nothing is very controversial in what I say here.
@_date: 2016-12-04 20:32:44




For that to work you need between 1x to 3x more people to be willing pay $10 per transactions..
It can only happen if Bitcoin experiencing massive growth..
And there is competition outside, another cryptocurrency can be able to pay for more PoW while still keeping lower tx fee.. (AKA more capacity on chain)


Again that only good if Bitcoin is able to sustain a high enough level of PoW.. otherwise it is all meaningless if the network is not secure it cannot retain value..


Bitcoin is now able to be settlement money now by being subsidized up to 90% by inflation...
It is absolutely unclear it can remain secure and inflation free on 1MB..
@_date: 2016-12-18 16:51:14




Soft don't produce invalid block to old nodes, that's why node are powerless regarding soft fork activation.
Block were valid before and block is valid after the soft fork, if not it is an hard fork.


If they have no power why mining centralisation is dangerous? Why 51% attack is a threat? Why are you begging them to activate segwit and interestingly enough if those powerless miner refuse to do so **there is nothing you can do about it!**
That suggests they are indeed powerful.




No precisely 51%.
Your are guaranteed to produce the longest chain over the long term **including variance** otherwise that mean you don't have 51% of the hash rate.
It will just have more orphaned block (the block that don't follow the new rules) at 51% than at 95%.


Such block will be orphaned if it doesn't fit the new soft fork rules followed by the 51%.


To a miner not aware of the new rules it will just appear to him that his block get always orphaned (as long as the violate the new soft fork rules) no much danger here..
&amp;gt; Hahaa, didn't you just said miner have zero power??


I am speechless, I think you deeply misunderstand blockchain cryptocurrency.




They see them and those blocks will be valid.
For a node following old rules there is no upgrade needed, nothing as changed, valid block before then valid block after.
Otherwise it would be an hard fork.


&amp;gt; Soft fork give all power to activate to Miner.


Yes and no, a soft fork to 300kb block would not even require a single code change or upgrade to anyone.




Many hard fork has been successfully performed in many cryptocurrencies and it is mostly an non-event. (Unless politics.. you guys looove politics)


&amp;gt; Saying they have no power is very naive.


Yet they have decided the blocksize: 1mb
And they keep doing so now by choosing not to activate Segwit: still 1mb
You want segwit and 2mb? The powerless miner are saying no and 1mb it is.
They are in command of the block limit (and have been surprisingly conservative IMHO)


Are they? Isn't the economic majority saying "activate segwit" and it seems they are saying no? 
And most importantly, how do you fire miner without creating another currency?
They will certainly not stop mining bitcoin will remain unaffected!
I for one will be celebrating such day!
Bitcoin core going on a separate chain and creating an altcoin will be great because will give Bitcoin the possibility to return to its fundamental and not the whole small block and Million TPS LN non-sense..
I definitely buy back some Bitcoin if that happen (Bitcoin original not the separate currency!)




A soft fork will follow those rules, but it can add some more and you have no power over that. (Miners do)


Like the 20.000tps promised by LN? Hahaa




So you confirm immutability is just about the ledger and not about the economic characteristics of Bitcoin.
Economic characteristics of Bitcoin are free to change as long as it takes soft forks and miner activate? Is it correct?

@_date: 2016-12-31 15:28:54


No we already talked about it.
There was an intuition that PoW (not specially Hashcash, any PoW) could be used to control inflation by making it (computationally) hard to create new currency.
This approach was a dead end.
What Satoshi did is use PoW to reach consensus. (The chain with the most PoW invest in it is the only valid one)
The inflation control and double spend protection come from every reaching consensus using the same rules.
This approach was so new many took years to understand/believe it works. (The most notorious is Adam Black but there is many other)
A PoW is not a currency, it is a tool to evaluate to amount of computational power you spend (trustlessly).

@_date: 2016-11-28 16:08:26
What make you think they are making irrational decision?
They have invested huge amount of money in bitcoin. If some have decided to to signal Segwit they certainly have a good reason.
I doubt hurting bitcoin is one of them.
@_date: 2016-11-27 11:04:07
Segwit can lead to block up to 4mb.
Not that segwit lead equivalent capacity of 1.7-2mb the 4mb can only be tjat large on purpose and doesn't lead effective capacity.
@_date: 2016-11-28 16:52:17
Well I can't talk for the miner,
But some have said that they worry that segwit will be the only capacity increase onchain.
@_date: 2016-12-13 11:46:50
It is not in their interest to not include transactions, they loose on fees..
They have produced many empty due to infrastructure upgrade,
Well that's what they say anyway.
@_date: 2016-12-16 21:27:45


No increase capacity and growth will increase decentralisation.


Yes they will and they absolutely should!!
Only if **Bitcoin work while miner are trying to game it to their advantage** that the Bitcoin experiment is successful.
Otherwise that mean Bitcoin need central planning and a punitive authority to work.
In that case we would have gain nothing from central banking because we are back to a trusted system.
And Bitcoin would have failed.


You are **VERY** naive is you think large block is the only thing miner can do to harm the network.


Well, I am very much positive on that move so I would not call a poor decision.
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:11:56
Or maybe you have no clue?
@_date: 2016-12-12 16:12:52


Well if fee drop onchain due to LN, ALL miner will have a strong incentive to delay or not even refuse to include LN open/closing transactions..
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:11:44
This has nothing to do with what I said.

I am not sure if you are talking about me but I am not Jihan Wu.
@_date: 2016-12-08 10:28:19
How come?
Changing PoW will put you in a separate chain.
Obviously all sha256 miner will keep mining they have bills to pay so Bitcoin will still work just fine while a separate currency run by core will be created.
@_date: 2016-12-05 10:55:15
And the level of PoW too.
@_date: 2016-12-01 14:48:31
Well you only know that your transaction is valid until it is included in a block.
@_date: 2016-12-06 18:07:42




Did you look at the link?
The arguments is: It take much less transactions to arm the network on small block than on large block.
To the point it is cheaper to SPAM the network on small block.
@_date: 2016-12-22 16:36:18
If there is a limit on weight it is possible to build a block that is valid on old node and invalid on segwit node.
Such block would create a fork.
@_date: 2016-12-20 16:12:44
Because there is no work there.
@_date: 2016-11-16 11:41:38


Well this is mostly what building bigger building and rocket are about.
That why rockets are as big as building and no 100kg rocket can reach the moon, 
And Bitcoin will need bigger block than 1MB if it want to have any important economic role in the future.
@_date: 2016-11-27 22:14:33
Lucky UTXO a bigger bottleneck than bandwidth.. oh wait..
@_date: 2016-12-31 17:51:08


I totally agree, yet that doesn't make hashcash a currency you would agree?




Indeed hashcash use "economic" analogy but is it enough to demonstrate it is a currency?
What if hashcash was called "cryptohash" and token was called "solution" the  "VALUE()" called "TARGET()" then would "cryptohash" still be a currency in the same way hashcash is?
Is it all about name?
 
@_date: 2016-12-20 16:17:51
More usage equal more fees to pay the PoW.
It is critical that the PoW is  well funded for Bitcoin to have any chance to be gold 2.0,
Otherwise the only alternative to pay for the PoW will be inflation.. inflation don't fit well with a store of value.
@_date: 2016-12-22 07:24:54
So exceeding the weight limit will mean a block will be invalid on new node but valid on old node.
This is an hard fork.
BTW a comment from Gmax that states that the good old 1mb block limit is here to protect the network against UTXO bloat after segwit activation..
So who is right you or Gmax?
@_date: 2016-12-09 13:41:24
I do very much agree than mining centralization come from "a credit bubble" much more than any other factor.. (block size for example)
Your experience is interesting, I don't know how it relate to bitcoin though as overproduction is impossible with Bitcoin.  


Then what kind of time frame is short term for you?


Well they invested in bitcoin, heavily.. much more than the vast majority of bitcoiner.
For example, some core dev have said they owned little to no BTC, that would make them less trustworthy IMO.
@_date: 2016-12-06 22:16:55
By how much?
Do you send two time more tx when fee are two time lower?
@_date: 2016-12-13 18:01:09
Well will see if LN has no externalize cost..
@_date: 2016-12-14 17:17:10




Well it might better not to fix it, if it make the system more trustless.




Sorry I misunderstood what you said.
I think it is similar the FLARE approach, probabilistic routing.




The challenge will be to keep that live update.
Remember the recording history of bitcoin is not the bottleneck, hard drive space is cheap and node can be pruned.
 




No because you cannot know what change will happen.
The "map" is only usable a the time the routing is made.




It is not a challenge, but it will take some data, repetitively each time a routing is requested..
So the more data it takes the more difficult the scaling.




No you don't need but that wasn't a bottleneck for onchain tx either..




Well the fully trustless and decentralisated routing scale like onchain tx (flooding routing request to all channel, just like flooding all tx to all nodes) so if we can imagine scaling will have similar ceiling..
For example 5000 channels and 100TPS (with routing) would put a huge constrain on the network..
Every channel get 100 routing requests a second..
@_date: 2016-12-06 18:13:39




Well the segwit chain can end up taking more data to a full validating node.
The 2mb chain will only allow block up to 2mb.
The segwit chain can allow block up to 4mb.. it all depend on the size of the witness data.
@_date: 2016-12-17 13:29:39
Unfortunately it can easy be gamed..

LN would terrible for me while I am traveling.
I cannot know the amout of Bitcoin I need to spend in advance.
I would need to lock something in the range of $1000-$2000 ... for LN to be useful to me in most case..


Then what is the purpose of those meeting?


No mining **fee** income need to increase.


Making Bitcoin more expensive to use now limit growth.
A huge growth is necessary for fee to pay the PoW (whatever it is on small block or not)


Is ripple more useful than Bitcoin?


Well again sidechain are not trustless..
And for example sidechain cannot be use increase fungibility (because Bitcoin is not, moving coin your coin form Bitcoin to a fungibile sidechain would "tain" your Bitcoin and make them less valuable) so sidechain cannot fix all Bitcoin flaws.


Blockchain space is only scarce is Bitcoin got no competition.


What are those evidence?


Precisely the opposite,
The block limit was added after as a temporary and was not part of the economic characteristics of Bitcoin.
This limit was meant to be lifted.
Forcing this limit on Bitcoin will fundamentally change it. It is human intervention.


The block size as an economic regulation tool was not part of the original Bitcoin experiment.
It make Bitcoin a much more risky project.
(As it has to rely on unproven tech to be sustainable)


Is it not catastrophic if 1mb can generate enough fee to pay the PoW. (And 2nd layer can scale)


I am not advocating for all transactions in the world should be on chain, I am advocating for enough capacity onchain to pay for the PoW.
What make you think those 2nd layer would not require datacenter to provide capacity? (aKA centralised)
Nobody is able to tell what scaling characteristics those 2nd layer have.
That tell a lot.

@_date: 2016-11-28 18:47:06


Well enormous tradeoff has to be made regarding routing (some level of centralisation, probabilistic).
It's unclear if it is even possible to make a decentralised, trustless routing and that has serious implications on LN.
@_date: 2016-12-12 15:59:11
Well if LN transactions are so successful to the point it reduces miner revenue what prevent miner from not including closing/opening LN transactions in their block?
@_date: 2016-12-06 22:23:19
Thanks for your knowledgeable input.
@_date: 2016-12-06 22:54:54


No my main concern is giving asymmetrical advantage to SPAMMER.
I am in all honesty in favor of larger block than 4mb (if the market decides).


Well miner has control already, if you cannot trust them with the blocksize how can you trust them to build the blockchain?


I am not arguing for the market value, I am arguing against market manipulation and capture.. and I hope for anyone to see that growth is needed to support the blockchain PoW long term.
But to be honest To my surprise somehow Bitcoin user seem to care little about the long term.


I am not,

@_date: 2016-11-28 17:37:53

I wish Bitcoin should be allowed to grow until LN is ready.
LN seems to have significant scaling challenge that are being overlooked and it might very well not be able to deliver the scaling expected.
@_date: 2016-12-16 20:45:27
I don't think so.. variance would have a much larger effect, we can tell looking at segwit vote variance is up to 5-10%..
Mining empty block can only reduce your Risk of being orphaned.. and the is about one block orphaned per day..
Much better for this miner to just wait variance to help him go beyond the activation threshold.
@_date: 2016-12-12 17:48:53
Well you can already do that.
Payments channel are already available, if such high frequency helped scale the network we would already.
Nearly nobody use them.
@_date: 2016-11-23 12:39:23
Well yeah that's a big issue with mining nowadays.
Some speculate that ASIC improvement are plateauing and that might give a chance for decentralisation to increase again.

Bitcoin blockchain is the most expensive digital storage there is, even before the fee market (in the range of $10.000 to $100.000 per GB)
It **never** maid sense to use the blockchain for storage.
Edit typo
@_date: 2016-12-22 08:39:54
So there is still the 1 mb block after activation, why trying to deny that?
@_date: 2016-12-12 18:59:50


So if you can calculate the cost of running your node, how much doubling the block size would increase your node cost?
x1.5, x2, x4?


If there is a consensus bug in Bitcoin core and Bitcoin fork your node can be on the chain that will disappear when the fork resolve.


At such block size (50mb) many internet connection in many place in the world allow independent people to run node (**today**)..
The blockchain will still be verified independently by a huge amount of peoples (I would argue a lot more than now)


I would predict the number of nodes will keep dropping massively over time if we stay on 1mb.
There only so much demand for node worldwide for a speculative asset..


Anyway if exchange are outsourcing node now, it is not because of the cost of it.


You will need to ask someone that know what submap you need to use (masternodes..*trust*)




Yes, and requiring channels status is what creates scaling challenges.




Yes if the network is centralised routing scale.
EDIT: will only *require to be processed* by **some** small set of nodes; I do not imply that it would be *the same* set of nodes in all the transactions.
How you select a limited number of channel trustlessly? 


This is will indeed create strong centralisation force.
@_date: 2016-12-06 22:21:15

In a sense the Satoshi breakthrough s very similar to Einstein breakthrough with relatively.
Einstein invented nothing all the concept needed for the theory of relativity to be discovered existed for a long time before Einstein made his breakthrough.
He just put together concepts that peolpes thought was incompatible and combine them in a way nobody thought about. 
(E=mc2 can be deducted from the maxwell equation that predate Einstein)
Satoshi also took a completely different approach than anyone instead of using PoW to directly regulate inflation, he used it to trustlessly timestamp transactions (then inflation control and double spend protection come for free) and that was the breakthrough needed to make cryptocurrency work.
I consider Satoshi very a much genius (Like Einstein was) as even people involved in cryptocurrency for years have been unable to succeed.
Yet even when Bitcoin was out and running it took some long time to even believed it worked (Adam Black for example!)
@_date: 2016-12-31 18:57:53
Then why doesn't work as a currency directly then?
You say it fit key features of a currency and anyone can trustlessly verify the value(cost?) of a hash, then it should a least work as a decentralised currency even is poorly, isn't it?

Hard to tell yet LN is not completely fully defined,
But for example a little LN hub might take lot of bandwidth/processing ressources with being rarely chosen to route a payment.
Decentralised system are inefficient.. there will be wasted ressources with LN too.

Many years passed without anyone of them been able to make any progress in the right direction.
If anything it kinda show that they would never be able to come with the breakthrough Satoshi did.


White paper have standard format..


Indeed.. none of these give even an indication of it..


Well the fact that my login contain Ant is enough for conclude that I am a Chinese miner is what I found hilarious personally..


If true then Bitcoin is under central planning, it is a failed project.

A valid chain without PoW is useless.
If PoW will have move to another chain that your node cannot recognize there is no much you can do.


In the case of soft it is even worst, nodes will not even notice the change, even if the rule have permanently changed.
@_date: 2016-12-21 06:06:49
No this is the whole purpose of Segwit signature data are not included in block space anymore.

@_date: 2016-12-13 18:08:16




I never said that, I said due to mining centralisation we are in the situation to trust miner..
Miner are a trusted third party until we gain more decentralisation (and that a bad situation).


I argue growth will bring more decentralisation..
@_date: 2016-12-20 15:03:28


Wich one they are?
@_date: 2016-12-14 08:30:08


How can you know?
LN is not fully defined yet..
If routing is decentralised some routing will be send to channel that will no be selected to route the payments, isn't it? So LN channel will for the most part processing routing request without being selected for a path.. this is wasted ressources.. 
This is due to the very nature of decentralisation, the only way to avoid that is sending the routing request to a server that now the network topology (centralisation, trust)
If for example routing requests were send to every channel to be sure you found a route trustlessly then you got the same scaling characteristics as onchain tx (onchain all tx are flooded to every node)
@_date: 2016-12-31 09:37:34


That definition fit Einstein too very well.
@_date: 2016-12-06 22:34:07

@_date: 2016-11-26 12:08:32
Well in all honesty they kinda do.
That's why mining decentralisation is critical.
@_date: 2016-11-27 22:40:32
And I hope a large enough number of nodes will be available with the segregated witness to upload..
Otherwise at some it will get difficult to sync new full validating node to the network...
@_date: 2016-12-08 20:18:55




The cost running a node is negligible compare the the cost of buying and running ASICs.
&amp;amp;gt;Or 5-10% more transactions with the same fee
Sorry typo, I meant 5-10x more tx.
Yes it to remian at that price it would require growth, In a same way a block full of $10tx would require growth (lot ot it!)


The level of proof of work has to stay high. If it drop that mean the security of Bitcoin drop.. to the point it might be possible to use old ASICs to attack the network.


I agree, and lt might be very difficult to achieve enough growth to generate that demand.
The way I support larger block and growth.
@_date: 2016-12-07 15:50:59
Who take the wait and see approach?
Soft fork are **only** validated by miner.. they are the only one that activate it.

@_date: 2016-12-20 17:21:13


This assume those 2layer solutions can scale Bitcoin with zero cost or tradeoff.
This is rather naive IMHO.


I believe they do.
If LN come as good as promised the whole Bitcoin ecosystem and economy will move to it, seriously reducing miner income and that's critical for Bitcoin security.


Not all transactions has to be on chain.
I only ask for enough capacity onchain for the fees to have any chance to support the PoW long term.


No, more capacity will lead to more growth and more growth will lead to more nodes.


I agree.
Not increasing the block size is also a tradeoff, putting at risk long terms security.


It will also help spread the cost of PoW amoung more people, increasing the likelihood of Bitcoin staying secure while staying inflation-free over the long term.

@_date: 2016-12-07 15:02:45
**We don't "trust" miners to build the blockchain.**  We require proof of work.
PoW is trustless.
What go in the block is not.
This is why it is critical to have some mining decentralisation.
Currently mining can include no tx in block it will still be a valid block.
Miner (and that the scary part with mining centralisation) can include only KYC compliant tx: it will still be a valid block. (AKA tx censorship)
Decentralisation was a major part of p2p ecash without **trusted** third party.


No that's wrong we already talked about it.
Without PoW it would be impossible to order transactions trustlessly.
(Syncing node would have no way to prove that block 1200 go after block 1199)


I recommand you read that link:
The proof of work is used to solve the byzantine general problem.
This is what made cryptocurrency possible.
Using PoW to make a block difficult to found was proposed very early after Hashcash was published. (You even linked a discussion with Peter Todd and Adam Black proposing the approach.. and that lead to.. well nothing)


And you forget the critical part: step (0) take hash of the previous block.
Without that the block is not part of the **chain** of work.
A syncing node would never find a valid place for it in the chain.


No without PoW a syncing would be unable to trustlessly check the order of block and unable to know what is the longest/valid chain


With mining centralisation, you still have to trust what they include in each block.
A block full of KYC compliant transactions is still a valid block.


Why? They are the most invested and they will be the one loosing the most if Bitcoin die.


This is the problem.
Most of the Bitcoin problems get solve by decentralisation of mining.
It is not a trivial problem to solve.
Clearly not one the people in charge are able to solve for sure.


You misunderstand the Bitcoin game theory, the system work best by every player looking for its best interest.
So nothing wrong with that.


Open source is a necessary step but insuffisant.
I firmly agree with you on that and the only way to remove trust is by competition.
There should be more than one team.
Keep one dev team genuis or not, is asking for trouble.


I agree but in all honesty the average Bitcoin user has lost is voting power **long** ago.


Well if they have invested millions there are in for the long term. Much more than anyone else in Bitcoin.


I consider the current situation as trusted.
Mining is too centralised to be trustless.


Maybe the market will reward if the upgrade the block size. How can you know?
I certainly think so.
Theymos himself is saying that staying at 1mb forever is a bad idea.
@_date: 2016-12-06 21:02:48

@_date: 2016-12-23 04:06:27
I provided you one, if there is a weight limit this can create a fork. (How come old node know if a block is invalid if they cannot see the weight limit)
@_date: 2016-12-07 14:20:46




I agree that's why I think this usage cannot be priced out.




There is no problem to solve here, if people start to trust the blockchain for that usage.. such transactions will increase massively whatever the tx fee..
(Well I think that a good thing has it help paying more PoW and incentives more archive nodes)
If non-monetary use is currently low on the blockchain it is not because of the high fees, it is because it is still an unproven concept.




Well if they are only prunned node on the network it is impossible for new node to sync up.
The least archive nodes there is the harder it is for new node to sync up. (There is so much upload bandwidth got every archive node)

Yes, beyond certain level of centralisation mining become a trusted third party absolutely.


No we should not have to trust the miner.
With enough decentralisation you would not have to.
That doesn't change the fact that I think miner are trustworthy. 
It Bitcoin die they go bankrupt that a pretty good incentive to not mess up with the currency.






Miner interest are my interest too, this a key reason why Bitcoin works.

I took no assumptions on price I said: 
If it take 10x more tx to jammed the network, unless the tx fee is more than 10x cheaper each than this attack will be more expensive.
Ex: 1mb tx fee:$10
Tx to jam the network : 100 tx
Cost to SPAM the network $1000
Ex2: 2mb tx fee:$1.5
Tx to jam the network : 1000tx
Cost to SPAM the network $1500
Edit clarity
@_date: 2016-12-11 20:33:07


&amp;gt; I cannot know the amout of Bitcoin I need to spend in advance.
&amp;gt; I would need to lock something in the range of $1000-$2000 ... for LN to be useful to me in most case..


Well of I have less than $1000, I will have to close and re-open a new channel.
This start to be a lot of money permanently on a hot wallet..




In this context it would make sense.
Other than that miner should stay as independent as possible.




Not true, total fee income can drop if there no enough for transactions tx at double the price.




How much cost you to run a node?
It come for me at $0.


There is little trust on running a SPV wallet.
To get tricked you need an attacker to place a fake transaction and build  six confirmations on top of it.
This would require a huge computational power this the same trust model as running a node, you trust that nobody evil will use large computational power to attack the network.




My point is on usefulness.
The more useful a currency is the more valuable it will become.




So far I am only aware of federated sidechain.




The blockchain itself will have evidence that you moved value to a private sidechain, those coin will be tainted.




Indeed if you believe Bitcoin has no competition, I understand yoir point of view.
I don't believe so.
For example some cryptocurrency offer fungibility and capacity onchain and that's two point Bitcoin cannot compete with.




If you read Satoshi post it is crystal clear Bitcoin wasn't meant to work on small block.


It only had significant economic influence since 


You channel still need to collect some more data to calculate a path (liquidity, neighbors, fee) those characteristics are constantly changing..
So they have to be updated form every transaction that need routing, and for routing to be trustless your node need to know the status of all channels.
Interestingly enough, this have the same characteristics as scaling on chain (routing request are flooded to all channels in the same way transactions are flooded to every node)
@_date: 2016-11-29 17:32:41
@_date: 2016-12-07 15:41:10


Well if transactions cost a million dollars it would take several Billions to SPAM the network. Ok.
Now double the block size then it take ten time more tx to SPAM the network.
For this attack to cost the same thing you would the tx fee to drop by 10x. It is not rocket science.
So unless doubling the block size drop the fee by more than 10x it is cheaper to SPAM Bitcoin on 1mb than on 2mb.
@_date: 2016-12-31 14:56:16

Each order of magnitude growth in transactions fee would require an immense growth, all that growth for a speculative assets only??




I hear that a lot, but honestly what making Bitcoin transactions uncensorable?
What prevent government from paying miner that includes only KYC compliant tx?
They are still free to include any transactions they want in a block and transactions are transparent..


Are you implying the only use of Bitcoin are illegal..
Why did you invest in it then?
*A speculative assets with some illegal use, what's not to love?*
I had many *legal* use of Bitcoin as I travel a lot, Well before before the community decided to only allow speculative use..


Yet we very much have charismatic leaders and governance..


That would require massive growth, 
Unclear if possible on 1mb.


Well where are we going for if not Paypal2.0?


Is it not what happening now?
People took advantage of that temporary limit to "turn evil" and change Bitcoin economic.. this indeed central planning I agree.


Hard to tell for sure, see circle BTC closure.


What if they end up being more valuable because they are supported by more usage?
Then they might become a better store of value and well why even bOther with BTC anymore?


It is not that simple.


This also one big difference between large blocker and small blocker, well.. you guys are very much in favor of central planning.
This is another big departure from Satoshi original vision.
@_date: 2016-12-18 05:47:21

What is a compelling reason to SPAM and why did it appear in the last year?
The only change happening to the network during the last is full blocks.
Is full block make it more compelling reason to SPAM? 
That tend to suggest OP is right.




Then if it drop by more than 10x it is cheaper to SPAM the blockchain on 2MB.

Well you know the cost of layer/notary service... to force people to condense such usage transactions fee will have to be around $1000 (more than $500 at least I would say)
Below that the blockchain is a immense bargain..
*(I never thought of that but that might even price out monetary use of Bitcoin at that level if that end up take a large share of the block size..)*




Well it is vicious circle,
Say now there is just enough archive node to support new syncing node.
Now divide it by two.
Now the lasting archives node get under high load to service the new syncing nodes, forcing more user to stop running them due to raising cost. (High upload bandwidth demand)
Now you get an ever diminishing number of archive under increasing work load.. at that stage syncing new node will probably much more difficult/long..




I certainly don't see that as a problem we need as much tx fee as possible to pay for the PoW, as inflation will gradually stop paying for it.
@_date: 2016-11-22 15:57:30

Hashcash is a PoW algo, this is literally what hashcash is.
The concept of PoW pre-date hashcash.




All PoW algo are trustless.
They provide a trustless cryptographic proof that some computational power has been spend.
Otherwise it is no a PoW algorithm.


But it could have been another one.
(People have talked about forking Bitcoin to change the PoW for example to get a more ASIC resistant PoW algo)


Please give me an example of a centralised and trusted PoW if such a thing exist..


I don't deny that.
The decentralised and trustlessness don't come from hashcash, it come from using a PoW algorithm.
So example of PoW algo:


It does, 
It is not an oversimplification it was an immense breakthrough! 
It was thought for decades to be impossible problem to solve.
Greg Maxwell even publish an article proving it was impossible.
The PoW is used for that, node know what is the valid chain by connecting to the blockchain with the most PoW invested in it.
This is the breakthrough that made decentralised cryptocurrency possible.

It is unclear if such event will lead to a 50% drop in price.
We will only know few weeks/months after the market stabilize.
Impossible to tell which fork will retain more value.
But it is very possible original Bitcoin (sha256) will retain more value, most of the people are not even aware of the blocksize crisis so a separate chain from Bitcoin core dev will likely go unnoticed by many.. and original Bitcoin will remain the most **secure** for many years even if the Bitcoin altchain with a different POW is very successful.
And it is also unclear 50% drop is such a problem for miner.. they have experienced such drop many times in Bitcoin history.
Much better than loosing their all investment by turning off their ASICs


The issue is block limit increase are more difficult if Segwit activate.
*With a 1mb limit it allows block up to 4mb, (for 1.8mb effective capacity increase).. that mean if the block limit increase to 8mb the network have to able to handle 32mb (for likely a 12mb effective capacity)*


Well enormous compromise has been made.. all the way down to 2mb to  give Bitcoin some capacity while other solutions (LN) were under development.
IMO Segwit as an hard fork + 2MB limit would have been the best compromise for now


In all honesty Bitcoin has already been seriously hurt.
I don't think it is possible for the community to back together again.

What are the benefits of mining empty block?
Why it is not a great news for you? Reduce blockchain bloat, increase security, increase fee pressure, increase decentralisation.
Why are you not celebrating empty block?


I am, **as every Bitcoiner are**
There basic fundamentals of (blockchain) cryptocurrency that you don't understand.
You are so strongly convinced that miner want to destroy Bitcoin that you cannot even imagine anyone defending miner as corrupt.
Bitcoin as any blockchain based cryptocurrency rely on miner and user incentive being strongly aligned. 
(And even more so if Bitcoin scale offchain)
If you believe miner are a threat to the network you should sell your BTC and invest in a blockchainless cryptocurrency.
I say that in all honesty, I would sell everything if I thought Bitcoin mining incentives were not working anymore.
(Part of the reason why I sold most of mine is mining centralisation BTW that make Bitcoin not trustless anymore)
Look at Tangle of Maidsafe.


Sorry to break the news to you, there are.
For example they can mine empty blocks, those blocks will be valid block.


Fundamentals feature of cryptocurrency: miner has incentive to not hurt the currency.
Cryptocurrency 101.

Ok, 
I might not be using the proper term.


Because Bitcoin becomes less self suffisant, 
The more nodes there is, the more resilient the network becomes.
Decentralisation (node/mining) is a key feature of Bitcoin, well any relevant cryptocurrency.


Basic economic say the opposite.


How can you tell, limted block size may have limited growth (while we still have the block reward to help support it).
@_date: 2015-08-27 14:59:23


Centralisation risk of big block are due to reducing full node, unrelated to mining.


-Solo mining you run a full node. (so bigger block might impact you)
-Mining pool you send your hash power to the pool. (so block size don't matter to you)
Some have argue that big block can be use to outcompete small miner, as small use mining pool it as no effect on them.
Mining is already centralised close to his maximum (being one pool at 51%) even if 1MB block.
The mining centralisation as started well before, for different reason that blocksize.

I agree storage should not be an issue.
But Segwit tend to encourage that kind of data prunning.. increasing the bandwidth demand on the archive nodes as there will be less of them (less nodes able to service the syncing node), further increase the incentive to not operate such node...

Indeed if your Us citizen you should wait a bit before starting a LN hub..
Privacy will be an issue. your buying history will be very valuable.
And LN hub has to get bigger to generate more income, there will be a push to centralisation.
All that is ok is there is a choice and your are not forced to use LN.
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:24:56
I was pretty much ok with whatever the network will choose between bitcoin core or XT (with a preference for bigger block but no drama otherwise)
But following this week end event.. And after the front page completly clean of any pro-XT post (but somehow still ok with post bashing XT) and the post from adam3us saying that he is willing to sabotage the fork a great risk to severely damage bitcoin as a all!!!!
That is it, it is insanity! 
Now I thing bitcoin has to move the influence of fews toxic people.. And so XT is the only way forward..
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:58:46
I did think about that,
Still it would take 100's of blocks full of Tx for a long time! That would one hell of an expensive attack (assuming all Tx got fees)

Bitcoin XT is an alt-coin?
How come 1mb Bitcoin not being an alt-coin then?
As it will fundamentally change the use and purpose of bitcoin.
(rely on third party off chain Tx, high fees, side chain and lightning network to scale)
I think everybody agree that the most change to bitcoin would to stick to 1mb am I wrong? 
@_date: 2015-08-10 04:10:03
This my thinking now, better safe than sorry,
@_date: 2015-08-17 03:55:54
I guess only a dynamic block size could follow that kind of growth,
But beyond what any node would be able to deal with..
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:26:54
I agree too,
Thanks I will look at it,
@_date: 2015-08-26 12:05:41
I would be worry of the opposite case,
If one mining pool with 20%+ hash rate can decide to reduce the block size at will.
Whatever one can think that's good or bad, that give a lot of power (centralisation..) to one pool.
And a new kind of attack... 21% attack.
Let's say that are in china.. bandwidth is expensive..lets slow down all bitcoin because I don't feel like investing..
@_date: 2015-08-24 08:44:52
Are you arguing that current mining centralisation are due to the actual blocksize?
You know that sending you hash to a mining pool provide you with more stable income..
This only is the main cause of centralisation: convinience,
Solo mining without a really significant amount of hash power you wil have wait quite some time to get your block reward..
For 1Th/s it will take four months to get a block.
And one a side node bandwidth cost are negligeable compare to the ASIC investement to get into mining nowaday.
@_date: 2015-08-17 07:26:04
With rigidity to change from bitcoin may well make altcoin look very attractive,
Fungability and privacy need a big fix in Bitcoin, and will likely never be fixed,
Some altcoin using ring-signature are up and running..
Saying to altcoin are useless is not being well informed,
@_date: 2015-08-25 19:40:58
It's the pool decision to go BIP100, then the people that send their hash can decide to stay and support BIP100 ot leave and support something.
It's good all pool should stand what is thier opinion and then people will decide to send their where they want.
@_date: 2015-08-28 06:10:40
Indeed LN if up and running now would likely not help at all as the current average use of bitcoin is far away from the LN sweet spot. (Frequent spending of small amount)
@_date: 2015-08-10 03:58:32
I feel increasigly weird about bitcoin and the bitcoin community, I am for the first time reducing my bitcoin holding..
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:35:40
I would think something with like:
Average size of the last 1000 blocks + 30% (or 10 or 20%..)
Recalculated every blocks,
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:05:58
Mining pool are the number one push for centralisation, 
Without them we would have much less centralisation push.
If everyone were solomining whatever your hash/rate the situation woulb waaay different.
Let me know what is the third way, I would like to know,

@_date: 2015-08-21 09:25:53
Absolutly not.
And both are needed for bitcoin to scale.
My understanding is some people want to keep 1mb block to push the use and adoption of LN as it will be the only way to scale and make more profitable as It will be the fee will increase dramaticaly.
In that scenario.. Bye bye any other use of the blockchain,
@_date: 2015-08-19 12:05:03

@_date: 2015-08-20 14:57:03
Agree and the current usage of bitcoin doesn't fit the "sweet spot" of LN,
-Frequent every day paiment with bitcoin, how much bitcoiner send more than.. what 1 Tx a week? You can bearly  found a place that accepted bitcoin anywhere (at least in EU) -
Even if LN was ready now it would do close to nothing the reduce bitcoin block.
One step at a time bitcoin need to grow first!

The issue we've got is people that want to stick with satoshi (so bigger block) have to fork the network,
And ironically the person that want to change bitcoin (settlement system for higher level network) just need to do nothing to get there. (censoring.blocking..)
I've bought in the satoshi idea and read the book of satoshi before buying. I like it to keep that.
But if someone fork bitcoin into something different and the community follow it, I will accept it; that the only legitimate way. (because you have to prove the value of your idea.. and the community vote)
Not by blocking/censoring idea and doing.. nothing.. 
You are taking bitcoin hostage..
@_date: 2015-08-19 06:14:51
There no benefit to temporary deploy some hash power and retract.
Doing so will put bitcoin in danger.
If you have 25% you have serious money invested in bitcoin will want the fork event to be 100% safe whatever your side of the fork.
@_date: 2015-08-30 18:16:39

@_date: 2015-08-12 17:41:51
I would pay for instant micro-paiment a little fee (if it is smaller than a visa/mastercard fee it make sense, isn't it?)
So I just don't get why they want so much to stop any increase of the block size.
Because if your business plan depend only on how much fee is paid by Tx on bitcoin blockchain... well... that's a shity business.. how unpredictable that is?
@_date: 2015-08-12 08:43:42
I think motives/conflit of interest matter a lot! don't you think?
@_date: 2015-08-27 00:32:45
You can gamed the dynamic block size if you can *publish* most of the block...
You will have to create plenty of spam Tx and only if you fill you block with plenty of spam you can push the network to create bigger block.. And after a *while* you have increase the limit and bloated the blockchain.. You have been .. an ass really..
.. But nothing prevent miner from being an ass.. Why not publishing only empty block right? A much easier way to be an ass..
@_date: 2015-08-11 07:56:05
Likely few people in the community high disagree on future of bitcoin or got conflict of interested.. 
But as they got key position (reddit mod..) they take advantage of it..
Probably with good intention.. Because they genuinely think it for the good of bitcoin,

With high fee and LN bitcoin become only a paiment system.

No more no less
@_date: 2015-08-27 19:08:21


Please elaborate.


Indeed, the convenience to use a mining pool to get regular income is the number reason for mining centralisation, not the block size.


100% agree, and all that happened with 1MB block size.


Sorry not a native speaker and format was messy.
@_date: 2015-08-10 04:19:15

How  high fee is big enough?
How  high fee dangerous?
How high fee before you start block some unforseen inovative use of the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-08-06 15:12:37
Larger blocks are a **proven** way to scale, since Bitcoin inception block has gotten bigger and Bitcoin has scale many order of magnitude...
Lightning network is not yet ready to prime time, it is a great solution it will usefull to bitcoin even with bigger block.
(it actually need bigger block too as per the dev..)
In the short term if bitcoin stay with 1mb block the only proven way to scale is to use centralised database (offline transactions) coinable, circle, changetip...
In the long run I fail to see why people would bother running a 1mb full node for the benefice of centralised entities... 
@_date: 2015-08-12 08:03:21

@_date: 2015-08-12 17:36:29
This is different from a direct conflict of interest form your own employer,
somehow the regular bitcoin user would have an even worst conflict of intereset... really thats your argument..
It's seems you the 1mb crowd you happily delude yourself by refusing to accept the reality for some reason..
But don't get me wrong I thing LN is great, I don't think it will be suitable to replace 100% of bitcoin Tx. 
(hey you still have to lock some money out, how much, for how long? that not very user friendly...)
I think LN (when ready) will be great to help bitcoin to scale but it will not be enough.
But what I am very uncomfortable with is part of the community waiting a corporate solution to save the bitcoin scaling problem. And in doing so being willing to limit bitcoin capacity.
(a kind of ripple-bitcoin...)
What is the solution get delay.. or never come? That's a big leap of faith..
 
@_date: 2015-08-28 11:44:27
But my point was this attack is not relevant to the current situation of bitcoin.
If  GBT and P2POOL were 70% of the total hash rate (which would be great for bitcoin!) then it will be very tempting to push this attack.
But it seems small miner has long given up on running node even with 1MB block.
But now mining pool are 80-90% of the hash power, I fail to see why any pool would try this attack. 
(unless orphan rate are negligible why would risk losing your reward to get advantage over 10% or less hash power?)
@_date: 2015-08-14 21:40:39
Is that true? Same mod?

I agree,
Such a radical change in philosophy..
@_date: 2015-08-28 11:21:55
Ok I get what you say if you are full node mining you are impacted more by cost of running a full node than a bigger mining farm as the cost of running the full is constant and the bigger farm has more revenue.
But this will be true whatever is the cost of running the full node. Cheap or expensive if you get a competitive advantage of not running will stop running one.
Unless the bandwidth use of a node drop below the bandwidth use of send your hash.
@_date: 2015-08-12 07:57:19
So everybody that disagree with you is an idiot?
What make you so knowledgeable?
@_date: 2015-08-12 09:03:10
The issue is:
LN cannot work if Tx are cheap on the blockchain.
So it seems the choice to be between LN or on chain Tx as they mutually exclusive.
Unless LN node finance themselves buy sell your data (a bit like goolge an Facebook your sell habit are very valuable to get ad revenue)

The issue we've got here is you have to fork to keep bitcoin to satoshi first idea.
Not forking will bring bitcoin to a whole different project.
(Not better or worst but we can all agree it a different one)
If there was no block size limit I am sure there would discution about forking bitcoin to create 1mb block limit...

I would not even bother to try double-spend especially in chain that will not retain any economic value.
One big mining pool can laterally bring it to an halt, publishing empty block after empty block.
Or waiting sometime before publishing a longer chain effectively cancelling several blocks a once without notice anytime.
The possiblility of two chain coexisting without a 50/50% hash rate is highly unlikely.
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:44:06
100% agree,
I was talking in the case the fork happen and one fork got 75 and the other 25%..
@_date: 2015-08-27 11:45:20
In a case of a widely used and functional LN, I guess yes... But if it happen now that will come with some serious trouble...
The main thing.. Only one mining pool (21% hash) will decide the block size limit!
Scary to say the least..
@_date: 2015-08-07 21:51:42
This exactly the kind of thing I would to found about the gold standard (in regard to bitcoin)

@_date: 2015-08-17 16:12:33
Bitcoin is not a copy of current financial system. There lots of use of the blockchain and inovation to come.
Jacking up the fees might prevent some innovative use we have no idea of.
But ultimatly miner have the last say if they prefer publishing empty block instead of collecting dust you will have to raise your fees,
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:14:21
I would more comfortable with dynamic size too,
But also If block are getting too big in future they can soft forked to a smaller size.
For the node number.. even if 60% node run bitcoin core after the fork they will be very expose to 51% attack.
Making the fork inoperative.
(you will have to wait like 24-36 confirmations before you can trust a Tx maybe even more because there might incentive to attack the 25% hash chain)
The only thing to do is to give up this chain an go to the most secure one, any business will do that.
@_date: 2015-08-10 14:19:18

(LN will likely his set off unforeseen complications/issues)
@_date: 2015-08-09 13:18:12
the issue here is the most radical change will come from not forking... If bitcoin stick with 1mb block it will have to rely massively on third party off cahin transaction and on not yet to be ready side chain and lightning network.. All of this with high fees per tx.. It is a big change I think everybody agree with that..

Its just playing with name XT or big block seriously who care?
(Beside who want to shutoff discussion)
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:23:11
It work in a bit diferent way:
-if the fork happen-
The two forks will built block (get longer) at diferent speed (empty or not)
One who build block 75% slowlier.
The second one 25% slowlier.
The will both be slowed down, because Hash rate will be devided.
One will be 3x slower than the other and de facto higly less secure.
Until the difficulty get adjusted.
@_date: 2015-08-17 02:55:39
Indeed fungibility is already an issue with bitcoin..
@_date: 2015-08-11 16:39:28
They are in favour of an fork because they see the advantage of bigger blocks and growth.
For the two forks to coexist you would need to have 50/50% of hash rate in both side.
I agree in that case the fork would be very dangerous/messy.
A fork will not be performed without support of majority of Hash rate.
In that case one fork will die of very quickly.
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:57:17

It's true that if the fees cannot cover the cost of mining.. a small emission of coin might be needed the pay the miner..
But I think if bitcoin is big enough, the fees should enough. But that just a guess..
@_date: 2015-08-28 11:00:32
How come anyone use a fork with 20% hash rate?
This fork will be at high risk of 51% attack anytime.
And as this fork will compete with the main fork there will be strong incentive to attack it.
This fork will be inoperative unless change it's PoS algorythm.. And yet another fork and hash rate re-start from scratch make it even less secure.

@_date: 2015-08-29 22:22:34
What are you talking about?
Obviously 100% hash power coming from one miner mean centralisation!
But centralisation is achieved *much much* before, you just need one mining pool/farm to reach 51% then you got complete centralisation.
Because you will have to thrust one mining pool/farm to not misbehave while maintaining the blockchain..
My point is 90% of bitcoin hash rate come from say 10 mining pools any single of the mining pool can reach 51%+ in no time if people send their hash power to a single one.
The vast majority of ASIC owner has decided to use mining pool (non-full node mining pool) , this is a terrible situation, And bitcoin got there **with small blocks.**
We would be much safer if 30% of the hash power were sent to mining pool as if they concentrate they would only able to reach ...30% of the all hashing power... unfortunately the vast majority is..
(again talking about non-full node mining pool)
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:14:49
Fair definition I guess.
But with one fork left with 25% hash rate the economic consensus will follow.
(It would extremly risky to keep using a fork that can be 51% any time without much effort. That is to stay the old fork will have no economic value)

Be careful you get insulted very soon..
@_date: 2015-08-11 18:31:12
I agree with you,
and the block reward will decrease slowly enough for the system to find an equilibrum,
But it has been argued the fees are not enough to support the network, I don't why, but it seems to be a wide spread opinion.
@_date: 2015-08-21 09:16:48
That I say.. When block are full.. If there 1.2mb of Tx to process whatever the fees you are willing to pay there no room for everyone.
Basta, without LN (if ready one day) its catastrophic for btc..
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:51:22
Once the fork will happened (that is to say when one block bigger than 1mb will be publish) the most secure chain will be the one with the most hash rate,
@_date: 2015-08-10 13:41:38
Forget about the name, XT=big block, get it?
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:11:40
It depend on how the hash rate on both is splited.
You dont want to be on chain with 10% hash power, as it will be expose to 51% attack from the main, making it useless,
@_date: 2015-08-17 07:05:55
The only case case I would loose money with LN is if my paiment channel is open with someone.
I lost the paiment history; somehow the other guy know that I lost paiment history.
He settle the channel on the block chain without any paiment history.
And in that case he will get all his deposit refunded, is it correct?
Just trying to understand the mecanic of it,
@_date: 2015-08-11 16:34:41
It is important to make the change before the network get overloaded.
Sure you can wait the network to be overloaded and then fork in emergency, 
But it is not very.. wise
@_date: 2015-08-15 17:44:51
I agree with what you say but the result 25% will make the 1mb blockchain simply inoperative..
Stackeholder got stack in both chain only the coin in the most secure chain will retain value..
@_date: 2015-08-23 15:38:19

It is obviously the worst case possible case two chain coexisting.
The 1mb would have a serious handicap, Having at some point 25% of the hasing power (at the time of the hypothetic fork) 
it will die off pretty quickly.
(block 4 times longer to produce, retargeting 4x further away)
@_date: 2015-08-21 09:26:27
I would have said more profitable?

Again the argument If any block bigger than 1mb; bitcoin will explode!..
And yes LN will introduce a certain amount of centralisation,
And likely some other issue, for example it's likely than a lightning node will record your spending to sell your spending to advertiser, (ala Facebook, google)
@_date: 2015-08-17 02:34:56

You might be pushing undecided people to the big block way,

And a push to get as much data as possible,
@_date: 2015-08-15 17:35:05
If there is a 75/25% cut from the miner, the 25% hash rate fork will be at high risk to 51% attacked,

I keep read reading that small miner has to be protected from big block from big miner.
I think this argument is not valid, you know how much investement you have to make to be a "small miner".. You can afford few % for your bandwitdth?
And if smaller mining are using mining pool anyway they are not expose to this attack..
@_date: 2015-08-21 09:44:28

He was actually talking about mining pool when he say:


The word mining pool didn't exist yet and at mining was part of running a node.

Your right the backlog would keep building until retargetting which can be very far away..
That fork will simply not be working anymore..
Actualy I don't think there will any Tx on that fork anymore.. As they will at high risk to be reverted,
You will have to wait what 24/36 confirmations to trush a Tx on that fork.. And block will take at best 40min.. 
In this condition this fork will just die off,

In my job we are as proactive as we possibly could (aircraft maintenance), If we are not the consequence could be catastrophic. So in my mind difficult change should be done before any crisis situation.

@_date: 2015-08-20 10:29:57
Thanks for your reply.
I didn't write my question properly.
Part of the current debate is let the block get full, let the fees raise and then there will incentive for off chain solution.
So my question was does LN need high fee blockchain to be used?
Is it possible to have in the future low fee blockchain and LN as an option? or the low fees blockchain remove incentive to use it?
@_date: 2015-08-17 11:23:46

It is decentralised indeed and very elegant solution.
But it bring something new, LN node can be localized and so shutdown or regulated.
This will not be an issue for the network as I will fix itself but for the node operator different story, and in a case of a "all Tx go to LN node" they will be a very attractive target for goverment, history show that they never been shy to do so.
The current blockchain is different as all the node are "symetric" and we are all maintaining a database much different from the regulation point of view.

The old chain coin *might* become worthless, It's a risk, the miner not willing to take the risk will move the main chain.

Both solution got there problem:
Bigger block most costly to run a full node
1mb block = cheap to run node but massive change in bitcoin phylosophy relaying on unproven solution to scale up.. The blockchain will become a settlement batabase for centralised system... Who will run a full node at his own expense for coinbase, circle, etc..
@_date: 2015-08-15 17:26:01
At 75% hash rate the will have consensus.
The old fork left with 25% can be 51% attack by the new chain will little to no effort..
The old chain couldn't retain any economic value being expose to such a risk..
Unless the old chain fork itself to change the PoW to protect itself.
But all the processing power will be lost to the main chain, It would be 100% of the bitcoin hash rate againt a all new PoW that has to restart from scrath..
The security advantage will be lost to the main chain.
Merchant will make their choice, there little to no chance of two chain coexisting,

@_date: 2015-08-27 12:23:51
Yes serious bias toward small block on this BIP.
On a side note block size has nothing to do with centralise mining.
If the argument is small miner will be outcompete by big miner due to big block:
Small miner are *already* outcompete by big miner, which small are not sending their hashing power to a mining pool?
And if small miner are big enough to solo mine, for the investment in bandwidth is trivial compare to hashing power, electricity.
@_date: 2015-08-20 09:45:58
The miner to push that attack has to take the risk of his block getting orphaned to get a mining advantage?
Well risking 25BTC to just have better chance on the next block.. Unless the orphan risk is negligeable it's a stupid move.
I keep reading post where it's said "miner can attack" "miner can break that" 
Miner are not our enemy? Are they?
Otherwise why don't they publish empty block only? 
Get the coinbase, minimum orphan risk leave the dust!
Yet strangely enough they keep including Tx in there blocks? 
Well maybe the want bitcoin to succeed too?
Thats the beauty of bitcoin all incentives are aligned in the direction!
And well yeah bitcoin is not perfect..

Guys from block stream are pushing their products at the expense of bitcoin growth..
You say Bigger than 1mb Bitcoin is un untested system and you push for side chain and lightning network!!
They are not even developed! let alone tested!!?! **Are you serious?**
And again:
Side chain are not much more than alt coin.. Lightning network is great for some use and for some other use it not ideal (don't forget you have to lock some coin..)
**Let bitcoin grow** and it will find it's balance between block size, side chain , lightning network!! 
**Bitcoin need them all!!**
Let side chain and lightning network be introduce in bitcoin when they will be tested and trusted enough.. not rushing to patch a 1mb overloaded blockchain..

I agree with Hard forking should be avoided at any cost.
But we might have no choice but to fork as even lightning dev say they need bigger blocks.
You are pointing out the irony of the situation.
A fork is needed to keep Bitcoin as it is, it is **not** forking that will bring the most change to bitcoin making it a decentralised settlement network.
You know what? why not? I think a decentralised settlement network with public ledger would be extremely useful and it might be the future of bitcoin.
The "currency" use of bitcoin might move to an alt-coin.
The public ledger for a crypto-currency imply to much privacy issue anyway.
I just wished bitcoin stay as it was promised but it might be delusional and alt-coin might be better suited for that.

As a small miner you send your hash power to a mining pool..

Both fork will have the same difficulty target,
So with one fork with 75% hash rate (the big blocks) block will be found in 15min on average.
The second fork with 25% hash rate will find block in 40min on average. 
One fork will be outpaced.
The miner will move the faster chain increasing the unbalance and for the slower chain will be it will be increasingly difficult to impossible to find any block.
*Miner will not keep spending money maintaining a worthless chain*. 
Fork happen all the time (when two blocks or more are found in the same time) the network keep the longer chain. 
(the most hash rate) 
@_date: 2015-08-27 19:28:11
Mining centralisation is not new.
You say people are not full node mining because the network load is already to high and the blocks are already too big?
If you are a small miner why would you solo mine (full node mining)? 
You will obviously use a mining pool, you don't want to wait 4 months every block you find, a regular income is a lot more attractive.
You know the cost of ASIC? electricity cost? bandwidth cost are trivial in comparaison.

@_date: 2015-08-14 16:23:38
Why not an increase of the block size as per Gavin 8mb +50% every two year AND If a scaling solution (LN and other) end up being able to keep block on a low size THEN a soft fork to reduce the block as it will be realistic size at the time.
This way we are safe on both side.
LN or other can arrive when ready, but if they don't we have a back up plan. Compromise.
If block stay small thks to LN reducing size will not be controversial and it a soft fork.
(A big one but still a soft fork)
Safe in each case.
@_date: 2015-08-27 15:13:32

It is the way it should work I believe too.
On a side note if I cumulated all the banking I pay per year. I get between 200-400$ a. (not including the crapy exchange rate I get each time I use another currency)
I would much rather pay that to run a full node and go off bank...

This would be a very expensive and ineffective attack.
And the relation small miner=little bandwidth is unclear for me.
And the investment needed now to be even a small miner is massive.. you can pay few % for some bandwidth.. yes if you stay with 56k you will be outcompeted..
(a small miner would send his hash power to a mining pool anyway)
@_date: 2015-08-17 05:31:05
Agreed, but O(n2) system can also be seen as a feature as all node carry the load, the network is symetric and there is not target or point of failure.
The is an extraordinary quality,
For LN it is another story, even tought the LN is decentralised, LN node can be localised, and therefore shutdown or (maybe worst) a target for regulation.
No big trouble for the network as other node can take the load.. But for the node operator there will be a risk..
And we all know how far governement are willing to go..
@_date: 2015-08-10 16:32:13
I think nobody want a non consensus-fork,
Where the chain would have enough hash/rate to coexist.
The fork will happen only if there is consensus and only one chain will be maintain.
(the other one die off.. with 75% less hash rate the second chain will not last long..it will take forever to reach the new difficulty retargeting)
If we get in the situation you describe... holy f**ck I hope I would have sold my holding before!!

You are right.. it will require yet another fork.
And computing power would have to come from somewhere..

Will they follow a fork that has to rebuild all his computing power?

No what I am saying is 90% got to mining pool and then if they concentrate to one pool we get over 51% in no time.
If only 30% of all miner were selling their hash then they could only reach one pool of 30% if they concentrate we would be safer.


Are you sure you understand mining? one miner providing all hash rate is centralisation (duh...) as much as one miner (or mining pool) providing 51%+ is **the same** centralisation.
Because in both case you need to thrust **one** miner (or mining pool/farm) to maintain the blockchain.
*Bitcoin is then not thrustless anymore*
One miner (or mining pool) reach 52% or 82% doesn't matter in both complete centralisation is achieved.


Yes. With 3 mining pools cumulating 52% hash rate we are f***g close already..


Now you slowly getting my point, 
And I would like you not avoid it and *reply* to that question:
**-How much from 86% hash rate sample I have used as example are using decentralised mining pool?**
People don't use it already now! even with 1MB block!
You yourself have argued that the cost of node even if the cost is small it can eat a significant part of a mining benefit, miner go for the most efficient/reliable/convenient.
Unfortunately they don't bother with running a node even with small blocks.


Are you arguing that with the current mining pool situation there no centralisation issue yet?
With 3 mining pools (and 3 full node) sharing 52% of the hashing rate??
Can you see any worst centralisation than that???? we are at maximum lvl of decentralisation with small blocks, big blocks would not make any difference as -almost- nobody (no miner I mean) run a node..
(as you say.. not economical)


First miner secure the network. they are not arming the network, without them no bitcoin.
And economy of scale exist in *every* industries, and it apply to bitcoin mining, ASIC, electricity cost, bandwidth. 
They are a business it's naive to believe they are not looking for any economy/optimisation. Getting rid of running a node seems to be the "optimisation" that most have chosen unfortunately..
AFAIK only proof of stake is not affected to economy of scale....

That's right some alt coin adjust the block size dynamically (monero).
But it might be like have no block size limit I guess..
The block size limit was introduced to prevent spam, am I correct?
What if we found away to prevent spam, maybe the block limit is unnecessary?
With fees, and giving priority to "older coin", bigger transaction, it might be ineffective to spam bitcoin and maybe block size limit is not needed anymore?

@_date: 2015-08-29 11:03:02
I agree with you say, but where I think you are wrong is you take the asumption that every miner work for the good of bitcoin look at every chance they have increase decentralisation.
If true, then the only explanation for the current mining centralisation is indeed miner being uncompetitive by cost of running a node or the node network load. 
Unfortunatly as you say in narrow margin business even small cost can have a big impact.
Whatever the cost of running node you will always be more competitive by sharing this cost with the other pool members.
And it seems looking at Hash rate share that miner has given up on running node, 90-95% come from mining pool how much of that come frome decentralised mining pool (like p2pool)? 
And when I see that running a node come at literaly zero cost to me I think there is no chance that mining centralisation will be reduce by reducing block size.. But bigger block will not increase it either as mining pool already got 90-95% of the hash rate.. Cannot get any worst.. (And we got there with 1mb block)
But I am curious how much you want the block to be reduce to achieve the effect you say?
@_date: 2015-08-19 15:00:31
I alway support the bigger block size side,
But I would have been no drama either way..
But the last months or so I found the smaller block being very agressive, insulting you and keep saying they are the majority in the debate (and clearely they are not).. Then happen the termos case... And also the bitcoin core dev talking about sabotage the fork.. 
that it! It is not anymore about blocks it is about getting rid of those people in bitcoin period!!
I will run a xt node at any cost to stand my position and to give us any chance!
@_date: 2015-08-10 03:08:02
I agree with you,
The most uncertain choice would be to keep 1b blocks,
Bitcoin would have massively change in use and "shape" to scale for there..
Relying massively on third party off chain Tx, and hoping side chain and lightning network to ready on time.. 
I think it's a big big bet.
But I think even the bitcoin against big block agree that 1mb is not enough..
Remember if the network get more than 1mb of Tx to process, no matter how much fee you pay there will be not some place for everyone...
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:31:28

But everything will be taking to avoid maintaining two chains it be crazy,
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:12:39
Just a thing about the 25% hash rate fork; coin on this fork cannot retain any value IMO..
As this fork would be under constant threat of being 51% attacked.. No tx could be trusted anymore (you will have to wait a lot more than 6 confirmations.. On at best 40min blocks).. 
The blockchain can literaly stopped by one chinese mining pool publishing empty block after empty block, 
Really I can't see a case where both chain will coexist, 
Everyone will move to the main chain,

You are right, 
I keep reading everywhere in this debate that miner are like the enemy of bitcoin..
Miner can break this, collude, etc...
I don't think any solution exist to protect us from every behaviour of miner.. only protection is decentralisation..
But miner act in the interest of bitcoin, at least so far..
Otherwise why won't they only publish empty blocks, get the reward, leave the dust.. little orphan risk..
@_date: 2015-08-12 08:22:32
Thanks to explain for pros and cons about LN.
And yeah the conflict of interest should be acknowledged, It is not controversial as long as the debate can still go on.
@_date: 2015-08-30 22:01:27
It would be a step in block size debate, it's not meant to be a solution nor the end of the debate.
A little bit of action in all that talking.
One step taken together will send a very positive signal to every one (media, miner, merchant, holder) 
That the community is responsible and can still act together.
I think it's important.
It will give the community more data and might give a chance to lightning network up and running (as 2MB block are not likely before 2/3 years)
It maybe a chance to get consensus on that first step.


Well sorry I try my best,

Hi Mike,
I have just a question, in a case of an hard fork about the block size.
If I start a new node after the fork, how my node will recognise the proper block chain?
I get that the 1MB block chain side of the fork will reject the chain with block bigger than 1MB, 
But what about the side of the block with the bigger block blockchain? 
Both side of the fork will look equally valid?
Both side will have block smaller than the set limit...
Thks, 
@_date: 2016-02-25 08:19:34
Read early Satoshi post and make up your own opinion if Bitcoin was designed with a 1mb hard limit.

Code being open source doesn't necessarily mean decentralised...
And relay network work only if everyone use the same network... If everyone use another relay network than yours have not gain much,
And if everyone use the same network that created a single point of failure..
Thin blocks speed-up propagation on every node compatible re-enforcing the network decentralisation..
With the same upload bandwidth you can upload your block to many more node..
(No need of centralisated server to speed up propagation)

I would say it will be at it's maximun when one mining pool reach 51%
At 51% you are back to trusth an entity to not misbehave.. Which is equal no decentralisation.
We are dangerously close to that now, even with small block, which tend to show that the centralisation force are independent of the block size.

It can only be gamed if you can public most of the block (51% attack) for a long enough time. 
Very very expensive for what result?
Improving you effective hash rate, well yeah.. if you publish most of the block, the blockchain already under 51% attack..

Everybody fall into group thinking..
Even more in bitcoin now that people diferent subreddit following their opinion on the blocksize debate..
If only there would be different approach to forum that would help break group thinking and healthy discussion..
But that doesn't seem possible.


And little to no effect.. 
Average people hear about bitcoin when it make the news bad event.
It has happened so many times that it might start to have the opposite effect, I think.
"What bitcoin is dead but wasn't it supposed to be already dead long ago?? What is bitcoin, let's Google it.."


FUD is all over bitcoin, because the truth is nodody knows for sure anything, bitcoin is still an experiment, the first large cryptocurrency.
Nobody neither Greg Maxwell nor Gavin Andeerson have any idea how it will play out.
Obviously in this environment FUD is massive from every side.
That didn't prevent bitcoin from growing so far.
@_date: 2016-02-19 05:30:20


This reduce your bandwidth 50% if you only upload one block each time you get a block,
Each node as to upload more than one time a block it received otherwise there is no propagation? Am I wrong?
So if before if you downloaded one block and uploaded (2MB up and down) only now you can download one block and upload to 2 to 100 nodes the same block.
Bandwidth improvements of 2/3 to 100 for the same propagation effect.
@_date: 2016-02-04 21:25:45
If witness data was still be included in blocks it would not be possible to create block bigger than the block limit.
Thanks to the soft fork segwit witness data are not included in the blocks.

This to me an issue with LN,
Say A and B open LN payments channel.
Both A and B lock 800BTC in the channel.
Monday both balance: A=800BTC B=800BTC
tuesday A pay B 799BTC for an item.
Wednesday balance: A=1BTC B=1599BTC
The incentive get very strong for A to cheat and try to close the channel with Monday balance.
Risk 1BTC and potential reward 799BTC, potentially "double spending" the Tuesday transaction.
In some case the monitoring of the blockchain is mandatory otherwise your at **real** risk to loose your coin.
Running a node at home might not be enough, a third party might be needed for redundancy. Specially if your are a business.

Totally true the cost of missed opportunity cannot be evaluated.
The cost can very well be high, specially now as the network rely on block reward to be sustainable.
@_date: 2016-02-20 06:39:37




The propagation time would be extremely long?
All 5000 node would to wait the previous one has downloaded it.
That would mean propagation time would be: download + verification time x 5000.
Say it take 1s to download and verify a block then propagation would be more than an hour.




Why you talk about average?

@_date: 2016-02-29 08:06:42
There is no take over...
@_date: 2016-02-02 07:33:39
So no explanation why?
This sub has fought so hard to prevent any blocksize limit increase and push for a soft forked implementation that give an attacker the possibility to **publish on the network 4x the limit block size!!!**.
(Without the scaling benefit that would give a raised to 4MB as a block full of 15-15 multisig Tx can only made to attack the network... It is all the inconvenient of big block without the advantage *and everybody agree?*)
@_date: 2016-02-27 07:38:44
Not is validation is done after you propagate the block.
@_date: 2016-02-12 18:18:01
So are you saying that 2MB is unsafe for the network?
Because soft fork segwit allow 4MB equivalent block..
Soft fork segwit expose the network with bigger than classic.
@_date: 2016-02-07 07:32:12


 And to answer who is buying it.  Not many. This is mostly in house farms controlled by bitmain!  Or I should say shitstain!  
This support the idea the mining centralisation has nothing to do with the block size.
@_date: 2016-02-07 19:57:08
In that case the bank will be the money transmisting business.
@_date: 2016-02-11 13:30:49
Well this is true, Bitcoin is majoritarian by design.
@_date: 2016-02-01 22:40:30
So it possible or not to push 4MB equivalent block size on the network with segwit as proposed with an soft fork?
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:28:05
A fork has been proposed with a forever 50BTC block reward.. With little success,
@_date: 2016-02-25 21:47:09

This post alone summaries the blocksize debate since 8/9 months..
Two divided side thinking that the other one want to destroy bitcoin.
At least the large block size has made compromize!
Even pushing for smaller block than the core dev team.
*Classic 2MB block limit.*
*Segwit (soft forked) 4MB equivalent block limit.*
So now fight is not about blocksize anymore.
It's about one dev team staying with absolute control.
So much for decentralisation.
@_date: 2016-02-27 21:54:44
can you please reply to that comment.
@_date: 2016-02-07 07:25:53
Edited sorry 
@_date: 2016-02-02 07:30:02
Then either 4MB is safe and it is much better giving the network 4MB capacity.
Or it is dangerous as it has been argued here many time in this sub and it will be much better to give segwit a much simpler implementation with an hard fork with a block size increase to 2MB.
@_date: 2016-02-05 06:34:03
So are you saying larger block size is not harmful to network?
After all the fight against any block size limit increase proposal?
So why not hard fork Segwit (with witness data included in the block) and increase block limit to 4MB then at least this available space can be used for additional capacity and not only to attacker??
@_date: 2016-02-11 13:22:20


Is it?
@_date: 2015-07-20 12:01:25
I didn't know that, 
This is Key, if PoS still required trust then it has to be inferior.
It also very difficult to grasp..
And I don't think it had an faster Tx validation, 
Maybe it was meant as it required less processing power than PoW that processing power can be turn to validate Tx..
@_date: 2016-02-12 22:03:34


this happened many time in open source project.

No and you know it, 
The 1MB was a temporary fix to prevent DDoS attacks.
@_date: 2016-02-12 08:13:41
Because core **AND** classic will be coding for bitcoin.
It's open source, those 343 peoples can also submit to classic, nothing new.
(I note that seems ok with the 4MB limit for multisig-SPAM blocks with SFSW.. I have to say it's very hard to follow what small blockist are advocating for..)

Is the current mining Hashing power outcompete the hashing of all bitcoin user computer?
If yes all bitcoin user could turn on mining on their personal computer for a while to put out-of-business big mining pool.
It would be some king of last resort solution (beside an hard fork)
Current Hash rate 368,157,891.39Gh
Number of bitcoin user let's say about 2 millions.
184GH/s can a personal computer can to that on average?
Or a significant part,
 
Edit: sorry found on google the hash rate for a PC at about 60Mh/s.... way too low I guess..
@_date: 2016-02-17 07:21:10
Satoshi voluntary avoided bitcoin script form being turning complete.
@_date: 2016-02-07 20:05:58


The worst compromise you can get...
An miner can fill block with purposely large multisig transactions publish larger block than usual blocks on the network..
This remove the "safety" function of the block limit...
An attacker can publish 4MB equivalent block on the network when regular user can get about 1.7MB block equivalent capacity,
This give attacker more than 2 times more impacts!!?
And everybody is ok?
@_date: 2016-02-20 06:41:30


Yes and more peer the first node propagate the block the better it is.
@_date: 2016-02-09 04:36:23


Destroying coins is **redistribution** of value and destroyed fungibility also..
This would be the end of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:47:54


I agree with that..
It will be great achievement for Bitcoin when it be so sustainable on fee alone.
@_date: 2016-02-03 22:00:21
I have posted about the 4MB blocks potential attack in this subreddit,
I have been replied to educate myself on the subject.. Well fair enough..
But when I asked details on what I misunderstood I had no reply.. Interesting..
 I am quite surprised rbitcoin are happy for a block size limit increase.. But.. Only only if it's an attack..
Are people gone mad??
@_date: 2016-02-08 21:23:49
Yes but that doesn't prevent LN node from being at risk to be classified as money transmisting business.
@_date: 2016-02-27 18:21:37
the more the merrier! Right?
@_date: 2016-02-11 13:33:03
Well more tx/s is not scaling?
@_date: 2015-07-19 09:07:45
Ok so no chance to compete,
@_date: 2016-02-04 19:54:59


Any chance you can elaborate or send me a link..
Because I honestly think Bitcoin core dev team made very clear they are against any hard fork.


Soft forked CT Tx?
This is nuts..
 
@_date: 2016-02-03 21:55:03
Soft forked segwit is very strange to me,
As it give an opportunity to publish 4MB block size equivalent to the the network it give the opportunity to an attacker to be 4x more impactful.
Either 4MB is safe and we would better with an hard fork to 4MB (with witness data in blocks) as this space can be used to increase capacity ethier it's dangerous and we would be better with hard fork to 2MB (then no 4MB ataxk or not are possible).
But increasing the blocksize only for attacker doesn't make sense.
(Note with SFSG 4MB block can only be an attack as block has to be maxed out with multisig tx)
@_date: 2015-08-19 10:25:25
And what is the second rule?
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:51:22
How can you compete with that...
@_date: 2016-02-25 06:19:44
Next to last message from Satoshi included the code to remove the limit,
Read Satoshi the early post on Bitcointalk and it will be obvious that capacity limited block wasn't the original design of Bitcoin.
Don't rewrite history guys.
Keeping that limit completely change Bitcoin design and fundamentals.
@_date: 2016-02-27 11:42:04

@_date: 2016-02-07 06:53:54


And you never thought than suddenly blocking that block limit increase *(planned from the beginning the limit was implemented)* was a coup?
It sure look like it, it give full control of Bitcoin development  to the bitcoin core dev team.
Edit: clarity 
@_date: 2016-09-12 08:49:38


I really don't think so.. 
As long as mining is that centralized risk is very high 
@_date: 2016-02-27 11:59:27
Sure, they are free to use whatever they see best for them, but keep improving protocol is critical (the relay network can fail or stop whatever reason..)
Stop improving the network because a centralised system work better is a dangerous idea. 
(It make Bitcoin dependent of a centralised system therefore Bitcoin become centralised)
@_date: 2016-09-20 13:41:45


PoW is paid by inflation now, it was meant to be paid by usage (Tx) over when the block reward will disappear.
Now usage is limited and people dream of digital gold, let me laugh..
If usage stay crippled, there will be no other choice than increase inflation to pay for the PoW over the long term..
Inflation? that fit very well with digital gold..
Keep dreaming guys...
@_date: 2016-02-04 20:58:21
So why pushing for soft fork segwit?
Significantly more complex than a hard forked implementation + it open the possibility of a my miner to attack the network with 4MB equivalent block size? (if block maxed out with multisig tx)
Effectively give a block size limit increase to SPAMMER..
All the inconvenient of large block (attack weakness) without the advantage (capacity)..
Hard fork segwit will certainly reach consensus.
@_date: 2016-09-20 07:46:56

By two times I would not have been able to book my important flights without bitcoin. 


Certainly not a shity option when it's your last back-up.


Explained before, because credit card get so much fraud due to all the "protection" added they are unreliable, if you like me travel a lot.

You don't know the place and you have no time off.
When and why would you look for a local debit card?
And Then while working, you find a new contract and need to book the flights for it. 
I have been in this situation few time and my only solution was with Bitcoin (local phone number can't be registered with my bank 2FA procedure.. when it is not the card simply blocked for my "safety").
Bitcoin saved my ass few times already.

Everything else that bank wiring is expensive to get bitcoin.
Due to fraud, not a failure of bitcoin.

I agree.

Bitcoin has zero chance to be digital gold if it is not a payment network!
Block reward will disappear.. and PoW is not free!
Without significant total transactions fee per block. Bitcoin is doomed..
@_date: 2016-09-20 16:42:05








You are implying that transaction fee need to increase to pay for the PoW.
How that will magically happen without adoption?
Whatever it is few Tx with large fees or many Tx with small fee, **in both case you need a large amount of adoption to get there**
And there are many, many more peoples willing to pay low fee than large fee.. 
Good luck to collect enough $10 to $60 transactions to pay the PoW when other coin can give a better store of value (crypto that are actually fungible) for a least two order of magnitude less.

Indeed, growth will increase decentralisation. As more people will need to run node (business)
Restricting growth hoping that LN can take care on his own of scalability is a huge leap of faith.
Bitcoiner average usage is not at all in sync with the LN "sweet spot" which is frequent small payment. How many of us use bitcoin on a daily basis?
LN will likely not help scalability at all if running now.
(I am not saying that it wouldn't when bitcoin will gain wider adoption)

I personaly very uncomfortable with the distribution..
70-80% from pre-sale the one year PoW then PoS with 0 inflation.
One year distribution??
And PoS on concentrated coins.. That a **bad** idea..

Agreed 4mb is not even a minimum I would say; 8mb is already a compromise...
For LN I growing more and more skeptical on it, I definitely think it as no chance of being the promised "scaling miracle"..
Just think about the user experience and the consequences of using hubs for legal/privacy and trust...
@_date: 2015-09-05 17:35:00
I really agree with you,
It should be both,
If in a future Bitcoin scale in "all by LN Tx" manner, this will open the the door big regulatory issue.
And if bitcoin get any big one day..  government will not wait to push regulatory pressure on it.
With LN opening a channel can be seem as an agreement between party and you might be hold responsible for the transition going thought your channel. If you collect fees you might be seen as a money transmitting business (and at risk of fine if you are not properly register as such.. KYC...), and some other case... government can be creative..
LN is a brillant system but it we all tend to forget that the blockchain on his own got the best "regulatory resistance" property of all.
@_date: 2015-09-11 08:32:59
But millions is still cheap.
And always be easier to set up than mining attack. (No hardware involve)
So it has to be many times more expensive than a mining attack to be "impractical"
It only take money to attack, many people has no shortage of.
Mining attack require hardware and there is only so much produced every months; Making this attack a lot harder to set up whatever how much money you threw at it.
And again the smaller the block the easier/cheaper/efficient this attack is.
@_date: 2015-09-08 07:41:26

Lot's of personal attack again here...
I have no doubts you think you position is the best and only one for Bitcoin.
I care for the very same things ad you (decentralisation, censorship resistance, privacy) and yet I got the very opposite conclusion as you.
Either there is two opposite path way to get to the same goal and any compromise will screw it up... Then I guess the only way is to split currency..
Either one of us is wrong..
But really what scaling solution small blockist propose: usage of hubs and off chain Tx to scale and you really think you will improve decentralisation, censorship resistance and privacy by using hubs?
Give it a thought instead of getting stuck to "experts" comment and opinions..
Nobody is expert in Bitcoin don't forget **this has never been done before!**

I get too many conflicting info with ETH, that why I stayed away from it.
@_date: 2015-09-29 07:05:57
I fully agree with you.
But I think I will support that small change  not because it would be any dangerous for the network but because I think even the most extreme small blockist would agree,
The all community would take a step together in the same direction, the fork should be effortless.
That would give the small blockist a chance to test the deployment of LN and -as I believe- realize that it is not a good scaling system.
We will all have better data to take a more definitive decision.
-know how the network react
-see if LN can or not help scaling 
-see how bandwidth requirement  has increased 
-see how bandwidth performance has increased over the world 
-see how regulators/bank behave against (*friendly* the large scale use of LN might be possible/*aggressive* then we are better of relying on the blockchain as it is more regulation resistant -no hubs-)

You maybe right and that's what I am scared about.
Then bitcoin would have failed has any improvement that will be brought to Bitcoin to help it scale up without loading the blockchain will bring centralisation.
With some unavoidable side-effect. 
(mostly making the network weaker)
I think Bitcoin has to stay as regulation/censorship resistant as possible and only the blockchain is good for that kind of job; hubs are a weak point.
Specially if it become "disruptive" to bank/states.
PS: it is not that I am not willing to run a full node, it's that I am not able to. (no stable access to internet; cannot open port 8333; otherwise when I got internet it's usually good quality/speed)

They can definitly and as it is open source project it can lead to a fork,
But I think it's much more balanced for BTC and I think it is very unlikely,
(Still many years of inflation/distribution ahead)
But for ETH it's 70% the first year and likely 100% in three years... 
There no way ETH get some wide/mianstream adoption before the end of the distribution,
How tempting it will to fork it instead of investing in those very expensive and concentrate coins..
If I was a ETH owner it would be a concern,
ETH is indeed ostile to late comer.

Take that example:
You open a payment channel:
Monday **A**=1BTC **B**=1BTC
Tuesday **A**=1.5BTC **B**=0.5BTC (**B** pay **A** 0.5BTC)
Friday **A**=0BTC **B**=2BTC (**A** pay **B** 1.5BTC)
If **A** settle the payment channel with the Tuesday version; **A** would have stolen 1.5BTC to **B**. 
In other word on 2BTC owned by **B** 1.5BTC are not secure.
Monitoring of the blockchain is required to prevent that.

Blockstream a non-profit??
Are you serious?
@_date: 2015-09-20 18:03:50
It has nothing to do with it.
Let's say I open a payment channel open for a weeks:
Monday- 1 BTC on the payment channel by each party.
Tuesday- I buy something 0.5 BTC. Party A= 0.5 BTC/Party B= 1.5 BTC.
Wednesday- the thing I've bought is defective I get refunded. Party A=1 BTC/Party B=1BTC.
From Thursday I have no internet access for three days (professional trip for example).
During those three days if party B settle the payment channel with the Tuesday version instead of the last version I would have 0.5 BTC stolen there no thing I can do about it.
This is not trustless.

Hey interresting! I would be courious to know exactly it. Would take!
@_date: 2015-09-20 12:11:57
Gavin did mention datacentrer to process block if the network had to process million of Tx per sec.
5 order of magnitude more than what BIP101 would allow.
He did say also that having datacenter to run node was not a good option.
And what you have to say about using hubs the scale bitcoin? (LN)
Which are by their very nature are centralisation?
That is actualy how they get their effeciency by centralising data.... And well we will all have to deal with the unexpected consequences of that.....
@_date: 2015-09-08 14:27:04
Why complicated?
Creating too big block come with cost and risk.
Pushing the miner select the "best" set of Tx.
We don't see it because reward is too high still for fees to create significant income.
@_date: 2015-09-11 08:18:03
It will 8x more expensive to do with 8MB.
So 8x improvement.
@_date: 2015-09-24 02:52:09
It might be dying because very few people accept tip beyond the bitcoin the bitcoin community,
I kinda stop using it because I tip the content I liked on youtube but allmost none of my tip where accepted.. Even after taking the time to explain...
Somehow it look fishy to people that don't know BTC :(
@_date: 2015-09-15 20:13:48
Hey just quoting here no saying that he was right :)
And I think it's great if we can keep bitcoin more decentralised than he tought possible..
@_date: 2015-09-07 09:31:37
The main reason why the bitcoin core disagree with BIP101 is because they are afraid that big blocks de-incentive the use of LN.
The bitcoin core vision is all Tx off-chain.
And that has profond implication on Bitcoin dynamic.
@_date: 2015-09-28 14:04:56
I don't know if it s still true, 
But I have read that you cannot audit the total number of coins..
That is quite an issue I would say, that would make monero far superior as can be done on it.
@_date: 2015-09-21 09:52:09
Not really as I cannot know how long I will left the blockchain unmonitored I will need to settle the channel each time I have no access to internet. 
(duration of my professional trips are most of the time not predictable)
In a 1MB blockchain with "all Tx by LN" It will likely make bitcoin too expensive for me to use.
It seems to be only suitable for sedentary people and permanent access to internet.
@_date: 2015-09-02 08:09:40
Conspiracy theory or not,
One Dev team see Bitcoin scaling by restricted blockchain and nearly all transaction handle by LN
the other want an increase in block size that also include LN
This create very different opinion in almost every step/developement choice for bitcoin.
It seems more and more than no agreement can be met..

I actualy think too that bitcoin might have to split in two currencies.

@_date: 2015-09-19 19:44:05
I agree with what you said a protocol that need the usage of hubs should be avoided. (Centralisation)
We need to increase the blockchain capacity as it the most decentralised and regulation-resistant tools we've got.

But some crypto can be nicely complementary to Bitcoin.
For example you can mix your coin by buying monero and then buy bitcoin back.
@_date: 2015-09-16 11:22:33
How can LN provide any scalabilty to Bitcoin now?
Average bitcoin Tx per user is what one a week/month?
For LN to help scale bitcoin now you would need everyone to move all thier bitcoin in a payment channel and lock them for long time to avoid bloating the blockchain. 
(At least for twice the actual average time between Tx; as you need two tx to open and close channel)
Basicaly put all your owning in a hot wallet..
Not everyone will be confortable with that..
(I am not)

There is only so much a man can foresee.
But he discuss about mining pool end 2010 and he did foresee mining centralisation and ASIC, he didn't call it that way, because they were not a thing yet.
He did discuss way back about almost all the thing we worry about and well didn't make a big deal about it.
But don't get me wrong it's great that can keep more decentralisation than he foresee!
@_date: 2015-09-12 11:26:30
We are few years away for being safe from that kind of pump and dump.

As it would no take special skill and bank know very well about how to kill or to manipulate markets already...
And mostly it would impact thrust in any crypto..

The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of **100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices**
**If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal**”
Excerpt From: Champagne, Phil. “The Book of Satoshi.” E53 PUBLISHING LLC, 2014-07-01. iBooks. 
Satoshi did **explicitly** compare bitcoin to visa level Tx and made no drama about it.
@_date: 2015-09-25 19:41:38
Agree but is it not a bit early for market to have already "adjusted" the BTC price in regard to the halving?
That would mean everybody is buying twice as much as would without the halving in mind it is possible but for a long periode like 10 months it is not possible everyone or at least for me,
@_date: 2015-09-12 20:01:07
Increasing the load on full node will likely increase centralisation if no other parameter change on the network. (Drop of the weakest full nodes)
Increasing growth will increase the load on the network, but also increase the demand for full node. 
(business for exemple)
If growth bring us to full 8MB block bitcoin will much bigger and thanks to that **much much stronger** and decentralised.
(Not to forget bitcoin will be in that case a lot more valuable)
Ps: Gavin's quote is talking about million of Tx a second which is 5 order or magnitude bigger that now... Nothing compare to increasing the limit 8x with BIP101.
(~100Tx/s compare to ~1 000 000Tx/s)
@_date: 2015-09-30 18:39:44
Where did I say the opposite?
Bitcoin payment can be made in several way:
-On chain
-Off chain (like coinbase/changetip..)
-payment channel (like LN hubs..)
My opinion is all payment option must stay accessible, I don't want a future where the only affordable way to pay with bitcoin would be LN.. This will likely come with serious consequences on Bitcoin..
(on privacy; regulation resistance; and maybe some other unforeseen issue due to the return of the "third party"..)
@_date: 2015-09-20 14:30:00

The issue is people like me that travel a lot, 
What about happen if I have no internet access for fews days? 
My counter-party can try to settlement the payment channel with a version of it that would be on his advantage.. 
Effectively stealing me some coins
As I cannot always monitor the blockchain in my case I would need some kind of online service to do it for me..
@_date: 2015-09-24 11:35:54

Agreed but decentralisation is a spectrum..
The decentralisation might move up and down and dosen't to have reach zero to already be a concern.

@_date: 2015-09-08 16:15:34
Most miner mine "header first", publishing a long to validate block to increase your effective hash rate would have little to no effect and you take risk to get your block orphaned.

Is running a node without seeding still helpfull to the network?
I wish port 8333 would open by default on every router then I would able to run a node on evryplace I got good internet.
The difference I see with LN node and I think make them weaker is that *data* is centralised. 
That's where they get their efficiency from but that will have consequences for the node operator.
You are making specific transaction possible you are not neutral and collecting a fee on top of that.
If bitcoin get any disruptive one day, it will fairly easy for any given government to fine node operator due to fail to complain with KYC requirement. Seriously damaging BTC if it rely 100% on it.
Different story for a Bitcoin blockchain node.
@_date: 2015-09-12 07:21:13

He talked about several mining farms connected to one node on the network,
Pretty close to the current mining pool architecture.
@_date: 2015-09-09 06:35:09
Ok I get your point of view,
I would not be that pessimistic, even if Bitcoin fail cryptocurrencies keep a tremendous advantage compare to the current financial system.. It's likely that another project take (at least partialy) the bitcoin network and growth from there.
It would certainly messy and lot of us would loose a shit load of money... Fore sure..
@_date: 2015-09-07 16:03:39
I am really concern about LN or equivalent.
Even if LN is a brillant system that hold the potential to massively ease the bitcoin scalability it might be less regulation resistant than on chain Tx..which is a very important feature of bitcoin..
If bitcoin get any big and all his Tx go trought LN; I think there a high chance the governent see LN node as money transmitting business or other regulatory trick to attack bitcoin..
On the other end running a node it's just maintaining a ledger (for free) much harder to attack regulatory-wise...
@_date: 2015-09-02 10:21:11


Satoshi foresee mining hardware, mining pool/farm.
He didn't call them that exact name because there where not a "thing" yet.
But it's pretty clear after a read of "the book of satoshi". 


Yes.. I am not quite sure what that has to do with "supposedly" Aug15 satoshi message.
@_date: 2015-09-08 07:58:54
I will take the unrestrickted blockchain, more Tx=more fees.
Growth is good!
When the block reward will disappear (or even just reduce) i can tell you miner will get picky with fees! Good chance to get you Tx without fee validated in the blockchain,
@_date: 2015-09-10 18:33:21
On a side note over the last year bitcoin price has dropped massively and difficulty has kept raising..
Surprisingly it seems that there no corelation between the bitcoin network hashing power and the bitcoin price...

@_date: 2015-09-30 18:20:14
But you are making a very good point here LN has to stay an option; then I am all for it.
As long as the blockchain not inaccessible due to artificial capacity limitation.
Then I will still be able to use Bitcoin.

It will be a commun good politicaly too risky to attack.
We need growth!
@_date: 2015-09-15 15:36:21
You mean a different PoW?
I guess he couldnot have gotten evrything right..
Just a thing I am wondering.. Let say the mining was and has alway been done on CPU... with the difficulty raising.. Would not be pointless to mine at some point?
As it would be almost impossible to ever find a block whatever how powerfull is your PC?
Would it not be some kind of crisis?
Maybe the ASIC and centralisation are unavoidable step?
@_date: 2015-09-15 20:21:40

Are you sure it's not an hard fork?
Because the blockchain will fork if a block with a tx without fee get mined and both chains will not be compatible,
Am I wrong?
@_date: 2015-09-14 08:35:07
This is the best solution,
But some argue that it can be manipulated (very costly for little effect) a bit strange when you see people pushing for BIP100 which include manipulation mecanism, vote.
@_date: 2015-09-30 18:13:55
More than likely I will not be able to.
I travel a lot for my work and cannot run a full node on a regular basis (no regular access to internet). So I will have to close my payment channel each time I travel.
And that's when I travel that I need bitcoin..
(getting foreign currency; back-up payment; etc...)
@_date: 2016-10-03 20:22:57


Without hashcash Satoshi would have use another PoW.
The concept of PoW exist since 1993
@_date: 2015-09-30 18:31:56
The issue is I cannot predict how long I stay without connection.
Therefore to secure my coins it's best to close the channel..
Making it unpractical for travel... 
Because coins I would have received can be reverted if my counterpart close the channel with a version from before he paid me.
It's only trustless once you have closed your channel.
But as long as LN is optional and on-chain are still accessible, I am good with; it just don't fit my usage of it.
@_date: 2015-09-30 17:56:09

@_date: 2015-09-30 22:11:13
The only way to protect yourself against bullshit and propaganda is to keep a skeptical mindset.
Question everything.
And I see little skeptical mindset in the core dev team about LN.
I don't get why they are smart people how come they don't see that LN is not a scaling solution to bitcoin in his current form?
If LN was deploy now it provide no help to scale bitcoin! why?
Because it is good a take lots of frequent transactions and compact it to two: One to one the channel one to close the channel, great, but who use bitcoin on a daily basis today? 
The overwhelming majority of bitcoiner hold their coin and send only very few transactions let's say per months..
LN would great to reduce the load on the blockchain if bitcoin has already reach some kind of wide/mainstream adoption where people use bitcoin on a daily basis... don't get me wrong I am very impatient for bitcoin to get to that stage but that fews years away a least..
Bitcoin has to scale first..
LN will create lot of friction if used as a main scaling tool for Bitcoin:
-need to lock you coin away for long time (time to build up enough transaction to compensate the two multi-sig for opening and closing the channel)
-need to lock most of your coin (to prevent opening and closing channel to often)
-need to monitor the blockchain.
My question is if LN was deploy today would you put lock all your coins in a channel? (more or less in a hot wallet)
I wouldn't you get much more flexibility keep them in cold storage until they are needed.
Only when bitcoin will have scaled it would make sense to use LN more and more... but not the other way around..
@_date: 2015-09-16 11:26:01
And same for LN node competition will keep them barely profitable.
Likely some node will use your personal info/ buying habit to increase profitability.

@_date: 2016-10-25 19:20:09


I guess one would be routing requiring large amount of bandwidth or processing.
(You node having to process many routing request but being selected as a route only few time)
@_date: 2015-09-13 09:02:58
It is a concern for the note operator not for the network.
You might be a risk to be fine for not complying with KYC rules as a node operator.
On a trust side is a bit different you need to monitor the blockchain for a on-chain payment only for 5/6 confirmation and mostly if you are getting the BTC. 
With LN you will have to monitor the blockchain for how long the channel is open or/and trust a software that will do it for you (attack vector).
And wait the 5/6 conf from the blockchain.
More trust is involve.
@_date: 2015-09-12 10:14:04


I understand being conservative is the way to go for a cryptocurrency dev team.
But it seems there is no conservative way to scale bitcoin.
Even keeping the block size limit to 1MB is not a conservative move as it require massive use of off-chain Tx or system like LN that will bring big change of Bitcoin dynamic and likely unforeseen issue.
Bitcoin is not in an safe equilibrium now either; as you say it can spam to death/attack rather cheaply.
Bitcoin need to get much bigger to stronger...
The path to scalability will likely involve some compromise.
Bitcoin will need everything to scale, bigger block is only one part of it.
@_date: 2015-09-26 19:23:39
Ok but that attack has to be very effective to risk your block reward on it.
It looks up-side-down to me, your are putting your block reward at risk for a chance to get better odd on your next block ??
It's like you are victim of your own attack!
@_date: 2015-09-20 17:11:32
I guess the term trustless is misleading.
It's more to-be-closely-monitored...
And you will have to *trust* the software/online service that do the monitoring job for you.  
@_date: 2015-09-20 14:27:43
It is not trustless as LN require permanent blockchain monitoring to prevent being cheated.
Centralised LN node very much an issue as they are not neutral you making specific Tx possible. The first issue that come to my mind is the very weak regulation resistance property of it. 
(You might be held responsible for Tx going trought your node, fined for failed to comply with KYC or other unforseen issue)
@_date: 2015-09-08 08:28:02
I agree with what you say, it's a shame you are downvoted because people dream of "one crypto to rule them all"
It would be nice, but not very likely for many reason.. 
And it would be better for all that fews crypto coexist in a large scale.. That would avoid some centralisation of power (like core client dev now..) and risk (some unability to adapt, unforeseen bug or unability to scale for a crypto, other would take the load).
@_date: 2015-09-12 10:41:45


As you say this kind of attack can be optimised to be more dangerous.. Millions are just pocket change for banks.. or western union which directly in competition with Bitcoin.
It is hard to know what is a "too expensive" cost to attack bitcoin.


This is partly because mining profitability is a bit shit and very insecure long term, because fees are stupidly cheap (related to the other point).
I would not bother with that.
Producing that much ASIC will take time.
Likely take months to get enough ASIC and massively increase the price of it.
Making this attack very obvious and long to set up.
It would be much more efficient to take that billion to buy BTC, no need to prepare the attack and the massive increase in price followed by a drop back to almost zero would kill anyone thrust in any crypto currency ever. 
A massive pump and dump... Nothing can protect us from that,
If the pump and dump is big enough it would send a serious message that "the old financial system will never let any chance for a new system to flourish". 
And nobody would invest any money in any crypto anymore.
As long as bitcoin doesn't get big enough to make the attack impractical. 
Bitcoin can "cheaply" be killed off: Pump and dump don't bother with hardware.
Bitcoin need to get bigger to be stronger.
Sorry to discuss only doomsday scenario but we are only tiny little in the financial world, and no technical/scifi attack is needed to get rid of us.
@_date: 2015-09-30 17:53:51

Because it prevent the whole crisis of transactions fee going to zero even if block size is not limited.
One of the main arguments to limit capacity is to force fee market to avoid that.

@_date: 2015-09-16 10:21:57
LN transaction are not as secure as a blockchain transactions.
With blockchain tx you have to monitor the blockchain for say 6 conf to be sure your tx is valid.
With LN your have monitor the blockchain for the **all** time your payment channel is open to avoid being cheated and the wait 6 conf on the blockchain to be sure your tx are valid.
More trust is involve and likely more way to be cheated are possible.

Is £3 000k cheap?
I would argue even £30m is cheap to attack a global system like bitcoin.
So are you saying that bitcoin is failed?
Because there no solution to this that as long as someone is willing to spend enough in fees it can spam to death the blockchain.
(As a side note the smaller the block the easier it gets)
Its hard to discuss with people that see only failure in Bitcoin future...
I am wondering if any of the main dev see any future in bitcoin.

No the blockchain require monitoring for 6 confirmations to be sure your transaction is recorded. LN will require monitoring for the all duration your payment channel is open to prevent your coin being *stolen*.
It is not trustless.
I understand you are free to leave LN payment channel if you are satisfied with but I fail to see how it relate to regulation risk in particular as a node operator.

Read the book of satoshi it's not expensive if you buy as a ebook.
It would give a good sense of how satoshi express himself and what he was discussing about future bitcoin issue (scalabilty problem was discuss very early)
And you that he foresee all the current issue, specialised hardware, centralisation, blockchain bloat...
And he was not half worry as we all are about it now..
And now he would have break his silence, as thing are being much better that he foresee?

I don't know why it is downvoted;
This is the critical point that for some reason small blockist fail to see.
And I would add by being bigger bitcoin get stronger.
It is now criticaly fragile to non-tech attack like a big pump and dump from bank/government.
And bank know all to well how to manipulate/kill a market, they would not bother with complicated hack or buying hardware to 51% the blockchain!

Sorry typo, just woke up.


On a static network, considering only routing not taking into liquidity and fee in the route calculation.
The number of successful routing will likely be massively lower on realistic condition.


Not aware of anyone dismissing it outright.
I have asked anyone claiming 1000TPS/1.000.000TPS none has been able to give any detailed calculation including routing.
It seem nobody yet understand where the LN bottleneck is.


So I ask you same question, can you describe the characteristic and propertiies of the routing under 1000TPS?
I give you mine:
Non-probabilistic, trustless, decentralised, assuming every payment need routing and routing status message 100Kb on average.
Every routing request has to be replied by every node.
So that your LN channel can find the best route trustlessly.
1.000TPS x 100Kb = 100Mb/s for each LN hub.
1.000.000TPS x 100kb = 100Gb/s for each hub.
now we can discuss.


Give me yours, then

I am not the one claiming Satoshi don't understand network and in the same time believing without a clue that LN no doubt scale to infinity..
Think about it for a second.
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:27:27


So when you claim 1.000 to 1.000.000 TPS it is with FLAIR routing?
@_date: 2016-10-25 15:29:41


Well I am talking about decentralised, trustless routing.




Then can you give the scaling characteristic of LN routing?
Is it probabilistic, has it been tested on dynamic topology?






They are payment channel, you have to add the cost of routing and then you will have a better idea the cost of LN usage.
Decentralised routing suffer immense scaling challenge.
@_date: 2016-10-26 04:38:39
Imagine your LN get to process all routing request and that take you all your bandwidth,
You want to reduce your bandwidth usage so you increase your fees then you get less routing request,
This how I see people increasing the fees.. then some multi-hop routing might end up being expensive.
@_date: 2016-10-22 09:05:34


Interesting never thought of that,
That suggest that without block and block there will be incentives to not collect all the fees therefore there will be a permanent back log!
@_date: 2015-09-13 07:43:41
And I have been explained that running a full will important when using LN as you need to monitor the blockchain to be sure your counterparty are not cheating you.
LN is more centralised than payment on the blockchain as payment go trought specific LN node and channels and not distributed over the bitcoin full node.
@_date: 2015-09-02 22:11:33
Aren't older transaction higer priority?
So they can sometime be selected before one with higher fee?
@_date: 2015-09-20 12:22:40
I can only talk for myself,
But for the first time I have bought Some other cryto for the only reason that it seems to me possible that bitcoin get stuck with 1MB... In that case I try to get prepared,
As I see more risk for the future of BTC if it stay with 1MB.
@_date: 2015-09-13 08:23:15
Yes but as the payment info is not distributed over the network and follow specific node, making those node at risk of regulation.
It doesn't seem to 100% trustless as you need to monitor the blockchain to prevent being cheated.
LN is indeed massively more efficient that the blockchain but on the decentralised and trusted point it's a set back.
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:09:03
Ok then explain me why I am wrong.
Tryin to explain here:
Imagine there is only three hubs in the network (low number to help understanding) you need to find a routing, what do you do?
You have to ask all three hubs: 
* list of hub/nodes they are connected too, 
* liquidity and fee.
Then your computer can calculate how to find a route, do you agree?
Each one of the three has to process your routing request, 1 routing request has to be processed by every hub, do you agree?
*I am still waiting your calculation on routing requirements for 1000TPS 1.000.000TPS, or are you one of those that had no idea routing might be a bottleneck?*
@_date: 2016-10-25 13:30:54


You are saying that you don't mind pay expensive fees because LN fees would be low.
What make you think LN fees will be low?

@_date: 2016-10-22 10:40:37
Does it?
How is that new, zero conf are unsecure, even the core dev are implementing RBF? Is RBF harming the network?
@_date: 2016-10-28 15:59:16


Segwit will authorizes blocksize equivalent to 4x the block limit, this increase the bandwidth requirement for the network.
**Independently** of the UTXO, The UTXO bloat can be be fixed with a hard fork version of Segwit without the 4x block size weakness.
@_date: 2016-10-26 04:35:28


On chain transaction are probabilistic because if you not paying enough fee you don't get in a block, *easy fix you bump up the fee and it is fixed* and probabilistic *by design* when only some chance to find a successful routing **and no plan B**.
That can seriously impact the usefulness of LN..


I have been involved in BTC for longer than you.


I am skeptical by nature and the claim made by the community about LN seem completely disconnected from the reality.
@_date: 2015-09-05 10:28:31
Yes it is likely a result from a lab experiment, thats far far away for commercial application/ mass production
@_date: 2016-10-22 19:36:34


This might even make matter worst, if 10% of your mempool get the most value any miner taking those 10% even if within the block limit will have his block at risk to attack..
@_date: 2016-10-25 15:06:45


This is unclear, routing is not even clearly defined.
What you are describing is payment channel, yes each micro payment inside the payment channel has little to no cost.
@_date: 2016-10-22 10:28:48


Well if they empty the mempool they are more or less Guaranteed to get their block attacked.
If you find a block you have strong incentive to unsure someone will mine on top of it.


Man, I don't know and I think at this stage nobody does.
Only thing for certain is mining incentives will radically change for sure..
@_date: 2015-09-29 07:49:13
All those problems means there are many business opportunity!
@_date: 2016-10-22 16:41:31


In this example with or without block size the problem is the same, you want people to mine on top of your block,
Without block limit the miner has the option to empty the mempool but it will not do that because by doing so it put his block reward at risk..
@_date: 2016-10-28 05:56:29
Payments are available, educate yourself:
If payment channel were able to provide any scaling potential to BTC why aren't we ALL using it?
It's by adding **trustless and decentralised routing** to payments channel that LN was supposed to unlock Bitcoin scaling.
Unfortunately very high TPS imply very high ressources to process all routing request in a decentralised manner.

This case is not interesting, LN will not provide any scaling if it cannot handle a very large amount of routing request. 
DO you agree, or you stick with 1.000TPS without routing?


Yes I know, and I try to explain you that adding routing to that is an **enormous** challenge.


Interesting you seem to admit that 1.000 - 1.000.000 routing request per second seem not impossible, you are making some progress to understand the problem..

You cannot remove the cost of sending big block that would mean you would have zero bandwidth required to propagate blocks!?
Gavin are working on bandwidth optimization to propagate block. A smaller block will always be faster to propagate and faster to validate than a big one. 
Bigger block will always be more costly for a miner.

@_date: 2015-11-07 15:30:14

it is true for now.
That block limit can push the market away from bitcoin.
Thinking about it, bitcoin being close to no have no more capacity, People might start to get incentive to SPAM bitcoin and take advantage of some alt-coin increase in valuation as a consequence.
For example buying 50000$ of Litecoin and spending 50000$ to SPAM bitcoin and betting of a Litecoin increase in valuation,

Yeah I understand that, you guys hope to restrain the Tx as much as it possibly be possible. I think it's unhealthy for the network.


Say from the people that fight to keep development as centralised as possible.... Ironic.
@_date: 2015-11-02 19:15:58


Same as bitcoin core.
Only the maintainer can make change in the code. He ultimately take the decision on what is going in or not.
Nothing controversial about that, any open source project work the same way.


Whatever it is one person or only one team (as it is consensus within the team) it is still centralisation.
Bitcoin core dev are the only one to decide for the future of bitcoin, it is the current situation.
It would be the same if bitcoinXT was the only implementation then bitcoin would be a centralised projet were Mike only decide for the future of bitcoin. 
It would be a bad situation too.
Have both (or more) decentralised bitcoin development.
@_date: 2015-11-05 03:58:19

@_date: 2015-11-04 14:48:11

Having several implementations should prevent that to happen in the future.
@_date: 2015-11-17 16:17:10

The problem is not empty block,
The problem is it get more profitable to fork the last block to collect more fees, this could make the blockchain less reliable.
If last block collect an abnormally high amount a fees the miner will keep fighting each other to fork it,
@_date: 2016-10-26 05:04:49

@_date: 2015-11-05 11:15:59
They loose their reward if the block get orphaned.
Publishing a gigabit block when other miner publish around 1MB put your reward at risk.
Even if you are willing to risk loosing the reward and attack the network that way verification plus propagation time play against you.
But I guess if you are lucky, willing to give it many attempts and noboby come up with a block during that time it might end up working.
The attacker has to be willing to support the cost to make that attack work. 
If you want to damage Bitcoin the current 1MB is a much better target.. Spend that money to SPAM attack the network directly,
(Much easier no hardware needed..)
A freeze the all network up....
Edit: clarification, and wrong calculations removed.

Mining is here to guarantee the irreversibility of the blockchain.
We are currently paying about 1 million $ a day for that.
With all thing being equal after 3 halving we will be paying:
3,50 x 144= 504 BTC/day (ref block:384126) 
$167 400, 6 times less than today.
The blockchain will still work well the difficulty will adjust, unprofitable miner will be put out of business.
But on thing will have changed the blockchain will be much cheaper to reverse, possibly hurting the value of bitcoin.
And many many outdated ASIC will be unused around the world an attacker will be able collect for a very cheap price all this hashing power and be able control of the blockchain for an extended period of time. *you don't want mining revenu to decrease by such a large amount!!*
At that point there will probably be no incentive to attack bitcoin anymore it's unlikely Bitcoin will have retain any value in such a "fragile" state.
Only an increase of the block reward can maintain the irreversibly of the blockchain in such a desperate situation.


*Your example assume unlimited demand, no cost to "maintain" the stadium, no competition (other activity people maybe more willing to the stadium get too expensive.. in our example another crypto)*
Well let's do the math:
$20 x $20 000 = $400 000 (say stadium 2/3 full)
The stadium is subsidized about 98,5% (Fee to block reward ratio: ref block 384126)
if $400 000 is what the stadium collect for ticket (fees) then the total revenu stadium ticket + subsidies (Block reward: 98,5% of the total ref block:384126) is: $400 000 + $26 266 666 = $26 666 666
So the total revenue of the stadium is $26 666 666.
Then the government decide to cut the subsidies from 98,5% to 12,5%. (result of fee ratio after three halving block, reward drop from 25BTC to 3,125BTC)
Then to maintain the same revenu the stadium has to increase to price of the ticket by:
$26 666 666 *(total stadium revenu)*- $3 333 333 *(12,5% fee to sub ratio)*= $23 333 333
$23 333 333/30 000 tickets=$778 
So in order to maintain the same revenu the stadium has to increase the ticket price from $20 to $778. *And this is by using all capacity available (the reference was a stadium 2/3 full)*
So now the question is: can you increase the stadium revenu when you have to increase the ticket price 39x just to break even?
Remember the stadium was 2/3 full on $20 ticket can it be sold out on $778 ticket? 
Do people will keep going to the stadium... or look at cheaper alternative?
And in the "bitcoin stadium" revenu is critical to keep the system secure/working/irreversible.

You say it yourself :


This is centralisation, LN operator might be at risk to be attack for not complying as money transmitting business. This is in my opinion the main regulatory risk... (Some regulation change has been made in the past to kill e-gold.. Unfortunately the regulatory toolset is already ready to attack LN operators)
LN being 100% zero knowledge would fixe that..


This make me think LN node operator might have the incentive to attack your privacy (collect personal data to make more money)
LN operator will collect incredibly little amount of money (unless the are enormous).. and your payment history is potentially very valuable.


I agree with that but I asked you to elaborate why you think fees are *sustainable* as it seems it takes revenus out of the mining fees.

With more capacity miner would collect more fees,
@_date: 2015-11-05 03:43:08


And that why we need bigger block, to give the miner a chance to collect enough fees when the block reward will vanish.
@_date: 2016-10-26 05:02:45


This is what I call no plan B.
Because it will seriously reduce the LN usefulness and scaling ability if it is necessary to open a new every 6-8 transactions (or even every 20 tx) each time you need to make a payment.




Believe me, it does. Big time.




Ability to scale to 1.000/1.000.000 TPS, complete dismiss of routing are the most commun.
Very rarely people go any deeper to check if such claim are realistic and so far LN is not way near (to say the least) from being able to come even close to the scaling ability claimed in the white paper.
@_date: 2015-11-17 08:24:00


why rush to get bitcoin sustainable? Hey?
@_date: 2016-10-25 17:51:58


Probabilistic mean the more decentralised the network will get less reliable for example..
And that mean that the prediction of billions of tx with only two settlement a year is irrealistic..


What do you mean by that?
@_date: 2015-11-12 16:00:39


the other miners success, of course I should publish. However, if my
goals are to find *more* blocks than the other miners for whatever
reason, maybe because transaction fees matter or I'm trying to get
nLockTime'd announce/commit fee sacrifices, it gets more complicated.
If your goal if to find more block?
Pointless if you don't publish it..
and this:


miners who have a given block gets further ahead, I need less hashing
power for my incentives to be to *not* publish the block I just found.
Again it doesn't give the incentive,
Find more block is pointless if your publish any, just try to outrun the blockchain without publish doesn't make sense?
What I missed?

Macroeconomics not relevant to Bitcoin?
Are you sure it's what you meant?
@_date: 2015-11-12 13:12:04
True, the day fees income will be big enough to pay for the miner then bitcoin will be truly sustainable!
@_date: 2015-11-13 08:19:27
Bitcoin has to be sustainable first!
If Bitcoin is forced to stay small (and it's no guarantee to stay decentralized) miner will see their fee income drop as mining reward get smaller.
It's highly subsidised now.
If bitcoin stay too small in the future the only way to keep secure will be to maintain the block reward... That mean paying for bitcoin security with inflation and not Tx fees (as we do now). 
That would mean getting rid of the 21million coins limit.
Bitcoin is like a plane it need a minimum speed to fly.
We are taking off but we are not safe until we fly.

It has to me. It give a change to get local currency without having to loose between 9-15% in exchange rate.
I am paid in Norwegian krona, work in Sweden and live in France. I can tell you I loose a lot exchanging currency fiat-to-fiat.
This is a killer feature for me.


I agree with what you say again if no other crypto where around and if Bitcoin was already sustainable.
Unfortunately bitcoin need to be 2 or 3 order of magnitude bigger to get to that point.
And we have limited time to get there (before the end of block reward)
I am not worry cryptocurrency are here to stay, the advantages over the current financial system are overwhelming. 
I just want the main crypto to be Bitcoin and for that bitcoin must as much as possible stay open to every user case every niche, restricting it now is a very risky move.
There is likely many innovation we cannot yet foresee..

I think this is the commun fear of small blockist that growth will destroy Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is incredibly centralised right now.
(Mining with 3 mining pool that can easily 51%, development with one implementation, internet forum and reddit playing the same music)

This was a dirty calculation to give a idea of what is possible.
Obviously the system is dynamic and making predictions on a complex system after changing a parameter by three order of magnitude is ridiculous.

I agree, growth (bigger blick) will bring more decentralion.
Small block need centralised service (off chain)or LN to grow and who will run a full node for an expensive to access blockchain intead of simply using the cheap off chain service?
Just out of altruism?
Small block will likely produce a massive drop in full node.

You loose something in addition to fee if your block get orphaned: the the cost of your PoW.
You still have incentive to choose a set of tx that will minimize the chance of your block being orphaned.
@_date: 2015-11-16 10:04:26
I cannot agree more this is a pressing issue.
I worry that the concensus decision process within the bitcoin core dev team is broken and will never be able to get any consensus/decision on a subject like privacy. 
(See the current block size limit situation, it doesn't seems like the core team will be up to the task..)
Any chance a software wallet can do the job without any change in the protocol?
I imagine a wallet looking for other output to mix when you do a payment, it would be a "mixin" within all the wallet user, that might be a good solution?

You are free to tell me where I am wrong.


Nothing about routing in the white paper.
Maybe you should read it.
From your article:




It seem routing is not solve yet.


One of biggest challenge of the routing is the dynamic nature of the network topology indeed.
The article confirm what I was saying..
@_date: 2015-11-05 13:49:24
It is indeed very counter intuitive ..
I will try to look into it,
(If by any you have a link for it..)
@_date: 2015-11-07 08:21:07


What make you think this limit it is too high or too low?
The block size limit has to be higher the block actual size to act as a DDoS and SPAM attack protection.
Again it's not because you increase the block limit to 8MB that you get you get 8MB instantly.
(LN and other off-chain solution will be available to reduce the block load)


Explain how bitcoin with 8MB (full block) will get centralised. 
I think you forgot about growth, at 8MB block Bitcoin ecosystem will be 4 or 6 time bigger, meaning many more merchants using it so many more node.
Bitcoin need growth to be sustainable, we cannot afford to wait the block reward to disappear for some widespread adoption.
@_date: 2015-11-13 08:25:57


Indeed mining is a race to efficiency which tend to push to centralization...
Unfortunately I don't think there is any easy fix for that.
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:52:44


If that mean 1MB limit block then no.
Then you should define what mean "reasonably able to run their own node"
But yeah you don't like giving precise answer, so don't bother.
You know discussion is possible even if you both party disagree.. But If avoid any difficult point... then it's impossible I agree.

Segwit introduce 4MB block attack, after segwit activate onchain scaling will **forever** be more difficult.

So what do you think of the recent proposal to make an hard fork safer?
Basically once the hard fork activate during the grace period all the block not supporting the hard fork are orphaned.
This is to give financial incentive to update quickly and prevent blockchain split.
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:50:47

If you reply to another comment on this one.. how can I follow..
Then I wish you reply on that comment..


And as the consensus could not be reach on any scaling proposal then no scaling solution has been implemented.
This crisis is due to development centralisation. And the reason why other implementation started.


BIP101 bring more capacity with on long term plan.
Selling second layer software that doesn't even exist as a scaling solution is the populist argument.
@_date: 2015-11-19 09:12:45


I am using the same biased arguments small blockist use against big block:
Changing only one parameter and look!! It will break down!
Bitcoin is beautifully dynamic many parameter influence each other and are self-regulated.
So I will give the same reply I have been given for my arguments:
*you should always take the worst case scenario into consideration.*
Bitcoin after three halving and no growth is dead. (or is not anymore bitcoin as we know it: no more 21m cap)


If Tx double for an extended amount of time, it's either a "panic sale" and everyone is exiting (and price will drop *a lot*) or an increase of adoption/usage/liquidity which will in turn will push Bitcoin valuation (main current usage of Bitcoin is now speculation)


Yes increasing capacity by 58x and filling it, just to break even.


Now you can see the enormous task ahead for bitcoin before becoming sustainable.
Whatever how we try: by restricting the blockchain, by opening up the capacity, nothing guarantee us to achieve that.
Bitcoin stay an experiment as long as it rely on his block reward.

You miss my point,
My point is there is no miracle, it a new system can scale Bitcoin to an infinity of Tx a second it will come with some trade-off..
So relying on a non-existing system and limit the block size hoping that everything will be fixed by it is a stupid move..
@_date: 2015-11-07 16:36:26
It is also a centralisation trade-off, Transaction are not distributed around the network they go through specific node.
That might bring side-effect: privacy(your payment history is one valuable personal data to sell), regulation weakness...

If in a static environment block size is the only parameter was changed then I agree, bigger block will lead to some node dropping of the network.
But the bitcoin ecosystem is dynamic, bigger blocks come from more transactions, more growth, more business. Increasing the demande for node.
For example (just arbitrary number to show my point):
No growth:
1MB = 5000 nodes then 8MB might mean 3000 nodes remain (I don' think block can get 8 time bigger without growth but let's say)
With growth:
1MB= 5000 nodes then 8MB might mean 6000, 7000, 8000 nodes (8 times bigger block would mean **a lot** more business is done with bitcoin some of them would need to run node..) 
@_date: 2015-11-12 16:39:44
But you would always have been better cashing out straight away each time you get a block in your attempt to get two block ahead,
His paper show that economically outrunning the blockchain can be done by even less hashing power that doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2015-11-06 08:15:34


Because the block reward will run out.
To make bitcoin sustainable on 1MB we would need to put the Tx fees so high that it will fundamentally change Bitcoin.
Because the bitcoin market cap is so low it can be kill by a bank/government (a big pump and dump) without showing of on their balance sheet.
Some bank spend more than the bitcoin market cap just for their IT department... (deutsch bank..)
It's critical that bitcoin grow before the block reward run out and before some government/bank start to be agressive.
The Core Dev Team are worry about (rightfully so) 51% attack, selfish mining or other "technical attack".
If a bank really want to kill bitcoin they will do what they know better manipulate the market.. 
They will not bother with any technical attack that need knowledge and hardware.. they got way enough cash to kill bitcoin..
Bitcoin need to grow **a lot** to make financial attack impractical.

@_date: 2015-11-06 18:13:34


So please what do you mean by that?
Coins has to be locked in the payment channel until you settle to the blockchain correct.
So for LN to be able scale bitcoin on 1MB you need:
All/most of your coin in a payment channel.
(To avoid to settle too often and bloat the blockchain)
Lock for long time. (To collect enough Tx)
The majority of Bitcoin user hoard and send very few Tx. 
The miner fees has to be extremely high to push them to use LN with unfrequent Transactions.
(But with wider/mainstream adoption LN will work great and make a lot of sense)
@_date: 2015-11-08 11:04:24

Can you provide a link? I am interested, which company provide than service?
@_date: 2015-11-08 09:46:51
It is centralisation because LN use hubs.
That how it gets its scaling capability because Tx info are not distributed anymore 
The fact that is trustless doesn't mean decentralisation.
This will come with some tradeoff, the main I see is regulatory weakness.
(LN hubs can be seen as money transmitting business)
Privacy might better than the blockchain that would be good, ideally LN should be zero knowledge then LN would be a killer.
Otherwise you will have to trust the hub to apply privacy and not collect personal data to make an extra bucks.
For the fees being sustainable with LN network can you elaborate?

Block size limit increase doesn't weaken the network...


And take away mining fees.. reducing miner income.. a major issue when the block reward will disappear.
Hash rate is not free.
Bitcoin will slow getting cheap to 51% attack, and mining farm might consolidate further pushing centralisation.
Bad bad scenario


This is wrong. otherwise block would have been be full years ago.


1MB make it much cheaper and effective to DDoS attack the network. capacity is already full It would not cost much to harm the network now.


Completely false as I said look at the block size over the last years.


It is very expensive to SPAM a 50MB block size limit blockchain for any significant time, making those attack less likely and will resolve faster.
Attack being more expensive and less effective mean that over time a bigger block limit blockchain will get less DDoS attack so less SPAM stored in the blockchain.


I guess you meant 50MB block size limits so assuming block half full, with 25MB, bitcoin would be massively bigger, miner fee income will be 25x more (that mean after the halving 50x important in proportion for miner income)
For example fee would be 5250$ per block!! (block:1MB get 0,6BTC x 25MB ref: 382927) 
This would be glorious, I would say bitcoin would be strong and sustainable at that stage!
And yes node would have dropped, other would have start (likely many more as bitcoin would so much bigger).. but don't believe the doomsday sayer *today* bandwidth in many places can deal with that already!
And some improvement being tested now give 14x improvement in upward bandwidth.. Bitcoin can scale much more than many thinks.

How can it scale Bitcoin in its current form?

Mempool size(mb):	16.33
Transactions per second:	2.18
16x the current block size limit.


Change tip use off-chain transaction between their customer and the blockchain. This is not maint to scale bitcoin.
(unless your are pushing for a centralised scaling solution?)
The current 2nd layer proposal are side-chain and LN hubs.
They are proposed as decentralised scaling solution for bitcoin with significant change on bitcoin fundamental. 
It will only way be sure that those change doesn't come with dangerous side-effect to bitcoin ecosystem and really test their ability to scale when they will be tested "live".
Before that it's just wishful thinking.

I am not quite sure we understand each over.
I am not trying to say witch one is better,
I am saying that I agree with Mike point that bitcoin is now a centralised project.
Only the Bitcoin Core team decide for the future of bitcoin whatever the community/miner/merchant/non-core dev think.
**Only** the maintainer can include any change to the code.
The fact that he decide to include change to Bitcoin Core only by consensus doesn't change that fact.
One dev team consensus is approved by one person.
Say for example no change reach any consensus in the team (It's an example I exaggerate to make my point clear) then no change will happen to the code **because** the development is centralised.
indecision/stagnation can also be an consequence of development centralisation in that case. 
BitcoinXT dev also use a maintainer to approve code or not (I don't think he claimed otherwise).
Having several implementation can prevent stagnation or capture of bitcoin future development.

@_date: 2015-11-10 10:18:28


What make you think that? link?


My commun sense tell me that LN can ruin network security.
For example nothing prevent a LN channel to settle 10000Tx (or many more) on the blockchain with two Tx costing say... 100€.
To give you an idea 10000Tx is 540€ of Transactions currently. (reference block:382875)
That would 440€ of fees are not anymore invest in bitcoin security.
To put it in another way the fee you pay with LN network in not anymore invested in the network security. this could be a major issue.
Specialy because the block reward will not last forever.


Again what make you think that? link?
This argument is repeated everywhere without any prove of it.
Remind you that bigger block will be because of growth.
Say in four years the blockchain regularely get blocks between 11 and 14MB. 
This will not come without a massive increase of the bitcoin economy and ecosystem.
The market cap will be likely 5 or 6x bigger, many many more business (and some of them will need to spin a node..)
With 11-14MB sized block in future we might very well end up with many many more nodes.
(improvement can be made on bandwidth usage "see thin block" 14x improvement in upward bandwidth in a ideal case but even further improvement are possible... **we can scale a lot more even without bandwidth improvement already now**)


Agreed it is one of them, all large blackouts argue that many different solution are needed, the market should decide and not a dev team.
But more importantly it is not the only one solution, as in that case it would end taking away mining revenue and in the long term that can kill bitcoin.
Here is a post from bitcoin forum that I think summarised well the position of "small blockist":


The is a fundamental mistake here I think is thinking bitcoin is strong now.
It is not, if bitcoin doesn't grow significantly in 10 ten year it is dead.
(either by the death of block reward or killed by bank/government as the market cap is so small)
Limiting bitcoin grow now that we still have the block reward to help us is a very risky move.

You eventually publish, once you are 2 ahead.
Impossible if you have 30% hash power as he is showing in is example.
You cannot outcompete 70% of hash power, so you will have to wait a long time to have any statistical chance to outrun the blockchain by two blocks... 
It will have cost you a lot of electricity and block reward lost when you were ahead of the chain by 1 block and you didn't publish and got overtaken..
@_date: 2015-11-13 16:59:27
it seems to me that you think the only way for bitcoin to stay decentralised is to stay small.
Decentralisation is a complex phenomenon, staying small might actually push centralisation in some case (by pushing to consolidate, business giving up on bitcoin..)
But growing will pushing decentralisation (more need to run nodes), making bitcoin core more useful (implementing HD wallet, making easy to use, etc..). Incentivise the node can help too, optimisation of the code to reduce the bandwidth can help too (see thin blocks).
There is many way decentralisation can go up and down. But saying bitcoin cannot scale without getting broken are lying..
(Bitcoin has to grow.. the block reward will not stay forever)

@_date: 2015-10-03 09:32:02
It is not a scaling solution.
It would be great to reduce the workload of Bitcoin blockchain if bitcoin had already scaled to some kind of wider or mainstream adoption. Then introducing LN would take a lot of work out of the blockchain, because lots of people will be doing frequent transactions.
But the current average usage of bitcoin (unfortunately) far from that.. It's still very hard to find place to spend Bitcoin (in Europe at least).
The average usage is hoarding and 1tx every month maybe? Then with bother locking your funds in a channel?

The system is dynamic and anti-fragile, it will get stronger and more decentralized by growing.
If Bitcoin stay small it will stay fragile and never be disruptive and another crypto will take the lead.
That's free market.. You can only go against for some time then if there is a demand for it the competition will take the lead..

Sure that's my point here, as almost nobody use bitcoin for daily spending so LN cannot provide much help now.
But in the (not so distant I hope) future, It would make a lot of sense. Bitcoin need to be more widely accept as payment everywhere.
Need some wider/mainstream adoption first.
(I can only talk for Europe, it difficult to found a place to spend your bitcoin still)

To increase the amount of money locked in your channel you have to settle it and re-open it.
If you get you income monthly.. You might settle your channel monthly.
And the money you lock in a channel is basically a hot wallet, many would prefer settle to put there money in a cold wallet,
All that will likely demand for more than two settlement a year..

How can running a node be incentived?
I am honestly wondering, I try to think about it and cannot quite see how it could be done.. 
As all node are "symmetric" so they would get the same reward..Could it be a cut form Tx fees?.. which divided by 6000+ nodes would make very small..
Maybe the more you get upload connections the more you get reward? to reward the node uploading the most?


Indeed I cannot check on my connection right now but I think upload speed should be lower,

- Network adds 1 member to reach 3 members. Each has to verify all others, 3 members has 2 others to validate equals total validation cost 6.
- Network reaches 10 members, each has to verify all others, 10 members times 9 others to validate equals total validation cost 90
No if one more Tx is send on the network there 1 more Tx to verify per node. It is a linear increase in resources.


If all user new user send Tx to all possible other user then yes.
But it is not a blockchain limitation, it would be exactly the same with a centralised system.
If every user of a payment system send a payment to every single other user you will have an exponential increase in cost because you have an exponential increase in **demand.** (this would also apply for LN)

True and as p2p message can't be bigger than 32MB,
Both BIP100 and BIP101 are limited to 32MB block without code change.
Ironically enough BIP101 is much more conservative than BIP100 (BIP100 can reach 32MB much faster than BIP101)
And for both of them consensus (again) will be needed to grow any bigger than that.

my current usage of bitcoin I am making one Tx per months maybe..
That mean I would have to lock my coins in a payment channel for... like 3-4 months maybe more to get any gain for LN..
(openning and closing a LN channel take more data than one regular Tx)
Why would I do that unless I am making much more Tx,
Fees have little to do to it..

Yes but that your own Tx, it doesn't qualified as a money transferring business.


Sorry no, your node make specific transactions possible that's how LN get its efficiency (by centralising Tx data though one specific node).
You might have to comply with KYC on the specific Tx you processed.
The blockchain is distributing Tx data on every single node on the network. By running a bitcoin full node you are only responsible for your own Tx. Whatever your node is running or not you are not making **other** people Transactions possible.


It would be nice if collecting fee where optional. In France at least, I believe if your are no making money out of it I believe it might be enough to not be seen as a money transmitting business.. but I not sure.

This is a number given with two settlement per year and NO other use of the blockchain.
The block size limit has to be at least 10x that IMO in order to serve 7billions. (In order to take into account every blockchain usage, peak demand..)
But your right this mainstream adoption scenario LN (and similar) would be essential.
But again this calculation is so far of in the future, as many many other parameters will have changed, that is almost certainly irrelevant.

@_date: 2015-11-16 15:18:25


It will be indeed dead, if bitcoin stay as small as now the fee income will not finance the mining industry enough, not even close.
One desperate move to maintain an heathy level of mining will be increase the block reward, with the consequence you can imagine.
No other solution the miner are paid by fee or block reward.. if fees income drop to low.. no other choice than increase inflation, network security is not free.


They are linked,
You can look at the past year stats the correlation is very high.. 
There will be Tx threshold were we will see a massive increase in Bitcoin valuation. When the people will no more see the need to return to FIAT (because bitcoin will be everywhere)
That will also be a great boost for the node as many business will less and less need to use for a payment processor like bitpay.


There will be because you will be reducing some business case.


Enough to pay 1 000 000$+ a day to maintain the mining industry?
When other crypto get available capacity? some got no hard cap?
Don't forget that even with a close to zero fee per transaction you are still paying for the network safety with the inflation. 
The block reward is here to give bitcoin some time to grow big enough for the fee to pay the network security..
Moving all the Tx and fee income to a 2nd layer might kill bitcoin..

What happen when more than 1MB per 10min of non-SPAM Tx hit the blockchain on a daily basis?
@_date: 2015-10-23 03:09:10


Large companies can already process large amount of Transactions off-chain by maintaining their own database and settle it with the blockchain once in a while.
This is already done now (coinbase; changetip)
Lightning network live on the promise that everyone (companies and average bitcoin user) has large amount ot transactions regularly.
In that case Lightning network will do a great job at taking some workload out of the blockchain by collecting transactions in the payment channel and settle it down in the blockchain once in a while too.
But note that even if implemented now lightning network will not help to scale or reduce the blockchain workload as companies that need to process a large amount of transactions use their own off-chain database and the average bitcoin user send very few transactions.
Far away from the LN sweet spot.
We are fews years away before LN will useful as a scaling system; bitcoin need to first gain some kind of mainstream or wider adoption..
Bigger blocks will be needed first.
(Bigger blocks will be needed for LN also)

yes and it doesn't matter to you, you only have to cover the cost of your own node. the fact that other node has to do the same doesn't come at any cost to you.

If you introduce a new system to improve an old one you introduce it extremly carefully and let it play a major role only when it will be mature enough.
The argument "capacity is no issue and LN when save the day" strike me as **extremely populist**.
Bitcoin similarity with aircraft system they are complex and has to reliable and secure.
In commercial aviation it took as much as 20-30 years before an aircraft manufacturer build enough knowledge and confidence to build an airframe out of composites.

There is no mathematical proof of hidden inflation that why I took that example.
The official calculation of inflation is what it is, you have to "trust" official to give good number.
But traveling is good way to get a feel for inflation, 
I spend two years away at my return the price of many things has risen well beyond the 1-2% official inflation rate.
Human at feeling slow change,
For ex: housing, renting, transportation..  Way above 2%... There actually above 15%
Miscalculating it conviently made my country pay less than it should to pensioners, and the french pension system is loosing a massive amount of money every year. 
Politics has never been able to reform it.
The coward way to fix I guess.
The issue will be in for in 30years my pension will be worth nothing I pay big price for it now... But few percent at the time nobody see it..
Some pensioners already now are below the poverty line.. If inflation were properly calculated thier buying power should have been sustained.
There are other benifice to hide a bigger rate of inflation (the amount of dettes of you state is worth if the money is worth less)
There is a conflict of interest in this calculation.
(Also housing bubble and stock bubble in the same time? If the money supply is fixed it cannot happen; one market would dry the other one money.. This all fit much more a high inflation rate scenario...)

@_date: 2015-11-17 18:38:15


look like an healthy network indeed.. /s
Interesting that you say on this subreddit that the mempool is 2MB.. you are not being very honest..


You complain about big block making bitcoin centralised and you advocate for centralised solution to scale bitcoin on 1MB...


This is a key point. 
Is it worth compromising bitcoin security and model for little gain in efficiency? (those efficiency gain always come with side-effects)
Is not better increasing the block size, accept that the running will take more resource but guarantee to censorship and regulation resistance of bitcoin?


It is not as simple allow bitcoin to grow will increase the demand for node.


Keeping the block size small and increase fee is taking the risk of slowing down adoption and might prevent us to reach the point when fees will be able to pay for the network security without the block reward.. a **critical** point for bitcoin.


The security model of the network can break down if all/most the fee income move to second layer solution.
Some interesting reading on block limit if you are open minded:
(don't forget LN dev say they 133MB block for mainstream worldwide use of LN with only 2 settlement a year)
@_date: 2016-05-22 08:53:26


- Network adds 1 member to reach 3 members. Each has to verify all others, 3 members has 2 others to validate equals total validation cost 6.
- Network reaches 10 members, each has to verify all others, 10 members times 9 others to validate equals total validation cost 90


Well the explaination you gave is not how the system work.

This is a very odd definition of spam, by your definition all bitcoin transactions but mine are spam. (I only consented to my own Tx and I have no say on others)
If consent is necessary (how? and by whom?) for some Tx to be processed is it not the beginning of some type of control/censorship?
Proof of existence is an example of one of the many other possible disruptive (non-monetary) usage of the blockchain.
Do you see all non-monetary use of the blockchain as spam?
Do you really see no benefit of the blockchain beyond transfer of value?

Very naive proposal for the sake of discussion:

If one of A, B, C is tainted then D, E will be.
It's the algorithm to decide how D, E will be tainted. It will be likely "less" tainted every time they get "diluted".

It's certainly working with some trade off for sure,

This true because neither LN and paypal are distributed network. The cost of verifiy Tx is *distributed* among every peer.
Instead of non-distributed system where the cost of verifying Tx is cover by *single point of failure*


There is no exponential broadcasting.
And distributed network are not stupid, this a key feature that make them resilient.

Why it matter?
As long as individual critical part of the system scale linearly.


Ok let's do a little thought experiment:
Every LN user send tx to all other LN user:
2 users, every LN node has to verify only 1 tx. Total cost system: 2
3 users, every LN node has to verify 2tx. Total cost sustem (2tx x 3 nodes:) 6
4 users, every LN node has to verify 3tx. Total cost system: (3tx x 4nodes). 12
5 users, every LN node has to verify 4tx. Total cost system: (4tx x 5nodes): 20
woow how crazy? It's exponential!
So what happen here? Is LN broken too?
Not matter if LN require less resource and don't need the full record history, if the cost increase exponentially it cannot scale.
Or maybe you missunderstood this:

@_date: 2015-10-01 09:07:24
No it doesn't.
With LN you are making specific transactions possible.
You can be held responsible for it.
With the blockchain your are maintaining a ledger.
Running a bitcoin node is not making your responsible for any Transactions beside your own. it is **very** different.
That's what make the blockchain very regulation/censorship-resistant. (simply the most regulation/censorship-resistant ever made period)
It is what most people see has horribly inefficient, every node has to record every transactions in the network.... But it is the **killer feature** of the blockchain. Node are neutral.
It took me long time to realise it, I was stuck with the idea there has to be a better way that's sound like a bad design for me.
But there is **not**; it is where bitcoin get its strength. 
Bitcoin will have no chance to be disruptive by using hubs...

Totally agree, this is why ot is important to understant that node resources grow linearly.


You took the asumption in your example that every user send tx to every user, forget about the network topology.
This asumption always lead to exponential growth
This apply to any kind of network, cryptocurrency or email...
A full node is just a full record of said transactions.
A record of transaction grow linearly.
*one more tx is equal to one more tx to record and not (x-1)^2 more tx to record*

now if I take it as a reference let multiply the fees 1000x:
Size about 976MB.
Fee collected would be: 414.84 BTC

There is no solution for bitcoin growth with only 2nd layer network too.
(unless you are ready to loose the 21 Million coin cap when fee income will be too low to maintain the main chain)
It is both!
The main chain cannot take the whole world economy Tx I agree, but it can reach the level needed to make bitcoin sustainable.
@_date: 2015-11-12 13:10:53


And in that case the only solution to maintain the mining industry will be to get rid of 21 million coins limit..
The hashing has to be paid for, if it will not by fee income it will be by inflation...
Bitcoin economy has to grow big enough for the fees to replace the block reward otherwise bitcoin will have failed. 
And we have limited time for that.. restricting the blockchain is an incredibly risky move..

Then you are buying a coin that can possibly be refused by another exchange. For the same price wouldn't you prefer a "clear" coin?
Ok it is not a major issue now but there is reason to think it will be.
Let's take an example, say we are in 2030 and bitcoin is the only currency used everywhere.
You are living in bad suburb and police knock at your door:
"We have a warrant please give us access to your bitcoin wallet"
Then the police will be able to run an analysis on your bitcoin.
If the result is 1% of your coins are tainted and 5% a little bit tainted and the rest is clear, then your are most likely a good citizen but if the result is 30% of your coins are tainted 50% a little bit tainted, then you are "statistically" more suspicious....
That's a privacy issue you will tell me, well that's right it is! But not only. 
You have also access the blockchain, in such a future people will avoid tainted coins as much as possible therefore making them less valuable.. Fungibility will then be broken.. 1BTC ≠ 1BTC... Unfortunately BTC in its current form is very "surveillance state" friendly.......

Each mining pool are collecting all the individual miner hashing work to produce blocks. 
If every individual miner where running there own full node then it would decentralised. 
This 3 mining pool are basically 3 nodes.
(note than some mining pool let miner run their own node)


Ok you forgot one..


Check how many node are running each implementations are running and you will have your answer.




I agree 100%. With no growth big block will likely reduce the node number.
But remember the system is dynamic, big block mean more Tx, more users, more business, more merchant and ultimately more demand for node.
Bigger block can mean more node.


Growth will take care of the decentralisation.

Openning LN channel is like openning a payment channel,
You lock Bitcoin with your counterpart and all payments together are off chain (within limit of your blocked coin), only if your counterpart is a "hub" then you can access other and stay off chain.

First I do understand all your arguments and point of view on this, indeed if by remaining small it is the strongest and at the most most decentralised state then it would be the preferred state for bitcoin.
And I think we disagree on that.
If bitcoin remain that small in 10 years it is dead.
No more mining reward, not enough fees for the miner.
There is many way bitcoin can be successful by growing one or two order of magnitude (your feared "centralised" bitcoin is one indeed but also a many way bitcoin can grow and stay decentralised).
Most importantly it will be sustainable.
There on there other hand there is only one way bitcoin can stay small and remain sustainable.. The only solution in that scenario is to get rid of the 21 millions coins limit keep inflation to keep supporting hashing power... 
To say it with other words keep paying mining by inflation as fees will not be enough anymore. 


As I said it's not.. it's giving up on Bitcoin.


Decentralisation is not guaranteed by staying small. this is unrelated.
In any example of free market decentralisation tend to increase in growth time (because there is more business opportunity) and tend to decrease in stagnation time (because the only way to get market share is to increase efficiency, decentralised system are inefficient so business consolidate (centralisation)).
One question if bitcoin is 10x bigger with 10x more full node Is Bitcoin stronger or more fragile? 


With competition for block you are limiting some bitcoin usage by doing so limiting the fee income.
(By limiting by say 80% of the business you have to hope that the remaining (20%) are willing to pay more that more than 5x more to get equilibrium, you never increasing business by limiting user case)


If LN come as good as it is advised and all economy move to a 2nd layer network, there could never be competition for block space. You can settle an unlimited amount of Tx with 2 Tx in the blockchain..
Basically an unlimited amount of fees can be removed of the mining income.
Say it cost 50$ to settle in the blockchain and you settle say 20000Tx (at current price it is: 3,8 BTC about 1300$) it cost you 100$ to settle 1300$ of fees and a massive loss for the mining industry. 
At that point why bother settle? and there it go away the block space competition..


I would say the strength of the bridge is unrelated to its size but is related to its construction. ONLY if it is strong enough we should build on top of it OR ONLY if building on top of it make it stronger (as LN can if it is used as it was designed first for micro-Tx only)
Again the system is dynamic and anti-fragile, by getting bigger it gain resilience..
And staying small is not option..

It will have to be compared to the Bitcoin liquidity at that time. So in the worst case scenario if 1millions coins enter the market (very very very unlikely to happen even if the coins get stolen) it will be likely many times bigger than what the market can "digest".
Send the price to near zero I guess..
With that being said I agree with your point.
@_date: 2016-05-22 11:28:47
No transactions history doesn't multiply...?
If **one more Tx** is added to the network your node has to verify and record **one more Tx** so you have the complete transaction history.
Your resource requirement has increase by one increment not multiply.
@_date: 2015-10-12 15:32:51
It's interesting because if really there is a cost by single Tx added by a miner to a block then it's a good argument against any block size limit.
@_date: 2015-10-01 13:39:11


Then I am all for it, 
As long as LN stay optional it would give time to mature. Prove itself.


It might the price to pay for decentralised crypto. It is unlikely IMO that LN will be mature in time to keep the block limited to 1mb and Bitcoin staying functional.
People forget about growth, *we need growth*, it's very important part of making it much stronger. Bitcoin is now very small now and can easily be destroyed by banks simply by a big *pump and dump* that would bearly show on their balance sheet...
And also if growth bring 8mb blocks I can tell you nobody will complain about the cost of running a node!!! 


Agreed but none of those options are available. 
I actualy agree with the rise to 2mb then 4mb then reassess, this would give a chance and time to all options to deploy.


I am not sure we understood each other on that point. What I meant is I would need a huge amount of friction from the blockchain to move all my coin to LN. 
Because my coins are now 100% safe and I don't send frequent Transactions I have little reason to lock my coins in a channel as I suspect many other bitcoin user also.
(but might change if I use bitcoin in a daily basis)
Edit: LN doesn't fit my user case now; it might fit it in future when bitcoin will be usable on a daily basis but to get there it has to scale first.
(Added for clarity)
@_date: 2015-10-20 13:39:47
Actually I don't think it is possible to set a fix amount of fees because if the value of Bitcoin increase a lot Tx fee might get too expensive..

Skepticism is suspicion of what **is** status quo too.
A skeptic person would not believe in conspiracy. (Unless proven true)
I am really skeptical of any conspiracy theories. 
But I firmly believe that with all good intentions you can create a (financial) mess.
One example for the inflation rate look how it is calculated and decide for yourself if it is a realistic calculation of the "cost of living"
Housing is not part of the calculation (is it not part of the cost of living?) and several tweeks are added to the final calculation. (Too long to detail here)
No conspiracy here, you can check for yourself the information is no secret and yet the inflation rate seriously reduced (artificially IMO) to the point of being meaningless.
@_date: 2016-05-21 07:38:10


Well you don't need to be condescending,
I replied to you in another message.
What you discribe is an exponential increase in cost due to an exponential increase in **demand**.

With BIP101 gigabloblock will not be allowed before 10-15years.
And remember it is the block size limit not the actual block size.
And really if Bitcoin network get big enough to fill a gigabyte block of Tx in 10-20 years that would be fucking glorious!

@_date: 2016-05-21 04:51:40
Well ultimately it's all FUD on both side:
Fear uncertainty and doubt and it's normal because bitcoin and cryptocurrency is still mostly unproven and unknown territory.
On side fear that if block get bigger bitcoin will centralised and think original vision is incomplete or broken.
The other side fear that with a cap on growth bitcoin will never get sustainable (mining paid mostly/entirely with Tx fee) and think the original vision of bitcoin is complete but need growth to be achieved.
One side think growth can kill bitcoin the other think growth is necessary for bitcoin to work.
That would be the best way I can summarize the situation.
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:57:17
I don't want to talk about block size but you seems to imply that capacity issue can be fixed by better software wallet.
1MB is 1MB limit, as long as Bitcoin can still be an useful and a valuable crypto on 2/3Tx worldwide I agree.
If Bitcoin ecosystem start to fail because it need more than 2/3 Tx/s no matter how high the fee are or which software you use, it is a capacity issue.
@_date: 2015-11-07 08:40:09


It's increasing the block size **limit** and not the actual **block size**


Not necessary, you guys argue that there is still plenty of capacity available on the blockchain so why fees are not zero now?


There is no guarantee there will be those extra transactions.
You seem to assume you can make money out of a business by restricting it.
More fees will be collected if fees are low and capacity available. (More user case possible)
@_date: 2015-11-10 19:15:34


Yes, it does. You said yourself above:
I do see the user case too. Some kind of digital gold and even at 20$ fee it would still beat the traditional system in some case.
In the second quote I was talking of future possible bitcoin use.


I think a most more relevant comparaison is the pessimist/optimist view, nicely put up here:


Somehow people think bitcoin now is strong sustainable, resilient.
And it will not be as long as it as not grown few order of magnitude.
A bank can kill bitcoin before the end of the day with spending only pocket change, (a pump and dump big enough would kill trust in any crypto..)
Mining reward will disappear.. And if the fees revenu are going to LN hubs instead of miner the system will break down..
In your example your are advocating for building a bridge on top your 1-lane bridge with the first one not being consolidate.. 
And I am advocating for the 8-lanes bridge and get it consolidate and sustainable.
@_date: 2015-11-08 19:52:15

They could but they have no single person to target (thanks decentralisation) LN *might* give them a target.

In a case where all/most of the fee income go to 2nd layer solution and the mining revenu will drop below the sustainable level that might become (sadly) a reality for bitcoin.

LN is no way near ready.
@_date: 2015-10-01 09:33:17
This is where I disagree with you guys.
For two reason:
1-- that would mean Tx can only be send by LN in the future. 
Making bitcoin rely on a entirely new system. 
Unproven, no even coded and that will *inevitably* bring new unforeseen issue (it is inevitable of any complex system to bring unforeseen issue, that's why "mature" system are more trusted)
**This really is nothing less than a gamble**
2-- Because somehow people think that can fix friction by adding more friction.
For LN to scale the blockchain you basically need to lock all your coins for a very long duration. 
-Long time to build up enough Tx to compensate for the two multi-sig tx to open and close my channel otherwise you bloat the blockchain. How many you need 4,5 or 6 regular Tx to start saving space in the blockchain? this would mean months with my current usage of bitcoin.
-You will need to put most/all your coins in the payment channel to prevent opening and closing your channel too often and bloating the blockchain.
For me to move my coin out of cold storage the Transaction fee will have to be sky high and LN robust as hell!
Even then as I send about a Tx a month (beside buying from exchange) I would probably keep my coin as they are than locking them in a unproven system and with what it seems to me a rather troublesome user experience.
But my opinion would be very different if we raised the block size limit, introduce LN, let it a year or two to prove itself.
As you would expect from sensible engineer and designer *let the system mature.*

Now that the network close to full capacity it much easier and cheaper to DDoS the network.
@_date: 2015-11-07 15:24:22


I do see the user case too. 
Some kind of digital gold and even at 20$ fee it would still beat the traditional system in some case.
The issue I have with is that we have no control on that. Only the market will decide if bitcoin will get used that way in the future.
It's not clear that bitcoin keep being appealing to new user with high fees. Will bitcoin be still able to attract enough fee income with a restricted capacity?
Other crypto will have a very easy feature to provide in order to compete: capacity.
Especially some crypto share almost same DNA so merchant switching will not be difficult.

That mean if a new user send or receive 5 Tx with bitcoin, your node will have 5 more Tx to validate and record.
Not 45 more, like you suggest...
linear not exponential.
@_date: 2016-05-21 05:36:12


No this just wrong.
From a node user perspective more users mean **adding** more tx to the blockchain the growth is linear not exponential, mining is unaffected by the number of users.
Adding more users diminish the overall cost of operating the system has mining cost are spread over more users until block reward is not needed anymore. (+linear increase cost of running a node)
And you get an inflation-free cryptocurrency.
No other way around if you cannot spread the cost of mining to user the only other way to fund mining is to increase inflation (increase block reward).
Then bye bye digital gold.

I doubt that you can say than LN is better than big blocks.
The system is not out and it centralise data thought hubs; that point is critical unless LN is anonymous it is likely to bring issue.
KYC for node operator; node selling your payments history to make an extra bucks (payment history are the most valuable personal data nowadays) and likely others..
Only thing that can be said for sure is:
-LN is more efficient than blockchain payments 
-Blockchain is more regulatory resistant than LN
That's my main issue with LN,
Ps: and about making money do the math you will have to process a huge amount to make any significant amount of money (unless there is high fee per Tx)

@_date: 2015-11-07 16:42:50


Not for me so far.. (I have done it only in Norway, so I don't know for other place)
I pay 1% fee to buy the bitcoin and I charged 2% fee to sell for NOK (Norwegian Krona)
For a similar amount of money my bank charge me 4€ plus an exchange rate around 8%-9% worst than XE.com
All that can add up to 10-15% depending on how cash I withdraw.
I gain 1% using BTC to get NOK, I loose between 10-15% using EUR to get NOK.
(used XE.com as reference)

XT is Bitcoin Core plus patch, how can it fall behind??
@_date: 2015-11-11 23:45:31
Interesting but still I fail to understand how you get any financial gain pushing this attack.. Enough to risk your reward.. And potentially two block reward..

Equal distance, any chance you can eli5?

Hahaa! The would a killer!!

This limit was always meant to be removed...
The hard fork was always planned, by satoshi himself.
@_date: 2015-11-05 03:11:43
Sure I understand that I think it's dangerous and counterproductive,
Bitcoin need to grow to be sustainable, 
Restricting it, thinking the network is somehow strong now is a big mistake..
By getting big the network will get stonger, more resistant to financial attack, more useful, sure some node will drop but more will connect, more fees will pay the miner... Etc...
The system is not static, if there was zero growth then I would agree...
@_date: 2015-10-19 13:59:49
Holy sh**t!! 
I want that!
@_date: 2015-10-03 15:17:28


Indeed but thats the only neutral, distributed and decentralised way to do it.
And there is no other way, 
As every node keeping a copy of every transactions there is nobody is responsible for a making a transactions possible beside the sender.
On the other side with LN you are still responsible for the transaction you send but also the LN node that has processed it too and this is a regulatory weak spot.


The issue here for me, like everything in Bitcoin, it's all about game theory= what are your incentives?
LN node will be run are a business and they will process the most valuable personal data there is: your payment history.
There will be incentive for LN to attack your privacy, not saying that they will do it, but the incentive is there.


It think this would all be solve if LN payment were anonymous but I don't think this part of the LN project. This would make LN a real killer. (KYC, privacy.. all fixed!)
But that will likely come will more data the settle in the blockchain.. 


Not saying LN node has to be big or small, just saying if you want to make any significant amount of money out of a LN it will have to process a lot of Tx...
1223 Tx got $ 51.76 (Block  at current fee price.
 
@_date: 2015-10-12 07:55:43
It's a very key question how to define SPAM.
I wished the Bitcoin core dev team give a **clear** definition of it.
As it seems some see very useful Tx as SPAM.
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:25:59
I have read that 90% of gold value come from speculation,
And yes gold as many usage. (industry etc..)
@_date: 2016-07-06 10:27:45
Yes but it's still up to the miner to mark a block as "timestop" when a block is full due to SPAM attack or whatever non-normal conditions.
They clearly have a incentive not to, as fees will raising a lot in such conditions.
@_date: 2015-10-29 08:51:00


This would be good indeed.
@_date: 2015-10-04 19:11:56
I am not quite sure why your are upset.
It just say that sidechain and lightning network are not scaling system.
Nothing unrespectful or insulting, it is a reasonable statement that can be argued. Then people can argue if it is right or wrong.
It is healthy that LN get discussed in detail.
I personally think his statement is correct.
LN is not scaling solution (it doesn't increase the blockchain capacity) it is a optimisation solution (it is meant to reduce the load on the blockchain). The key difference is you need people to send frequent Tx for the LN effect to kick (otherwise it might even bloat the blockchain). 
Bitcoin need to grow first and get some wider adoption for the LN to do his job.
Again I might be wrong and that can be discuss..
@_date: 2015-10-02 11:18:42
Then you have to define what is an acceptable size.
I am actually for the small block size limit increase "the conservative approach" "; I think there is little chance LN will be ready and mature before 1MB get saturated.
@_date: 2015-10-30 09:03:32
Is it? Any chance you can elaborate?
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:35:28
An entire nation would be challenging for L2 also,
Decentralised routing have some scaling difficulties too...
@_date: 2015-10-05 09:29:35
This is incorrect.
No hash power is required to process transactions.
Transactions processing (validity, propagation, double spend check) is done at the node level.
Miner hash power job is protect the blockchain, making "hard" to revert Tx.
They are not an intermediary.
Less hashing power doesn't mean less Tx processed it mean the blockchain is less secure.
@_date: 2016-07-21 14:29:51


If anything bitcoin has been shown to be rather easy to tamper with..
Complete redesign to a low cap blockchain without community consensus and use of "soft fork tricks" to go around protocol limits for example.
If Hard fork are dangerous, how getting around protocol limitation using soft fork would not?
@_date: 2016-07-17 09:54:00
Then it would be great if rbitcoin made its moderation log public and discuss openly of auto-moderation setting.
As Roger Ver did.
The more transparency the better.
@_date: 2016-05-22 08:25:50
It does, 
there is nothing in your exponential growth reasoning that is blockchain specific.
If every users of a network send messages to every single other user then a linear increase in the network size lead to an exponential increase in resources.
Same goes whatever it's bitcoin, paypal, LN or even emails or text messages.
@_date: 2015-10-29 08:11:28
It all depends on your usage.
But a large amount of money received on my my channel I won't wait to settle it to the blockchain.
(Say you have an accident or whatever happen that your internet is off for a long time and your counterpart knows it..)
What about your wage?
Better on the LN or on the blockchain? Good question..
@_date: 2016-07-25 12:01:46


You might want to learn about the Dunning-Kruger effect.
Your strong certitude to be all knowledgeable might indicate to you are at the top of "mount stupid" in your econmics/cryptocurrency learning path.
A bit more modesty and respect help communication..
And not such loaded sentence...


My two satoshis..
@_date: 2015-10-18 09:16:27
On a side note.
Internet connectivity is a lot more random that poor countries poor connection and rich countries fast connection,
As said in a comment in this post Australia has no unlimited internet (there is allways a cap) making it hard to run a 1mb node and I have been I some poor countries with fast and reliable internet..
(It seems when the country let the free market freely compete, whatever if the country is poor or not, as much more of an impact on internet connectivity)

Hope we get a bit more fee revenue for the miner by then..
@_date: 2016-07-08 15:22:20
Well not much detail...
@_date: 2016-07-17 10:03:28




It's auto mod setting, same applies here.
BTW roger ver changed the setting on your request, not so dishonest maybe,
I don't think you will get any change in setting/policy here not even talking about transparency..
But it's great you guys get some exposure to rbtc effort to transparency.
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:54:43
I think you still need the complete record to validate the blockchain,
I don't think you can download the pre-pruned blockchain.
And some other used of the blockchain might need you to keep complete record of it; but someone that know better can maybe give more details.
@_date: 2016-07-30 14:08:19
A balance has to be found,
Ultimately PoW has to be paid by transactions fees, whatever people use their transactions for doesn't matter what matter is being sustainable without inflation.
You cannot be digital gold with large inflation...

Do you agree their (loaded) choice of making classic discussion as an altcoin?
@_date: 2016-05-25 13:01:05
Saying than bitcoin has infinte patience is wrong, it need some level of adoption to pay for the long term cost of PoW.
If it stagnate it dies
@_date: 2016-05-21 04:56:15


If difficulty drop it will take longer to get the adjustment and likely even longer to clear the backlog as the will be little capacity left to clear it..
@_date: 2015-10-11 21:39:01
Why volume wouldn't be a good indicator?
To me it's one a the most reliable indicator of Bitcoin adoption.
(Other can be easily gamed)
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:54:04
Nothing official, only forum discussion AFAIK.
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:45:47
Unlikely if miner decide to fork they will let the small chain operate,
They will attack to be sure the whole Bitcoin economy follow them.
@_date: 2016-07-21 14:36:45
They are .. by design..
Soft fork are easy, but they have silent consequences..

Well this the state of out community now.
There is little hope that will improve.

Is the defensive patent license still apply to this patents if blockstream would sell them? 
(In case of a bankruptcy for example would the buyer of the patents will still be only allowed to use this patents in a "defensive" way?)
@_date: 2016-07-06 06:30:52


Well in a LN "bank run" the transactions fee will go through the roof so I don't think miner will give any priority, the will just accept the higher bidder..
@_date: 2016-07-08 15:18:40
And it kinda give a guarantee that nobody will brute force an adress because any attacker would be better off being paid to provide bitcoin PoW.
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:43:26
If 95% of hash power decide to fork the 5% fork has no chance to survive.
The 95% chain miners can mine empty blocks on the small chain without loosing much ressources, effectively stopping the smaller chain. (It probably possible to merge mine on the small chain, so they will not even waste revenue..)
If they don't it will so cheap to reseverse the transactions history on the small chain (51% attack) that coins in the small would not have any value..
@_date: 2016-07-06 06:41:22
You will have miner to cooperate to do that.. (They have to mark the block as"timestop")
With fees increasing massively if they don't, they will have little incentive to do that..
@_date: 2016-07-17 20:06:00
And what have you against the -50 karma rules?
Doesn't it make sense, you have to be careful of the quality of your comments otherwise you are out.
@_date: 2016-07-17 20:46:52
Well in some other sub you cannot post unless you have 100+ karma..
I see nothing wrong in that.
I expected both rbtc and rbitcoin to have the same rules.. Otherwise what is the use for karma?
@_date: 2016-07-24 13:29:57
Well this chain is really unsafe with extremely low level of PoW to support it..
Therefore attacks are likely..
@_date: 2016-07-09 18:46:13
Cooling electrical??
You have that much excess power that you run elec AC?
@_date: 2016-07-09 22:39:12
Then it's probably a good idea to mine!
Well you will have night down time and maybe variable power available for it, it might difficult to set up still.
@_date: 2016-05-26 18:02:57
It is dynamic, but if there is something you don't want is a PoW currency to reduce its mining reward too much... I guess it can drop 2x maybe 3 or 4x.. but lower than that it will reach a point when it will start to be cheap to reverse the blockchain history (51% attack)
specially the more time pass the obsolete ASIC are accumulating...
@_date: 2016-05-14 07:15:09
Who would invest in that?
I guess it will be immediately forked if the source are open..
@_date: 2016-07-30 08:12:20
Well there is no way to scale LN to visa level why decentralised routing.. 
It is just the nature of decentralised system they scale badly, **all of them**
@_date: 2016-07-06 06:37:54
That would be the best scenario, with capacity available onchain, both on chain and L2 network can compete and find their optimim use case..
Edti: with no capacity left onchain normal users will price out of the blockchain and have no alternative than using L2
@_date: 2016-07-23 10:05:46
Me too,
For example when taking in account the full validating node numbers, only the node that includes all the soft fork should be given.
As older node are increasingly less capable the most updated, to the point old node are just zombies node..
For example with the segwit soft fork and assuming 100% adoption all non-updated will basically be zomby nodes, unable to verify transactions...
5000 nodes will not be a good number anymore if only 900 upgrade..
