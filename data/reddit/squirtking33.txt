fuckkkk. I traded my botcoin for altcoins at 6200, probably should of hodl
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:59:37
Is 900,000 okay on exchange?
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:31:56
Well, it had to be because I changed IP addresses and then I sent out to exchange. The problem is smaller amounts would work but then I'd have to do a 10 dollar fee on each send out which is dumb. Rahter send all of it out and pay just one fee but doing this causes the security feature.

So, I should move to chile

After fork
@_date: 2017-10-28 03:11:39
What do you use?
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:18:43
Is it safe to leave on coinbase, while they sort out authorization, what ever the fuck that means. I swear Coinbase is owned by the federal reserve. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:00:43
TAKR CONTROL, TAKE CONTROL B4 ITS TOOO LATE
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:58:17
I'd duckduckgo or searx it. Google can suck dick. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:44:08
I believe it does. It justt will take a day or two, Also, are the fees on coinbase really 10 dolalrs now? 6 months ago they were around 4 I think. I sent out 500 and coinbase took 10, so in the exchange last month I had 490. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:06:44
Okay, but obviously you have to upload your ID or write in your SSN for GDAX, correct? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:58:29
For a few days on exchange??? On coinbase is that okay
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:16:49
I just transfered bitcoin and its pending. You think coinbase is evil enought to hold it until thr fork. They wouldn't right!
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:18:58
Lets hope coinbase doesn't keep my btc in pending for three weeks
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:50:46
It's just accounting. It's faith based.

@_date: 2017-10-30 02:20:52
Because he was always suppose to be president well before he was elected. Nobody, can hold power, without blackmail. TPTB won't allow it as blackmail, such like that of scientology makes a mallable, easily manipulated puppet. Look what happened to JFK, with his executive order regarding the FED and Operation Northwoods.

It's the illuminati.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:17:48
Do you know of an exchange that does not make you put in social security and banking info and id, etc? Poloniex good? Just sooo much research trying to find out which exchanage and wallet is most private. For instance bitcoin fog mixer might even be a honey pot, don't trust them at all. I care about financial privacy and it has nothing to do with any sort of illicit acitivites, just do not like tracking. Kind of creepy in my book.
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:02:37
Also, what's the best way to sell a bunch of bitcoins in bulk. Is localbitcoima decent? And last week I had to shut down my bank of america account because they sort of refused to do bussiness with me. They are not fond of bitcoin I guess.
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:01:12
I'm new here. So, basically if I purchased 100 bitcoins and they were 10 dollars each I would have 1000 worth in usd. So, I would lose some money to get them. Now if I held them until now, I could get a payout of just under 230,000 if I sold all of them with the current price in usd. Help me out here. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:18:48
localbitcoins is too expensive it seems. I'll look into bitsquare, it is decentralized. And couldn't I shape shift from bit to monero back to bit? I figure monero is more private.
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:11:42
I posted that and didn't read your comment. cause I didn't refresh. Thanks, I appreciate the response.
@_date: 2017-07-10 07:21:30
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:22:55
nahh, amazon is pretty shit and tracks everything you do. That's why you buy the cards at a store with cash only.
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:00:27
But you have not yet? You might need to inform the IRS or get a lawyer if you make a decent amount. Yeah, true but mine as well buy some new cheap cryptos as long as you believe in the project. If I made enough bitcoin to afford a house, I would not know where to start or who to talk to. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:58:01
wallets from different companies?
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:01:49
Can you take a lot of USD out of exchange to your bank??
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:00:48
And then what, cash out the gold. And wouldn't this be seen by the irs.
@_date: 2017-06-21 04:19:33
Also, where you storing your coins. This Antshare windows wallet seems shit on security and privacy. Any like two-tier option. It's just a password. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 04:22:20
kYC, has ruined crypto, good things there are ways to get around it.
@_date: 2017-06-21 05:57:29
Do you think a strong encrypted USB stick is fine to keep private addresses and backups to wallets? I'd only open with wifi turned off. I need a trezor. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:11:11
I'm not though
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:57:42
AMAZON gift cards it is then. have yet to find an exchange in the past month that works.
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:14:38
Interesting, so you'd keep the crypto. And you can't cash out little bits of bitcoin to USD overtime? 
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:02:36
Does it work on antshare??? I'm honestly not sure how it works. It just stores all your private keys?
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:52:12
Just small amounts, and restock capital gains in other cryptos?
