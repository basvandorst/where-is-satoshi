Here's a fun one: [ 
C\-CEX is scamming people like no tomorrow. Ran away with all the XVG and many more beginning of December last year. Never to be seen again...

I transferred my left over btc from other online wallets to my physical HD and backup. This is not going to happen again.

Thanks :)

How afraid were you? :P
@_date: 2014-05-07 09:05:04
Yup, I definitely did.

It's the same password I used for my Adobe account. So I guess my credentials got snatched.

1.9 and some more digits BTC. I won't go bankrupt, but it stings. I feel violated. And yeah, I guess my password wasn't too safe. Numbers and letters string of 10 characters. I think not having 2 way auth was the issue here. Otherwise I would not have had this problem.

That's horrible :S

I mean, how do you even price things by then? Like, as a shop keeper, what makes you sell your apples for 35 gazillion and not 65 flabrillion dollars?

Put away in the basement and only talk about it at family dinners?
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:46:39
And then what?
@_date: 2018-07-16 13:10:36
That's the problem: still trying to couple the value to fiat. Don't. Bitcoin is worth what we deem it to be. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:49:55
Question is, what are you going to do with your BTC if the old economy has crashed? (serious question)
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:15:52
Think again
