You should diversify. Never smart to put all your eggs in one basket.

Adopt, don't shop.

Not as many that have lost I'm sure but probably some have done well

I'm so glad they sold at 12. Cuzz I sold and 20 and reloaded at 11. Thanks for panic selling.

Please for the love of god not credit cards.... I'm sure there are some people that have maxed out a cc on it though.

This is where I'm at. I'm cutting my spending on entertainment and replacing it with investing in BTC and alt coins. BTC / cryptocurrency is my entertainment.... hobby...... obsession.

TA is a planning tool, not a magic prediction tool. Its purpose is to help set up a plan regardless of the price going up or down. Nobody knows if the price will go up or down, but you can make a plan for what you will do if the price goes up, or down.

Just to comment on the weekend action...
My TA told me to sell at $7,580 and my support point was $6,600.

You're implying people only beat the market on the way up... which is not correct.
@_date: 2018-06-08 16:48:26
Let all the idiots bash TA when I'm up 5x in the last month.

Not necessarily. TA is built on probability and statistics and using proper risk management. The markets don't move because of TA, markets move because of human emotions (December see FOMO). TA is used as a planning tool and when combined with indicators it can identify situations in markets with a high probability of price action goin in a specific direction. People that dont have the necessary math skills just dont get it.

I love all the people that say TA is bullshit because they dont understand how to use.
@_date: 2018-06-09 23:07:34
Tell yourself whatever you need to.
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:23:56
Please explain how probability and statistics and risk management isnt math?

TA never says if X happens then Y happens. TA says if X happens then Y is more likely to happen than Z.

OP said he's only selling a portion of his BTC
