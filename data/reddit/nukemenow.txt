What people like you fail to understand is that to a lot of people a car is a hobby, community, and something they enjoy. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:31:20
Because to some people, cars are enjoyable. It's not about investing or return, it's a hobby!
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:32:39
Well I mean Mercedes have ridiculous maintenance costs and are much less reliable than most Porsches. So regardless, if you're looking for luxury, I'd go for a Panamera.

Whaaaat? Fluctuations were that big? Is that because of big betters or what? Is it usually bigger?

What do you mean by bitcoin casino investors?

Bitcoin will never be useful to 95% of people if transactions aren't cheap.
@_date: 2017-03-11 21:05:27
Why would it drop lol
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:16:12
what lol? ETF meant nothing
@_date: 2017-03-08 03:18:04
I need to know!!!
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:42:06
God you're outta your mind fam.
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:34:46
Interesting. Just seems inconvenient in a dev environment, no? What about Bitcore?
@_date: 2017-03-12 10:52:31
Interesting haha, it's a cool idea, but it seems like you'd have to invest a lot to make 10k/day? So my question is, you're not the owner of bustabit so how do you know exactly what they profited? Do they have an API or something?
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:15:55
Uh huh. Then bitcoin doesn't fit in anywhere.
@_date: 2017-03-13 06:26:56
eli5 pls?
@_date: 2017-03-13 05:51:21
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:41:42
I can't suggest one, but I believe the term is tumbling. Google that.
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:03:52
Okay, I've looked at this and it seems complicated. Do I really have to download the whole 200gb of blockchain and run the node? Seems like a lot of bandwidth.

@_date: 2017-03-12 11:03:04
Ah I see. Your site is dope, it's cool what you do and super helpful! Does a site like Primedice make more in reality because it's a bit less crazy than bustabit?
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:47:49
You're wrong lol.
@_date: 2017-03-12 09:25:34
Super curious, not sure if you're willing to share, but could you give a ballpark of what you took home that month?

Core has done nothing but improve and raise the price of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:21:42
Wow, you're nuts. Bitcoin merchants have been exploding where I live. Also in China &amp; Japan more than ever. You really are in another world.
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:19:01
Stop reposting this. It's WAY too big of a number. We want the most relatable unit to cash.

Huge companies get hacked all the time lol
@_date: 2018-06-18 04:36:49
I dunno, maybe they realize if they touch it it could crash the coin and the future of it.
@_date: 2018-06-18 03:55:34
I just think it's probably likely it wasn't his/their only wallet. Probably had another one with at least what should be worth millions by now.
@_date: 2018-06-07 04:55:18
Old ones, or low production ones absolutely go up in Value. Porsche GT4 retailed at about $90K CAD and at their peak 6 months ago were selling for $140K+
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:16:14
Are you serious?
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:06:27
This post is so wrong lol
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:02:16
Back last October I sold all 100 of my BTC to pay for my yearly bills. Worth over 1mm CAD now...
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:15:44
Funny meme
@_date: 2017-04-08 23:49:14
What haha. IQ? What are you on? You're clueless, I'm out. Enjoy your pretend world.
@_date: 2017-04-16 08:02:26
Curious, but what incentive to miners have after the 21 million?
@_date: 2017-04-11 16:29:47
I mean cool article but they're definitely profiting WAY more than 300 BTC in a month collectively.
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:32:21
Lol. Provably fair is about the only way you can be sure you're not being scammed. It's definitely not declining, you have no clue what you're talking about lol.
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:30:31
Some of these sites pull in millions of profit a month, so yes it's not much compared to that.
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:27:47
Mistype obviously, I meant non provably fair. We're not talking about casinos in general though, we're talking about bitcoin casinos and sites like prime dice are probably banking over a million a month.
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:28:40
Entertainment? lol
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:44:34
There's practically none that accept bitcoin and clearly this article is talking about Primarily Bitcoin sites. At any rate, within a decade, people aren't going to put up with sites that can scam behind the scenes, it's just a reality man.
@_date: 2017-04-08 17:25:09
You're quite wrong, and it's funny. I can't think of a single popular non-provably fair casino. It really just sounds like you're trying to promote websites that scam people.
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:29:03
In Feb. 1.6 BTC was bet a second.
@_date: 2017-04-08 20:17:24
You might want to form full english sentences before you pretend to know anything about a multi-billion dollar market.
@_date: 2017-04-08 19:05:49
Of course they don't need it, owning a gambling site is very profitable but you'd be incredibly surprised how greedy people are lmao. If you also pay attention, most Provably fair sites run faster, are more interesting, and look better because of better developers and that will win out. It's ridiculous to say that a feature that prevents scamming with no real downsides isn't going to become more and more used haha.
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:54:52
I mean I run a provably fair site that gets 10+ million page hits a month and a profit of 500k~ a month, and I really don't get that vibe from a majority of users.
@_date: 2017-04-08 23:39:06
Changed to insults because you're angry? Nice.
@_date: 2017-04-16 08:33:46
DOes that mean they're going to get ridiculous?
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:54:28
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:41:00
$5 is still just the ridiculously overpriced fee calculated by shitty fee calculators...
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:41:49
That's how innovation like that happens. You choose to work there because you value what you're doing more than the money. Then after you get to put it on your resume and get hired anywhere.
@_date: 2017-10-22 09:51:39
Similar story. I sold out all 100 of mine last year  at $800~ Canadian and now it's worth 7700 CAD. D;
@_date: 2018-11-11 17:15:05
You people are so weird. People can spend some of their money and enjoy it. $50k out of a 500k windfall when you have a stable job and good finances is fine man.
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:32:18
I was making bitcoin as profit from my business and I made 80 of them last year, sold at 800 CAD, now it's 6000 CAD haha. Still was all profit, but damn!
@_date: 2017-10-12 06:23:48
Well I definitely wouldn't buy a lambo personally, probably a GT4 porsche. So like $150k. But you can have loads of fun like racing, autocross, drifting, rallies, roadtrips, modding, and participating in the car community.
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:32:09
I mean that'd be okay for commuting, maybe, but we're clearly talking about cars you drive.
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:24:58
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:12:30
Can someone eli5 what this is? Thanks.
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:23:36
No one is confident about that lol.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:48:38
Sounds like you actually have less than a bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:02:03
That's why you don't buy lambos. Cars like Porsches definitely are meant to be driven daily.
@_date: 2017-05-13 09:24:38
Can't use out of state?
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:46:33
Why would you sell lel
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:52:11
I have a 718 Cayman. Sure it costed about 90k, but it's my life and I love it haha!
@_date: 2017-05-01 09:50:53
Cause it's an gay exchange lol?
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:03:58
No it's not. 100% over is 2x.
@_date: 2017-07-11 22:11:33
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:04:16
You definitely sound like someone who just spent $20 on bitcoin and wants to show off...
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:08:40
Lol the Clintons didn't murder him.
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:15:34
99% of sites use JS. Maybe don't be visiting sites you don't trust? Or don't browse on a machine with important stuff? Or maybe just realize that JS isn't your  worry when it comes to being fucked over on the internet?
@_date: 2017-06-11 03:54:50
Is this your account? Did you buy all of them for pennies?
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:16:27
No they won't.
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:47:06
Lol, you're nuts. HODL
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:33:27
No, it's likely off-chain.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:14:42
Smart contracts aren't really actually that useful. It's never going to pass bitcoin lol

You can't use Amazon Stocks for anything.
