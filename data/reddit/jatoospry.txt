Do the opposite of what this guy says unless you want to be broke and homeless by the time their lawyers are done digging around in your anus for spare change.

So you prefer a "currency" that loses value for entirely random reasons? "Oh no, random chinese guy took a dump and Bitcoin dropped 300 bucks".

Let us take a look at the accepted definition for "volatile".


So let us look at the scenarios at hand of which we have been discussing:
1. The dow drops 4.6% in a day
This is a single drop in a market in which corrections and downward pressure have been expected for some time after a significant period of high gains. It has for the most part maintained a stable trajectory and has suffered incredible swings in value neither one way or the other on a regular basis.
2. BitCoin drops 14-15% in the last 24 hours
This is just one of hundreds of instances of wildly varying pricing swings at any given minute, hour or day when considering BitCoin pricing across the given exchanges. Since reaching a peak of around 20,000 these pricing swings have largely been in a downward spiral or you could say in a direction that is "especially for the worse".
Again, these things are not the same. However maybe if I was a coiner who was left "HODLING" the bag, I would tell myself whatever I had too as well in order to avoid facing reality. I guess we will never know.

I feel you are *this* close understanding the outcome of your own statement here.

1. The dow is down 4.6% 
2. Bitcoin is down 14-15% in the last 24 hours
3. Bitcoin is down 36% in a week
BitCoiners think these things are all the same.

Calm down. I am sure you will have enough time remaining in your life to rebuild after sinking all of your finances into ponzi coins.

I put twenty dollars into a slot machine once and walked away with 11,000 dollars.
May I interest you in my investment plan for any retirement savings you may have?
