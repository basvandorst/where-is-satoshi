Wtf is wrong with you? Are you a kid with no understanding of business whatsoever? If I steal a bunch of porsches do you think porsche will fucking compensate me for selling their cars? 
Grooveshark needs to make a deal with the administrative organisations who controls the revenue flow from royalties. Yeah, theres one of those in all countries. They havent, which is why grooveshark still is blocked and illegal to use in many countries. 
Spotify can do it properly. Pandora can do it properly. Youtube can do it properly. Why cant grooveshark? Because their library is build by illegal downloaded mp3s and they do NOT have consent by the copyright holders. 
My music (and others) is the foundation of their business and they stole it. Its very simple.

Why I care about my work being profited on without compensation to me and the other artists involved? It's my job man ... I make my money that way (not in this case though)

What...?! I am a music producer. I make music with a lot of vocalists/singers .... its their name on the tracks, not mine. Standard procedure since music wss invented.

Not american, everything registered. Royalties coming in from other channels with no issues

Fuck Grooveshark. Doesn't pay artists.

Movie theatres shouldn't pay for their movies either? Or Netflix? Grow up, kid. Thats not how the world works. Don't bother replying.

Producer .... not my name but the artists - bunch of different tracks/artists. Can't name anyone from my hate account .... will probably harm the artists one way or another.

Also ... grooveshark is (still) blocked in my country due to them not paying artists. It is blocked in a bunch of European countries.

I haven't seen a single cent and theyve got at least a handful of my tracks up for streaming.
