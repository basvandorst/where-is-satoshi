Am I wrong in thinking that all of Europe, not just Greece will be affected by the default of Greece causing the potential collapse of the euro? Even if the euro evades a collapses it's going to illuminate the half-arsed structure of their current uniformed currency. Bitcoin is a logical  successor to the euro in terms of fulfilling the purpose of a liquid multinational currency which is why I think it's had a greater adoption there than insular nations like America or Australia. Having said that bitcoin is far from consumer ready so I don't expect anything groundbreaking to happen as a result of these proceedings.

Yes, a lot of my friends are stoners but also heavy intellects. I'm also an occasional smoker and italian but I think you will find the latter my biggest downfall.

I really not think dogecoin was ever meant to be a legitimate alternate cryptocurrency.

I dont know what that means but I'm just looking to top up while prices are low so once my Nexus 5 arrives I'm ready to help the cause.

This would explain the recent drop in price. The Simpsons sure has lost its sheen.

I only have about .5btc and aren't a very active user (less so in the last few months) but regardless I've enjoyed waking up in the morning seeing btc is as sable as it were the days and weeks before and seeing a constant stream of headlines with new adoptions.

Well this is apparent, I would have thought all related files would be condensed to within the selected installation folder.  
Is there a config file I can edit to change this?

Coinjar is more than whatever bitcoinia. There are dozens of employees with millions of venture funding. I've met Asher (ceo) he seems like a smart enough guy not steal a lump sum of a few million dumping any future lost of hundreds of millions. 
Also coinjar isnt designed for bitcoin nerds. By all means they use it but if you poke around their feature set and design, they are trying for mainstream adoption and with that comes a rough transition they are burdened with making as smooth at possible. For example they have introduced hedge fund accounts where you can choose to hold a percentage of your bitcoin I another currency for those who fear the price volatility of bitcoin. This is definitely a feature for new people testing the waters.
I see your point though with the centralised holding. I wouldn't trust coinjar with my saving just like i wouldn't trust any online wallet services with it.

Bitcoin is a social network where you share currency. No china's allowed.
