Yeah which is what makes me nervous, this is also a 24/7 hour market. There's no telling which way the price swings once you're in bed.

I don't think it was coinbase per se, it was big time whales coordinating a big pump in conjunction with BCH being listed on coinbase, the extra push from all the fomo globally, and the FUD campaign against bitcoin in the media.
This happened in early November, when the flippening propaganda campaign was going viral, whales pumped the fuck out of BCH letting fomo take it's course.
The difference between then and now is that, there is a lot more volume and new buyers who aren't aware of what happened in the past. They are easily susceptible to propaganda, and traded BTC for BCH because they were terrified by the FUD campaign going on in the media. 
The biggest article to hit many news channels was bitcoin.com and the once "co-founder" of bitcoin saying he traded his BTC for BCH because bitcoin is useless (bitcoin.com is pro bitcoin cash - new user/ buyers don't know this).
So when they see a website like bitcoin.com calling it's own bitcoin useless of course there's going to be panic. 
It's hard to say if coinbase was part of this, but the timing in all of this was coordinated. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:03:45
Man Kraken is terrible, I lost money once on it because it crashed and had to sell at a lower price during the bitcoin cash crash early Nov. I use Bittrex, and haven't had a problem with it so far, it sometimes lags during crazy traffic hours, but what exchange doesn't? But it doesn't consistently crash like Kraken.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:32:01
Basically big money people who can control the price because they can pump it or dump it. For example if I buy 5 million dollars worth of bitcoins the price will pump up, and when people see the price of bitcoin rising they think the price will keep rising so this creates a domino effect of buyers moving the price up.
Once the price has increased by quite a bit I can sell the once 5 million dollars of bitcoin for 10 million if the price has doubled after the pump, so I make a profit of 5 million. When I sell 10 million if has the opposite effect so the price drops and that in turn has a cascading effect of people selling out of panic as the price drops.
Whales are basically big money players in the game who can manipulate the price with the huge amount of money they have, essentially giving them some control over the market. A high market cap won’t affect the price much by one whale action, but if a bunch of whales decide to sell and buy at he same time, there can be a lot of price movements.

Correction, people stopped buying at an all time high so they are selling before it goes lower and want to cash out in the correction and probably buy lower.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:36:18
At what price?
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:30:26
Yes there has. There has been 4 this year if you look at these pops in terms of percentage, and not in terms of USD drop in value.
What you see here are whales trying to capitalize on weak hands en mass because here were a shit ton of newbie investors who would inevitably panic. It’s timed perfectly with the bitcoin FUD campaign in the media. This massive correction was necessary, it went up waaay too fast. 
Most sensible investors guessed it would be 8k by end of the year, but we got to 20k. It may drop to 10k or even 8k but it’ll make a rally from there. It cannot grow if it was still at 20k that’s just too fast.
I actually think the price should be lower, it’s still too high, but that just shows the incredible buying power behind bitcoin. A big correction has happened at the end of every year - there were just a lot of new blood who had no idea they were buying it overpriced.
We can agree to disagree, but New Years and onwards is where we should be looking ahead for the next bull market.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:10:49

The rich get richer, it’s an easy game for them because that amount of money controls the market. We are at their mercy unless you hold strong, every strong rally they’ll attempt to shake off the weak hands, and the weak hands always pay dearly, while they grow in wealth. 
This is why the hodl meme is thrown around all the time, a newcomer who attempts to time the market, and try to profit from the whales often get fucked big time. It’s like trying to beat the casino at its own game, you’re more likely to lose than win.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:28:20
Being in bitcoin for a while if it goes down that fast, it will probably go up just as fast. I can see it hit nearly 20k this time by NYE's, too many newbies and weak hands are getting shaken off by whales. And it's the perfect time to shake off the weak hands with all the FUD between bitcoin and bitcoincash.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:36:48
Wow you really are that dense, lol okay i'm done here. 
Hint: trying to goad me into explaining to you why bitcoin is valuable after me taking issue with your comment about bitcoin and casino gambling is a straw man. THAT IS talking about something else.
Bitcoin is nothing like casino gambling, you have tools and real world events to help understand the price. You probably have no idea why bitcoin was dropping today.
If you really want to know I'm invested in ETH, and several other cryptocurrencies, a small amount in bitcoin, and I have my reasons. But i'm going to say this again - anyone who compares bitcoin to casino gambling is either full of shit, or just dumb enough to parrot anything the media says.
Oh and I didn't get lucky with bitcoin, I built my stack up from a small amount by trading, so I already know you're bullshitting when you're comparing it to casino gambling.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:26:01
You're starting a straw man argument here buddy, I take issue with this comment "You have better odds putting all your money on black or red in a casino," and once again you're full of shit. For someone who works in finance for so long it makes no sense to me that you would make such an idiotic comment.

I don’t think you understand, I’m not gambling bitcoin off of 1/8 odds, 12.5%?? How is that even considered a good odd. I’ve safely traded my stack up to 3 bitcoins for a few months. I never went all in, never my entire stack - that’s foolish.
I look for altcoins with great potential, power ledger, cardano, iota all have great tech and future potential, they have worked with or have been endorsed by big companies like Bosch, Microsoft etc. and news like this is guaranteed to increase the price of those coins. I trade based on a coins potential. I’m not gambling 50/50 each time I make a trade, it doesn’t work like that. And I’m sure as hell not going to make 3 trades in a row if my chances of success are 12.5%. I also back up all my trades with all the necessary technical analysis. These are safe trades that have been 100% successful for me.
Don’t get me wrong I’m invested in some alts like power ledger and iota, and I think they’re great long term. But I’ve also used them to increase my btc stack. It’s hardly casino style gambling if you’re doing the research on the crypto currencies you’re trading/investing in.

Right I can agree with a lot of what you said. But it's dangerous precedent to just equate bitcoin to casino gambling, the mainstream news who call it that is being completely irresponsible and idiotic when there are a lot of people who have invested their money in it. That kinda of FUD campaign is going to make people lose a lot of their money.
I'd be okay with a more reasonable explanation of what bitcoin is, and it's potential, it's cons right now. But simply just call it casino gambling just disregards the whole complexity of what bitcoin really is, and it's downright bullshit. That's your typical sensationalist headline to grab people to read into fake news.
To call it casino style gambling is the reason why people get fleeced. A warning about investing in bitcoin is sufficient, but to spread ill informed FUD is dangerous.
And I totally agree with you on tether, it's so damn sketchy, I'd much rather the news focus on something like that which is a real concern. But to just call it casino style gambling sounds like a smear campaign. Lots of misinformation is being spread around.
And the BCH side of this is using it to their advantage, look at what happened just now. Tons of people just lost lots of money because of this FUD campaign, and BCH is being fueled by it. I don't disagree that it's gambling for most people, but I take issue with smear campaigns, and not actual news and information about bitcoin - also what potential solutions there are? and what we can do about it in the future? because the idea behind it is revolutionary, it's just not executed correctly.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:43:56
Honestly bitcoin needs an upgrade in tech before it is mass adopted as currency. Steam just stopped excepting bitcoin because of the insanely high fees. People are buying now in anticipation of that, but it will take some time I believe.

@_date: 2017-12-20 18:23:14
Dude stop, you’re not making a real argument by simply saying you’ve been here long enough to know that everything people dislike is market manipulation.
I’ve been here long enough as well, years and years, but I strongly suspect there’s coordination. The most popular article circulating around in mainstream news was an article from bitcoin.com sayibjow one of the co-founders has pretty much dumped his btc for bch. Within the same time frame CNBC and Roger Ver promotes BCH. Then you get the entire FUD campaign going viral on reddit, Twitter etc. So the value of BCH starts pumping, and BTC starts dropping
Coinbase’s surprise announcement of adding BCH trading adds fuel to the fire. So got another massive pump and dump we saw early November (during the flippening FUD campaign when segwit2x fell through), it pumps over 4K then drops back to under 3k within minutes. Coinbase said they would be introducing that in January, people were preparing for that within that time frame, but decided to surprise launch without any indication whatsoever.
This is so obviously market manipulation, and lots of people have lost money. The timing of all of this is highly suspicious, especially knowing that coinbase and Brian Armstrong were signatories of the segwit2x NY agreement, when segwit2x fell through all their attention went to BCH.

Man for someone who has been around 2013 you should’ve been through a dozen of these bubble pops. The idea behind a decentralized ledger isn’t going to die now, it’s just going to be further adopted and improved whether it’s bitcoin or not. 
It’s a revolutionary idea, it just isn’t going to go away. Banks have no choice but to adapt which is why many of them are looking into ripple, which defeats the purpose of a decentralized currency, but it shows they’re going to try and compete.
Bitcoin may die in the future, and I think it will be a while till that happens if they don’t improve the tech, and some other digital currency may become king, but the tech will stay and change our financial system. Too many of the new coins with better tech rely on it. It’s still the first mover.

There has only been a correction as big as this 4 times this year, all related to huge FUD spreading across mainstream news. The China ban FUD was one of them, and after a major correction it rallies. So this is based on bitcoin's major correction patterns this year.

I honestly wouldn’t worry about, it looks to me this is just an accumulation phase for whales. They’re buying up all the cheap coins the weak hands are selling, then pushing the price further down and scaring the shit out of the remaining weak holders by squeezing them out, and finally shaking them off for even cheaper coins. 
It’s been such an occurring pattern with these big corrections. I would only call it a crash if it drops all the way past 3-4k. This is just a massive correction, which was really needed.

The irony in trying to kill BTC is that BCH holders are killing themselves because of the brand association, too many stupid hardcore BCH holders don't realize this because of their tunnel vision in trying to destroy the original BTC - especially Roger Ver.

50/50 is too much of a gamble either way, I wouldn't have been able to make 3 btc from 0.5 BTC with those odds. I trade based on a collection of news, TA, and technological updates, and I haven't lost anything so far besides 0.1 BTC in the beginning when I was still testing the waters of this market. I think there is a future in cryptocurrency - especially Ethereum, and IOTA. Bitcoin needs to make technological updates soon otherwise these other cryptos will take over.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:49:43
Bitcoin is too big to be affected by that at this point, the one thing I think will affect the price is if big money institutions have been pouring money into bitcoin making this rally go up, and the shorting it big time when bitcoin futures open on CME etc.

I mean did you think it was going to keep going up vertically without a correction? I hope none of you fomoed after those pumps. That’s what these whales want you to do, that’s how they make money, and that’s how you lose money. Be patient and never fomo after pumps.

The big buyers who bought today's dip are just waiting for the fools to try buy it back up to 12k. Bitcoin needs a decent correction first without these fast pumps, I really don't like price movements like that. Reminds me of 2017.
If it does go back to 12k this fast it'll dump harder that's my guess.

Would you say Ethereum is a good bet to hedge with if it happens?

I don’t think it’ll drop below 6k. People underestimate how many strong hand holders there are now compared to months ago. I don’t see why this will be a bigger drop than the China market liquidating their bitcoins. We already drop from 7.8k, and that correction was inevitable. If people start selling their bitcoins under 6k (and I assume it will be those who just got high - over 7k), what do they have to gain? They’ll just lose more money.
Because the people selling under 6k are probably not going to be the long time holders who have been through this multiple times. It’s the newbies who are selling out of fear of losing more. I’ve seen this happen many times. That’s how I’m making sense of this.

Knowing the Koreans they’re all about efficiency and speed when I comes to technology. So it might be that there are a lot of new Korean buyers just moving into a new opportunity for cheaper coins compared to the high price of bitcoin. If there was a true flip then bitcoin’s price would be a hell of a lot lower.
The people freaking out and selling bitcoin aren’t the majority, and they’re at risk of losing money if bitcoin goes back up, and bch stabilizes or drops after this surge.

Yup buy when there’s blood that’s what I did when it dropped to 3k during the China market implosion.

I’m not sure you came to that conclusion. You can argue it’s similar to China price drop as well and it rebounded from there. It also rebounded from 2013. It’s really hard to take your analysis seriously when you’ve been posting fears about huge crashes “coindumper.” This isn’t what you call a “crash.” Correction after 7.5k was inevitable.
Lol at “its over”
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:40:58
Knowing bitcoin it will correct again and you will get a chance to buy, but probably not that low. It’s been up and down. If bitcoincash increase in price due to the fork upgrade today, and the change in hash rates to BCH, there might be a good time to buy. I have feeling whales are trying to opportunity during the price wars between bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:16:11
This also doens't include the new money from the newbies who are highly susceptible to panics and fomo, because they still don't know how the market really behaves. A lot of big whales take advantage of this, this is how they get richer by profiting off newbies panics.
30 billion dollars was injected into BCH, that amount is fucking insane, a ton of new investors got burned because of FOMO, they had no idea what they were getting into. A 100% increase in less than a day means you had to sell, that was not going to hold. I've never seen anything like that before.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:04:01

Yeah unfortunately a lot of new folks got in recently so it won’t hurt the long term holders as much because they got it so cheap, the price is still high for those who got in a couple of years ago.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:31:21
I gotta be honest here, I think you should stay away from crypto if you can’t handle the ups and downs, were you around when the China market imploded and banned all crypto related trading? The global market just bought up all their cheap coins within a month. 
This type of market favors the patient, and the people who lose the most are the ones who are most impatient and panic. I bought bitcoin about a year ago (yes I got in low), but I’ve seen this shit happen over and over again. All this panic is good for the strong holders who can buy more at a lower price.
Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. And get back in only if you can control yourself from panicking. Otherwise I would just stay away from this.

The advice about storing it in cold wallets sound so damaging in hindsight now. I had it on the exchange the whole time and I was able to get out immediately.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:41:21
Well you regret it now but what if it had gone up to 13k and corrected at 10k? These things are so hard to predict. Maybe only corrected to 11k, I don’t know how Day traders even Time this on a consistent basis.
@_date: 2019-10-15 16:21:17
Those stop hunts are for real.
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:41:18
Ya dude this is all easy to say in hindsight, and I don't think most people were shorting, most people were getting wrecked and margin called. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:01:51
If you've been around since 2012 what were your sentiment in 2014 with a similar crash?
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:39:03
Like everything else in here.
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:43:19
You realize this means most people have left around 10-6k? And the ones that are here have been in for more than a year, which is not the majority.

And the time Segwit2x got cancelled, so all of the 2x supporters poured their money into bitcoin cash accompanied by a huge propaganda campaign about how bitcoin cash will become the real bitcoin. These forks are bad news, and it sets back the crypto space.
@_date: 2018-02-24 03:59:39
No, nobody is wondering nor do they care.

Was this on the coinbase app? Sometimes I get duplicates after one purchase, but when I refresh or reopen the app it shows only one purchase. I think it might be a glitch, but I would double check with them to make sure.

Or they can try buy as much as they can and trade on foreign exchanges. A lot of VPN users in China because of all sorts of bans like this. This could push trading underground, and have their bitcoins moved to other exchanges outside of China. At least the ones who stand to lose the most may try this.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:33:06
I've actually been trying to look for some accurate stats on this, do you have a source showing how much cryptocurrency is being traded in China? I think it's important people know how much influence China has on this market. 10% seems surprising to me, I thought it'd be a lot higher.
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:37:20
Ah thanks for the clarification. I didn't know that, unfortunately my ledger won't ship until oct 15th. Not sure if I'll get it in time before the hard fork, so I'm a little lost as to what the best course of action is for this month I've been using the coinbase vaults until it's arrival. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:03:12
Right which is why many advise not invest more than you can afford. We don't know what the future holds. But a lot of people believe retailers will start accepting bitcoins in the future, it's a slow process right now - which is kinda why bitcoin is somewhat like digital gold.
Most are storing value, then there are people using it to buy stuff too, while the big time trader are trying to profit from the volatility of the price. When you buy with bitcoin you'd want to replenish w/e bitcoin you spent, because the value of bitcoin is volatile. It may go up or down the next day.
I still believe we're in the early stages. Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency is growing despite being a very rocky growth. Every year there seems to be new updates in an attempt to improve the technology behind bitcoin and its transactions, and of course there are disagreements over it, hence we get hard forks.
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:02:41
This sounds like something that doesn't bode well for the security of cryptocurrency if we eventually want mass adoption. I know too many people who haven't got a clue about internet security.

Well baakt is priced in as it was announced way back and hyped, so it obviously is a non-factor now. Everyone knew this which is why it pumped too fast to 14k.
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:27:28
Nice, how much was it back then? I got in at 4400 ��
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:27:56
Not sure if you even answered his question
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:13:15
I'm not for segwit2x either, but why do you need to resort to insult people? This does nothing but divide the community more. Try to keep a level head, insulting each other over disagreements doesn't help anyone.
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:36:00
If you aren't aware yet, most exchanges have this clause, not just coinbase.
@_date: 2018-04-13 02:47:26
Ok fine, if you want to argue with semantics, most people are terrible traders. Trader implies it's an occupation with income, and bad traders don't make income that way. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:10:57
Or multiple persons collaborating, or an institution
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:17:52
Yikes I still don't get why lots of people are shorting at this price though, professional traders I get, they know what they're doing, but that's maybe less than 1-5% of the people trading crypto right now. It seems so damn risky to be shorting BTC when it's already crashed so far.
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:14:16
Your average person is not a trader. A professional trader who makes income on this has probably been doing this for years and years. They're making bank because of the huge influx of average joes in the cryptospace thinking they could make easy money by trading without the necessary skill or experience. Most people are poorly gambling, not actually trading.
@_date: 2018-12-05 00:22:10
If everyone is expecting 3k, what are the chances of it actually getting there? Wouldn’t people just place orders higher than that price? There needs to be a catalyst for a panic drop down there.
