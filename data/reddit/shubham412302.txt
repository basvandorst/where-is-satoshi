My ROI just increased from 50 to 100 days at current rate. Hopefully alt coins or bitcoin increases in price.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:31:39
Now the BTC prices will rise hopefully
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:29:44
Such profound thoughts!!!!!
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:55:57
I hope bitcoin goes down pretty low and alt-coin soars and then in a few months when I have lots of bitcoins it passes the $20000 mark. hahahahah
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:30:42
Is it not the same with our normal currencies 
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:58:42
Now is the best time to invest in GPU and bitcoin. I feel bad for people who don't know that buying bitcoin at high price($19500) is actually a bad idea.
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:48:20
Its still 18000 yrs in the future
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:24:29
Then just hope alt-coins will be profitable
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:01:29
Welcome to the club.
I tried playing on gtx 1080 ti for relieving stress and thought this GPU is so overkill for 1080p gaming.
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:41:06
I spent Just 13 cents to send $5 on blockchain.info whereas you would require $5 for sending 5$ using coinbase.
@_date: 2019-07-09 06:57:27
I will HODL till atleast 100k
@_date: 2018-08-14 11:11:53
I sold all at $128.��
@_date: 2018-08-14 11:13:17
That's a bicycle.
@_date: 2018-08-14 11:11:10
You can replace 2017 buy 2018 and use this meme for next few years.
@_date: 2018-05-02 04:29:58
I think both are here to stay.
@_date: 2019-03-29 12:51:54
No. Many new coins are manipulated you just have to keep an eye on that. In India there is no tax unless you have cash credited. Even if I sell my 1BTC, $4000 is below the limit of taxable income.
@_date: 2019-03-29 06:32:33
I turned 0.001btc to 1btc by trading.
@_date: 2019-03-24 11:41:12
I stopped caring about BTC price as I can't control it anyway. I just keep on trading and increase my earnings in BTC till the day BTC 1M.
@_date: 2019-03-27 04:09:02
Stop using credit cards. Use Debit cards.
@_date: 2019-03-29 12:45:12
It took 6months. It not easy to earn so much on binance but it's easy on CB if you find the tricks plus thanks to RVN coin it was easier. I bought RVN at 220sat last time and  280-340 sat this time.
@_date: 2018-10-12 11:47:58
Stupid meme. Not everyone started buying in the beginning.
@_date: 2019-11-10 11:29:47
I have seen Bigly bt having 1biglybt in their BTC donation address.
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:55:13
I wish I would have sold at $19k
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:06:24
I don't even care about crashes anymore
@_date: 2018-06-11 03:39:42
I will wait for $25000
@_date: 2018-06-22 06:08:11
Hopefully all my shitcoins will also run along the BTC bull run.
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:07:49
I am HODLing cold wallet coins till 2025 even if time flow is the same.
@_date: 2019-02-26 14:31:16
I plan to HODL till solar flare.
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:04:18
You realize this truth only if you survived the bear market.
@_date: 2019-12-27 16:07:50
It was meant as a joke. Google is removing crypto videos from YouTube and metamask from play store.
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:05:05
Those were the great times. Trading few Satoshi shitcoins especially the ones below 10sat was easy and predictable.
@_date: 2019-04-08 05:51:12
'illegal' says Facebook. LOL
@_date: 2019-12-27 16:02:02
Removed from Google maps.
@_date: 2019-04-02 04:54:51
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:50:30
It was lower only because of high transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-11-23 09:50:52
Lol. Now make them HODL for 5yrs.
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:32:31
It's still better than 150k a year ago
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:34:22
Dominant, but never single.
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:41:15
@_date: 2018-02-13 11:24:05
I don't trust ebay.
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:41:12
What if even holders start selling during dip??
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:12:03
Itssss goingggg uuuuppppppppppp
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:37:42
The Dip Is Not Over Yet
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:22:23
It's just a misunderstanding.
After the Indian media's misinterpretation of Finance Minister's speech the Indians started selling bitcoin which result in price drop which created a effect where now everyone is selling further worsening our wounds
@_date: 2018-03-31 07:03:19
My friend just bought 0.1 bitcoin for the first time after seeing the prices are so low.
@_date: 2018-02-22 05:26:51
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:43:23
With us holders around Bitcoin will never reach 3k. ������
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:31:09
$10k soooooon
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:47:37
It was media's conspiracy. Especially Indian media for releasing fake news of ban.
@_date: 2019-01-25 05:31:09
That's pole star not moon.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:46:55
I will sell all my coins and invest in servers.
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:22:57
Blockchain.info takes only few cents for transactions
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:40:16


@_date: 2019-09-01 04:14:18
He is already regretting. He has to pay taxes for the Bitcoins he says he HODL. LOL
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:23:59
Hodlers are the only one preventing further collapse.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:55:49
Tera baap dega 15lakh tuzhe.
Everything he is saying is total bullshit. What kind government gives that much money to the citizens or promises to give?
@_date: 2018-04-02 13:36:39
This may be the best time to invest in crypto due to the low prices
@_date: 2018-04-04 00:11:03
My first payment took 15 minutes to get single confirmation and that was when my order was completed online. 2nd time it took a minute.
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:34:17
Imagine what she might do when she learns btc replaced $ in 2025.
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:13:55
USD is overpriced and they know it.
@_date: 2019-05-14 11:45:45
Human hearts are unfathomable and so no one will trully know. That's the reason I never read charts for trading. No one knows where whales will take us.
@_date: 2019-05-14 11:54:59
It was at bottom for so long (3200-3700). But people always want to buy Bitcoin when it's booming and is clearly are uncertain where it will go.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:00:20
There is no stopping the bull's momentum.
@_date: 2018-12-02 08:47:47
You should have sold in January.
@_date: 2018-12-09 03:26:50
That friend who bought in Dec had it worse.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:29:47
NSA is already spying on him
@_date: 2019-05-14 11:52:48
$50. A friend bought and sold at $600. He said it was easy money. I was just a college student and did not had that much money for BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:31:43
All those months of trading and HODLing during bear market since november paying Off.
