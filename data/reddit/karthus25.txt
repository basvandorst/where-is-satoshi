So what do you do when you don't have enough fiat to diversify?
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:38:35
With as little as $1000? Do I look like I have a rich dad who can give me a small loan? If I had $1000 I wouldn't be in credit card debt at the moment.

Because I bought bitcoin to use it for the first time as a cryptocurrency to buy something online, not as a freaking investment. Like wtf this is why it's so hard to get newcomers.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:37:40
Buy fiat through a bank transfer is the only way to buy any really.
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:54:00
So because I'm so depressed that I never got any bitcoins I guess I'll spend like 1/5 of my paycheck (literally only $25) to get some, :*) so what's the difference between BTC and bitcoin cash now? I have bitcoin cash for some dumb reason in my blockchain wallet when I had like $0.25 of btc in it before.

I did the same a few days ago to make an online purchases and I'm still waiting for them to come through, they aren't even worth whatnot purchased them at anymore so I can't even make my purchase for what I wanted to buy.... this is the problem with using bitcoin as a currency.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:54:51
Or like me, they wanted to get into bitcoin last week , got some, only to have the bitcoin they got value get cut in half resulting in newcomers losing money and not wanting to ever use bitcoin again.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:53:50
I bought at 14K, HOLDING WITH YA BROTHER.

Newcomer here, how do people expect other to use bitcoin when I just purchased bitcoin the other day to make an online purchase. I am waiting to receive them from coinbase and while I've been waiting the price has already fallen over $400 from the price I purchased them at. How do we intend to fix such fluctuating prices which drive away newcomers such as myself who just bought bitcoin that are now worth less than when I purchased them. Again this wasn't a purchase to be used as an investment, but to make an online purchase as there is a discount for using bitcoin with this merchant, but the discount doesn't matter if my bitcoin are no longer worth enough to make the purchase which I want to make.

Meanwhile I still haven't bought bitcoin and I hate myself for it, just gonna start tying a noose for myself now.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:50:10
I did not buy bitcoin as an investment opportunity, I purchased bitcoin to use it as a currency to purchase some things for my PC at an online retailer who gives a discount for using BTC , so pretty much everything you said is irrelevant as I'm coming in to use it as a new user looking at it as a currency to make an online purchase. Just saw your edit so editing mine too, but still, trying to make my point that the price fluctuations, especially a bug one like this makes it a deterrent for people to just keep their liquid assets, even if just a portion of them in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:14:17
Again, as a new user how is one supposed to know which cryptocurrency to buy when bitcoin is THE crypotcurrency that you hear about when you're new to cryptocurrency. If you guys want the public as a whole to get into cryptocurrency you have to dumb it down a bit to let everyone know how it works.
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:07:07
Thanks, just started a purchase with coinbase to get 0.0016 bitcoins, time to start up my savings lol

Dude I live in Austin but my house is just out of their delivery area for them...

You sneaky bastard, I almost didn't notice the link.
@_date: 2014-07-26 06:02:22
Nooo I'm in NW Austin, by the lake line mall :(
@_date: 2019-04-04 00:24:31
Yeah I just put $600 in at $5000 per etc, hope I didnt just make a mistake.

I'm 19, what are people who are in there early twenties and late teens? o.o
@_date: 2015-02-17 00:15:45
So would you be willing to do this with gay porn?
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:14:12
Honestly I would be okay with a mixture of both. I think that bareback is hotter, but it's obviously not "safe" sex. I think there should be a disclaimer like there is in porn about them consenting to doing it and a reminder about how blah blah blah is safer or whatever. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:01:17
YES! Thank you so much for this! I can't wait to cum get it!
@_date: 2013-08-25 00:06:28
I'm only 0.0003BTC away from retiring my mining for my first 0.01 btc from mining, this is just making it take    longer :(
@_date: 2013-08-25 00:45:47
I mine 50 mb/s with btc but i mine like 300kb with litecoin, I quit when I couldn't get 1 confirmation after 10 minutes. Is there an easier way to mine litecoins, because when I tried it was too complicated for me.
@_date: 2013-04-30 06:08:44
Well it is "free" on my part, but I don't want to be an asshole and raise the electric bill higher than usual.
@_date: 2013-08-23 18:06:26
Why? I would love to have gotten an allowance and get paid for all the chores I do. I'm 15, I need money to buy things, and I can't get a job unless it's summer and I actually get accepted since I have literally nothing on my resumé (no work experience). The only think worth noting is that I have my adobe certifies associate in Photoshop. When/If I have children, your dam right I'm going to give them a weekly allowance or at least pay them for the work they do so they learn that they need to work to earn things. Obviously a little kid doesn't need much but at my age I need it if I ever want to go out or buy personal items. The reason I don't get anything is because I get told "Do you pay rent? If you start getting paid you're going to have to pay me rent" by my father. I literally have no work ethic since I get no reward for working so I don't really try when I have to do things now.
@_date: 2013-10-03 01:06:16
If prices do drop, maybe I'll actually be able to have at least 1 or more bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-08-23 22:31:35
Wow you guys are so nice but it's fine really, I just talked to my dad and he said that I can print out whatever I like in his office, all I have to do now is put my Photoshop classes to good use and make a design that I can use. Thank you for offering and being so nice though!
@_date: 2013-08-13 23:08:50
As someone who is bringing 50 MH/s, I quit after I reach my 0.01BTC goal, just 0.001 BTC away!
@_date: 2013-08-14 05:51:04
What AM I using. I'm using my graphics card, [NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 Ti from Gigabyte.]( I don't use it to mine 24/7, only when I'm using my computer. I want to try and actually use bitcoins but I have no way of adding funds, so I'm trying to mine for my first 0.01BTC mining in the BTC Guild pool. 0.00901333 saved up so far, It'll take me a couple hours to get to 0.01, but I'll be using my computer anyways so why not?
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:44:47
Could I ask what a vanity address is?
@_date: 2013-04-30 06:02:18
Yes I thought so, I never even used but coins yet so I'm trying to get 0.01 and try to use it and see how bit coins work more closely.
@_date: 2013-08-23 20:35:52
Wow this is the most generous thing that anybody's done for me... I'm speechless... Thank you so much. So far I've been mining for my first 0.01btc and am almost there. I always wanted to put up fliers around the neighborhood for computer repairing but don't have a printer and school printers cost 10 cents per black and white page and can't be used for non educational purposes. I wonder if there's a print shop near my home and how much it would cost, or even use the btc you just gave me to order printings if that's possible. I'm going to get into AP computer science this year at school so I wonder what I could do with basic computer science skills. Once again thank you very much, this is the biggest and most generous gift that a stranger has ever given me.

Did it sound like death itself?

I wish I got an allowance and got paid to do chores :/
