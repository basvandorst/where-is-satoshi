If it is important for the btc to arrive at the receiving address within 3 days, I wouldn’t be comfortable sending with 45 sat/b. There could be a rise in the amount of transactions above the fee you choose at any moment, but the lowest fee I’d send would be 100 sat/b.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:22:59
If the transaction is high priority, i’d recommend sending the transaction with a fee of at least 200 sat/byte to ensure the tx gets confirmed in a reasonable amount of time. The amount of btc being sent doesn’t really matter. It’s about the size of the tx aka inputs. 
Quick maths: 226 (1 input) x 200 (sat/byte) = 45,200
45,200/100,000,000 (there are 100m satoshis in 1 btc)
Network fee to send at 200 sat/byte = .000452

Good luck! Hope the mempool clears up so you can send your btc confidently knowing it will be confirmed. Keep an eye on [this website]( for mempool status.

I think you give Apple too much credit. There have been many fraudulent apps that have made it passed Apple's "screening process". I'm not positive about this one being a scam though. The items that come up from a search seem fairly legitimate. Is there a way to contact any support? If so, that's what I would recommend.

Anti-Trust lawsuit. Claims include Kraken developers, Bitmain / Wu, Bitcoin.com / Ver conspiring to exploit the Bitcoin ABC and SV fork of Bitcoin Cash, diversion of hashpower to ABC controlled pools, and the use of overt ASICboost for the pools under the control of Wu and Bitcoin.com. Not sure who UnitedCorp is, but from an outsider, they are likely to have a financial interest in the forked SV chain. I am not a lawyer, but the plaintiffs will need significant evidence to continue pursuit of the lawsuit, IMO

Having a fully updated and downloaded history of the bitcoin blockchain locally separates the Bitcoin Core wallet from other popular wallets that rely on third party trust to verify the bitcoin blockchain and your bitcoin transactions.

So as I understand, I must first send my bitcoin to a segwit wallet before the blockchain will even recognize the change in data structure of my transaction? Interesting. What will happen if the wallet I use becomes segwit ready? I assume that will enable me to send a segwit transaction inherently? I am skeptical yet excited, and I am eager to see how well this goes over. Also, the hashes of my transactions are unable to be modified by segwit nodes or is it any nodes? Can only segwit nodes receive a segwit transaction? So many questions. Literally no information in this "announcement". The mod who posted this should make an update with some actual guidance.

Can you explain how wallet providers opening LN channels will eliminate the concern of users being unable to afford opening their own channels? Maybe I don’t understand the logistics of those users opening their own channels..?

It's good you recognize the risk of keeping your bitcoin on exchanges. For desktop wallets, Electrum (if you don't have hardware to download entire blockchain), Armory (if you do)
Breadwallet or mycelium on mobile
And 9999... already said it, hardware wallets like trezor or ledger, keepkey, etc. I'd recommend using another option while you *get your feet wet* though

Coindesk released a story about it [today]( There's another linked article in there saying they were considering issuing a debt token like Bitfinex 
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:30:45
It really depends on how large your transaction size was in bytes compared to the fee you paid. There is a large backlog currently. There are many users experiencing the same issue. My guess would be your fee by satoshi/byte was in the 50 to 150 range.

I still don’t understand why these businesses that are dropping bitcoin as a payment option don’t just migrate to Coinbase Commerce from Merchant. I don’t get how moving from a custodial to a non-custodial service would be that damning. This just puts the business in charge of the account (read as: bitcoin address) rather than letting Coinbase receive the actual coins. Clearly they don’t see an advantage offering BTC as a payment / don’t have enough volume to justify the non-custodial management of BTC payments. Could this really be more about the quick exchange from BTC to cash? 
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:50:14
It sounds like the money you had on the Exchange wasn’t doing much as it was. It could be a great move; ultimately if you have the ability to lose 20k tomorrow, you might strategically consider it. Pretty high risk.

Absolutely looks like some kind of credit card scam. It looks like the domain was setup using a Great Britain domain registration site, Mesh Digital Limited. Additionally, the payment page says it’s operated by Monster Byte, Inc who is established in Panama City.

I’m not sure what that means exactly. Has copay integrated segwit addresses? My guess it’s something with how you were entering the receiving address or how you were trying to format your transaction.

To meet criteria set forth by the AICPA, you’d likely see internal and external vulnerability assessment controls in place to some effect including taking action to remediate critical and high risk vulnerablilities. This depends on the scope of the report, but Deloitte very well could have used procedure documents to provide reasonable assurance that these controls were in place since it’s a SOC 2 Type 1. It would be interesting to see the report.

It's likely just a lot of panic selling trying to get coins on exchanges to stop the loss in the event it continues to fall.

It would take a tremendous amount of time. It appears that only about 12 characters are exposed, so it would be quite impressive and lucky af if you were able to manage to do so. I'm not even sure where I would start. Do you know of a tool that would do something like that with it being known that you already had some of the private key?

I don’t think that is where you’d enter the cost basis. The line you’ve entered your cost basis (361.04) would be things such as selling fees, not what you originally purchased your bitcoin for (ie. exchange fees for selling). 
I recommend you get a tax professional if you continue to struggle. I am not a tax professional.

If you're speaking to the devastation of the hurricane, I would agree. I thought the video was more of a demonstration of how the banking system currently has no accountability to actually hold your funds for you while they are making it seem to the general public that they do. 
Owning bitcoin and holding the private keys allows you to access everything at any second of the day and gives you the power to be your own bank without allowing others to exploit your assets for their own benefit. Maybe I'm totally off target, but thanks for taking the time to comment.
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:51:03
haha that stuck out to me as well. What does that even mean? My first thought was that they were unable to send due to them not controlling a private key for the bitcoin. Any thoughts?
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:36:13
I'm not familiar with your wallet, but I don't think there is any reason to worry. It will eventually get confirmed. Does Jaxx have Replace by Fee (RBF) enabled? If so, you could try to send the transaction again with a higher fee if it is a high priority transaction.
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:49:03
This is a valid question. It appears that for the last 200+ blocks the segwit transaction % has [dropped]( from about 17% to just below 10%. My guess is that due to the significant rise in price over the past few weeks, it has brought many legacy coins onto the exchanges to cash in prior to a major correction. Who's to know?
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:47:04

This is bigger news than I’d like to admit if indeed true. There has been no public announcement I am aware of from Coinbase indicating their intention to discontinue their merchant platform and tools. This would impact bitcoin payment options for large businesses such as Overstock, Expedia, Microsoft and many more. I don’t understand why Coinbase would do such a thing as [Bloomberg was reporting on development of the Coinbase Merchant services as recently as Feb. 14, 2018]( 
Is it possible CheapAir is referring to another service Coinbase is providing for them? They state they are considering moving to BitPay, and to answer the blog posts question, BitPay’s exclusive support for BIP 70 is quite dumb. Coinbase fucking up Bitcoin adoption opportunity as usual. 
Edit: I did some more looking into this and found a [Medium post]( providing more detail on this situation. Seems that they are moving to offer a different service. I’m not sure what the differences between Coinbase Merchant &amp; their newer service Coinbase Commerce. I don’t get why that wouldn’t meet the needs of CheapAir, but truly interesting response from them.

That’s pretty unfortunate. So you’re saying BTCJam was actually using accounts on the site to take out loans with their lenders with the intention of never paying them back? 
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:14:36
I still think adoption and legitimate hype are contributing factors for the rise in value that we have seen over the past year and a half. Store of value is pretty much inherent with an asset that is deflationary in nature. People are just becoming privy to this and slowly understanding the many valuable traits of cryptocurrency whether that be security, psuedo-anonymity, medium of exchange, etc. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:02:49
Yeah, pretty concerning from a business perspective if I was using Coinbase to offer bitcoin payment options. Now that I think about it, was Reddit using Coinbase Merchant to accept bitcoin payments for reddit Gold? perhaps that was a contributing factor for disabling the payment option??? 
@_date: 2018-04-25 06:19:28
Definitely not good practice in a number of scenarios that I can think of this being used in.
@_date: 2018-04-22 07:25:51
I did some research on this, and it appears that they are still providing a similar service, [Coinbase Commerce]( that would still allow them to accept and convert BTC/USD. If you ask me, it sounds more like a rebranding of their service than a discontinuation of it. Unless there is something I’m missing here regarding the differences between the services, CheapAir could just migrate to Coinbase Commerce from Coinbase Merchant Tools.

This is kind of weird app behavior to change so quickly. It might make me think it’s been compromised and the attacker is attempting to get you to send coins to their address. In my experience using exchange addresses, a similar thing might happen if you are attempting to receive bitcoin, but it certainly would not change in the middle of generating a receive address.
 Did you report this to the developers of the application for explanation/clarification? 
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:22:22
Maybe think about how there are different ways to obtain bitcoin (P2P, centralized exhange, OTC, auction, etc) and how these forms exist within the current bitcoin ecosystem, how they have evolved over time, how sales are marketed...There should be plenty of metrics to go off of regarding volume charts, advantages and disadvantages of each sales form, etc. Also now that there are ways to get into Bitcoin futures..Hope that helps.

Yeah, im with you there. I’m more considering this a conservative move as the IRS has yet to provide a distinction whether the wash rule applies to BTC property. I would agree that there is an argument to be made (that it doesn’t apply) based on the current rule in place and their classification. Thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2018-12-14 05:03:17
The key distinction to make here is that you are unable to gain tax benefits from a capital gains loss if you purchase the BTC back within 30 days. I think this says that it is not clear this rule applies, but playing it conservatively, you would need to wait at least 31 days to re purchase to be able to claim the loss and reduce any tax liability.
