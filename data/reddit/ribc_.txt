For a general idea of the price, just simpy go to coinmarketcap.com, select your coin and then use the slider under the chart to select your timeframe.

What on earth are you talking about? What does corruption in the financial sector have to do with second layer scaling solutions? Your post feels like something from @_date: 2018-01-29 20:37:02
Feels bad, but it probably is not a very smart idea to buy a $3,000 piece of hardware without investigating the site/customer reviews ;) At least it is a good lesson. Remember, bitcoin transactions can not be reversed, you have to pay much more attention than when paying with paypal or credit card.
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:34:31
Do not ask about this on reddit. Read the bitcoin whitepaper, watch Andreas Antopoulos or Ivan on tech on youtube (first explains bitoin, second is a programmer and has a lot of educational videos) 
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:49:46
It is a short or long position beign traded on bitcoin. If you do not understand it, google "long and short positions"
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:39:35
Seems to me like you did not due proper due dilligence, or the people you communicated with are just slow. Either way, saying stocks are dead is clearly idiotic.

DO NOT trade unless you are a seasoned trader and have actuall knowledge about financial markets. 99.5% of people who trade cryptos get rekt daily and lose enormous amount. Maybe you think "damn, I knew the price was going down, I should have sold and bought in at a lower price" but that is based entirely on luck and not on any price analysis, and you will get obliterated this way in the long term. You will not make a million out of $100, neither by trading nor hodling, so just chill and forget about crypto for a couple years, if you want to invest more, do small sums over time (e.g. $50 every week) and DO NOT panic sell or panic buy.

You do not understand what a decentralized cryptocurrency means. If a cryptocurrency is decentralized, it means there is no central authority and noone can block or change any transactions. The fact that fiat gateways are centralised is unfortunate, but there are platforms like the 0x project which focus on developing a decentralized crypto exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:26:46
I actually have to laugh so hard at the so-called "ripple investors". These people have to be one of the dumbest species in crypto markets. You know why people buy xrp? Because they want to invest in cryptos because they unironically believe that it will multiply by 100-fold in two weeks, look at top 5 cryptos, and think "These are too expesive, I don't have 14k to buy a whole bitcoin or whatever these other are, I better buy this blue fidget spinner that is a couple of bucks without knowing shit about it, other that the big banks are using it to do something that is too complicated for me to understand"
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:50:46
Yes. In fact, it has no usecases as a cryptocurrency. The xrp token is centralised, therefore noone who want to pay for goods in a decentralized manner will not use it, paypal is in fact better to do these operations in acentralised manner. Banks do not use it either, they only use ripplenet with fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:48:35
I have a feeling a lot of people do not know what a "decentralized cryptocurrency" means. It is the freedom to transact, not the freedom to convert it to fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:21:49
This. Ripple is not a currency. Xrp is not a currency. Ripplenet is not a public system, it is a banking solution. Xrp tokeny have no usecases, ironically they are not even used by tha banks that are adopting ripple's technology, because they can just use fiat. Ripple did not even have to market anything towards the public, stupid investors bough xrp because of being a sub-dollar "cryptocurrency", not because of fundamentals, usecases and decentralization, the foundation of all cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:14:51
Bitcoin will be always one of the most value crypto assets thnaks to the wide development community. The lightning network is currently on a testnet, which is a couple months from actual mainnet deployment. If you are scared that bitcoin will fail bacause of high fees, then transfer into ethereum or litecoin. Bitcoin does not fail when it has high fees. High fees arise from high adoption rate. So if bitcoin wouldn't be the new hot thing and wouldn't have risen multiple thousands of % over the past severeal years, there would be no high fees. But then you wouln't make anywhere near as much from hodling as you do now. Fees are a tradeof to making insane returts on investment in this technology and currency.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:57:44
That is what I was trying to say, yes of course the companies had assests, buldings, people on payrolls, but they were underperforming and they were rewarded for it. From what I have read, they were basically unable to sustain their operations, making huge multi-million losses each year, and so the investors jumped the ship.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:07:49
I don't have to tax my trading profits, and neither have you. Just do not convert it to fiat, and it is not taxable for the time beign (some exchange may snitch you out to the irs for your crypto-to-crypto trades which could be *theoretically* taxed, but otherwise it is impossible for the irs to know about it.)
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:07:12
No lol. This is the biggest misconception in the crypto space today. XRP is NOT being used by the banks testing ripple net. Think about it. There is this great network develeloped by ripple to replace swift system for international transactions between banks (b2b) and then there is this xrp token, which is centralised and controlled by the company, is highly volatile, has no actual usecase, AND IS NOT MANDATORY TO BE ABLE TO USE RIPPLENET. So why would any bank, even after they adopt ripple as a means of bank-to-bank monetary exchange, use this token instead of fiat currency? absolutely zero.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:41:46
What sets it apart is that it was the first cryptocurrency to be implemented succesfully and was functional as a medium of exchange. Litecoin is one of the best transaction cryptocurrency, and bitcoin is currently better for storing value.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:49:18
They said it is a bubble. Bitcoin is in bubble. Bitcoin was in a bubble multiple times. It always bursted. It always came to new all-time highs. You are the average Joe if you say that bitcoin or any other crypto is or ways not at some point a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:51:53
What do you mean regain dominance? It has still the largest market cap out of any cryptocurrency out there.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:37:19
And just to be clear, the swift network is already fast. The only problem is currency conversion and reserves that each bank has to have at their disposal to perform these transactions. Imagine if you are bank a, buy ripple and send that ripple to bank b, which then has to sell it for fiat to actually have something that is a legal currency. That is counterproductive for them, so they just won't use xrp at all. And btw, there are companies like R3, which is a startup competing with ripple, that offers private blockchain solutions (so there is no public token, which is great for the banks, as they do not want to use it anyways) and they are better for banks because there is no consensus nonsense and can be directly taylored to any Financial institutuion's needs. Ripple is a experiment. A totally unjustifiable mixture of a cryptocurrency with a banking system. Tbh, without xrp, the ripple system is decent and will probably get adopted by some major financial institutions, but as soon as every idiot who buys their useless token finds out that the monetyry value is purely speculative and that the only usecase is to fund ripple corporation, the price will plumment to near-zero value, as it has no fundamental usecases as a cryptocurrency. Sorry for the ranty style of the commnets, but I spent a lot of time researching ripple's technology myself and am really frustrated noone points these things out, just Screams "buy ripple, banks are using it, you will get rich quick" ;-;

It makes me triggered when these so-called "investors" who made 0 due dilligence and made 2x this month by just holding the coin think that they are blockchain experts. The whitepaper has laid foundation for modern cryptocurrencies as we know it, but that does not mean shit for current technological development. Its same with BCH and BTC supporters, both groups use the whitepaper as their argument for completely baseless discussions. smh
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:03:07
How is this useful? Noone cares what Satoshi Nakamoto said 9 years ago, we are nearly in 2018 and need to adress the current problems with current options. I hate this "But papa Satoshi said.." argument. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:19:41
Couldn't believe it either. They even said they would seek partnerships with companies involved with blockchain technology, while their sole product is ice tea. I don't see it as a indicator that we are entering the "internet bubble" era now, and that every company with blockchain in their name will rise 10fold in market cap. But you will probably see articles such as "Sell right now, bubble is about to pop" which isn't really helping the mainstream view on crypto really.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:47:43
That is false. Many businesses are accepting bitcoin. As a matter of fact, how do you pay for bitcoin transactions? Oh right, with bitcoin. so even if noone outside of miners would value bitcoin, they would still accept is as a payment for the computational pover they provide, therefore giving it monetary value.

You can get it on Amazon for $18 if you are so spooked :-) 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:54:53
Thanks for the explanation, I never really understood the investment universe. The thing is, as you said, that it is a completely new field but my thinking is: Even if this is a "bubble", so what, it has popped so many times and recovered so quickly and made new all-time highs, after Mtgox, after the segwit2x disaster and bcash pump, and I dont know what else there could be that would be worse than these incidents, if noone hacks any major exchange or exploits the blockchain in some way, but perhaps there is always a possibility things could go worse indefinetelly.
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:50:41
That is complete bullshit. Buying $100 of bitcoin will potentially give you the same ROI % as buying $1,000,000 of bitcoin. Stop spreading misinformation, it is not true that because of lower price, the coin will rise more, it depends entirely on market cap and circulating supply. Ripple is one third of bitcoin's market cap, but it has 40 Billion circulating supply, and the price is around three dollars. Please learn the basics of valutaing cryptocurrencies and stop giving this terrible advice.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:38:31
Oh boy. It may never regain a 50% dominance, but why are you so fixated on this? In my view, bitcoin has many problems now, that hopefully off-chain solutions like LN will solve. Until then, people look to invest in alts. Most chose apparently xrp, which is the only top 10 cryptocurrency which is not actually a true cryptocurrency, being heavily centralised and hving no usecase.

If you falsely request a refund on PayPal after receiving a digital item, the retailer will lose his money. Bitcoin needs a better UI so an average user never sees addresses, only accepts or denies payments. Besides that, PayPal is slow and expensive and now requires full kyc from everyone. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:12:53
Because it is cheaper, safer, faster, more reliable, decentralized and uncensorable? It is like asking why would anyone make a transaction through PayPal instead of a credit card. Well, maybe I do not want to use my fucking credit card because I do not want to be involved in wire fraud or identity theft.
@_date: 2018-06-14 10:16:53
Unquestionably after completing a continuation pattern that is bearish? Please, think before you speak. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 10:15:59
It is looking very bad right now, we completed a multi-month continuation pattern, and the target is around $1500. It is unlikely it will reach that level though. This market is irrational, so it is likely that the prices will just bottom out of nowhere and reverse into an uptrend. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:01:38
How can someone be so illiterate to think that the volatility of a new asset class is a way to measure it's usability as a store of value in the future? As adoption and liquidity along with more advanced financial products like ETFs develop, volatility will decrease rapidly. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 11:52:17
That depends on the fee market. If lightning is implemented successfully, the fees will be insignificant. And even if the fees were to rise along the price, they would be nowhere near the level which we have seen in December 2017.
@_date: 2018-06-14 10:43:21
You are wrong. It is not centralized. In fact, it is more decentralized than bitcoin itself, as the channels are pure p2p connections that do not require centralized miners for every transaction. You should learn about the technology before spreading misinformation. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:55:39
Look over at r/ledgerwallet, people are reporting failing transactions on segwit and legacy. It probably is a bug within their chrome app or the app-ledger interface. Seems like they are aware of the issue, but can't tell you when it will get fixed. You will have to hodl for the moment :/
@_date: 2018-03-10 14:39:30
wrong sub.
@_date: 2018-07-31 22:33:44
Bitcoin is nothing like torrent, the only thing it has in common is that both are P2P networks, but torrent uses that for file transmssion, whereas bitcoin uses it for node syncing. Bitcoin, on the main level, is a decentralized timestamping server.
