Maybe that's why they wait a while. No transactions for a couple weeks? Time to withdraw.

All I'm saying is you don't compulsively check the price (which is what this thread is about) because it's a cool new technology, you do it because you have money on the line.

I hate to be a downer, but adults rarely listen to kids. I could totally imagine a scenario where kid tells new carer 
"dad said that's really important",

Age doesn't really matter and yes. But everyone here will prob say yes.
I just buy a little every payday, nothing I'll miss. Less like investing and more like a retirement fund.

Gambling is not new, the game is irrelevant.
