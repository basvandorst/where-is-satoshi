Why do people keep perpetuating this lie?
The mining operation can be located anywhere at all.  The bandwidth required for miners would remain unchanged.  It's just the node operators and pool operators that need fast connections.  I don't think it's that unreasonable.
Nodes and pool operations should probably be hosted in datacenters anyway.  The barrier to entry to rent a virtual server is low and getting lower.
@_date: 2015-06-21 04:51:36
Sure you can, you just place the node in the cloud and point the mining operation at it.
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:36:47
Further, when mining you don't actually need to download the entire block.  Only the mining dispatcher (pool operator) needs to have the block.  They can just host that on a virtual server somewhere and then connect the mining farm to that server.  No additional bandwidth needed (except at the VM's datacenter, but that's what they are for).

The current plan is a hack-job that bolts things onto the side of the blockchain.  Why would anyone want to use SegWit over the main bitcoin chain?  A SegWit transaction is a lesser transaction that cannot be read by all nodes (unupgraded nodes).  Implementing it as a soft fork is a poor compromise.  Go big or go home.  A segWit transaction is harder to spend than a normal transaction (unlike a normal transaction, not everyone can receive one), so it has less value.  
The vision of some of the core devs is at odds with the wishes of the community at large.  That is a situation that cannot end well.

@_date: 2016-01-11 19:48:43
So, am I incorrect in the following?:
If I can't handle the added resources required to implement segwit, (it's a soft fork, so I can choose to ignore the segwit data), and choose not to update to segwit, I cannot recieve segwit transactions, correct?  Further, I cannot recieve any transactions that were run through segwit at any time in the coin's history.
This essentially splits bitcoin into two categories.  Will coins that are tied up on the segwit chain be valued at a lower value than 'pure' coins (as the segwit coins have lower utility)?  How would having two exchange rates affect the bitcoin ecosystem?
@_date: 2016-01-11 21:49:41
I really do appreciate the time you are taking to answer my concerns.  I spend way, way too much time looking at bitcoin stuff, and have a technical background, but even so, it is impossible to stay current on everything despite trying to.
The advantages you list sound pretty good.  I clearly have some more research to do.
I still don't understand why a user would want his/her transaction as a segwit transaction over a standard transaction though.  If I'm going to send you bitcoin, I want to make sure you get it.  I would have two choices:  Send the transaction on the main chain, or send it using segwit.
If I send it with segwit, I can save a few cents in transaction fees, but if you aren't running segwit, you can't spend the money without upgrading.  So, as the sender, I just pay a fraction more in transaction fees and include the entire transaction on the main chain so I can ensure that you receive your money.
It seems to me that if segwit is great and should be implemented (and you have done a great job convincing me of that) wouldn't it be much cleaner done as a hard fork?  That way you have everyone playing by the same rules and can maintain full interoperability.  
When I said 'hack-job' earlier, I was referring specifically to the soft fork implementation.  It seems like a dirty way to do it.  Easier, though.

It would be easy to censor a few nodes, but that would accomplish nothing.  You would have to censor ALL nodes (or more specifically, all the mining nodes).
It would also a lot harder to ddos a data center grade node than a home DSL grade node.
If Apple runs a node, and Microsoft runs a node and the Bank of England runs a node and so on... that is still decentralized.
You are absolutely correct when you say that bitcoin will fail before it gets to that stage though.  If nothing is done about the current situation, bitcoin will be dead by year's end.

But, let's assume you are correct.  Let's say every full node is hosted only by large banks.  There are no private nodes.  How, exactly would they censor my transaction?
@_date: 2016-01-11 20:58:52
Fair enough.
So, it seems to me that segwit transaction is less valuable than a non-segwit transaction (because unlike a normal transaction, it's not guaranteed that the recipient can actually spend it).  If the entire point of keeping the blocksize small is to reduce required resources, but if you actually want to be able to spend any money you recieve (both normal, and segwit transactions) you need to run segwit and incur the additional overhead, thus defeating the advantage of having the small blocks.
And that's not even a permenant solution...  it might kick the ball farward a few months (It seems to me that there isn't much incentive for a user to use segwit over the main chain, so I suspect most transactions will continue to be the normal style), and then the blocks will be full again and we are back at square one.
The way I see it, segwit doesn't really solve anything, but rather delays a problem while adding complexity.  Further it spits the ecosystem into two groups, and may even split the price of a bitcoin into two groups.

Your second link is a personal attack followed by a problem that has very likely been fixed.  All code has bugs.  Core code has bugs too.  Just because a bug existed doesn't mean the basic idea was flawed.
Coding for Flexible Transactions is supposedly almost complete.  I don't see any repository on github though.  In any case, the specification is clearly defined and doesn't have any gaping holes to solve.
Lightning, on the other hand (I know Lightning and FT address different problems) -- which is supposed to save us all -- does have a gaping hole.  The routing problem has yet to be solved properly.
[As a side note, I think Lightning is great.  We need something like that to truly scale.  I hope a solution is found soon]

TIL bitcoin is an altcoin.
BIP-66 caused a split where older nodes rejected blocks mined by new nodes causing a split in the chain.
In reality, a hard fork is a bitcoin protocol upgrade.  It's clearly defined in the whitepaper.
@_date: 2017-03-13 22:24:58
1) I'm not making words up here.  Majority is a common word, and it's definition can be found in a dictionary.  It is defined as 'More than half'.
2) Oh, but that would be a hard fork.  And that chain would have less work than a non-difficulty adjusted chain of the same length and much easier to attack. (and would therefore hold less value)
@_date: 2016-01-07 17:08:38
What's the problem with nodes being run on cloud services?  I see that as a good and natural evolution of bitcoin.  A node on a cloud service will offer far higher availability and far better bandwidth than a user running a node on their home internet connection.
As long as all nodes aren't running on the SAME cloud service, this is a good thing.  It's the closest thing you can get to enterprise-grade without leasing physical space in a datacenter.
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:10:02
Oh, young grasshopper...  You have much to learn.
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:50:10
1) a)None. It's completely market driven.  Eventually a large block will be mined.  Miners will either build upon it or not.  It's generally assumed that miners will wait until a majority hashrate is signaling acceptance, but there is nothing preventing someone from mining a big block right now (except game theory).
2) If a fork occurred where a majority of hashrate moves to the fork, rendering the minority chain so unusable that they need to somehow push out an emergency hard-fork to adjust difficulty, I think that would be a successful fork.
What do you think the odds that the minority chain would be able to pull off a successful hardfork of their own.  Remember, in this scenario, the minority chain would be the group that is against hard-forks at all cost (this is why we have segwit).
Even if they pulled it off, what do you think the price of this coin would be like?
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:13:59
That blog post is riddled with fallacies and additionally provides no evidence to back up any of the claims.
It's 'worst case scenario' is that if blocks grew hugely that it would require 'a small data center' to run a node.
Think about that.  If it takes a small datacenter to run a node, that means that MASSIVE amount of transactions are taking place.  In order to generate that level of data, most of the world would be using bitcoin daily.  If that was true, the price of a single bitcoin would be unbelievable - and you could use the bitcoin that you are holding now to buy your own data center.
If Bitcoin nodes have to be hosted in datacenters, how is that bad for Bitcoin?  Satoshi himself even said that was a likely outcome.

Perhaps, but there are far simpler, more elegant, and more secure options.
For example, fixing transaction malleability using a hard fork could fix malleability for all cases, not just for special transactions.  It could be implemented in a way that doesn't leave funds available to be stolen with a 51% attack.
Big Blockers are not against 2nd layer solutions.

Segwit on it's own is not a solution.  Even the fabled 'Lightning Network' (which will solve all our problems) will not work without space in blocks to open/close channels.
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:47:06
1) When a majority of miners signal support and raise their Excessive Block size, then a fork will happen.
2) ETH is still a poor example to use because of its dynamic difficulty adjustment.  Bitcoin punishes the minority chain much, much more.  This argument keeps popping up over and over and over and shows a fundamental misunderstanding of differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:15:07
Then update the list!
YOU can make a difference here :)
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:16:37
You are correct, the malleability is a small problem and if you wanted non-malleable transactions, then you would create that type.
Long term, a hard fork is actually safer.  It's a cleaner implementation and would ensure greater consistency in transactions.  This UASF that has recently started being taked about is FAR more dangerous than a hard fork.
As for the 51% attack:  Because segwit is implemented as a soft fork, it must be backward compatible with current clients.  With segwit, signature data is moved to the segwit portion of the blocks.  However, unupgraded nodes cannot see that signature data.  
Segwit uses a basic transaction on the main chain that is more or less unsecured on it's own.  Segwit enabled clients will recognise that as a segwit transaction, and know that it's not actually an unsecured transaction, but that they need to look to the segwit portion of the block to validate the signature.  Non-segwit enabled nodes don't even know the extra segwit data exists, so to them it just looks like an unsecured transaction.
This is why segwit needs such a high activation threshold.  It is critical that miners are segwit aware so that the signatures for segwit transactions are validated.  If miners are not checking and rejecting segwit transactions where the signature is unvalid, then funds held in segwit transactions can be stolen by anyone.  Those blocks would be rejected by segwit nodes, but allowed by non-segwit nodes, causing a chain split.
If the number of segwit enabled coins becomes large, there is a large amount of coins that could be taken if miners choose to collude, stop supporting segwit, and steal them.
This is a new attack vector that does not exist in Bitcoin today.  This is a major reason why people feel that segwit in it's current form is not the best way to scale bitcoin.  We can scale without introducing additional vulnerabilities at teh protocol level.

Hell, no.  It's much better to just wait and see, and I think that is what is happening.  People are taking a wait and see approach to see if Bitcoin can actually get beyond this capacity limitation.

Admittedly, finding evidence is difficult because companies don't usually report on ideas that they reject, but I found this:
“There are giant companies that want to add Bitcoin, large banks, large companies, large websites, with millions of users – they have rejected adding Bitcoin because it doesn’t scale”
I work with conventional payment solutions for a living.  I run a system that processes ~50,000 transactions per day using Visa, Mastercard, Debit, and proprietary cards.  I could not in good conscience recommend bitcoin because of scaling issues.  
There is no way I could recommend spending ~$80,000+ (the cost to implement a new payment method) on bitcoin acceptance.  The userbase is too small to get enough transactions to make back the $80,000.  The userbase will have difficulty growing if there is no capacity for these new users to use.  Thus, without proper scaling, the bitcoin userbase will remain stagnent.  Without a large enough userbase, the business case for implementing bitcoin acceptance won't make sense.
That's my argument.  I look forward to your thoughtful rebuttal.

I never said 100 mbps was common (although it's not that uncommon anymore).
Australia is known for having shit internet. Anyways, any of the listed plans would have no problem keeping up with 2mb block sizes.

Oh, are we allowed to quote Satoshi here again?

The first line of the link you provided says that the site doesn't take into account thing like compact blocks.
We've come full circle.

Google is your friend, but basically it uses a bloom filters to relay block information so that the entire block does not need to be transferred.  Only transactions missing from the nodes' mempool need to be transferred.

I don't know.  BU does or did.  Core implemented basically the same thing as compactblocks though, so... core uses it.

Anecdotes are not data.
Just because you have a shit internet connection, does not mean the rest of the world hasn't improved.
My home internet upload is 5x faster than 10 years ago, and I haven't upgraded my package.

But 2X is exactly the same as what you have now, expect with twice the capacity.
On chain transactions are extremely resistant to censorshp.  That is literally the idea behind Bitcoin.  Moving those transactions offchan will increase the risk of transaction censrship.
2X increases the amount of space for onchain transactions, reducing the ability to restrict unwanted transactions.

You know what they call it when things never change?

But, but the bitcoin.com wallet was created by the EVIL Roger Ver.
Just wait for Bitcoin Core to release something.

It's been solved with thinblocks.

I wouldn't give the Conservatives the steam off my piss.

I don't know about making money, but if anyone wants to know how to lose money with Bitcoin, just ask!  I'm a pro.

They cannot lie.
This is a vote.  Either the flag is set or it is not.
@_date: 2016-10-28 04:43:33
Thank god this problem has been permanently solved!

... and we couldn't afford boots so mom used to wrap our feet in barbed wire for extra traction to get up those hills!

I know you are probably freaking out, but even like a year ago when I would request a CAD withdrawal, it would take like a week to process.  I don't think it's Virtex's fault, but rather that is how long the banks take.  
Just be patient young grasshopper.  If you don't have your money by next Friday, then start freaking out.

Hmm... I wonder if BitPay monitors the mempool and if it grows beyond a certain size, then you have to wait for your transaction to be confirmed before you get your credit...
@_date: 2016-07-15 03:20:24
Interesting.  Thanks for the research!!
@_date: 2016-07-13 15:18:35
Interesting...  I also bought a game from Steam last night using Bitcoin, but my transaction was accepted with 0 conf.  I didn't have to wait 'for settlement'.
