if we add the other 33K coins still unmoved, non BTC assets would just be worth 87K BTC or $52M.
Open USD swaps was around $38M with USD offers above greater than $6M.  
$38M + $6M = $44M known USD holdings.
$52M - $44M = $8M woth of ETC/ETH/LTC/some unknown number of BTCs?
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:59:36
I'll try to clean this up with my limited skills.
120K stolen funds represent 36.4% of the total assets of BFX. That means they still have around 210K BTC worth of coins/fiat.  
120K(36%) + 210K(64%) = 330K (100% before the hack)
After confirming they owned this [address]( , we'll deduct 90K(current as of writing) BTC from the 210K BTC(or ) worth of assets left.
210K - 90K = 120K BTC(or $72.5M) worth of USD/ETH/LTC/unaccounted BTC
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:55:34
And that's the beauty of this entire public blockchain project. 
We know their crypto cold wallets and some approximation of their fiat liabilities. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 22:18:25
My calculation 
Very close results. Something's wrong with BFX's calculation.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:07:30
Same calculations. Care to explain? @_date: 2016-08-07 21:27:34
it's 90k now.
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:11:09
Definitely. Open the books.
Currently the address has around 90K BTC + Another 33K from 39coweGgC8CPZ6hYL1BBEfc1zqbSfHsprW
The hack amounts to 49% or even less of their BTC holdings.

As far as i know, they're not buying BTC to cover lost coins. They'll just be giving them the USD equivalent of those. I could be wrong though.

@_date: 2016-08-08 12:15:50
Do you understand how margin trading works in BFX right? You cannot withdraw margin bought BTC or if you're a lender, USD.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:21:42
This raises some questions and speculations. 
Could they have users with preferential treatment? 
Are they not contributing? 
Are they undervaluing non-BTC assets?

New, professional management might change the opinion of those who wants to leave bfx.
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:35:32
SO. Someone else lent you those USD. You can't just margin buy without someone else lending you USD.


And this trade would reflect on the  total open USD Swaps.

No, It's mainly used for sending money to their families back home. In most developing countries, they have to support extended families(their parents, in laws, and sometimes even their grandparents).
edit: "Home" is far away from the cities they work in.
Mpesa's graduated fee structure says that sending Ksh1000/US$11 to someone anywhere in Kenya, you'll only be charged 5.5%.
Sending US$200/Ksh17,000, you'll only pay a fee of around **1.3%**

Bitcoin or something like it, is going to change the world. even if you don't understand/agree with it.

Governments could be afraid rival states will use bitcoin to fund spy operations. Not that democratic countries like China and Russia will be the first to pass laws making it illegal.

Bitcoinity is adding volumes of the currency pairs they have, which misleading. I think ANX is just convering your prefered currency to dollars? ANX's traded volume should be 1/10 of the number listed on bitcoinity.
compare the trade volumes between these pairs:
Just the same right? someone should ask the owner of bitcoinity to correct it.

maybe you were not into bitcoins when this happened.

Years ago, people were saying the same things about bitcoin.
as long as people see value in it, why not?
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:58:47


i never said it would be decentralized. government cryptos would be centralized.


i'm not talking about bitcoin, but the technology behind it.

i think the average joe doesn't really think alot about government control over their money as long as it is stable.
Bitcoin would always be an alternative to gov. backed ones.
