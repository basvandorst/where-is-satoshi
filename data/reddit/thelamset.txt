Current global consumption levels are unsustainable, so some limits or disincentives (like deflation) would not be a bad thing. WWF Living Planet 2012 report gives a rough estimate that the resource utilization in eg. Qatar, Kuwait and also US for example are 12x, 10x achievements, and 5x larger than what the Earth sustainably outputs. Whether you agree with their metrics more or less, the scientific consensus is that in many areas (water, carbon, soil) we overconsume without a good transition plan. And on the other hand, life satisfaction and happiness improves only slightly with exponentially growing individual wealth, fireworks, mansions and gold watches. It improves greatly with better environment, relationships and community.
Bank lending at its core is about creating value to return more value, not just spend it and eat it. The issues are as much financial and political as social and cultural. I for one think that having unregulated free markets would not improve the situation at all.

Or for another altcoin idea, all coin outputs could have a yearly expiration date. All blockchain entries older than a year could be removed, and unspent, forgotten coins would be cleaned up.
@_date: 2014-03-12 08:48:39
Much lighter blockchain, especially the shorter the turnaround period is set. This would maybe, optionally, allow for heavier and faster blocks.
@_date: 2014-01-17 15:03:59
Care to say just a bit more on why is that?
@_date: 2014-03-12 11:40:10
I agree that for many heavy blockchain is and will not a problem. But in developing world, in future, for some, it might. It limits the potential of the network. 
Other advantage of coin expiration would be obviously transparency as to how many coins are truly lost and how many are held. This question presents a very important risk factor for the markets, like in the concept of early adopters, ponzi scheme comparisons etc.

You assume proof of work is less energy efficient than the infrastructure behind other money transmitting systems. Actually it's not that obvious.

Faucets and lotteries are a terrible idea. They reward repetitive, automatic work, and irrational behavior. If I were to give away a lot of Bitcoin, I'd give them to a socially responsible institution, with tens of millions it could be UNICEF or Red Cross, as a financial security, under condition that they can't touch it for five years. During that time it would just passively improve their books and credit rating.

That's assuming he would want to cash out at all, but why would he? Anyway, keeping it quiet would be best, but Satoshi's speculated addresses are watched now with high attention. Any activity there would immediately give away that someone in control is back and the entire stack of 980K is no longer frozen. Still, I have no idea about his intentions, and in what way it would play out on the markets and in the media.

To be clear, I agree that 1939-1989 was in most ways a setback and about the homo sovieticus mentality. I agree even though to me the "spirit of the nation" metaphor (that was only conceived late in the 19th century by Hegel) and nationalism in general is not the best picture of how societies work. I prefer the more borderless idea of citizenry.

[It's described in detail on Bitcoin wiki]( Like the article said, the system is pseudonymous. So to simplify, it's like a masquerade - everything that goes on is perfectly public, the only unknown is how a persona ties to a real world identity - until an actor reveals himself. And he has to, when he wants to somehow receive fiat money for Bitcoins in real world. As the article said too, there are countermeasures that allow to obscure the picture, but they all have serious potential weaknesses.
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:39:35
Fair point, I actually tried to find something for my previous comment, but there is no proof available -- because the chips are proprietary, and we can't be 100% sure what's inside. However, consensus is that the economy of ASIC technology is such that any extra circuits above what's absolutely neccessary drive the cost out of any competitive range. Especially introducing any memory or more complex logical circuits, which would be needed for any sensible alternative use.
To achieve best performance they should be specific to the Bitcoin proof-of-work, not normal hashing. Maybe some ASICs could be used to brute force crack single SHA-256, but to my knowledge and googling no vendor announced such (perhaps desirable) feature yet.
Here, to illustrate the consensus, I googled a couple discussions of this: [1]( [2]( [3]( [4](

That is a neoliberal/libertarian perspective, that became somewhat popular in Poland after successful Balcerowicz's policies during the capitalist transformation. Let me list some obvious counterarguments. The Scandinavian countries that top all kind of developmental and/or life satisfaction rankings are heavily statist and have extensive welfare and high taxes. The post-Great Crisis and post-WW2 growth went together with enormous state interventions and "socialist" policies, such as the Marshall Plan, Medicare program and GI Bill, and decades of stable development followed in the Western world until a conservative/militarist backlash came around the time of Reagan/Thatcher. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:47:34
To me it seems way too rhetorical where you compare USA to WWII-era dictatorships, say that French healthcare succeeded because of governmental violence, and state that free market is perfectly efficient.
I recognize there is a grain of truth in what you are saying, e.g. valid problems with militarization of police, subsidies for public healthcare, and private enterpreneurship struggles with bureaucracy and taxes. Doesn't change the big picture for me, where governments are better at providing a lot of public services while caring about externalities.

There is no guarantee that a mixer won't run away with your money.
IANAE, but from what I understand, technically there are no identifiable "coins". There is only a chain of transactions that may have any numeric values of "inputs" and "outputs".

First of all, these are the richest wallets, not owners. Many of them are supposedly owned by large exchanges, like MtGox. That one study stated that Satoshi probably has 1M BTC, distributed among many wallets. Secondly, with fiat money the wealth disparity is harsh as well. 
[From Wikipedia]( "In 2007 the richest 1% of the American population owned 34.6% of the country's total wealth, and the next 19% owned 50.5%. The top 20% of Americans owned 85% of the country's wealth and the bottom 80% of the population owned 15%."

Real world economy aside. The crux of the algorithmic part is that mining's purpose is to secure the network. The coin generation part is just an incentive to get things started.
