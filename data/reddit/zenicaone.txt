government just telling (as in advising, suggesting...) you what to do is OK, government ordering you what to do and threatening violence if you do not do as told is problem.
regarding your finances of course - things that can hurt only you if you are wrong, and similar things.
some laws must exist though - to prevent fraud, murders, rapes etc basically government has right to enforce laws to stop you from hurting others.
What you do with your money is your business though. Anyone can tell you his opinion or advice on what you should do with your money but in the end its your decision. Nobody should hold a gun over your head and order you what to do with your money.

to anyone slightly normal reading this:
Your device is Truly Off only when you physically unplug it from the power socket. Everything else is Fake Off.

so its "technically off" but not "really off"
The only true off is when you unplug device - any device.

exactly what they hope for. Just take your money out of that bank and find a bank (or something else) that will allow you to do with your money what you want. Or keep money in 2 or three banks.

because there will be two or three instead of 100+ like now (did not google to see the correct number because its irrelevant)


thats artificial stimulation and is subject to corruption. 


People will have to be more invested into watching whats happening in the economy and will not allow gambling with their money as they do now. 
We are talking about revamping of the whole system and the way people think about economy, business, trading etc - while you are painting it as if everything will stay the same just currencies will not be in control of nation states. 


exactly why people (in general) do not pay much attention what is going on - because in the back of their heads they allways have (nah there in always insurance and bailout and safety mechanisms) -while big banks gamble with money recklessly because they too know that they are "too big to fail" and that government will supply them with free money if things go wrong (as from time to time they do)


thats worst worst case scenario - I can paint better picture but its pointless - both scenarios can happen - but the point is we dont know for sure what will happen.
sure firms who continue to do business as usual as if nothing changed will eventually go down - but most of the firms will recognize that things are different and will adapt to new situation and will start doing business more carefully. 
They will be waiting for big fish to make the wrong move and die (no bailout) to jump into its place with new way of thinking.
All this from my side and your side is of course pure speculation - nobody knows for sure how things will be developing - we can only try to give our best guesses based on some parameters.
But you are thinking about it wrong IMO - everything else stays the same while we have this change from gov-backed currencies to free floating independent currencies - No everything else will change and adapt to new situation or die out.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:13:10
there is no advantage or disadvantage. 
I assume that there will be several competing currencies for some time and that public will decide if they will in the end adopt and use only one that proved to be the best one, or only two almost equally good with minor differences and interchangeable. 
Or they will use hundreds of different currencies.
As long as you can move it freely , its OK.
point is public will decide what they want (over time)

if I provide service like hosting - I must host any site as long as its legal (by law), that pays me for that service.
Paypal provides service not content on their site - Infowars did not have their content on Paypals site.
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:22:29
the problem here is that we (most people) are reliant on services of private corporations for doing business - and they can decide to cut you off based on any BS excuse they can come up (their own rules) - and destroy your livelihood.
If paypal did this based on some government investigation or based on some court procedure and order where you get to defend yourself in front of the judge - that would be a whole another story.
wikileaks and infowars are just a precedent to establish normality of these things happening - it will not stop here.
now they can censor any media they dont like based on this precedent and any BS excuse they can come up.

you always need something for transaction. you need electricity/battery and internet.
if you want to buy sell gold you go to places where they buy/sell gold and have everything needed for transaction.
although we compare 2 different things. people do not use gold (as they used to back in the day) for everyday transactions, but as investment for long term plans. historically most stable holder of value - of course nothing is 100% and who knows what future carries - but its relatively safe long term bet.

democracy in capitalism simply does not work. does not exist. 
so you cant really say that nothing is better than something that does not exist.
free market? how free it is when we are at point where every corner of the market is almost or fully monopolized. 
every competition that tries to shake up market is emidiatly overtaken or destroyed if owner tries to resist for a while.


why its not an option?
as someone who champions free market - you are thinking in very narrow terms. capitalism or nothing else.
free market of ideas (?) some totaly new system built from scratch and not as a temporary patch for capitalism (?)
capitalism obviously does not work for people. 
do you need to wait until 0.000000000000000001% percent of population owns 99,99999999999% of wealth and profit to figure that out (?)

So if you made it to some point in your life where you are making a good money ... better make sure to post only pictures of your breakfast and sunset pictures on social media.
Talk only about vain and irrelevant things. sports, movies, tv shows are also risky topics, better stay away from those too.
Do not talk about politics at all. Why risk it.

as soon as you invent something new/revolutionary and lift it off the ground - you start thinking differently 
*How do I join this conglomerate of big private companies to my personal/individual advantage. How do I destroy competition.* 
and similar - because capitalism encourages individuality - you start thinking that you are way better than other people and that you deserve special place in society - with like minded people who were already there before you.
and now you have money to make that happen and to control things in society.

@_date: 2018-11-24 11:44:07


call me when its replaced. 
also bitcoin is closer to socialism than to capitalism if you are comparing it to whole systems.


why does it have to be pure communism as comparison. there are plenty systems out there and variations of systems - also we may think about building a new system all together that has never been tried before
For someone priding himself in thinking freely and celebrating free markets - you are thinking very narrowly about political systems.
capitalism or communism and thats it. 


as opposed where to capitalism where innovation is to the benefit of individual and not to the benefit of people - just as it should be (?)
*OH look I invented something new. how do I make people pay good money for it to get myself rich from my invention.* 
Just one example out of many:
*OH look, a plant can cure that sickness that I am making so much money on, by providing expensive painkillers for sick people. How do I make that plant illegal. Lets see if bribing these politicians will work. Yup it works*


you dont see capitalism heading in same direction? rich people getting richer while majority of population is getting more poor (?)
It used to be 1 men working (blue collar) , housewife and two to three children, house and two cars, vacation every year ... - living nice from one paycheck.
Try that now?


remains to be seen - but its irrelevant as I am not advocating for Chinese system anyway.
I am just arguing that your "capitalism or nothing else" way of thinking is wrong.
We must think about every system out there or invent a new one all together - because capitalism obviously does not work for people.


yup unlike in China where you have one Party holding monopoly on governance - in US you have whole two Parties to choose from - and checks and balances by totally not corrupt and not bribed people and institutions.
*OH look something is fishy over there. Lets send these guys to investigate.* 
They go there on their bicycles and come back in their Lamborghini.
*We investigated and everything is fine, no law breaking by this big corporation. There was this small thing though, but we made them pay $100.000 fine, so that will teach them.*


talking about free markets ... while saying that there is no alternative for free markets (or anything for that matter) ... dont you see the irony (?)


he lived in 19^th century - nothing generally changed since than and nothing will ever change (?)
We ended rethinking and innovating about political systems in 19^th century. We came to conclusion that will last till the end of times (?)
No new system will ever emerge (?)

its up to your own philosophy - what is really your goal.
why are you "in the game" for
rational investors are those who do not risk but they also perform at around 2% of growth a year - which is if you ask investors pretty "meh"
on the other hand - some investors like the risk.
as long as you "play" with the amounts of money that you can afford to never see again - in case something goes wrong - its all fine - you tried to make something big, you failed, life goes on.
and there are "investors" who like to go all in on high risk stocks ...
one of those sometimes gets lucky and gets very rich over night (so to say) ... but vast majority of them end up under the bridge  (so to say, again) 
my advice - dont be  "investors" - play with as much money as you can afford to lose and say "heh at least I tried"
