I think the easiest way to securely generate a private key is using a coin and a brainwallet generator.. just flip the coin 256 times and enter HTHHTHHHTTT etc as the passphrase. You can verify it on multiple brainwallet programs to make sure it gives the same key. You could convert the binary directly into a private key, but the brainwallet provides a handy tool to do almost the same thing.

I doubt it will really help you.. they can still see who you're calling/txting and figure out who you are based on that.. for example maybe one of your friends has your phone number and name sync'd to google contacts, skype or WhatsApp or any other app that uploads contact info to the 'cloud'/nsa.

obviously it doesn't have to be one or the other.. but Kenya probably isn't in the top 10.. might happen some day, once a few other countries have mass adopted it.

heh. well whatever. I think it's pretty funny that people want to downvote me for poopoo'ing an article that's basically completely made up.. there are hardly any Kenyan bitcoin users.. sure maybe it will take off there, but where's the evidence? Why there and not say Argentina or Iran - two places where it actually has tangible advantages for the local population? Really - show me any evidence at all.. there isn't any. It's cool that Kenya has lots of cellphones, but so does every country in the world. Everyone has a cellphone. It doesn't say anything about whether or not bitcoin will be adopted.. maybe it will, maybe not.

hmm yea. maybe.. but right now hardly anyone in Kenya uses it.. not convinced Kenya will be amongst the first places to see 'wide scale' adoption.
