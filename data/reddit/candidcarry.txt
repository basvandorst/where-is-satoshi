Not really. At the time BTC was *worth* $1000. It's supply and demand. When it was $1000, demand for BTC was high because there was a lot of confidence that the value of BTC would rise. Maybe it was a bubble, maybe it was knee-jerk too high, you can say what you want about it, but at that moment it was worth $1000 and people were willing to pay $1000 and people were willing to give you $1000 worth of other goods (cash, service, products) for a BTC.
Things can change in value. Would you say someone is stupid for buying a Picasso painting for hundreds of millions of dollars when it cost Picasso less than $50 to make? Especially when Picasso's paintings will only increase in value given that, you know, he's fucking dead?
Or what about people who paid a ton of $1000's of dollars for a cell phone back in the day, when now when you can get one for less than $20? It was certainly worth $1000's for a cell phone for certain people back then, who *made* money off them despite being so expensive at the time. BTC had a value that high too because it was worth it to people at the time.
Or are people just delusional? It seems to me that you just don't know what you are talking about.

Why? It's a free market, and it's a good thing that the market is so liquid. As we can see, it really didn't affect anyone. The price when the whale put this order in was what, around $350? It dropped around $250 when people panicked but it largely didn't change much, it stayed around $320.

If you think BTC is only worth $50 at the moment I'll glady buy all your BTC for $55/ea. 
BTC worth, like anything, is based on supply and demand. Fiat currency also has no intrinsic value, but people want it because enough people demand it (a catch-22 of sorts, sure). It's definitely worth more than $50 at the moment.

Considering it's been dropping for a year now, it'll probably just keep sliding down.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:05:51
Why do you say that? Don't you think the $300 wall will be eaten up, dude has cashed out his 40,000, and it will only go up?
@_date: 2014-10-06 08:44:59
Yea but BTC has been consistently going down for a year now...
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:02:56
I just bought 2 bitcoins because this is cool

There's nothing delusional about the price of something. It's what it's worth because there are many buy and sell orders. There was a very good reason to believe the value of BTC to be at $1000 at the time. 
You're just as delusional, if not more delusional, than anything thinking BTC is going to be worth $1000. You have no fucking idea what BTC will be worth, none of do. We can make educated guesses, but no one really knows.
But to say it's only worth $50, you better have some damn good reasoning about why you think that. We've seen BTC around $300 many times, and we've seen $1000 before. We've never seen $50 asides from the early days.
Take Tulips. Surely you are aware of the history of tulips. Were people stupid to be paying so much for tulips back in the day? No. It just was at the price because of supply and demand. 
Obviously buy low, sell high, but trying to figure out what is high and low is risky and a gamble. There was good reason to believe that $1000 would be low, and I'm pretty sure everyone here thinks $1000 will be far surpassed in the not-too-far future.

How so? I'm just looking for something to display the market price of BTC, not like my bitcoins or what the value of my wallet is.
@_date: 2014-10-07 06:39:34
Okay... I mean windows 8, or a driver for a GPU, are definitely not full of key loggers or viruses. I don't see the issue here. I'm so confused here. Like bitcoin wallet isn't going to steal your shit if you download it from the site. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 03:42:23
Are those a sure way to get my coins stolen?
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:04:55
So let me see if I'm understanding this correctly...
So a 'whale' put in an order for 40,000 BTC to be sold at $300... what does that mean exactly? Does that mean he put an order on some exchange saying 'If BTC is at $300, sell, until all 40,000 are gone'? 
So the price is now hovering below that wall because no one wants to eat at that wall? So how long will BTC stay at or below $300?
Am I getting that right?
And the theories are that it's either someone rich cashing out (someone with an inactive wallet for a long time), or that it's someone trying to scare people into selling so the price can be dropped further? In which case, wouldn't just selling 40,000 BTC at market price driven the price down a lot quicker?
@_date: 2014-10-07 06:36:57
blockchain. I mean if those are scam programs, maybe I shouldn't download them? How is this like not sure?
@_date: 2014-10-06 05:48:20


Wait, he didn't just go to a single market and place his huge order there? What exactly happened? I thought the news was that 'we' saw the 28,000 BTC  somewhere. If he placed multiple buy orders, how do we know it's the same guy? What exactly did he place, a $301, $302, etc buy orders at various markets based on, I assume, their different fees?
So what *exactly* is the wall at? Can't we see which market he placed his highest sell order at, and then know the wall is at X level *exactly*? Does this mean there's basically multiple walls spread across multiple markets?
If that's the case, why don't we all just buy our BTC from the same market, and just tear one of the walls down. Then, the price of BTC on a particular market would be way different (higher?) than every other market, and the rush of people buying only from that market would force the whale to close his other buy orders? Right?
I mean... if there's 5 fish markets, and someone is being a whale in all these markets, we could work together to see which market has the smallest wall. Then, we all tear go to this particular fish market, buy out the wall, and then celebrate at this particular fish market. He would be forced to stop selling at the other fish markets because no one would go to them anymore.


I've only heard $300, which is why I'm confused because I see the price of BTC fluidly fluctuating around $280 to $320ish. I mean if it was multiple walls on multiple markets, wouldn't the price 'step' around rather than linearly go up and down (err linear isn't the right word, but more 'smoothly' go up and down)?


interesting... so we know, and the whale must know, that his order will not be completed today? When exactly will it be completed?
But see I'm a bit confused here, there isn't only 100 fish being bought. There's *usually* only 100 fish being bought. If I, a fish hobbyist of sorts, saw that suddenly fish was being sold ultra cheap, I would just go to the market and become a sushi chef, and buy them.
In fact, that's exactly what I'm doing. I've had a couple BTC here and there, but today is the first time I've actually bought BTC for the purpose of not spending them immediately or gifting them. Like because this new sushi guy came in with cheap fish, there's now me, the 21st sushi chef.
There might be so many people like me who suddenly want to buy fish, that didnt before because it was too expensive, that the whale might actually sell all of his fish?
what is the ulterior motive though, or rather, what's the point of it? I get it, he wants to buy BTC at the low - if that's the case, I should buy now, at $300. Or better yet, try to predict right before the whale pulls out.
But let's say the whale's plan works, and he cancels his order and makes a big buy. What will happen to the price of BTC? Will it skyrocket 200%, or will it still be around $300-400 and still be a great time to buy?
What happens if his plan doesn't work and we eat his wall, us new sushi chefs? What will happen to the price? Won't it still be around $300-400 and be a good time to buy?
I'm just trying to figure out what this means, what should I be doing. 
I get that no one can predict the future, but I want to know *what exactly* I'm betting against. If I am buying now, what am I risking? When you are informed and are buying now, what does that mean you believe?
Finally, where can i track what's happening to the wall or buy order? 
@_date: 2014-10-06 08:51:41
Why is this guy downvoted? Wasn't it a legitimate theory that a whale put this order in so the price would be severely undercut, and then he would cancel the order and buy a ton of coin himself while at the reduced price?
In which case, we find that we called his bluff, and simply devoured his wall?
But what I'm confused about, is what difference does it make to us, like if this was a ploy for a whale to buy low... then that means we should be buying. And if it was just some guy cashing out... then that means we should be buying. 
I don't see what difference it makes, I guess?
I just want to know what i'm risking when I'm buying right now.
Also... BTC has been on a downward trend for a year now. I think it's just going to keep dropping...
i mean i still bought a ton of BTC today because I'm a sheep.
@_date: 2014-10-06 02:49:24
Wait, can the guy just cancel his sell order? I'm a bit confused. He puts 30,000 BTC to be sold at $300, they don't get sold, price drops, and then what, he says 'nah cancel my order'? How can you cancel an order you made? I don't get it. Does it just back the ones he didn't manage to sell?
And then what, since the price has dropped from other sellers, he just buys a bunch of BTC?
So why is the price of BTC above $300 right now? How is that possible if there's a 'wall'? Does that mean people bought up his wall and his plan didn't work?
I'm confused - is this the time to buy, or should I be trying to buy when I predict will be right before the whale makes his wall-cancellation and big buy?
And do we know that he's going to do this cancel-order thing? Or is this just a theory? The price of BTC has been dropping steadily for a while now, couldn't it just be someone cashing out?
