I think a better comparison would be a bank or credit union whose management behave irresponsibly/fraudulently and cause the bank to fail (but are small enough to where they will be put into conservatorship rather than gain a competitive advantage by holding regulators/the economy hostage)
That process is fairly invisible to the general public. The men in black basically come in, change the signs, and the FDIC's big ass put option is exercised to make the depositors whole with fresh money. When it happens in Bitcoin the legal recourse and collateral damage is much more nebulous and severe due to lack of unified international criminal law enforcement and the much smaller scale of bitcoin's ecosystem compared to the dollar (if a bank got robbed for as great a proportion of dollars as finex did bitcoin the dollar would also likely be less resilient for this reason, it's just nearly unimaginable). In the end it amounts to bitcoin needing a much higher degree of involvement and knowledge in its trading and use than the dollar. Risk management is really the only way to deal with it, i.e. limiting the amount of your deposits on a given exchange at any time to a level where the perceived returns are greater than the hit youd take in the chance it fails. It also helps to have experience and develop a feel for characteristics of bad exchanges. You can never be totally protected but there are good ones and bad ones. Insider theft seems to be the biggest risk

Also would be nice to know from bitgo
1. Did bitgo think it was shady when finex requested this kind of setup?
2. Did money play a role in their decision to go with it anyway?
3. How much were they paid for their "service"?
4. Were they shocked when something shady indeed happened?

Right now they look at least complicit for allowing such a setup in the first place without saying anything publically. They basically provided a service to bitfinex to allow an exit scam while making it seem like they had bulletproof security. Their silence/lack of attempt to do anything but scrub their website of insurance info is telling.

Coins-e had the exact same scenario happen with deposits in dogecoin around jan 6th. My deposit, same thing, sent to a big old chain of addresses leading to a mega wallet. They have been silent, but I'd have some hope for coinedup as their admins have had good communication and presence on reddit.
If the site did get hacked, it should just be a lesson in what you can trust in crypto trading. Which is seemingly almost nothing. I've started searching twitter and reddit for up to the minute problems before any deposit. Sucks too because I loved coins-e and now it seems that cryptsy, as the only exchange with human faces behind it, is the only legit option. 
 I think you have a +50% chance of getting it back given coinedup's stake in this but if they stole it there isn't any recourse. All you can do is wait and make noise so others dont fall into the same situation and make potential thieves richer

@_date: 2014-02-10 19:13:59
Option 1: Bitcoin is in a bubble and there are widely incorrect perceptions of its value; there isnt real demand for bitcoins at the +500$ level
Option 2: A whale or wealthy organization taking advantage of overblown negative news and making it appear that Option 1 is the case. If this is true, they plan to spend 5-10x+ what they slammed into the bids once panic sellers drive the price low enough, because they believe in the long term price of bitcoin and want to take advantage of panic and their market power to make easy money.
Option 3: Some kind of fat finger/algo gone bad/horrible mistake happened somewhere
Option 4: genuine panic among large/small participants
Can anyone think of other options?

I think you're giving the author too much credit. If he is a statist, he is shilling for someone. I think it's more likely he just doesn't understand bitcoin because of a lack of knowledge about finance and economic theories and history. IMO the economic side of bitcoin is a much greater leap of faith/more difficult to truly believe in for the average person without much of an understanding of monetary economics or history than the technical side. 
Everyone deals with money constantly. These days less and less is cash and is flat out credit or a debit system but even fiat cash is a money substitute from a macro perspective. Many people do not question where money comes from and do not spend any amount of time understanding it beyond chasing it constantly. This is fine.. money is a practical thing. But to understand the power of bitcoin in its limited current adoption and its future potential you need to at a minimum understand the hisotrical properties of money and the current global financial system and where bitcoin fits in. 
In the article he appeals to authority of "financial experts" and tries to paint them as broadly having figured out and written off bitcoin as a scam. This is obviously not true to anyone involved in the space to any degree.

I wish this would happen and succeed so badly. Truly one of the killer apps for bitcoin and would be revolutionary if it got to scale.

For whatever it is worth, this is a huge red herring and the FED of all institutions should know it. The fact that ACH transfers take 3-7 days is not a flaw in Bitcoin and is not the reason that arbitrages persist. The price on a given exchange also incorporates the markets perception of counterparty risk, the perceived safety of holding a balance on that exchange (i.e. the chance you will be able to withdraw it successfully in a regular time). The best example of this was the divergence seen with Mt. Gox prices in the end days.

You could also say that since the event was known about so far in advance that bitcoin's market cap is the combined value and the market had priced it in over the past months. That's how I see it as opposed to being created out of thin air, all else equal. But I do think that there is a huge amount of friction in the BCH blockchain as well right now due to its slow mining and several large exchanges not releasing it to their users yet, as well as many people not having taken the time to claim theirs yet whether they are waiting to see what happens or are just not motivated to do it for whatever reason.

Anyone who sees it can get your coins in a very difficult to discover way if they can remember it and wanted to. I think it'd probably depend on your situation and how complicated it was. Maybe keeping written on a piece of paper at a safety deposit box at a bank could work, although you'd want to make sure that there was no way the box could be accessed without being able to find out after the fact. 
I am not an estate planner and do not know much about how wills are handled and how many people look at them but if multiple parties were looking at the will, it could be a disaster if it were printed in the open. That's the main thing I'd want to stress to you, anyone who sees it and can remember it can steal your bitcoins, so keep it very secret.

Well if you scam people in the billions you can get away with it... (see Jon Corzine, Ken Lay whose death was almost certainly faked, all of the Major investment banks on a daily basis, etc.) Dishonest behavior is institutionalized and accepted by now. Insider trading is alpha... unless you are a good "example" to be made and aren't super rich like Martha Stewart.
White collar crime in the financial sector is probably the best possible crime in terms of risk/reward. I've known more than one super rich trust fund kid whose dad was in "jail" for enormous frauds yet they still have millions to hundreds of millions. It's actually pretty common. It's kind of a cost of doing business. How many high profile prosecutions have there been since all the dishonest shit that has come to light after the 2007-2008 crash? Basically bernie madoff and that indian guy from goldman sachs. Yeah, they were the ONLY ones doing anything wrong. The industry itself has certainly not been corrupted beyond saving for 30 yeard. No, "markets" are fair and functional. :)
I think bitcoin fraudsters will be way disproportionately prosecuted than bankers though (and for crimes involving paltry sums compared to the traditional frauds). Mostly because its good press and makes bitcoin less appealing to the mainstream.

I agree for the most part. Most of the value in youtube for these people is its userbase, with the secondary benefit of being able to handle massive audiences reliably. Nothing is stopping these content creators from simply making their own websites with a bitcoin donation address or selling goods for bitcoin, putting a bitcoin mention at the end with their "like, subscribe now" etc. Obviously it is better to have no sideline advertising/metadata hustle occurring but the majority of people go for familiarity and reliability until they perceive things to be so bad as to be forced to change. I do think that more of these people should probably embrace bitcoin though, if not for the fact that it's very easy to do (if you can read and know how to copy/paste) and what is the risk, really? It doesn't have to be one or the other.

What you are saying could in some way be true. If it is, I think it could be imagined as a feature. If you look at the fruits of the last 100 years under the fiat system there has been much wealth created but humanity has also become an existential threat to itself largely due to an incentive structure that places growth above all else and is rife with states of localized corruption that enable it to march forward unchallenged regardless of what happens. Bitcoin could provide an alternative to industrial growth, the military industrial complex, wall street, etc. If more Ivy League grads are dropping out rather than working 90 hour weeks for Goldman Sachs is humanity going to be worse off? I don't foresee bitcoin replacing fiat currency as a likely scenario and I don't think it needs to be, but if it ever did and this problem really arose I don't think genuine progress would slow but your point is worth considering.

This article had some interesting parts but it's getting pretty tiresome to hear over and over about how Jamie Dimon laughs at bitcoin because VISA can do enough transactions per second to sell the world 60 times over. Or that bitcoin is some overcomplicated and overpriced scam with no value proposition that nobody wants because paypal is already better. Bitcoin is doing just fine taking it slow and in a free market manner in developing its parameters to best suit use. 
Bitcoin's value proposition is political in the sense that it is an apolitical ownership/transactory asset. Bitcoin is the purest and best ownership asset ever seen except in the area of value stability. Since we are at a relatively extreme point in the overall distribution process, this will be an issue for the foreseeable future, but the die has already been cast in motion. The real estate on the world's most secure blockchain (as in most expensive to attack by a far margin) is becoming occupied and people who see the value in bitcoin are thrilled that the value is not yet stable. Mostly because we realize that the value will stablize either at zero or at a number much higher in dollar terms than today's prices. It will be the last piece of the puzzle. Scaling transactions should be left to the people it is left to, as the system is designed. Just because some hotshot consultant thinks that we need to increase the blocksize doesn't matter. The people who are true experts with skin in the game get to decide. Plenty of young wall street people have seen this and are buying bitcoin. Whether the old wall street crowd this article intends to scare with such a headline  can see past it is overall a very temporary and irrelevant issue.

For the average person: you want to own bitcoin but are willing to pay a fee in order to do it in a way where you have no liability and a good chance of getting your money back if the coins are stolen. Much like how in theory a gold ETF is good to buy because you don't have to worry about storing and securing it.
For institutions: Many institutions may want to buy bitcoin but might not be able to given their charters, which might say something like you can only buy registered securities. They are also much more used to buying ETFs than something like bitcoin which is an entirely new asset class and is intimidating to manage a large amount of unless you are an expert.
I have not read the prospectus (if it exists) for any of these bitcoin ETFs by the way but I'm assuming that the way they will work is to simply convert new dollars coming in through purchases of shares into bitcoin which is held in segregated accounts. Anything where your coins are not kept in segregated cold wallets or where the fund is using some mix of cash/treasuries and bitcoin derivatives is an entirely different beast.
