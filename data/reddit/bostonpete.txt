This is extremely valid and important.  If Bitcoin is ever going to get serious adoption, we can't have people losing their money!
It's not like the companies involved here are no-name companies either.  This is Google!  This is blockchain.info!  These are big names in this space and they have lost more than $1000 of OP's money.

What laws were broken?  Who was defrauded?
This Progressive meme that "bankers should be prosecuted for the recession" falls apart at the slightest skepticism.

Closing in on one month of downtime in the Boston area...  I contacted support about two weeks ago (on May 18) and they said "We do not have a set time frame, but we are hoping to get stores back up and running in a week or so."

I don't think there is a correlation with Liberty reserve.  I've been working with LibertyX for a long time now.  They started with BTC ATMs in the Boston/Cambridge area before they moved on to this PIN system.  I am pretty sure LibertyX is a startup created by a couple of MIT graduates.

The employer stole his work product.  The exact same as when  you download and listen to a digital copy of a song without paying.
You've rationalized your theft under an anti-corporate ideology that has you hideously proud of your blatant immorality.  Reading your comments is like watching a grisly car accident unfold before my eyes.  I can't stop watching but I feel like I want to puke.

When someone creates something and offers it for sale, taking it without paying is theft.  Theft is immoral.  Not because someone says so but because theft is objectively immoral.
Your attitude is shocking in its aggressive simple-mindedness.

The libertarian viewpoint is that *excessive* government is immoral or impractical.  I don't think that any libertarian would hold that police or courts should not exist to provide citizens with a recourse when they have been victimized.
It is well within mainstream libertarianism for police, courts, and military to all exist as government funded services for all citizens.

I do see the difference in the push vs pull aspect.  It will be harder to retain subscribers using the bitcoin model as you lose the ability for an auto-renew.
But, if we accept this, then we still need a system of alerting customers to renew and another for the owner to add/remove access for subscribers as they pay or do not pay the monthly fee.  This system is what I am looking for and does not seem to exist.
Streamium.io is interesting but not quite the model here as the content being delivered is not simply a stream; rather it is multimedia based.

Do not buy!  Check the URL and you'll see it's not the site you think it is.

This should pretty much be the copy/paste response to any "is BTC a scam?" type posts.  Well written!
