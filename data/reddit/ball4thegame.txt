Hi Milkfrog, 
This is Gabe with Coinapult. As is happens, our CEO is actually out of the office visiting the soon-to-be-announced island speaking with officials regarding the event and the Bitcoin Drop itself. 
We are early in our recruitment efforts for this project, and already have strong partners including as Aspen Insurance, Lamassu, and Bitcoin Beauties [edit: just found out the College Crypto Network will also be partnering with us!]. I am unaware of a minimum goal that we are aiming for, but we believe if MIT can raise 7-figure sums to give btc to college students, we would like to achieve the same for the Bit Drop (and are working hard to do so). We should have more details coming out over the next few days to address these questions further.
Coinapult is actually one of the earliest Bitcoin companies in the space, having started in 2012. Our e-wallet for email and SMS has been available for years, and we have focused on B2B services until our recent launch of Locks and our new website. 
Give Locks a try and let us know what you think! Sure wish I would have Locked some coins over the last day or two....smh!

Is there a way to fund this campaign in Bitcoin? I don't see anything mentioned on the indiegogo page
@_date: 2014-01-14 01:58:37
I guess it depends on how many students choose to seek out their bitcoin-trigger-happy classmate. If it's only 6 of them, good for them :) If not, the next batch can be split up into .001's
@_date: 2014-02-02 09:10:47
I presume Coinapult will be added to the brochure? :)
@_date: 2014-10-02 12:14:44
There is no sign-up process for using Locks. so you don't have to link a bank acct or spend weeks verifying paperwork. Lowers the barrier to entry, especially for the 50% of the world that doesn't have a bank account.

hello sir, who are you? sent you a pm, hoping to get in touch. thanks,

ugh, downvoted.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:59:36
im curious, did you end up using either service? which one? how was it?
@_date: 2015-08-02 11:45:54
wow! would love to see a Coinapult API plugin!

Crypto Capital offers the most bitcoin-friendly banking there is. Their API and backend is integrated into a number of bitcoin services/wallets/exchanges.
@_date: 2015-07-10 13:10:06
Love Mycelium, this looks like a great introduction for new users!
Super excited for the Coinapult API to be added to Mycelium. Anyone will be able to store fiat values, in their Mycelium wallet, and send/receive over the Bitcoin network! It will be super simple to introduce new users to the ecosystem :)

the bulb won't transmit any light until you tip the electrician, though, so keep that in mind.

hi cointastical. There are a number of costs associated with operating our free-to-use wallet, API, and website (including mining txn fees), but our business sustains itself by providing our brokerage services.

first go to the accounts tab. then, click the key button in the top right corner to add a new account. then, select Coinapult USD account. You'll be able to go back and forth from your Mycelium acct to your Coinapult USD acct within the Mycelium app :)

Former BitReserve users may find Coinapult.com to be a more privacy-friendly service :)
@_date: 2015-10-17 17:20:32
have you tried using the Coinapult integration with Mycelium?
@_date: 2015-10-01 19:14:41
just a few thousand dollars worth I believe

Hi everyone, Gabriel from Coinapult here. Just to explain what happened, our Coinapult twitter account was compromised by a hacker, who began promoting a fake "bitcoin giveaway" where users would send coins, and Coinapult would supposedly return +110% of the amount sent. We've fixed the breach, taken on new security procedures, and helped out those who were tricked into sending coins. Stay vigilant, Bitcoin community :)
