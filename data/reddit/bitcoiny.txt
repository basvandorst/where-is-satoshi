There's a pretty big list here:

It's possible, but you'd have to keep USD ready in each exchange rather than waiting for it to move about. And you'd probably want a bot to do the trading.

TOKYO - JAPAN - April 12, 2013   
Resuming Operation: Now what?  
As announced yesterday, ( we have decided last night ( to shutdown all trades for 12hrs.  This decision was made based on two major factors.  
1) Trade Engine Lag
We have seen an astonishing growth in both volume and number of people joining Mt.Gox and trading on our platform. While we were ready and expected to see the number of new customers and trade rising, we did not anticipate such AMAZING growth that has been partially translated in visible and unbearable trade engine lag.  
To fix this issue, we decided to make some major changes in our hardware infrastructure. It is now capable of handling 50 times more of the trades than in the past, giving us more time to release our new and improved trade engine, which is scheduled to be launched within a month.  
2) DDoS 
We have seen our fair share of DDoS attack in the past, but the shear volume of the DDoS we received in the past couple of day was rather important with a peak at 80Gbps. Despite our service provider's best effort, we had a lot of difficulties to handle both our user growth and the DDoS.
What’s next?  
Technically speaking, we are now ready to better handle our exchange's rapid growth and assure normal operation. As far as the DDoS are concerned, we are still fine-tuning our security features and actively working on implementing a solution that will drastically protect us from such huge attack in the future. 
But rest assured that we are taking this situation very seriously, and that we are doing everything in our power to protect the Exchange and your trade from such attacks.   
Even as we speak, we are still being attacked by a yet unknown group of people that have clearly an intention in hurting Mt.Gox and Bitcoin as a whole. But rest assured that we are not giving up and are dedicated to win this, one way or another!  
What will happen to all the pending trades?  
This has been discussed at length here at Mt.Gox. We have decided that we will not flush the order book before trading resumes. We have no intention in proactively clearing people’s order regardless of what’s happening, and we will let people be the judge of what’s best with their order. 
There is no doubt that we are expecting a violent crash of Bitcoin after trading resumes, but we are confident that this Panic Sell will be temporarily and that Bitcoin will rise again.  
Also active immediately, we will waive all trading fees for the next 48hrs (Starting from 11am today JST).  
Finally  
Again, thank you for your continued support. Despite suffering one of the most impressive DDoS that we ever seen, we are doing everything in our power to overcome this situation and to restore stability and confidence in our exchange.  
Mt.Gox Co. Ltd Team.

Yeah the API still seems to be up, just frozen:

That's interesting, if London wants to remain the center of finance it would be an obvious thing to get into the bitcoin market early. Obviously they want to monitor trades as they do with bank accounts, to counter tax evasion and criminal activity or whatever, but this would legitimise bitcoin in a big way and help with widespread adoption in the UK and beyond.

Not sure about other banks, but I've only been charged £4 per transfer with HSBC.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:40:58
Yeah I guess it could be good for Bitcoin, it's just the fact that they have their own unit of currency too that makes me a bit suspicious...


@_date: 2013-05-09 19:44:36
Ah ok I read that wrong :P
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:25:57
I've never even used Transferwise to get money into Bitstamp, just make a payment directly to Bitstamp using your online banking. For HSBC, click "Send Money Overseas" and enter Bitstamp's details (I had to look up the postcode which is SI1000). It should be as easy as that, the SEPA protocol takes care of the rest. Has anyone tried this with other banks?
@_date: 2013-04-29 00:50:59
Bought a Bitcoin on Tuesday,
We were trading Bitcoins by Wednesday,
And on Thursday, Friday and Saturday,
We chilled on Sunday.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:54:23
Economically it's not.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:41:07
I don't think it did, it was either a DDoS (through a botnet attack or high-frequency trading i.e. all those 0.01 trades) or just massive interest (Mt.Gox's official line). Either way, as proven in the past, when Mt. Gox lags or goes down, people panic and sell.  This time the lag reached ridiculous levels (1hr+) so the mass sell off was inevitable.
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:41:19
Exactly, I've never used them. Just make a payment directly to Bitstamp using your online banking. For HSBC, click "Send Money Overseas" and enter Bitstamp's details (I had to look up the postcode which is SI1000). It should be as easy as that, the SEPA protocol takes care of the rest.

It says 2015 now, looks like they've updated it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:40:27
I guess we'll find out in just over an hour
@_date: 2013-05-09 19:38:08
I don't see Bitcoin mentioned...
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:21:54
I think its likely to hit $250 again in the next few weeks/months. This is only the beginning. We hit a wall with Mt.Gox not being able to scale, but that's slowly getting sorted now. I would definitely wait.
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:02:28
Lots of the people who bought high (many of whom will have invested more than they could afford) are panic selling as the price moves lower and shows no signs of recovery towards their original buy price. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy as these are the same people who are causing the market to drop by their willingness to sell at increasingly lower prices.
When these people are exhausted, or realise that the sensible thing is to hold for the longer term, the market will again begin to move up. There's a large amount of people coming on board wanting to buy, it's just that right now they're getting an abundant cheap supply from these guys.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:21:54
Well if not corrupt, then at least "controlling" governments. Bitcoin has the chance to give the power and wealth back to the people. I accept there's volatility right now, but it's still very early on. 
There needs to be a large influx of money to support large transactions in the future, so we're going to see this volatility and profiteering on the way up. But it will stabilize.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:18:41
Yeah I agree the idea is more important than the price, but if we want Bitcoin to be universal, then a massive influx of wealth is needed.  You can't make a $600 million transfer through Bitcoin if the market cap is $500 million.  Or even a $50 million transfer without distorting the market.  A large market cap will bring stability to the price.
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:33:27
It works for HSBC, just enter "SI1000" for the postcode (that's missing from the Bitstamp banking info).
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:34:28
This is what I'm talking about, the drop in confidence is not actually linked to the technology at all.  Bitcoin remains the same well-tested, well thought out, 4-year-old technology that it was before the drop. 
I still believe it will go mainstream, it's just going to take some time. We knew it would. We need more stable exchanges (+ more of them), improved clients, more places to spend etc.
I just think we should stop being so down on Bitcoin, as if it's all over. "How much did you lose?" etc. In my opinion, we haven't lost anything.  The market dropped due to the reasons mentioned, but there's no reason why it won't rebound again given the underlying fundamentals of Bitcoin itself. Short term thinking is the problem here.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:38:34
That's really useful but its huge, are there any params to get the last x trades etc?
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:10:14
Good news everyone!
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:17:57
Good stuff. Given that it's the biggest issue right now, what are your plans for DDoS protection?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:35:58
It is when it's used to confiscate your savings, as in Cyprus, or devalue your savings through QE, as in the US, UK and elsewhere. Who knows what's coming next, the world isn't exactly looking stable right now.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:36:28
They make money from fees, it's like any other business. The more users, the more cash you make, the more you can spend on hosting etc.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:31:23
Security through obscurity is a bad idea
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:27:50
Actually a cup of tea would be lovely, thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:39:11
HSBC charge me £4 per transfer, someone else mentioned Barclays charging £15. The exchange rate is different to the very latest, but not by much as far as I can tell.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:20:17
Yes! That would make perfect sense for Bitcoin. The client and protocol is open source, the exchange software should be too. It would increase transparency, and allow others to easily set up exchanges (more competition, less dependency on mtgox).
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:09:10


@_date: 2013-04-12 00:44:47
So it was the DDoS / overwhelming demand?
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:34:31
Nice idea, I'm sure that could be created fairly easily with a fork of the Bitcoin-Qt client. Start a new blockchain containing only these public escrow addresses, and just tailor the client for trading.  Of course, you'd want to integrate the 2 clients at some stage.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:23:24
Fair point, but would a large upfront investment really be needed to cover currency transfer costs? Wouldn't cash flow from the transaction fees cover that? Just curious as to why it would be so expensive.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:00:09
A botnet takes control of a bunch of PCs (usually through malware). It then instructs them all to remotely visit the intended target site at the same time. To the site being attacked, these requests just look like any other normal visitor, coming in from different IP addresses around the world. So its very difficult to determine which requests to block, and which are genuine and should be allowed.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:11:43
This is the great thing about Bitcoin, those of us who believe in the idea WILL come together to fix the problems. The recent boom can only be good in the long run, in terms of bringing these issues to the fore and expanding the pool of talent for fixing them. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:31:07
I remember reading that a few years ago, scarily accurate!
