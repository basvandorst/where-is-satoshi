Not really, I think you are doing it right. bitcoin (I'm not talking about Bitcoin the protocol/technology here) is a currency and you are treating it as such which benefits it. It's when people just hoard BTC in the hopes that it will make them rich that they can do the currency harm. After all, if everyone just hoarded instead of actually using it as a viable currency then bitcoin (the currency) would go nowhere fast.
There are a lot of people who own parts of a bitcoin and have yet to get/make a whole one. I shouldn't worry about it too much; I think you are doing fine.

Agreed, except that in your life time the amount of coins available will be far less than 21m. Also have to take into account that [there are approx]( 13,025,500m coins in circulation at the moment, of which about 1-3 million may already be lost due to lost wallets, forgotten passphrases, users dying (bit dark, but true) and not giving someone access to their coins after death etc.

[BitBargain.co.uk]( is where I used to buy mine. Until you verify though you are limited to buying 0.5BTC a day. Once verified, which doesn't take long, there is no limit.
I never had an issue using Santander in the UK buying them there. Just make sure that you read the buying instructions carefully. Buying only normally takes a few mins if that, and they are in your wallet. Then you can transfer them from your BitBargain wallet to wherever you want.

It's not tied to the value of the dollar. People cashing in their BTC to $ would obviously be affected, but those who cash into other currencies that are not affected will be fine, unless there is a serious knock on effect.
If that were to happen I'd probably just keep my BTC until the $ started to improve.
@_date: 2014-03-28 13:07:08
This. 
The key word is 'decentralization'. If Visa/Mastercard etc were to suddenly announce that they were bringing out a digital currency backed by dollars, I would hope that most savvy people would avoid it due to the control that these companies would have over the currency in question.
The reason that I found Bitcoin to be such an attractive investment in the first place was mainly due to it's decentralization and the fact that no one person/company could have control over its growth.

Kinda like on 15th August 2010 when Bitcoin had to do it after someone hacked 92 billion in existance.
[Here is the ANN thread]( with a member pointing out the 'Value Out' error in block 
The devs had to make a decision to roll back and save the coin. Had they not, Bitcoin would be a distant memory now.
The Vericoin devs did the same type of thing to save the coin.
@_date: 2014-07-29 13:18:03
Also, people who were already invested in BTC and use the dollar may try to retain some of their $ value by buying as much BTC as they could, pushing the price of BTC up. Investors from other countries would start buying up as well, just to be on the safe side, increasing the price further.
When the dollar recovers you may see a slight drop in BTC price due to people cashing out to $ again, or may keep a decent amount of BTC due to stability.
Just a guess.
@_date: 2014-06-09 12:55:39
Wrong. VRC is PoS meaning that you can't mine directly.

**More information**
Flexcoin is shutting down.
On March 2nd 2014 Flexcoin was attacked and robbed of all coins in the hot wallet. The attacker made off with 896 BTC, dividing them into these two addresses:
As Flexcoin does not have the resources, assets, or otherwise to come back from this loss, we are closing our doors immediately.
Users who put their coins into cold storage will be contacted by Flexcoin and asked to verify their identity. Once identified, cold storage coins will be transferred out free of charge. Cold storage coins were held offline and not within reach of the attacker. All other users will be directed to Flexcoin's "Terms of service" located at "Flexcoin.com/118.html" a document which was agreed on, upon signing up with Flexcoin.
Flexcoin will attempt to work with law enforcement to trace the source of the hack.
Updates will be posted on twitter as soon as they become available.

First things first, contact Coinbase and explain the situation.
Couple of things you can do/should do when using GAuth:
Head to your [Google Security settings]( area and change GAuth to SMS/Voice (That will affect your Google accounts not Coinbase). Also add a backup number should you wish to use that in an emergency in the future for situations like this.
If you had made backup codes (a lot of people don't bother and regret it later) then use one of those, or the string of text (Secret Code) that you will have gotton when setting up 2FA on Coinbase (or other sites using GA)
Use Authy for Coinbase when you have solved you issue as it will make the recovery process easier for you.
In the [Coinbase FAQ](

Yeh, I wrote a couple of articles on my site in 2011 regarding his adoption of 'Pay $5 and watch when and where you want' that also allowed people from any geographical location access to the video's without restriction.
Let's hope he gets the messages of support for a BTC payment system. The more people like Louis that start allowing BTC (and other coins) can only be good for cryptocurrencies as a whole.
@_date: 2014-07-17 11:10:09


But you would have to set a parameter to define what constitutes lost coins. For example, Satoshi has about 1m BTC in his/her/their wallet which hasn't been touched. You would have to decide as to whether these coins are indeed lost/ forgotten or being held in storage till whenever he/she/they decide to sell some.
Also, that would have a negative affect on the price of the coin. As more coins are lost over time, which is inevitable due to human error,  the coins that remain will/should have a greater value.
@_date: 2014-07-18 00:31:19
I foresee an influx of wallets that will have a decentralised exchange capability included within the wallet itself. These regulations really are pointless and act more like the big finance players in the US attempting to regulate/strong arm something that they know they have no control over.
@_date: 2014-07-22 14:40:38
You wait; the moment someone, or an external body, manages to figure out a way to make having a standard recognised bank as part of the equation for opening or starting a bitcoin venture; then it will be at that point that the banks will be screaming to accept new BTC based customers and maybe even actively advertising for them as the money they will be missing out on will be unacceptable.
As it stands, banks are terrified that Bitcoin, beit the protocol or the coin, will start to one day take a chunk out of their profits. Which it will and very soon. Trying to ignore BTC and attempting to just make it go away, isn't going to happen.

Yep, a lot of people forget about this, or were not around when the vulnerability was first abused. If they had of done nothing, then bitcoin (the currency) would be completely worthless now.
The Vericoin devs made a decision to protect the investors and acted quickly doing so. If they had of just left it, then VRC would have also died.
People not invested in the coin will of course scream and rant about the devs decision, but at the end of the day I think they were correct in what they did in protecting the investors. They did not, unlike many would have you believe, do this to protect MintPal.

I know that adoption is very low at the moment, but do you also have any links near where the BTC option is that can also send the user to another site (or pref a page on your site) that explain what Bitcoin is, why it benefits the user and perhaps a video for people that hate reading  a slew of text. This is something that most if not all sites that offer Bitcoin as a payment option should do, as it will benefit them and the community as whole.
It will get there though. I spend quite a bit of time trying to explain to my friends what BTC is and why they should start getting involved, but these things take time.
Good luck though.

Just out of curiosity, would adding information for your various purchases using the blockchain.info wallet make those purchases public in any way?
@_date: 2014-03-28 16:57:59


True. There are 2 types of miner.
1. Mine as much as possible and then sell quickly for a fast profit
2. Start mining a coin that they have faith in, knowing that you are going to hold the coins for a while. This to me personally is better as you never know what the price of the coin may be a few months/years down the road. Bitcoin is a prime example of this.
I understand why people want a fast turnaround in profit, but sometimes it makes more sense to stick with a coin you believe in and watch you profits grow over time.
@_date: 2014-07-10 09:18:22

As soon as you have any BTC (or other altcoins) in your Blockchain wallet, I always transfer it straight to my [Armory wallet.]( (It's safe and free and you should look into using it.)
Most sites will advise that you don't keep your coins in the wallets that the sites create for you when buying/selling for security purposes. The only time I ever have coins in my online wallet (not Blockchain) is for trading purposes. The rest I store using Armory.

Why not create an average of the top 3 exchanges and base the value on that. Don't include Mt Gox in this though, but keep the price updated in real-time as the value of cryptocurrencies changed very quickly due to their volatility.

I keep 50% and use the other 50% to trade with alt coins. Have made a decent amount that way. Then when I have made a profit trading alts, the rest goes back into my BTC desktop wallet.

@_date: 2014-04-14 15:33:17
Yep, it was a PoW coin for the first week where it could be mined. When it hit the 10,000th block, mining stopped and it became a PoS coin. It took approx 1 week to transition from PoW to PoS.
You can still mine for Blackcoin, but not in the same way that other coins are mined for. The Blackcoin Pool (known as multipool) was created and mines other profitable alts and then using their own algorithm, exchanges those mined alts for BTC which is then converted to BC (Blackcoins) to pay the miners. The multi pool basically creates a constant buy pressure.
You can also Stake using your wallet (this is how the network is made more secure) by leaving it open. (but still encrypted, so to send coins you still need your passphrase, so **don't** just unlock it via Settings&gt;Unlock wallet) This gives you approx 1% of your current holdings over the course of a year. Staking starts about 8hrs or so after you start the Staking process.
I wrote an article explaining the Blackcoin wallet and how Staking works if you want to read it. Mainly written for some of my friends who were looking to start investing in Blackcoin, so it's not meant to be very techy.
[Here is the article if you are interested.](

Agreed. I invested my 3.5 BTC that was sitting there not really doing anything into Blackcoin when it was 3500 sats last month. That 3.5 BTC is now 72 BTC. Cashed out my 3.5 BTC last week so I have my original investment safe again, so I will see how far this coin can go.

This. If it works in the same way as the cryptolocker virus then removing the virus can cause more issues especially if you actually want to pay up and get access to your data again. The private key created during the encryption process is created and remains on the C&amp;C server until payment is made.
You may get lucky and be able to get some of your data back by other methods like having VSS enabled or via a system restore in rare cases, but this isn't guaranteed and 99% of the time, you are screwed.
See [here]( and [here](
The Cryptolocker virus also infects any PC connected on the network, so make sure you have remedied this. Always, always make sure you have up to date backups.
You may also want to install and use the [CryptoPrevent tool]( from FoolishIT. It's free to use, and the Pro version has a few extra benefits like automatic updates and can be used on multiple PC's.

Looks great. Will it have a way to alert you when one of your coins has hit a certain price, and if so can you make it so that we are able to select our own alarm for this.

Could be a great opportunity for OpenBazaar.

I have just checked their [payment methods]( (so far they only accept Visa/Mastercard) and at the moment they don't accept bitcoin. However, maybe this will open their eyes to how much control they don't actually have over their own company finances when it comes to how they can receive money from clients.
I have asked them via Twitter if they have any plans to accept BTC in the future, so will wait for a response.
A VPN that doesn't accept bitcoin isn't great, so maybe they will start to look in to this.
[Update] Looks like they are adding [alternative payment methods]( soon. Hopefully this will include bitcoin.

Tyler also commented on the article, 'All of the above', basically confirming that other alts are to be added to the exchange as well as users being able to trade (buy BTC/other alts) using other FIAT currencies as well.
any clues as to what other cryptocurrencies are to be added? Personally I'd love to see ETH or BTS added. Also, when you said, 'All of the above', regarding more FIAT currencies, were you alluding to the fact that people from other countries will now be able to use Gemini via their overseas bank accounts like Santander/HSBC/Lloyds bank etc?

1. I have always bought mine [via BitBargain.co.uk]( which is very simple to use, and only takes a few mins to buy and have your coins in your wallet. Until you are verified though, I believe that there is a max limit of 0.5BTC per day purchase, which becomes unlimited after getting verified which is a pretty simple and quick process. The reason for verification is for the security of the sellers I believe.
[Read the FAQ]( though, as there are some important things to know when buying.
2. Get a Trezor, and always remember to backup any passphrases/wallet.dat files you have (depending on what wallet/device you decide to use.)
@_date: 2015-09-25 13:21:58
Yep. That said, if someone close to them did have access to the wallet.dat file then there is a chance (depending on how decent the passphrase was) that they could get them back. Really small chance.
@_date: 2015-09-25 13:12:13
Good point. I would like to think that people will prefer to use BTC instead of FIAT in the future anyway as a means of payment.
Hopefully by then (12yrs from now) we will be able to make 100% of our purchases using BTC directly.

Ditto. Down in the UK for the past couple of hours.

Nice post. I have managed to get 5 of my friends interested in BTC over the past year now. 2 of which now invest a small amount.

Don't forget people that had invested in BTC, then passed away without passing on their keys to someone.

Actually he makes a good point. The majority of people (non-techies) will prefer a trusted third party to manage their BTC for them. Whilst it isn't advisable due to trusting someone else with your private keys, as has been shown many many times before, people will continue to use them. 
Personally I will always secure my own coins, but when BTC goes mainstream, there will be a need for a decent way for third parties to handle your BTC for you. By 'You', I mean the average person.

Honestly I have no idea as this is the first I have heard of it. That said if I were to guess I would say that it is another way of describing what bitcoin is. Basically when you are buying bitcoin (the currency) you are buying a share of the Bitcoin Network (Bitcoin's Blockchain)

One man having that much control over how BTC is bought and sold in NYC is scary, and something is very wrong that he is able to get away with it.

This is only approx for the USD-GBP price for BTC in March 2011:
If you had of purchased £100 worth of BTC then, it would now be worth £27,040. That is if you had kept it all till now.
Used [Preev]( for BTC price (as of posting) and [X-rates]( for USD price history.
Maths isn't my strong suit so it will need checking. Feb 2011 – April 2011 was when BTC took parity with BTC in terms of dollar (USD) worth.
@_date: 2015-11-04 02:48:47
No worries. Interestingly, the word, 'bitcoin', only appears 6,257 times. I would have figured more?
Not certain as how up to date the site is though.
[Edit] It's fully up to date.

He hasn't specified which blockchain MegaNet will be using. It could very well be Bitcoins BC, but he may also be creating his own cryptocurrency.
Either way, it will be very interesting to see how this project develops.

So should this bill be allowed to pass, (hopefully not) would the US gov them be allowed to seize all BTC and other crypto from US based exchanges if it seems fit. If that happens, what will non-US investors be able to do in order to get their funds back.
I don't keeps my investments on exchanges for this very reason, however, there are plenty that do or may have temp BTC/crypto on an exchange when a seizure happens.
