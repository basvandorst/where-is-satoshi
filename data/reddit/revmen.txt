Would love to know what it's about.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:38:42
That's the point.
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:10:53
Bitcoin can't compete as a currency against new-generation DLT's that have figured out 0-fee and instant transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:05:48
It costs somebody who only has a few bucks the same amount of money to do a transaction as somebody who has millions.
$1 may not matter to the guy with millions, but to the guy who makes $2 a day, that's way too much.
Bitcoin is unusable for anything other than sending and storing large chunks of value. It'll never be useful as a currency.

Hey man, buy Bitcoin if you believe in it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:16:01
The interface is hard to get information out of. Buys and sells on different pages that you have to select from a menu. No chart. Hard to see the order book.
And top of all that they have the highest fees.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:42:03
So you fucked her dad?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:49:02
By this definition, anything can be a currency.

There was a significant period of time when the term "blackberry" was just a way of saying "smartphone."
like the way that "kleenex" means "tissue" and the way that "bitcoin" means "cryptocurrency."
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:04:39
Not an issue for you, sure. But that interface is a non-starter for me or for anyone who wants to know what the market is doing.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:41:35
That actually isn't too silly.

With the definition of value being the ability to get other people to do things for you or give you stuff for it. If you can't transfer it, it has no value.

Have you tried using Gemini? It *suuuuuuucks*.

That goes back further than the 90's. I was in school in the 80's and we were drawing them then.

These are the qualifications needed to invest in a hedge fund or other non-reporting investment firm. Hedge funds are not allowed to advertise and can only take on investors who are either accredited or previously known to the manager. 
This is in place for a reason.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:47:43
Does the software support that? I thought it was limited to 8 digits.
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:17:05
Of course.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:59:03
Not all crypto is bitcoin.
And if you're at an American gas station, you can't use Euros, either.
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:09:08
Sometimes it is.

Anyone who actually knows the answer to this question won't be answering it.

For now...

If you have a Coinbase account, you have a GDAX account. Use that instead. It's possible to operate on GDAX with no fees whatsoever.

I assume you named the boy Satoshi.

It isn't. Please don't succumb to the FUD.
The coordinator exists as an alternative to the random walk algorithm to prevent attacks that may be possible due to the currently small size of the network. The default implementation uses the coordinator, but it's possible to switch any node to random walk and it would operate just fine.

How do you know this is a floor?
@_date: 2019-02-01 09:13:22
I think you misunderstood what the article tells you.
@_date: 2019-02-01 09:36:02
What in that passage conflicts with what I wrote?

They can also be lost. Would be tough to lose a billion dollars in gold.
@_date: 2019-04-08 12:59:19
How does that work? 
@_date: 2019-01-29 15:11:37
It's because they don't want to give up that much cash. They may not even have it.

Again, there is no such thing as excess electricity. It has to go somewhere, and that somewhere is through the loads that are currently connected to the grid.
What this article claims is that miners in China are able to take advantage of unused hydro capacity. It's not that they make electricity that isn't used, it's that they're capable of making more electricity than they're currently selling.
@_date: 2019-01-31 20:02:28


Yes. They consume less water head. They do this by opening the gate less so that less water flows through the dam.


I don't know how a grid-connected solar plant works. I'm sure that they don't design them so that they can't control how much energy they're putting into the grid.
@_date: 2019-01-29 19:13:55
And where did they get the BTC that they can sell?
@_date: 2019-01-31 15:26:36
There is no such thing as electricity that would simply vanish.
If excess power goes into the grid, it doesn't vanish, it causes the grid frequency to rise. Operators don't want that to happen, so they dial back the amount of coal/gas/water head being consumed to prevent it.

It can't be a commodity because bitcoins are not fungible. I think the only crypto that could be considered fungible right now is Monero.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:26:33
Bot author here.
It doesn't work that way.
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:39:43
It's not very different from receiving coins for mining, so I'm pretty sure you'd have to consider it income. The value of the income and the cost basis for a sale would both be fair market value when you received it.

MySpace was ubiquitous but annoying. Awful backgrounds and endless animated gifs. Then Facebook came along with its clean, non-customizable look and a focus on creating a feed for you instead of your friends.
Bitcoin is ubiquitous but annoying. Slow transfers. Endless drama. And technically unable to actually be a world currency due to the pinch point that is a blockchain.
And then along comes IOTA's tangle, which is completely user focused. No fees, scaling only limited by bandwidth, and it gets faster as more people use it.
Bitcoin is a long ways from dead, but its time is limited. When we reach the point that people are wanting to actually use crypto and not just speculate on it, people aren't going to put up with the limitations blockchains, at least as far as currency goes.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:22:45
I take "Bitcoin" the same way I take "Kleenex" when the context is anything but a conversation about Bitcoin specifically: as a generic term for cryptocurrency.
I don't think Bitcoin itself can be used as an everyday currency for the masses because a blockchain is not a good tool for that, even with fancy add-ons like Lightning or whatever. Something Tangle-based is where this is all going, maybe even IOTA.
For now, though, "bitcoin" is what people recognize.
