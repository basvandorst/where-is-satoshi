Yeah I know I'm late to the party, and there are a lot more current problems.  Though I had to make a new account and had to deal with this bullshit.

What I'm asking is if there's a way I can just to it myself?
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:07:28
Okay thank you!

There's no ATM's, and localbtc doesn't have in active members in my community.

I'd rather pay a fee than have my personal card, or bank account connected.

That email metaphor made me see it very easily!  Thanks for the info, I guess I'll have to try some bitcoin laundering/mixing service.  Do you have any recommendations other that the one previously mentioned?

Just downloaded mycelium, you can not actually buy bitcoin off the app.  Not even going to bother looking on my laptop.

Maybe! ;) It's just that if I'm going to get into bitcoin I might as well anonymize it, because why not? :)

If there any card that is easier to use than others?
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:25:22
Yessir I am

I appreciate it but coincards.com is exchanging coin for gift cards

It’s not greed when money you’re fairly trading is skimmed a little of the top just because it was a good deal. You don’t call a victim of theft greedy because they got stolen from and want it back.

I just tried to buy some coin and on the very first page where it prompts for the amount I want it says service unavailable due to my location when I’m in a state specified on the list of states you serve. What gives?
