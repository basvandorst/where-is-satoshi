Keyword “possible” not probable. It’s like having 21 bitcoin and being in the million club (some used to call this the 21 club). It’s just a random weird factoid. Not a reality. In reality some people have 10,000 bitcoin and some people have 0.000001

If you put $2M into a investment that returns 10%/year, you would get $200K/year return, more than enough to live on. That means when BTC is worth $500K, you only need 4 BTC to make the same $200K/year salary for sitting on the beach all day. The extra 2.15 is for boats and hos

Bitcoin is a digitally scarce asset that is evolving from a commodity like gold to a currency over time. The best way to take advantage is to simply buy a piece of a bitcoin and then hold it for 5-10 years.

Always a good time to buy, but whatever you put into bitcoin you should be prepared not to touch it for ten years or longer. Don’t think you’re going to get rich quick here.

I was telling friends in early 17 that the price would go to 3500 lol nobody saw 20k coming anyone who says otherwise is lying. I would only ever invest in bitcoin. Privacy coins will exist, but the question you need to be  asking yourself is to what degree will they capture market share.

There’s only three ways to get rich. Hard work, inheritance, or investing. Most people in the upper middle class have some combination of all three. I’d say my net worth is half from the social class I was born into. 25% from hard work and 25% from investing. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:05:13
Actually my father died and I used inherited money to pay off my house. Haven’t sold a single coin since I bought 3 years ago. The point is I’ve been hodling for 36 months now. Technically I’m down 440k from this same time last year. 
@_date: 2019-05-18 02:36:34
Sounds like you didn’t elect to use a passphrase so you’re good. Should probably use a passphrase though.
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:24:33
I think you answered your own first question. In response to your second question, bitcoin is a free market. Free markets have inefficiencies. They move toward effeciency over time, but the process is one of people trying their very best to exploit those inefficiencies. Yesterday somebody found a good exploit and likely profited. The market will now be more immune to this specific type of exploit and will gain efficiency. I can assure you the traditional markets are much more manipulated and controlled then bitcoin is.
@_date: 2019-05-18 15:42:41
Regular job. I’m planning to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars so I wouldn’t dream of spending any bitcoin now.

When I came into bitcoin back in ‘14 there was no bch only btc. Bcash is centralized sock puppetry, I sold all the bcash I got from the fork for bitcoin back in ‘17. Bcash is run by like 4 marketing guys, all the high end devs have been and will continue to work on btc. Plus to say I disagree entirely with their approach to scaling would be an understatement lol

@_date: 2019-05-17 19:52:49
I think we’ve already seen that wealthy bitcoiners have a hard time breaking social consensus. Look at Roger ver and the bcash fiasco. UASF will not always be the tactic, but I do believe it will be very hard to break nakamoto consensus for the foreseeable future.

I had been aware of bitcoin since 2011, but after looking into the Silk Road decided it was to sketch to buy DMT and send it through the mail. So I backed out. The friend I had talked with about bitcoin came up to me at the bar in 2013 when bitcoin hit its then ATH. I stared into my phone the rest of the night despondent, reading article after article thinking I had missed out on a once in a lifetime opportunity to be rich. Fast forward to Christmas 2014 I left a casino after a drunken night of blackjack with $5,000. I still felt like gambling but knew from experience that I was likely to give it all back if I kept going. I checked bitcoin and saw it was close to a 52 week low. My though process was basically hey this seems cheap in comparison to when it was $1,200 so I bought 22 coins for 5k. I had lost all my savings in college by day trading the stock market and was determined not to make the same mistake so I started reading as much as I could about bitcoin. Once I fell down the rabbit hole I became convinced that bitcoin was the financial black swan I had been waiting for and I started piling more of the money from my job into weekly buys. Basically bought all through 2015 when the price was low, no special thought process. I’ve paid $185 for a bitcoin and I’ve paid $16,000 for a bitcoin. I literally have no fucking idea when is a good time to sell and when is a good time to buy. I just buy and hodl. I wish I had started buying sooner, but I’ll tell you this I didn’t buy much in 17 or 18 but I’m back to buying heavily now.

Bitcoin will take at least that long to take over the world. If you can’t wait that long jump ship now.

I don’t know what it’s like in Germany. But my father went to a third tier law school and worked his way up to general counsel of a large corporation. Was making 250k consistently for the past 20 years. Your English is good, why don’t you move?
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:27:39
I’m up 12x right now. The people who win this game will be the people with the most patience. 
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:30:28
Key word ideological. Ask yourself this, how is pos an improvement over the way we currently do things
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:05:41
Probably like $60
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:52:38
Has your investment thesis changed? If it hasn’t then you should hold tight. If you were hoping to make a quick buck though you should bail. We might go down.
@_date: 2018-12-31 21:50:51
I really hate seeing people use the phrase crypto on this sub. It’s bitcoin. Thanks in advance.
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:42:33
I post this every year. 
@_date: 2018-12-24 07:02:50
Hodl. Didn’t sell any during ‘17. For ideological reasons I do not want to write Uncle Sam a check for 500k 
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:16:25
I did inherit some significant money this year. That said I post this every year regardless of what happens in my life. I just feel like people in my situation aren’t as honest about money as they should be. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:12:34
Haha nope wish I had cashed out a little though! Even just 10 coins was 200k. Oh well lol 
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:47:32
I hodl hard as fuck, never trade and I’ve seen too many dips to count. The price action right now feels very similar to a move we had in 15 that went from $220 to $460 back to $330.
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:31:15
Suck it nerds. Enjoy the fucking ride
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:09:44
More confident. Much more. 
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:53:26
The hacker isn’t dumb enough to send them back to binance without washing them through another exchange first.
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:06:46
He’s asking if he when he reboots to another HW if it will ask for his passphrase not about how it’s generated.
@_date: 2018-12-15 05:07:41
Go for it I guess. That’s not much money so you can afford to gamble.
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:36:06
Good move. It will pay off in time. 30 months from now at the latest in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:57:44
Not in regard to bitcoin bud
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:51:04
Just spreading coins to different addresses/wallets in an attempt to obfuscate your trail. The binance hackers are doing this as we speak. Honestly the simplest way to shuffle your personal holdings is to send them to an exchange and then withdraw them. You’ll have entirely different coins then the ones you sent in.
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:17:28
There’s only one indicator that matters in my opinion. The Mayer multiple.
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:44:14
Solidly in anger.
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:06:31
Fuck crypto. Bitcoin&gt;everything
@_date: 2019-05-18 15:36:34
For small amounts under 10k cashapp. For large amounts over 10k Gemini, coinbase pro, kraken, binance. That said I don’t think it’s safe to leave coins on any of the above. Not your keys, not your coins.
@_date: 2018-12-16 01:07:03
I mainly agree with you. I’m not overly bearish, but I do think it’s important to prepare for a worst case scenario. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:18:47
Fuck yeah! Proud of you for your restraint. If murad is right and 1 bitcoin has the future purchasing power of 10 million current usd, in 40-50 years time you could be worth 100 million in today’s dollars. I’ll see you at the marina ;) look for me, I’ll be the mega yacht named the S.S. Satoshi hodlmoto
@_date: 2018-12-27 17:37:49
Fuck that 
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:40:29
2.8 million by 2030 minimum 
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:57:33
@_date: 2019-05-19 03:39:43
That’s exactly who I am equating them too, because that’s what they are.
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:50:16
I do. I make 300k so it seems dumb to quit. So I just keep buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-18 22:48:38
It will definitely be hyped again. This time by Wall Street and major players in finance
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:40:41
Right but the pin and the passphrase aren’t the same thing dude
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:46:08
Everything is possible but not everything is probable. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 14:41:51
0.1 could be 20k next bull run
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:24:47
Well you have to time adjust the advice. You can’t apply the same strategies they do at the same scale yet 
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:35:32
Nope! When I bought my first bitcoin I told myself I’d hodl til 2030 at least. So that’s what I’m doing.
@_date: 2019-05-18 02:35:56
If you didn’t elect to put a passphrase on your hw then you’re fine. Sounds like you didn’t.
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:35:15
Yes precisely. 
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:53:58
What you call design constraints I call security parameters. Bitcoin fees are expensive because they are valuable. Nano is dogshit.
@_date: 2018-12-16 03:11:40
I think this post is accurate as a worst case scenario 
@_date: 2019-05-18 15:38:17
I’m 100% bitcoin and I will be for the foreseeable future. If we can’t converge on a single currency then we won’t have non sovereign money. Either bitcoin wins or everything dies. It’s that simple.
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:03:30
Bro this guys wife doesn’t know how to do that lol
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:59:03
All the coin is in cold storage man, it would be really annoying to go through the many step process to document it. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:06:13
Eventually, but not five years. Although that billion would be like Venezuelan currency then lol
@_date: 2018-12-28 22:33:09
Yep. All things that should be considered 
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:39:23
Every halving will affect bitcoin, but as the world gets woke to the idea of a halving I think more and more it will be priced in. Bitcoin will have many many more major bubbles, greater then 7.
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:03:39
Wanna hear a worse one? Im down 450k on this dip alone. Bitcoin is wild.
@_date: 2019-05-18 00:15:58
A lot of people, myself included engrave our seeds onto metal in case of fire. It’s definitely a good practice. Paper wallets are a perfectly acceptable cold storage solution, appeal to people that want to go through their own key generation etc... more of a diy crowd. Trezor is just easier.
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:57:11
If you bought now and it went to 100k that would be 31x, if you ride it to a million that’s 317x 
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:23:18
My advice is to make sure you’re good in all other areas of your financial life and only put in an amount of money you’re comfortable not touching for 10+ years. 1 whole bitcoin is always a good goal to shoot for, but may not be attainable. Do a budget and decide what you can reasonably live on and then invest the rest.
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:12:00
You sound like this guy who used to work with my wife. He heard I had invested in bitcoin and told her “if I was your husband I would have sold at 19k”. Sure thing buckaroo, except you work a shitty job for a living and I’m financially independent at 29. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 07:57:33
I take the opposite approach. 100% BTC and even during this low I’m still up 15x, during the top I was up 92x. If we hit 100k next top I’ll be up 475x 
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:47:59
Tons. Your number one wealth building tool is your income. You’ll never get rich working for someone else. So start a side hustle. Next always live on less then you make, avoid lifestyle inflation. Take risk adjusted bets. It was scary as hell putting money into bitcoin back in early 2015, but I put in what I was comfortable losing and saw massive returns (even now at the lows). Be comfortable with people making fun of you for not going out and wasting money on crap. Make your habits automatic so you never have to think about it. Hang out with other rich people. Learn how they think, do business with them. (50k is a value price to someone who is wealthy). Read 25-50 non fiction books a year. Track and measure your net worth obsessively in the beginning. Enjoy the process. 
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:39:39
Store of value is just part of bitcoins evolution, it is already a more dominate medium of exchange and unit of account then any other crypto asset.
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:45:43
“top 10” Lololol it starts right below bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:46:24
This man outranks me. I am not worthy in your presence sir.
@_date: 2019-05-18 02:35:48
If you didn’t elect to put a passphrase on your hw then you’re fine. Sounds like you didn’t.
@_date: 2018-12-28 14:55:55
Inheritance 
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:17:40
Make sure you keep your seed and store it some place safe
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:28:26
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:40:00
No, if you look at the historical data mining pools come and go. No major player has dominated for very long.
@_date: 2018-12-16 00:35:17
30 months from now? 10k
@_date: 2018-12-12 02:31:18
HODLING IS USING
@_date: 2018-12-25 15:50:18
Coinbase has power in the space and they lobby regulators. They’re dangerous.
@_date: 2019-05-18 02:45:37
You most likely never put a passphrase on your wallet so you’re fine
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:41:57
Just means to dump bitcoin for tether. Don’t do it. Tether is only 70% backed. At some point it’s going to go up in flames.
@_date: 2018-12-14 12:31:18
Solid plan. I hope you get there! Don’t stop at 2 though gotta go for 2.1, that puts you in the 10 million club.
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:48:39
Not on pizza, but I definitely blew greater then 10 coins gambling. Probably closer to 20. Feels bad man lol
