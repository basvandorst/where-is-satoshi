Compensation, no. Additional features and privacy, yes, that's the catalyst.

I see your point, but I believe that there is more good than evil in a free market. The "size" of the risk you mention also decreases with ~~more~~ mass adoption.
There are many problems, but I don't feel this one is cause for worry, although I do not live in the USA.

So....  You wouldn't pay your rent?  Is that what you mean?  You would just hodl? But then you'd get evicted. So wouldn't you actually then be spending some, and hodl ing the rest? Your point don't really hodl up. If you need something, buy it. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 09:41:30
Awesome! Really enjoyed it.
@_date: 2014-05-13 10:31:11
That's a lot of FUD in respect to murders and such. At this point we do know that bitcoin has not funded any wars. So there's that. This aids in enforcing your right to privacy in and of numbers.
A spade is a spade.
@_date: 2014-11-26 18:33:33
If that thing you need to live or be comfortable is only attainable with bitcoin, your going to buy it. Not starve or freeze to death. Bitcoin is a drop in the ocean so its "fluctuations" are inevitable for now. Once again, if you need something, then buy it.

This is awesome, if possible you should make mention of the bandwidth usage once opened. Some countries charge on internet usage not throughput. I have been running a full node, but I need to rate limit it to keepwithin my budget.

Bitcoin protocol does not give two shits about the general public, or any individual really. As long as your keys are safe it's doing its job just fine. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 21:16:41
What items do you need to live or be comfortable that are only attainable by ~~bitcoin~~ usd?

Whoa! That's my partners coffee cart! she has staff on who don't really know much about btc yet. Good on you Squirby! hope it was not to painful to purchase? did you get a chai or coffee? I wish I was there, I'm at home looking after our son. I'll be there tomorrow though. Just looking at her wallet on block chain but no recent transaction? It should have been at a discounted rate anyway If it does comes through I will reimburse you the discount. :) - ah the power of the block chain!

@_date: 2014-11-27 04:53:08
You can buy those things with Btc also... So yeah.

How would this (escrow) be implemented on the blockchain? It's a burning question I've had for some time.

Well mine is not even a credit card. Its a visa/master debit card that I can use online (pre paid credit card). QuickBitcoins order form did not even ask me about credit card details of any sort any way so it must be my name or phone number. ? go figure. I can understand the difficulty though. I am glad to see the effort to get Bitcoins to everyone!
@_date: 2012-07-19 10:10:01
Sounds likes an awesome idea!

Didn't work for me... failed verification....  shame. I am in NZ - not that it should matter.
@_date: 2011-05-08 23:20:44
Looking good, adding my 370MHash. Would be nice to see the pool hash stat in the top right of the page have a couple of decimal places after it? eg: 7.840 GHash, Other than that and the comming reward details and minned stats etc its looking good. 8)
@_date: 2011-05-24 08:01:24
That's a good choice, mining asisde, I don't think windows can handle moar than 4 gpu cores.
@_date: 2011-05-18 08:51:06
Where did you hear other reports of pools being down? currently the network is at 2.160 Thash/s... more than yesterday.
@_date: 2011-05-11 22:07:38
 Nice one Rex! Balance page looking right, what is your wallet ID address so I can send you some coin? Or perhaps you should put it on the "about" page. Keeping you busy.....   8)
@_date: 2011-05-18 11:39:57
It’s possible the dent in the network was replaced by the attacker's seamlessly endless resources, but still can't a point in that until just after the difficulty increases.
@_date: 2011-05-23 10:35:11

The algorithm has little data to work off based on new difficulty level to provide a correct network total throughput. Give it 12 hours. happens after every increase.

Chilling pool side, since checking in at the front end I got paid out from the previous days contribution. Is that a timely coincidence? Nice graffs.

In UK here, noticed this a lot since the increase in minners. also my balance page was at 2.1 then went to zero. now its at 1.3? no pay recieved since 20 hrs ago.. ?

Select other from server drop down list. In the host field enter: mtred.com Port field: 8337. Username and password of your miner credentials set in  and then select your GPU ( if you’re running a 5xxx Series ATI card set the Extra Flags field to: -v -w128 )

MOAR BITS!!
@_date: 2013-04-21 08:18:03
This is a good idea, however why not up it one and just stick a bitcoin logo/plan b sticker of the same size as the other master card / visa accepted here stickers on the front door /establishment. - You accept btc here? "well no i don't you’re like the 5th person that has asked me that today."... Would be nice if you could make the sticker known to the community so that you didn’t have to mention you’re asking because you saw the sticker. But the sticker gave you enough run up and excitement of actual acceptance that you remembered to ask any way.
@_date: 2013-05-23 11:07:33
hardleft! you da man. Makes complete sense. Thanks for helping the community out as always!
@_date: 2013-03-02 10:08:49
Woah, [these]( will be plugged in one day.... 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:55:29
All the sell orders at btc-e are mostly less than a coin. Similar to what the bots were selling off at to manipulate the market on mt gox. I also believe a lot of account holders there are pushing altcoins of much lower valune. This is good will let a lot more people in to buy for the next mountain climb. 
@_date: 2013-05-30 11:53:07
Well, with bitcoin it would be publicly available due to the ledger.
With cash, well sure, as long as I could still spend my worth or if they could reimburse me with something other than my now confiscated evidence so I could pay my rent.
No I would not care to cover tracks of someone elses wrong doing.
Unless it was for good. e.g;Wiki-leaks or something similar maybe.
@_date: 2013-04-15 02:43:51
Yea, but its solar!!!!
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:35:57
Its a store of value! Just risk what you can afford to loose. No one knows the future. 1 BTC is divisible to 100,000 slices or *shatoshi's*... at the forth(?) decimal point we have **mBTC**'s , So at the $100.00 USD to BTC mark we have parity with mBTC &gt; USD .. so its not a matter of how much you SHOULD buy, but how much you can afford to loose. be safe. READ enjoy, and learn, Its a lot to take in.
*edit: Also secure. You are you own security as you have control. there are many post here on securing your wallet.
@_date: 2013-03-06 04:40:39

Would be great to print cyrpto coins. with pre printed (etched effect) private keys under a tamper proof sticker. - or tamper proof plastic snap out to reveal the private key or QR code to spend. I want one too. need to fix the dishwasher.

I'm waiting for Part IV!
@_date: 2013-09-04 10:46:08
Yeah same here. OP -You don't need to go to the counter you can deposit from a westpac ATM, if you're unsure get a teller to show you how to use the ATM menu for this, take your bitnz deposit code with you. And don't do it on a Friday afternoon if your in a hurry.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:51:52
Yo da man!  Keep it comming fine sir! 
@_date: 2013-04-26 11:21:25

The same way they would react if it was fiat paper monies?
Disclaimer: I only read your title.
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:20:41
Or, panic sell. Paper wallet now empty?

Microwave, 2 seconds. Done. 
@_date: 2013-09-05 09:54:29


The bank Teller/counter.
 BitNZ is direct deposits only and has been for a long long time. - meaning you can only deposit your fiat cash into your bitnz account by walking into a westpac bank and depositing money into a bank account number provided by Bitnz. This process previously required an actual human (teller) at the counter to process your deposit. Now however you can do it from a ATM (in this case westpac ATM's only - and presumably ones outside/inside the actual bank).
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:03:01
Its missing "sell something"
