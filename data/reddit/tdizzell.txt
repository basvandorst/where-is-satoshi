Banks are relevant and likely always will be.The ones that don't evolve, however will be left behind. Babb is the evolution of banks(and it has nothing to do with BTC like the author of this post seems to thinkit does)

Sorry but I have to downvote this. I've been following Babb, and as of right now there are no plans to allow anyone to store their BTC in their bank account. It's a great project IMHO, but this is misleading about what they are doing.

I have looked at the black card. I've also chatted directly with the Babb team who has said that storing crypto other than the native Bax token is not currently in the plans. But if you want to keep carrying on with posts that look like you're shilling a crapcoin, go ahead. People expect Reddit to be full of garbage anyway and that's what you're making Babb look like.

Some people don't know about or understand btc, and the fees for using it are still relatively high. Babb is looking to make their solution very simple and user friendly. We will always need banks. Definitely not banks the way they are now, but some people will always want some sort of bank. And there is no one solution that will work for everybody. Btc is good for some, airtoken will be good for some and Babb will be good for some

Babb won't be letting people store BTC and use it to pay their bills, so it's a moot point about whose btc it will be. I'm not sure why this guy made this post, but he clearly doesn't know what's going on with Babb.

I'm not sure how using Blockchain technology to offer low cost banking services to over 2 billion people who currently don't have access to those services is a bad idea, but you're entitled to your opinion

What Babb is actually doing is a great idea. The guy that made this post doesn't know what he's talking about. Babb isn't doing anything with BTC or storing it in any account
