For now but in the future things may change. Also LN is not in any way proven and there's nothing out there for people to test. I don't get it.  We have a solution that's well known, has been tested out and can solve our problems very quickly.  Core have already said they will do a fork in 2017 so there's no reason we could not do the fork that Classic are proposing right now.

It was over capacity last week and transactions were being delayed for days.

This is very true. There are many other options for people who feel there's not enough progress going on.  New features are good but they do not solve the real problems that we have now.

Sounds like a Starbucks card but using a wallet.  I think its a good idea but not sure if LN will help in time as the network is already full to capacity.

"On one side of the debate, there is an immediate need to scale. Having a backlog of transactions kills the ability for bitcoin to be useful as a transactional tool and forces additional costs on businesses. Scaling now by increasing the block size would end this threat."
A good article that is pretty clear about how to solve the problem we have right now.

Used to be interesting but these days her podcasts are a complete waste of time.  She promotes everyone that sponsors her to the extreme.  Totally out of touch with reality these days.

I think we do need a bigger block size so you can make more transactions and we need that today not in 2017.

Not dead. If we can get people to stop focusing on the idea that a bitcoin block size increase is bad.  Core already agreed and now just a matter of waiting a year!
