Sounds like a "Digital Asset Holding" rebranding of the open-source blockchain technology.

For a little conspiracy theory: his indictment in Maryland on 10/1/13 could have been been brought against him simultaneous to his larger Silk Road arrest as a planned strategic red herring measure to product media hype and prejudice over the subsequent year. It did a pretty good job substantiating his "murder for hire" allegations even though the case actually hasn't been tried yet. In reality the indictment actually hasn't substantiated anything at all. But it's definitely proven to be a successful media hype.
Getting on the record now a prediction that this case will either be thrown out in court or he will be found not guilty.

As much as I agree you are entitled to your money on a stated and contractual basis, it would probably do you better to take it easy and be polite and more patient.

Just in, breaking news: Bricksquad beat the Football Team in a devastating 6-1 thrashing on the fields by the tennis courts. Bravo. Those FTballers were 2cocky.

Nigger_Loaf speaks on stupidity! Get your tickets here, ladies and gents!
Sorry OP. Sometimes the fineprint will get ya - Bitcoin's price is so volatile right now it's probably not in your best bet to buy days ahead. Coinbase started doing that when they started getting too many buy orders.
