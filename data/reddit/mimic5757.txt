Except at a muuuuuuuch smaller scale cmon man.  The difference is someone with 10 billion (maybe if you can convince him.). And 100’s and hundreds of billions.  
What is the point in being so pessimistic?  Do you honestly think it’s the same?  All the money going to one company as opposed to everyone keeping their money?  You ok man?

How?  All the money stays in MY wallet.  There is no central point where all the money goes and is used or loaned without my approval.

Convenient in the sense that it’s person to person.  No middle bank that takes 90% of your money and invests it.  It’s always there.  No bailout needed.
I find that more convenient for the world.  So I put up with a little personal inconvenience.
Need to pay mortgage?  Cash out.  Pay it.  But everything gets put right back into bitcoin.  Not letting those bastards take my money and invest it then ask the gov for money to pay us back.  Forget that bs.

These large banks control the world.  Fund both sides of every war.  And charge interest on them.  War = money to them.  I’d say I can do without the convenience.  Bitcoin is far
More convenient anyway.

I’m sure he thought it was legit at the start.  This Brent guy sounds like a class a douche.

It looks like they weren’t buying mining equipment with investor money.  As Weeks said in the indictment..  “taking money and not buying the equipment is wrong.”
