I had 2FA on my mining pool account but not dropbox. I had thought of maybe someone I know did it like accessed the first backup, but the drives can't just be accessed by anyone not even physically. The server cabinet is locked and so are the drive bays plus theres cctv. I'm the only one with keys. It must be dropbox, I guess I'll just have to wait for their technical team to get back to me about those log files.

Well, it is also stored on dropbox as a backup. But the event logs are showing no logins. I've sent a request to them for log files explaining the situation but I don't see it as likely as my dropbox password is a  long string of random letters and numbers. I found this digital forensics company that apparently can deal with issues like this. They're called Sytech. I'm gunna give them a call in the morning.

I don't really care about the money I just hate it when life gives you no explanation for how this stuff happens.

I kinda worked pretty hard to get the BTC that I did have if anything I just wanna make sure whoever stole it can't spend it. Apparently Sytech have been successful in the past at having bitcoin accounts seized/frozen.

Well, I'm gunna try anyway. At this point I'm just mostly curious as to how they've done it.

My wallet file is stored on a secure drive, I haven't used my account since 2014 nor any wallet software since then. I looked at my address on the blockchain today and saw that my balance was empty. When I was using it, I had bitcoin core on ubuntu.

The rules on the subreddit say I can't give out bitcoin addresses but the I was using Bitcoin Core on Ubuntu, my last login was in 2014. The back up was the 'wallet.dat' file that bitcoin core gives you, I made 2 copies. I put 1 in dropbox (probably the weakest link right there but my password is very long and no dictionary words) and the other an a drive with 256 bit AES encryption with another very long password containing symbols upper case lower case letters and numbers. The computer that had bitcoin core on hasn't been powered up since I last used my wallet in 2014.

Is there anything else that I might have that maybe I haven't thought of that could help me track down the ip address of the transaction? Even if it means dedicating a server, I have allot of computing power available to me if that helps.

Unfortunately I didn't realise at the time that I could password protect my wallet so no password. But every password I have is different and not easily memorable and are very long. I keep them all on a physical piece of paper inside a safe in my home.

No, the wallet file wasn't password protected (stupid me) but it is stored on a drive with heavy encryption. I'm seeing nothing in the authenticaitions logs on the server where the drive is that is out of the ordinary ether. And I think it was taken all at once, I'm seeing only one output on the blockchain website. The date on the transaction is 2016-03-28 21:57:11

I had thought of that except I haven't used bitcoin or accessed the file in 2 years, so why would they wait until now if they had the file back then. I also don't have dropbox installed on any of my devices, I only ever used the website and always made sure that the page was encrypted.
@_date: 2016-04-10 17:23:26
I have the address that the money went to and the address that that address sent the money to, and it's all still there not spent. I just don't know what I can do with it, the addresses I mean. My account was emptied 2016-03-28 21:57:11

The files weren't labeled as 'bitcoin' or anything just the date it was created. I will admit that 2 years ago I wasn't the smartest person when it came to security but these days it's a bit different. I can honesty say that there is no way anyone could have gotten access to the file stored locally on my servers, at least without me knowing about it. I has to be dropbox. I think I'm gunna have to do a little digging keep on at them until I get some answers maybe even involve the cops if need be. (my brother is a cop and he tells me that its theft/fraud no matter what.)

When I created the backups of the wallet I would replace the old dat every time the mining pool payed out just incase that file did contain newer info as I wan't sure. So the backup of my wallet file is the one just after I got my last payment which was on 2014-10-19.
