I don't trust these guys. I don't believe they will stock up on the gold or whatever asset/commodity they claim. At the end of the day, you have to trust what they tell you. If bitcoin goes up, you lose money. If bicoin goes down, they can become insolvent. It's a lose-lose situation.

@_date: 2015-06-08 23:18:36
You're right, sir. I made a very simple and rough model. Tweek it with numbers as you please.
@_date: 2015-06-08 12:50:43


M2 is not defined as debt generated money. Look at my definition. I know most m2 (not all) is created through loans / fractional reserving. But it-is-not-the-same. Imagine you borrow 1 bitcoin from a loaning institution in five years to buy a huge mansion. The seller would want a real bitcoin. The loaning institution is forced to have 100% reserving of the loan. Because they can't create bitcoin out of thin air like banks do today.

M0 (Coins and notes) are only a tiny fraction of money and the whole economy. Many people get their salary in to their bank account, pay their bills, buy their food without touching coins or notes. My model is not based on bitcoin replacing just coins and notes. It wouldn't make much sense. If that's the only real cash to you, you've never bought a house ;)

Even though m2 (includes savings deposits, money market mutual funds and other time deposits) is a result of fractional reserving, it's just as real as paper dollars. My house is bought with m2. Maybe it will be more difficult to run fractional reserving with bitcoin. But if bitcoin overtakes fiat currencies, it's fair to use the same total value of currencies as an estimate. Remember, this is just one model of many possible. But I believe it's pretty accurate despite it's simplisity.

Yes, and the thing is that you don't keep your bitcoins in a bank. You may of course lend them to a bank for interest rates, and they may loan them to others for a higher interest. That's cool with me. But the bank must have 100% reserve of what they lend out in this case (No bitcoin printing fractional reserving.)  It IS possible to do fractional reserving in some ways, but they will be more obvious.

@_date: 2015-06-08 14:55:23
I am unable because you can't make the distinction between m2 and fractional reserving. Fiat m2 is real. Inflationary, but real. My house, funded with m2, is real. My bitcoins, wich are my savings, are m2 per definition and real. Your denial - also real, lol!
@_date: 2015-06-08 12:36:59
My current supply of bitcoin is m2. It's a savings account. Fractional reserving and m2 is not the same.

I agree it's a very simple formula. I have seen other models, based on adding potential markets and multiplying it with an array of linear factors.
But I have never seen anybody starting with the total amount of money in the word and do an estimate of bitcoin's future value as a function of it's market share. That's why I did it. 
If you have seen this done before, please post a link here.

@_date: 2014-08-18 23:36:48
Not sure if you refer to my model (click the title of this thread) or the link posted by shibalicious, he he.
In my model, competitive crypto-currencies would just be a slice of the piechart of future market shares, and not affecting the formula.
You can also apply the same formula for other cryptocurrencies.
I am not making any predictions of either Bitcoin or any other currencies with my math. The market share is up to you to estimate ;-)
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:02:52
This is easy. Infinite inflation gives av value of zero. And the odds for people using a currency with zero value is... You guessed it, zero ;-)
@_date: 2014-08-18 21:09:36
I don't believe people have a pressure to use hyperinflation currencies. And I think it's a bit off topic. My mathematical model does not predict the future of bitcoin. It's just a rough estimate of the future value based on a market share you put into the formula ;-)
@_date: 2014-08-17 11:21:56
He he, with a 100% market share, one bitcoin would be worth U.S. $ 2.6 million with the numbers in my example ;-)

I haven't seen anyboy else point out that the market share is a variable in my formula. If I didn't use variables, it wouldn't be a model or formula. It would be just a number, he he. It's up to the user of the formula to estimate the market share.
@_date: 2014-08-18 23:23:19
My simple model is based on an assumption that the velocity is the same as today. People may trade faster or slower in the future, but I think it's reasonable to make this assumption. The reason I publish it, is because I have never seen anybody else starting with the total amount of money in the world and estimating the future value of Bitcoin as a function of it's market share. Please post a link here if you have seen it somewhere else.

I think user adoption will be the catalyst to drive the price up over time.
I have done a mathematical estimate here:
@_date: 2014-08-17 13:23:26
Actually, I think it does. It's all in the definition of Bitcoin_Market_Share. If this is 100%, it means we are only using bitcoin, and it's holding the same value as all fiat used to. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 22:31:50
@_date: 2015-05-22 11:20:46

Good idea to pay out in batches as a default. Maybe with Trezors and multisig? And people should still have the option to use a direct payout (arbitrage traders with little time to lose.)
EDIT: Free business idea: Write a batch payment script for Trezor. Not only useful for exchanges, but also for businesses with multiple payouts.

It makes sense to me. So, what I want is someone to make a html page that takes the 23 first words + a number from an 8 sided dice (the last 3 bits) as input and then makes the final 24th word.
I know it's a little rude to beg people to make stuff, but I will share the process with easy to use pdf forms and instructions. I want to use it as part of a consultation service, and could donate/pay the person making this html page. (Negotiate with me!)

@_date: 2015-05-08 00:57:28
3 dice with 8 sides and 1 dice with 4 sides. I will make "dice indexed" lists of the 2048 words in all the languages. And one last 8 side dice for the last 3 bits.
(I know each word could be made with just three dice. 2 dice with 16 sides and one dice with 8 sides. But I visited a "Dungeons &amp; Dragons" shop. They told me 16 sided dice are difficult to get / more rare, and they are not good because the geometry doesn't make them stable.)

I know that is secure. But I intend to use this as a part of a consultation service for rich investors without technical skills.

I will publish a pdf soon that makes it easy to pick the first 23 words with "Dungeons &amp; Dragons" dices and roll one 8 sided dice for the last 3 bits of entropy before the html page calculates the last word. Your site is very cool, and actually better than this solution when you trust the code. But my angle is to help rich investors to protect their precious coins with dices, Trezor and Cryptosteel ;)

I think 1 BTC is more reasonable, and we would both contribute to the eco system ;)
BUT: Bitcoin price could go through the roof any time, so I want to make the deal in USD. Let's say 240 USD in bitcoin.
AND: I can't promise you the bitcoin unless I get 1 paying client. You will just have to trust me.
I actually have a very good connection to potential clients. I will make PDF's with lists of the 2048 words in the different languages indexed with dice values and good, simple instructions how to use them. My procedure actually includes running your future web page on a cheap offline computer that is actually destroyed after the calculation of the last word.
Let's say that I have to show you the finished pdf before you send me the webpage to prove that I'm serious.
Sounds OK?

In Norway, bitcoin is held back by a VAT tax at 25%. (If you buy one bitcoin with norwegian Kroner (NOK), you are supposed to pay 25% on top of that.) BUT: BITCOIN IS WATER. You can't stop it with your hands! It finds the way around your fingers. As you said: Blockchain says no.

Great initiative! Just what we need. I cant't participate, but I think the solution to scalability could be to share the load dynamically between the miners. That means that a miner would just confirm a (dynamic) fraction of the transactions.

I don't think that has to be the definition. If all the wallets, exchanges, ATMs etc choose a fork with less hashingpower, everybody will call that fork bitcoin. It will also gain the hashingpower pretty quick and have a different set of core developers. I'm not trying to split hairs, sir. My point is just that the miners do not have all the power.

It's a huge spin to divert focus from bitcoin as a new currency. The "block chain technology" is nothing more than a database of transactions. The whole clue is about giving people incentives to mine. There is no way I can upload a hash of my appartment to prove it's mine. Sure, I can scan the documents and my neighbours property after a little Photoshop. And hash these documents (And "Put them on the block chain"). But it's just fraud. And in really poor countries, they don't have a scanner or anything. What they need, is the new currency. Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-04-12 19:27:57

You are really splitting hairs now. The average use is very close to the current limit, and spikes are crossing the limit. And don't expect transaction volume to grow in a linear fashion. In a network effect system like this, expect it to grow exponentially. Special interests will profit from crippeling the total transaction volume.

They store the value in dollar, so you miss the up swing of bitcoin if you use it as storage. I think the best way to use the ANX card is together with a Trezor and top up your card maybe every second day or something before you spend.

I think the premium is paid by people not willing to go out of their comfort zone. (Learn about keys and computer security and stuff, ha ha).
But many of these guys are skilled in trading. They can play with 150,000 bitcoin, buying and selling in their little sandbox. It will be interesting to see how it all plays out ;)
As far as I know, some of the registered players are big investment banks. An article in WSJ on the web, even called one of the askers (Citadel Securities) the right hand of federal reserve. This detail was later removed from the article on the web and did not appear in the paper article. I'm not kidding, because I took notice of this detail when I read the article the first time on the web ;)

Agreed. His company sells gold, and he sees bitcoin as a competitor. Because it is. Still, I think both bitcoin and gold will have a good future if the sh*t hits the fan with the US dollar. He mixes the concepts "money" and "commodity". He thinks gold has an intrinsic value (as a commodity) and that gives it good money properties. The truth is that if all the gold stored in vaults were given away and made to jewlery, it would be really tacky to wear a gold necklace, lol :D
He is like Mike Maloney, but Mike is starting to get the point with bitcoin.

New York broker dealer makes bitcoin bet
A New York-based broker-dealer has announced that it is open for business in trading blocks of bitcoin, marking what it says is a significant step in the "institutionalisation" of the digital currency.
Genesis Trading, a division of SecondMarket, a venue for trading shares of private companies and other esoteric assets, claims to be the only fully-licensed broker-dealer specializing in bitcoin, having carried out about 800,000 transactions worth over $300m over the past couple of years, reports Ben McLannahan in New York.
Genesis is now making a standalone business from that specialisation, carving itself out from SecondMarket with a 10-strong team of traders and support staff.
According to Brendan O'Connor, chief executive, the idea is to generate more business from the "north of 50" hedge funds and other private investors who have shown an interest in buying, selling and holding bitcoin.
"It is still early days," he said. "This idea you can have two parties that don't know each other come together and have a seamless, frictionless transaction at very little to no cost, in a decentralised environment, is revolutionary. Institutional interest is going to continue to grow."
Genesis' move to focus on bitcoin is part of a broader embrace of digital assets by figures on Wall Street.
Last month Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan executive who helped pioneer credit derivatives in the 1990s, said she was launching a venue for buyers and sellers of financial assets to meet and transact, switching currencies into bitcoin in order to cut the time and cost of settlement, while making use of the decentralised 'blockchain' as a secure record of transactions.
SecondMarket made its name offering a private market in Facebook shares before the initial public offering. It will continue to trade a range of illiquid assets, from auction-rate securities to bankruptcy claims to student loans. About 50,000 bitcoins are traded each day on public exchanges such as BitFinex, Bitstamp and Btce, according to Winkdex.
Just over 14m bitcoins are outstanding, giving the market a capitalization of $3.09bn.

Easy. Put a timer on every registration and a reminder email to the registered place when the time is about to expire. Then, they must confirm by clicking a link that they still accept bitcoin to continue the registration. The registered companies must be in charge of the registration, and could even pay a little fee in bitcoin to be registered.

To me, it sounds like their business idea is to receive bitcoin, and let people "hold it" in another currency/gold. They use public spot prices to calculate the "transfer" that never happens!
If bitcoin price goes up compared to the other currencies/assets, they can make a lot of money.
If bitcoin goes down, they will not be able to do the payouts...
I can not prove that it's a scam, but it smells like that to me.

No Bitpay is seriously weired. I get the feeling that the old "Bitcoin is not important, it's all about the blockchain" is in the back of the head of Rob Price, the writer.

4. Repeat step 2 and 3.

* Pay public employees in bitcoin. Maybe give some to all citizens.
* Watch bitcoin value go to the moon, and become one of the worlds richest nations ;-)
