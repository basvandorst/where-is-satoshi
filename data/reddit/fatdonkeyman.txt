Bitcoin is *NOT* anonymous, its pseudo-anonymous. Every transaction you make is recorded. 
The REAL advantage of Bitcoin is that its the first real digital currency, Bitcoin allows the world to truly enter the digital age. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 10:02:24
Its an unfair comparison, credit cards are not currency. Bitcoin is a currency like the Canadian dollar as in physical paper or coins. 
Compared to the physical paper currency, Bitcoin is a million times better in efficiency, easability, scalability, and convenience.
As for cards, it will come to Bitcoin in time. It's merely an interface issue.

What point are you trying to make; all you have done is just fallaciously and incoherently attacked Bitcoin. 
Yes 1200.00 price was a result of the 120.00 Bitcoin bubbling up to unsustainable prices before readjusting to sustainable prices. Bitcoin, however, has kept its value with minor fluctuations for the past 6 months which implies *market maturity.*

Slightly misleading.
1) Bitcoin was also worth 120$ 1 year ago, implying 4x the USD volume today. 
2) Bitcoin was also prone to massive, large swings in value (bubbles) 1 year ago, implying market maturity today.
3) The ~500$ Bitcoin today is just as sustainable as the ~100$ Bitcoin from a year ago.

Is this not the same as fiat? Keep in mind that most fiat consists of digital bits on the computer systems of banks. Why do they accept the bank's digital bits as wealth?
Sure bitcoin is relatively new and is not as widely accepted as fiat right now. But that's like complaining about the lack of gas stations in the early 20th century for your brand new car. Why not stick with horses instead? Why use airplanes when your destinations are limited, when ships and trains work just as good. 
That is how technology works. Technology succeeds if it's useful, if not it will fail. Bitcoin "digital bits" are very important. Borderless currency for an ever-globalizing world economy. Fast transactions. Cheap transactions. Efficient transactions. Flexibile currency. No political manipulation. No centralization. 
Physically mining for gold is just as useless as minting bitcoin. Printing fiat is even more useless, along with the millions of credit cards. Don't get me started with the waste of credit card advertisements you get from USPS.

Sure, volume was 10.4k BTC on Bitfinex yesterday with the CURRENT amount of Bitcoin traders/users. Are you implying that volume on Bitfinex will remain 10.4K if everyone adopted BTC? Is this the basis of your argument, that the amount of Bitcoin mined on September 9, 2014 was 40% of the total daily volume of the Bitfinex market? 
Sure, Bitcoin is not inflationary* in the short term; but as soon as demand (adoption) surpasses new supply; you *will* see a rise in price. But in the long term it is deflationary as: a) new supply halves every ~4 years. b) new supply is introduced at a fixed rate. c) there is a limit to total supply. 
None the less, I'm going to upvote you so that people learn from it.
Edit*: s/deflationary/inflationary

So basically you are proposing that we operate Bitcoin as a lame pyramid scheme, right? Raise the price by getting more users into the scheme and by buying more ourselves, as soon as the price hits an optimal value for the early investors; they can dump/spend at their will and crash the price again. And that poor sucker at the end of the chain loses, who cares right? That is not a healthy economy. How long do you think you can you keep this going? 
Instead, people should continue to spend Bitcoin at any price/value and quickly replenish their BTC their fiat. This stimulates the economy as a whole, and Bitcoin gradually raises in value as the network effect grows.
Don't be too concerned with price/value. It is inevitable that it will rise eventually, because its simply just a better product than fiat. We should be more concerned by stimulating the economy and that is by buying/selling with BTC; primarily buying because it creates incentives or demand for vendors/producers to sell in BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-22 08:11:18

Spending increases adoption, adoption is more important than conversion rates than to silly numbers with $ symbols attached to them.
Don't listen to this fool. Bitcoin is a currency, not an investment vehicle. 
If you had half a brain mate, you would suggest that people immediately rebuy the BTC that they spend to put buying pressure on the market. To balance it out. This is what I do by the way.
@_date: 2014-09-27 19:40:17
Are you saying that banks will not exist with Bitcoin? I don't think you fully understand what Bitcoin is, Bitcoin is not against banks, it is against fiat currencies. It is a new, better form of currency compared to fiat.
This is a very silly idea that people tend falsely believe, that Bitcoin banks will not exist. Bitcoin banks will exist, to some extent it can be argued that Coinbase is a Bitcoin bank.

While Circle did not *fix* volatility, it is in fact *fixing* it; just as Bitpay and Coinbase and every other other large Bitcoin payment processors are. 
As the network effect of Bitcoin grows and gets adopted, and as the Bitcoin ecosystem and infrastructure continues to be developed, volatility will be a thing of the past. Bitcoin volatility is not an inherent issue of Bitcoin itself, it is a result of a small ecosystem and userbase.

This myth is widely used by people who like inflation. What you're referring to is *hyper*-deflation. 
Similarly to how inflation today is not really noticeable in everyday transactions, deflation can and will work in the same manner. Lets say deflation was at 3%. If you NEED to buy a computer today, you are not going to wait until next year to buy it at 3% the cost. Thats just silly. 
Yes, bitcoin is unstable at the moment because the ecosystem is just so small. With less participants in the economy, it is prone to large swings. As it gets more and more adopted, and the number of participants grows; it will be more resilient to these swings in value that we see today.
tl;dr: Hyper deflation is NOT deflation, it in no way defines deflation; just as HYPER inflation does not define inflation.
