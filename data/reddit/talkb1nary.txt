If i remember right, and we are talking about the same, it failed because he just spawned virtual machines on a dedicated box with limited bandwidth.
Those limits were met very fast.

It is really not the worst idea. But all the articles seem to focus way to hard on the coin around Gems. While there is really a need for a good social media network / chat client with privacy and security in mind, they dont seem to try to patch that hole.

@_date: 2014-09-25 17:13:42
hm. maybe we talk about something different after all, i think i remember this and he actually used something similiar than i said, maybe just one hoster but still.
The Problem i see here is the second year. If you really spawn a new node after each 20$ who pays for the 200 nodes when the money for them is gone.
But maybe its not that stupid after all. If you make clear that you spawn/despawn nodes on a monthly budget based on monthly donations or something. Most VPS services have 1 month contracts.
@_date: 2014-09-25 13:57:23
yeah i liked the idea aswell. My idea would be to have several hosters with a similiar price range offering VPS boxes and rotate on them so you most likely will land on different dedi boxes each purchase.
Like using the popular services like DigitalOcean, Edis and similiar and then just average the price so the user wouldnt see a difference.
But that would be like $60 a year. Not 20.
Another thought on this is that the Network is already way stronger than needed (atleast i assume that, because my node doesnt nearly use as much traffic than it would be possible.)
edit:// please someone make this? I dont have the time for that :3

If you take only bitcoin, and believe in bitcoin, why do you even bother to reference the price in $ and make complicated BTC values out of it?

Even if the US shuts down Bitcoin, why would the rest of the world even care? Its not that the US would somehow control if i have a Bitcoin node or not. What do i care about what the US wants me to do?
And sure, the price would fall for a bit. But thats it.

I dont even care about ads that much as adblock does his job very well. But if you want me to use your chat/social network you need to provide me detailed specs about which encryption is used and where the data is handled.
All they give me is "Secure. Be as anonymous as you desire. Communications are always encrypted." practically the same WhatsApp told us when they launched. Still it was cracked not only once in a very short amount of time. They dont changed their whole encryption to the Textsecure system because they knew what they were doing.

I dont want to be that asshole, but why does the half of the community always again cry when apple removes something from the market? If you have an iphone i have to assume you did know that apple removes apps like they want to since it was that way since the beginning. If you didnt know that, just give it back and buy a different phone. I also dont get MS Office on my Android, its normal that each OS has some limitations.
Just ranting because every other post is about this story today.
* If i am a AAA gamer i dont install Linux on my desktop. 
* If i am someone who always races with his car i dont buy a smart. 
* If i like to wear exclusively green shirts, i dont buy pink ones.
* If i like to drink a coffee just now i wont drink a tea
* If i want to easily copy paste my MP3s i dont buy an iPod
* If i want to manage my music exclusively with itunes i would buy an iPod
* _If i like cryptocurrency i dont buy an iphone._

Hi there! I looked at your site and noticed that you could improve your seo and social appearance. I may add a few suggestions and btw i like that concept and i would love to see it growing!
* Texts generally. I know it is often hard to imagine a proper text that is not just repeating the obvious, but i would strongly suggest to have more texts on your website. I would most likely add one of those Icon/text things to the startsite [like i did here]( In that way you can a) make straight points what your site is about b) add keywords to your startsite.
* Metatags. I noticed you have no metatags for seo at all. While i agree that those are not needed on sites like news sites with a lot of text content. It could really help to let search engines understand what you are even doing. I would also add keywords like "buy music with btc" "sell music with bitcoins" and therelike.
* More details on the albums. I can see that this is a bit repetitive as you can easily listen to the music. But i still would like to see some categorisations and some descriptions about the Band/Album. What again would do wonders for your seo and if you happen to grow at some point categorisation would be necessary any way.
* Also i would add some shema.org and social tags. Add [Twitter Cards]( and [og:tags]( to the albums so sharing them would be more effective and converting (also for your personal twitter stream) and a [Schema.org itemscope]( will help search engines to understand what kind of data they are dealing with.
* Finally you could trying pushing your project by doing ads. I am thinking about promoted tweets and facebook ads (targeted to people who do music or buy _indie_ music online and like cryptocurrency). Putting just a few $ into this could already show you if it is even worth it, i say it is always worth the try. Also facebook generally tends to help getting found if done right. I dont like it as well, but you could just do the same like with your twitter and manage both at once with for example [Buffer](
Edit:// I see you already tried ads. So you may just ignore that part.
@_date: 2014-11-19 14:23:44
Ok, if people would start to accept bitcoin but have no idea how they work this could indeed give a problem. We arent that far in europe yet, atleast not in switzerland. But point taken.

i see your name, but why do you assume he wants to do that anon?
Also yes you actually feed it with a pre-generated address pool. Atleast thats the way that was intended for bitcoin payment.
But all of this is not really necessary as there is BitPay and others with varius plugins for known shopping plattforms.

This is like most people here see it actually. The "make it dont get lower than €1.20 per swiss frank" was a stupid idea to begin with. It was clear the european economy wouldnt grow but just loose in worth for the next few years, there was no way this €1.20 could be ever again be removed without making a disaster like this.
This said, most people i talked to about that today actually find it cool and interesting. As most of us work in the service sector that mostly sells because of "swiss label" other than a good price we can just appreciate the now even cheaper holidays and internet shops.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:31:02

I dont think this has much to do with bitcoin at this point. When a better technologie comes along that could save you a lot of money in the long term you have to look into it. Thats the only economical thing to do.

this is true, i am not running a node atm because i am not interested in monitoring it all the time. But it does barely run 3 days without my ram beeing full or it using 100% CPU for a few hours straight.
Btw it does have 2048MB RAM, and 1 dedicated core from a Intel Xeon W3520. That should be enough...
I would have the resources, but this behaviour let me question it.

I am with you. We have "Bitcoin", very unique. We have "a Satoshi" which was not only kind of unique but also a needed tribute. But i cant and wont accept bits. 
I work in IT, i could associate 1 bit at best with 1 satoshi, but everything else simply does not make sense to me. A bit is the smallest possible amount of Information, a bit in usual english also usually means a very small amount. 
Really which * had that great idea?

With legit marketing emails i guess you mean proper, super available, whitelisted email servers? The world biggest provider gets you [12'000 mails free]( a month.
And spam, not really surprisingly, usually gets send over common email hosters like Gmail, Yahoo and Outlook. So also pay nothing.
You are right that you pay for big newsletter lists, but in most cases  you just pay for the tools not for the emails itself.

I did not know that actually. The last time i heard from WoW was basically that blizzard was worried about them loosing to many customers. Good for them.

[Not anymore, decreasing pretty fast]( Anyway, i lost more friends trough WoW than trough Heroin and other drugs together. Sure most of them come back after some years, other than the dead drugs users, but nothing has been the same anymore. They even have fall-backs as often as the heroin fuckers. I for myself tried it at least 3 times and found it rather boring, what else should my attitude be?
Next to that Blizzard is the worst and would not care about their customers anyway, so why not do something productive from the beginning?
@_date: 2015-03-05 15:15:40

I know you are right, but i hate you for this. Then again, all your americans bastards are the same as well.
Next to that, OP could have used any country and it would be kind of ok in this means. But especially switzerland has nothing to do with the EU banking system at all. IMHO the dollar has more influence on this than the swiss franks. We are still independent

I am actually really afraid that some _guro_ takes this codebase it hides the fact that what is beyond trough some smart CSS.
Some points that made me shutter:
* No license
* Intentation like you used 10 different editors
* No real error catching
* Typos everywhere
That is basically when i stopped looking at the code.
Anyway, i was in a similar situation like you. I've build a great Bitcoin based software (a casino that was actually nearly done), was planning to release it as service and later as open source software. But i realized that most of it would be a stupid idea. 
We talk about money here. I've run several mining pools and in that time i've experienced attacks like i've never seen before. Sure fail2ban and cloudflare could help in most cases, but i got in a state where i was always paranoid how my servers are doing. And a pool usually only holds a relative small amount. A exchange on the other side... It would be profitable very fast to hack those.
So i wrote a casino software with best practices according to the bitcoin devs and nobody ever used it.
My point is. Take it as learning experience, and please mark it on your Github as it. If you are serious about it, keep in mind that this should be a professional operation and this code without atleast one security auditing is practically worthless.
Edit:// That (removing everything) was not my intention. Having stuff like this on your github is nothing bad. But marking it at what it is, is important.

nice to hear :) and yeah i am pretty sure you are right. Linux was always there, always stable, always awesome. But now it comes that it gets really easy too. 
If you ask around in my family everybody will call Ubuntu "the most easy OS" because they just have to plug new hardware in and it works and if they need software they usually just have to open the Software center. If i would have intruduced them 10 years before i would have gone crazy by all the support i had made for them to get simple things to work, now they usually get it working theirself.
You get that M$? **Its easy now!** way easier to find options and shutdown buttons than on your current experimental OS thingy.
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:05:08
this is the point, and yeah its not perfect at all (as no OS should tell it is) but it improves very fast and brings a lot of features under the hood. Next to this, believe me when i say i am no fan of ubuntu but i like how easy it is for newbies.
@_date: 2013-09-29 16:59:56

Do you know whats going on in windows? Do you know what all those million lines of code actually really do? Who tells you that Microsoft wont tell any govs as soon as you would have to pay taxes on BTC? Is there anything in that system, or around it that makes you trust Microsoft? But you trust them to "host" your BTCs?
Next to that, a working AV doesnt always work. I would believe most of the written viruses and trojans are not detected yet, never was one of mine but i also didnt spread them. But technically if i would spread them, they would be undetected for atleast a few hours (I actually expect a lot more). Not that i could not do that for linux, but it would be way harder to deploy and spread.
Also the huge market of exploits. For sure you can buy them for linux too but mostly they are way to specific to versions of software that you could use them widely. An 0-day for windows can usually be used on atleast 50% of all currently running desktops.
So in my eyes, there has to be one big exploit in the wrong hands and 99% of BTC users on Windows are poor. On the other side if that would happen to linux it usually would get a very specific target, like that one company or that one old ubuntu version which has this and this bug. 
Also, Windows user are used to use Software which they download randomly on the Internet. I have no idea why people would download firefox over download.com or something like this, but they do. If you are not that stupid you are safe from that kind of stuff. But for others, which most not that tech savyy people are, there are usually &gt;100 programms they downloaded and started once, never touched it again but still running in the background that could everytime load malware, or even contain malware already.
Again not that different on any other System, but atleast i can tell the not tech-people to use the "Ubuntu Software Center" and please ask for everything else they want to install. I usually wont get asked because most of the stuff is already there. Checked by people i have atleast a little trust in.
That said, yes i am kinda paranoid, yes i am an OS phanatic and yes i would not save private passwords or even personal pictures on a windows pc when i would not also want them to be all over the internet. For me its like asking if i would trust the U.S or the Nazis, no, sooner or later they would shit me anyways.
