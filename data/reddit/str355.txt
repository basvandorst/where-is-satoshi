It's all speculation, noone here knows. But, for the most part, people waiting for dips loose out on profit. My advice is to buy now, no more than you are willing to loose, remember to spend responsibly. I still think bitcoin has a long way to go before reaching the top. HODL and win

I know that, but when I got the receipt before I made the transaction to confirm, it gave me a price of ~11200€. I find it hard to believe that the coinbase price dropped almost 2k more without the charts even showing it. This is all so weird. I'm still in the green, so overall I should be happy, but there is something weird going on

I'm removing all my crypto from coinbase after this. The last BCH sale that occurred as I'm writing this was for 8300 USD? Are you guys seeing this shit? Coinbase has way to much power and influence, and can NOT be trusted anymore

As I said, it was to secure some profits. You sound very confident, and I actually believe you are right, but I wanted to move my money out of such a volatile market for some peace of mind, just to see where this is going from a safe place

Why do all moms use a space between the end of the sentence and the exclamation mark ? It's so frustrating !

That would make the bitcoin market cap larger than the entire world economy. Not possible

The coinbase app showed 8400 for almost an hour

Use a wallet that supports it. Plenty of them, just Google it

English isn't my first language, I know what "loose" means, as in a loose thread etc, but it's easy to mix the two when you don't really think about it

The best is to transfer it to gdax, sell it there and buy BTC. The easiest is to sell on coinbase and pay the $4 fee

I get it, but a difference of almost €2K is way too much to write off

Ouch. We are all suffering together boys. Maybe this will put a truce in the crypto civil-war going on, so we can focus on what matters. Winning, together. Through perseverance shall we be victorious

I was charged $1.99 in fees on coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:55:21
Really? Its a whopping 462% in dollars, funny how that works
