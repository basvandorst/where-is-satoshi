DONT DO IT THE TRANSACTION FEES ARE REDICULOUS! AND THE MINIMUM AMOUNT YOU HAVE TO BUY IS 0.02!!
USE BITSOURCE.ORG INSTEAD
@_date: 2014-08-02 02:24:40
Your telling me that you could have over 1 million dollars in btc right now if you didn't buy that fridge? Better have been a damn good fridge.
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:17:10
I would have been fine with losing that much but a minimum amount of btc you have to buy with no warnings? That is not right in my eyes.
@_date: 2014-05-31 04:51:57
10usd, but losing 20% of all that from trade fees is not reasonable.

@_date: 2014-05-31 02:26:07
dogecoin actually :P
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:23:08
Did you do the math for the hints? They only cost 0.005 btc and the 10 hints would cost 0.05 btc, then they can easily win. they should be a multiple so when they buy all the hints it wouldnt lead them to a profit at the end, change the price to 0.01 btc. :)
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:14:48
Sorry, I have never bought btc before in my life so I didn't know what was the best exchange to use :P
@_date: 2014-06-01 00:24:38
keeping them, I love crypto and feel it would be appropriate for my tech business.
@_date: 2014-06-27 17:42:52
dont worry, I heard that maybe a scam is going on. Maybe this guy will contact me thru messages :P
He wants and email and a bitcoin address, so I can easily create new ones lol.
@_date: 2014-06-27 17:43:27
He probably also wants me to follow a link or download a supposive .dat file lol
@_date: 2015-01-29 03:58:35
That was the address that send the email to my email. Not my actual email

@_date: 2015-07-01 18:23:32
good luck with that.
@_date: 2015-04-04 01:06:23
I bought in day one for that thing where you got btc for buying miners
I came out even in the end but I am transfering my funds off zenminer and into my dogecoin wallet now.
@_date: 2015-04-10 03:47:53
Yeah I'm sure now that the power for them is gone that they are gonna run with your money if you don't leave soob
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:36:09
My money isn't in paybase it's in zen miner which is an alternate company so I guess I am safe that's just where it is hosted I guess
