i am not an investor and have been using BTC for the last year or so to buy things and what not online. for me it is becoming to much of a hassle to use and with the increased fees its getting increasingly more annoying.
For me it just doesn't work anymore, i can not count on money i send anywhere to arrive in a timely fashion.

I do not even know what SW or LN means, lol.  I'm somewhat new to Bitcoin, I've only used it for about a year.  I do all my work online from home and a couple of my employers offered to pay me more if I took my pay in Bitcoin . That's what got me started into crypto currencies.
Lately I've even accepted litecoin and dodgecoin as payment for some free lance stuff.
I'm not an investor or someone who holds coins. I either transfer my coins directly to my bitpay card or I spend them online.  
At first it was cool and kind of a neat thing for me to learn how to use but honestly the recent changes are just making it so it isn't at all practical for me to use Bitcoin anymore.
I guess it is a neat thing if you want to invest money into it, but for someone like me who was only using Bitcoin for daily expenses and normal everyday purchases it is just becoming to expensive and inconvenient to use.
Yesterday I wasn't thinking and I sent a load to my bitpay card without checking and seeing what the current fee was.  So I sent my TX with a fee of 195 Satoshi per byte assuming it would be as sufficient as it was three days prior.
Well I was wrong and it took me 11 hours to get my funds.
I'm not knocking Bitcoin, it's just that since the price raise and the massive raise in TX fees it has simply raised the cost of using Bitcoin so much that it has lost its usefulness to a person like me. Not to mention the extremely long wait times on sending or receiving payments if you set your fee a little to low.

i use a lot of gpt/survey sites and i opt to receive about half of my pay in bitcoin. It used to be a good way for me to receive small payments between 5 and 25 dollars. last year the fees would just be a couple cents.
But in the last few months it has became very impractical to use Bitcoin for small payments. At least for me it has.

I use bitpay visa. It costs ten bucks for the card but after that there are no fees for loading BTC or spending your money. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 10:20:19
Oh I'm in the USA, here there are no kind of fees at all for loading BTC or spending it, also if I need cash I just do a Cashback purchase at the grocery store.
It does say there are fees if you do a bank transfer but I've never had a need for that.
So far I've had my card over a year and I paid the ten dollar fee for the card and that's it.
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:45:25
i use bitpay, it is nice. i can use it anywhere visa is accepted.

If you know much about gpt sites there are a few legit ones that pay in bitcoin .  You can find info on the different sites and methods over on the beermoney sub reddit.  I don't want to promote any individual sites here, but it's real easy to search within beermoney for bitcoin or sites that pay in bitcoin.

i was brand new to bitcoin a couple months ago and i also had a bad problem with coinbase. i was treated horribly by their support and basically told to bad so sad.
i had tried to use the instant paypal transfer feature and my money just disappeared.
coinbase said they sent it and that was that, they considered the matter closed. it was a few days later when i came to this forum and posted about my problem that a member of their support team reached out to me and fixed my problem in just a few hours time.
in my opinion that was probably the worst experience ive ever had with any type of money transferring or banking service. it was nice that i got my money back but the fact that i was originally told the matter was closed and there was nothing that could be done was awful customer service.
not to mention this, i was brand new to bitcoin and all i read tells me to be careful and protect my coin. so i was really turned off by the fact that their customer support wanted to handle my problem via reddit. 
i almost didnt even respond to their CS agent because i thought he was probably a fraud  or scammer of some sort. 
in the end i was treated very bad by coinbase then when i complained about it out loud on a public forum they decided to help me. i do not care to do business with any company that works that way. 
i just made a mycellium wallet and also ordered one of those bit pay visa cards. now if i need to cash any of my coin in i just use the top up feature on the bitpay card and it works great so far. it did cost 10$ to buy the bitpay card but after that there isnt a monthly fee or anything

They have been having troubles with every payment processor. I mean they will eventually always pay out but they can't be honest about problems within there site. 
My last payment took 28 days and there tos says 2 to 5 days max. I chose one of the methods they claimed they were not having troubles with.
I've used the site and others like it for a couple years now. The thing is that there are a few other sites that already pay out in bitcoin and will pay me within 24 hours.
I'll try to find you the clixsense forum link from last year where they not only told us they would never use bitcoin but they made fun of us for asking about it and told us basically only idiots would use BTC and any site paying in btc could not be trusted.
I love how they have changed their tune.
@_date: 2017-01-27 05:34:14
When I first got into BTC I was using coinbase.  I used the instant transfer to PayPal feature also.  I never got my money so I complained. After two weeks and coinbase telling me this was not their concern, it was between me and paypal.  I posted here in this forum, within three days someone from coinbase contacted me and got me my money back.
I'll never use coinbase again, they suck.  The fact I had to complain publicly to get help tells me all I need to know about there company.

If I received my items and had a receipt I could copy and show I paid for them then I wouldn't care one way or another.
@_date: 2016-09-13 10:04:19
Yes I have the confirmation they sent saying the transaction had been completed.  The thing is that PayPal never received the payment.
I have provided coinbase and PayPal all the relevant information regarding this transaction.
I don't plan on posting any proof on a public forum, I don't see how that would benefit me in any way
@_date: 2016-09-09 19:37:46
Well it's been over 24 hours for me, PayPal says they have no idea what could be wrong. Coinbase hasn't responded to me yet. I hope someone figures this out because as it is I'm out over a weeks pay, close to 900$
Thank you all very very much for the fast answers

How would it help me in any way to share my emails with the Reddit Community ??    I  have already told what was said to me in the emails.   I didn't come here to attempt to prove anything to anyone. 
I came here to ask if anyone knew a way to fix my problem.
@_date: 2016-09-14 17:19:16
Well I woke up this morning and I received my money sometime in the night.  I think it's awful that I had to come to Reddit and post about my problem before I got results.
I was originally told they considered this matter closed and it was PayPal's fault.  But after posting here they somehow were able to fix the problem and actually send my money.
@_date: 2016-09-14 03:25:01
I have sent you an email regarding the issue.  I hope you can fix the problem.  I'll be honest I find it very unprofessional that I was basically ignored through coinbase support but then when I come and post in a public forum that someone decides it may be time to help me.
@_date: 2016-09-13 09:23:14
They were recommended to me by an employer of mine. I recently picked up a couple jobs I've been turning down for a long time because they only paid in bitcoin.  I didn't realize that coinbase would just take my money and say, oh well.
Looks like I'm done with bit coin
@_date: 2016-09-05 07:20:39
Coinbase works fine for me. I've not had a problem yet changing coin to dollars
@_date: 2016-09-13 10:01:08
I have and they have not responded. They told me that they completed the transaction and nthey considered the matter closed
@_date: 2016-09-09 19:46:11
I hope you get this fixed. I am in the same situation. Coinbase is telling me it must be PayPal's problem and PayPal's saying it's coinbase problem
@_date: 2016-09-13 08:30:42
I transfered my bitcoin directly from my coinbase account to my PayPal account that is attached to my coinbase.  I did not use any middle man what so ever. I used coinbases transfer feature just like I always do.
Did you actually read my post ??

Here is the tx 
@_date: 2017-05-05 06:04:18
Oh, it was about 18 hours ago when I did it, does it generally take that long?
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:10:47
I tried this with a stuck tx, it didn't help any as far as I can tell. I mean the tx is still unconfirmed. I assume I did it right.  I entered the tx number and did the captcha and it said tx accelerated.

If Fiat currencies were to fall I don't see how crypto currencies could possibly hold there value. I mean my first thought goes to the reliability of the internet, just how long would the internet stay up and running without companies paying employees in Fiat currency?
If the internet were to go down then cryptos wouldn't hold any value, would they?
This is just me thinking out loud.
Also we have all seen what the recent price hikes have done to the Bitcoin network lately. Just imagine the time TXS would take if something drastic happened like a major countries Fiat falling. I would think the network would be unusable, or the fees would rise so high no one could afford using it.
You have to realize that if Fiat falls then all the folks saying they would be using Bitcoin would go from saving there BTC to using it for day to day TXS. Just imagine all the extra TXS that would add a day.
