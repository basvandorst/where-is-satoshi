Will the bitcoin sites ever be able to be stable? bitcoin.de is acting up again. If you can't get to your money for hours on end then that is quite a major shortcoming.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:44:55
Sorry. Really. Hadn't seen that.
@_date: 2013-04-04 10:08:19
I swear, I didn't intend this to be about getting anything. Just a little late night frustration, because I read about this stuff years ago and never predicted what was about to happen.
If you feel better, your generosity has gotten to someone like minded:
[1]( (No payment accepted)
[2]( (Lost big on that one, but who cares?)

This is true, but investing only 5 dollars at the very beginning would have been a near zero risk to most people. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 12:50:42
Doesn't matter, really. I see myself mor as a cosmopolit. I wouldn't even mind if you called me an italian.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:46:58
Lets just say, I could rather imagine LTC going from 5 Dollar to 20 than BTC going from 150 to 600.
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:30:29
I think you already invested wisely ;)
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:29:47
Do you think it would regain momentum after a burst bubble?
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:11:08


It already is, isn't it? All I keep hearing is how people want to buy and sell bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-04 12:11:19
Maybe I should be happy that I didn't invest. I don't think I could sleep over having, and taking care of 200 Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:51:20
Make that 2 beers.
@_date: 2013-04-04 12:12:28
That's alright. I don't really feel much of a difference from being German. I'm from Austria and I think german culture is very much a big part of my country.

I don't understand that smiley but if you're trying to draw one half of a cocktail glass, you're out of luck. One glass, one straw, sir.

Yes, I'm kicking myself. Because I learned about this when I still had the money to buy some. At that point in time I started to save money for a SE Asia trip, but I had to take care of my mother , which set me back big time and then I started to just forget about Asia and moved on to buy some crap, because, if I'm working 60 hours a week in a hostile environtment, why not have something nice, right?
I could have bought a hundred BCS, which would be enough to send me on that trip now. But instead of that I'm now without a job and with no money. I don't know much about technical stuff so this was all too abstract to me, still is. 
So, yes. I'm currently holding a very short end of a stick, realizing that had I just reacted differently I'd be fulfilling a dream.
But it is what it is. Maybe there's another place and another time for us. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:58:38
But what about those who want to buy in now?
@_date: 2013-04-04 12:27:22
I sent a backup to my email, so I hope that should be fine. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:37:05
Why now? I'm dead tired. 
Price seems to be rising again (120 Euro) at bitcoin.de. I'll go for it and hope it won't get further down. 
Damn, site is lagging.
*Edit: Ah, thank god it went through. Goodnight everybody! Wake me if something happens*
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:48:42
Investing in companies seems to be a very complicated thing. Also something I probably can't do with a hundred bucks and not getting drowned in fees.
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:13:01
Explain please.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:32:54
Can I ask a question here? People make millions off of Bitcoin? Is it rising so fast? Is there a chart form beginning to now?
Is it too late to get in?
I mean I can't belief that so many people, normal internetfolks, mind you, will be getting rich off this.
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:54:33
Perfect post. Some people learned this by getting hit A LOT harder.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:47:59
Yet it's impossible to get orders through.
@_date: 2013-04-04 09:58:41
Holy Shit Balls, Mom! Thank you!
I swear I won't touch it!
I'm out of words...
@_date: 2013-11-29 10:38:43
Thank you for the quick answer, but I'm on a mac.
@_date: 2013-04-04 12:08:34
I was in germany once and we were struck by how friendly and helpful the people were. Hamburg is really beautiful. I love those red brick houses. 
Great spelling, you've got there.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:37:58
Me too. Of course the price drops mere hours after I bought my very first bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:03:01
Have you paid back the 30k yet? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:58:00
It's not justice. It's young people with poor job prospects or a low chance of ever getting enough out of work (money) for what they will have to put in (effort), trying their luck in a game that was dangled in front of them like a carrot. 
It's stupid, naive *and desperate*, but death is not what they should pay with. Where's the justice you are talking of?
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:04:09
You know how I, as a person without any money, feel right now?
Like someone without a shovel standing amongst gold diggers.
