i had the same issue with coinbase last week. submitted like 4 tickets for support with only auto replies coming from them. no help... eventually i was able to get a device auth email from them before the link expired after about 6 attempts.
the emails kept coming in, but like 6 hours later and expired. it was some bullshit... 
just keep trying. itll eventually work? lol
kind of a sad state for the coinbase it seems.

shipping info indicates otherwise. it seems as though its on rout to my house now

i really dont think im going to be able to keep it. im sure they will contact me asking for payment or for me to return the device. that is if they really shipped the single in the first place. we shall see.
