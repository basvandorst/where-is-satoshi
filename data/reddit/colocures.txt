Could you retake that pic just one more time without that pesky cat in the way... and please make sure I can see at least one full set of public + private keys!

It amazes me how many HUGE sites on the internet are utterly broken without javascript...

Unfortunately it's not just their wallet service, but their entire onion website, including the block explorer... constantly says "Quota exceeded" when you just try to view info about a btc tx or address.
It's pretty goddamn useless.

Requesting  (at least without js) results in a cloudflare captcha page that will NEVER be answerable, in my experience, so I don't try anymore.
Care to share their .onion link?

After she gets the BTC in her wallet, she has a few options, the most popular of which are:
1) Sign up at an exchange and get paid via bank xfer to her bank account
2) Go to a marketplace like localbitcoins.com and find a trader for cash (or any other way she'd like to get paid in Pesos)

Lots of sources aggregated into 1 rss feed/webpage.
I find the best written, most concise and clear, yet detailed and accurate articles come from Bitcoin Magazine.

1. I have heard about you, only from online bitcoin news sources like this subreddit.
2. I am not sure yet, though I'd love to find out, except...
3. Javascript is *REQUIRED* to even view your page, much less use your service no doubt.  This is a no go -- I don't allow that shit in my  browser!  Webmaster get your act together and write a page that gracefully degrades!  Not everyone on the internet wants to run whatever damn javascript you choose to throw at them every time.  Turn this crap off!  When a new customer comes to use your service and sees that they can't even get information about your service without turning their browsing session into a security nightmare, I think the cryptoheads who buy plenty of bitcoin will just go about their known, secure methods, even if they are not as convenient - just my opinion.  Sorry about the rant... non-JS heads feel my pain I know they do.
Not expecting a tip, but *Thanks* for your time!
