Incorrect. In this case they just require the Core nodes to change. The other 12% are fine and will simply follow the new chain automatically.
Jtoomim has spoken with the major miners in China and they *all* agree with a rise in the blocksize to 2-4mb.
In the event of a hard fork the important actors who use bitcoin for business will have upgraded well before the actual time of the fork. This is is a non-issue presented as some kind of terminal event. Plainly ignoring the fact that hard forks have been coordinated in 12 hours in the past when it was a true emergency.
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:46:48
Since you need it completely spelled out for you. 
If this development impasse is not salvaged before the 1mb blocksize is hit then we can expect a change in the economic incentives and structure of bitcoin. A complete change from the original bitcoin from 2009 - present day. 
Things users can look forward to: rising fees, transaction delays, inability to actually use the network at all with failed transactions.
Users do not like the above. Investors do not like the above. Businesses which are leveraged and funded based upon a growing ecosystem do not like the above. They will take their funds out of bitcoin and the exchange price will crater.
Irrelevent? Hilarious how wide of the mark you are.

What happened to 'let's have a truce?'
@_date: 2015-12-30 09:19:50
The reason people are talking about a change in the economics of bitcoin is because if the 1mb limit is not raised that is *exactly* what is about to occur. Saying anything else is frankly dishonest.
Since 2009 the network has responded to rising transactional demand by creating larger blocks and writing those transactions to the blockchain. Now for the first time in seven years after the 1mb maximum blocksize level is hit instead of that occurring we will get rising fees (see fee market), double spends (see RBF), congestion, delays to be included in a block and in some cases failure of transactions to make it into the chain despite paying what today would be considered acceptable fees.
The above is a sea change from the original vision of bitcoin. Worse it is a 'manufactured' change that the community, industry and miners to not want and did not ask for.
His ideas about consensus are also completely wrong and circular.
Sorry to say but this not balanced and reeks of a conflict of interest.
The market has begun to provide solutions to this in the form of other clients which are banned from discussion here. I suggest those interested check out the other places for more information.
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:41:25
On the one hand miners are incentivised to chase as many transactions/fees as possible by creating the biggest blocks possible. On the other if they mine blocks which are too big then they risk being orphaned.
There is no need for a fee market and in fact it completely distorts the original bitcoin vision.
@_date: 2015-12-01 20:30:51

Oh and having a quiet word in Theymos' ear to point out that banning everything he doesn't like is highly counterproductive.

The point is that there is no good reason why blocks should get full. 
No one really believes that 2mb blocks will behave any different to 1mb blocks.
@_date: 2015-12-01 20:41:42
BIP-101 has been running with 8mb blocks on testnet without major issue.
Every single Core developer knows bitcoin can safely scale up 10x from here - they just don't want it to because that prevents off chain solutions having a use for the next 3-5 years. The market wants bitcoin to scale and so magic will happen and another reference client which does will be chosen if Core doesn't step up. You can't fight the market.

He speaks for 99% of the user base regarding the max blocksize. We know that major exchanges, payment processors and coinbase support bigger blocks. Hell we even know the miners support bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 02:39:13
Why would anyone lose their coins? What mechanism exactly would explain that? Despite what you say a planned hard fork is a simple software upgrade that can be performed in days. 
Those people who fail to upgrade simply fall off the network. No drama, especially if you are running XT or BU as you are at no risk at all.
@_date: 2015-12-31 01:54:24
It has nothing to do with wealth and everything to do with hashing power. GG.
@_date: 2015-12-31 01:33:37
Who gives a shit what he thinks consensus is. 
Either Core increases the maximum blocksize (and there is 0 indication of that happening at the moment) or the network will hard fork to avoid a change in the balance of economic incentives which has successfully driven bitcoin for the last 7 years.
People aren't stupid. They realise that if it weren't for his employer we wouldn't be contemplating RBF or a fee market, or the prospect of full blocks with rising fees, congestion and transaction delays, and the possibility of failed fee paying transactions at a level that would have sufficed for the last year.
'Core developers' are going to learn what open source means and how powerless they are when they try to change the network in a way that the ecosystem disagrees with. No amount of censorship is going to change that.

It certainly isn't 'of course'.
There is absolutely no reason whatsoever why we need a fee market now. All that is required is the blocksize to rise and fees can remain low for the next few years.
Saying fees must rise is repeating an oft-told lie.

The effect of the halving is to slightly reduce supply of new coins. But tipping the scales of supply and demand tends to give rise to wild price swings with bitcoin. The imbalance may be less than before, but the outcome could still be far greater given easier off and on ramps and wider public awareness.

Yes, the point was that 'Core' devs have changed what was the original idea of network consensus to come up with a new definition which is 'whatever we decide'.
In the medium term they have just accelerated their own demise. We have multiple new competing implementations: BU, XT, bitpay and just today bitcoin classic.

On Core nodes that update to the latest release?
@_date: 2016-01-09 17:22:34
The basic and fundamental point is that raising the blocksize to 2mb or 4mb will not increase node centralisation significantly. So why not do it? And blaming a risky hard fork is not a valid reason given the network has previously hard forked in a few hours with no issues (except for a tiny loss of mining revenue).
@_date: 2016-01-09 16:40:05
The problem is that the small block side of the argument *are* trying to make a major change to the economics of bitcoin for the first time in 7 years of success.
They are literally locking in the blocksize and saying that if more people want to transact on the main chain they cannot. Worse they are openly trying to make transactions more expensive which goes entirely against the ethos of bitcoin that the majority of users and companies built in the space believe in.
The reason there is such a hullaballoo is because there is a complete and utter disconnect from the Core developer position (and a few hangers on here on and the rest of the entire ecosystem (including exchanges, payment processors, users, investors, wallet developers, miners etc..).

Programmer meet the real world outside your basement.
It will be fascinating to see how many of the 33% of nodes running the latest Core release bother to 'upgrade'.
Wouldn't it be amusing that it could be this change rather than the failure to increase the blocksize that is the straw that breaks the camel's back, and leads to the network deprecating Core for alternate installations which are not attacking bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 15:57:59

@_date: 2016-01-06 19:09:33
Yeah and it is working now as it has for the last 7 years.
You want to change the economics of bitcoin because: "fees gotta happen sometime."
Well actually as bitcoin is still a nascent currency with a very high block reward for at least the next 4 years, no, fees aren't required to rise soon.
The market abhors a situation like you are proposing - artificially increased fees, artificial fee 'market' within an artificial maximum blocksize cap. Consequently other bitcoin implementations will grow around Core.
Let's see how many of the 33% of the network running the last Core release agree with attacking 0-conf usability by running the latest release!

No what you would do is coopt the project 'at the core' and steer it into a niche market and keep it nicely contained and unable to mainstream for capacity or design reasons. 
Enter blockstream out of nowhere in the last 12 months. Suddenly bitcoin cannot scale. Suddenly 1mb block sizes forever and ridiculous contortions with overly complicated soft forks because suddenly bitcoin cannot hard fork and "consensus".

Most of the network stopped upgrading Core a long time ago. If the latest release featuring nuggets like opt-in RBF fails to be installed by a significant proportion of the network then Core has managed to deprecate itself to older versions already.

@_date: 2016-01-03 18:44:45
Great, but wrong entirely.
Demand is set by what the market can bear, not by artificial limitation. 
In your example you are limiting the number of hotdogs for sale to 200 (because reason) and the number of customers is rising year on year. For some reason you don't think that rising prices will lead to competition from another hot dog supplier.
@_date: 2016-01-03 16:26:04
And if one miner patches to accept RBF it requires a relay path from a rogue node to this rogue miner for the RBF transaction to propagate across the network and be confirmed by this one miner.
That seems unlikely to work. 
Furthermore, this argument is oft repeated by small block proponents as a reason why implementation on RBF in core is irrelevant because 'a miner can simply implement RBF' which fails entirely to address how these RBF transactions are relayed to said miner.
EDIT: downvote away! This subreddit is dead, frankly.
@_date: 2015-08-23 15:02:30
Let's be clear. Miners operate to receive the block reward. 
As soon as it becomes clear that a hard fork will happen then all miners will choose the new chain. In that short moment the new fork will become bitcoin and the old chain will become worthless.
This widely promulgated theoretical possibility that two bitcoin chains will exist or be in any way relevent is nonsensical scaremongering. Miners will not continue to mine a defunct chain because they will not be able to sell their mined coins for fiat currency.
As it becomes clear that 750 blocks are to be mined by XT then wallet providers, payment processors, exchanges will simply ensure they are ready to move over seamlessly.
@_date: 2015-08-02 12:39:34
Look around. The ecosystem doesn't care if you have 10,000 coins. A billion dollars of VC funding and 99% of the userbase and ecosystem want bitcoin to scale, either with Core or without it.

Bitcoin can remain the dominant blockchain in five years easily with careful stewardship. 
It is after all the only chain supporting significant speculative value with a mining network to withstand attack after six years of blockchain technology.
The worry for me is not that bitcoin is failing - it currently is the only success story in the space in terms of market capitalization. The fear is that bitcoin is crippled and could be superceded by a superior scalable alt blockchain competitor onto which migrates all the speculative value in the future.
If I were serious about taking bitcoin's crown I would develop a sidechain with a variable peg to bitcoin, perhaps driven by an algorithm which weighted 'early movers'. If it were backed by sufficient capital and was compatible with bitcoin miners it isn't hard to see bitcoin modifying itself into complete irrelevence if it continued down the path of being a 'settlement layer'.
it is hard to settle something if your tokens are worthless and everyone has moved to something else instead.

Considering the market cap of bitcoin right now and in the future we need companies in the bitcoin space to step up and fund Core or an alternative.
As it stands we have developers chasing $ working to actively cripple bitcoin in favour of a sidechain owned by their employer (blockstream).
These changes go against the wishes of the stakeholders in the bitcoin ecosystem.
Bitcoin should be allowed to scale and kept as cheap as possible for as long as possible.
@_date: 2015-08-02 12:44:28

Which ever chain has the support of wallets, exchanges and 3rd party payment providers will prevail, as long as a majority of nodes move over.
That is very likely to be the future proofed blocksize scaling fork.
The 'rump' blockchain will still exist whilst miners and nodes maintain it but as soon as it becomes clear that one side has economic value the other will become worthless instantly.
Because all parties know this then in practice once this drama plays out 'there will be only one'.

Thanks for your distraction.
I am sure the blockstream developers and team are very reasonable people. And noone is suggesting they are trying to destroy bitcoin, simply change the direction it is taking from being a layer-0 scaling peer to peer global cash, to being an expensive store of value and settlement layer for banks and fin tech companies.
If all they cared about was scaling bitcoin with lightning or another vapourware solution which does not exist, then they wouldn't be obstructing raising the blocksize limit above 1mb or introducing a market fee system literally years before it is needed. If they weren't crippling bitcoin for their own agenda then yeah we would be thanking them for their 'great work'.

If anyone wasn't clear about the direction the blockstream brigade want to take bitcoin then these steps light up the path.
Project change bitcoin into a settlement layer for blockstream to provide off chain high volume transactions. 
1) freeze the temporary blocksize at 1mb
2) introduce a fee market with no discussion with the bitcoin community
3) change the project from the inside (changing the documentation of bitcoin functionality, strengths and weaknesses, 'a transaction is a confirmation')
4) attack Satoshi openly on this forum
I think this coup d'etat will fail. But be clear that only one blockchain will remain after the upcoming fork and the community needs to make it clear which outcome they want to choose for bitcoin. 
Do you want bitcoin to be an expensive settlement layer for banks and fintech companies? Or do you want bitcoin to be a peer to peer internet cash for the world to use?
@_date: 2015-07-23 21:23:03
Absolutely. 
It is no coincidence the other developers who oppose lifting the restrictions of the 1mb blocksize limit all work for Blockstream.
@_date: 2015-07-23 06:36:04


When are we going to actually see some evidence that increasing the blocksize will reduce the number of nodes? So far it is just fear mongering.
@_date: 2015-07-23 06:40:35
Yeah and we await with baited breath to be shown any evidence that full node numbers will drop as the blocksize rises. 
Where is the evidence that I cannot continue to run my full node with blocksize scaling?

Why are you comparing raising the blocksize limit with raising the 21m limit?
@_date: 2015-09-04 19:50:47
I used to enjoy reading your posts on btc talk up until a few months ago when something changed in your tone. Disappointment about bitcoin from an economic perspective perhaps..

The biggest mistake Gavin made was relinquishing control of Core to you lot. 
Bitcoin has been in turmoil since and like it or not  projects need leaders - not dreamy eyed fantasies about programming by committee (or consensus).
And that is not even mentioning the gigantic conflict of interest you bear by working for blockstream.
You can do better!
@_date: 2015-09-02 18:27:14
You seem to be missing the bit where the majority of traffic moves off chain to lightning hubs, to not return. But the block reward keeps exponentially falling, along with mining income and eventually network security..
Get that?
@_date: 2015-09-02 22:09:01
Majority of transactions, not miners.
The question is: who maintains network security when miners lose the block reward and the vast majority of transaction fees disappear into off chain blockstream payment hubs. Who is paying miners to keep the network functional?
It is all hypothetical anyway because miners can remove the use case for Lightning network in the medium term by simply raising the blocksize.

@_date: 2015-09-06 19:58:45
Literally everything you said is flat wrong.
This place is going to dwindle in popularity rather quickly with this technical level of discourse..
@_date: 2015-09-02 08:56:55
Bitcoin could scale 10x higher from here trivially. 
At the same time the block reward schedule will continue for many years to come and offsets this requirement.
That said the small cohort of early adopters arguing for bitcoin to remain a settlement layer with high transaction fees will simply find they are voted into irrelevence by the miners who actually support the network.
Do ~~blockstream~~ Core developers honestly believe that given a choice between increasing the blocksize, with consequent room for larger numbers of cheaper transactions, that miners will willingly divert income to Lightning network hubs run by a private company?
The market will correct such hubris.
@_date: 2015-09-02 16:57:48
If that number allows bitcoin transaction to rise 100 or 1000x then I consider that scaling..
@_date: 2015-09-01 09:23:20
I'm surprised a poster of your calibre is going along with such rubbish, yes..

The sensible posters left when the censorship started..

Do we need to remind you yet again about censorship after the gentoo farce?
@_date: 2015-09-02 15:00:16


You won't see a response from the small block crowd on this issue. Just deafening silence and vague references to high on chain fees. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 15:17:41
You literally added nothing to this discussion.
It is entirely valid to raise the argument that the creator of the project, the designer of the blockchain, originally wished for bitcoin to scale. 
In fact he even predicted centralisation of nodes and mining. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 14:49:07


Changing a single number in the code sorts that problem. Same BS from you over and over..
Make up your mind, is it centralization that is the problem or is it the technicals? 
@_date: 2015-09-02 09:16:41
You lot are crazy.
@_date: 2015-09-02 14:54:07
Miners don't get paid for Lightning transactions.
This idea that they are going to willingly give up their future income stream to centralised payment hubs that keep all but power users off the main chain because they will be able to charge massive transaction fees is a little silly, especially when they can take everything (and keep everyone actually using bitcoin) by just increasing the blocksize a few orders of magnitude.
@_date: 2015-09-02 09:30:05
That post about 90% of the subscribers being free to leave if they don't agree with him is comedic tyrannical gold.
@_date: 2015-09-02 14:59:00
Why would miners quit when they can just change the network protocol to something that benefits their continued income?
If increasing the blocksize is beneficial to miners, you bet your life it will be increasing. 
The facts are that the block reward that pays miners is exponentially falling. Miners need income to compensate. It was satoshis vision that transaction fees would fill that void, not centralised off chain private payment hub solutions.
@_date: 2015-09-02 09:13:14
The block reward is exponentially reducing which each halving.  Combined transaction fees (as valued in fiat currency) must exponentially rise in order to simply maintain the network at present levels of security.
If the blocksize is artificially capped and the majority of transactions and new users migrate entirely off chain to Lightning hubs then transaction volume and fees on the main chain will actually decline.
Remember the fee market only leads to rising fees when blocks are filling up.
Or miners can simply decide to protect their own investment, protect the network and increase the blocksize regardless of what small cabal of developers for just one version of the bitcoin software thinks- which entirely negates the use case of Lightning for quite some time into the future..
