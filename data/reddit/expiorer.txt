Good point.
Same as BTC.

if Bcash blocks will get bigger and bigger and never be full, then most fees will be 0 or 1 satoshi per transaction (why pay more?). When miner rewards stop, Bcash centralization will do something terrible.

Nvidia should make mining rigs that are cheaper than video cards.

If it is a brainwallet, does it mean she owns my brain?

The article is based on wrong assumption that distributed LN is impossible (image 1). It seams the author thinks that maximum count of channels for node is one.
It is funny how much time he wasted.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:15:37
Someone should make a sticky post "Never buy paper/plastic wallets!"
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:17:43
How much will be one satoshi?
µBTC 0.01 or nBTC 10?
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:37:15
You will be able to maintain LN node and charge a little LN transaction fee. Even I will start a node when I get paid.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:12:35
No Bcash is not a developers group. Bcash is altcoin.  
But Bcash supporters often call Bitcoin Bitcoin Core. It would be much harder if we rename Core to Bitcore.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:09:16
LN will fix that
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:19:39
The second way is to put Bcash on railway to show that it is more centralized.

You have only one number. That is why You can not see.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:07:45
No this is a developers group for Bitcoin.

you should comment on the video

any capital will do. I hope someone makes a distro so I don't have to be expert (I am)

why music?
@_date: 2018-08-13 08:34:40
same as guessing your private key
@_date: 2018-08-29 09:33:50
don't forget to short it before the attack.
@_date: 2018-08-30 08:13:49
it failed when it needed to cheat POW algorithm, because nobody wanted to mine/buy it.
@_date: 2014-01-14 11:13:05
plus unknown = 55%
(yes, they can hide some % there)
@_date: 2014-09-01 04:09:54
it is not encrypted, just obfuscated
@_date: 2014-10-09 03:53:44
And bitcoin ATMs are unhackable?
@_date: 2014-01-14 11:49:59
and nobody will stop them
@_date: 2014-01-10 13:40:49
Did anyone find a solution?
I am sure that miners did not move to various unknown pools and nobody likes to mine solo eather.
@_date: 2014-01-14 11:19:05
because it is in their interests to be above 50%
@_date: 2014-01-27 12:50:44
are you sure?
could it be KH/s ?
@_date: 2014-06-06 08:48:54
Not possible to get any information if blur has some random stuff.
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:37:58
That is why I will stick to mining
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:35:11
I did, that is why I think nobody will detect my quantum miner.
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:29:59
That would be suspicious. And key cracking is harder than mining.
@_date: 2017-03-26 17:30:17
attracts a people attack.
@_date: 2017-03-19 08:34:57
Majority will stay on segwit, because it will be cheaper (lightning). That means BTU prices will drop much lower than BTC. Then miners will come back to BTC (more profit). And then BTU dies. 
So yeah! Fork it!

@_date: 2017-11-13 16:27:30
those are not photos. Look again.

even shitcoiners will not bother forking bcash
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:49:40
Better use open source Ublock Origin. Adblock sold out.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:17:21
Bcash is not Satoshy's vision. Bcash cheated with EDA to stay alive.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:30:23
Easy. Just start downvoting them. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:13:28
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:12:10
r/btc downvotes posts about scaling.
Because 1GB blocks (being tested) are ridiculous.

I am behind a heavy firewall. 
Can not see nodes and can not use proxy. 
Is there a way to wrap it in html protocol?

Add text "Garzik sucks" to core node info message.
May be they will not copy that :)
@_date: 2017-10-03 05:55:23
Lucky bastard. Now You have 10x more. LOL
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:36:21
What is it? Where can I read about it?
@_date: 2017-10-09 07:24:42
A corporate layer that You may avoid if You want.
S2X will be a mandatory corporate layer.
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:27:34
BCH please! You did not get the joke.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:48:20
It is spam. Ignore it.

not all miners are blind

@_date: 2017-06-22 17:08:46
at most?
@_date: 2018-12-11 06:46:10
If that magic iteration of some ALT happens (scales good without gigabyte blocks), Bitcoin can copy it.
@_date: 2013-10-24 09:09:09
So, what are you trying to say?
You think price will not go back up again?
Make a big title with that in your blog and never delete it.
So we will have a nice story to lough about later.
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:03:58
And why bitcoin foundation did not register first?
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:33:04
The price can not grow forever.
It will stabilize when amount grows big enough.
And the hash rate will stabilize too.
So stop worrying.
@_date: 2013-10-23 08:08:47
just use some android phone and put its memory card in a safe.
@_date: 2013-10-19 06:24:23
Phone app is cheaper than special hardware wallet.
Just keep the phone allways offline and nobody will steal from it EVER. 
And of course protect it with password and keep a copy on some memory card.
