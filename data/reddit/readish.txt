That's the exact same thing people said when it hit ATH $1 in 2009, then $10, then $100, now over $7,000 and will continue to say at $10,000, $100,000...﻿and so on. Bitcoin growth is not linear, it's exponential.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:45:45
 [Math/probability]( and [history]( indicate that price will continue to rise (we may see a flash dip/crash, but good luck catching it on time).

You are making a mistaken comparison. This is the difference: Bitcoin is Not like the portion of the DotCom companies that imploded (centralized entities), Bitcoin is like the Internet (decentralized technology of exponential growth that gets stronger every day).
Everybody parroting: "[The bitcoin bubble is about to pop]( since 2009, don't know that bitcoin is a decentralized system with mathematically fixed, deflationary and limited supply currency and its growth is [exponential]( not linear. 








































 ________________________________
When you get a glimpse at the big picture, you will come to realize that Bitcoin at less than $100,000 is still undervalued.
Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.
If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to "ban" it.
Check out this great articles: 
* What Gave Bitcoin Its Value?
 
 
 
* "How do Bitcoins have value?"
 
 
Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). "Backed by Government" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.
**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**
* Very cheap regardless of amount $$$ sent (with new apps coming)
* Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)
* Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
* Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
* Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)
* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
* Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
* Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
* Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
*And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.*

It's also fun to analyze and expose the coordinated "strategy" they are pulling off from many fronts. And don't forget the incoming fork they are doing to adjust the EDA to continue the disruptions. We should not just ignore all those moves, since we can learn a lot from studying what's goin on, so we are ever more prepared for the next times.

The comments there, still "Bubble", "Not backed by anything", "Ponzi/Pyramid Scheme", etc. demonstrates that we are still at a very early stage, far from mainstream and from the vertical on the 'S-Curve', it shows that the current price is far from a "bubble". Maybe it will be a bubble when it hits 6 digits, but not now.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:43:55
No, this overconfidence is dangerous, S2X is not dead, not by a long shot, the objective here isn't profit, but to destroy decentralized threats their central power and control. [These]( are just their frontmen. If you think this is a crazy conspiracy theory, learn [who is funding]( the attack. Never underestimate those guys.

I don't agree, the voting system works fine and normally (not on ATH's) only the relevant or funny memes make it to the higher positions.
 I like serious discussions but, at the same time, I enjoy the pictures/memes, they are not just funny but also a powerful tool to convey spontaneous and creative ideas/desires that sometimes take Bitcoin straight to the collective consciousness by making it to the front page of Reddit. Like the recent [Tesla]( one, or the [All-Time  posted just yesterday (it brings awareness about Bitcoin's rising value to the collective in a funny way).
Or like [this one]( that I made, that shows how a lot of people is feeling the same way and it is a fair thing to ask/wish for, and also triggers some serious discussion and clarification of misinformation in the comments section 
TL;DR: If you don't like some post from a legit poster, just downvote and move on. In case of trolls/bots/brigades, also report them to the Mods.
Edit: Added some links.

 [Moneybadger didn't give a fork]( And now the dip is over, there were tons of people waiting on the sidelines to buy and they are finally diving in once the uncertainty is removed. The exodus to altcoins from the speculators [it's done]( from almost $8000 to all the way down to almost $7000. Now, it's all the way up, even if it is slowly. Don't expect $6000 coins, we are going to $10000.

Not true, all OB1 team has been out there shamelessly promoting and defending tooth and nail the S2X/NYA attack. This [post]( contains  some evidence of that, also all you guys post history.

Nobody, no individual and no central power or government can control, manipulate, ban, hack or kill a worldwide distributed open-source peer-to-peer cryptographically secured decentralised system. Bitcoins will continue to increase in value, more than gold and silver, there will only be 21 million bitcoins ever, they are cryptographically and mathematically secured, it is decentralized, so can't be banned, co-opted or confiscated/stolen by any central group or government, you hold your own private keys. The future economy is digital and decentralized.﻿

Till the bcash dump starts, as always. Better sell pumped bcash (expensive) for depressed BTC (cheap) at this time. Bcash has no future for many reasons, but this is the most important to point out and easier to understand: It is a centralized altcoin, controlled and manipulated by a few unethical and non-technical indivuduals. They have money to pump and they have tools to deceive like Bitcoin.com and r/btc, and other stuff named after the real Bitcoin.
So this is my message to Roger:
Please re-name your website, your altcoin, your subreddit, your news-site, etc. to something different than Bitcoin. You decided to fork-off, go play with your toys and stop pretending you and all your stuff belong to the Bitcoin community. Stop using fraudulently the Bitcoin name and stop deceiving newcomers that are buying a knock-off coin thinking they've got the real Bitcoin.
Edit: Added my message to Roger.

Yes, also what most people don't get yet is  that  Bitcoin's growth is not linear, but exponential, just like the Internet was since de 90's. We are at a very early stage and we haven't even hit the bottom part of the vertical on the 'S-Curve' of technology adoption.
And regarding all the FUD being spread around the coming fork, nobody knows what will happen,  but  this is what [happened on the last fork]( after many upvoted posts and comments here predicted a post-fork crash followed by a bear market.

 Let's enter the appropriate review for the Bitcoin.com site here:
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:08:05
That assessment is missing the fact that Bitcoin is growing exponentially. Every dip get's bought fast by newcomers and other people that were piling for a dip. Also, we haven't even hit the bottom of the "S-Curve" of adoption/growth and institutional money hasn't yet started to pour in. So, the price at $10,000 is still very cheap for this 'digital gold' of very scarce supply (and wait for the next 'halving').
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:05:04
Edit: [Guys, please take a few minutes to leave an appropriate review for the scam site Bitcoin.com](
Correct, for all the people saying that this is not a big deal, "just ignore them" read this to see why we can't remain passive:
 Under no circumstances we should underestimate Roger, Jihan, Barry Silbert, McAffee, Craig Wright, Belsche, Pair, Ayre, Buterin, Bobby Lee and the like. They can't destroy Bitcoin, but they can do a lot of damage and they are scamming thousands of newbies who know no better.  
They don't just have huge mining power and billions of dollars at their disposal, they can multiply that power many times by the use of troll farms and mainly, the use of the *** website. They have also *** and ***r/btc.*** 
All of those tools/sites are promoting/advertising Bcash as the "real"  Bitcoin. That's straightforward fraud and should not be allowed because they are harming a lot of newbies, anyone entering the game deserve to start on a level playing field and be provided with truthful and unbiased information so they can make informed decisions.
Meanwhile, they continue milking the Bcash cow, and thousands of newbies keep buying his cowshit.
Hell, they even give him gold when he openly lies to them and scams them in broad r/btc daylight (third link), here's some evidence of their scammy and shady behavior:












































* 






























 Edit: There is a massive brigading in this and the other related threads by bcash trolls right now (I have them tagged).
Edit 2: Ok guys, I'll stop here, feel free to continue adding to the list, I don't have infinite time, and the more I dig the more I'm convinced Roger's shady/shitty/unethical/fraudulent/scammy/stupid/psychopathic/narcissistic/megalomaniac/etc. actions are unlimited. I don't hate Roger and his accomplices, I just wish for his actions to be exposed so thousand of newbies would stop falling victims of that organized scam cartel.

 &gt; Here's Bitcoin's [response]( to Jamie Dimon. Stick to the [real Bitcoin]( through all the ['forks' and 'splits']( that accomplish nothing but new mediocre, unsafe and centralized altcoins, [strengthen/immunize](  Bitcoin and give you free altcoins to buy more Bitcoin.


 &gt; All [Central Powers look silly]( trying to [control]( or [ban]( it. Learn from [history]( and listen to this [absolute Boss]( There will never be enough Bitcoin for every existing millionaire to own just ONE SINGLE BITCOIN, [Total number of millionaires (in USD value) worldwide is around 33 million]( BTC is the [best money](

 &gt; &gt; Everybody parroting: "[The bitcoin bubble is about to pop]( since 2009, don't know that bitcoin is a decentralized system with mathematically fixed, deflationary and limited supply currency and its growth is [exponential]( not linear. When they bring up the overused "2000 Dotcom Bubble collapse" argument, tell them: [I hope so!](




 &gt; &gt;  So is not farfetched to say that it will be at 100,000 by 2020,  since it came from less than $1 to $5,000 in less than 10 years, and it hasn't even hit the bottom part of the exponential ['S-Curve' of adoption]

[Guys, please take a few minutes to leave an appropriate review for the scam site Bitcoin.com](
Bcash has no future for many reasons, but this is the most important to point out and easier to understand: It is a centralized altcoin with a few crappy devs, controlled and manipulated by a few rich unethical and non-technical individuals and some Chinese miners.
For all the people saying that this is not a big deal, "just ignore them" read this to see why we can't remain passive:
 Under no circumstances we should underestimate Roger, Jihan, Barry Silbert, McAffee, Craig Wright, Belsche, Pair, Ayre, Buterin, Bobby Lee and the like. They can't destroy Bitcoin, but they can do a lot of damage and they are scamming thousands of newbies who know no better.  
They don't just have huge mining power and billions of dollars at their disposal, they can multiply that power many times by the use of troll farms and mainly, the use of the *** website. They have also *** and ***r/btc.*** 
All of those tools/sites are promoting/advertising Bcash as the "real"  Bitcoin. That's straightforward fraud and should not be allowed because they are harming a lot of newbies, anyone entering the game deserve to start on a level playing field and be provided with truthful and unbiased information so they can make informed decisions.
Meanwhile, they continue milking the Bcash cow, and thousands of newbies keep buying his cowshit.
Hell, they even give him gold when he openly lies to them and scams them in broad r/btc daylight (third link), here's some evidence of their scammy and shady behavior:

This is why there is a large transactions backlog (apart from Bitpay and other anti-bitcoin companies refusing to implement Segwit):
The miners leave to mine  b-*ash because it is more profitable, and that is due to the messed up  b-*ash EDA system. This shady and disruptive difficulty adjustment shenanigans are combined with other strategies like 'spam attacks', mining empty blocks, etc. But they will switch back in two days, as they always do when BTC is more profitable:
Source: 
Also there's the coordinated b-*ash pump:




The pumping was mostly from Korea, again, with more than 60% (abnormal) volume of  b-*ash trading coming from there, combined with coordinated Bcash "supporters" brigades in social media.
We don't know how long this pump will last, but there's nothing real to justify a $1,000 price for  b-*ash even for a medium term. Some of us wish it would last till January 1st, when Coinbase will release hundreds of thousands of  b-*ash coins, most of which will be dumped for BTC.

This post is just FUD, OP is completely ignoring that Bitcoin growth is not linear, but exponential, just like the Internet was since de 90's. We are at a very early stage and OP is also ignoring that we haven't even hit the bottom part of the vertical on the 'S-Curve' of technology adoption.
There is no way to have a MtGox sized crash because the situation now is indeed different, with dozens of regulated and legitimate exchanges. Not even stocks like Google and Apply can fit on OP's "Boom &amp; Bust" model, since they keep growing (with minor dips) as the adoption of their services grow. Bitcoin will continue to grow in an exponential way and the price will continue to follow accordingly.

Roger was promoting Bitcoin, it made him rich since he is an early adopter. Now, blinded by greed for more money and power, he created his own altcoin and is deceiving people. Bcash is just a badly coded centralized altcoin at its best and a Roger Ver's one of many scams at its worst. He has Bitcoin.com and a lot of money to keep pumping that altcoin and keep committing fraud by making newcomers think they are getting the real Bitcoin, when they are getting instead a fake product.

@_date: 2017-11-25 06:58:44


If they short Bitcoin, they will get destroyed. Don't break one of the basics rules of Bitcoin: 


People try to make the "shorting FUD" argument because they've been able to manipulate gold, silver, fiat and other centralized assets (centralized because the issue the fractional-reserved paper fiat and equally fractional-leveraged paper commodities contracts) they could do the same with Bitcoin, but it's not the same, they control gold/silver/fiat/etc by flooding the markets with fake units (fractional-reserved paper contracts/fiat not backed by any real asset 1:1),  they sell/dump tons of gold in paper, triggering massive amount of 'margin-calls' and create a domino effect producing a downward spiral  (till they stop it when they start buying back cheap fake/pretend paper gold).
That game is played as if 'paper contract'=physical gold. They can't play that game with Bitcoin, they can't pretend a 'paper contract'=Bitcoin, that would never work. If they dump 'paper Bitcoin' (fake bitcoin), real Bitcoin's price wouldn't be affected. 
Bitcoin is transparently and accurately accounted for on the Blockchain, they can't leverage real Bitcoin 100:1 or more, like they do with gold and fiat, with just paper gold and printed to infinity fiat, they do it because of centralization, because they control those assets, but they don't control Bitcoin. 
To leverage Bitcoin in a way that would impact the market/price, they would need first to buy the real thing and take a very real risk of losing their pants if they short it.
TL;DR: Decentralized vs Centralized markets, they can't manipulate/'fractional-reserve' Bitcoin.
Edit: Added meme.

Bcash has no future for many reasons, but this is the most important to point out and easier to understand: It is a centralized altcoin with a few crappy devs, controlled and manipulated by a few rich unethical and non-technical individuals and some Chinese miners.
 Under no circumstances we should underestimate Roger, Jihan, Barry Silbert, McAffee, Craig Wright, Belsche, Pair, Ayre, Buterin, Bobby Lee and the like. They can't destroy Bitcoin, but they can do a lot of damage and they are scamming thousands of newbies who know no better.

  [Moneybadger didn't give a fork]( And now the dip is over, there were tons of people waiting on the sidelines to buy and they are finally diving in once the uncertainty is removed. The exodus to altcoins from the speculators [it's done]( from almost $8000 to all the way down to almost $7000. Now, it's all the way up, even if it is slowly.
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:45:09
Short [answer]( Moneybadger don't care.
Long answer:
Nobody, no individual and no central power or government can control, manipulate, ban, hack or kill a worldwide distributed open-source peer-to-peer cryptographically secured decentralised system. Bitcoins will continue to increase in value, more than gold and silver, there will only be 21 million bitcoins ever, they are cryptographically and mathematically secured, it is decentralized, so can't be banned, co-opted or confiscated/stolen by any central group or government, you hold your own private keys. The future economy is digital and decentralized.﻿

1) The vast majority of Bitcoiners are planning to dump S2X for BTC as soon as they can, so it will probably look just [like last fork](
2) The math you need to do is what you think B2X will be worth. For instance, say BTC is worth $7500 at the fork with B2X worth $2000. This means BTC has to fall to less than $5500 for you to lose money. A 26%+ drop in literally an hour? Not impossible but not probable (credit to u/SsurebreC).
3) The wave of people planning to sell BTC post-fork because are expecting a dip/correction/crash will get canceled-out by the wave of people waiting to buy BTC post-fork for the exact same reasons (last time, the second group was larger and the price skyrocketed).

When you get a glimpse at the big picture, you will come to realize that Bitcoin at less than $100,000 is still undervalued.
Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.
If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to "ban" it.
Check out this great articles: 
* What Gave Bitcoin Its Value?
 
 
 
* "How do Bitcoins have value?"
 
 
Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). "Backed by Government" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.
**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**
* Very cheap regardless of amount $$$ sent (with new apps coming)
* Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)
* Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
* Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
* Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)
* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
* Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
* Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
* Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
*And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.*

For the new people here, you are never late for the Bitcoin party, this is just barely starting, we are at the stage the internet was in the 90's.  Here are some info and resources (at the bottom) to get you started:

 &gt; Here's Bitcoin's [response]( to Jamie Dimon. Stick to the [real Bitcoin]( through all the ['forks' and 'splits']( that accomplish nothing but new mediocre, unsafe and centralized altcoins, [strengthen/immunize](  Bitcoin and give you free altcoins to buy more Bitcoin.


 &gt; All [Central Powers look silly]( trying to [control]( or [ban]( it. Learn from [history]( and listen to this [absolute Boss]( There will never be enough Bitcoin for every existing millionaire to own just ONE SINGLE BITCOIN, [Total number of millionaires (in USD value) worldwide is around 33 million]( BTC is the [best money](
 &gt; 
 &gt; Also relax, you are actually an [early adopter]( BTC is still [relatively small](  [mentally prepare]( yourself for healthy and expected market volatility/dips/corrections/"crashes" (check out this amazing ['Corrections Trends Perspective']( and remember all this:


 &gt; &gt; **Follow this basic rules of Bitcoin**:


 


 




 &gt; &gt; Everybody parroting: "[The bitcoin bubble is about to pop]( since 2009, don't know that bitcoin is a decentralized system with mathematically fixed, deflationary and limited supply currency and its growth is [exponential]( not linear. When they bring up the overused "2000 Dotcom Bubble collapse" argument, tell them: [I hope so!](




 &gt; &gt;  So is not farfetched to say that it will be at 100,000 by 2020,  since it came from less than $1 to $5,000 in less than 10 years, and it hasn't even hit the bottom part of the exponential ['S-Curve' of adoption]

 &gt; &gt; Also, remember its [fixed, limited supply of 21 million coins ever,]( there are just ~4.5 million (~20%)  bitcoins left to be mined till 2140 and the production will keep decreasing ("halving") every [4 years till then](  So, remember [this]( and [don't wait for the Bitcoin "bubble" to burst]( or for the price to drop significantly again, because you could be waiting forever:

If they short Bitcoin, they will get destroyed. Don't break one of the basic rules of Bitcoin: 


People try to make the "shorting FUD" argument because they've been able to manipulate gold, silver, fiat and other centralized assets (centralized because the issue the fractional-reserved paper fiat and equally fractional-leveraged paper commodities contracts) they could do the same with Bitcoin, but it's not the same, they control gold/silver/fiat/etc by flooding the markets with fake units (fractional-reserved paper contracts/fiat not backed by any real asset 1:1),  they sell/dump tons of gold in paper, triggering massive amount of 'margin-calls' and create a domino effect producing a downward spiral (till they stop it when they start buying back cheap fake/pretend paper gold).
That game is played as if 'paper contract'=physical gold. They can't play that game with Bitcoin, they can't pretend a 'paper contract'=Bitcoin, that would never work. If they dump 'paper Bitcoin' (fake bitcoin), real Bitcoin's price wouldn't be affected. 
Bitcoin is transparently and accurately accounted for on the Blockchain, they can't leverage real Bitcoin 100:1 or more, like they do with gold and fiat, with just paper gold and printed to infinity fiat, they do it because of centralization, because they control those assets, but they don't control Bitcoin. 
To leverage Bitcoin in a way that would impact the market/price, they would need first to buy the real thing and take a very real risk of losing their pants if they short it.
TL;DR: Decentralized vs Centralized markets, they can't manipulate/'fractional-reserve' Bitcoin.

**We do care**, and we should till the day of the fork.
Don't get complacent just because the price is going up, we have a serious attack coming that will compound with a coordination with an additional Bcash planned fork at the same time.
Daily reminder till the day of the fork-attack: Please use a tiny bit of your profits and help to protect the Bitcoin network by running a full core node.
 Contact your Bitcoin companies supporting the S2X/NYA Trojan horse and tell them that you support Bitcoin and not a corporate centralized coin despite having &gt;80% of the centralized miner's support.

These attacks are great opportunities for those waiting for a low entry point to buy Bitcoin. Buy now, and if it goes lower, buy more (I don't think it's going below $6000).
The bclone dump will come, as always. Better sell pumped bclone (expensive) for depressed BTC (cheap) at this time. Bcash has no future for many reasons, but this is the most important to point out and easier to understand: It is a centralized altcoin, controlled and manipulated by a few unethical and non-technical individuals. They have money to pump and they have tools to deceive like Bitcoin.com and r/btc, and other stuff named after the real Bitcoin.

Stick to Bitcoin, the alts will make you lose money. Also, do not daily trade, that will also most probably put you under water unless you are an expert trader AND an expert on cryptocurrencies markets and ecosystem.
So just do this: **Buy Bitcoin and Hodl!**
Since Bitcoin's inception in 2009, that has been proven the best, simpler, profitable and more efficient strategy.
Edit: Ok, maybe also a little bit of Litecoin, Monero, Ripple, Ethereum, Dash and Zcash. Do not fall for 'Bitcoin Cash' (Bcash/BCH), that is a scammy centralized artificially-pumped altcoin.

Do not disclose that to anybody. Just tell her that you will talk to her about some legal investments on some internet stuff that you've been doing well, with the condition she doesn't ask questions. If she really loves you, she will respect your privacy and will trust in you, and also will be very happy because you will be using some of that money to improve your lives, maybe she can stop working while she calmly finds something she really likes doing, give a large down payment on the house, pay for a nice family vacation, take her out to nice restaurants, etc. You will be using just a small amount of your stash and she will be very happy with that (again, if she is a good woman and she loves you).

Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.
If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to "ban" it.
Check out this great articles: 
What Gave Bitcoin Its Value?
"How do Bitcoins have value?"
Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). "Backed by Government" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.
**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**
* Very cheap regardless of amount $$$ sent (with new apps coming)
* Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)
* Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
* Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
* Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)
* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
* Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
* Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
* Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
*And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.*

...zoom... out.
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:39:01


Just like the Internet was in the 90's. 2nd layer scaling apps are being implemented, no need to rush anything that would risk Bitcoin's main attributes (core values): Antifragility, Decentralization, Uncensorability and Immutability. For now, it is already very valuable as the best store of value available, better than gold.
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:03:31
Agree, public pressure works when your profits depend on your reputation. The social media criticism worked for companies like Open Bazaar, which after weeks of calling them out on their S2X support, they finally [withdrew it](
Please contact the companies on these lists if you have any type of relationship with them, we have less than 2 weeks left till the fork:

You can't compare MtGox times with the present state of Bitcoin. Volatility is ever decreasing and even with major hacks, failures, bans, forks and FUD (Bitfinex, Polloniex, China, Bcash, S2X, Dimon) remains stronger than ever. Bitcoin is immutable and Antifragile.
So, no, don't expect crashes of that magnitude. We will just experience short-lived dips and corrections. Bitcoin growth is exponential, not linear.






 &gt; &gt;  So is not farfetched to say that it will be at 100,000 by 2020,  since it came from less than $1 to $5,000 in less than 10 years, and it hasn't even hit the bottom part of the exponential ['S-Curve' of adoption]

We can't remain "neutral" anymore, every company and individual needs to be clear whether they support the attack or they are against it, whether they stand with a bunch of [rich crooks]( trying to gain more power, control and centralization or they stand with the Bitcoin community.
Keep the pressure on the companies still supporting the attack, we have only one week left. We may not prevent the fork from happening, but we can isolate the companies and individuals who sold their reputation and credibility for a potential bigger profit.

Buy before the fork:
* 1) Otherwise you would miss out on the free money: You get one S2X coin for every BTC you have at the time of the fork. 
 
* 2) The vast majority of Bitcoiners are planning to dump S2X for BTC as soon as they can, so it will probably look just [like last fork](
 
* 3) The math you need to do is what you think B2X will be worth. For instance, say BTC is worth $7500 at the fork with B2X worth $2000. This means BTC has to fall to less than $5500 for you to lose money. A 26%+ drop in literally an hour? Not impossible but not probable (credit to u/SsurebreC).
 
* 4) The wave of people planning to sell BTC post-fork because are expecting a dip/correction/crash will get canceled-out by the wave of people waiting to buy BTC post-fork for the exact same reasons (last time, the second group was larger and the price skyrocketed).

That's the exact same thing people said when it hit ATH $1 in 2009, then $10, then $100, now over $7,000 and will continue to say at $10,000, $100,000...﻿and so on. Bitcoin growth is not linear, it's exponential.

 &gt; &gt;  So is not farfetched to say that it will be at 100,000 by 2020,  since it came from less than $1 to $5,000 in less than 10 years, and it hasn't even hit the bottom part of the exponential ['S-Curve' of adoption]

1) The vast majority of Bitcoiners are planning to dump S2X for BTC as soon as they can, so it will probably look just [like last fork](
2) The math you need to do is what you think B2X will be worth. For instance, say BTC is worth $7500 at the fork with B2X worth $2000. This means BTC has to fall to less than $5500 for you to lose money. A 26%+ drop in literally an hour? Not impossible but not probable (credit to u/SsurebreC).
3) The wave of people planning to sell BTC post-fork because are expecting a dip/correction/crash will get canceled-out by the wave of people waiting to buy BTC post-fork for the exact same reasons (last time, the second group was larger and the price skyrocketed).
So yes, nobody knows what will happen, but stop assuming with great confidence that *most likely* will be a dip/correction/crash post-fork.

That's the rational and safe stance, I hope the fuckers at Coinbase, Gemini, BTCC, Xapo, BitPay, etc. change their plan of naming  BTC the chain with the most hash, that stupid stance is giving the centralized Chinese miners power to decide what coin is Bitcoin.

He continues to promote and advertise his scam coin as the "real" Bitcoin, and we are doing nothing about it. We need to call them out in all social media, sometimes it works.

Stick to the real, decentralized Bitcoin. Bcash has no future for many reasons, but this is the most important to point out and easier to understand: It is a centralized altcoin with a few crappy devs, controlled and manipulated by a few rich unethical and non-technical individuals and some Chinese miners. They have money to pump and they have tools to deceive like Bitcoin-com(fake site, the real Bitcoin website is Bitcoin.org) and r/btc (fake bitcoin forum, the real one is r/bitcoin), NewsBitcoin-com, Bitcoin-com Wallet and other fake stuff named after the real Bitcoin.﻿

Bcash will get wrecked. And Coinbase will give their customers their Bcash on January 1st, they claim to hold around 10% of Bitcoins in existence, so many hundreds of thousands of Bcash will be dumped then, to buy BTC. But by then, they may be worthless. Please Coinbase, do it earlier, so we can get more than a few dollars for every bcash coin.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:06:09
Only good thing is that we get to dump those coins at a higher price in January when Coinbase releases our bcash.
Edit: Spelling.

Correct, also:
1) The vast majority of Bitcoiners are planning to dump S2X for BTC as soon as they can, so it will probably look just [like last fork](
2) The math you need to do is what you think B2X will be worth. For instance, say BTC is worth $7500 at the fork with B2X worth $2000. This means BTC has to fall to less than $5500 for you to lose money. A 26%+ drop in literally an hour? Not impossible but not probable (credit to u/SsurebreC).

Anyway, we should not dismiss or underestimate [them]( just because they are laying low. Let's keep the pressure on the companies still supporting the attack, public pressure works when your profits depend on your reputation. The social media criticism worked for companies like Open Bazaar, which after weeks of calling them out on their S2X support, they finally [withdrew it](
Please contact the companies on these lists if you have any type of relationship with them, we have less than 2 weeks left till the fork:

@_date: 2017-11-01 16:02:20
Yes, we need that, it's just for the few days remaining till the fork, so I can stop "spamming" information to make people aware of what the S2X/NYA attack really is and who is funding it (a surprisingly amount of bitcoiners are still in the dark about it).
Also, please use a tiny bit of your profits and help to protect the Bitcoin network by running a full core node.
 Contact your Bitcoin companies supporting the S2X/NYA [Trojan horse](    and tell them that you support Bitcoin and not a corporate centralized coin despite having &gt;80% of the centralized miner's support. 
Don't get complacent just because the price is going up, this is a serious attack that will compound with a coordination with an additional Bcash planned fork at the same time.

Edit: [Guys, please take a few minutes to leave an appropriate review for the scam site Bitcoin.com](
Correct, for all the people saying that this is not a big deal, "just ignore them" read this to see why we can't remain passive:
 Under no circumstances we should underestimate Roger, Jihan, Barry Silbert, McAffee, Craig Wright, Belsche, Pair, Ayre, Buterin, Bobby Lee and the like. They can't destroy Bitcoin, but they can do a lot of damage and they are scamming thousands of newbies who know no better.  
They don't just have huge mining power and billions of dollars at their disposal, they can multiply that power many times by the use of troll farms and mainly, the use of the *** website. They have also *** and ***r/btc.*** 
All of those tools/sites are promoting/advertising Bcash as the "real"  Bitcoin. That's straightforward fraud and should not be allowed because they are harming a lot of newbies, anyone entering the game deserve to start on a level playing field and be provided with truthful and unbiased information so they can make informed decisions.
Meanwhile, they continue milking the Bcash cow, and thousands of newbies keep buying his cowshit.
Hell, they even give him gold when he openly lies to them and scams them in broad r/btc daylight (third link), here's some evidence of their scammy and shady behavior:

 Edit: There is a massive brigading in this and the other related threads by bcash trolls right now (I have them tagged).

No, the Streisand effect happens when you are caught trying to hide a scam/fraud/lie, not when you want to expose one, when there's some info that you don't want to go out/spread, something you want to suppress, in this case we want the opposite, we want this info to be spread as wide as possible.

Some of us don't operate on fear, when others interpret something as 'scary' we see it as exciting! Just like two guys riding together the same Roller Coaster: The first guy is holding on to the bar for dear life and eyes shut, fearful. While the second guy, right beside him,  is wildly enjoying the ride, eyes wide open, and arms thrown out in the air, fully embracing the experience. When the ride is over, the first guy quickly gets off,  dramatically kisses the floor, vomits and swears to never do it again. The second guy says: "One more time!...PLEASE!!"...
It is your choice how you interpret anything, everything in the universe contains both the positive and negative polarities.

Bcash will get wrecked. And Coinbase will give their customers their Bcash on January 1st, they claim to hold around 10% of Bitcoins in existence, so many hundreds of thousands of Bcash will be dumped then, to buy BTC. But by then, they may be worthless. Please Coinbase, do it earlier, so we can get more than a few dollars for every bcash coin.
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:03:11




That's because outside of [these crooks]( &gt;99% of the Bitcoin community knows which one is the real Bitcoin, all the forked coins are altcoins, they are not 'bitcoins' by any means (other than the fake label, of course).
But we should not be complacent because the S2X attack has [Big Money]( funding it.

Not the same, they control gold by flooding the markets with fake gold (paper gold contracts),  they sell/dump tons of gold in paper. 
That game is played as if 'paper contract'=physical gold. They can't play that game with Bitcoin, they can't pretend a 'paper contract'=Bitcoin, that would never work. If they dump 'paper Bitcoin' (fake bitcoin), real Bitcoin's price wouldn't be affected. 
Bitcoin is transparently and accurately accounted for on the Blockchain, they can't leverage real Bitcoin 100:1 or more, like they do with gold and fiat, with just paper gold and printed to infinity fiat, they do it because of centralization, because they control those assets, but they don't control Bitcoin. 
To leverage Bitcoin in a way that would impact the market/price, they would need first to buy the real thing and take a very real risk of losing their pants if they short it.
TL;DR: They can't 'fractional-reserve' Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-16 20:13:36
When you get a glimpse at the big picture, you will come to realize that Bitcoin at less than $100,000 is still undervalued.
Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.
If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to "ban" it.
Check out this great articles: 
* What Gave Bitcoin Its Value?
 
 
 
* "How do Bitcoins have value?"
 
 
Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). "Backed by Government" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.
**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**
* Very cheap regardless of amount $$$ sent (with new apps coming)
* Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)
* Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
* Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
* Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)
* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
* Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
* Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
* Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
*And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.* 
Bitcoin keeps going on stronger than ever and [its development is growing fast]( Core developers are working really hard and efficiently. Check out this great summary by John Newbery:












































































Scaling is coming, ignore the FUD. **The most important thing for Bitcoin now is for its main chain to keep its main attributes: Antifragility and Immutability**, that's what gives it the status as a safe store of value. To use it to buy a cup of coffee it's not a priority  (but we will get there later), just like the Internet, built on a solid base and adding all the needed and desired functionalities with second layer apps.
 Also, Note the massive amount of qualified devs working on Bitcoin and those second layer apps vs the few crappy devs on the roger-coin. Which project do you think has more value in the medium and long term?

These attacks are great opportunities for those waiting for a low entry point to buy Bitcoin. Buy now, and if it goes lower, buy more (I don't think it's going below $6000).
The bclone dump will come, as always. Better sell pumped bclone (expensive) for depressed BTC (cheap) at this time. Bcash has no future for many reasons, but this is the most important to point out and easier to understand: It is a centralized altcoin, controlled and manipulated by a few unethical and non-technical individuals. They have money to pump and they have tools to deceive like Bitcoin.com and r/btc, and other stuff named after the real Bitcoin.
So, this is my message to Roger:
Please re-name your website, your altcoin, your subreddit, your news-site, etc. to something different than Bitcoin.

Stop using fraudulently the Bitcoin name and stop deceiving newcomers that are buying a knock-off coin thinking they've got the real Bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.
If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to "ban" it.
Check out this great articles: 
* What Gave Bitcoin Its Value?
 
 
 
* "How do Bitcoins have value?"
 
 
Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). "Backed by Government" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.
**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**
* Very cheap regardless of amount $$$ sent (with new apps coming)
* Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)
* Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
* Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
* Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)
* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
* Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
* Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
* Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
*And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.* 
Bcash has no future for many reasons, but this is the most important to point out and easier to understand: It is a centralized altcoin with a few crappy devs, controlled and manipulated by a few rich unethical and non-technical individuals and some Chinese miners. They have money to pump and they have tools to deceive like Bitcoin.com and r/btc, and other stuff named after the real Bitcoin.
So, this is my message to Roger (u/MemoryDealers):
Please re-name your website, your altcoin, your subreddit, your news-site, etc. to something different than Bitcoin. You decided to fork-off, go play with your toys and stop pretending you and all your stuff belong to the Bitcoin community. Stop using fraudulently the Bitcoin name and stop deceiving newcomers that are buying a knock-off coin thinking they've got the real Bitcoin.

Expensive? One whole bitcoin at $10,000 USD is dirt cheap. In a decade you will wish you had bought one when it was just at $50,000. Regarding "slow", that will get fixed with 2nd layer apps, just like the Internet did.

If there is no dip/correction post-fork, when people see nothing happened, that Moneybadger don't give a fuck, then, we don't go to the moon from there... we go to uranus! ;) so you will get fucked if you are shorting Bitcoin, as we can assume by your prediction that it will "brutally crash".

For the new people here, you are never late for the Bitcoin party, this is just barely starting, we are at the stage the internet was in the 90's.  Here are some info and resources (at the bottom) to get you started:




 &gt; ) in [FUD times](




 &gt; Here's Bitcoin's [response]( to Jamie Dimon. Stick to the [real Bitcoin]( through all the ['forks' and 'splits']( that accomplish nothing but new mediocre, unsafe and centralized altcoins, [strengthen/immunize](  Bitcoin and give you free altcoins to buy more Bitcoin.


 &gt; All [Central Powers look silly]( trying to [control]( or [ban]( it. Learn from [history]( and listen to this [absolute Boss]( There will never be enough Bitcoin for every existing millionaire to own just ONE SINGLE BITCOIN, [Total number of millionaires (in USD value) worldwide is around 33 million]( BTC is the [best money](
 &gt; 
 &gt; Also relax, you are actually an [early adopter]( BTC is still [relatively small](  [mentally prepare]( yourself for healthy and expected market volatility/dips/corrections/"crashes" (check out this amazing ['Corrections Trends Perspective']( and remember all this:


 &gt; &gt; **Follow this basic rules of Bitcoin**:


 


 




 &gt; &gt; Everybody parroting: "[The bitcoin bubble is about to pop]( since 2009, don't know that bitcoin is a decentralized system with mathematically fixed, deflationary and limited supply currency and its growth is [exponential]( not linear. When they bring up the overused "2000 Dotcom Bubble collapse" argument, tell them: [I hope so!]( Look at these [past decentralized  tech adoption "bubbles"](




 &gt; &gt;  So is not farfetched to say that it will be at 100,000 by 2020,  since it came from less than $1 to $5,000 in less than 10 years, and it hasn't even hit the bottom part of the exponential ['S-Curve' of adoption]

 &gt; &gt; Bitcoin has outperformed every other currency, commodity, stock and asset since its inception in 2009: ["2017: Bitcoin Beats Stocks, Bonds, And Gold, Again”](
 &gt; &gt;  Bitcoin, the [Moneybadger]( is the first unseizable store of value in human history, unlike gold, equities, or fiat, it can't be confiscated if stored correctly. How banks think [blockchain will disrupt their industry]( Check out these Bitcoin [Economy]( and Bitcoin [Transaction]( infographics.




 &gt; &gt; Also, remember its [fixed, limited supply of 21 million coins ever,]( there are just ~4.5 million (~20%)  bitcoins left to be mined till 2140 and the production will keep decreasing ("halving") every [4 years till then](  So, remember [this]( and [don't wait for the Bitcoin "bubble" to burst]( or for the price to drop significantly again, because you could be waiting forever:

We can do both at the same time, they are not mutually exclusive.


Then are you against exposing software bugs, frauds, scams and all things we should be aware of to make Bitcoin better? Should you ignore an abscess growing in your finger and not seek medical attention just because "it will not kill me"?
Also, do not underestimate Roger, Jihan, McAffee, Craig Wright, Belsche, Pair, Ayre, and the like. They can't destroy Bitcoin, but they can do a lot of damage and they are scamming thousands of newbies who know no better.  
They don't just have huge mining power and billions of dollars at their disposal, they can multiply that power many times by the use of troll farms and mainly, the use of the *** website. They have also *** and ***r/btc.*** All of those tools pretending to be the real Bitcoin. That's straightforward fraud and should not be allowed because they are harming a lot of newbies, anyone entering the game deserve to start on a level playing field and be provided with truthful and unbiased information so they can make informed decisions.

That's the point, they have to BUY FIRST 100 million, the price would skyrocket  first, so I don't care if they cause a crash from $20,000 to $15,000. Anyway, that won't be allowed, and the volume will be much higher, thus, reducing volatility, see this latest talk by Andreas (who is an advisor the the CME Bitcoin futures), he explains why volatility will decrease, very interesting:

 ________________________________
When you get a glimpse at the big picture, you will come to realize that Bitcoin at less than $100,000 is still undervalued.
Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.

Bitcoin keeps going on stronger than ever and [its development is growing fast]( Core developers are working really hard and efficiently. Check out this great summary by John Newbery:












































































Scaling is coming, ignore the FUD. **The most important thing for Bitcoin now is for its main chain to keep its main attributes: Antifragility and Immutability**, that's what gives it the status as a safe store of value. To use it to buy a cup of coffee it's not a priority  (but we will get there later), just like the Internet, built on a solid base and adding all the needed and desired functionalities with second layer apps.

This is why there is a large transactions backlog (apart from Bitpay and other anti-bitcoin companies refusing to implement Segwit):
The miners leave to mine  b-*ash because it is more profitable, and that is due to the messed up  b-*ash EDA system. This shady and disruptive difficulty adjustment shenanigans are combined with other strategies like 'spam attacks', mining empty blocks, etc. But they will switch back in two days, as they always do when BTC is more profitable:
Source: 
Also there's the coordinated b-*ash pump:




The pumping was mostly from Korea, again, with more than 60% (abnormal) volume of  b-*ash trading coming from there, combined with coordinated Bcash "supporters" brigades in social media.
We don't know how long this pump will last, but there's nothing real to justify a $1,000 price for  b-*ash even for a medium term. Some of us wish it would last till January 1st, when Coinbase will release hundreds of thousands of  b-*ash coins, most of which will be dumped for BTC.

@_date: 2017-11-07 12:28:41


1) The vast majority of Bitcoiners are planning to dump S2X for BTC as soon as they can, so it will probably look just [like last fork](
2) The math you need to do is what you think B2X will be worth. For instance, say BTC is worth $7500 at the fork with B2X worth $2000. This means BTC has to fall to less than $5500 for you to lose money. A 26%+ drop in literally an hour? Not impossible but not probable (credit to u/SsurebreC).
3) The wave of people planning to sell BTC post-fork because are expecting a dip/correction/crash will get canceled-out by the wave of people waiting to buy BTC post-fork for the exact same reasons (last time, the second group was larger and the price skyrocketed).
Nobody knows what will really happen, but stop assuming with great confidence that *most likely* will be a dip/correction/crash soon.

S2X has no real value, it's a poorly coded pumped attack funded by [the central control powers]( that want to prevent decentralized freedoms. It has no network (other than fake nodes), no developers (other than the disgraced Garzik), no community support (other than the individuals and companies they have bribed/threatened).

Korean exchanges have '0' fees, just like Chinese before regulations (and dropped &gt;95% after regulations), so you move the same money back and forth thousands of times, artificially creating high volumes, that's just one tool those scammers use to manipulate the markets.
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:44:40
Is not a scam, when uninformed people just viscerally and reflectively spout to this day: "Bubble!!", "Tulips!!", "Ponzi/Pyramid!!", "Too late to buy!!", etc. that's the exact same thing people said when it hit ATH $1 in 2009, then $10, then $100, now over $7,000 and will continue to say at $10,000, $100,000...﻿and so on. Bitcoin growth is not linear, it's exponential.
Everybody parroting: "The bitcoin bubble is about to pop" since 2009, don't know that bitcoin is a decentralized system with mathematically fixed, deflatioary and limited supply currency and its growth is [exponential]( 
 
  So is not farfetched to say that it will be at 100,000 by 2020,  since it came from less than $1 to $7,000 in less than 10 years, and it hasn't even hit the bottom part of the exponential ['S-Curve' of adoption]

3)There are assholes everywhere that just want more power and money, that is a fact, these ones are no different, and there's nothing wrong with calling them out.

Bcash will get wrecked. And Coinbase will give their customers their Bcash on January 1st, they claim to hold around 10% of Bitcoins in existence, so many hundreds of thousands of Bcash will be dumped then, to buy BTC. But by then, they may be worthless. Please Coinbase, do it earlier, so we can get more than a few dollars for every bcash coin.

Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than Google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible into smaller units). "Backed by Government" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.
**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**
* Very cheap regardless of amount $$$ sent (with new apps coming)
* Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)
* Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
* Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
* Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)
* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
* Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
* Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
* Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
*And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.* 
Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.
If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to "ban" it.

Great post! Yes, when uninformed people just viscerally and reflectively spout to this day: "Bubble!!", "Tulips!!", "Ponzi/Pyramid!!", "Too late to buy!!", etc. that's the exact same thing people said when it hit ATH $1 in 2009, then $10, then $100, now over $7,000 and will continue to say at $10,000, $100,000...﻿and so on. Bitcoin growth is not linear, it's exponential.
Everybody parroting: "The bitcoin bubble is about to pop" since 2009, don't know that bitcoin is a decentralized system with mathematically fixed, deflatioary and limited supply currency and its growth is [exponential]( 
 
  So is not farfetched to say that it will be at 100,000 by 2020,  since it came from less than $1 to $7,000 in less than 10 years, and it hasn't even hit the bottom part of the exponential ['S-Curve' of adoption]

Also, he still refuses to implement Segwit to help his users to have lower fees, as he hypocritically alleges was the reason for S2X. And you know why? because Jihan profits more with higher fees. Stephen does not care about the Bitcoin community best interests.

This is not accurate, first, because we do care, and second, because [solutions are being implemented right now and more are coming in the pipeline, Core devs are working very hard]( Just like the Internet was in the 90's was difficult to use, and then 2nd layer apps started to solve the issues, no need to rush anything that would risk Bitcoin's main attributes (core values): Decentralized, Immutable, Trustless, Worldwide-Distributed, Censorless, Permissionless, Antifragile . For now, it is already very valuable as the best store of value available, better than gold.

This is why there is a large transactions backlog (apart from Bitpay and other anti-bitcoin companies refusing to implement Segwit):
The miners leave to mine  b-*ash because it is more profitable, and that is due to the messed up  b-*ash EDA system. This shady and disruptive difficulty adjustment shenanigans are combined with other strategies like 'spam attacks', mining empty blocks, etc. But they will switch back in two days, as they always do when BTC is more profitable:
Source: 
Also there's the coordinated b-*ash pump:




The pumping was mostly from Korea, again, with more than 60% (abnormal) volume of  b-*ash trading coming from there, combined with coordinated Bcash "supporters" brigades in social media.
We don't know how long this pump will last, but there's nothing real to justify a $1,000 price for  b-*ash even for a medium term. Some of us wish it would last till January 1st, when Coinbase will release hundreds of thousands of  b-*ash coins, most of which will be dumped for BTC.

* 1) You would miss out on the free money: You get one S2X coin for every BTC you have at the time of the fork. 
 
* 2) The vast majority of Bitcoiners are planning to dump S2X for BTC as soon as they can, so it will probably look just [like last fork](
 
* 3) The math you need to do is what you think B2X will be worth. For instance, say BTC is worth $7500 at the fork with B2X worth $2000. This means BTC has to fall to less than $5500 for you to lose money. A 26%+ drop in literally an hour? Not impossible but not probable (credit to u/SsurebreC).
 
* 4) The wave of people planning to sell BTC post-fork because are expecting a dip/correction/crash will get canceled-out by the wave of people waiting to buy BTC post-fork for the exact same reasons (last time, the second group was larger and the price skyrocketed).

Welcome to Bitcoin! Here are some info and resources (at the bottom) to get you started:

 &gt; Here's Bitcoin's [response]( to Jamie Dimon. Stick to the [real Bitcoin]( through all the ['forks' and 'splits']( that accomplish nothing but new mediocre, unsafe and centralized altcoins, [strengthen/immunize](  Bitcoin and give you free altcoins to buy more Bitcoin.


 &gt; All [Central Powers look silly]( trying to [control]( or [ban]( it. Learn from [history]( and listen to this [absolute Boss]( There will never be enough Bitcoin for every existing millionaire to own just ONE SINGLE BITCOIN, [Total number of millionaires (in USD value) worldwide is around 33 million]( BTC is the [best money](
 &gt; 
 &gt; Also relax, you are actually an [early adopter]( BTC is still [relatively small](  [mentally prepare]( yourself for healthy and expected market volatility/dips/corrections/"crashes" (check out this amazing ['Corrections Trends Perspective']( and remember all this:


 &gt; &gt; **Follow this basic rules of Bitcoin**:


 


 




 &gt; &gt; Everybody parroting: "[The bitcoin bubble is about to pop]( since 2009, don't know that bitcoin is a decentralized system with mathematically fixed, deflationary and limited supply currency and its growth is [exponential]( not linear. When they bring up the overused "2000 Dotcom Bubble collapse" argument, tell them: [I hope so!](




 &gt; &gt;  So is not farfetched to say that it will be at 100,000 by 2020,  since it came from less than $1 to $5,000 in less than 10 years, and it hasn't even hit the bottom part of the exponential ['S-Curve' of adoption]

 &gt; &gt; Check out this great 2017 MIT study: ["The Cryptocurrency Market Is Growing Exponentially"]( Patience [pays]( don't listen to most ["Expert Analysts"]  ( or [MSM"](

 &gt; &gt; Bitcoin has outperformed every other currency, commodity, stock and asset since its inception in 2009: ["2017: Bitcoin Beats Stocks, Bonds, And Gold, Again”](
 &gt; &gt;  Bitcoin, the [Moneybadger]( is the first unseizable store of value in human history, unlike gold, equities, or fiat, it can't be confiscated if stored correctly. How banks think [blockchain will disrupt their industry]( Check out these Bitcoin [Economy]( and Bitcoin [Transaction]( infographics.




 &gt; &gt; Also, remember its [fixed, limited supply of 21 million coins ever,]( there are just ~4.5 million (~20%)  bitcoins left to be mined till 2140 and the production will keep decreasing ("halving") every [4 years till then](  So, remember [this]( and [don't wait for the Bitcoin "bubble" to burst]( or for the price to drop significantly again, because you could be waiting forever:

Did you read all the evidence OP included on this very post as of why Roger, r/btc, bitcoin.com, etc is a big scam?
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:01:04
3 comments here, 3 r/btc pumpers.
This is why there is a large transactions backlog (apart from Bitpay and other anti-bitcoin companies refusing to implement Segwit):
The miners leave to mine  b-*ash because it is more profitable, and that is due to the messed up  b-*ash EDA system. This shady and disruptive difficulty adjustment shenanigans are combined with other strategies like 'spam attacks', mining empty blocks, etc. But they will switch back in two days, as they always do when BTC is more profitable:
Source: 
Also there's the coordinated b-*ash pump:




The pumping was mostly from Korea, again, with more than 60% (abnormal) volume of  b-*ash trading coming from there, combined with coordinated Bcash "supporters" brigades in social media.
We don't know how long this pump will last, but there's nothing real to justify a $1,000 price for  b-*ash even for a medium term. Some of us wish it would last till January 1st, when Coinbase will release hundreds of thousands of  b-*ash coins, most of which will be dumped for BTC.
Edit: Added source.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:50:26
Still very early in the game. Bitcoin is growing exponentially. Every dip get's bought fast by newcomers and other people that were piling for a dip. Also, we haven't even hit the bottom of the "S-Curve" of adoption/growth and institutional money hasn't yet started to pour in. So, the price at $10,000 is still very cheap for this 'digital gold' of very scarce supply.

Yes, it is obvious, despite the massive amounts of new commenters pumping bcash here and downvoting these posts.
 In [one day and 8 hrs]( from now, the miners will be back to mining Bitcoin and the mempool will be cleared.
 
 Bitcoin will be again [much more profitable (3x)]( to mine. So, hodl on till Monday. Right now the other coin has [&gt;50% of total hashrate](
Source: 
These attacks are great opportunities for those waiting for a low entry point to buy Bitcoin. Buy now, and if it goes lower, buy more (I don't think it's going below $6000).
The bclone dump will come, as always. Better sell pumped bclone (expensive) for depressed BTC (cheap) at this time. Bcash has no future for many reasons, but this is the most important to point out and easier to understand: It is a centralized altcoin, controlled and manipulated by a few unethical and non-technical individuals. They have money to pump and they have tools to deceive like Bitcoin.com and r/btc, and other stuff named after the real Bitcoin.
So, this is my message to Roger:
Please re-name your website, your altcoin, your subreddit, your news-site, etc. to something different than Bitcoin. You decided to fork-off, go play with your toys and stop pretending you and all your stuff belong to the Bitcoin community. Stop using fraudulently the Bitcoin name and stop deceiving newcomers that are buying a knock-off coin thinking they've got the real Bitcoin.

And they just confirmed:












What a bunch of BS, we haven't seen any "endorsements", only an avalanche of S2X/NYA drop-outs, withdrawals and widespread condemnations. Bye-bye, Bread! We had a good run. They are now on my black-list. How much DCG "donated" to them? there's no excuse for them not to condemn the S2X attack on Bitcoin and be more clear about their stance.

Damn right! I used to support OB1, but now I'm very disappointed they got corrupted by [DCG]( they were good guys, just like [these]( before they got to them. 
Of course, who thought that the ones holding the centralized financial power today, would sit on their hands and let Bitcoin take that power away?

[Exposed: How Bankers are trying to centralize and highjack Bitcoin by buying "supporters" and promoters (like OpenBazaar team) for the B2X (S2X/NYA) attack on Bitcoin.](
TL;DR: B2X (S2X/NYA) is nothing more than an open attack on Bitcoin, not an "upgrade" as they want to sell it. This attack has no 'consensus', at all. It was "agreed" by a bunch of miners and corporations behind closed doors, with no community nor developers support.
Only miners and a few millionaires that stand to profit from the B2X attack support it. The vast majority of the Bitcoin community is totally against this attack on Bitcoin. Most of those companies are under DCG group:

Expose the hidden motives and people behind it, so everybody is well informed and there is no confusion about the real Bitcoin and the altcoins with 'bitcoin' in their name.

Sam Patterson, Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, Mike Hearn, Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, John Mcaffe, Craig Wright, Barry Silbert, Larry Summers, Blythe Masters, Stephen Pair, Erik Voorhees, Vinny Lingham and Brian Armstrong.
Once people are informed, they won't be fooled (like all the poor guys at r/btc) and will follow Bitcoin instead of Bizcoin or Bcash or any other centralized altcoin they come up with disguised as Bitcoin.

Bcash is effectively just an altcoin, and a centralized one at that, still barely surviving only because Roger Ver is pumping it, as soon as he finished drying up the bcash buyers/holders and he drops it, it will be dead. People like you come here with such riduculous posts and then go running back to r/btc yelling: "See guys! r/bitcoin censored me!!!".

Because it is not organic, it is a sub funded by deep-pockets Bankers/Corporations supporting bcash, S2X, and everything anti-bitcoin (disguised as anti-core/anti-Blockstream). Those deep-pockets want control and centralization of Bitcoin. See who is behind their funding:

Because, if they are already in Coinbase you can dump the S2X coins ASAP! Everybody will be selling, also at that time is not safe to be moving your coins, and by the time you do that, the money you will get for your S2X coins will be much lower. It is a risk, like with BCH, but people like free money!
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:33:22
They have also their Vault service, it is very safe (not even you can withdraw your own coins before passing for a rigorous and safe process), they store all of the Bitcoins in cold-storage, offline. They have also muti-sig service, where you have your own private keys. Even for the tech savvy, it is much more probable (based on history) that you lose your coins if you store them yourself (for many reasons).

Expose them on social media. Every bitcoiner should know about what [DCG (digital Currency Group)]( is, and call out publicly these people that are working for the Corporations/Bankers against Bitcoin: 








 Focus your education/pressure efforts on just two people, if even one of them withdraws, S2X/NYA is effectively dead. And those two are:
* Barry Silbert   
* Brian Armstrong   
Anyway, if they decide to stick to S2X altcoin, they will end up bankrupt from the loss of real bitcoins and from the subsequent lawsuits. Bitcoin would be set back a little bit (like what happened with the recent China+Bankers attack), but Moneybadger don't care, it will emerge stronger than ever, blasting through $10,000 and beyond.

 Everybody parroting: "The bitcoin bubble is about to pop" since 2009, don't know that bitcoin is a decentralized system with mathematically fixed, deflatioary and limited supply currency and its growth is [exponential]( 
 
 
  &gt;  So is not farfetched to say that it will be at 100,000 by 2020,  since it came from less than $1 to $5,000 in less than 10 years, and it hasn't even hit the bottom part of the exponential ['S-Curve' of adoption]
 &gt; (
  &gt; Check out this great 2017 MIT study: ["The Cryptocurrency Market Is Growing Exponentially"]( Patience [pays]( don't listen to the ["Expert Analysts on MSM"](
"Bubble!" That's the exact same thing people said when it hit $1 in 2009, then $10, then $100, now over $5000 and will continue to say at $10,000, $100,000...﻿and so on.
Bitcoin has outperformed every other currency, commodity, stock and asset since its inception in 2009.

Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.
If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to "ban" it.
 Check out this great articles: 
 
 [*"What Gave Bitcoin Its Value?"*](
 [*"How do Bitcoins have value?"*](
Bitcoin is becoming more and more practical by the week, like for worldwide cheap and fast money transfers (remittances) to 3rd world underbanked Countries. Email in the 90's: "It needs to be easier to send", or Internet then also: "It needs to be easier to use". Bitcoin is just beginning but it will have a huge impact, I think the future economy will be digital and decentralized.
Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). "Backed by Government" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.
**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**
* Very cheap regardless of amount $$$ sent.
* Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)
* Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
* Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
* Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)
* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
* Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
* Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
* Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
*And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.*

Only miners and a few millionaires that stand to profit from the B2X attack support it. The vast majority of the Bitcoin community is totally against this attack on Bitcoin. Most of those companies are under DCG group:

Bitcoin is at all-time high very often because its growth is exponential, not linear, and will remain like that for decades to come till we reach the top of the 'S' curve and it becomes linear (we are now still at the bottom of that curve). As soon as you understand that, will buy always now, and not wait for the future, since the probability that it is higher in the future is much greater than the opposite. We are at the stage the [Internet was on the 90's]( Price will continue to rise for decades to come, the supply is fixed and limited.
It is always a good time to buy Bitcoin if you plan to Hodl for the long term.

That Bitcoin is 'anonymous' is just a myth, Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed transparent ledger.

They didn't know all the facts when they signed, they were deceived, so it is totally legit to withdraw. Distrust in them would ensue if they know this is an attack on Bitcoin and still remain supporting B2X. So, far from what you suggest, they regained our trust by withdrawing.

They can't be really hacked because they keep the coins in cold storage. Also, their Vault service is even safer.

Expose the hidden motives and people behind it, so everybody is well informed and there is no confusion about the real Bitcoin and the altcoins with 'bitcoin' in their name. 
Learn about what [DCG (digital Currency Group)]( is and call out publicly these people that are working for the Corporations/Bankers against Bitcoin: 
Sam Patterson, Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, Mike Hearn, Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, John Mcaffe, Craig Wright, Barry Silbert, Larry Summers, Blythe Masters, Stephen Pair, Erik Voorhees, Vinny Lingham and Brian Armstrong.
Once people are informed, they won't be fooled (like all the poor guys at r/btc) and will follow Bitcoin instead of Bizcoin or Bcash or any other centralized altcoin they come up with disguised as Bitcoin.
 Focus your education/pressure efforts on just two people, if even one of them withdraws, S2X/NYA is effectively dead. And those two are:
* Barry Silbert   
* Brian Armstrong   
Anyway, if they decide to stick to S2X altcoin, they will end up bankrupt from the loss of real bitcoins and from the subsequent lawsuits. Bitcoin would be set back a little bit (like what happened with the recent China+Bankers attack), but Moneybadger don't care, it will emerge stronger than ever, blasting through $10,000 and beyond.

No, Bitcoin is rising because it is growing exponentially, and without the 'fork-attacks' the price would be already over $10,000 because the uncertainty factor.

Weak point. We already saw how the biggest, most authoritarian, most populated and fastest economic growing Country in the world reacted against Bitcoin, and Moneybadger didn't give a fuck. Democratic and separation-of-powers governments can't react nearly as forcefully and fast as China did.
Nobody, no individual and no central power or government can control, manipulate, ban, hack or kill a worldwide distributed open-source peer-to-peer cryptographically secured decentralized system.
Bitcoins will continue to increase in value, more than gold and silver, there will only be 21 million bitcoins ever, they are cryptographically and mathematically secured, it is decentralized, so can't be banned, co-opted or confiscated/stolen by any central group or government, you hold your own private keys.

There hasn't been a single bitcoin community come out in support of the S2X attack on Bitcoin, of course, why would they? They'd be an anti-Bitcoin community if they did.
Of course &gt;99% of bitcoiners support Bitcoin, is that hard to believe? The only ones supporting the 2X Trojan horse are this [power-hungry crooks]( and the companies (including miners) and individuals they have bribed with their deep pockets.
By running the latest core nodes and exposing the S2X/NYA as the scam it is, we may prevent it from succeeding, despite them following the hash rate at the time of the fork as they have stated they will in an attempt to hijack Bitcoin.
Educate yourself if you think this is just 'crazy conspiracy' talk:
Think about this:
Of course, who thought that the ones holding the centralized financial power today (famous for back-door shady plots to consolidate even more power and control), would sit on their hands and let Bitcoin just stroll in and easily take that power away from them?

We need to keep posting the relevant fact about what S2X/NYA really is and who are the powerful forces behind the attack.
We can't get complacent, we have only half a month to go.

[Exposed: How Bankers are trying to centralize and highjack Bitcoin by buying "supporters" and promoters (like OpenBazaar team) for the B2X (S2X/NYA) attack on Bitcoin.](
TL;DR: B2X (S2X/NYA) is nothing more than an open attack on Bitcoin, not an "upgrade" as they want to sell it. This attack has no 'consensus', at all. It was "agreed" by a bunch of miners and corporations behind closed doors, with no community nor developers support.
Only miners and a few millionaires that stand to profit from the B2X attack support it. The vast majority of the Bitcoin community is totally against this attack on Bitcoin. Most of those companies are under DCG group:

Exactly, we can't leave this to chance or "the markets to decide" when there is such a malicious intent to manipulate the markets by those powerful players. So  that's why all the people saying: "Don't worry, S2X won't happen" or "S2X is DOA" need to stop,  we are at a 'make-or-break' moment for Bitcoin. It's very dumb to underestimate them. If you don't know yet who those malicious players are, read below:

It's not assuming rationality in all scenarios presented. Read it again. Even if the miners remain irrational, they end up losing if the S2X fork succeeds. They lose in every scenario presented except 2: 
a) S2X fork failing (BTC remains the only coin, everybody wins except Barry and friends).
b) S2X fork happening but miners mine BTC, even if it is not the most profitable, since if they mine S2X (even if it is more profitable) they end up losing because that forces BTC to switch to PoW (rendering the ASIC's obsolete on the BTC chain).
So, that's why OP said in the title that miners should be hoping that S2X fails, since in all scenarios where S2X 'wins'-------&gt;the miners end up losing (either immediately or at the end).
Thanks OP, for the great analysis.
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:56:25
Agree, I just wish he would join the fight against B2X and explain why it is an attack on Bitcoin and not an "upgrade" as it is being sold by Barry and friends. I know he likes to be neutral, and that's great, but we could use his help against these deep pocket guys that are buying a lot of people to support and promote this attack, giving the illusion that B2X has some support, when it really doesn't.

It is an actual open and concrete attack, regardless of the final result if the attack is successful or not. Like if somebody throws a punch at you, but you know Aikido and manage to avoid/deflect it, your skill does not erase the fact that someone attacked you. So the question is: Can an attack exist if it does not result in the intended damage? I think it does. So, the damage was attempted by an actual and deliberate attack.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:46:57
Yes, it will, but we can limit the damage if we keep exposing the attack, but don't underestimate these people, they have very deep pockets.

There is no freedom of choice when one side has billions of dollars against your "choice", look at the "free" elections  or the "free" gold market (manipulated ETF with leveraged paper contracts). So, if we don't have those billions, we can use social media to level the plain field, like exposing the true nature of S2X/NYA as an attempt to centralize and hijack Bitcoin. We can't let that to happen. If the big companies follow the hash-rate/miners, and then enough bitcoiners get fooled by those crooks, Bitcoin will lose (unfairly) against the scam/attack.

That's not a retraction, is just a weak attempt to save face, commenting when Garzik was exposed as another Banker puppet.

That's not accurate and a common misconception, the "Terms of Service" do not absolve any company from any fraud or from any liabilities. If they go for S2X they will be sued to hell, for sure. There are groups and individuals preparing the lawsuits as we speak (I'll be joining a 'Class Action' lawsuit). They have a 'fiduciary obligation' towards their customers, and switching their Bitcoins for an altcoin would go clearly against that obligation.

Nobody, no individual and no central power or government can control, manipulate, ban, hack or kill a worldwide distributed open-source peer-to-peer cryptographically secured decentralized system. Bitcoins will continue to increase in value, more than gold and silver, there will only be 21 million bitcoins ever, they are cryptographically and mathematically secured, it is decentralized, so can't be banned, co-opted or confiscated/stolen by any central group or government, you hold your own private keys.

Great advice. We can work on several fronts at the same time, we have the numbers, it will help also to expose in every possible social media the hidden motives and people behind S2X/NYA, so everybody is well informed and there is no confusion between the real Bitcoin and the altcoins with 'bitcoin' in their name. 
Also, every bitcoiner should know about what [DCG (digital Currency Group)]( is, and call out publicly these people that are working for the Corporations/Bankers against Bitcoin: 
Sam Patterson, Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, Mike Hearn, Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, John Mcaffe, Craig Wright, Barry Silbert, Larry Summers, Blythe Masters, Stephen Pair, Erik Voorhees, Vinny Lingham and Brian Armstrong.
Once people are informed, they won't be fooled (like all the poor guys at r/btc) and will follow Bitcoin instead of Bizcoin or Bcash or any other centralized altcoin they come up with disguised as Bitcoin.
 Focus your education/pressure efforts on just two people, if even one of them withdraws, S2X/NYA is effectively dead. And those two are:
* Barry Silbert   
* Brian Armstrong   
Anyway, if they decide to stick to S2X altcoin, they will end up bankrupt from the loss of real bitcoins and from the subsequent lawsuits. Bitcoin would be set back a little bit (like what happened with the recent China+Bankers attack), but Moneybadger don't care, it will emerge stronger than ever, blasting through $10,000 and beyond.

This is the right answer.
'Spend &amp; Replace', that still counts as hodling.

Nothing medium and long term, Bitcoin as called 'Moneybadger' because it adapts to anything and don't give a fuck about what centralized institutions/governments do to try to kill it. It gets immunized with every new snake bite and stronger after every predator attack. Nothing can kill Bitcoin as long as we, individuals around the world, support its existence. 
Short term, yes, some disruptions, a price dip to buy more coins, but nothing fatal.

He could be hodling 90% of his coins, and live in luxury with 10% sodl.

That's not accurate and a common misconception, the "Terms of Service" do not absolve any company from any fraud or from any liabilities. If they go for S2X they will be sued to hell, for sure. There are groups and individuals preparing the lawsuits as we speak (I'll be joining a 'Class Action' lawsuit). They have a 'fiduciary obligation' towards their customers, and switching their Bitcoins for an altcoin would go clearly against that obligation.

BAM!

Unocoin is a scammer company in bed with Barry/DCG, it is planning to steal your coins by supporting the S2X attack on Bitcoin. Do not use them.
@_date: 2017-10-07 12:49:17
Yes, B2X from now on ...till it dies.
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:12:11
Yes, we have answered that question many times when you ask pretending not to understand why S2X/NYA is an open attack on Bitcoin and not an "upgrade" with anything to do with scaling.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:29:51
Agree, but it is not the 'law' we have right now. So we should use all the resources at our disposition, even the centralized ones.

Bitcoin growth is exponential, and we haven't even hit the bottom of the "S" Curve of technology adoption graphic.

Will do in my future S2X-bashing posts. Also, can somebody edit Brian out of this [pic](
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:38:50
Good for them!
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:28:01
Yes but it's important that 'the market' is well informed and aware of hidden-scams and disguised-attacks, so it can make an informed decision, instead of being fooled like the people at r/btc.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:28:48
Thank you! I guess this kills many of the fake arguments from the S2X/NYA trolls.
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:29:53
Rusia is completely irrelevant to Bitcoin. They have no volume.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:20:45
All you have to do is get  them to watch [this Andreas video]( their mind will be blown.

Because S2X is nothing more than an open attack on Bitcoin, not an "upgrade" as they want to sell it. S2X/NYA attack has no 'consensus', at all. It was "agreed" by a bunch of miners and corporations behind closed doors, with no community nor developers support.
Only miners and a few millionaires that stand to profit from the S2X attack support it. The vast majority of the Bitcoin cummunity is totally agaist this attack on Bitcoin. Most of those companies are under DCG group:

Congrats, thanks for sharing!


That's the correct strategy: Spend-and-Replace. For all those arguing that just Hodling is bad for Bitcoin since you don't want to spend it for fear of it going higher and regret selling your precious Bitcoins.
With this win-win-win strategy, you have the best of all worlds: Store of value, savings+'dividends', avoid volatility, continuing-investment, benefits/rewards Bitcoin-accepting businesses, helps promote Bitcoin to make it more mainstream, etc.
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:58:52
Bitfury? WTF, I thought they were good guys? Were they bribed by Barry also?
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:16:15
I think he meant 100000
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:59:14
Spend &amp; Replace is the best strategy and it is still considered as Hodling, since your amount of Bitcoins remains the same.
@_date: 2017-10-08 10:56:54


False, quit making excuses for those con-men.
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:56:57
I also think that's the best strategy, IMHO.
