Actually you can't. You don't actually own that gbtc. You can't own fractional units of an equity/security. Period.
What you own is a ledger entry on stockpile's database, saying that if you want to sell your 65 usd worth of gbtc, they would have to liquidate the equities in their stock portfolio and pay you the cash resulting from that sale on the other end. Stockpile aggregates their trading activity once a day to maintain a portfolio that is reflective of what their customers are holding. Essentially they are selling "IOUs" (credits) for different stocks, and depending on what their customers "buy" and "sell" (they're not actually buying or selling anything) that is when stockpile (the company)  executes trades at the end of each trading day to keep everything in order. Similar to the way an ETF works.

It just lowers the cost of entry. Before, 1 share of gbtc was approx 1700 usd. Now 1 share will cost a little less than 20 usd.
Shares are not like Bitcoin, you can't buy fractions of stock shares. So this lowers the barrier (cost) of entering the gbtc market.

But you were talking about visa. And Visa doesn't take 7 days to clear from a customer perspective. Visa takes on the risk of chargeback and fraud, and through the sheer volume of transactions they facilitate, they offer instant settlement from a customer perspective. Then, they forward and distribute that fraud as a "cost of doing business" on to their customers. Usually that comes in as a customer seeing a 3% increase in price.
I'm fine with debating the cost of settlement with Visa. But it's disingenuous to talk about the settlement time of Visa from a customer perspective since that is literally the thing the credit market is designed to abstract away from the customer.

The fee you pay is for the resources consumed by the miner and the externalities placed on the full nodes, as well as the opportunity cost of including your transaction instead of somebody else's into the mined block. That is a function (for the purpose of this discussion) of the amount of data being stored on the blockchain. Hence why we use fees in terms of BTC per byte (or more commonly, satoshis/byte)

Coinbase is responsible for high percentage of on chain transactions. Their switching would be beneficial to not only their direct user base, but also to the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole.

Sorry that's just not true. Maybe you have a misunderstanding about what we could achieve with segwit.
Unless everyone starts using P2WSH (pay to witness script hash) blocks we will top out around 1.7 to 2mb...maybe 4mb might happen if the WHOLE network moves over to LN (if the entirety of blocks consisted of native segwit multisig txns used to open/close channels ) , but it seems pretty unlikely given our learning about P2SH adoption since 2014.

Please note that while this is probably correct in this particular scenario, a 3 address is simply a P2sh (pay to script hash) address. We are currently wrapping segwit addresses within P2sh scripts because it's easier and faster to on board wallets that way.
3 addresses also are commonly used for multisignature addresses.

It doesn't depend on how much money you're sending. It depends on the size. If you have 6 utxo that add up to 100 bucks, and you want to spend a 90 dollar transaction, those 6 have to get added together, making a much larger transaction than a simple 1 in 2 out type transaction.

I don't buy from any one in particular. But I can tell you that you will get significantly less fees taken by Gemini, who charge 0.25% trading fee (I think) and they have implemented segwit.
Buying from Coinbase directly charges something like 10x to 15x (edit 6x) that rate. And they haven't implemented segwit after pushing for segwit2x.  GDAX (owned by Coinbase) also charges 0.25%. If you have a Coinbase account you have a gdax account.
Point is, there are much cheaper ways to trade, if that's your thing.

Wow. Thank you so much for this fantastic, informative, and extremely thorough response!  It is for exactly this reason that I still have faith in Bitcoin and this community.  Thanks so much for taking the time to answer - Have some gold :)
I have a few minor followups that I hope it's not too much trouble I ask:


In this particular scenario, it depends not only on being able to find the necessary hash collisions to steal the funds from the 2-2 multisig, but also being able to do so in some reasonable amount of time, right?  I mean if it takes a week to generate 2^80 hashes, the other party is not going to sit around and wait this amount of time, given that the addresses are known to be somewhat vulnerable to these collision attacks (assuming the requisite amount of computing power to actually generate this enormous amount of hashes is possible in such a short time is somehow possible).  So it's not just that it the calculations must be made, but also be done in some short amount of time so as to not raise 'red flags' with the other party, right?


So I understand the collision attack scenario, but why does this also apply to P2SH-wrapped Segwit outputs?  I was reading  and couldn't quite figure this last part out.
Thanks again for the great information!
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:39:41
Hey, I hope you don't mind me resurrecting an old post of yours but I've been trying to find some more information on P2SH security and I remembered that I read P2SH has 80 bits of security a while back, it might have even been from your post here.
Anyways, if it's not too much trouble, I was wondering if you could explain a little more about why/how P2SH has 80bit security as compared with the typical BTC txn (or a native Bech32 segwit txn), or if you have a reference I could read up on to get more information?

You can encrypt a read-only medium (i.e. A CD-Rom) if your recovery seed with a strong symmetric key algorithm (AES256 ) and store that in a safe deposit box. That way you know that if the drive is ever confiscated or stolen, the person in possession of it can't access it. The bank vault provides physical security, and writing it to something semi permanent like a CD-Rom instead of a USB stick, for example, ensure that you won't have drive degradation due to any weird volatility effects.

I understand that. But they are not very precise with their estimations. If the average fee to get in 1 block is 200, is it suitable to pay 2x that? What about 500 or 750 sat/byte?  They shouldn't be just excessively estimating fees just to be "safe". I'm sure their customer would also care if they spent 25 bucks on a txn that should have cost 8.

If you buy a Bitcoin at 1000usd and the exchange requires you to have 1500usd in your account before they liquidate your position on a 50% move in the asset, go ahead and use whatever words you want to use to describe that. It's full reserve shorting.

Let me play devils advocate here. How can you make that statement? It's been around for 9 years, and it's really only been purchasable to the public for maybe 7.5 years. How can you even make any sort of informed assessment of long term investment potential when we have so little data to work with?  Most people would consider something between 5 to 10 years as sort of "mid term". Long term is usually reserved for assets like mortgages or multi decade govt debt (just as a time scale reference)

I disapprove of the way Coinbase runs their business. I thought they acted in bad faith many times through their support of S2x and the BCash launch. I simply don't use Coinbase. I don't make posts telling other people to rally behind me in my noble cause. If they agree with me, the decision is easy for them. If not, a post in this vein isn't going to help sway them, most likely.

All of the things you listed in your post are objectionable actions, but by our societal definitions of law, they are not crimes.  Crimes are defined in a negative or counter relationship with respect to an established cultural law.  I disagree with being taxed to pay for a whole litany of things, but I fundamentally understand the distinction between a criminal action and something I just plain disagree with.

This is one of the things I love about the Trezor. The password and adding new accounts allows you to create new xpub keys on the Trezor.  Please correct me if I'm wrong but I think the Ledger only allows for one xpub, and when you make new accounts within the Ledger wallet gui, the addresses within that 2nd account are still derived from the same xpub as the original account.

I would recommend buying an old Dell optiplex or Compaq (see   from Newegg (60usd with shipping), a 1tb hdd (30ish with Shipping) and a USB wifi stick (I got one for 25 on Amazon).
You'll have to learn how to use Linux and command line interfaces, but already with that setup you have something several times more powerful than a ras pi or one of these self assembled computers. Additionally, it's got 4gb of ram, which you can upgrade to 8 gb for 20 bucks.

This is not the correct answer to OPs question. It's actually not the right answer at all. Legacy to bech32 transactions are only available on wallets that have made provisions to actually support that functionality.  Blockchain.info wallet has not done so. Therefore OP cannot do what he is asking about.
Legacy to Segwit is only *always* (i.e. it will always work right "out of the box" with no wallet software modifications needed by the devs) available if you are sending to a P2SH-Nestesd-P2WPKH (address starting with a 3).  It's a very important point that this is absolutely NOT the case when sending to a regular bech32 (bc1...) address.

There was just too much fuckery afoot all over the BTC space in terms of things like security and accountability to lend much validity to the actual $ price in 13.  I feel that making comparisons to that ATH price is either disengenous or just invalid... When the price shoots up too fast it makes me a bit nervous.

They range from simple tit-for-tat (you don't give us block size HF we will block segwit activation) to more conspiratorial (Adam Back is actively trying to hamstring the network to further develop the attractiveness of off chain scaling solutions like LN and side chains... Segwit is critical for LN so we will block segwit).  
There are also some who honestly think that the ETH/ETC fiasco would be fine if a similar solution played itself out on a forked bitcoin chain. Not me. 
It kind of boils down to prioritization of code features.

How can you say that? It clearly introduces a variable into the game theory that wasn't there before. You now have a chain with wildly oscillating difficulty and ASIC miners who can freely switch back and forth.
These are not the days of gpu mining. Altcoins like litecoin don't pose the same existential problem as BCH because entrenched miners using sha256 ASICS can't freely switch to mine litecoin.

Thanks for the reply.  It's always refreshing to have a real level-headed discussion rather than shit slinging that bitcoin too-often devolves into :)


Okay so the difficulty isn't wildly fluctuating, but the hashrate is. And the difficulty really isn't the important thing, as far as I'm concerned.  Have you been watching the hashrate statistics?  BTC lost a significant amount of hashpower to BCH over the last few days.  That is the real issue, not the difficulty number, which is more or less just an inversely correlated measure of hashrate (I understand this is simplified).


A few things have really dawned on me watching this whole BCH shitshow unfold the last week or so.  I saw it with ETH/ETC, but since I was just a bystander during that, it didn't really set in:  At first, I believed, like I'm sure many others did, that a minority chain fork was a proposition that was pretty much DOA.  You fork off with 5%, you can consider yourself dead, opened up to 51% attacks, etc etc.  Gavin convinced (or tried to) the Bitcoin community of this back when Hearn was throwing his shitfit.  It turns out that not only will a vanishingly small minorty survive (I would go so far as to say an minority chain with 1-2% hashpower can survive), but even more so, given the right game theoretic modifications to their forked protocol they might actually THRIVE.  BCH implemented this EDA with the explicit knowledge that they would be fighting a massive uphill battle, and you know what?  It is giving them the fire to keep their dogshit pile burning.  So when I read your comments like 'reliability, security, and decentralization, the only measures that matter. ", it just reminds me of how I thought about this fork before seeing this thing play out in real life.  Here in Bitcoin, we hang our hats on the ruthless capitalistic, profit-maximizing behavior of miners, but we will happily play mind games with ourselves that "the miners wont do THAT just for short-term gain" when it suits us.  They will do THAT, and I think the 40% drop in hashrate showed us that today (look at fork.lol).  We should be very honest about that fact.  Let's not kid ourselves that miners are in it for the ideology.


Listen, you're preaching to the choir.  **I** know the point of Bitcoin, but you simply cannot assume that the **miners** aren't missing the point, when they now have a perverse incentive to "miss the point" for short-term gain.  Honestly, I think we're past the honeymoon stage of Bitcoin where we can assume that miners have ANY ideological bent whatsoever.  The libertarian honeymoon phase passed us by, and they were the glory days, but we can't kid ourselves that that is the ecosystem we still inhabit.
One last thing I'd like to address without coming off as too rambly:


The scenario of BTC miners shutting off is different than the scenario of miners oscillating between two competing chains with essentially 0 friction in switching.  Surely you must recognize that this is something of a point of unstable equilibrium with respect to mining?
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:08:11
You can't deny that hash rate plummeted the last few days. Okay maybe you can't use a 3day line to get actual values, but the trend is very alarming. Quite a precipitous drop-off.
At the very least we lost 20 percent. I don't buy that you cant trust a 7day MA.

You must clearly understand that adding 15 percent hashpower at 30 EH/s is significantly different than adding 15 percent hashpower at 100 PH/s (for example)?
As economies grow, you should expect to see percentage gains decrease, otherwise you'd be stuck in a parabolic uptrend. I was not commenting on the percentage gain (this is the reason I explicitly didn't state it in percentage terms, because it's not all that remarkable as a percent) but rather the massive amount of physical hardware (silicon and metal) that must have been switched on to cause this rise we observed.

It would be quite a long shot. They would have to invest an absolutely massive amount of money over a long period of time to even double the hashpower. So that they could cut it in half... But it is in theory possible.  Especially with markets available to short Bitcoin, we need to be aware of those kinds of attack vectors.

Well first of all it didn't double, it went up 15 percent. But I'll say to you the same thing I said to someone else:
You must clearly understand that adding 15 percent hashpower at 30 EH/s is significantly different than adding 15 percent hashpower at 100 PH/s (for example)?
As economies grow, you should expect to see percentage gains decrease, otherwise you'd be stuck in a parabolic uptrend. I was not commenting on the percentage gain (this is the reason I explicitly didn't state it in percentage terms, because it's not all that remarkable as a percent) but rather the massive amount of physical hardware (silicon and metal) that must have been switched on to cause this rise we observed.

So by this measure, Bitcoin is the blockchain, end of story?  The blockchain at what height, excatly?  If I print the genesis block alone, is that "Bitcoin"?  
Sorry, but I reject your thesis that Bitcoin, the technology, can exist without the internet (or another 2-way data communication technology).  You can be reductionist all you want with claiming that blocks are just hashed tables of transactions, but Bitcoin - the technology - ceases to exist if communication stops.  A printed copy of the blockchain (which becomes outdated immediately, but that's besides the point) is no more "Bitcoin" than a stack of Encyclopedia Brittanica's from 1987 is Wikipedia.  These technologies are emergent phenomena, and to be reductionist about them is to miss what makes them special as technological advances.

Leading zeroes is not quite accurate. The hash must be under the target, but the difference in x leading 0s and x+1 leading zeroes is a factor of 2. If it were just about leading zeroes then Bitcoin would not be able to adjust difficulty by less than a 2x or 1/2x multiple

I mean I guess I reject the thesis that value exists independent of price. Value is not like mass or density. It is not a physically measurable thing that exists outside of the domain in which it is measured. Value is a human construction, so it has to be measured in human derived quantities, and therefore it does not exist outside of the purview of the human defined measurement mechanism (price).

Valid. I think the key is the mentality which is being cultivated. Yes, it's an investment, and a highly speculative one at that. HOWEVER  I'm sure many people here take x percent out of their paycheck and buy Bitcoin with it.

Not true. There are real world consequences for credit card fraud. You have to interact with the credit card company with your real identity, file a charge back with a fraudulent (making the same assumption of fraudulent double spending and fraudulent charge back) claim, and follow that through to the end. If you are suspected or caught doing credit card fraud, you face real world penalties, and you are trivial to track down and prosecute.
Compare that with a guy who pays for a 200 dollar meal, walks out of the restaurant, and double spends his transaction upon leaving the front door, never to return there again.  Nobody knows his identity unless they carded him for alcohol or something like that.
These two are very different scenarios.

I'll even grant you calling them "fireworks" since that's what everyone likes to say. There is a method and procedure for shipping fireworks through the mail. That comes with proper licensing and proper markings on the outside of all the boxes. Without shipping them properly, you put the safety of dozens or hundreds of unwitting postal employees at risk.

Real identities are involved when using credit cards and requesting charge backs. The same is unequivocally not true of Bitcoin.
If you think the risk profile is the same for both of these, you're either being disingenuous to prove a point or you don't see there's a difference.


Most credit card fraud is not a result of fraudulent charge backs. Most of it is the result of stolen cc numbers.

You're welcome. This is one thing that I wish someone had described to me earlier because it never made much sense to me how we could have difficulty adjustments of 0.02% (or some other small number) if it was just about getting a certain amount of leading 0s and nothing else.
In reality, a hash is just an enormously huge integer, and we are trying to find one below the target value. That means you'll need leading 0s, but all of the numbers after the leading 0s are equally as important because that is how the difficulty changes by increments smaller than 2x or 1/2x.

With WU and MG, you're essentially paying for  your currency to be transferred and dispensed (and held until receiving party can get it) by a trusted and reputable company into the currency of your choosing at the receivers address. With Btc remittance, the transferring and receiving parties take on significantly more risk and responsibility (getting into and out of BTC to cash is often illegal and can come with risks of physical violence from meeting unknown strangers with bundles of cash.)  think of the remittance fees that WU charges as compensation for the risk mitigation they perform on the sender and receivers behalf... Btc remittances would work if the receivers could spend Btc and didn't have to "cash out" into local fiat. That takes increased worldwide adoption.

Edit: I suppose you were using address reuse in how it pertains to privacy. I was mainly considering it w.r.t. Security. I suppose both are right, so I stand corrected. I would then put forward that 1 paper wallet per exchange should suffice, if you're just dumping stuff off of exchanges into cold storage. 
I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt that you're not just trolling me... Address reuse specifically refers to the reusing (re-signing) of transactions from the same pubkeyhash (address). It most certainly  does not mean that sending 5 txns to the same input, and then sweeping them all at once some time in the future (and then NEVER using that address again) , would be considered address reuse in any typical sense. It would also not constitute a compromise of any cryptographic integrity. 
Here's from your quoted text:


The reason you don't want to sign multiple transactions from the same address (which if you sweep everything at once off of that address, doesn't happen) is because you expose the raw pubkey (not the pubkey hash) at the time of signing. Addresses are obfuscated from the pubkey as addresses (starting with a 1) through ripemd/SHA256 hashes, so you don't know the raw pubkey that corresponds with the address before txn signing. This gives addresses dual-layer security, one through the use of hash obfuscation, and the 2nd through the mathematically hard problem of brute forcing an ECDSA private key from its corresponding public key. When you re-use addresses (sign outputs multiple times from the same address) you are breaking the hash obfuscation layer, which leaves you only with ECDSA. ECDSA is not quantum resistant, while hashes are.

No. High explosives describes the tendency of the material to undergo detonation and not deflagration. Deflagration is common to things like gunpowder and is dangerous when confined due to pressure buildup and release of large volumes of gaseous products . From what I understand these pest control things were flash powder. Flash powder is classically flake aluminum and potassium perchlorate/chlorate, which is classified as an HE by the ATF, and is very dangerous, especially to impact. The fact that Ver ever put that shit into unlabeled mail packs that unwitting USPS carriers handled is so dangerous its hard to imagine he only served 1 year. There's a reason you have to clearly label the box when sending ammunition, which is FAR less dangerous and can be thrown off a building without going off. That's absolutely NOT the case for flash powder.

Suffice to say that if an attacker gets into your email, you're pretty much fucked. Email nowadays is pretty much used universally for password reset. Attackers have found ingenious ways to subvert 2fa, so it's game over once email is compromised.
Tip for Bitcoiners: use a 20+ alphanumeric /special character password for your email and NEVER USE THAT PASSWORD FOR ANYTHING ELSE, EVER. It should be unique and never reused.

The hash rate is not explicitly known. It is inferred from the block discovery times. There is a predictable relationship between hash rate and block time. This is one of the fundamental ideas that Bitcoin is built upon.

Yes, they were just selling bitcoins.  However, I think the kicker here was that the cops explicitly told the seller that they would be using the BTC to purchase stolen CC numbers.  I think this is a dirty and reprehensible thing.  They wanted to tack on extra charges - they could have just arrested him for doing unlicensed money transmissions (still bullshit), but they chose to go over the top and make him an accessory in another FAKE crime.  Just like with Ulbricht.  Cops can literally **make shit up** and then arrest and charge you for being an accessory to a crime that never happened.  It's almost unbelievable.

There's only incentive not to cheat to the extent that fees maintain a certain ratio with respect to the total channel balance, in that case. And that doesn't actually solve the problem, really, it just moves it slightly.
Watchtowers do not change things - they only allow you to offload on-chain arbitration to another party in case of a breach. Eltoo changes things, yes, but I believe it is in the wrong direction, since it does away with breach remedy txns sweeping the whole channel (pretty sure, but not 100%).

Do you think that when we're talking about people on $2/day that its just like some farmer making $2/day selling beans, but he just happens to live next to a Starbucks with a sweet Wifi connection?  If you have access to public wifi (im assuming public wifi, because on $2/day you are trying to cover the bare necessities, so you can't really get Comcast to run fiber to your front door), you're probably living in a location or country where your income is more than that.  The situation that is typically described of these poor people is off by about 1 order of magnitude - ~ $20/day.  Bitcoin is barely even useful for that person. 
No person making that little money is going to go out of their way to use a cumbersome and klugey system like Bitcoin, when cash is easier, doesn't requite internet connection, and everyone in the world understands it.

Yes they're reliable. I find not quite as flexible as Trezor though. I like that you can have multiple passwords which access different wallets on the Trezor, all of which can have child accounts with different xpubs.  Both are highly secure.

Pretty much everything you've said buttresses his original point and not yours. It's not that you cant predict if btc will be useful. It will, it is now, and it will likely become more valuable as time goes on as it becomes useful to more people. It's that you cant predict the chaos, a point on which you are apparently already convinced.
Tom is not only making claims that btc will be highly valuable in the long term (valid-is), but he's also making extremely short-term predictions such as "btc will end the 2018 year at x price", which is just pure gambling and speculation.

You can still audit the code, but you aren't permitted to incorporate and redistribute it. This seems like a sane business model. It both maintains transparency and allows them to make money off their product.

Okay. What's your point though? I didn't say segwit wasn't a good invention. It's awesome and I love what it enables.  But to say that there wasn't controversy around segwit activation is to deny history and the facts of the matter. That's why it took 2 years to activate and a hard fork spun off because of it.

It's all about incentives. Instamines don't necessarily prove the coin is a scam, but they sure do align the incentives in a much more scam-prone direction. I don't think anyone argues that they are unoquivally scams - The world exists in the shades of grey between black and white.

Ok then can you please explain the intention? Because it seems exactly to be making price predictions based on literally one data point, not even two.
Otherwise, why include a picture of the price chart at all? If all you were trying to say was x time until halving, putting the price chart up seems superfluous at best.
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:34:05
It's absolutely not like that at all.
It means that the fees are making certain use cases prohibitively expensive to process on chain. Much like how credit cards are prohibitively expensive for purchases under 50 cents or so. The work and charge back risk that Visa or MasterCard assume in processing that transaction is no longer profitable to the company under a certain amount.  I'm  SW supporter but it's just idiocy to dismiss the fact that we've priced out certain transactions from on-chain processing by comparing and attacking a poorly fitting straw man analogy.

As far as I can tell, the list of shitcoins keeps growing year after year. Coinbase keeps making announcements about new additions and binance keeps adding. You must have some data that says otherwise though.
I'm not too concerned with individual shitcoins. The ecosystem in which they exist is the thing that matter, and that keeps growing.

This is literally the same boat I'm in. I look back at my history and cringe. I spun up an XT node (even made a post about it) , got caught up in the rampant pitchfork mob against core in the beginning, and hated anyone standing in the way of "progress". Then I stopped and I listened to both sides for very long and was just slowly pulled back to core because of the way they press on and keep writing good reliable code. Props to all the core contributors and maintainers. 
At the same time, I still have huge respect for Gavin and Jeff Garzik. I miss them both a ton and I really liked the way Gavin ran the project when he was at the helm. That might not gain me a lot of points here but Im a huge fan of both of them.

No. Open-source implies you can fork and reuse the code. As I understand it, this license permits you to audit and verify the code, but the code cannot be used in your own commercial product (like keepkey)

If you look at the construction of OPs sentence, it does not indicate that the loans are fractional reserve by nature. It indicates that the banks are.
If OP was saying the loans are fractional reserve by nature, I believe they would need something like the conjuction "which", to join the adjacent clauses together.
For example 
"loans, which are fractional reserve by nature..."

Yeah that's very true. Maybe I'm just romanticizing the past. Jeff and Gavin just seemed to never get caught up in the bullshit unlike some of the devs today. Granted there was a lot less of it back then but there is a degree of unprofessionalism in the community today that really gets me down. Unfortunately I find myself getting caught up in contributing to it too often.

I said dual booting is good advice for everyone. It's easy to do and it's free to get Linux. Less malware is written and distributed for Linux OSs, so statistically speaking you're safer running Linux than windows. Especially true for Bitcoiners, who can catastrophically lose their shirts with an attack.

I infer, from your username, that you are a proponent of property rights, although your statements don't sound very 'traditionally' Rothbardian.  This is simply Trezor's way of protecting their intellectual property so that they can make money off it.  The good part is that they are still allowing it to be fully auditable.  Sure, it might be better for 'crypto', or the community, as a whole, but that is not Trezor's priority, especially when we see how easily something like KeepKey just rips off their codebase and puts it into new shiny hardware.
We could compare it to the internet.  Some companies, like google, choose to contribute some of their development money to more fundamental protocol technology that benefits everyone, while others choose to develop and deploy proprietary products.  Both have their merit and both have proven to be effective and profitable if implemented properly.
