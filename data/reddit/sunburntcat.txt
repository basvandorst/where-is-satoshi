There is no “golden” rule other than understanding who is making the trades (bots vs humans) and where the liquidity is flowing.

Keep the copy of the seed phrase in the middle of a thick book. Fires require oxygen to burn, and the internal pages of a book are often left untouched after a fire. If you’ve ever tried to burn old documents like credit card terms of service or 401k account descriptions, you’ll know how hard it is to burn the whole thing.

The fact that only one of the blockchains has 65% of the total market cap means the community is in fact successful at determining which is the chain of real value. Most of these bitcoin spinoffs have single digit dollars in daily trade volume.
To your point that the large number of “bitcoins” is detrimental to the space: the traditional BTC blockchain has only had a handful of times where confirmation times or fees were too high. In those times, traders turned to bitcoin alternatives. The big bitcoin gets funds onto exchanges 99% of the time, despite perceived hinderances on the network going forward.

If that were true, we’d see the volume fall off a cliff in 2014. It shows that even with the bubble of last year, there’s an underlying trend where developing countries are moving it peer to peer instead of through buy/sell orders on exchanges.

Oof, you just made the same mistake that 2016 investors in bitcoin made. The truth is that the process of maintaining that scarcity can be replicated indefinitely.

@_date: 2019-11-25 04:14:45
The store of value argument has little to do with price fluctuations. The liquidity and global access to bitcoin allows someone to store $100k on a device the size of a thumbdrive on a flight from Hong Kong to the United States. There are exchanges and arbitrage traders in both regions, allowing for near equivalent prices, within the average 1% move bitcoin might make on the 12-hour-ish flight.
There are very few things that allow this immediate transfer of value in such a small space. Diamonds and gems also come to mind, but it’s hard to see many other examples.

The best trade you can make is the first one you take when you buy. After that, if you want to increase your amount long term, just sell some 2 days after bitcoin price appears on the news. And then rebuy 2 days after it’s on the news again after a price collapse. Otherwise, you’re trading against algorithmic traders who are very good at what they do.

True that it has zero profits. But there is a real number of dollar bills that were "sold" to exchanges in order to receive bitcoin. Liabilities are arguably zero as open source developers aren't paid for their time, and mining equipment is its own separate business.

Did you anticipate receiving exactly 5.63 before you went to bed? Sometimes I have seen more than I expected sent to my address because of the way bitcoin software uses UtXO or Multisig.

@_date: 2019-10-17 11:39:11
What you're referencing is value investing, whereby company stock tend toward lower P/E ratios, where productive capacity plays a big role. But with index investing and the rise of algorithmic trading, stocks are much more speculative vehicles, as investors buy stocks with the anticipation of making money in the future. Most holders of a 401k cannot list their underlying stock holdings. Is it unsustainable... yes history would say that those market conditions are unsustainable.
So when I meant that the stock market is a proxy for risk and liquidity, I still think it's true for current market conditions, where we are in the last few innings of a bull market. And is especially true when compared to index-based ETFs like the S&amp;P500, which is no doubt a speculative investment even if it's on yearly time frames.

@_date: 2019-06-09 20:11:02
I believe he's actually right. The elliptic curve signing algorithm for LTC is the same as BTC, so since Coinbase has the BTC private key, it can also be used to have access to sign the equivalent LTC address. I know it sounds ridiculous, but the OP got extremely lucky that he happened to send LTC there. Same also applies to Bitcoin Cash, but not to Monero, EOS, XRP, and many others because they have different signing algorithms.

Inflation is just a big as a risk as deflation. In Japan, declining prices means I wont buy a washing machine now if I know it’ll be cheaper tomorrow. This leads to economic slowdown.
Japan came up with monetary solution of simply buying assets in bulk. The United States also did this during the great recession. This leads me to think central banks are more likely to have to deal with a deflationary crisis than an inflationary one.

Everyone has a different opinion for why they think bitcoin is a better form of currency. One of the more common has to do with the act of “quantitative easing” whereby the Federal Reserve buys government bonds to in mass quantities. Its a complicated process that stems from the 2008 crisis, and no one completely understands the impact. Since the Fed members are largely appointed by the government, it is extremely unintuitive to buy your own assets and isnt a free market, where the lender and borrower are independent parties with their own goals. 
You mentioned negative interest rates. In a negative interest rate environment, borrowers are PAID to borrow money. It’s like swiping a credit card and instead of having to pay back the balance with interest, you only have to pay back 95%. This is a great deal for us as borrowers, but the problem is that banks have way more capital than we do and have better access to these loans. Essentially, banks get richer without taking on ANY risk. In an efficient capitalist system, I take a risk on you by loaning you money and hope that you’ll pay me back with interest if you are successful in your business ventures. 
The truth is, no one has any idea how quantitive easing and negative interest rates affect the economy. But both are extremely unintuitive and for many, it smells like a broken system.
I personally think it’s not an immediate problem but a long term one. As a software engineer, who hates that Congress has a lack of interest and care about finance and technology, I think bitcoin is a great asset to own, considering the trade war and china’s rising ability to disrupt our political and financial systems with cyber attacks. But that’s a different discussion!
@_date: 2019-06-09 19:00:38

You have to understand that Bitcoin represents the opposite of the Petro.
@_date: 2019-01-24 15:31:43
Bitcoin is not susceptible to government control, because it resides on every continent on the globe. Specifically which government can ban or alter the source code? We dont have a global government entity in place that can change it, as there will always be a different country that doesnt have the resources to crackdown and/or will encourage its adoption. And taxing your citizens for using it does not affect the chain.
Also, I agree the Petro is not a direct scam. However, Maduro has stated repeatedly that it is backed 1:1 by oil, which is more or less unprovable. Until a state or company or person publicly arrives at the steps of the government and asks for oil in exchange for Petros, this will always be the case. Bitcoin doesnt fall into this category, because it doesnt promise anything.

Your comment about nonces not having to be random was more accurate than this analogy. Miners are guessing millions of random numbers per block. For example, you wouldnt just test your name once and then do nothing for 10 minutes. But you’re right about miners not having to choose uniformly distributed random numbers. For example, I could try the number 1, then the number 2, then 3...
@_date: 2019-01-24 10:11:29
Not really fake news. The subset of acceptable BTC nonces is random for all intents and purposes, but the miners finding solutions to the puzzle dont necessarily have to be random. This is not obvious to many people. Hence the investigation.

As someone who once thought Petro was a good idea, I can point out where you’re incorrect. Bitcoin is not pegged to anything except the free market of supply and demand and the waxing or waning amount of government control of peoples’ access to that free market. It’s not pegged to “your local currency”. If it was pegged to the dollar, the price would be a flat line at $1000 or $10 or whatever price a “central control” would choose. The fact that there is no central control allows for price volatility and an open market place. The trust ultimately comes from the security of open source software and the 10-year ability to not sway from a simple idea of predictable inflation. On the other hand, the petro relies on the promise of Maduro that he will not inflate away the value of his currency by printing more Petros for his cronies or saying that he has more oil than he really has. He has done both things in the past with his Bolivar. With this tie to Maduro, the Petro will continue to be unsuccessful going forward.

But there’s an entire layer underneath where different blockchain assets are traded against bitcoin. The majority of the trading volumes come from algorithms that people have tested to try and turn a profit. For these people, they have no intention to convert to fiat later. They do it to accumulate bitcoin.

Agree. The 2013 crash had a pretty big low just before Tax day as well.

I did some digging. BTCBahamas is apparently an internet and cable provider in the bahamas. Searches must have gone up with the hurricane.

The price of 1 bitcoin is the dollar amount in the $10,000 range and is what appears when you go to the Bitcoin section on coinbase. If you keep your own bitcoin off coinbase, you should always know how much bitcoin you have (ex: 0.15 would be $1,500).

Undoubtedly. 3K is the precise number that will need to be reached and you saw it first.

May be that VPN usage routes through different countries. Or maybe googling from a smartphone doesn't provide accurate IP information, which is the primary way to determine the location of a query.

No you’re playing against an AI algorithm on liquid exchanges. There are sophisticated methods out there that look at liquidity pools and fine tune when a human is about to start a trade. You are bait if you think technical indicators give you an upper hand. The only advantage that you have as a human is looking at yearly trends on the log chart or being able to investigate safe storage of your assets.

Love this chart. If you’ll notice, it oscillates between very fast spikes and slow rising crescendos (like the last one). If the last and final run-up is a spike, it is similar to global fear events like gold rocketing prior to the 2008 financial crisis and will have the same order of magnitude (~$1trillion)

How does the current state relate to the total btc transacted per day? If the 38.6 btc is just a snapshot at a single point in time, then the daily btc should be much more correct?

In speculative markets, movements can be very unexpected. The shares of Amazon continued to decline even after the tech bubble popped and Amazon began to grow rapidly.
