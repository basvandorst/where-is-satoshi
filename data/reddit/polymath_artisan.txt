A few other edits to add:
Blockchain is one word.
BCH is the right ticker but Binance uses BCC which is a little confusing.
If you can, try to add in some visual representations of the blockchain. It takes people time to understand what it is and how it works. I've found visuals tend to aide the learning process.
I might get some hate for this one, but remove 'greatest' before cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is great. It makes up the majority of my portfolio. However, the goal of an informational brochure is to give people the facts and not your opinion on it. You creating the brochure conveys your interest and belief in the currency and that alone will inspire them.
BTC is a cryptographically secure digital asset. Be prepared to explain to them a little bit about public and private keys and why that makes it secure. Just saying 'it's secure' sounds like 'trust me, i know things'.
Either remove 'basically' or replace it with 'in other words'. Basically can come across as a little condescending. It's already a complex enough idea to wrap one's head around and you want them to feel supported in their learning.
Under 'Why should I care about BTC?', again, remove your feelings about it and give them the facts. BTC *can* be a better way to use money. It is the next generation of financial technology. Humans went from a barter system, to gold system, to gold backed fiat system, to faith backed fiat system, to a cryptographically secure and internationally agreed upon consensus system. (There are other ways to word this, but I think it gets my point across) Also, it is a global currency, people use it around the world. It just hasn't replaced a national currency yet. No one knows if or when that will happen though so I encourage you to leave out the 'highly probable'. 
Make it clear that the price does fluctuate. 'At the time of this writing, 1BTC = $8700 USD'. This could be a good spot to add another visual with showing the historical price chart to help your audience grasp the magnitude of the adoption rate over even just the most recent year. You can also pull some quotes from some big financial talking heads showing their new acceptance of the currency becoming a viable option.
Leave out that estimates of the $500k in ten years or provide them with a source.
Under 'How is BTC better/different than cash', take out 'not prone to inflation' and replace it with 'the government can not print more bitcoin'. Remove the 'it's a better way to use money'. As of right now, it's great to use as an investment vehicle or for large purchases. However, it makes more sense to use Litecoin for smaller transactions. Your goal here is to give them the full picture and where it is and is not useful. Visa clears 4k transactions every second. Bitcoin clears around 7 until lightning network gets implemented.
How it's made is mostly on target. I would probably go back and reword it a little bit. Your explanation makes it sound like the old days where anyone could participate in mining and that's no longer true. There are a lot of politics involved in the mining sphere right now as well.
You could add in that almost anyone can run a node.
Take out the warning. Educate your audience about what a fork is, why it happened, and leave your feelings about it out of the conversation. After they've done more research and understand what bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are, then you can enter into heated debates citing facts about why one is better over the other. This is another good place to put in a visual of the original blockchain with forked side chains coming off of it.
Good job! It's great to see people trying to find ways to bring people into the bitcoin and the cryptosphere! It's an important technology for people to understand and it's certainly changing the landscape of the current financial industry. :)

thank you, good sir!
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:56:47
Hey! Yeah of course. Here are my comments:
**What is Bitcoin?**
Insert: which is a 'cryptographically secure' digital asset....exchange. 'It eliminates the need for an intermediary, such as a bank.'
**Why should I care about BTC?**
Feel free to reword this and shorten it.. "Bitcoin is the next step in the evolution of money and it's important to learn about the technology behind this new revolution. Over the past year, bitcoin has overcome its negative 'Silk road, bad internet money' stereotypes because people are starting to understand how important blockchain (immutable ledger) technology is.  Bitcoin is a global currency and although it has not replaced any national currency yet, its not impossible that it won't.
The increased interest and adoption has also led the price to rise dramatically over the past year. From $600 to over $8900 as on November 2017."
**How are Bitcoins made?**
'Bitcoins are produced each time a miner completes a complex mathematical problem. By solving this complex mathematical problem the miner is able to add the next 'block' to the blockchain. This part of bitcoin takes time to understand so don't worry if it doesn't make sense immediately. If you would like to learn more please visit:  
**How does Bitcoin work?**
'Bitcoin works by using a network of volunteer computers known as "nodes". These nodes carry bitcoin's entire blockchain history and are used to verify current transactions sent across the network. The more nodes there are, the faster transactions can be verified. The good news is you can participate! If you have enough storage space on your computer (the current chain is about 145 gigabytes) and your computer is able to stay on, you can run your own node. This is not necessary and the vast majority of bitcoin users do not run their own node.'
**How do I receive and send Bitcoin?**
'You must first create a bitcoin wallet - there are many wallets available for you to download on either your computer, smartphone, or online. Hardware (among the safest) wallets are also available. To receive a bitcoin you need a public address that you can share with someone, just like how you would give your address to someone who wants to send you a piece of mail. It's works the same way to send bitcoin, but instead you send it to their address. 
Bitcoin works using public/private key cryptography and it's very important that you never share your private key with anyone. It would be like giving away the password to your safe!'
I like the "KEEP YOUR PRIVATE KEY SAFE..." bit. Definitely keep that in there.
**Change to: What is a Bitcoin fork?**
'You may or may not have heard the buzzword 'fork' in the news. A bitcoin fork happens when a small group of people decide they want to make a change to the code and the rest of the community does not want to make the change. The small group copies the existing code and then chooses to fork the network. This causes no damage to the original chain and will not affect the coins you own.
This happened twice in 2017, though it is not typically common.'
Keep the ticker names in there! Those are great. 
Best of luck! Feel free to shoot me a tip if you use the suggestions. :)

Agreed. The amount of research being done concerning bitcoin is astounding and global. Other cryptos have promising technology as well but bitcoin is becoming tangible to the masses and has first mover advantage. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:36:11
I've been looking into it since I started in with bitcoin back in May/June of this year but haven't committed just yet. What kind of mini computer did you get, if you don't mind my asking? 
Also, I'm not a coder so I've been a little hesitant purely from lack of knowledge/confidence in setting one up.

Do some serious research into bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Read the whitepapers of multiple to gauge what they are and which ones you believe in (if you decide you believe in any). Read news articles as well to learn about current events. Only then can you make an informed decision about whether or not it’s something you want to invest your money in. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:38:58
I don’t think mentioning an alt of bitcoin would open the doors to all the other coins. It’s directly related. If a person gets preachy about said alt, result of bitcoin fork, then it would make sense to remove the post. Seems healthy to allow someone the opportunity to learn about why core is better.

From u/turtlecupcakes
“Running a node is just listening for other nodes to pass you data, checking that its valid, and passing it in further. So a peer will tell you "block 12345573 has parent x, is at height y, has transactions a,b,and c, its nonce is 73626 and its hash is a6h54fwj". When you run a node, your job is to just check that those details are valid and that the hash lines up and to pass that data onto anyone else that might not know it yet.
When you're mining, you're listening for new transactions, so some random peer will tell you "x wants to send y btc to z, here's his signature ". And as a miner your job is to collect a few if these, add in the other data above (parent block), and randomly append millions of possible nonces until the resulting hash follows the rules of the bitcoin network. Once you have that hash, you transmit that block back to regular nodes to further distribute around the network.”
Hope this helps!

Did you read the sidebar?
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:01:48
Well, if people didn't pay attention to the devs and the devs obvioulsy knew what they were doing then why would there have needed to be a split to create bcash in the first place? People paid attention and there were some who didn't agree with the direction it was moving in. Blindly following anything will get you nowhere.
Products that you use for work are developed by companies. You typically purchase or subscribe to said product and sign something with fine print saying that the product will work a certain way or you and it will interact in a certain way otherwise there will be repercussions. 
This sub is for bitcoin discussions though and not bcash defenses. I think may be a better spot for you to continue what has become a debate.

You should definitely consider diversifying just a little bit. It’s sounds like you’re young so starting over wouldn’t be difficult but it wouldn’t hurt to move 20% of your investments into a Roth IRA or traditional savings account. You never know when rainy days are going to hit.

That’s the thing though. It’s not that we both found a ‘bitcoin’ that works for each of us. You have found an altcoin that you like, but it is not Bitcoin. I gather from your other post that you aren’t a programmer  but do you understand what a hard fork is?
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:46:29
What I meant with part of bitcoin is that it takes strong consensus to make a big change or improvement to the codebase which is important when the codebase makes up a $100bn market cap. Destroying trust by forking off too often could lead people to lose faith in this as a viable alternative to fiat. Again, if you want to use bcc then by all means, use your free will and do so. 
From what I gather, you came into this sub with the assumption that we would tear you down as evidenced by ‘consider this a test’. Why not just join and ask a question and see what happens? Come prepared with knowledge, evidence and an open mind and see what kind of information you can learn and share. It’s like easing into any community, it takes time and understanding. Only then can you decide what your judgement will be.

Except he would have control over the decisions he makes for the business and if it failed he would have sole ownership for why it happened. This is betting the markets. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:35:01
You could use ETH or IOTA or NEO and like what they do for you but that doesn’t make them bitcoins. Bitcoin is the main blockchain and bcash split off from the chain using the same codebase that they then made alterations to. I’m not judging you for liking to use bcash. It’s not up to me to decide your tastes and preferences. However it is important to understand that it is not bitcoin. 
I recommend reading through the blockgeeks article I posted as it’s unbiased and full of great information if you’re new to the space. It’ll make more sense once you understand what a fork is.

So bitcoin will always have to work in harmony with fiat? How would one build a credit score in a bitcoin only environment?

Are miners randomly selected to have "mined" the coin? As I understand, they are running through calculations to solve the hash function and whoever solves it first gets the coin.

I agree. I don’t think we’re quite at the tipping point yet where people take it seriously versus dismissing it as “crazy internet money”. It’s changing as this sub has grown by 100,000 since I joined 6 months ago but people are still just beginning to dip their toes in, if at all.

ETH used proof of work and is transitioning to proof of stake. Where are you getting your information from? There seem to be a few large holes in your knowledge base. 
Can you explain what blockchain technology is or is this purely a speculative asset for you?
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:52:52
So right here is why I question your statements. You previously stated that you didn’t have time to learn about ETH or any other altcoin for that matter and then you state that ETH is another speculative blockchain. If you haven’t read anything about ETH how can you state with confidence that it is speculative only? This type of reasoning is misguided and just flat out wrong.

It was partly sarcastic. A fair number of friends are devs and PMs at startups and the bigger companies and live very well on their six figure salaries. It’s all relative regardless. Some of them do spend and some of them don’t. For some it’s what they project their future earnings to be. Keep in mind I said 25, not 45. Many spend a lot when they have no dependents and then priorities change and adjustments are made.

Part of Bitcoin is also community which is why Segwit required 95% approval before being implemented whereas bcash just split off. I agree with the above that it will be a very interesting experiment.

Spend some time doing some research and deciding where you want to invest and why you want to invest your money there. Asking communities for their opinion if you can’t offer anything in return isn’t going to get you anywhere. There is LOADS of information available out there. Everyone else who invested smartly did their due diligence and researched their investment options. This kind of general question begs for sarcastic responses.

You can cash out but you’ll also pay capital gains taxes. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:21:32
What I’m saying is that you’re argument is circular in nature. To say you don’t need to pay attention to the devs because they know what they are doing is to say everything always goes the way everyone wants it to go. However, if that were the case, bcash would never have split off because the original chain would have served everyone perfectly well and there would be no need to change it. 
There are many cryptos that copied the original BTC code and then modified it to fit their wants or what they viewed as improvements. Does that make them all bitcoin? Of course not. They are now alt coins. That’s also what bcash did. It’s a copied and then modified version of the BTC codebase but once something forks off the main chain it becomes an alt coin. A lot of the uproar about bcash’s name is because it confuses new folks.
