It wasn't a joke at all; Shepard constantly told the audience to investigate Bitcoin for themselves, he mentioned its various uses (both legal and illegal), and he didn't drown on about Winklevii. It was a great interview. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 08:05:22
I would stalk Reddit for those commenters (you know the ones) who see someone use the bitcoinbot and go, "Wait, what did you just do?"
Then I would tip them a single bitcoin, which creates both a wallet for them and an incentive for them to further investigate Bitcoin. I could wrangle in 100 new Bitcoin users this way, and the value would be high enough that they would be emotionally invested in understanding Bitcoin.
In the end, I'd be out 100BTC, but Bitcoin would continue to flourish as more and more Redditors embrace it as the future!!! I can't think of a brighter one. =)
@_date: 2013-08-27 06:39:30
It's not a contradiction, as only one of them actually involves you *spending* money:
In the huge buy example, you're buying at market price (as this whale did) which drives the price up. 
In the second example where you create huge fake buy walls, you simply give off the impression that there's a ground-swelling of support, that everyone wishes they could have bought cheaper...it's a psychological trick that makes it seem impossible or at least improbable that Bitcoin will drop that low again. So the outcome is the same, but the trader doesn't actually have to spend a dime! Others do all the buying for him (increasing the price) because they think the price "can only go up" (due to his big buy walls). 
Does that make sense? One is a direct transfer of funds, the second is some subtle manipulation.

The value of bitcoin (in the present) is according to the exchanges. You can claim that it's a ton less or more, but if you try to sell a single bitcoin for $2,000 you're going to struggle.

@_date: 2013-08-31 19:36:11
I'm so sick of this cop-out. Every single other exchange on the market is also increasing. If people were "cashing out" of Mt. Gox, they'd be selling elsewhere and the price difference would continue to grow exponentially. That's not at ALL what's happening, every single other exchange has grown (albeit slightly behind) alongside Mt. Gox.
Liquidity problems don't exist on the other exchanges, so we would be seeing their price drop drastically if people were *only* buying to get out of Mt. Gox. That's simply not happening.

Fake walls disappear quickly after they incentivize the market in one direction or another. They also disappear when the orders get close so they don't accidentally sell or buy when all they wanted to do was influence.
@_date: 2013-06-01 06:13:50
Orders are filled incrementally; so if someone wanted to sell 100BTC at $127, it would drop from 8,000 to 7,900. If someone wanted to sell 9,000 BTC, it would drop all 7,900 from this whale and then continue to chip at others beneath him/her.
Does that make sense?

Look at the high...it hit $133 (just like the title says and the picture shows). 
@_date: 2013-08-27 06:05:41
You could easily make individual small sell walls instead of buying 13k BTC at one time. You're describing an intelligent trader who foresees Mt. Gox's demise. Someone who buys 13k BTC at one time is *not* an intelligent trader unless they're shorting or "going long". 
In both cases they're expecting the price to skyrocket. 
@_date: 2013-08-27 05:45:22
After an insane 13k+ BTC buy (~$1.5+ million USD) on Mt. Gox, Bitcoin's value has skyrocketed to $133 for the first time since May 26th, 2013. 
BitcoinAverage's value (including Bitstamp, BTC-E, and others) is now at $127+, seen here: 
@_date: 2013-08-27 05:53:43
Nah, that'd be followed by huge losses elsewhere as he/she tries to take advantage of overall higher prices. Additionally, buying it all in a bulk 13k BTC buy is NOT the sign of a smart trader trying to sneakily escape Mt. Gox with the most profit possible.
A 13k BTC buy all at once says only one thing: someone considered it a steal and wants to get in before the price jumps even higher. I'm guessing insider trading after today's meeting with the regulators, must have been some seriously good news.

I said "start of a bubble". I really don't understand how you can't understand that. Do you think a bubble suddenly materializes $500 higher than the current price? No, it has to rise there first. I'm calling this as that rise, sheesh.

@_date: 2013-08-27 06:20:13
I specifically said it was the start of a new bubble, not its peak. I think this bubble will go well over $1,000 based on the past patterns. We went from $2 to $30, then to $266, then to...what? My best guess is well over $1,000.
@_date: 2013-06-16 22:19:08
That is a good sign, indeed...I'm super surprised!
@_date: 2013-08-15 05:13:53

@_date: 2013-08-27 07:50:45
You can't buy 13k on BitStamp because you'd have immediate "slippage" (but upwards). There isn't any sorts of walls you could eat into at all, you'd be buying at $145 in no time instead of $125. Gox has the most volume, period, and it's where the whales have to play if they want to make large transactions. 
@_date: 2013-08-27 06:08:14
If that's your opinion, then I can't argue that or change your mind. As for myself, I'm extremely bullish after a steady incline from $60 to $133 in less than two months. 
I wish the best of luck to you. =)

@_date: 2013-06-16 20:59:53
Interesting...so if it is a DDoS, it's targeting the servers somehow instead of using tons of tiny transactions. Or Mt. Gox is just borked for some reason.
I'm still confused as to why we wouldn't be able to log in, though, as that doesn't seem like a function that would be delegated to the same servers as transactions. Maybe no transactions are occurring because everyone was immediately logged out and can't get back in...

A bubble has a beginning, peak, and pop. This is the beginning.
You're welcome to argue semantics all you want. Bitcoin value has increased from $60 to $133 in 1.5 months, that's a fact. I believe it will go higher, that's an opinion. 
I'm predicting the price to go up by calling the *beginning* of a bubble, which means the price will skyrocket, peak, and then pop down to a level higher than the last bubble's low (as has shown in the past for BTC).

Statement Regarding OKPay Integration
Tokyo, Japan, May 28th, 2013 - Mt. Gox has recently been informed by OKPay, one of 
our longtime partners, that they are planning to stop performing wire transfers to and from 
all Bitcoin exchanges, including Mt. Gox. 
OKPay is offering a solution, but in the meantime we want to make sure that Mt. Gox 
customers and the Bitcoin community are well-informed about this development. While 
we are not completely clear about the dates of the transition, we would like to make a 
couple of points clear:
•We will soon stop accepting deposits via OKPay. This may take up to a couple of 
weeks, but it will happen eventually. 
•Withdrawals to OKPay accounts will not be cut immediately, but will only be 
allowed up to the amount that OKPay users have deposited into Mt. Gox via 
OKPay. Beyond that amount there are other methods of withdrawal available. 
Mt. Gox wishes the best to OKPay, and we look forward to working together more closely 
in the future. The Bitcoin economy is going through many changes recently, and we are 
positive that they will ultimately work themselves out in the best interests of the 
community and the World.

That's exactly what others said when we jumped from $70 to $90, from $95 to $110, from $115 to $122, and from there up to $133.
The price is 220% what it was at its recent low in July, what's it going to take before people start admitting that the price is rising fast?

@_date: 2013-08-27 06:29:17
Bubbles increase media visibility and make Bitcoin a household name. In the long term, Bitcoin will stabilize once it reaches its true value. In the meantime, look at bubbles as opportunities, as each one levels off higher than the previous one.
Look at how many Bitcoin startups and companies there are now compared to before the April bubble, for instance. Bubbles are phenomenal for garnering tons of attention, and each Bitcoin bubble so far has left the price much higher than before the bubble started.

Bubbles have three parts. You've completely ignored that over and over, you don't want to argue "how words work", you only want to focus on the final stage of a bubble, as if it has no rise or peak. Sorry, but I don't feel like pretending bubbles only go down. They have to go up before they go down, and that's what I'm calling.
You don't want a conversation, you want to nitpick my vernacular to death, and honestly, I've got better things to do than have a random redditor tell me how to use market terms correctly.

Uh...that's not the only way value works, dude. If someone sells a bitcoin for $133 on Mt. Gox, it was worth (value) $133. Period. You don't get to tell them it wasn't worth that, they didn't need your definition of value in order to say it was worth $133 to them, mkay?

@_date: 2013-08-27 06:27:20
I never claimed to be a good trader, there's no need to mock me. 
I haven't contradicted myself at all. If a single whale is jumping out, he knows that the speculation was dependent on his actions and will therefore stop shortly after (which means a drop in price back to where it was stable before his huge buy). The last thing he would do is sit and hold if he *knew* that the value was not worth its current price. 
Smart traders don't play games with their money, they don't make a huge buy "hoping" it'll go up higher. If he wanted to prop the price up, he could make a ton of fake buy walls to imitate great support. Actually spending his cash would be a terrible idea. 
@_date: 2013-08-27 07:51:53
Yeah, calling it a bubble makes it sound like I'm calling the price as too high, which isn't accurate. I'm saying a new bubble is starting that's gonna kick the price sky high before it pops again, and this time it'll stay much higher.

I definitely agree with your analysis; there is so much more positivity in the market than there was in the latter half of April and all of May, June, and July. You can see that, too, by the buying pressure that is mounting on Mt. Gox (
Personally, I think we're at the very, very early stages of the next bubble forming. So many companies are starting to accept Bitcoin, new startups are being funded, and others like Gyft are thriving. 
Additionally, Bloomberg is about to add a Bitcoin ticker...expect prices to EXPLODE once the larger financial markets hear tale of an upcoming undervalued technology. It will be difficult to hold all the dolla dolla bills, y'all. 
Edit: Immediately after I comment, there's another 2.5k BTC buy on Mt. Gox. Just saying, the desire to buy is there.

And for those who will quickly say that "Gox doesn't count," take a look at [BitcoinAVerage]( 
Short answer is that Mt. Gox accounts for 75% of all major BTC exchange transactions in the past 24 hours. If you want to ignore 75% of the market, that's your poor choice, but the fact remains that the average price of all major BTC exchanges is $115 (with the high of $120 on Mt. Gox).

@_date: 2013-08-27 06:13:33
Personally, I see BTC as worth more than $1,000 apiece. Anything less than that is a great purchase, in my opinion. As for what makes it worth that value, I believe its incredible ability to cross country's borders without massive fees is its best strong point. That, combined with its natural deflation effect, make for a potent mix.
When BTC was $0.05, others mocked the idea of it being worth a dollar. I've made the conscious decision not to be in the crowd of scoffers as its value continues to soar. =)

It should never tip the same user twice, simple enough. That way its range continues to grow without anyone being able to game the system (outside of creating extra accounts).
You could also guard against new accounts (created just to get the tips) by only picking users who were a few months old.

You're right, dang, we'll just all stop buying and using them now. Thanks for setting us straight!

This is going to cause a HUGE crash once it's sorted out. =(

For any actual reason or just because you enjoy hating things that aren't bitcoin?

That was a $1.6 million USD buy all at once. That's not the sign of someone getting out; if you were trying to get out, you would want to slowly sell so as not to cause slippage or price jumps. If you bought all at once so you could get your BTC out, you'd risk the price skyrocketing (like it did) alongside your buys.
No way that was someone trying to get out, or the other exchanges would be tanking from the simultaneous sell orders as he/she tries to take advantage of higher prices all around.
I said it when we hit $90, and I'll say it again $43 higher and later...this is the next bubble.

"Bubble law", rofl. Like Bitcoin follows your traditional "market laws". Bitcoin was up 5,320% in two years, I really don't think it gives a rip about your "laws", mate.
Everyone keeps claiming this is "just the old bubble popping." That might have been true at $60, but you're going to be hard-pressed to keep saying that as the price keeps doubling. 
But you know what? It's your choice based on your opinion. Mine is based on the fact that the price has increased 120% in 1.5 months. I don't see that as "bubble popping" behavior, but you might feel differently.
