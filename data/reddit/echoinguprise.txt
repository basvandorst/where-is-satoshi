Seems other sites are following suit!

Isn't there really not any bitcoin apps for the phone anyway?

Be even better if everyone actually claimed the currency!

That is actually very surprising. Considering Google owns Youtube.

Interesting! I will have to look into that some more.

Do not get me started on that. One of the worst decisions I have ever seen. Still a good bit of youtubers have their comments completely disabled on their videos.

Regardless if it is in the bitcoin industry or another industry, any company that just completely ignores its customers and leaves them in the dark all the time will eventually fail. I would say this is even more so when you are dealing with people's money.

See this happening all too common, in many different companies. Higher ups refuse to change how business is done and adapt to the new world, which eventually leads to their demise.

Can we you interest you in our credit card today?

True, but he does have a valid point. Any government wise is slow and ha so many hoops to jump through its crazy. With bitcoin, new features and fixes can be pushed out rather quickly. This is true with most software though.

Probably not. I am sure it is in their TOS that they can remove an app for whatever reason at anytime.

That does not necessarily work well in the business world unless you have the cash reserves to work with. Generally in the business world you want to instantly convert those Bitcoins to cash so you can actually fund your business's needs. Last I heard you can't pay your electric bill with bitcoin.

More and more dealerships!

They have long since been the best. I think more people are becoming informed about them and are no longer giving them any power.

I wish I had that much BTC.
