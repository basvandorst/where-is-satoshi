Burned the physical cash, issue tradable token that is pegged with dollar value. 
Company will take some fees. I don't want cash to be stored by the company, it's subject to theft, I want to it to be flamed immediately and destroy it forever in that way the digital token that I received will be always legit.

I don't like localbitcoin, buying BTC is unreliable and expensive there. 
if your account is freeze by banks how would you trade. You don't expect me to go out on street with my cash and begged for exchange  Currently  there are thousands of traders whose bank accounts are locked. 
I just wish that there exist some companies that will burn  physical cash and issue tradable  tokens based on burned value that is pegged with dollar.

We are trading decentralize coins on centralize exchange. When the community is going to embrace decentralize exchange?  Bitfinex is running fractional reserve system by issuing their own USDT(tether). Decentralize coins were suppose to liberate people by taking power from the government into people's hand. Now it seems rather power is shifted into greedy corporate hands. I'm extremely worried about the direction we are heading.

Yes, literally burn it with fire and issue tradable token that is pegged against dollar so token doesn't fluctuate too much.

I've to totally agree with you. 
Adding my own additional opinion, Roger Ver, greedy exchange and corrupt media is deadlier than Chinese Government. Chinese Government have lot's of deadlier weapons buy they don't have any weapon against Bitcoin. All they could do it shut down the exchange and hopelessly watch it rise in value again.
Roger Ver has illicit weapon to fight against Bitcoin and sadly it carries the same name. Most of the exchange and media can be easily sold to manipulate public perception. Look at the current news, 'Bitcoin Jesus', 'Bitcoin bubble' and all the crappy things.
When Roger ver was actually in the Bitcoin Core team, bitcoin community trusted them and put lot's of investment now egoist, self interested Roger ver want the Bitcoin holder to loose their money.  There is no need for that, he could have made more money by creating another coin and name it something else, look at the Litecoin. 
There is a reason Chinese Government targeted Bitcoin. It is father of all the cryptocurriencies out there. All are powered by similar same underlying blockchain concept technology. So if somehow Bitcoin can be killed than it's possible to kill all the cryptocurriencies out there. Roger Ver tactics by manipulating market, exchange will be felt by all cryptocurriencies. There will be tremendous  loss of trust among investors. We can see this already happening. 
I believe in future bitcoin cash will fall, because most people will associate it with corruption, public perception manipulation, corrupt exchange(look at coinbase). More importantly, if bitcoin cash was traded in regulated stock market than Roger Ver would be in a jail by now. So in future there is a high probability that Roger Ver will go to jail.

What do you expect from them? They are businessmen and monopolistic by nature. Pure monopolistic businessmen cannot imagine the world in open and decentralize way. If they do than they are suffering from Split\-Brain Syndrome.  We should just ignore them and learn from Satoshi Nakamoto , he/she/they is/are good example of  decentralize leadership.

Where did Satoshi Nakamoto mentioned "scaled by log N"?

Go to [
and click at the bottom right corner show script and coinbase, All the valid signature previous owner and  redeem script are contained inside input script. I don't have time to dig on how it looks but the only way to verify the given address is segwit is through redeems script. The quickest way to check whether the given address is segwit or not is from here [ You need to look for a ways to execute input script of a current transaction with previous transaction output script.

If it's a segwit address why are some people suggesting to look at derived path m/49'/0'/0'/0/0. From [  it's derived path starts at m/0/0. Segwit address is Bip141. I'm 100&amp; percent this puzzle address is segwit. I look at it's previous address, they are all segwit. I used this website [

You shouldn't call this FUD. For the benefit of overall crypto community  it's was legitimate and reasonable question to ask whether each TETHER is backed by dollar or not. It's better to avoid disaster early. I'm extremely worried about TETHER, they have failed to provide an open audit, if they really have cash stashed somewhere, they should have already proved us all wrong. Why the nonsense DRAMA? Look at the Bitgrail hack case, they created lot's of nonsense DRAMA(verification required, withdrawal limit etc.) to cover their track.

I agree, Government doesn't have control over it's censorship and permissionless system but they do have control over it's price. Bitcoin price is extremely volatile and single news from Government could potentially wiped out billions of dollars. It was meant to liberate us from Corrupt Government but the same Government has found a weapon, spreading FUD through media, to manipulate it's price. If somebody wants to send me remittance through Bitcoin and I'm paying 50%  of it for my son school tuition fee and 50% for my  rent, if the price falls 20% within few minutes there is no way I could cover all my cost, either we'll be homeless or my son will be out from school. I just wish it was more resistance to FUD but FUD exist in human mind, it's a human weakness, so I would not ever expect Bitcoin price to be stable nor I'll accept it as remittance.
