would you be willing to donate to the **National Kidney Foundation**? There are millions of people worldwide who are suffering renal failure. Thank you.

I don't think he hired them...


If they don't understand how the currency works...

That's your refer link, isn't it?
I believe that breaks the Fifth Element: "No referral links in submissions." Or, "Leeloo Dallas Multipass."

Isn't 0.5 mBTC about... under 45 cents?
@_date: 2017-01-05 04:30:22


Is that 45% on an annualized basis, or are banks actually earning 45 yuan for every 100 yuan lent out overnight and returned the next day?!?

Cash out at least half. Then visit r/personalfinance anonymously. Diversification is something former Enron employees wish they had done.

Lucky you! Unless you sold when it was also $10...
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:03:28
Now at $89.

Bad answer. That's the same logic as 100 yen. The value in dollars might drop but OP still has 100 yen.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:05:45
Good call. Now $100. What's your next prediction?
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:08:43
Where is the next bubble forming?

I fully regret not getting into bitcoins when it was $25.
Alas, I don't even know how to get started. And if I were to start now, I'd be afraid of a "crash" like that.

Wait, these things have absurdly low yields. You think confidence in the dollar will be lost soon?
