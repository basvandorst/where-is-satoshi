Hello /r/ bitcoin!
I am a newbie to Bitcoin. After exploring it a bit, I felt like it would not be a good payment solution for my company. Please examine  my company's situation, and offer feedback on why I should use bitcoin if possible. I appreciate the support!
I work for a major regional Bank/Sub Prime Lender finance corporation. I am in charge of vendor relations, as well as application development/IT. I am capable of implementing Bitcoin payments as apart of our business, exposing 50,000 customers with an option to pay in bitcoin. We have tons of technology projects to implement, and little time to get to all of them. High level executives see excepting payments from Bitcoin is a risk. New things = risk. If it turns out there aren't any users that pay in bitcoin, it would mean I have wasted valuable resources on a completely useless project that was a risk to begin with.. Bad bad!
I see a lot of statistics saying merchants are not getting customers who want to pay in bitcoin. Please help to convince me this isn't true! We use services like credit card payments, debit card payments, bank payments (ACH), moneygram, and phone payments. Our customers are subprime, mostly people who are having a hard time keeping up with their bills and not the best credit.
Now, my problem is- We hate paying vendors. BTC is no vendor, it is an open source technology. Thus, BTC would give us savings, but noone uses it! Noone actually pays with it! What do we do?
