Lol if bitcoin ever becomes the global reserve currency, you can count on the existing wealthy owning all of it. Happy 4th tho

$30 can be earned in 2-3 hours at most minimum wage jobs, which can then be converted into bitcoin easily and quickly. The prospect of being paid in bitcoin does not eclipse the fact that you are getting paid the spot exchange price - that is, below minimum wage - to take online surveys. This is awful advice and just about the degree of stupidity I’ve come to expect from bitcoin forums lol

What an absolutely idiotic comment by people who have no idea what they’re talking about—so just about perfect for this sub (and no, I’m not a computer scientist, I work in finance).

If bitcoin ever becomes a significant asset class, people will own it through electronic ETF’s and the like - exactly as they do real gold. Bitcojn’s scarcity is a far greater value proposition than its decentralization.

Thank you for the one of the first insightful comments I’ve read on this subreddit in weeks. Seems like you have a life and interests outside of posting on r/Bitcoin 20 times a day

1) A very hard question to answer and admittedly one that nobody can tell for certain.
2) This is behavioral economics at work. Your average buy in price should have no bearing on whether you continue to hold a security or not.
3) This is the same mentality HODLer idiots had when they held their positions from $20k to $3k. NEWS FLASH!!! ZOOM OUT!!! We are 18 months post-ATH, in a more conducive macro environment, and bitcoin’s price is &lt;1/2 of that at ATH
4) Because supports do matter; not every $500 loss is comparable. For the first time in several months bitcoin is displaying a bearish trend. We went from lower highs and higher low’s (convergent triangle) to lower high’s and lower low’s. 
Good luck
Edit: wow I’ve really triggered some people. You guys must be VERY confident in your trades if you’re allowing a couple comments to upset you this much. Yikes

I’ll do it at a 3% markup, under the same terms.

Coinbase and any other exchange worth using log trades automatically and provide 13F. Who cares

Your tax burden isn’t increasing in number of trades; it only matters when selling an asset less than a year out vs. more than a year out. It’s a proportion of profit for the marginal trade on a short-dated basis. Good god you people are morons.

Comments like these remind me of how uneducated and poorly adjusted the members of this community are. Do you not think rich people already exist today? TIL every Ferrari owner is at serious risk of being tortured and killed LMAO.

I like bitcoin but you have a severely myopic view of macro. Quantitative easing has been going on for the last 10 years. The value of the dollar actually rose today. To suggest fiat will be irrelevant in 10 years when it is backed by trillions of dollars in hard assets that the government commands - both military and otherwise - is idiocy. Please refrain from speaking with authority on topics you clearly know nothing about
P.S. two questions for you since you seem to be so confident in your view of the world. Do you really think monetary policy for a sovereign nation should be determined democratically? And do you have any evidence that inflation has occurred at higher than the reported rates (which fall below 2% per annum)?

The trend is broken. You all sound like idiots when you blindly shout HODL. Cut your losses and get back in at a lower price.

Respect for being in this longer than me or 99% of the idiots on this sub, but to call fiat a fraud is a bit sensationalist. No currency purports to be infinitely secure. The USD for example is only secured by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. What exactly is fraudulent about that? Only governments can be fraudulent. Fiat by definition is not.
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:15:22
USD is only rare to the extent that it is backed by the US government. That doesn’t make it a fraud, nor is printing money as a stimulative measure. If you don’t understand basic monetary theory, you shouldn’t feel so comfortable opining on whether fiat currencies are fraudulent (hint: they’re not).
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:37:00
What currency did you use to buy your bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:28:54
Agreed. Those who can’t, teach. Those who can’t reach, write books.
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:31:03
good logic. $1 worth of BTC in 2009 would also be worth hundreds of thousands today. Better not tell anyone I have $1. Doh!
@_date: 2019-05-25 03:36:05
this was the post that caused me to unsub. thanks
