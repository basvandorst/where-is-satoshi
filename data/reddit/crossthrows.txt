Bitcoin is at 3700!

“Younger demographics seem most inclined to buy bitcoin”
Yeah because older people don’t want to invest their money into a more risky portfolio.
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:17:34
One could argue the worse a currency smells the better it is.
@_date: 2019-07-20 20:41:49
Can’t wait to see 11,000 tomorrow!

@_date: 2019-07-20 22:14:25
Hmm. What makes you say that?
@_date: 2019-07-20 23:50:40
Why did bitcoin suddenly shoot back down after hitting 11k?
@_date: 2019-07-21 01:06:22
I'm new to this. So I'm assuming you're talking about the halving?
@_date: 2019-07-20 13:43:27
Bull market. It’s going to rise to ath+ then sink back low to bear. It’s not going to drop below 9k because *ITS OVER 9000*. No because it hasn’t seen that low in a month and it’s in bullish.

They’re just jealous they don’t have as much interest in getting into bitcoin.

“The next bitcoin” if there will be one is most likely ethereum. However, there most likely will NOT be a “next bitcoin”.
@_date: 2019-08-06 17:35:17
Great time to buy!

Realistically speaking what kind of gains would a person expect to see on the value of their bitcoin investing now compared to investing 8 years ago.
