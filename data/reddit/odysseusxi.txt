Like i said above, just be fluid. Don't let things you don't like affect you negatively.

So my first big run in with FUD was the Mike Hearn Rage quit. After reading his letter I was very close to selling, but kind of convinced myself that he would be wrong? luckily!
Admittedly, I went through a phase of 'something better will come around' (faster etc.,) and drank the ETH kool aid in 2016. Made a bit of money from it but not as much as I should have considering how early I got in. Same story with Monero... I kept coming back to BTC though. I suppose out of all the information and fors/ againsts I had digested over the years, the thing that stuck by me the most, was not the currency abilities of BTC, but its network effect/ longest chain and thus store of value feature that would be a natural outcome.
* I'm probably more certain than ever that it's BTC or bust (as in it wont be another crypto).
* I believe Rogers heart is in the right place, but he is just wrong. I still have my BCH from the split but I'm confident that it poses like less than 1% chance of 'replacing' btc.
* I think it's super important to be as fluid as possible in terms of not getting emotionally attached to a point of view/ coin/ argument whatever... hear all sides, and even if you're fully convinced of something, prepare for the opposite to happen as well.
* It's very hard to accept that BTC has a decent to good chance of succeeding on a scale we don't even know yet - but it does. I think we naturally safeguard our expectations and expect stuff to fail. Many times in the past I have almost been waiting and subconsciously almost wanting bad enough news to get out of BTC. It's hard to explain, but there is like a weird stress I've felt on sitting on a golden ticket...
* Somehow I have had success in trading. So many lucky things went my way, and after 4 years I would say I'm above average, but if you don't trade my advice is don't start. lol.
* People who I have learnt the most from in the space:
   * Tone Vays - This guy has that premium autistic behaviour where he will just speak facts. He gets a lot of shit, but the information over the years II have got from him has been invaluable.
   * Safidean - Similar to the above. Hard truths.
* I believe the worst news/ event would be for the US to come out and ban it. Yes it wouldn't die, but the price would fall 50% in a day.
* Obviously I'm bullish and always have been. It's simply just math at this point.
* And just a price prediction for a bit of fun although I have zero clue:
   * 2020 end of year: 24k
   * 2021 high: 120k

BTCmarkets is good - after that I can't really say much for many others.

This was happening to me a few weeks ago when I tried to get it going. I lack any decent computer knowledge and these were the only changes I made:
4g ram + 320hdd (always crashed)
8g ram + 256ssd (works perfectly)
I'm aware that this could come across as obvious to you, but if it helps another noob like me reading this post then my work here is done haha
