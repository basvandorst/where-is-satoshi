It's china alright, but not for the reasons you'd think; it's the preferred method for settlement/gambling on this European Cup that's driving this surge.

thanks, this looks great!

agreed, this needs to happen - really is a test case for bitcoin

@_date: 2019-12-19 13:32:21
your crypto expertise is more than enough - thanks so much!

Thanks so much, great to see, hopefully you'll get a bunch of questions from HKers soon!

do you think something like lightning is ready to be rolled out as a Point of Sale System for businesses to accept? Bear in mind any of these suggestions will most likely come under full attack of the Chinese State..

this HK resistance movement really is a perfect application in the real world for censorship-resistant, permissionless money - bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-12-19 13:19:38
all good stuff, man, thank you!
@_date: 2019-12-19 13:04:06

for the Spark fund that has just been seized it's for medical expenses and supplies and a legal fund to pay fines/and or lawyers for defenses against govt charges.  
The Yellow economic circle, it is any businesses in the city that are not owned by pro-ccp/pro govt people/companies, mostly day to day expenses - restaurants, retail stores etc

Hello I'm sure you're aware of what's been happening in our city this year; for those unaware HK'ers are facing a deaf and incompetent local and national govt and a tyrannical paramilitary police force using Rule by Law tactics to crush the majority will of the people of HK, in our struggle for full genuine democracy. One of the most respected funds for assisting people caught up in police brutality and politicized charges is the Spark fund which today has had their funds frozen on trumped up charges of money laundering. 
Can any of the real experts that browse this sub offer the people of HK some suggestions on how Bitcoin can help in facilitating a separate uncensorable economy here? 
Thanks people!

The Chinese economy is in freefall. The Banking system is freezing up, the banks are effectively insolvent, the state-owned economy is leveraged beyond any reason, unable to service debts, instead of focusing on their core business, SOEs in china took out massive loans betting on an ever appreciating RMB, now the RMB has been forced to devalue they are in serious trouble and will only escape default through more quantitive easing by the PBOC. This is no organic demand and overcapacity in most of the job-creating sectors is obscene. Add to the fact that they were forced to use what little cash on hand they had this summer to prop up the value of their worthless stock and it's a recipe for bank runs. C level management and families are beginning to appreciate this are scrambling to get their ill-gotten gains as far away from the Chinese Kleptocracy as possible - via bitcoin. This has just begun, skullfuckery, moonshot, this is gentlemen etc.

I'm a HK-based enthusiast and yes I've heard of the company and actually met a guy who worked for them when they were getting started early last year, It was obvious from the get-go this thing was a total ponzi/scam. The guy in question was completely illiterate/ignorant to any of the technology or the current scene at the time, and couldn't really answer any of my questions about the actual business or anything Bitcoin-specific. Not surprised at all this has happened, greedy grandmas and people looking to launder money are a dime a dozen in this part of the world im afraid. Seems they just used the BTC story to dress up an old tired pyramid scheme. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 03:29:43
*up to* 3 billion. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 16:53:12
thanks man! 
@_date: 2015-02-09 03:28:15
nope, these guys were just your typical run-of-the-mill pyramid/ponzi 
using BTC as their hook, their story to get naive old grandmas to invest. The BTC numbers are for sure fake, but the cash invested seems more plausible. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 03:25:01
Yup, so the big issue now is we have a dozen or more scammed punters screaming at their local representatives to do something, in particular they're asking the HKMA to 'ban the sale of bitcoin' continuing in their ignorance that this scam was because of bitcoin rather than a run-of-the-mill ponzi. They also fail to understand we already have laws in HK outlawing Pyramid Schemes. However, a few politicians will undoubtedly run with this for their own aims, so we may see some ridiculous legislation being brought to the legislative council in the near future. One of the local bitcoin association people either did a terrible job of articulating the actual situation in this story or, i suspect, more likely was horribly misquoted by the press. Get ready for some more govt stupidity..
