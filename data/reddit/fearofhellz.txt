@_date: 2016-04-06 07:03:37
it will undoubtedly get even easier :)

What does this mean for blockchain development in Japan, in your opinion?
@_date: 2016-04-25 11:53:29
Wasn't aware it was that strict in the country, ty for the info!
@_date: 2016-04-06 11:35:21
well that seems to be the most logical outcome, but we'll see :)
@_date: 2016-04-26 09:31:54
Not an unusual trend for one day, but will this continue throughout the next few days?

It's impossible for everyone to "get some bitcoins". Everyone can get a piece of the supply cap though ;)
@_date: 2016-04-24 08:51:16
well they can buy it at premium prices :)

It takes some effort, but getting Bitcoin in the hands of consumers in not all that difficult with the right dedication.

Well if the businesses are ignoring EMV security on cards by just swiping them,  it sends a clear message of what is wrong I guess :)
@_date: 2016-04-28 15:48:05
haha ;) No i meant, how would people from the Netherlands be represented? Would more or less people know about Bitcoin and actively use it?

I wouldn't deem it impossible no :)

Another useless article from a website that has 0 credibility
@_date: 2016-03-01 15:02:07
because the fee is 0.0004 ? Normal fees are 0.001 and currently only high prio fees have a chance of getting through on time (0.0044 btc fees)

That would be something we can all benefit from, that's for sure :)
@_date: 2016-03-10 07:23:32
We reviewed it, and mentioned how it has a high chance of collapsing soon. People still get paid though, but their lack of transparency is worrying and returns are too good to be true
@_date: 2016-03-22 06:39:36
ah yes, who can forget Scrypt.cc.... or GAW..... such a dark history for cloud mining really :(
@_date: 2016-03-14 13:57:42
Seems to be working again, although still a bit slower than normal.
@_date: 2016-03-13 11:36:50
BTC-E has far too many issues - in my opinion - to be called a "trustworthy" exchange these days.
@_date: 2016-03-31 11:40:02
Although Russia has never been keen on Bitcoin, do you agree these statements are crossing the line?
@_date: 2016-01-29 08:16:53
Show me the proof before making useless comments :)
@_date: 2016-03-14 08:12:44
certain blends of traditional finance with new technology just won't work, and this seems to be one of them :)

Good luck with the search, decent writers are very hard to find these days
@_date: 2016-03-18 17:48:40
What do you expect to see from this partnership?
@_date: 2016-03-25 12:16:36
Would be interesting if governments decide to side with Bitcoin rather than central bank-issued digital currencies
@_date: 2016-03-25 12:16:01
heh that is an interesting take on the story for sure :)
@_date: 2016-03-17 08:04:35

Have you used the WhaleClub platform before? If so, what was your experience like?
@_date: 2016-03-22 16:33:19
absolutely disgusting to link such a tragic event to Bitcoin when there is no connection between the two.
CoinTelegraph really has no shame sometimes. 
@_date: 2016-03-21 18:39:16
Yup, Cointellect :) Technically not Bitcoin mining though, but still :) 
@_date: 2016-03-29 13:03:44
Well PR would be a start I guess :)
@_date: 2016-03-13 17:59:48
I have removed the image and replaced it with a different one, which I told you about on Twitter.  That part was handled ina professional matter on my end.
You, on the other hand, go on a ramapge smearing my personal linked in, and now apparently Reddit too over an issue that has been sorted. 
Have i been sarcastic? Show me where then.
Moreover, you are the one trying to seek attetnion about something rather than conducting business in a professional manner. 
I am sorry the image was used with proper credit, the issue was sorted professionally, what more do you want besides attention? 
@_date: 2016-03-30 14:02:50
What will the future of Bitcoin hold now that these task forces are coming to fruition?
@_date: 2016-03-13 19:06:09
No need to get up on your horse, we are all entitled to our own opinion.
It is true BTC-E has survived a lot of other exchanges though.
@_date: 2016-03-13 11:39:32
sarcasm is apparent in this one. If not, a reality check will b ecoming your way relatively soon :)

@_date: 2016-03-13 18:00:10
Oh really? have we met? Or would you prefer to remain "anonymous" on Reddit? :)
@_date: 2016-03-09 07:32:46
Publishers have to indicate if they want to accept Bitcoin or not, that's all i know.... 
@_date: 2016-03-26 15:35:01
either a bit or a group of people upvoting particular content, it's nott hat uncommon on Reddit tbh
@_date: 2016-01-25 12:04:12
this is the most pathetic article I have ever read. CoinTelegraph shows its true colors once again!
@_date: 2016-03-22 06:41:14
yeah that should have put me off too, but I met some of their management in London before investing so... yeah :)
@_date: 2016-03-25 21:58:47
it doesn't sound strange at all. I think it's actually quite interesting :) 
@_date: 2016-03-21 17:41:26
Have you ever lost money to cloud mining company?
@_date: 2016-03-07 07:40:34
Such a generous offer, I wish more people would give free viruses to others....
(that was sarcasm btw, it doesn't always translate well over the Net for some reason)
@_date: 2016-03-24 14:12:49
quite an interesting development, curious to see how this will play out
@_date: 2016-01-15 14:24:24
Cryptsy a foundation of Bitcoin? Oh dear.
@_date: 2016-06-06 14:00:21
You clearly have an issue with reading. The article said anything is possible, and how some people PREDICTED it would have gone down by now. Yet it didn't. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 13:00:57
the government proposed disabling wifi hotspots as long as the country was on high alert for terrorism. Luckily, they shot down those plans.  Can't say they never tried, though :)
@_date: 2016-06-06 13:55:07
so does your reply, with the difference that the article brings something to the table. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 14:06:15
2013? Geez...
@_date: 2016-06-06 14:02:04
It's called "common sense and don't listen to anything people claim will happen without credible evidence". 
@_date: 2016-06-06 14:01:21
Yet is, in this event, a recap of how certain traders predicted the price to go down by now, but it didn't happen. It does not indicate that will happen either, that is just what YOU make of it. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 13:01:06

Always good to see more businesses accept Bitcoin payments :) 
@_date: 2016-02-18 11:23:58
most people don't see the need to use Bitcoin over other payment methods, it's that simple :)

in an alternate dimension, they might swap Wright for Assange too :)
@_date: 2016-05-08 13:37:13
Edman was instrumental in bringing down Silk Road in 2013, as people feel he was responsible for tracing the Bitcoin transactions of Ross Ulbricht.
@_date: 2016-05-02 12:53:56
you can be Satoshi for a day tomorrow if you like? I don't mind :)
@_date: 2016-05-06 11:44:53
Are you surprised by these numbers in the report?
@_date: 2016-05-11 07:47:58
Are you excited to play this game on Android? Or have you played it on iOS before?
@_date: 2016-05-04 07:19:13
if Kleiman is Satoshi, and Wright now comes "out of the closet" to tell he is Satoshi, he got the info from Kleiman...somehow. 
If that is so, he is trying to steal the legacy his best friend - who passed away, sadly enough - left the world.
That would be a whole new low, so let's just hope i'm wrong!
@_date: 2016-05-03 12:28:12
2014? really?
@_date: 2016-05-01 07:02:00
no need for further regulation if you ask me :)
@_date: 2016-05-05 06:59:31
ooh clever word play :)
@_date: 2016-05-03 08:09:49
Do you feel the Bitcoin Spellbook will be a good resource for aspiring blockchain developers?
@_date: 2016-05-02 12:49:54
Does this surprise you, or does it make sense somehow?
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:12:30
there is no public evidence, hence it is not real until proven otherwise. 
@_date: 2016-05-13 15:40:01
Your thoughts on Coinfac and their ludicrous claims?
@_date: 2016-05-06 07:24:34

nothing does unfortunately ;)

Anyone fancy downloading this in a sandboxed environment? Not too keen on grabbing a PDF file from untrusted sources :) 
@_date: 2016-05-02 13:58:43
very interesting idea, i doubt it can verify the validity...then again, you never know these days
@_date: 2016-05-12 16:26:13
Company is called Avalara, gg
@_date: 2016-05-02 13:57:53
wonder if this will get as much attention as all of the Bitcoin ransomware stuff has though...
@_date: 2016-05-05 08:06:37
now that would be something :)
@_date: 2016-05-01 07:00:55
will do! bottles look cool too tho :)
@_date: 2016-05-05 08:07:16
oh I sincerely hope it is, you just never know :)
@_date: 2016-05-02 12:50:23
because he can't, and it would get him far less than another 15 minutes of fame? :)
@_date: 2016-05-02 12:53:11
Get your tomatoes here, one Satoshi a piece! (See what i did there?)
