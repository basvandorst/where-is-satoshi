Ah OK, that starts to seem a bit more reasonable then. Thanks for explaining.

But it's not just "into lightning", is it? It's more like "into the Starbucks LN payment channel". And the Cafe Nero payment channel, and the Costa Coffee payment channel, and a separate payment channel for everybody I might want to pay. Unless these channels all get aggregated by a bank or something. Have I got this right?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:00:09
Because I was wrong, basically. You don't need to maintain a separate payment channel for each vendor, you can use the lightning network like a checking account with infrequent transactions to/from the main blockchain. IIUC / in theory anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:15:56
So the incentive is that you get to charge a fee? Does the network automatically look for the lowest total fee when routing transactions? Or what?
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:47:54
I was thinking the same thing. In practice a huge proportion of "decentralized" web / email traffic goes through Google / Facebook / Cloudflare. Like maybe there ends up being a Cloudflare of LN, which in practice can favour or delay payments to different recipients. Even losing deposits might occasionally be worth it, if you *really* want to stop eg. a competitor receiving payments.

Isn't it "like a bank" in the sense that it's functionally not much different from cashing out your btc into a bank account when you want to spend it? Except you need a separate account (channel) for each vendor? Or I might have totally misunderstood.
Edit: Apparently I *had* misunderstood, you don't need a separate channel for each vendor as transactions are routed via your existing payment channels.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:46:52
Possibly I misunderstood the video, but he's buying from a channel that's *already* been funded from the main blockchain, right? So in general if I walk into a coffee shop, I'm going to have to do a "traditional" main blockchain transaction before I can do that? And If I want to make use of this fast payment method, I have to maintain an always-funded channel for every coffee shop I might want to visit?
Or have I got this wrong?
Edit: Apparently I had indeed got this wrong, wrt needing separate channels for every vendor.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:52:12
What's the incentive to act as a routing node?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:53:34
Thanks! I worry a bit about the potential for mischief from bad nodes, but if it works as advertised it sounds cool.

The Leeds judge thought there was a risk of a mistrial, the appeal judge accepted that there was a risk of a mistrial, the defence in at least one of the cases [sought a mistrial]( Yaxley-Lennon (aka Tommy Robinson) pled guilty, and his lawyers said he 'expressed deep regret for the “breach  of  integrity  of  the  court system”  which  his  actions  had  caused.'
@_date: 2018-08-06 21:38:40
I don't think that's true. The judgment of his appeal is [here]( Para 17:


Had all of the things referred to there been published previously? Do you have a link?
As far as I can tell he was, in fact, arrested and imprisoned for breaking reporting restrictions, thereby risking mistrials of cases against people who may have committed serious sex offences against young girls. He pled guilty but an appeal found procedural errors in his previous hearing, so he's currently bailed and awaiting a retrial.

I don't particularly "believe Bitcoin will succeed", but I believe it has novel and interesting properties that make it worth a punt. I still feel it's kind of a technology waiting for a compelling application though.

As a largely ignorant slob who's just taking a proper look at bitcoin after seeing some stuff in the press, the Cyprus hype bubble hypothesis seems very persuasive. Is there any actual evidence of real people investing significantly in btc to avoid the savings levy? I'm doubtful normal people would even be able to work out how to do that, let alone think it was a good idea. Anybody want to persuade me I've got this wrong?
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:02:50


Same issue here.
@_date: 2013-03-27 08:58:04
But, there is a question as to how much *monetary* use value bitcoin has in reality. You can easily buy a house, car or chocolate bar with USD, whereas btc doesn't currently buy you much other than drugs, pizza and VPNs, not necessarily at favourable prices. It has far more *potential* monetary use value, but this is at best a gamble. Presently it looks to me like the market cap of btc is very high for the amount of non-speculative trade.

Do you know if they have a specific problem with it, or if it's just that it's a legal grey area?

I can sell you one (which is about £100 worth at the moment), but to be honest I wouldn't recommend investing money in btc unless you can afford to lose it, particularly at the moment. If you say where you are, you might get somebody nearby with whom you can deal face to face.
@_date: 2013-03-26 20:42:50
I don't really know. I'm thinking maybe bitcoin has enough utility to the underground economy that it has some kind of future. I'm not particularly confident it offers normal people any killer feature that'll make it worth the trouble. I guess this is a contrarian opinion around here though. We'll see.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:59:09
To be fair, not all of the advice here is clueless. Some of it is malicious.

I think some people are idealogically attached to the idea of bitcoin as a currency and are bothered that people are trying to make a quick buck by speculating.

Personally I am sceptical. Depressingly, the general trend seems to be for people to eschew personal responsibility for services (webservers, email servers etc) in favour of 3rd party providers (facebook, gmail etc). It seems likely people would behave similarly with bitcoin.

The rising price of BTC is driving the media attention, *and* the media attention is driving up the price of BTC. I've got a bad feeling about this.

He's a nobody who somehow ended up on Newsnight and said things people weren't expecting. He wasn't biting the hand that feeds him, he was promoting his business, which doesn't appear to be particularly successful.
This is not to say he's wrong, but his "insider status" is nonsense.
@_date: 2013-03-26 08:55:58
This is a very reasonable question. "It's hard because of issues with other currencies" might be true, but it doesn't mean it's not hard, or that it's going to get easier any time in the foreseeable future. People mostly need to use other currencies, and even with an optimistic vision of bitcoin's future that's not going to change for a long time.
