You shouldn't be supportive when investing then you're just losing money and Investments with this much risk and such a little reward should not have such a large support group
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:58:13
Lmao you people actually think this'll replace the American currency?
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:49:14
That's fair. It's the people that spout "weak hands" and that kind of stuff I'm mad at
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:57:08
By then we'll all be slaves to the robots, or bitcoin won't be around anymore lmao

This graph is both, not accurate, and just a plainly useless way to show a market trend
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:53:07
What kind of currency works where the best thing you can do with it is to hide it under your bed instead of putting it back into the sysyem via investments or purchases? A working economy need A cash flow.

I never bought, it's just fun to make fun of people giving their money to the rich, while adamantly supporting a bad investment/currency
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:30:38
Holy shit no, on a worldwide scale the price is definitely more important than the percentage
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:26:06
Wow buddy come up with that yourself? Yeah bitcoin price sure did matter a lot before the entire world got interested in it

Dude, if I was investing for 10 years,  it wouldn't be in something that was likely to lose all value by then.  If it were for my children id put it in blue chip stocks,  or 10 year bonds to assure they had money for college,  rather than gambling it online like you seem to be.

I started making fun of Bit-Boys this February so my expectations have been met flawlessly!
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:32:57
You probably shouldn't gamble your children's possible college tuition  funds
@_date: 2019-01-11 02:22:37
Ah yes, like how the us currency became popular as a horse feed filler in the 1700's! Wait no that's fucking stupid
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:57:19
Whoops, looks like this argument was both stupid, and doesn't apply anymore!

Damn, he was almost right, and still could be 
@_date: 2019-01-11 02:14:26
Think of it as 1 year lmao
@_date: 2019-01-10 23:58:17
Stocks aren't a currency, bitcoin is supposed to be
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:30:24
Good job! People like you really show that it is better to offload your bitcoin to the poor suckers than use it as a currency! 
@_date: 2018-11-24 16:04:02
Nobody wants to lose money, even if they can live without it
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:04:27

It was a joke you dense butter
@_date: 2018-12-22 22:56:38
Are you all this stupid? So if I say that the price will be below 100$ in a year that's also a 50/50 chance because there are 2 outcomes? This is some of the worst reasoning ice ever seen.
@_date: 2018-12-21 22:55:47
Bro, if I had a time machine I do a lot more than invest in bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-22 22:57:46
Holy shit you got this math wrong, just because there are 2 possible outcomes doesn't mean it's a 50-50 outcome.
