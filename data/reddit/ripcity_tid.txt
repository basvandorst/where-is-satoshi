Did it work?

Except he sees that Litecoin's success is tied to Bitcoin. If Bitcoin crashes and people lose confidence, it's not Just Bitcoin they will lose confidence in, but cryptocurrencies as a whole.  It's possible that confidence will return, but it would take a while.  By being the first and being as successful as it's been, the whole industry's fate is kind of tied to Bitcoin, for better or for worse.

I've googled, read blog posts and follow both and I'm just as confused as you are. I understand that everything in a wallet prior to August 1 will work on both forks (if they happen), but I am completely unclear what happens after that.  I use Breadwallet and have no idea if anything I get paid after August 1st will work regardless of which fork it comes from;  or if anything I add to my wallet after that day will work; or even if something that is added to my wallet from the wrong chain will invalidate my whole wallet.  My brain hurts over all of this, and it's difficult to get a clear answer because it's been muddied by hostile politics on both sides.
Edit: the link from really cleared things up for me.  Not sure how I never came across that post before this.  Thanks!

At least I understand what it was that you were trying to do.  I have no idea what that person in the gif was even going for.

Cool, thanks!

Thank you for answering so many questions! I'm fairly new to bitcoin, so I feel like I've been playing a lot of catch-up these last few weeks.  This thread and that site are a huge help!
I also use breadwallet and don't quite understand the answer above.  What does it mean in practical terms that my wallet isn't compatible with Electrum? Are there only consequences in the result of a split?

I see.  Should I be moving to these other wallets ahead of the possible fork?  Or are BIP39 wallets  fine as long as I plan on keeping my money there?
