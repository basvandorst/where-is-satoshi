Unfortunately, trying to switch from selling oil in something other than dollars didn't work out so well for Saddam.   Having followed closely the lead up to the first Gulf War, I believe his desire to price oil in Euros was a significant contributing factor to his ultimate downfall.   Invading Kuwait helped too...
From a Bitcoin standpoint, just trading a portion of the global oil market in bitcoin would be a game changer.

I totally agree.   This technology is upsetting a lot of powerful people - and not just in Russia.   The nice thing about it is you can play this game from anywhere in the world.   My recommendation is to find someplace supportive of blockchain technology and head there.  You can still work to affect change in Russia, just from a safe distance.

Me too.   She's strong, educated and has roots that run real deep.   Oh, and she's a good cook.   Something to be said for girls raised in the south (GRITS).  
Not that being to token Yankee in the family hasn't presented challenges.  Took me a while to appreciate putting cole slaw on a BBQ sandwich.   That and 'visiting' - sitting around for hours talking about people you have no clue who are.   
All in all, southern girls are some of the best.

Yes, I read them.   A pretty clueless bunch.

I have not explored any.   My desire for encryption is more from a privacy standpoint than anything else.   Had my identity stolen earlier this year and I decided to get serious about my online exposure.  
I encrypt any sensitive documents with a passphrase as well.     I am confident that between TrueCrypt and native MS Office password encryption all but the most determined would be kept out.

I love TrueCrypt.  Using it with Dropbox works great.   Just keep your volume size down as every time you change a file, it syncs the entire volume.   I use 250 Mb as a baseline - it takes about 5-10 seconds to sync.
I am so glad the audit of the TrueCrypt code is going well.   I reviewed some of the preliminary findings yesterday.   There were some issues identified, but nothing malicious like back doors were identified.     Details here.     Click the link in the first paragraph.
I hope this wonderful utility finds new life.

I think it is improbable that the coin limit would be exceeded at the network level because of the interest in keeping the Bitcoin network viable.   However, I believe that fractional reserve bitcoins are in our future and it doesn't require anyone's approval.  Just the complacency of people to keep their bitcoins in institutions that partake in this practice.

I had heard that in a speech by Patrick Byrne - I believe when they made the original CounterParty/Overstock announcement.  IIRC, he said that one company has property rights to the stock.  Others have contractual rights.  It went something like this.   You have contractual rights to contractual rights to property rights on the stock.

I am taking mine with me in case I need to pay Kharon, the ferryman of the dead. 
"Those who had not received due burial and were unable to pay his fee, would be left to wander the earthly side of the Akheron, haunting the upper world as ghosts."

I have done business with them several times in the past.  Never a problem, good customer service.
