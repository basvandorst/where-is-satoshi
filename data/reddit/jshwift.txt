"85 . 126 million... I look it up every day."
this made me laugh out loud lmao just imagining the permanent black cloud of bitterness and deadness in the eyes. 100% would never be able to eat pizza again. I'd literally go into Vietnam flashbacks just seeing pizza.
I had a buddy that sold his Bitcoins during one of the early rises... value had been more or less flatlined for so long that selling for a few hundred dollars profit seemed like a smart move at the time.
I take it as a cautionary tale to not look at crypto in the short term.

That's comforting to hear. Honestly if i had a ton of bitcoins early and bought pizzas n shit with them, but still kept enough to profit even just a few hundred thousand dollars... i wouldn't even be that salty about the loss of potential millions. I'd get over it. But missing out totally and being left just as poor as you were before and still stuck balls deep in the rat race... that's perma haunting lol.

I don't mean hold it permanently or longer than you should have. I mean sell it when you feel it's the right moment, just try and consider every factor first instead if making a tempting premature choice. Crypto is the future, but that doesn't mean Bitcoin is the future. Bitcoin has first to market advantage (which is pretty significant), but that's about the only factor separating it from another "brand" taking over.
I can name u tons of brands that had huge first to market advantage that ended up being replaced, and I can name you tons that held on to this power and evolved accordingly. 
The government will either figure out how to control the current major coins or they will just create their own federal coin.
If you're holding long term with no intention to exit, then you're essentially making a donation... which is fine if you can afford to do that!
