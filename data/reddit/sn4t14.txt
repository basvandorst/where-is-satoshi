Hi, one of the authors here, quantum computing is not for general-purpose computing like normal computers are, there are many things they simply cannot do in such a fast manner, as far as I know, one of the things it can't do is SHA256 operations. But that doesn't matter, even if SHA256 operations *can* be done by a quantum computer, because RSA, DSA and ECDSA (the encryption algorithm protecting your precious bitcoins) [would all be broken]( by that super-fast quantum computer either way.

I agree with myself completely, you don't need the ridiculous speedups that SHA256 ASICs have to make GPUs uncompetitive.

You can opt into *understanding* segwit, but you can't opt into *supporting* them, as all current nodes support all segwit transactions, valid or not. It most definitely affects older clients because they work effectively like SPV clients in the case of segwit transactions, without letting the user know in any way. Would you consider it a security issue if your client had a chance of silently turning into an SPV client? I would.
It is much safer to hard fork those clients off the chain if segwit is adopted. That way, there is no chance that they get attacked with invalid segwit transactions. Fail hard and loudly, instead of chugging along silently with reduced security.

It claimed the power consumption was 15W, way less than "half the power consumption of a GPU", if you don't believe that, take a look at [AMD's official numbers for HBM](


Okay, let's go by those numbers, let's also assume that the card in question is an RX480, it has a [rated bandwidth of 224GB/s]( which, going by AMD's official numbers on HBM, means 6.4W is consumed by the memory. Now, let's also assume that AMD boasts the best case *by far*, and that HBM is about as power efficient as normal GDDR5, that'd put the memory at about 25W, still not even *close* to half of those 80W.


Math fail? 30W is 37% of 80W, not "over half"


I never said anything about "ASIC memory", this entire time I've been talking about an ASIC connected to HBM chips.


Depends on your definition of "not significant", I'd consider a ~50% power savings to be significant enough to make GPUs uncompetitive.


No, I'm saying you could connect an ASIC to the same amount of memory with far less die space and power draw than a GPU. the memory controller is of course a requirement, but doesn't consume a majority of die area or power on a GPU.


A memory controller won't be able to magically speed DRAM up, do you even know how this works?


You can order [1GB GDDR5 for under $15 each]( if you buy a thousand on a reel, HBM is slightly more expensive, but economies of scale will mean 100k units will probably be much less than $15 per GB.


I responded to every point you made, it took you 3 replies to rebut that, and now I'm rebutting your current points, I don't see the issue?


Okay, so I'll repeat myself, please point out where I did this so I can ask questions, clarify, and/or apologize for misrepresenting your argument.


This seems like a pointless tirade about me being wrong, without any actual points, so I'm not going to respond.


Stop putting words in my mouth. You complain about me lying about you, here you are lying about me. My argument has never been that you can make faster memory, my argument has always been that you can make ASICs that use exactly the same memory as GPUs, but reduce power consumption by eliminating the GPU core, and save production cost with a smaller die area.


In a reasonable discussion, you're responsible for backing up your claims. If the other side asks for sources or elaboration, you provide them. How is the other side supposed to have a rational discussion if they don't have all the information available to them?
If you want to get on track, I propose you describe in some detail how you would build an ASIC to compete with GPUs using equihash or cuckoo with a 5GB memory requirement-- my original examples
Despite you not including the 5GB requirement, and also mentioning ethash, sure.
Let's assume you're going to produce 100 thousand units. Buy at least 500 thousand 1GB HBM chips, pay a company a few million USD to design the ASIC, judging by some die shots of [Tahiti]( GPUs, and being very generous at that, the part of the die used for the memory controller is probably under 50mm^2 on a 28nm die, let's say an even 50, and let's also ignore the fact that the rest of my math is based on 14nm lithography, which would halve that. Then let's assume another 10mm^2 for implementing equihash/cuckoo fast enough to keep up with the memory. From industry experience, I can tell you it costs the GPU manufacturer about 50% of the retail price to make the GPU, let's assume the HBM is free, and the entire cost there is for the die, with a 0% markup from AMD. An RX 470 is a 232mm^2 die, and costs a bit over $140 retail for the 4GB model, meaning it costs the manufacturer about $70, or just under $0.31/mm^2.
Now your ASIC costs you $18.6 to make, and your HBM costs at most $12/GB. If you can't get it for less than that, buy enough 8GB RX 470s ($180 for the 8GB model) and desolder the HBM off them. Now we're up to $78.6, slightly more than it costs the GPU manufacturer to make a 4GB GPU, about $20 less than it costs them to make an 8GB GPU. Let's be generous (yet again) and assume all the other misc costs (the PCB and everything on it, case and cooling for the ASIC, etc) take those $20 away from us. We now have an IC with, at worst, an identical memory controller, power consumption wise, and you have a hardware implementation of the actual algorithm, instead of having to run an OpenCL version on the GPU.
To figure out the power consumption of our hardware implementation of the algorithm, let's look at the first generation of X11 ASICs, if you feel another algorithm is more appropriate as a comparison, you can do the math for that as well. X11 seems to get about [3MH/s on a 280x]( whereas the first ASICs achieved [over 100x that for less than 3x the power consumption]( of a 280x, so that's about 30x more power efficient. From my previous data, I concluded that 50W of those 80W that the GPU consumes, according to your own numbers, is consumed by the GPU core, 1/30th of that is 1.5W.  HBM is 30W for 8GB, or 19W for 5GB, plus 1.5W for the ASIC, let's add another 5W for the memory controller, and let's assume all the other misc things on the PCB, and the inefficiency of the power supply, adds the remaining 4.5W needed to reach 40W.
To sum up, that's $90 for each ASIC, consuming 40W, put a ten in a box, 400W, $900. Compare that to a GPU mining rig, 5 GPUs = 400W, 8GB RX 470s are about $180 like I mentioned above, totaling $900 as well. Let's ignore the price and power consumption of the motherboard/CPU/RAM needed to run those 5 GPUs. You've got 2x the speed, for the same price, and the same performance. This will very quickly drive the difficulty up above the break-even for GPU rigs.
I want to note that at every turn, I rounded numbers in your favor, ignored various factors that would make ASICs even better compared to GPUs (ignoring mobo/CPU/RAM power and cost, ignored the fact that I looked at the size of a 28nm memory controller, whereas I was basing my numbers on a 14nm process which would've cut the die size in half), and always assumed the worst case for everything on an ASIC. It was still twice the performance per watt. Even if there are things I missed that would make it more expensive or less power efficient, I feel the things I ignored, rounded, or assumed in your favor would far outweigh that.
Now with that 1500 word essay out of the way, I'd like to hear what you have to say, it's well possible that I dropped a 0 somewhere along the way, or that I'm just completely missing something that'd quadruple the power consumption, or something like that.
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:14:58
It also says the *actual* consumption of 4GB of GDDR5 is about 30W, not even close to "over half" of the power consumption.

That's not even close to the same thing. You *cannot* get a reference client released in 2011 to sync past block 252450. You can get a *fork* of 0.5.4 to sync, but that's because it was updated to work with blocks &gt;252450. How hard is this to understand?
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:39:04
It won't sync, actually, read [this]( Bitcoin clients &lt;=0.7.2 won't sync past block 252450.
Yes, nodes to still play by their rules, the issue is that *other* nodes don't. A current node receiving a segwit transaction will silently accept it no matter what. This means that you get the same security level as if you were running an SPV client, but without the big "this is less secure" warning that comes with SPV.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:22:26


You're going to have to provide a source, [here's a source]( that says 4GB of HBM is &lt;15W.


Yes, economies of scale do make GPUs cheaper, but there's a *lot* more stuff on a GPU than an ASIC, and you're *massively* underestimating the size of the big players like BitFury and Bitmain. I seriously doubt that a few GB of DRAM would cost them more than an entire GPU with the same amount of memory, if you want to make that claim, you should back it up with actual numbers.


I'm well aware, but you don't need the 230mm^2 die of an RX 480 to connect a 256-bit memory bus. I don't really get what point you're trying to make, exactly? Is it that wide buses are some magic that can't be implemented on ASICs? Is it that you can't make it any better because GPUs already have a wide bus? In both cases, you're wrong, a memory-hard algorithm would mean you could pair a small chip with a few DRAM chips and get equal performance with a fraction of the die size and power consumption, the only potential issue being needing enough pins to connect to the memory, but that doesn't require a 230mm^2 die either.


The 2-3GB I mentioned were specifically related to Ethash scaling, please read what I say better. The point still stands for larger memory requirements, but those would only push the scales further in favor of ASICs (8GB GPUs are about 3x the price of 4GB GPUs)


A memory-hard algorithm would presumably be limited by memory bandwidth, which in the case of HBM accounts for &lt;15% of the power consumption on a 470 when mining Ethash. Even if you underclock the core, the card still sits at about 100W (this number is from personal experience), with the RAM consuming only about 15%.


Yes, DRAM is the key, when you buy a GPU, you're mainly buying the GPU core, and again, if you want to claim that an entire &gt;=4GB GPU is more expensive than just buying that memory wholesale, you'll have to provide a source or at least some numbers.


None of *your* claims are correct.


No, I explicitly said that ASICs would have a smaller edge: "The edge that ASICs would have would be smaller"


Yes, and you think that industry won't give you a discount when you order 100k units of the same chip? How large do you think GPU manufacturers are? Because they're not ordering their memory in much larger lots.

That logic doesn't make sense. The fee market wouldn't inflate if there was no block size limit. A miner including fake TX without a block size limit would just cause his blocks to be bigger and have a higher orphan rate. No one would pay higher fees in that scenario because they wouldn't have to compete for block space with the fake TX. This incentive wasn't there until blocks started getting full, which wasn't part of the original Bitcoin design.
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:06:18
You're missing one crucial thing. GPUs are expensive and power hungry, memory chips aren't. ASICs could still be made much more power efficient, and the die could be shrunk (cheaper to manufacture), you can also put the ASICs in packages with more pins connected to more individual DRAM chips. There's also the added savings in being able to use smaller DRAM chips, as 2-3GB would be enough to mine Ethash until the ASIC becomes obsolete.
The edge that ASICs would have would be smaller, but they would be *much* cheaper to produce than GPUs and SHA256 ASICs, and they would be much more power efficient than GPUs.

How would anyone ban them from doing it? All they need is to find someone who's willing to sell them USD.

They can, they can all collude to only produce smaller blocks.


Do you have proof of this? I'm aware that Antpool has an above average amount of 0 byte blocks, but assuming malice isn't beneficial to discussion, and only leads to baseless conspiracy theories.


I don't think you know how this works, a pair of 0 byte blocks will orphan any single block of any size. They wouldn't need to mine large blocks to cause orphans for other miners.


Yes, larger blocks increase orphans, I've already explains how this keeps blocks small even if the size limit is increased.


What are you on about? What uses fees to decide on block sizes? EC sure doesn't.

Not quite, if that 10% reduces the blockchain's average transactions handled per second to below the created transactions per second, you're going to see a spike in fees. This is exactly what happened when blocks started frequently hitting 1MB. Fees don't linearly go up, they stay low until a backlog emerges.


Software issues, blocks being mined soon after the last one, etc. But you're missing the point. This is a conspiracy theory because you say "all Chinese miners" do this, but only Antpool seems to.


And 1MB just happens to be the magic number that prevents this? The average residential bandwidth doubles every few years, so if 1MB was the magic number a few year sago, 2MB will soon become the magic number.
Electricity price is a much bigger threat to centralization. A 0% orphan rate will only mean *maybe* a 5% higher profit margin. That's negligible compared to the difference in electricity cost in different places. A miner would much rather move to a place with 10% lower electricity cost, than a place with 5% increased profit due to no orphans.


See above. Orphans also incentivize smaller blocks.


I agree with you there, but that wasn't what I was saying at all, you said this:


And I was pointing out that EC isn't subject to this issue.


This is not a problem with 2MB blocks, the blockchain is 110GB right now, growing by about 50GB per year, increasing that to 100GB per year is just following the growth in storage capacity increase since we started hitting the block size limit.


Segwit does a good job of relieving fee pressure for a year.
I think you misunderstand how segwit works. It's transactions are *larger* than normal transactions due to the hack to make them a soft fork. The transaction itself becomes smaller because it doesn't contain the signature, but once you include the signature, it becomes larger. You could argue that this is a hack to make 1MB blocks contain more transactions, but that's just data hiding. You'll still need to store more than 1MB per block, because you need to store the witness data which isn't part of the block.


Replace by fee is still an issue, AFAIK, which makes chaining unconfirmed transactions just as insecure with segwit.


Funny, just yesterday I used Bitcoin for a payment, the only issue was the *20% transaction fee* I had to pay.


BU has a neutral stance on segwit, that doesn't make segwit good or bad, it's just that BU doesn't care (although BU doesn't implement segwit, read into that as you want). I wouldn't be opposed to the changes segwit makes if it was implemented as a hard fork if/when the network transitions to 2MB blocks. The only issue I have with it is the data hiding to make it an insecure soft fork.

This is not how basic economics works, if you have everyone racing to dump their money and exchange it for something else, almost everyone will suffer huge losses, and everyone will suffer at least *some* loss. Capital controls don't remove *all* loss, they just cap them at *some* loss.


A source that mentions that they can be circumvented, not that they don't work, or at least help, a currency in free-fall. Can you please give *one source* that shows that capital controls **don't work at all**?

Hey! I live in Iceland :3
Suck it :P
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:16:40
Jesus Christ, did I offend you by contradicting your claim? 
Anyway, yes, capital controls are terrible, but they're better than the alternative of letting your currency keep dropping in value unhindered. You can still do business with foreign currency, but the central bank needs to approve it. 
Now if it'll calm you, so note that we're working on relaxing capital controls, so you don't need to be so offended for much longer. 
I still don't get why you're so incredibly offended by the fact that I contradicted you, though.
@_date: 2016-10-26 12:12:49


This is an incredibly misleading claim, after the 2008 financial crisis, we've had very restrictive laws on possession and trade of any currency other than ISK. It's just as illegal for me as an Icelander to possess a dollar bill as it is to possess a bitcoin. This is exactly what your source explains. 
@_date: 2016-10-27 17:52:52
It's starting to sound like you have no idea why capital controls were implemented in Iceland in the first place. They were implemented in an emergency because the central bank completely ran out of foreign currency. You can either let your currency free-fall, or you can restrict sale to try to keep an entire country and it's inhabitants from going bankrupt.
Also, you keep waffling on about how "everyone knows they're terrible", but that's pretty much your only claim that you haven't provided a source for.
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:10:03
Yes, when you come back from vacation you're legally required to trade in all foreign currency. If you have a reason to possess foreign currency, you need to ask kindly to be allowed to. 
@_date: 2011-06-16 13:18:42
In Iceland the price of electricity is the same all over the country.

There is never a 100% chance of mining a block, they probably mean a 50% chance.

Yeah, no matter how often you have a 48.6% chance of winning, you'll always end up with a ridiculous losing streak, and to even have a  chance of profit short-term, you need to have thousands of times your betting amount, which means that every time you win, you gain 0.0-something percent of your money.
