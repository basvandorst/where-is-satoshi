One shouldnt be giving out monetary advice witout proper knowledge. Telling these new investors to buy is a total dick move. In financial advising, we are trained that there is no "Caveat emptor" since people are silly with their money.  
You may think that these people are responsible for their own actions, but you are only half right. Those who give the wrong financial advice are wrong too.

Along with the stupid fucking advice that "Instead of mining, you should just buy" every time someone asked about mining bitcoins.
Bunch of idiots giving out advice like that.

Surely this is a list that will make high school students wet :)

Sorry to hear your loss. As a professional financial planner that covers my client's needs from A to Z... i cringe when I hear people putting their last whatever in an investment account over the things that are most important.
Investment is probably the last thing you need when you cant get everything else covered. Im sorry for your loss, but you will not be the last.

On this note...with the risk of sounding ignorant.
How many bitcoins are out there and what is the total value of all BTC combined?

WEll too many a-holes gave advice  in this form:
 
"The best way to make money now is to buy instead of mine"

I got a good one "Buy low, but how do you know?"

"How low can you go?"

If you guys dont have cash to burn, bitcoin is not for you.  Sure I may sound like a fool when/if bitcoin reaches tens of thousands a coin, but if it doesnt the idiots who invested their life/retirement/education savings will be "gone" so to speak.
