If you can’t figure that out yourself, keep your money in a savings account, thanks.

$540 is not quite enough though.

No. It got to 20k based on mainstream interest. Now the mainstream is tired of it, and won’t re-enter the market anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:28:26
Indeed. Successful tech endeavors succeed fast, not over the course of decades.

Why so aggro? The price is low enough now that 1 BTC is something within reach for most people.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:20:55
Yeah that’s a new one, not yet seen on normie investment products
@_date: 2018-03-17 17:48:51
How about we let the market value assets based on their worth. Saying that it affects the price is just saying it’s not being accurately priced and the market is moving due to FUD and TA BS. But if you believe that -&gt; good buying opportunity.

Moon is entering Jupiter in the next phase of the 20-month VanHuesser curve. BUY NOW.

Your mom is correct. Just remind her to keep the tendies coming.

Why does your account have a balance if you’re paying by credit card? That doesn’t make any sense. With an ad account they charge you for what you use. To stop spending automatically, you set a budget (point at which they will stop serving ads) for what you want to spend.
  FB support is probably confused as to why somebody would preload a balance!

Those are all controlled by the Man.

What’s that other context? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

GREAT IDEA BOYS ��

Sorry, but you been drinking too much of the kool-aid. There are hundreds of companies with market caps that are bigger than bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:05:35
What do you think the lambos are for
@_date: 2018-02-19 07:09:01
Useless for quick lambos
@_date: 2018-02-24 03:44:22


Oh good. Then they shoot you instead.
  LPT: give robbers with guns what they want.

It’s the millennial way.

So no conflict. Technology changes.

The Man
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:40:14


It’s in the mainstream media and has been for a long, long time. All types: online, newspapers, tv. Everybody in North America, at least, has *heard* about it.
@_date: 2018-03-23 04:53:44
You’re missing the Van Heussen curve.
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:25:46
Lol my bunker has no fixed address
@_date: 2018-03-13 17:50:23
Maybe it’s viewed as purchasing it? I.e is it really a balance, or is it a purchase towards ad credit, subject to their terms and conditions that you agreed to (no bitcoin)? Then they may not want to refund you.

WRONG! FUD is anything that I disagree with!

You would have sold!!
@_date: 2018-12-24 00:27:44
So it’s basically a scam that preys on people that don’t know any better.
*Great*.
