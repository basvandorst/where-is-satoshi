cheers, I will try the torrent

I didn't see this until I changed currency to AUD, can I convert it to USD inside mtGOX? or will I need to go AUD &gt; BTC &gt; USD?
@_date: 2012-10-11 05:54:19
Thanks Mat, I will try this
@_date: 2012-10-28 03:41:50
How did you go compiling 0.7, I'd also like to update from 0.3 but not having much joy compiling.
I'm tempted to pay some btc for anyone to update the repository version or can help me compile the latest stable bitcoind for Raspberry pi Debian
@_date: 2012-05-28 11:04:12
What are the specs? GPUs etc
@_date: 2012-10-28 21:21:27
Yeah I do need to query the blockchain via JSON so I went with bitcoind. I've got the pi connected to an external disk and yes the sync is slow, I think I'd be best changing the pi to something a bit more powerful and has a newer version of bitcoind.

I did send them an email but never heard back
@_date: 2013-02-24 13:19:29
Opps, I didn't explain myself properly.
I was trying to say that I made bitcups and was explaining how it works, I need some people to have a play with it and give me feedback.
Maybe I sounded like I wanted to make a clone, but that is not true.
I apologize for the confusion.
@_date: 2013-02-06 04:17:46
Thank you that clears it up perfectly.
But if everyone is still working one the same block at the same time doesn't that mean before the block is solved everyone is using the same formula, and therefore can share the current results?
Maybe there a variables that are unique to the miner..
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:39:08
That's an interesting idea, if everyone traded on a peer to peer market database in which we could trade then the orders could be  made collectively to the exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-02-06 04:50:17
Wow, that is a ridiculous amount of data! Thank you for that detail.
I may have to go for the station wagon. j/k
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:37:30
oh, good find!
@_date: 2013-02-06 04:01:37
how large are we talking here? like the size of a Volvo?
@_date: 2013-02-26 12:26:04
Is there anyway the bitcoin community can verify production with the manufacturers? Has BFL dropped any names as to who it is?
@_date: 2013-03-28 13:22:58
It wasn't even a transfer between banks, just sell stock and money should go into my trading account. Nope, here is a 3 day barrier for you.
@_date: 2013-03-12 00:38:24
yeah I've tried with a dash also.
@_date: 2013-02-25 00:02:48
I agree, I was trying to be generous to give people enough time to fetch their wallet address and send btc to the unique payment address.
There are 2 reserve times, When you click 'Play now' you've reserved the spot as P1 or P2 in that game and give 1 hour to submit your wallet address (this is where you want your winnings paid out).
Once you wallet address has been submitted you're give 24 hours to place the bet (send btc).
I think I'll change it to 5mins and 15mins

Hmmm with all the Bitcoins we might soon be able to buy a new Myki system (Myki is our ticketing system for Trains/Trams/Buses in Melbourne, Australia. It cost $1.5Billion to create)
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:21:55
I'm pretty sure they are Moving average lines, but don't know what type they are or what scale.
Anyone know what that little green line chart is?
@_date: 2013-07-08 07:14:38
Thanks, they have some good stuff!
@_date: 2013-04-15 09:12:25
When I login I get "Error getting wallet balance" and when I try to send btc I get "Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction"
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:14:54
yeah, I have some spare btc I want to buy toys with this site would be great if only someone was there..
Opened up a chat support session and so far after an 1 hour no one has greeted me..
@_date: 2013-05-07 05:10:40
I was just thinking bitcoin could be an easily adapted incetive to keep torrents alive longer
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:22:36
Did you uncheck At market? I don't know I think I've seen this happen with me, I still don't fully understand it.
@_date: 2013-03-28 11:14:32
Yeah that is pretty awesome but I mean for buying anything
@_date: 2013-03-28 11:41:54
yeah tell me about it, I sold some shares to buy bitcoins. After 2 days I called the bank asking where's my money. "oh sir there is a 3 day cooling off period or you can pay $49 to get the money now."
@_date: 2013-02-24 23:57:03
He is required to choose the winner of P1 or P2 but he doesn't know which one he is choosing. 
The incentive is that he might get some free coins himself.

@_date: 2013-04-08 10:25:53
Here it is: 
@_date: 2013-02-24 23:55:28
Maybe, this is where the fairness might need to be adjusted. If you played like you described it acts as an incentive for P3 to call the game result.
When you're P1 or P2 you have a 1 in 3 chance to double your bet (when P3 picks your cup), and a 2 in 3 chance of getting back *almost* all of your bet (when P3 picks the empty cup and the pool is split 3 ways).
I thought it would be interesting making P3's position a bit like a bitcoin faucet and let a human decide the game rather than a random number. For people that want to gamble they can go head to head as P1/P2.
Do you think P3 should just have the same rules as P1 and P2? Where he is required to bet and can double his bet?
@_date: 2013-04-15 23:33:14
Any validation?
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:35:16
I wanted to ask a few questions like, what are the fees when ordering over $500? And just to guage them in general before risking $1,000 
@_date: 2013-04-20 00:43:15
Can we really believe these crazy prices? I'd be willing to bet that all these auctions are mostly filled with fake bids.
Even with a few months head start the break even point would be a long time if at all possible.
@_date: 2013-03-27 02:01:09
It's old news dude
@_date: 2013-02-06 04:00:56
Does it change from block to block? I mean a hash attempt even if the difficulty is the same? Do it need to use the block id as part of the seed?
@_date: 2013-03-28 10:55:21
None of the Butterfly Labs units have shipped, yet. not sure what the latest update is since 15/march. So you might be waiting a very long time.
A dude who bought an Avalon (which shipped in Jan/Feb?) got his money back in about a week, although now with the increased difficulty since then it would take longer to break even (plus the avalons are more expensive now)
@_date: 2013-04-19 12:22:19
I saw that too, did you notice the mini chart? it looked just as dodgy
@_date: 2013-03-28 12:54:34
what signals make you think that?
@_date: 2013-03-28 12:03:47
Looks like their domain name was registered from Queensland for only 1 year but they claim to be from Greece on the website.
I'll leave it up to you to decide.
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:34:12
localbitcoins.com, buy via online banking with some sellers
@_date: 2013-02-24 13:11:18
I'm not sure I understand what you're saying, are you saying it already exists?
@_date: 2013-03-28 11:56:46
There are more incentives to use bitcoin
* decentralized (nobody can take it from you, provided you have secured them)
* transactions are descrete if you wanted to buy/sell dodgy things
* low cost to move large amount of money (dont have to pay bullshit bank fees)
I think a portion of whats driving the price right now is safty for people in cyprus and other people not in cyprus thinking that's what is whats causing the price to go up. Also Mining equpiment is getting more powerful and less accessible, until more ASIC ship then it'll be more accessible.
@_date: 2013-04-19 07:13:00
@_date: 2013-03-27 01:59:34
yep watching it too, was waiting for someone to post this
@_date: 2013-03-28 11:45:10
Give me a service where I can buy ANYTHING on the internet through you, I just pay you the bitcoins for it.
I know there are some existing but it could be done much better.
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:38:48
sweet idea, I never saw it before. Only problem is the miner potential is wasted when the car is not in use. Unless it can switch to an alternative energy supply like a local electrical outlet. Probably possible with an induction coil in your car space/garage
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:05:46
@_date: 2013-05-07 05:09:25
Yes I wasn't think about breaking the law in any way. Only to strengthen or keep content available longer.
Content could be legal torrents like open software or blender movies.
@_date: 2013-03-28 12:34:07
cool, I was half joking but it would be awesome
@_date: 2013-04-20 10:23:02
He should have just given me the $50K and I would give him the bitcoins he would have earned each month. Then at the end I will give him a cheese burger.
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:18:53
Hmmm start simple first then work on it.
Hide hashing hardware in your car you're about to sell. Then the new owner buys the car and doesn't realise that while the engine is running it's hasing bitcoins for you, essentialy using the petrol (or gas for you Americans) purchased by the new owner to power the unit.
@_date: 2013-03-28 11:37:30
it wouldn't the first scam if it is, post up the link
@_date: 2013-02-25 07:13:21
That's an interesting idea, let me try to understand it.
* P3 is the house (a bot, not a human)
* P1 and P2 can bet on any cup including the same one
* If P1 and P2 pick the same cup P3 automatically places a bet of the same amount (of total in the pool or just the same as 1 Player) and selects a cup, if the cup selected is empty then the money is split 3 ways (everyone gets their money back essentially) otherwise if P3 selects the same cup as P1 and P2 then what? -P1 and P2 split the pool and P3 loses?
* If P1 and P2 pick different cups the game is played as normal, P3 doesn't bet but picks the winning cup. If the empty cup is selected then the money is split 3 ways.
I would have to try to prevent P1 and P2 from orchestrating their bets together picking the same cups to boost the pool.
@_date: 2013-05-07 05:15:11
I'll have to check out this seedbox thing. The idea only came to mind when I couldn't find seeders, I assume most leechers stop seeding once their download completes. What incentive do they have to keep their upload going?
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:21:39
you can use blockchain.info/wallet/&lt;your alias here&gt; and not worry about that random looking login string
@_date: 2013-02-10 09:12:29
tx_id I got from mt.gox couldn't be found on blockchain.info
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:26:13
I had the same problem, MtGox said to use a 0 prefix in your account number. Worked for me with CBA.
They take $10 fee for bank transfer and I think I took almost a week until I saw it in my account.
@_date: 2013-05-02 01:13:45
hmm not for me I get "invalid email" and under that "reset link has expired"

How would someone operate a blade? Would one required a blade server or controller? 
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:49:00
Yeah "Out of stock". when did they ever have ASIC stock?

@_date: 2013-05-02 01:57:38
Yeah thanks, I sent them an email too
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:35:17
I don't think it was longer than 24hours to have the payment method verified. Is your account verified?
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:37:54
no problem, I've just learnt they only deal with orders upto $500. but still haven't heard from them.
@_date: 2013-02-24 14:02:57
You can be any player, player 1 and 2 can play straight away, player 3 can not play (decide) until the bets placed by player 1 and 2 are confirmed. 
@_date: 2013-02-24 20:20:32
They could be both players or even all 3 players, but it doesn't give any advantage. 
When play 3 decides the cups are shuffled so the order has changed. 
@_date: 2013-02-25 00:19:56
You need to wait until Player 1 and Player 2 have made bets, then a link will show up under the status column call 'Decide now'.
@_date: 2013-02-06 04:57:22
jesus christ who is the unknown pool?
I always thought the point of a mining pool was to get a better and more consistent payout.
So in theory it would best to go with the largest or most powerful pool?
@_date: 2013-02-10 11:06:42
Thanks mate, love your site!
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:17:04
seems amateurish, they need a WWW A record in their DNS
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:36:07
I asked about buying an Ultimaker a few weeks ago.
If it's a toy like a 3d printer and there was a good community trust in the seller I could wait a week before shipping, if this gives you enough time to convert the btc to something which can pay your bills. Hell we've waited longer for things...BFL
I would also be looking at Bitpay and seeing how fast they can pay or how it works.
@_date: 2013-05-07 05:17:31
Thanks for the feedback. I thought to be used as an incentive to keep the health of a torrent just above a minimum so that it stays alive a little longer.
Maybe a seeder can see a list of recent demand and start seeding again at some point.
It appears to me that a torrent is only healthy when it's a fad. Once the popularity drops then it can be hard to find a source.
@_date: 2013-05-02 00:46:09
Anyone else having trouble resetting their password? I get the reset token in my email but after clicking the link it tells me it has expired..
@_date: 2013-02-25 02:47:52
I've reduced the reserve time so you should see more opportunities 
@_date: 2013-04-16 23:44:06
I can login but I've been having problems sending btc.
