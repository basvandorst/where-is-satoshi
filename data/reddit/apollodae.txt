Probably easier to use the API. Apollo DAE will offer stop loss orders when we launch, if you can't get one to work on Binance.

On Apollo DAE, we won't drag our feet on decisions. If the community wants a coin added, we do it. (If we legally can). Apollodae.io

Apollo DAE would be the best place trading. But we won't be launching for another few months..

I wouldn't cash out. Just buy more coins that have a good team and future. ETH may go somewhere, civic, our ico, etc. If you need the cash though, cash out, pay the 30-40% in taxes and live on. Investing in multiple businesses and projects would be best however because you can write off losses, and if you gain more, then who cares if your tax bill is higher, you made more $$. - Not pro tax advice.

 "his experience at JPMorgan during the peak of the 2008 financial crash led him to think that blockchain could be the pivotal technology for establishing transparency and trust in the global economic system"

so basically the problem is with communication.
Also, there is value in convenience; which is what i think he's trying to say

@_date: 2018-07-01 22:40:41
