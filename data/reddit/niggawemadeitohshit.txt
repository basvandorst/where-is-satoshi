Don't tell them about our 1000CHF bills then!
@_date: 2014-07-28 08:52:23
 maybe? But be aware of scammers and ask for help first before you start to deal with online vendors.
What are the limitations on your bank account? For example, could you make an international payment to a private?
@_date: 2014-06-30 01:56:28
On one hand, it's always great to do stuff with you kid. If he enjoys making games with you and posting them online, great!
On the other hand, there are thousands of parents who go the ''my kid made this, money please''-way over here and it's pretty disgusting. You're going down the exact same way with your ''a 5y old making video games'' title. Don't market your kid ffs.
My tipp: spend time with your son doing what you both enjoy, post it online, but don't attach any 'business' to it. Don't ask for donations, don't try to sell anything. If you really believe that your kid should be rewarded for it by money, just send yourself a few dollars via btc and tell him that these were donations by fans of the site.
@_date: 2014-06-30 02:16:50
Yes, if you insist on bringing money and business into the life of a 5y old, that's what I'm saying. You can teach him all those lessons without having to act like all these parents who exploit their kids for money or attention (be it your intention or not, I don't know you, it's not the point). 
Look at it like Santa Claus, the tooth fairy, whatever. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 02:22:57
I don't see how any of this is wrong.
* not backed by government: check
* exchange rates are volatile: check
* hackers and scammers: check
Really, there's nothing wrong about warning people who have 0 clue that they should think twice before dumping their money into BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-18 13:18:22
No. Your CHF are lowered in value to not kill off the Swiss export economy. 
Also, to make rich people richer? Who are you talking about? This doesn't make any sense. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 12:15:12
Extremely improbable? You high? It's still more likely for BTC to crash than to make it another 5 years.
@_date: 2014-12-18 11:53:01
No. No swiss bank will apply negative interest rates to average customers. Won't happen 
@_date: 2014-05-05 18:50:03
You sound way too butthurt to be taken seriously. 
Try again, with less salt and proofs.

How many BTC/day is that?
@_date: 2014-12-12 18:01:11
Sorry, but that's simply untrue. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 09:20:06
Dude, it's $5. Except if you're from the Top20 poorest places on earth, it's not worth jumping through so many hoops for $5. Just buy a Humble Bundle someday and that's it.

Eh, no? The CHF is too strong, not too weak.

Yeah, sure, let's sponsor people who probably already know more about bitcoins than 90% of people on this sub. That makes sense. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 10:22:45
Are you asking for yourself or is it a general question?
@_date: 2014-05-24 03:24:22
No, there isn't. They will probably change their policies 10 times until then.

Does Switzerland look like Cyprus to you? Sorry for sounding dickish, but that's apples and oranges.

Yeah, because ''Apple'' knows certainly less about bitcoins than this sub does. Sure. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 08:59:03
Yet this comment section is full of people bashing Dogecoiners for their mentality, while it's the same fucking thing here. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 12:27:17
Two things:
* Add a ''What can I do with my BTC?'' section. Maybe link to some online vendors, a good how-to, etc. Here's a start:  
* Tip less often, but more money. What can one reasonably do with 5CHF in BTC in Switzerland?
@_date: 2014-08-21 15:31:41
Nice comment section.
@_date: 2014-12-18 13:22:57
Yes, they don't want it to go below 1.20, but they have a trouble in the world doing so. They have to massively buy foreign currencies, which sucks. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 02:10:37
You shouldn't. You really shouldn't. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 01:12:15
Sorry, no personal experience with US banks. Hollaback when you need help finding a good swiss bank though.
@_date: 2014-05-30 17:26:42
We will probably in like 5min.
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:41:49
You probably deleted it yourself. Apple only deletes stuff remotely in extreme cases and you would read it all over the news. Try loading an older backup.

Switzerland is not the US.

Using Paypal is never fine though. Sooner or later they will fuck you in the ass. It's only a matter of time.

Forget about this part. If a company runs with your coins, you're fucked. Don't expect to get any kind of money back.

@_date: 2014-12-18 16:20:54
Sorry, don't have the time to make an economics 101 with you. If you don't understand why an even higher CHF would hurt Switzerland then so be it.
@_date: 2014-05-24 03:25:28
It's not really new. You could find people complaining about it for weeks/months now. For me it's just a healthy reminder to keep my BTC safe as long as I don't trade them.
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:51:51
You know, the SNB keeping the CHF ''low'' is literally one of the only things everybody in Switzerland can agree on, from businesses to workers unions. It's beyond obvious that it's the right thing to do.

China doesn't like drug traffickers. Like, not at all.

Sorry, but if you're ''stereotypical american'-bad at geography, foreign politics and economics, I don't have enough time to explain it to you all. Just hit up wiki if you want to learn more about both countries.
@_date: 2014-12-18 14:36:48
That's such bullshit. If the SNB doesn't act the CHF goes through the roof and ten thousands of people lose their job. Your logic is absurd. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 19:45:35
Is this a lot of money for you? 
@_date: 2014-05-30 17:24:19
Can someone explain me how the Paypal scam goes? I knew it was a scam as soon as I saw the difference in prices between Paypal and the other options when buying my first btc, but I never really looked into it.
@_date: 2014-05-07 00:49:40
The whole point is to get non-techies involved. The MMA crowd is mostly young men, that's a perfect target audience for something like crypto currencies.

It makes a lot of sense that Las Vegas loves BTC. ''What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas'' shouldn't come with the annotation ''except for all the shit on your credit card bill''.

So you're telling me that everyone makes mistakes?

This comment section is beyond bad. I understand why exists now. Holy fuck.
@_date: 2014-12-18 13:21:25
No need to put it in another way. The CHF is pretty much the strongest currency around. If it wasn't kept artificially lower, its value would kill off Swiss industry. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:18:02
If this happens, how could this not crash the markets for a couple months?
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:17:06
The SNB did their job. I don't see any poor investment. They're not here to make money, but to keep price levels stable in Switzerland and if possible also currency rates. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:05:06

Banking secrecy will never disappear for Swiss nationals. Just don't count on it anymore if you're a foreigner and try to escape foreign tax institutions.

Yeah, that's bullshit.
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:20:26
I'm sorry, but that's bullshit. The 1.20 pegged price was unanimously welcomed by everyone from far left to right. It saved a lot of businesses and jobs during three years. 
People who say 'this is great for the Swiss consumer!' are idiots who think that 'CHF stronk = good' and have no fucking clue about basic economics. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:26:54
Political stability, fiscal stability, strong economy, major financial places (Zurich, Basel, Geneva), low debts, low unemployment, very secure country. And the list goes on and on. 
It's a great place to store your money and the CHF is a stable (...) and secure currency.

Investing 70% of income in anything is dumb. We all do dumb stuff and we're all free to do it, but at least acknowledge it.

2% is ridiculous for a system where you don't have any reason to pay back.
