yeah, but it's not really on the withdrawing side that I have trouble. I have a couple of solid services that do fast SEPA transfers at very low rates. It's getting money IN that's the bitch.

Whoops, that's what I get for writing in a hurry. :)
It's 3% +2% +$35.  Bank of America. Updated the post to reflect that.

Yeah, that's my current "best method."  unfortunately kraken does all its incoming wire processing by hand, so there's a 10 day delay after however long the wire took (3 days, typically). Add the 4 days of SEPA and you have an 18 day delay in your money. That's quite hard to budget with, and it's certainly worth $30 to get the money sooner in many cases.

Are you using bitcoin to transfer money internationally? Cause bitcoin sucks for that. It's very hard to transfer more than $1k within a week... Any more than that and some of your money will be waiting for days while the coin price fluctuates. 
The best deal is Currencyfair and similar sites. Same day wire transfer into your cf account (can be free depending on your bank), exchange currency instantly with EXTREMELY good exchange rates (within 0.5% of market, in my experience), then wire transfer out. I can get my money from my US Bank account to an EU one within 6 hours for 8€, at a fantastic exchange rate. 
I am not an employee of currency fair or any related firm. But I use it every month to transfer my paycheck, and it saves me on average 300€ per month in exchange rate and bank fees.
