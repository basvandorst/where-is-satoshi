He didn't understand the problem, that's why he asked just now. You seem to be just as divisive as the BU shills. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:28:36
yea they would since you dont prove negatives
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:52:55


That is what he said though?
@_date: 2017-03-28 09:54:22
Because hopefully other people reading the thread see his ignorant comment and rather than seeing no reply and possibly thinking that means he is correct will see the multitude of information related to LN and learn something new.

Yes terms for new things are made up by the developers of said new things? Are WAN and LAN the same because a network is a network? They are terms that have had well defined definitions for years now, and bodies of research have been done in relation to those definitions.

Except they don't both work. Ignoring BU's awful implementation, the entire idea of EC does not work. That said, this sub and core supporters can be just as toxic at times as and BU supporters. This kind of toxicity just further drives people away from reconciliation.

How is that not the same? And some companies ARE avoiding new york and the license by not allowing any NY residents to be customers?

Soft fork is a term that has meaning unrelated the contentiousness of the fork. A fork is soft or hard depending on how the protocol is changed, regardless of community support. 
You're right it seems at this point both BU and SW are contentious but,


This is statement is ignorant at best or disingenuous at worst. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:34:32
It doesn't mean nothing either though

No it appears the design is patented.  
Also even if the design wasn't pattented this requires hardware level implementation, which means a development cycle and then production of new exploiting asics.
The bug isn't in bitcoin code as said but rather in the sha2 hashcash algorithm
@_date: 2017-04-03 11:55:00
Or possibly reading a dismissal filled with misinformation and FUD on instead. If one isn't familiar with the technical aspects of bitcoin, its easy to see how one could believe some of their arguments.
@_date: 2017-04-06 02:50:41
I mean the original comment needlessly attacking
@_date: 2017-04-07 00:37:44
Except that his patent was requested in late 2015 and ASICBOOST wasn't announced until march 2016? How did he steal the patent before they announced it. It seems like jihan had researchers who independently developed the improvement. He's done a lot of things wrong, there's no need to add additional false things to make him look worse.
EDIT: this is apparently wrong
@_date: 2017-04-06 01:00:25
Karpeles wasn't just grossly, horribly incompetent he was a thief.
@_date: 2017-04-27 02:45:06
I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss asic resistance in general. But you're correct its flawed in its current state.
In my view the key to asic resistance the development of an asic that offers a meaningful advantage, also corresponds to developing a product more valuable than control of the network. In the current stage of asic-resistance that would be a new form of memory. Selling the memory would be more profitable than using it to control the network. 
But this in turn does put a cap on the network value to that of the market for the coinciding product. I believe there is a solution to this problem, it isn't impossible, but it will take some very bright minds to come up with a solution.
@_date: 2017-04-06 03:09:40
What he did is certainly immoral and I support the suggested change to stop covert usage of this, since it is a design bug rather than an improvement in circuit design. I am fully against BU, and would love to see Jihan exit the community. But the idea that it is as bad as what gox/karpeles did seems absurd.
He developed efficient technology in the same way Steve Jobs developed the iphone. As far as I can tell Timo Hanke / Sergio Lerner never produced any chips, only described the process and Jihan is the first person to develop a real world implantation. (Whether or not he should have been granted the chinese patent is another question entirely) 
Maybe there is a gap in my understanding so feel free to correct me, but I don't see how a more efficient standard chip design is less of a secret unbalancing than this implementation of asicboost, other than asicboost being a bigger leap forward. Is there any harm to the PoW / block creation if every miner was using asicboost exploiting chips? If not then surely the development of the first asic's vs gfx card mining would be a bigger harm to bitcoin, since it gave the asic holders a massive advantage in efficiency?
@_date: 2017-04-06 01:55:49
What does your comment add to the discussion?
@_date: 2017-04-06 03:58:36
The BIP does not cripple the hardware, it just requires them to signal.
@_date: 2017-04-06 01:01:57
There's no need for attacking peoples appearances. Especially unprovoked as with Vitalik. You're only contributing to toxicity that drives a wedge in the community.
@_date: 2017-04-06 03:24:38
I only made the apple comparison because I misunderstood your original comment as trying to say that Jihan wasn't the developer, apologies. 
As far as the second part of your comment are you alleging that the ant miners Bitmain sells to customers are not exploiting asicboost and that Bitmain has an additional 20-30% efficiency on top of the advertised rate? I assumed (possibly incorrectly it was just an assumption) that they would have used that speedup to make their miners more attractive to sell as well.
Also I still am not sure how other than asicboost being a greater step forward for one change it differs from a trade secret say 14nm construction vs 16nm. If only one company has a more efficient 14 nm chip they have tilted the playing field in their favor until other manufacturers produce 14 nm chips. Why is asicboost different, surely now that the cat is out of the bag other manufacturers will produce asicboost exploiting chips for their next generation miners?
@_date: 2017-04-06 03:42:34
I agree that Bitmain has way too much influence over mining. I'm still unsure if you're right though about them having an advantage over the antminers that they sell though. Your argument is logical though, so I don't necessarily think you're wrong just that neither of us seem to have more than speculation. Since no mechanism for enabling/disabling use of asicboost was described by Greg Maxwell (If you or anyone has any evidence one way or the other I would love to see it though)
And after this clarification I fully agree with you I think. I also would like to see asic resistant PoW in the future, but have been a bit on edge about it based on comments here. I've seen lots of people calling for rapid changes to PoW, in an attempt to ruin bitmain's current asics, without realizing that they have the most capital in the community to rapidly develop an asic for new PoW which would give them an even larger edge.
EDIT: I would like to also add I'm glad that real research into asic-resistance is being done.
@_date: 2017-04-06 01:57:26
Is there any evidence this is what is happening? Surely a 30% margin in advertised vs actual hash rates would be easily detectable. I understood it as ALL antminers both his and the ones he sells are exploiting this, and he also used the benefit to sell more miners. So anyone with an antminer is also exploiting this. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 01:22:09
I'm not sure if anyone other than bitmain or gmaxwell know with regards to segwit but in this proposal asicboost can still be used as long as miners flag that they are using asicboost so there will be no change other than the secrecy of the attack. This is just speculation on my part, but I would suspect they will not become just bricks though, because it seems extremely foolhardy for them to have invested so much in these miners if rather than becoming 25% less efficient became 100% less efficient once detected. If it was going to turn them to bricks that would explain even more so why jihan would want to block.
@_date: 2017-04-06 02:59:42
The patent linked here describes the asicboost exploit as far as I can tell. So he hasn't violated chinese IP law (Which I do know is basically a joke) I don't know enough about the law, or the technical details of asicboosts patent vs jihan's to say whether it really is IP theft. But regardless I still see karpeles theft of users money as a greater act of immorality than this.
Please don't take this as me defending or supporting Jihan, I don't. I just feel that what Mark Karpeles did is MUCH worse, and people are downplaying it because it's a some what distant memory by now.
@_date: 2017-04-06 01:43:19
He hasn't broken bitcoin in any way, hes simply delayed segwit, what permanent damage has he caused? He acted immorally but not as immorally as theft.
@_date: 2017-04-07 01:01:33
Apologies, I couldn't find the actual patent, I was basing my claim on the fact that the asicboost whitepaper and twitter were both publish/created in March 2016, and the whitepaper said the patent was pending. Not sure why their 2016 paper claims the patent is pending if it was granted in early 2015. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 04:11:43
Look at the date on the patent bitmain filed. I was incorrect in my previous reply to me, it seems that bitmain independently developed this boost. They filed for the patent months before asicboost did, how could they have stolen the IP?
@_date: 2017-04-06 00:59:39
Karpeles stole peoples money. Jihan developed a more efficient technology, and then acted against the best interest of the majority to preserve his advantage. Are Jihans' actions immoral? Almost certainly by most sets of morals. Are they the same as theft? No.

In the future it's better to use services such as  in addition to screenshots for better proof such tweets aren't faked.
@_date: 2017-04-06 14:37:04
Jihan's patent was issued before ASICBOOST, it doesn't seem that hes acting illegally, points 2 and 3 are correct though.
@_date: 2017-04-06 03:14:28
Yes exactly. He is losing his margin, which he fought to persevere through immoral use of his influence, and as a result he will lose his influence (or some at least). He undoubtedly temporarily hurt bitcoin, but the people who lost coins as a result of Karpeles were permanently hurt and lost coins forever.
