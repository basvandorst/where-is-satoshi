The period  contracts are mostly for people who want to test mining hardware performance before they buy it. The lifetime contracts are used to bring people into cloud mining, they cost more then if you buy it directly from them in BTC, so the only advantages are if you use it as a gift certificate to give away to somebody, or if you want to easily acquire BTC without opening an online wallet and going through bank and identity verifications, as you can easily trade the Giga hashes contract for BTC later.

That is the sole concern about quantum computers.  They will be able to quickly crack encrypted information.

Good point, it should be 99% since error rate is even lower

You may never get your ROI in PB mining, where in cex.io you can sell or trade your Giga hashes. HashQuest is another cloud mining service startup similar to cex.io opening around october.

Large companies accepting BTC is the aswer.  BTC buyers tend to hold on to it for much linger where the companies accepting it cashes out quickly due to the volatility of the currency.  Consumers need to stop spending BTC on large companies.

Bitcoin is a *reburstable* buble. It bubbles up, bursts and bubbles up again :p

I use Cryptsy.com as a multi coin wallet. They are a network for trading in between currencies with support for about 50 alt coins. Only thing is minimum withdraw of 0.01 BTC with 0.00005 tranfer fee. But you could also look into BTer.com and coins-e.com trading networks.

You should be worried only if you're still using Windows XP pre - SP3 versions. In witch case, you're past due an upgrade regardless.

Mining hardware could still be useful for mining other coins. Within the next few months Bitcoin mining on a small scale will become completely impractial. In every type of investments there are risks, so the risk here is whether alt coin mining will remain profitable as it is now.
Remember that as mining difficulty increases and it becomes less profitable its likely that there will be less mining witch will then slow down the increase in difficulty, but this also means that there will be more alt coin mining.

You don't want amazon to accept bitcoins, it would just be another major corporation to periodically dump coins cause market cap drops.

Too bad you can't buy a house with bitcoins, yet.

People were hoarding bitcoins for a while, but for a lot of the time the need for bitcoins was for purchasing things that could not be purchased with other methods, giving bitcoins a bad name since the product sold for bitcoins may not have been legal. Bitcoins improved it's reputation with all the credible merchants embracing it, but the side effect was all the dumping those merchants do will keep the price down, and buyers won't buy more bitcoins just to shop with the big merchants when standard payment methods are also accepted.

I would advise you not invest on bitcoins, just based on the fact that you're asking this question.
