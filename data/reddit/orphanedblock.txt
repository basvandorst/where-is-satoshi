 When opinions are so clearly divided, both sides will have a good case to make. Which ever side wins this the other should accept it and move on.
In the end it will be a consensus between all parties that decide the real bitcoin. Saying the miners have all the power or devs have all the power is just an illusion. The devs carnt get the miners to run whatever they want and the miners can only run the software that wont destroy their investment.
The transactions will all (except speculation) go with one chain and that will be bitcoin.

Well done for leaving this post up.

Bitcoin is its transactions. Where the transactions go, that is bitcoin. The real transactions will not split there will be a small amount of speculative transactions on the non bitcoin side but not more. Calling unlimitedcoin corecoin ect ect is just noise the market will make a definitive decision.

If that is the prevailing attitude then there will be a HF. The majority of the mining security will go with BU and so will the businesses, apart from the exchanges who can list two coins, the businesses can only pick one. Be in no doubt they will follow the majority of mining power. The transactions and the value will then follow the businesses. Core coin will end up on a low value chain with no transactions (apart from speculation). If thats what you want, keep you head in the clouds.

Its in no ones interest to have two bitcoins. When opinions are so clearly divided, both sides will have a good case to make. Which ever side wins this the other should accept it and move on.

Its not BU that we need to compromise with, its the miners. The hongkong agreement was a compromise of segwit activation with code written for a 2mb hard fork. That may still be enough i dont know but I hope conversations are happening. All this stalemate is going to do is turn and alt into competition. How high do fees have to get before the dark web prefers Monero over BTC, before gambling sites decides to take Dash ect ect. This could be a very slippery slope.

POW wont change - it just isn't a clever move its a desperate one.
1 whatever you use will be vastly less secure in number hashes
2 value will flow to most secure chain
3 New POW will give BU more credibility as the true BTC
4 You would have to shit on the miners that support segwit making them instant supporters of BU
I know is old fashioned but the only was this is going to be solved is by the real players getting together and talking. Maybe they are doing it. I hope so

With due respect 18% starting in 7 years isnt even in the direction of finding middle ground.
With regard to it being spam taking us to 1mb. Conspiracy theory's aside no one is going throw that much money at damaging something they are clearly heavily invested in.

here here, well said. Thanks to everyone who hodls BTC whatever your views
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:52:51
Ill kick off with a wacky one. Reduce the block time to 5 mins by soft fork and implement segwit at same time. This would increase on chain by about 4x and avoid a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-29 09:39:15
Totally agree, whats with all the negativity? It can only be good for bitcoin, especially while we are in this deadlock. If you dont like it dont use it.
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:10:26
I dont believe that but if you are right then we are at stalemate and value will continue to flow to the most promising alts
@_date: 2017-03-06 12:16:00
I said conspiracy theory's aside. There is no evidence that Ver had more invested in alts than he does in bitcoin. If you have some please share otherwise its just manipulation.
Middle ground is obviously no change. How is this obvious and whats the evidence that we should be reducing the block? 
Im a supporter of segwit and core but as I see it your arguments are unrealistic and just help BU

Was that a guess? I carnt find any evidence of them selling for that much. I found one on offer for 0.1 bitcoin a few years ago. More than that i dont see. If you can back up your valuation please send a link. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:49:24
I said it was a wacky one, the idea of this post was to see what ideas people had
@_date: 2017-03-11 11:26:44
Agreed but not until we pick a path for scaling..
@_date: 2019-03-09 17:19:10
Realy.....? wow. I guess I will get a print.
@_date: 2017-01-26 08:34:29
Its not the core devs that activate.
@_date: 2017-01-25 23:08:30
Do I need to be someone to have an opinion? I got interested in bitcoin summer of 2013 just after the bubble. Did some GPU mining on LTC to convert to BTC  bought some BTC and have spent an hour or two a day lurking reading and watching anything Bitcoin ever since. Im approaching 50 have run several business some failed some did well. Will that do you?
@_date: 2017-01-25 23:20:42
I understand that and its what worries me. On they are deluded and paranoid and over here you are too complacent. Simple fact is that too much power resides in too few hands and those hands are not Cores. Failure to recognize and work with this unfortunate situation is the biggest threat to BTC. It wont be the best developers that win it will be the ones that work with these powerful players. I have faith that in the future mining will decentralize again. There are power plants with excess capacity all over the world but for now this is where we are and if we dont face it we may as well just hand over to BU now.
@_date: 2017-01-25 23:28:23
Im not pointing fingers this is a group complacency problem. You think protecting is refusing to do anything but the best thing, sounds good but only if you can dictate and in this case not only can we not dictate but we have lost the confidence of the two people who to some extent can.

Here here, well said, lets just get past this. Adam even on reddit and r/bitcoin at that, this comment has risen to the top. Segwit plus 2mb hard fork 2 years activation, make it happen dude.
