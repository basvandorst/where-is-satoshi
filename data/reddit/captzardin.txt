I don't know what those TLRs mean.

What exchange should I use though?? No one is telling me
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:06:34
TIL, thanks i didn't know.

Yep,I bet there are a lot of people with auto sell at $10k...it's a milestone people will be happy to bail on.

it's asking me to verify to T3...but I'm working away from home at the moment and can't...having no mobile phone has been a nightmare for verification reasons with multiple websites.

Anyone? Where's the best place to sell btc cash for btc? I'm being legitimately honest here and people are downvoting me.

I found out I can do it directly from the blockchain website. Had to put in 25 orders though as there's a max of B Cash that you can exchange at one time. 
I'm taking about a £10 hit on each order, not too bothered as it was free anyway.

I did it through them via Blockchain.info. There was literally a built in feature, i didn't know...it wasn't working 2 days ago which is very...very annoying.

How the hell do change my Bitcoin cash to BTC...thought I could do it on Kraken by transferring from my blockchain.info wallet. 
Kraken wont give me a deposit address
Never mind, found out there was a way to directly exchange on blockchain wallet. Cheers anyway guys.

For what??
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:35:02
And if I knew what I was doing, I'd do something about it. I just bought early and forgot about it. I don't really care about my holdings because the plan has always been to hold until it's easier for me to put back in to GDP.

I don't really follow bitcoin much, I've been a holder for 5 years and used blockchain wallet. 
Used to play around with alts back when litecoin was the silver standard. I lost a fair bit on Quark coin and mined a shit load of ripple back when you could use your computer to help some science research foundation. been out of the loop for the last 3 years though. Just did some digging about Bitcoin's fork recently and learned i had a bunch of them...gutted i couldn't exchange them 2 days ago though.

Noobie quotation here but why are we not and allot or taking 15 minutes to confirm....will it be quicker in the future?
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:52:54
how many? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:59:38
I've got 6BCH from blockchain wallet, just found out today...Don't know whether to hodl or sell.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:56:36
I have a few thousand ripple too, an investing thing to look into to.

@_date: 2017-07-09 20:31:36
I could really do with that money op...let's not play games, send me a pm. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:33:04
Really? It would completely strip the anonymity of btc though.
