There is a difference which needs to be addressed here.
Buy within the BRD is buying OTC(over the counter). Its like a shop.
Buying with an exchange brings in to the starting steps of trading. Which is good as well. 
OTC models with creditcard are always expensive in comparision to OTC models with ither payment methods like banktransfer. Bank transfer rates can go as low as 1%.
Most important thing for you is.. in which region do you live and which services are offering OTC services there.
Buying at an exchange is always an option offcourse.

The fee is determined by the means of payment. If you use a creditcard.. the fees will be around those percentages almost everywhere as scammers buy and do a chargeback on creditcards.
If you are in the US, the BRD app has a second option with very competitive fees.
And if not in the US.. then indeed tradional exchanges will give you way better rates. Buy there and transfer your BTC asap to the BRD wallet.
Welcome to the crypto universe btw.

The BRD app indeed needs to be synced up for BTC for the funds to become available.
The app downloads the most recent block info while syncing to show you the most updated info.
What I do is plug my phone to a charger and let the BRD app sync up while I watch a movie or whatever.

Right, I don’t think people accept btc in salary if they don’t have a stable financial situation.
You shouldn’t be worried about these situations to be able to start accepting btc as a salary.

I use the BRD(formally known as Bread) wallet as my primary means of storing my Crypto.
For me its the best as its has multiple options as a user:
Onramp- buy Crypto with money.
Offramp- is coming soon.
In-app trading- lots if trading options.
Rewards- BRD wallet will be starting their perks and rewards program soon which will benefit users of the app.
Quick email support- Average response time is under 2 hours.
Direct phone support- this will be releasing soon as well. As far as I know.. its the only crypto related company which will be providing this worldwide.
Constant partnerships to bring more value to its userbase.
ICO checkout- Use the app to take part in selected ICOs directly.
At the end of the day its the best wallet for beginners who want to start their crypto experience and the app is still evolving and improving everyday.
Its mostly its a personal preference. Try it out... is my advice.

Most hacks are on phones? That is something I am not aware of. I work in IT and thats not true. 
Please give me a few examples were it’s presented that smartphones are hacked more than your PC?
I am very curious.

Thats a sim swap attack. Using BRD would have saved this guy.
You do not have an account with BRD. Its completely decentralized.

The advice from Brainddk is great.
Additionally you can also try the BRD app on your smartphone.
As long as you have your recovery keys.. you will be fine and spending is easier on a mobile wallet instead of a hardware wallet.
Everyone has their preferred way. Give it a test run and decide for yourself which option fits your style.

BRD app. Give it a try.
@_date: 2019-08-24 08:30:19
Indeed, BRD cannot allow are block any transactions.

I use BRD. Its a wallet for your smart phone. Simple and easy in use. Other than that it lets you buy and trade crypto as wel. All from within the app being decentraized in storage.
Try it out and let me know if you have any questions��.
@_date: 2019-04-10 11:10:32
Good luck together. Wishing you guys lots of happiness��
@_date: 2019-04-12 08:43:57
Indeed a scam. Stay safe
@_date: 2019-04-10 11:07:23
Yeh might be. If you are looking for that.. then indeed.
BRD is non-custodial which means no one other than you have custody over your crypto. Buy, store and trade is possible all within the all. Trustless and decentralized.
Wirex is totally something else. 
You give them your crypto and they promise you that you can spend it. Trustbased and centralized.
Choices depend on what is most important to you��.
Good luck.

BTC = Deflationary.
Stablecoin pegged to FIAT = Inflationary = Shitcoin
Don’t forget about censorship resistance.
Any coin which is control by a central party is doomed to get corrupted because of greed.

Try using the BRD app before making that purchase��
