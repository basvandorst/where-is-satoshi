The way they run their hot wallet and cold storage it's pretty difficult to get any accurate numbers like this for them

Good question, I don't know when the various cash node repos were originally forked

Your argument of not being there because they're an idiot is not an argument. You've said nothing in that paragraph.
What does asicboost have to do with anything? Can't that be used on both just fine?

So far, BCH has removed SegWit, raised the block size, and implemented a new difficulty adjustment algorithm. They'll soon be adding back op codes that were removed from BTC awhile back. 
Those are the primary differences I'm aware of.

You could get your parents to purchase it online at a place like Coinbase and then transfer it to your wallet

Coinbase is built for people getting started with Bitcoin. It has a solid reputation and is an established US based company and has insurance on digital and fiat assets you store with them.
The downside of using their wallet is that you don't control the private keys to your digital currency. So when things like these girls happen, depending on what they decide, you could have trapped value there you can't get out yet. This is the current situation with Bitcoin Cash, though support for that is expected early January. If Coinbase wanted to be malicious, they could take your coins from you or he government could instruct them to not allow you access. 
The most secure option is to transfer them to your own wallet that you have the private keys for, there's lots of resources on setting those up. Coinbase provides more convenience for the trade-off of not completely controlling your coins.

Not on Coinbase. Price you see when you buy is what you pay.

Coinbase will handle all this for you if you don't want to do anything. The blog posts describe this a bit.
If you want full control over everything, transfer it to your own wallet. 
Though then you then have to find software to split the coins and do that since s2x doesn't have replay protection. Coinbase is planning to do that for you.
Having it on Coinbase will also make it easier to sell post fork if that's what you want.
You sacrifice full control for that convenience, so it's up to you to decide what's more important. You could always transfer it off after to not deal with all the fork stuff.

There should be fees for any on chain transaction if your wallet provides them. It could set them to zero, but that would take awhile to confirm, if ever.

Of course it does. There's multiple node active implementations that have coordinated together on multiple changes now, including an upcoming scheduled hard fork. Hard to do that without devs.
And the whole BCH is Bitcoin I see more as a philosophy thing than anything else. From all the changes they've made for it to look different and not be confusing it doesn't seem to be a major focus of the majority. There's always going to be outliers who do, but the majority I've met don't and don't support pushing that idea because of the issues out creates.

Newcomers should read this as a way not to behave or share information. Not to learn about the differences between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.
Bitcoin Cash is fork of Bitcoin that made tradeoffs to scale the way they want to and Bitcoin can scale however it wants to.
They use different tickers, different name, different address format, different core devs. It's just...different.
