Valid. But even looking at the actual block size, we didn't hit the limit until April 2016. Again, where was the spam?
@_date: 2017-02-18 17:28:04
Confidential Transactions (where tx amounts are encrypted) has been successfully implemented in Elements. Would you support bringing Confidential Transactions to Bitcoin?
Background: The cost of privacy would be larger tx sizes--up to ~6KB/tx. Since coin tumbling and shuffling would not be needed anymore, some of this "wasted" space in the blockchain could presumably be saved and offset the larger tx. Privacy has many benefits, for example allowing a publicly traded company to keep their financial activity private. Privacy may also has some downsides such as increased pressure from governments.

Appreciation for the developers is a must. Bitcoin is nothing without them.
But it goes the other way too. The users matter and contribute to value through the network effect. Let's not pretend we can chase off users and maintain growth.
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:08:39
I agree, but what's the collateral damage?
Look at the historical block size: 
We are *just now* hitting capacity, so we have no idea what the fallout will be. How long can bitcoin businesses operate at a loss before going belly up? Once you lose merchants and users how hard will to be to get them back? If the pain hits 6 months after the problem arises, you shouldn't rely on pain to force change.
Look at this chart: 
As block sizes have slowly grown, fees have remained relatively flat. But now we are entering unprecedented territory. We should be trying to get out in front of the issue, not waiting for problems to hit before acting.
@_date: 2017-02-08 13:22:06

I've directly disagreed with moderators in several post without any issues. I'm not categorically saying, "there is no censorship." I said, "*I have not personally witnessed any censorship*."
I'm just giving people one data point which is actually factual, instead of speculating on the entire state of affairs.

Very interesting. Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:02:34
Why would it crash really soon? Speculation can prop up the price for months before people decide that growth is being stonewalled.
Plus, if SegWit *does* get adopted there is no reason for a crash. Current prices are fair since there is a decent chance that improvements will be pushed through.
@_date: 2017-02-08 13:54:53


Who said anything about letting miners decide the block size? I said, *modestly increase transaction capacity*. The crazy thing is if you look back just one year people were debating whether to increase the block size to 2MB, 8MB, or 32MB. Now, apparently, the sky will fall if we bump things up *at all*.


It's not just coffee. There are a 1001 bitcoin applications which get priced out of the market if fees rise too quickly. That's a tangible risk, unlike decentralization.
EDIT: source, 
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:23:18
The network is supposed to *function* in a decentralized manner. Network *design* has always been, and will always be centralized.
Get the top 10 developers and the top 10 mining pool operators and you can do anything with the design. It's the function, not the design that is decentralized.
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:20:01
From the Satoshi white paper: "The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions"
Oops...looks like bitcoin became the monster it was fighting.
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:14:19
So responsible growth equals zero growth? There is no inherent problem with zero growth, it's just aiming really low compared to what bitcoin could be.
Within the last couple weeks we are just now hitting the ceiling in terms of number of transactions. Without change, we literally and mathematically will have zero growth in terms of transactions.
Then the price gets bit up to $10/$20 per transaction and bitcoin becomes a niche high priced service. I don't pretend to define what bitcoin should become, but in my inconsequential opinion, that's a sad place for the amazing technology of bitcoin to settle.
It's design choices, not technical limitations which is dictating transaction capacity.
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:56:54
The math is out there for everyone to see. Why do we have to chase off half the bitcoin user base just to prove to ourselves the obvious? The average transaction is over $1000 so the big fish will have no problem paying 1-2% fees. Supply is fixed, demand is increasing.
Maybe people buying a sandwich for $5 aren't directly funding the network *right now*, but there is value to having them in the ecosystem. In the future, scale can help the economics. What's the cost of having the little fish on board? Almost nothing. It's a low risk, high reward proposition. On the flip side, you have the high risk option of cutting lose a bunch of users and hoping the big fish *alone* are able to keep the system afloat.
@_date: 2017-02-08 04:56:08
Yup, I overstated my point. A lot of things have gotten better. But too bad that some basic things have gotten worse.
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:51:03
My point is that we need growth in the number of users right now to increase the network effect. Otherwise the current price cannot be sustained. In that scenario, even if fees rise significantly miners will come out behind.
Fees don't matter right now, because miners get over 90% of their revenue from the block reward. The only reason to have fees is to reduce spam transactions. Yes, over time fees will have to take over but that's years and years away.
Bitcoin is resilient so it will be fine in the long term. I'm just worried we are about to set back growth 5 years for no reason. The bottom line is that the market bid up the price to $1050/BTC assuming SegWit and all that would go through, so let's not assume we can maintain the price without scaling. That's the whole point of my post.
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:23:16
Correction on my part: someone informed me not to look at *average* block size, but *median* block size. Looks like we actually started maxing out April 2016.
Yeah, it doesn't seem quite so dire then. I need to go back to the data and try to make sense of it.
Do you have any insight as to why fees are really starting to grow fast starting ~Jan 20, 2017?
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:56:16
Miners make over 90% of their revenue from the block reward. Fees are peanuts. They should be more concerned with the exchange rate which has real impact on their bottom line.


What about the number of transactions running into a hard limit? That's never happened before. Fees have never been over $1/transaction. These are changes that are rapidly coming that miners shouldn't ignore.
@_date: 2017-02-07 07:33:30
So bitcoin is willingly sacrificing an enormous portion of monetary transaction market share? This is an absurd strategy. There is no technical limitation to modestly increasing transaction volume--only arbitrary limits. It's really hard to get new users, and even harder to get former, disgruntled user back after they leave.
Transaction fees don't finance the miners. The block reward coupled with a high BTC exchange rate does that. The whole system is being propped up by growth, and you want to decrease the user base?
*The market share for the features you describe is tiny.* If that's the moon people are talking about we passed the moon and need to head back. Say bitcoin does $200 million in volume/day and 200,000 transactions/day at 5% fees. That's $50/transaction so $3.65 billion in annual fees. I don't know the price of electricity in China, but let's just give a valuation of $10 billion. That's like $625/BTC. Also, I'm being very generous to assume transaction volume won't drop if fees go over $50/transaction.
What's wrong with bitcoin being a free, fair, decentralized, secure, uncensored version of PayPal? That's what people have been waiting for it to become, and the only reason the price is being bid up to $1000-$1200. If bitcoin scales properly, it could go really high. I'm rooting for that scenario.
@_date: 2017-02-07 02:42:26

@_date: 2017-02-07 21:11:24
The average transaction is around $1100 right now, but I would love to see the transaction amount distribution. Anyone have a link to that?
@_date: 2017-02-08 13:51:56
Haha, I love how we have to express the price on a log scale.
I'm extremely bullish on bitcoin in the long term, but that doesn't mean it's not overpriced at the moment. Let's have some reasonable expectations here. Sure, if you plan to buy and hold for 10 years go ahead--you are going to make money. You just may not be getting the best price at this particular moment.
I care much more about the underlying fundamentals, than the price which is largely driven by speculation right now. I'm looking at transaction volume, exchange volume, total transaction fees collected, health of the network, merchant adoption, etc. If the price is growing significantly faster than these metrics, I personally and going to pump the breaks. Everyone has their own strategy though!
@_date: 2017-02-15 19:01:25


Does this mean the range proof would just be done to validate a transaction before including in a block, but not stored into the transaction?
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:32:44
You know more about the code than me, so I'm interested in your opinion. Knowing everything we know now, if you took a time machine back to 2008 how would you handle the block size limit in the beginning?
Storage and bandwidth capacities are constantly changing so why does 1MB happen to be the magic number? If someone did a really detailed calculation and came up with 1.1MB or 0.9MB being the perfect block size I would be a lot more comfortable. 1MB is too arbitrary...it can't be the "right" answer.
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:02:45
Exchanges are the worst thing about bitcoin. Just tossing that out there.
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:14:38
Did you look at the chart? In 9 years, we never (or rarely) hit the block limit. Where has all the spam been? Maybe there is some other code which prevents spam. I'm not sure.
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:16:53
Very insightful. Thanks.


So people are actively negotiating with the miners? Core knows their shit in terms of the code, but their PR sucks.
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:32:13
Okay, let's look at the numbers then. Bitcoin has around a $16.5 billion market cap and ~$50 million in annual revenue (fees). That's a price to earnings ratio of 330. That is only sustainable if rapid growth is expected. If growth is blocked, *the price has to eventually correct down*, and price matters.
At current prices, a US miner makes $14,000/block. Say fees double but the exchange rate drops 20%. Now the miner only makes $12,200/block. Miners shouldn't give a shit about the fees until the block reward drops. Right now, revenue is predicated on the strength of the currency and the health of the network.
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:22:33
Not exactly. Step 1 should be figure out a reasonable transaction limit that the network can handle by looking at storage and bandwidth requirements. Step 2 is allow the fee market to take over. We need a block limit, just not a tiny one which was arbitrarily set a long time ago during different times.
@_date: 2017-02-08 13:04:38
Bitcoin is up $63 this week, $111 this month, $340 over the last 3 months. We are in a huge bull market.

@_date: 2017-02-07 22:02:36
Well, that clears that up.
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:24:08


To pay $1000/BTC is to roll the dice hoping for SegWit to be activated soon. If bitcoin scales, $1000/BTC is a bargain. If the status quo is maintained, we will see a correction.
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:09:28
In your case, it sounds like the bottom 40% of your customers were costing you so you cut them loose. That's a savvy move. Bitcoin, at this moment, is totally different. It doesn't cost the network anything to hold onto the small value transactions. They are just future potential.
Say we cut out the bottom 50% of transactions. There is almost no savings. Miners use the same amount of electricity regardless, which is the real cost of running the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-02-07 01:55:41
Out of curiosity, what percent of $1000/BTC do you believe is due to speculation versus transaction value?
@_date: 2017-02-06 21:31:03
This is where, I believe, the insiders have it wrong. Bitcoin only gains value if it can scale. The current price is propped up by speculation, and doesn't reflect current utility. Expected future scalability is priced into $1000/BTC. Many of the ancillary businesses which really make bitcoin special will get priced out of the market at $5/transaction. Ancillary businesses *are* vital to bitcoin. Without exchanges, mobile wallets, and merchants who accept bitcoin, we are back to 2009. A cool, novelty tech with very limited application. The average user will never run a full node with Bitcoin Core. Period.
Back to timing. The block size increase and segwit was supposed to happen a long time ago. Delays are setting back progress and turning away users (growth). This could set us back 5-10 years. Some merchants who previously accepted bitcoin do not anymore due to increasing delays and fees. Many business models required segwit.
Make no mistake, bitcoin is a brilliant technology. But that does not guarantee success. A lot of brilliant ideas have failed. I guess it's popular to bash Mike Hearn, but he had a point--he understood that scalability was essential to the success of bitcoin (and priced into the current exchange rate). I desperately hope he is ultimately wrong, and the community gets it shit together to properly allow scaling.
Here is the critical point devs and miners don't seem to get: maintaining the status quo transaction limit does not maintain the status quo exchange rate. *Doing nothing actually regresses the state of the tech, and will eventually drive down the price.* We can't be arrogant to think without mass adoption the price will magically rise due to sound, technical underpinnings.
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:37:54
These are the really cool things that can come from scaling the transaction limit (thereby reducing fees). Right now if my friend orders pizza, I reimburse him with Venmo (powered by PayPal). It's a free instant transaction.
Look at the first paragraph of the Satoshi white paper. Bitcoin was supposed to be faster and cheaper than existing methods, but bitcoin is getting beat at it's own game. That same transaction on bitcoin would cost $0.25 (~5%) and take an hour. That's not a favorable trade off. In totality, bitcoin is head and shoulders above other altcoins, but in some key areas it is lagging.
I'll be patient if this gets fixed in the next 6-12 months, but the sentiment I'm getting from people on this sub is that "that's not what bitcoin is for", or "fees need to go to $20/transaction to finance miners and prevent spam" That's what is concerning.
@_date: 2017-02-08 05:05:03
+1 for breadwallet. Really quality software.
@_date: 2017-02-07 01:39:32


I agree. It's bitcoin or nothing for the foreseeable future. That's why I hope bitcoin scales.


I don't see it this way. From what I can gather, the 1MB block limit was not part of the original plan and was somewhat arbitrary. The network may not be able to handle 50MB blocks, but it can handle blocks larger than 1MB. I'll let the more technical folks figure out where exactly that line is. That means we have an artificial bottleneck on transaction volume--that's not free market. We have artificial scarcity driving up the price. It's like claiming market prices are driving up beach front property when in reality a government regulation makes it illegal to develop on 80% of the available beach front property.
If the block size limit was up against the capacity of the network to transfer data, no rational person would be complaining about fees. *That* would be free market.


I don't really understand this point. First off, miners can just turn off their machines--no one is forcing them to mine. Second, miners make 90% of their profit from the 12.5 BTC reward, not the fees. Why make such a big deal over the fees. Plus, there is no evidence that increased transaction volume decreases total fees. More transactions might equal more fees. Who knows. Even more important than those points, is what I was originally getting at in my post--chasing off users will decrease the value of bitcoin as a whole. Miners would be better off scaling the network, and cashing in on price growth on the 12.5 BTC reward than trying to protect fees in the short term.
@_date: 2017-02-15 18:56:36
Thanks--I'll check it out.
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:17:41
They should want off chain tech. It would increase the user base.
This is what helps miners:
1) lower electricity costs
2) less total hash rate in the space (greater odds of mining a block)
3) *high price of bitcoin*
That is what mining is about. Not fees. Best thing you can do as a miner is grow the pie.
@_date: 2017-02-16 04:31:14
So when a node is validating a transaction, it would need to do the zero knowledge sum and then do the range proof. Supposing everything is okay, it would approve the transaction and relay it to the network. Since any node can see the encrypted inputs and outputs and preform the check, I don't quite see why that has to be *stored*.
Is the verification too computationally intensive to do on the fly (as opposed to doing it once and storing the verification)? Could a Segregated Range Proof be implemented perhaps?
I am very likely misunderstanding some fundamental aspect of this process. You don't have to explain it--I probably need to go do some more reading on this :)
Edit: Okay, I think I am starting to understand. Once a block is mined, you want all the verification right there in the tree. It's not possible to go back and re-verify all the old transactions every time.
@_date: 2017-02-06 20:54:34
If you had to bet, can we expect a consensus within, say the next 12-18 months?
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:13:11


Awesome to hear! If you were a betting man, when would you predict SegWit will be live?
@_date: 2017-02-07 01:16:12


I agree 100%. I didn't mean to come off as making demands. I'm more of a hobbyist than a real stake holder. I'm rooting like hell for bitcoin, but it's not going to really effect me if it becomes a small niche technology. It's like SpaceX and the mars mission. I personally will never go to mars, but its super cool so I hope it happens.
I'm not trying to demand anything, I just want people to realize the reality of the economics, and make a rational choice. Maybe I'm not properly informed, but it seems like miners are being pretty irrational. As a miner, if your paycheck comes in bitcoin, you want to do everything to increase the value of bitcoin. Maybe the devs are being irrational too--I honestly don't know. All I do know is that the price eventually must drop if the network doesn't expand. I imagine most of the devs hold a bunch of bitcoins.

A hard fork is also kicking the can down the road. The great thing about SegWit is you get more for less. You don't have to increase the storage/bandwidth requirements, yet you get more transactions.
SegWit is a no brainer, and then a block size increase will probably be eventually needed at a later time.
In my opinion, you could flip a coin and do SegWit then HF to 2MB, or HF to 2B then SegWit. The bigger danger is the status quo --&gt; maxing out the network prematurely, and strangling growth by artificially limiting transaction volume and driving up fees
Let's end the dick measuring contest and head to the moon!
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:35:27


It seems like bitcoin is currently magic internet money roulette. It remains to be seen whether this thing can go big. That's what speculators are betting on. Bitcoin will always exist and will always have users. The question is will it be small and niche, or will it explode. The market cap is currently ~$16 billion which can't be sustained without proper scaling.


If your house is on fire, you don't wait until the flames get to you before you to do something. There is a reason people started talking about scaling in 2013--we were supposed to get out in front of this. Oops.
@_date: 2017-02-15 21:49:48
Excellent point. Removing the need to tumble coins would presumably free up space for more actual transactions.
Do you know of any quantitative estimates for what percent of transactions are money transfer as opposed to shuffles between a single user's addresses?
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:19:46
Everyone has been expecting scaling. That is priced into $1000/btc. Leaving things as they are caps the transactions/day so no more growth. No more growth --&gt; price drops
At current prices, a miner makes $14,000/block. Say fees double but the exchange rate drops 20%. Now the miner only makes $12,200/block. Miners shouldn't give a shit about the fees until the block reward drops. Right now, miner revenue is predicated on the strength of the currency and the health of the network.
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:33:20
Okay, I agree my comparison is not perfect. I've been thinking of a better apples to apples comparison.
You wouldn't compare PayPal to Coinbase. Coinbase is an exchange, not a money transfer service. If I want to send you $100, my choices are bitcoin, PayPal, Western Union, cash, etc. I can't send you money with Coinbase.
It's weird because bitcoin is a currency *and* and money transfer service. That's one reason its so awesome. Bitcoin is not a centrally controlled company, but it acts like one in the sense it provides a service (money transfer) for a fee (miner fee). It's owned by the users, not shareholders. It's basically a democratically owned, decentralized company.
I'm still working out how to properly compare market cap, revenue, profit, growth, etc between bitcoin and a publicly traded company. The comparison is there--it's just a matter of getting the math right.
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:39:29
Someone gets it! Now, do you know Mandarin?

@_date: 2017-02-07 22:37:12


I'm happy with either or both scaling options. My point is that, ironically, the status quo is a dangerous track. We are all on the same boat here--let's not sink it.
@_date: 2017-02-07 05:47:09
Forget challenges of user adoption, there is too much uncertainty in the fees right now. Does Starbucks charge you a $2 fee to use the app? The average bitcoin transaction is $1,053. If you don't think the big fish will bit up transaction prices to over $10 a pop you have your head in the sand. Do the math.

Honest question: SegWit makes miners lose money?
@_date: 2017-02-07 01:01:20
Let's be honest here. It's bitcoin or nothing (at least in the foreseeable future). Bitcoin is not competing against litecoin or dogecoin, it's competing against cash, wire transfer, and PayPal. Hardly anyone knows about bitcoin let alone Primecoin. Maybe a long time from now some altcoin breaks out, but we are no where close to that right now.
The realistic options are,
1) bitcoin wakes up and realizes the urgent need to scale --&gt; network value increases, and the long term price steadily increases
2) bitcoin doesn't scale and becomes a niche technology with few applications --&gt; price corrects down when people realize a large amount of potential bitcoin tech turns out to be impossible, and the user base shrinks
The fantasy option is that the transaction capacity is never increased, yet the value of the network (and price) magically grows forever. The entire point of my post was to debunk this fantasy future of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:12:29
I figured it was something like that. Thanks for the alternative site.
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:16:28
At present rates, people are paying ~$60 million annually in fees. That is essentially revenue to the network. A worthless commodity does not bring in $60 mil/year. Additionally, the miners are securing the network. Their hardware could be considered "assets." None of bitcoin's assets, revenue, or equity is centrally owned, but in aggregate it still kind of functions like a company.
The flip side, of course, is that the bitcoin market cap is over $16 billion. If that's the "valuation" some percent of that price is based on the utility of the network, but some *has* to be based on speculation. Pardon the lose use of terms, but we basically have a price to earnings ratio of &gt;300. We need to grow for that to make sense.
Bottom line is that bitcoin *does* have real value, as a permissionless, decentralized money transfer platform. Also, it has value as a currency. Even the speculation is not a roulette, it's based on expected future growth of the platform.
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:40:18


6 years ago transaction were nearly free, and confirmed very quickly. We've regressed :(
@_date: 2017-02-07 06:52:16
Maybe I should rephrase. If bitcoin stopped growing tomorrow, what would a fair price be?
For context, PayPal has 188 million users and $9.2 billion in annual revenue. PayPal's market cap is $20.75 billion.
Bitcoin has a couple million users and collects (at present trends) approximately $50 million in fees annually. Ignoring the fact PayPal has many more users and looking fees alone, bitcoin's market cap would be $500 million. That is $31/BTC.
Don't misunderstand, I'm not saying the price should be $31/BTC. $1030 or even $1200 might be a fair price, but ~95% of the value is based on expected growth. If that growth is stalled, expect a price correction.
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:48:10


Like it or not, filling up blocks is experimental. The number of transactions is now capped. In bitcoin's 9 year history, we have never tried this. Let's not get too comfortable with where we are.
I don't support BU, but I do think we need a greater sense of urgency to fix scaling. Maybe better communication with the miners as to why SegWit is good?
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:34:11


There are two things wrong with this thinking. First, off-chain doesn't replace on-chain transactions. Off-chain just grows the total transaction capacity of the network. On-chain will always be preferred, so it's not like everything is suddenly going to move off-chain. Second, right now, miners income is mostly the block reward. Fees amount to barely anything. You don't want to strangle the platform just to increase fees a tiny bit.
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:51:19


You're right we will eventually scale. But don't you think there are risks associated with delay? People have been building around bitcoin *under the assumption of smooth scaling* so it seems problematic to just cut loose those people from the ecosystem.


I really hope the price is right, and I'm wrong. How many of the people bidding up the price realize the degree of gridlock, and the cost of delay?

First off, to clarify I'm not *specifically* advocating for a HF increase or SegWit or anything. My point is that we just can't sit on our hands and expect everything to be fine--people need to think about where the value of bitcoin comes from, and that maybe just maybe the current price reflects expected transaction capacity.
The block limit (thus transaction volume) is fixed, so prices will keep rising. Maybe I'm a cheap fuck for complaining about $0.50 fees but what about $20 fees? What's the limit?
Are we really prepared to price out of the market bitcoin based tech which require small transactions? Even $0.25 is large on a percentage basis for small transactions. This gets to the bottom of my point. $1000/BTC assumes an increasing user base and new innovate tech. You can say we want to cut loose the bottom 30%, but realize a bunch of potential bitcoin tech becomes impossible. You may not want that tech as part of bitcoin, but I think it's needed. Otherwise bitcoin is just pseudonymous wire transfer at $20 a pop which really isn't that valuable.
@_date: 2017-02-13 01:21:57
Gotcha. Since fees are on a per size basis, wouldn't the size issue handle itself? From what I understand, the confidentiality can be toggled on and off, so it would just cost extra, right?
@_date: 2017-02-08 04:01:03


So this is what I'm referring to. I'm not worried about bitcoin long term, but the sooner these companies can jump in, the quicker this thing takes off. The fundamentals are strong, segwit is just taking way too long. Mike Hearn dropped out over a year ago now. Scaling is becoming a persistent issue. Will we be still having this exact discussion a year from now?


Why are we assuming bitcoin is under priced right now? It's not like lack of liquidity is holding the price down. What if a bunch of people just short the ETF? I'm not necessarily predicting that--it's just a possibility to be aware of.
I *know* Apple will be turning huge profits a year from now, but I'm only buying stock if I think it's a good buy. I *know* bitcoin is a really advanced technology and it isn't going away, but I'm not sure if it's a great buy at $1050/btc.
@_date: 2017-02-13 05:04:00
So the entire tx would be something like, the inputs plus 2 encrypted outputs  bytes each? If I'm understanding right, that would be ~5300 bytes instead of the normal 240 bytes. Yeah, that's pretty big.
At current rates that would be ~$5/tx, not to mention clogging up the network. Too bad...

Wouldn't segwit cause the price to rise? Miners' salaries are denominated in BTC, so I see this as a net benefit for them. Seems like a break down of communication to me...
That's the beauty of bitcoin. Everyone can act in their own self interest and the system works smoothly. The problem arises when egos get involved, and people start acting irrationally.
@_date: 2017-02-08 04:15:50
Isn't validation time simply a function of the block frequency (assuming adequate fees, therefore high priority)?
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:17:06
The 12.5 BTC reward is 90% of miner revenue right now. So miners should chase off users (growth) in order to squeeze out a couple extra percent in fees? I don't understand this. Network growth is critical, otherwise the price will drop.
At current prices, a US miner makes $14,000/block. Say fees *double* but the exchange rate drops 20%. Now the miner only makes $12,200/block. Miners shouldn't give a shit about the fees until the block reward drops. Right now, revenue is predicated on the strength of the currency and the health of the network.
This would have been like Facebook plastering adds all over the place right when they were first getting going. Internet 101 is growth first, monetization second. You can't send your product into the shitter just for profit in the next quarter.
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:47:49
The number of bitcoins already mined doesn't matter. Would you rather mine 50 btc back when the value was $30, or 12.5 btc today?
The reward will remain at 12.5 btc until 2021, and will dominate miner revenue over fees. So in the near term price is everything to miners.

I am also a new user. I've found seems more reliable than in almost every case. People have strong opinions, but I have not personally witnessed any censorship. A lot of the devs floating around on here are really knowledgeable.

A- on politeness/helpfulness, 
B+ on openness to new ideas, 
C- on understanding the economics/finance side of bitcoin

The nuclear option is really bad though. First, why would the new miners trust that the goal post wouldn't change again? Fewer miners = less secure network. Second, ASIC is a feature not a bug because it's hard to build up a 51% attack since you would need to buy hardware to do it. Everyone has GPU so the network is at greater risk with a different hash.
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:18:56


This doesn't even make sense. Modestly increasing transaction capacity magically causes censorship? What's the mechanism here?
I'm not downplaying any market. I'm saying let's grab both markets--high dollar and low dollar transactions. That's what bitcoin has always been. Fees have been tiny for the last 8 years with no issue.
If bitcoin grows like crazy and we hit network capacity, I have no problem with rising fees. What I have a problem with is artificial scarcity causing artificially high fees driving away customers just as the platform starts to gain momentum. Eventually off chain transaction can step in and power smaller transactions, but we're not there yet.
Including small transaction (within reason) doesn't really cost the network. If it did, miners would just leave off any transactions that weren't profitable. At this point fees don't fund the miners anyway, the block reward does (at least &gt;90%).

Peter Schiff has some really interesting insight on economic matters. I disagree with him on bitcoin, but that's just one issue. He make sense on a lot of other stuff.
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:03:20
I sympathize with what he is saying. He is not saying bitcoin is dead. Just that the regulators are opposing progress.
Bitcoin in its purest form must be held by the user. I will always hold my own bitcoin. That being said, there are a lot of people who may want to use bitcoin as a store of value without the hassle/risk of securing it (think your parents/grandparents). The ETF gives more people access to bitcoin.
We don't need the ETF--we already have bitcoin. Other people need the ETF. The SEC just blocked that.

You make a good point. Bitcoin is so out of the ordinary that it takes a while for people to get on board. With a piece of software like Snapchat, it is easier to get mass adoption quickly.
The one thing I'd push back against is that we are pushing away users who have decided to give bitcoin a try. If you just say, adoption will be slow for a really novel technology, I'll agree. But we are actually losing merchants, and people are celebrating that because "buying a sandwich on the blockchain is not worth it." It seems like we are ignoring the value of mass use, and trying to make every transaction individually profitable.
Snapchat doesn't give a fuck about spam. They want volume of users regardless of what they are doing with the app. They don't stop a user from sending some pointless pic to save bandwidth. They expand network capacity. The attitude is different with bitcoin. If I want to send a dollar or two, it's too bad for me. We are building out the protocol in such a way as to intentionally exclude a growing number of frowned upon use cases.
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:17:19
Snapchat was created in 2011, so it's grown faster than bitcoin. That's depressing. Sometimes I think we are so busy patting ourselves on the back we don't realize where bitcoin *could* be today.
Snapchat has become valuable doing what every internet company ever tries to do--gain more users and build a *robust network effect*. If bitcoin had a growth mindset, we might well be at $10,000/coin right now.
Bitcoin is a way more novel than Snapchat. It's much more technically advanced. We have smarter devs working on the code. What's holding us back?
@_date: 2017-02-17 14:51:40
This is such an irrelevant stat. The bitcoin price is really strong right now, and we are in a huge bull market. Why pull obscure stats out of your ass? It's more impressive to say we are +6% this week, +21% over the last 30 days, and +153% over the last 12 months. Additionally, bitcoin has averaged +200% *per year* from April 2011 to now.
@_date: 2017-02-08 14:36:47


This is just speculation. Can I get some calculations? Show me that bandwidth/storeage can't handle 2MB blocks.
Adam Back: "2-4-8 is relatively safe" (9 Sep 2015)


This doesn't apply. An increase in price benefits everyone. Miners' profit is entirely based on the current price of bitcoin, not fees (right now, and for the foreseeable future).
At current prices, a miner makes $14,000/block. Say fees double but the exchange rate drops 20%. Now the miner only makes $12,200/block. Miners shouldn't give a shit about the fees until the block reward drops a couple more times (~6 years out). Right now, miner revenue is predicated on the strength of the currency and the health of the network.
You don't start monetizing at the expense of growth this early in a project. That's internet business 101.

Why do you say that? It seems like even if only one of your transactions is hidden, your entire balance will be unknown.
From a privacy standpoint,
X + X - X + X - X + X
is much better than,
2 + 8 - 17 + 1283 - X + 4
But even in the second case your final balance is unknown.

I agree, it's somewhat misleading. I'm bracing for the flood of comments saying that all the head lines are accurate. Sure they are all true, but they don't give an accurate picture of bitcoin.
There is what is explicitly said, and there is what is implied. The implication is that bitcoin user/holders lost a lot of money today. That is false.
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:45:35
It is not in the miners interest to have high fees. The block reward makes up over 90% of their revenue. The best thing for miners is a high price of bitcoin.

In the immortal words of Dr. Alfred Lanning, "That, detective, is the right question"!
I would love to hear if anyone has info on this. I'm hoping that there is lots of negotiation going on behind the scenes. I'm not going to sling mud at either side, because that's just counterproductive. Some compromise needs to be reached before we lose a lot of users.
In a sense, transaction overload is a good problem because it means people are using the platform. That being said, I don't see a compelling reason to limit volume and price people out of the market *until we reach a bandwidth limit*. But we are not at the stage yet. By the time we get there, off chain tech will be ready and can seamlessly take over.
@_date: 2017-03-02 08:02:33


No single entity owns or controls bitcoin, but it's actually really similar to a company. Governance is done by the community, not a board/CEO. That's basically the only difference.
We can go back and forth about the similarity and differences between Snapchat and bitcoin, but that's missing the point. *Price* allows comparison between two totally different things. I can directly compare how much the market values a grapefruit, a hot air balloon ride, and Apple stock based on their relative price. These things have little to no similarity, but that doesn't matter.
The inescapable reality is that the market values a bitcoin less than a piece of ownership in Snapchat which is basically just a simple piece of software. No amount of mental gymnastics gets around this.
To say that bitcoin doesn't need to scale right now because it is doing well is rubbish. It could (and should) be so much more valuable right now.

There exists approximately 33 million troy oz of gold for every bitcoin, so this is not a great comparison.

Total volume is more meaningful. Gold is at ~$8.5 trillion, and bitcoin is just over $20 billion. Bitcoin is really strong right now but we are no where near gold yet.

Rewards only get "small" when denominated in bitcoin. The 50 BTC reward back when bitcoins were $10 each is nothing compared to 12.5 BTC now (~$15,000). If bitcoins are worth $4000 in 2024, the 6.25 BTC reward will be worth $25,000. Rewards are going up not down.
