But these people are not investors with portfolios.
They bought bitcoin to make money without thinking about it as an investment.  It would be a gamble, one they didn't understand because they gambled based on hype, not any real info.
Look at the people who screw up wallet payments and accidentally give away all their btc.  People are not educated on how any of this works and they can throw money in without being educated.

LOL, bitcoin is not libertarian.  
Libertarians are against fiat currencies backed by nothing of real value.

I don't care what you say, Ron Paul is not a joke!

What about the post telling people to buy more bitcoin?  
How is that not a meme, troll, emotional, etc post?

Correct, I wasn't going to go there, but yes, the US currency is backed more than bitcoin since a government backs it.
That is why bitcoin is even less appealing to libertarians than US dollars.

Don't forget the post about how bitcoin can be used to transfer money in and out of china without being traceable.
What did people think was going to happen, that should have been a huge warning flag to get out.

No store is going to honor any bitcoin transaction that costs them money.
Not to mention, they don't even need to refund your bitcoins since there is nothing you can do to force them to return them.

The core of libertarianism is currency that cannot be arbitrarily devalued, so it must be backed by something with real value.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:22:27
No, you know nothing.  Libertarians want a currency backed by something of value.
They don't want a currency based on nothing.  Look, bitcoin lost half of it value simply because of a government action.  That is exactly what libertarians don't want.

Except they adjust their prices against US currency automatically.  So you are really just using bitcoin as a short term giftcard that can lose value between buying the btc and making a purchase on the site.
An xbox bone on there costs ~550 right now.  50 bucks more than retail without tax.
I was talking about stores that fail to update bitcoin prices, they won't be taking a loss.

When it started making news that people in china were using bitcoin to get around chinese law.

No memes or emotional posts!
*posts suicide hotline post to bring suicide into the discussion and mock the people who lost money*

How many of those stores can buy all their product in bitcoin?
Stores will not take losses like this.  I also find it strange any store selling in bitcoin would not automatically adjust prices based on the bitcoin price in US dollars.

Liberty?  Libertarians want people to have property rights above all else and if you are not the consumer of a business wronging you, you have no recourse.
There is very little liberty in libertarianism.

Why do you hate Ron Paul?  The father of libertarianism.

Whats a portfolio?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:03:54
Libertarians do not want currencies backed by nothing.  That is what we have in the USD.

Using the word portfolio in a bitcoin subreddit is hilarious.
