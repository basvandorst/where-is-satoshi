Hong Kong isn't a country either.

The word is "lose"

Plot twist: He sold 10,000 Bitcoin for $500 to buy that car.

Was 2013 the last time we have 5 consecutive green months?
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:50:25
Trump has probably bought Bitcoin and is saying this so that all the Democrats will buy Bitcoin to spite him. Also, the media is probably going to become very pro Bitcoin because of this tweet.
@_date: 2019-07-05 21:17:25
It looks pretty good!
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:05:50
Actually, we are much closer to 8 billion people than 7 billion now
@_date: 2019-07-30 10:06:52
Try to take over the world?
@_date: 2019-07-05 00:13:00
If Bitcoin's price stayed the same, it means that it failed. Bitcoin's limited supply means that it's value will increase due to loss caused by human error.
@_date: 2019-07-30 10:03:49
I think its even more restrictive. Just because someone has $10,000 doesn't mean they are willing to put it all into a volatile investment. There are very few people who can risk that much money.
@_date: 2019-07-30 10:08:30
This is something I haven't heard many talk about. The idea that countries will have Bitcoin reserves in the same way that the have gold reserves.
@_date: 2019-07-16 05:55:39
Half of the questions the reporters asked were about race.
@_date: 2019-07-24 08:06:28
"This is stupid" this is the thought I had when I read about Bitcoin in a newspaper around 2009 or 2010. I could have been a multimillionaire instead of the loser I currently am.
@_date: 2019-07-23 07:42:40
Does anyone know where this picture is originally from? I've seen it for years and I've always wondered.
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:03:42
Doesn't dividing it indefinitely essentially remove the supply limit? It seems like bitcoin has two choices: an ever declining finite supply of bitcoins due to errors or an essentially infinite supply based on sub-satoshi divisions.  
@_date: 2019-03-31 21:02:18
And the price of bitcoin still went up because no one cares anymore.
@_date: 2019-11-11 08:20:28
Textbook BART pattern.
@_date: 2019-11-01 00:46:39
Is this the first Bitcoin ETF anywhere in the world?
@_date: 2019-11-07 09:26:48
Op is not a boomer; op is part of gen x.
@_date: 2019-08-06 12:51:02
And now Bitcoin is down 5%.
@_date: 2019-08-17 05:39:29
Maybe they think they have to buy a whole Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-04 09:33:03
Bitcoin is Russia?

Thanos would kill half of the altcoins.
@_date: 2019-08-22 07:35:16
What about "a where wolf"?
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:12:27
I know, how dare someone ask a question on this sub and try to learn more about Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-10-10 08:18:51
I can't believe that the ETF was denied. That never happened before. /s
@_date: 2019-08-22 07:54:47
Yes, because being pro-Bitcoin but wanting to restrict free speech makes so much sense.
@_date: 2019-10-16 05:26:41
Obama got away with this with almost zero criticism.
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:50:23
I think that there is one thing people are missing about Bitcoin vs the greater economy. Bitcoin's market cycles are very quick compared to others. 
In the past 10 years, the stock market hasn't completed one market cycle, while Bitcoin has completed three. 
Even, if Bitcoin crashes with the rest of the market, it will probably recover much faster and become attractive to investors while the rest of the market is still deep in a recession.
@_date: 2019-10-19 00:00:31
Which is why I am increasingly using DuckDuckgo.
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:17:45
Because people are stupid and think that Bitcoin needs Libra to become legitimate and mainstream.
@_date: 2019-08-17 05:29:59
Is there any chance it could be delayed still? I don't want to get my hopes up.
@_date: 2019-08-22 07:59:26
Or people could just buy and hold.
@_date: 2019-10-17 21:13:44
As Bitcoin becomes more valuable, more Bitcoin will be held in cold storage.
@_date: 2019-08-14 20:47:11
Can I ask a stupid question? How can a long position be liquidated if Bitcoin is not worth zero? Is it because of leverage?
@_date: 2019-10-26 07:49:39
Will you buy 10,000 Bitcoin worth of pizza?

10% of Americans would be roughly 1/2% of the world.

Why do people use electrum? It seems like every week, someone is getting hacked by using it.
@_date: 2019-08-14 02:45:27
1,000,000 by December 31s 2020.
@_date: 2019-10-13 20:47:06
I think its impossible. There is not enough gold in the whole world to back up all of the existing dollars.
@_date: 2019-10-23 05:11:09
For the billionth time in a row.
@_date: 2019-08-05 21:28:10
That is hilariously ironic.
@_date: 2019-08-04 09:47:25
So, according to those graphs, if you own around 1.1 bitcoin or more. you are in the top 2%?
@_date: 2019-10-26 07:48:37
10 quadrillion in an hour.
@_date: 2019-10-17 21:19:07
Not directly, but some people have compared the Crypto market to the Dot com bubble.
@_date: 2019-08-01 22:24:52
Why is this getting downvoted? Being forced to leave trace amounts of Bitcoin on an account forever is a problem considering its limited supply
@_date: 2019-10-26 07:54:09
This is why we hold.
@_date: 2019-10-31 06:10:08
What you don't believe that it is possible? /s
@_date: 2019-08-03 02:52:44
So will I get paid in Bitcoin for viewing ads if I use this browser?
@_date: 2019-06-21 09:23:18
I want to see this. It will be more entertaining to see these two fight than any movie.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:29:47
Pay attention to asteroid mining. That's probably the next big thing comparable to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-21 09:30:21
We are at a different part of the market cycle than 2017. 2017 was the end of the last bull run. 2019 is the beginning of this bull run. The curve will probably become steeper as we progress through the bull market.
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:28:32
It's more than you think. If you were to spread .1 Bitcoin out evenly, only about 3% of the world's population could have that much.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:20:20
In December 2017, we were actually ahead of the curve.

No, he is the prophet.

Warren Buffet will be around 100 in the 2030s. Although,  It's possible he could still be alive and investing

Holding Bitcoin long is often painful, but the market often changes trends when everyone least expects.
@_date: 2019-06-21 09:21:47
This is wrong. Bitcoin isn't a stock. You don't need to cash out Bitcoin to realize profits because you can spend Bitcoin and you will benefit from increased buying power.
@_date: 2019-12-19 09:04:46
I believe he actually raised it to 2 million by 2021.
@_date: 2019-04-02 04:42:14
I saw it too. I thought it was a glitch but it is showing up on multiple exchanges. Does anyone know what is going on?
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:12:55
So Mcafee is right?
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:29:15
We will also get a huge amount  of fomo if we hit $100,000.

What is stopping countries from adopting a dual currency system where Bitcoin is considered money along side their national fiat currency?
@_date: 2019-12-20 01:51:50
I looked it up; he did raise it to two million by 12/2020.

@_date: 2019-12-29 09:20:45
If early adoption of Bitcoin is this advantageous, why haven't any countries done it yet?
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:22:48
Are we sure this is real? I just can't believe it.
@_date: 2019-04-12 01:44:09
It's broken bearish five times in a row. Funny how it never works that way going up.
@_date: 2019-04-10 00:34:20
Why not just give everyone the equivalent amount of usd owed in bitcoin? Why sell them at all?
@_date: 2019-04-10 10:34:58
How many time has China done something like this? We all know that they are just trying to push the price down so that they can buy more in case the market turns bullish.
@_date: 2019-01-10 10:18:21
Why are US investors excluded?
@_date: 2019-09-30 07:41:27
@_date: 2019-09-06 06:06:18
So are you saying that the prophecy is true?
@_date: 2019-09-30 08:45:09
Maybe a miracle will happen and a Bitcoin ETF will be approved this month.
@_date: 2019-09-10 05:56:33
I think the result is referring to "a medium of exchange" aka money.
@_date: 2018-07-27 07:22:42
Yes, lets let China rule the world instead. Never mind the fact that they are the greatest polluters on the planet, suppress the rights of their own citizens (especially in Hong Kong), and are not afraid to use violence to get what they want. Sure America threatens other nations too, but at least they try to justify it. China thinks that they are superior to everyone else and that allows them to take what they want without any apology or explanation. Also, never mind the fact that most of the fud comes from an Asian government cracking down on cryptocurrency or an Asian exchange getting hacked. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 07:57:27
I think it's a sloth.
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:50:27
I just wouldn't want to tempt hackers. I'll admit that I am really paranoid; especially regarding cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:20:16
The U.S. GDP grew by more than 3% last year. I really don't think you can call that a bear market.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:55:36
Too late. I maxed out my credit cards,sold my house, pawned the wedding rings, raided the kid's college funds, and got a loan from every loan shark within 100 miles.
@_date: 2019-05-20 22:47:05
Honestly, I wish they would just give up. All this does is create more FUD. A Bitcoin ETF is not going to be approved.
@_date: 2019-05-20 22:45:06
Panic sell everything. Bitcoin is clearly dead now.
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:28:53
I don't think it is a good idea for you to let everyone know your exact amount of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-09 10:46:50
This is one of the worst bitcoin articles I have ever read.
@_date: 2019-05-11 11:38:47
My guess would be Disbelief or Hope.
