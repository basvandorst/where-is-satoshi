I think this video is misleading, and you do not catch what it means, there is a playlist, you may go through it.
The product is a hardware wallet, with both BIP39 standard seed and this "strengthing" seed to protect the plaintext  mnemonic. If you to through coins lost cases on the internet, more than half is caused by mnemonic leakage or lost. Mnemonic is the weak point of coin security in fact:
\- single mnemonic paper copy may lost or damage and one will find out this bad things only when he/she need the mnemonic to recovery the seed, everything is to late.
\- multiple mnemonic copy or digital copy may lead to leakage.
The conflicting point on mnemonic is hard to handle even for a technology guys. with superseed, the mnemonic is immune to passphrase collision, multiple mnemonic copies are safe and available for recovery at anytime.

It's a product, a hardware wallet with security chip, OLED and numpad key pad for inputting. Please vist the official site [

It's a hardware wallet, the seed stored in the hardware wallet and will not leave the hardware wallet. The internet connected App is only a observe wallet, and has  little influence on the security.

Both the mnemonic and the passphrase input on the hardware wallet, much much more secure than internet connected PC or mobile phone.
