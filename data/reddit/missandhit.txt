Hardly. By far the majority of people buying are traders looking to make a quick profit.

So OP, why don't you just tell us how this is relevant to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-27 21:43:51
Wait. Don't tell me you seriously think he is gonna suggest moving to Bitcoin or something even close to that. 
I realize a lot of people here completely lost touch with reality but that would take you a level higher even.

None of this would matter if there were tons of people interested in Bitcoin who want to buy coins. Which there aren't. This is the real problem. 
Can the downvoters tell me where i'm wrong?

I don't feel sorry for people losing their money in these scams. Ponzies are as old as Rome and very recognizable. It's made for extremely greedy people.

Can you really still not see this is just traders doing their daily pump and dump? 
We had the same blah blah yesterday when we went to 300 only to drop again to 250. Everyone went nuts and we're talking about insane prices again. This was 100% traders doing their thing and taking profits from naive Redditors who thought we went to the moon. Today isn't any different. 
While everyone here thinks Coinbase will take us to the moon the whales took advantage of this delusion and pumped the price and dumped on the small fish when they followed. 
And they will do it again.

Miners stop mining because the price is too low. 
But of course in this sub a low price that just won't go up anymore is considered good news. Because bad news doesn't exist here. 
But in reality those journalists are right and you are fully aware of it.

How is it possible there are STILL people who fall for this scam? Are 1000's of warnings really not enough. 
I'm not even gonna warn people anymore. I'm just gonna say go ahead and buy it. At some point people just need to learn it the hard way. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 14:52:09
Yes. Very possible.

It doesn't make sense to send out Bitcoin spam to random mail lists because probably .001 people on his list own coins. Random lists have millions of address and take hours to mail. Which would be a waste of time. So he very likely has targeted lists. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 12:02:37
Bitcoin what?
@_date: 2015-01-27 21:16:07
This is already posted and it has nothing to do with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 23:29:43
How do you people get targeted all the time? I never get any of these mails because obviously a random spammer doesn't know i own coins. How do they find emails attached to Bitcoin owners?
