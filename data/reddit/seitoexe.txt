Glad you caught that! This is just a quick sketch to play around with shape/colours.

Will make this variation for sure

Thanks, that's a big compliment. This was born from the need to have less corney shirts.

Noted, I'll keep this one a variation! You fancy it as 'BTFD' or just fully written?
@_date: 2019-10-06 10:08:00
Holds truth for some of us too haha, dual use

Yeah I'm sketching around a bit with it, would you personally mind such a logo being on it?
@_date: 2019-10-06 10:09:49
1. Thanks so much!
2. I had to double check as well
@_date: 2019-10-06 10:07:41
Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2019-10-04 20:40:30
Solid. Noted!

Aaah good one, didn't think of that myself but it sounds so obvious
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:53:48
Yeah it would turn into 'buy the dip' in that case, BTD sounds whack. I agree about it being bad advice to noobs, but 'buying the dip' has that kinda early btc vibe to it
@_date: 2019-10-04 16:39:07
What if it would've just said 'Buy the dip' or 'BTD' ?
@_date: 2019-10-04 20:07:03
Glad you like it, when I have the final version I'll post the link here or share it with you! Going to adjust the design based on the feedback I get here
@_date: 2019-10-06 10:10:35
Contemplating about designing more, but the .shop domain sounds pretty good
@_date: 2019-10-04 19:59:05
That was the initial plan, but that nice candle green looks really bland in CMYK unfortunately
