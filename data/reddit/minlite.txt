Except that what they did was totally legal

This. He asked people who have worked with him since 2013 to contact him. Probably they got into a convo and one asked for a verification. He tweeted the hash out to validate and then deleted it.

Now only if they could fix their fee calculation

Honestly I don't think the alts are pumped. The reason we see a huge  rise in ethereum and litecoin price is that people who are just getting in feel they can make more profit by buying coins that cost less, although it doesn't really matter when you look at percentages. Every newbie I've talked to has asked me if its better ltc or eth instead.

The winner is on 5k now. Still going strong.

You fell for a copypasta..

You're going to the extremes. Of course, opposing execution of innocent individuals is not fascism, as it's a direct call to violence. Even 1A doesn't protect that... But these "people" are opposing non-violent ideas that are protected by 1A. 
As you yourself said:


@_date: 2017-02-02 19:19:44
Violence and threats intended to silence people with opposing view points is fascism though...

So Shift but less advanced?

Well the attack was done by Antifas. Several of my friends who go to Berkeley confirmed that they were the ones who turned the protests violent. I'm not sure if you're familiar with them, but think of Antifas as anti-fascist skinheads. They don't seem to realize they are fighting fascism by being fascists.

I don't need to. I have nothing against a software that does exactly what it promises

This. I can't wait for my Trezor to get here so I can take my 40btc out of Coinbase. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 19:28:35
Internet also allowed the hack to happen. If there wasn't internet, the hack wouldn't happen. Let's just all sue the Internet, shall we? 
Idiot.

I had about 50 in Coinbase for a while... Yes, I was dumb...
@_date: 2017-08-26 07:22:43
Cool, thanks. I just found out I had about $52 in changetip!

I know.. I bet 1 BTC on him (at 2x return) so I won about $1500. It was a really bizarre feeling. I was sitting in the lobby of a building at my college in the middle of LA watching the results on my laptop and feeling happy about my win, but at the same time I saw all these people running up and down the stairs and heard them murmuring about the results..

You mean Nate Copper? He lost value after the election...
@_date: 2015-07-29 09:02:30
Guess it's just a stunt
@_date: 2016-02-20 21:16:51
I have about 40 btc there. This is tempting me to finally pull the trigger on a hardware wallet...
@_date: 2016-02-21 21:51:10
It probably is... I have been always afraid of loosing my hardware wallet. That's why I've not invested in one yet, but I guess the risk of getting them stolen far outweighs the risks of loosing the wallet. 
The 40 I've accumulated in 2 years. Some of them are $178/btc coins, but most are 245$/btc. Im waiting for the halving to see what will happen with the prices

I have never tried it, but you can probably set up your Trezor offline, on a freshly set up virtual machine if you're concerned about the security. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:36:17
The data is actually decrypted after the user pays up. That's the reason people keep paying.

Been hodling since it was $200 a pop

Don't forget, the police can force you to unlock your phone if it has fingerprint, but they can't if it has passcode.

Irony is having limits on your moving your own money (I know, no private key = no coins)

Someone who steals new cars (unaware of the fact that they all have tracking built in) isn't probably smart enough to know or care about Bitcoin. 
Now, you could get followed or hurt by people who realize what it is. I wouldn't deny that.

Doesn't need to. CIA has their malware and does their job for them.
