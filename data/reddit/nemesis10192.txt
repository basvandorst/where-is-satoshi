I'm totally guilty of the same, as you say running the calculations of how much just a few extra thousand right now could compound into in the future makes it ridiculously hard for me to not want to go all into crypto besides what I absolutely need to survive.
That said I'm in the lucky position to be young, without a family and with some high income skills and some potentially very good things coming my way in the near future, so even if all my money in crypto went poof (which is basically all my money haha), I would almost certainly be more than okay. But that doesn't stop it hurting like mad watching thousands flow out of my portfolio in the blink of an eye, even if I think its still the right long term choice!

There's so much truth to this it actually hurts haha.
And I  would say you have a good strategy for yourself there if its messing with you so badly.
Personally I'm not gonna cash anything out at this point, but I'm gonna stop putting anything more in, build up my fiat reserves a little. Then in a few months if its all going up I'm already winning and putting more in is far less risky, and if its going down, well I'll still have some stable cash to make me far less emotionally dependant on my crypto assets, and then I'll have the potential to buy more coins at a lower price if/when it looks to be reversing, and if I feel like upping my risk to the whole thing again.

And thats the price to pay as someone whos not all that wealthy who has a significant ammount invested in this game.
The upside is it could change your life in the way nothing else could with such certainty in a few years, the downside is dips (even relatively "small" corrections of 20-30% are terrifying punches to the gut, even if you still believe in the long term success of cryptocurrencies.
(I'm in the same boat)
