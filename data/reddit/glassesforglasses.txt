Binance or bittrex

A 540 would really get your point across, 900 would be overkill. 540 is the sweet spot

I think it’s smart to diversify.  I think crypto is the real deal and there are some others that specialize in certain areas that I think are valuable

I don't get why everyone is freaking out (I mean i do but we've seen this so often).  Sell if you want but it's going to rise back up like it has every single time. It'll just make it cheaper for some of us to increase our stash. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:02:18
Just chill out. It’ll get there!
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:34:54
Good luck my friend.  I hope you cash out at the highest and get back in at the lowest
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:10:29
Yep, I'm sure people sold below 9k just 15 mins ago and now are regretting that. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:40:03
Nah probably just some sell orders hitting 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:28:41
I can get on board with that.  I guess doing nothing has brought me here, might as well ride it out.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:39:33
The timing is the tricky part.  Another glass of rum and theres no such thing as bad timing.  You got this! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:52:57
I can’t agree more. My analysis is telling it’s going to definitely last 2

I drink too much coffee to day trade this stuff, my heart wouldn't be able to handle it.  I don't know how some people do it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:32:43
Yeah, watching this all play out has been pretty fucking wild.

Gemini is super simple.  Once you get your Trezor set up you'll be given a wallet address to receive bitcoin.  You'd just have to login to Gemini, go to transfer funds, withdraw from exchange, BTC, then paste your BTC wallet address from your Trezor into the empty box.  I would double check it and send a small amount first just to make sure everything goes smoothly.

I bought a hardware wallet because I felt a lot more comfortable being in control of my coins.  You only have $500 invested currently but if you are planning on investing more I would probably get one.  Chances are you won't regret it if you get one.

Damn, I wish I didn't like this restaurant so much
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:04:19
Oh fuck yeah.... this would be great. Hope it comes to fruition

It was pretty easy I just did a lot of nothing. I'm still fairly new to the crypto game (about 5 months since I made my first investment). But looking at where bitcoin was and where it is now we're looking pretty damn good. I don't plan on trying to short the market only increase my standing during these dips. If I panicked already then I probably had no business investing in the first place. I believe in bitcoin so I'm in it for the long haul, can't let 1 bad week scare me away. Just my opinion on the matter. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:06:58
Hopefully you're at least getting fodnlded...
I'll see myself out

There's a lot of people in this sub smarter than I so someone can correct me if I'm wrong.  You buy on an exchange and once that bitcoin balance in fully cleared and deposited into your exchange wallet you can then transfer it to your hardware wallet.  As far as I know there is no way to buy directly through your hardware wallet.
