@_date: 2018-01-13 04:44:32
Thank you good sir
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:12:55
Still don't get it. Will I have to set up a new channel with each store or bar I wanna transact with?
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:21:47
how can i see this in tradingview?
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:27:02

Hmmm I don’t believe that

What if I told you Becky's boyfriend's Sister's cousin is Satoshi Nakamoto...
Edit: Sorry, it's actually Kevin Bacon
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:14:59
if I may ask: what's this mean bro?
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:21:26
can you give us an update? is the black line still above the red one?
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:48:10
not true in case of bitcoin atm's no?
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:39:33
so, in other words... "HODL" ?
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:47:04
my thinking as well, why the down votes?
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:28:15
forgot: it's 2017... can't use *hot* to describe the ladies anymore
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:16:02
where does he say *bitcoin* is his legacy? maybe he means his bitcoin**s**. wouldn't be surprised if it's 100mil+ by now :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:46:40

Fuckin love Andreas.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:27:31
but but but bcash tx's really are faster and cheaper at this moment...
until that's fixed in btc, I'm giving Ver the benefit of the doubt.

Yeah I keep telling myself another gox situation probably won't happen again, but who knows...
If gox happened again at say coinbase, that would be the end of bitcoin, no?
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:24:42
Which wise man was this?
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:46:17
Reason I ask is, isn't it so that for example coinbase-to-coinbase transactions are way faster than coinbase-to-other-wallets?
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:33:31
the wheel's on the wrong side though
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:25:17

Now that tx fees are pretty high and everyone seems to be willing to pay them, will miners even accept updates to bitcoin that will generate less revenue for them?
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:59:01
srsly considering taking all my money out, getting a little scared
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:33:33
Related question: When will the receiver see the transaction in his wallet? After 1 confirmation? Or possibly before?
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:52:24
Cryopreserved, probably.

Anyone know what happened to mempool transactions between 17:00 and 18:30?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:36:07
Sorry to be the 100th person to say this but, this kinda volatility really sucks for people who are trying to *use* bitcoin. Paid way too much for something ordered *3 weeks ago* :)  Let's hope futures will temper this down.
Happy though, a little sad.

@_date: 2017-12-15 13:45:11
not a bcash fan, but forking bitcoin if you honestly believe you can improve it is perfectly ok in my book. "copyright infringements" are words that shouldn't be used in this community.

@_date: 2017-12-21 13:11:38
rottenapples4u, your wrong and dgfdfdfdf is correct. Most people do care about high tx fees. Quintall1 is also correct. People should write their wallets and exchanges to implement segwit.

Was aware of LN and bcashjesus's asshatness :)
Just wondering why this screenshot is funny. He surely should have at least a few bcashApostles that should be interested to test LN, no?

Don't use Skinner as "bitcoin" and Bart as "financial institutions", that's just wrong...

I trust Floyd Mayweather, this guy knows so much about money it's his middle name, and he's into bitcoin: 
@_date: 2018-02-13 11:34:51
It's a little clunky, but otherwise, the only iOS wallet that supports SegWit. Works for what I need it for. I put *usable* in quotes because it's... uhm... "usable".
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:07:28
my momma tells me to sell though :)

In Europe we're seeing 2K numbers right now
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:31:39
This is good. This news will weed out the weak ass pussies.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:03:21
Noob question: Is it possible that I, living in Europe, am not paying any transaction fees? When I send 5 euros to a friend, my bank account gets deducted by 5 and my friend receives 5 complete euros.

I won't stay dead forever, I'm having my brain frozen to wake back up in the year 3000 when cyborg bodies are available for 0.1 BTC.

Bitcoin’s association with crime and black markets is a huge mark FOR it.

Don't they just count the wallets that haven't transacted since whenever?
Hodlers move their coins from one wallet to another from time to time for whatever reason, or buy more to hodl.
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:02:39
Calling a joke stupid doesn't mean he's upset about it :)

"nice! What can I get for 0.1 BTC?"
Nothing! You must hand over your coins to the GoogApple Government immediately or face deletion of your mind file!
