Website is back online now.
@_date: 2019-07-10 16:51:14
That's a really interesting idea, thank you!

We’re doing a pre-launch campaign, because in order to make this model viable we need to have x amount of users.  As soon as we hit our target, there will be no referral campaigns, we can launch our product with the focus on education and seamless distribution of Bitcoin at scale.  Zero cost of entry and no exchanges.
@_date: 2019-07-11 10:22:25
Not for altcoins, for live blockchain products. Gaming companies, etc.
@_date: 2019-07-11 10:59:40
Not at all, we've just had a massive load on the website and we're working on fixing it. Please bear with us.   
Also you can verify the team on LinkedIn to see it's not a scam.
@_date: 2019-07-11 12:06:12
Yeah, we've taken the site down entirely now to fix the issue. I will update you when it's up again!   
In the meantime, we've also got some blog posts on tokenomics, our concept etc. if you'd like to rake a look -  [
@_date: 2019-07-11 18:49:21
That's exactly what we'll be doing.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:54:08
Where are people doing such large value transactions?
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:34:53
Not all! I'm a noob and once you commit to hodl, you've just got to relax and enjoy the ride. (And hope for the best!) 
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:55:53
Winning! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:23:02
Ah, you're all good then! I started off with a £325 limit when I wanted to invest thousands before the huge growth. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:34:59
Investing what you're willing to lose helps. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:48:25
I'd even get in on a dip back to $6k at this point! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:14:21
Juicy assets
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:48:29
Surely S2X will be unsuccessful then, it won't actually get them anywhere.
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:42:42
Yeeeeeessssssssssss bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:12:05
Coinbase have pretty low limits on new investors, sometimes as low as a couple hundred quid so if you're really new, I'd get on it quick! 
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:32:53
Huge!

I'm sorry to hear that. Wishing you and your family the best.
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:45:56
Most people I know still don't know, or they've just heard the word Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:45:10
I wish someone had talked to me about Bitcoin earlier so I wouldn't be so late to the party! (Happy to be here now though).
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:35:08
You can buy plenty more tea with these earnings! 
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:18:15
Let's aim for the sun then! 
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:08:47
Why would you though? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:03:51
I had the same issues. My passport didn't match the country I live in and my license had expired and couldn't be renewed until I went to my home country (eye roll). I'm sure there are many reasons though. Email customer service - they responded to me only hours later! 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:38:14
Yeah, the learning is - now is always the time. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:53:06
I'm wanting to buy, but I have to wait for my cap on the exchange to lower. Checking so much as it goes up without being invested as much as I could be. It's excruciating! 
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:30:54
Sorry - noob here! Who are the criminals? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:34:25
Good tip! Do GDAX have higher limits than Coinbase for newcomers? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:30:30
Just hovering under!
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:34:26
Right now it seems so high to buy
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:10:03
Governments will get on board. They can't afford not to. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:23:21
I only lasted a few episodes... May have to give it another shot. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:06:21
I'd be happy with that!

Definitely gone down in history.
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:05:56
I'm interested too.
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:11:19
It's a beautiful day to buy.
