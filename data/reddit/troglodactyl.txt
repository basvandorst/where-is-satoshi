I'd say on any system in which someone else holds the private keys to your funds, which applies to most exchanges.

"Unregulated" isn't the problem there.
@_date: 2015-01-22 04:46:09
How is this like BitShares?  It looks like they're just asking for donations and donation pledges.  Are they actually building something that aligns the contribution incentive with the benefits of success?
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:29:05
BitShares and BitReserve are completely unrelated.
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:56:16
Yeah, that's fair.
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:23:51
Also, regulated exchanges are not good places to hold anything of value.

Bitcoin is still small, but it's already big enough that expecting full consensus on any change is unrealistic.  Unless Bitcoin gets a whole lot more centralized, we're going to need a better way to make decisions as a network, because at some point the decision may be between adaptation and irrelevance.
@_date: 2015-08-09 19:08:59
Malicious how?  Did it send their private keys to its creator and set up remote admin, or by malicious do you mean that it adapted the protocol?
@_date: 2015-08-07 03:42:44
Mining censorship isn't a problem with blockchains in general, it's only a problem with ones that have effectively become centralized.
@_date: 2015-08-09 20:53:54
This is true.  But that's a horribly inefficient and destructive system for deciding what direction the network should take.  It's all Bitcoin has at the moment though, so that's what has to be used until enough individuals decide to run something that includes a better consensus system.
@_date: 2015-08-06 05:19:06
Sort of.  He went in a big circle and made the point that competition limits profit, which has very little to do with how much value the system creates and at what total cost.
@_date: 2015-08-09 20:47:14
And yet Bitcoin has no system for generating or measuring real consensus before the fork, so what do you expect them to do?  The only way to adapt is to throw something out there and see if people will adopt it.
@_date: 2015-08-06 05:12:35
I agree that block producers will compete by expending up to the value of the block reward in order to obtain the block reward, but the efficiency of that process depends on the value of each block to the network, and the block reward offered.  At some high value of block reward as a percentage of current supply, Bitcoin would become unsustainable because the cost of each block would exceed its value to the users, and at some low value of block reward, Bitcoin would become unsustainable because the cost of producing a block exceeds the incentive.  Transaction fees are one available control to regulate block rewards, but most of the externalities can't be properly incentivized through that alone.
The most economically efficient blockchain will be the one that produces the greatest utility (in the form of functionality and trustlessness) at the lowest maintenance cost.  The entire point of offering a block reward paid by the network is to entice block producers to "waste" their efforts in ways that produce as much value to the network members as possible.  If you don't make the case that PoW is actually irreplaceable for security purposes and other externalities, then you might as well argue that surgeons should do their work wearing mittens, since they'd still be willing to put in 1 BTC worth of effort for 1 BTC in pay.
@_date: 2015-08-09 18:20:59
...Which is kind of the point of cryptocurrency.  It's supposed to be neutral and immune from such attacks.
@_date: 2015-08-06 21:09:11
I understand the decentralization premium, but it's possible to design a system that purchases decentralization more or less efficiently than another system does.  It's also possible to purchase more decentralization than provides any benefit at any price.
@_date: 2015-08-06 15:09:53
The key issue here I think is that the "cost" to the miner/staker is all lumped into "waste" and treated as an externality.  In reality the cost includes transaction processing, providing security, issuing tokens (hopefully in a way that expands the network effect and increases network value), and any additional work that actually is wasted to compete for the block reward after all of the work the network needs done is completed.
If you can process transactions, provide security, and grow the network all with a lower block reward, you have a more efficient network.  Would you agree with that statement?
This article ignores that point by comparing the efficiency of PoW and PoS when block rewards are equal, but setting rewards equally while using a more efficient system just wastes everything gained by efficiency.
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:35:27
Yes, but that's the cost to the miner/staker of obtaining the block reward.  What's actually relevant is the cost to the network of obtaining the next block, and the actual value of that block to the network.
You could create a network with a supply doubling every block, such that the block reward was always 50% of the market cap (assuming unconstrained liquidity...).  You could make it either PoW or PoS, and either way people would spend up to 50% of the market cap every block to get the block reward.  This would be less efficient than Bitcoin, because the cost to the network of each block would perpetually exceed the value of each block to the network.  The idea of PoS is to be more efficient than Bitcoin by decreasing the cost to the network of each block by finding cheaper ways of providing security than mining.  If you combine more efficient processes with more intelligent block reward targeting to avoid waste, you will end up with a more efficient network.  The question is whether PoS can actually be secure, and if Bitcoin is already perfectly optimal or if there's room for efficiency improvements.  This article doesn't really touch those points.
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:25:25
Governance systems should acknowledge the reality that anyone can start a node running different rules at any time and fork the network by recruiting to their rule set.  If the fork is controversial then this is a highly destructive process, so what's needed are ways to preemptively verify the degree of support in a verifiable manner before disturbing the network with an actual fork attempt.
The two most relevant metrics are stake weighted support from holders of Bitcoin, and hashpower weighted support from miners.  Unfortunately pools make determining real miner support difficult, unless the pools themselves support polling internally and express the results in their blocks.
@_date: 2015-07-25 23:01:21
That in no way conflicts with what I said.  Their net Bitcoin gain is limited to what other people choose to send them.  And of course they can set the initial token distribution in their new system however they want.  That's true whether they crowdfund development or not, and either contributing to fund development or burning money to get in on the initial distribution is foolish if you don't trust the developers to deliver on the project.  Burning doesn't really make it more trustless, it just makes it more wasteful and less likely that they'll have the necessary resources to succeed.  Sure it reduces the motive for scamming, but if the devs don't even have enough reputation to trust them with some money, why would you trust them to faithfully build you software without being paid anything for it?  The risk to you is the same.
@_date: 2015-08-14 13:04:21
The real risk of fee increases is longterm, when the block subsidies decrease and mining has to be funded primarily by transaction fees rather than by new coins entering circulation.
@_date: 2015-08-06 21:12:17
So a dollar worth of anything is just as expensive as a dollar worth of Proof of Work, therefore Proof of Work is as affordable as anything else?  O.o
@_date: 2015-07-24 08:26:31
The block size isn't the most major issue here, though it certainly makes the problem more obvious.  The major issue is that currently Bitcoin has no way of motivating people to make it decentralized.  The only incentives go toward buying more hash power.  You're right that some level of decentralization is essential to Bitcoin being worthwhile, but currently the Bitcoin network is entirely dependent on unpaid volunteers for decentralization.  Discussing what the ideal cost effective level of decentralization actually is would be more relevant if there were a plan to actually buy it.
@_date: 2015-08-09 18:51:06
So because Bitcoin doesn't have a sufficiently effective consensus system, there can be no public discussion of things that are outside the currently established consensus?  If Bitcoin's survival is dependent on a delicate flower of consensus that must be protected using censorship, then that's a high priority issue that needs to be fixed.  To adapt effectively (or to reject adaptation effectively), the network needs to support discussion and generation of consensus.
@_date: 2015-07-25 16:05:33
Decentralization enables trustlessness by having the same work done by multiple nodes so that no one has to trust a single node, but only has to trust that the nodes are not in collusion.  Running thousands of nodes to process transactions is thousands of times more expensive than running a single node.  In terms of that expense, centralized solutions are more efficient than decentralized solutions, but to obtain that efficiency they sacrifice trustlessness.  The problem I'm pointing out is that Bitcoin does nothing to manage the decentralization of transaction processing, it only manages mining.  Mining has no counterpart in centralized solutions, so trying to say that decentralizing the mining solves the trust issue with centralized payment systems doesn't make sense.  What needs to be decentralized is the actual transaction processing; mining is just an additional expense introduced by Bitcoin's security model.
@_date: 2015-07-24 05:21:34
In order to uphold that promise at scale, Bitcoin needs a method of intelligently balancing the cost of running many redundant nodes against the trustlessness of decentralization across many nodes.  Currently, the miners centralize into a few pools so Bitcoin users pay for lots of redundancy without actually getting that much decentralization.
@_date: 2015-07-26 00:42:26
Certainly their are a lot of scams, and I'm not trying to defend them, but the fact that developers raise money doesn't guarantee that it's a scam.  There's nothing wrong with raising money to build a network and giving the initial token distribution to the people who made it possible.  It's certainly difficult to design and build a competitive network, so it's high risk, but that doesn't mean it's a scam.
@_date: 2015-07-25 20:49:49
Only because many cryptocurrency people have very strange ideas about fundraising.  Imagine if a Kickstarter project burnt all their funders contributions and then struggled to complete the project without funding, or if a brick and mortar startup burnt their investors money but distributed their stock based on how much each investor gave them to burn.  For any project that's actually trying to accomplish something, their are more productive uses of funding than destroying that funding.
If you wouldn't trust a particular developer to build the system you're paying them in startup funding to build, why would you trust the same person to build it for free because you senselessly destroyed your savings?
@_date: 2015-08-09 19:05:19
If Bitcoin forks, it's ambiguous and subjective which branch is "Bitcoin" and which branch is "an altcoin".
@_date: 2015-07-26 14:05:54
I think you're missing the point here.  For an ICO to work, you have to trust the developers with the startup funds, and you also have to trust them to set the genesis state of the new tokens honestly.  If you're willing to trust them with all that, it works fine.  The risk is that you lose the money you send them and don't get a stake in the new system.
Now compare that to burning to initialize a genesis state.  The risk is that you lose the money you burn and don't get a stake in the new system.  The only time the burning option is preferable is when you trust the developers to altruistically build a successful system with no funding and keep their promise to distribute initial tokens to everyone who burned funds, but you can't trust those same developers with any money, and you can't trust them to do the same work if they're actually getting paid for it.
@_date: 2015-07-25 21:47:18
They can't pay themselves an arbitrary amount of bitcoins.  They can pay themselves as much as people are willing to voluntarily send them.  Is giving early investors equity in a startup company inherently a scam?
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:49:58


Sort of.  It's true that being trustless requires redundancy which can be considered inefficient, but there's no necessary inverse correlation between efficiency and trustlessness in Bitcoin's design.  If some company acquired a mining monopoly, Bitcoin would no longer be trustless, but it would still be just as inefficient from the user's perspective since the rewards are predetermined.
I still see Bitcoin as a brilliant prototype, but as a prototype the balance between efficiency and trustlessness is rather haphazard.  More decentralization and redundancy always costs more, so finding the most cost effective level of decentralization is important for a sustainable network.
@_date: 2015-07-25 21:09:44
Bitcoin is already competitive as a dollar and Visa alternative for certain niche purposes, but it will be a struggle to compete with them across the board.
I'm optimistic about decentralized cryptocurrency, but I don't think that Bitcoin is well served by the unchecked optimism of its supporters.  There are still real flaws, and I think if supporters refuse to acknowledge and resolve those flaws, some other cryptocurrency will likely overtake Bitcoin before it reaches global mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2015-08-06 22:08:05
Exactly.  Well put.  The issue with Bitcoin at the moment is that the decentralization premium is rather arbitrary, and the efficiency of the decentralization approach is also in question.  The block reward itself doesn't reward decentralized hashing any more than it rewards centralized hashing, so economies of scale tend to increase centralization.  There isn't really a way of coming to consensus on how much decentralization is enough decentralization for Bitcoin, and if there was a consensus there wouldn't be a clear path to making it a reality.

If those who would coerce the voters have the physical power to overcome the voters, they can be expected to use that power equally to ignore an election as to manipulate that election.  Ultimately democracy has always depended on the ability and willingness of the majority to defend themselves and enforce their decisions.
@_date: 2015-07-25 21:27:23
If you look at it that way it's a prepaid expense, but still an expense.  In order to survive, the Bitcoin network needs to continue hiring miners and transaction processors.  The funding available to pay for this work is the total 21M BTC, plus the recirculation of transaction fees.  I don't really care whether you say that all 21M was 'spent' when it was originally allocated by definition of the protocol to pay for mining or if you say that it's spent gradually as the blocks are created and their rewards are made liquid.  Either way, the network is only economically sustainable if the perceived value created by its utility exceeds the cost for which miners can be found willing to keep it alive.
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:45:28
Bitcoin is trusted by a small niche community, not necessarily by the general population.  It's also the first large network of its type, and has been very resistant to upgrades, so it's pretty reasonable to investigate more efficient systems.  A lot has been learned from Bitcoin, and Bitcoin as a network hasn't learned much of it.
@_date: 2015-07-25 14:59:56
Which is why Bitcoin is constantly on the edge of what is considered "too centralized".  The check on centralization is panic, which is not conducive to healthy growth.
@_date: 2015-07-24 05:28:54
That's not a fundamental limitation of blockchains.  It's a limitation of users having no way to control how much decentralization they're willing to pay for.  More redundancy really does cost more, and there are limits on how much is cost effective.
@_date: 2015-07-25 14:04:49
If this were true, it would be the reason that only the US Dollar (or its fork) could succeed.  Network effect can obviously be overcome, and is overcome every single time a new innovative solution replaces an older and less efficient one.
@_date: 2015-07-25 20:05:57


This is true, but bitcoins that have been mined are much more likely to be in circulation than bitcoins that have not yet been mined, since unmined bitcoins can't be circulated by anyone.
@_date: 2015-07-25 20:30:22
This argument depends on 100% of newly mined bitcoins being put into long term storage by the miners.  Miners have electric bills and other expenses, and I think it's safe to say that many of them do sell.  
The more interesting question to me is why it's so important to you that mining not be considered an expense.
@_date: 2015-07-25 16:27:11
If they weren't minted at all the supply of Bitcoin would decrease, increasing the value of existing units.  You can view miner subsidies either as supply inflation or as having an opportunity cost of supply deflation.  That's not really the point I'm trying to make, but either way it's a real expense, and the value to pay for it comes from the holders of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-24 05:32:10

Follow My Vote?  
@_date: 2015-07-24 07:02:22
That is the question, and currently it's being answered by the miners, who pool together as much as possible until the centralization panic threatens their profits.
@_date: 2015-07-25 20:39:51
Exactly.  All labor and/or burning proves is that the result was worth the sacrifice to someone at some time in the past.  That's no reason why its value should be treated as related to the value of that sacrifice by anyone else at any time after that.
@_date: 2015-08-09 21:50:28
Of course there is.  But having discussions about it on the internet is not an effective or objective way of distinguishing between the two.  Who is deciding which people are clueful, and who is verifying the tally of their opinions to find the majority?  ...And who said the Bitcoin protocol should ultimately be controlled democratically by that group?
@_date: 2015-07-24 19:07:36
I think it's reckless to acknowledge that the incentive structure is so inherently flawed but try to keep rolling along without fixing it.  I'm much less into Bitcoin than I used to be because I started seeing the flaws, and that no one was very serious about truly fixing them.
@_date: 2015-07-24 06:42:40
...And will Bitcoin change so that decentralization can actually be bought, or will it continue to siphon all available resources into more hashpower pointed at the same pools?
@_date: 2015-07-25 23:44:28
Agreed, but I've never been anywhere yet where I could safely expect that any shop I walked into would accept Bitcoin natively.  We may get there eventually, but we aren't there yet.  I'm getting a lot of Bitcoin enthusiasm from you, which is great, but it seems like you think the only problem with Bitcoin is that it hasn't yet reached market saturation yet, and I don't think that's true.  I think Bitcoin already has a lot going for it, but there are legitimate reasons a lot of people are still skeptical.  It's not perfect, and there's room for improvement.
@_date: 2015-08-07 03:31:45
Buying votes is the whole point of campaigning.  That's how the system works.  If you want the result of the election to reflect the will of the people, then that includes letting them sell it to the highest bidder.

The point is that all of the focus is on hashrate.  There's no way to compensate for the expense of transaction processing decentralization.
@_date: 2015-07-24 06:37:49
This.  Trying to keep Bitcoin insignificant enough that no one cares that the incentive structures are broken is not the answer.  It also seems very unlikely that such an approach would lead to widespread parasitic inclusion in consumer electronics.
@_date: 2015-07-24 06:32:34
I'm not at all convinced that growth of bandwidth and processing will out pace growth of transaction volume to that extent, and there's still no incentive for running nodes.  It's a private cost for a public benefit.  Are you basing that on the idea that running a full node will be so trivially inexpensive that most miners will do it anyway?
@_date: 2015-07-25 15:33:55
Mining centralization and transaction processing centralization are two separate things.  Bitcoin significantly subsidizes additional mining at the expense of all Bitcoin holders through the block reward, but does nothing to provide incentives for decentralized transaction processing and redundancy.
@_date: 2015-07-25 14:02:28
Immersion in Bitcoin community is hazardous to a person's perspective.  Bitcoin has some great capabilities, and it has a strong network effect lead over its blockchain based competitors, but it's nowhere near competing with the network effect of major national currencies, credit cards, and other established systems.  Bitcoin also has some clear challenges and flaws to overcome, and it's far from inevitable that it will attain wide global adoption.  It's a long race to that stage, and the lead Bitcoin has isn't that significant on the scale of the distance remaining.
@_date: 2015-07-26 14:09:35
Yes, there's obviously a big difference between the developers and other investors, but that's true regardless.  The investors have to trust the developers for investing in their project to be a good idea anyway.
@_date: 2015-07-24 05:40:52
Exactly.  Currently the amount of money paid to miners influences the amount of hash power brought online, but not the amount of decentralization.  The only incentive to keep decentralization is the miners' fear of the users completely abandoning the network if they become too centralized, but short of that centralization lowers overhead costs and increases profits.
@_date: 2015-07-25 17:28:21
Burning or losing bitcoins reduces the supply that will ever be available for circulation.  Saying that they still exist, but can't ever be spent may be technically true, but isn't economically relevant.  Mining subsidies increase the supply in circulation relative to what it would be if those subsidies were burned, and increased supply in circulation (all other things being equal) applies downward force to price.  This represents an expense to Bitcoin holders.  Ideally, the value in additional security provided to the network by the miners exceeds the cost of the subsidies from Bitcoin holders, so the net impact is increased market cap, but mining is a real expense to the network, and understanding that fact is essential to understanding the economics of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-25 22:48:23
They are the same economy.  The only way miners make a profit in the "fiat economy" from mining is by selling mined Bitcoin and thus applying downward pressure on the price.  The Bitcoin network thus cannot sustain itself without accepting this downward price pressure and counteracting it by providing it's users with enough utility to attract buyers for the coins the miners are selling.
@_date: 2015-07-24 05:53:31
Good post.  It looks like we're mostly on the same page; the difference is that the points I'm making stand regardless of block size.  Whether the block size changes or not, if that's the only change up for consideration then Bitcoin will remain teetering at the "too centralized" brink indefinitely.
@_date: 2015-07-25 14:55:52
The size of the units is pretty arbitrary since they're divisible, and really has nothing to do with competitiveness.  Market cap and liquidity are better indicators.
I'm strongly in favor of decentralized financial systems, but if we don't recognize and discuss Bitcoin's flaws, how can those flaws be fixed?  The success of cryptocurrency is dependent on criticism and problem solving, not on blind fanaticism.
@_date: 2015-03-12 23:17:09
No, it isn't.  This is just like getting central banks to issue currency as user issued assets on a blockchain in addition to paper notes and other digitally tracked currency.  This is just more government enforced fiat.
@_date: 2015-02-16 07:45:39
Yeah, it's frustrating that there aren't direct USD to bitUSD or bitBTC gateways yet.  It's already nice to spend most trading time with full control of private keys, and hopefully the fiat gateways will start serving it once more people know it exists.
@_date: 2015-02-16 07:09:35
Why do you say that?  I use the BitShares exchange, and the biggest issue is still the crypto/fiat bottleneck.
@_date: 2015-02-15 21:10:16


BitShares works, but no one seems to know about it for some reason.
@_date: 2015-02-16 07:16:05
But even short term traders don't need to leave a balance at a gateway, so they're a much lower value target.  If all the trading takes place on the chain, you can leave a limit order open as long as you want without anyone else having access to the private key for your balance.
@_date: 2015-02-16 09:00:58
Higher spread is just a matter of adoption though, so that's a bit of a chicken and egg problem.  They are slower, limited by the block time, but not painfully slow, and a bit of a slowdown seems like a fair price to pay to avoid hacks.
Consistency, availability, and partition tolerance can clearly be balanced effectively with blockchains, or we wouldn't all be here.

If you use BitPay or CoinBase you're still dependent on a single third party payment processor, just one that happens to be more competitive than credit card companies at the moment.  If he's that worried about volatility he should just convert to BitUSD for long term savings.
