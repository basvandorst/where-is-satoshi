1 Bit = 0.00001BTC = approx 0.01 USD
1 mBTC = 0.001BTC = approx 1 USD
Seems to be more decimal places on the side of bits, mBTC is almost a dollar i.e. what most people are used to and most comfortable with

Theres is a big difference from where BitCoin is now and where we see proper mass adoption of crypto. If there is developed a new cryptocurrency which is undeniably better in some respect to BitCoin (see- technological progress) then that is the one that will trigger and create the standard for that mass adoption assuming BitCoin cant integrate that new technology fast enough. A bet on BitCoin is a bet that that will not happen between now and that mass adoption point. Im not saying that BitCoin doesnt look like the strongest contender right now, mainly because of it's pure numbers and it has done well to stay the relevant standard throughout extensive innovation in the field. Despite this, it is still a gamble, a chance case. None of us know what the future will bring, and betting on the wrong outcome, over paying debts that are accruing interest is going to ruin a lot of peoples lives that is a guarantee. Whether that is believing in Bitcoin or not believing in bitcoin, there are a lot of smart people on both sides of the fence, and they can't all be right.

Not everyone who invested in lofty tech initiatives that they thought were going to succeed got a win either. Bitcoin isnt the whole lottery, it's a single lottery ticket. The two are more alike than you are representing here.
Edit: forgot to finish a sentence

*post digital currency world*. Whilst I agree that the current standard is not the best and will be overtaken and replaced by something, and that something is probably going to be a cryptocurrency based system, the fact that that cryptocurrency is going to be BitCoin or BitCoin dependent is still a roll of the device, despite the traction that it has gathered and even more so before it gained that traction.
