Bitcoin is going to become worse with no adoption, so it's just a matter of time, that covers the tech part, which will improve over time, governments telling you it's a nono will make it more appealing and just increase the price. How are they gunna stop me pawning my old games console for btc from some bloke down the pub?

Once you account for education, exact job, location, the gender gap is a couple of cents, which completely needs to be fixed, but to claim that it is 78 cents on the dollar or whatever is totally disingenious because 78cent on the dollar is based on ALL women in ALL jobs vs ALL men in ALL jobs, unsurprisingly, men earn more when it take the stats like that.

This is what I'm looking for, a collection of answers I can provide to a 60/70 year old who just doesn't get it lol.

Anyone with a big interest in this guy want to send me some links of what you deem to be the best explanations for bitcoin and how it's not going away/going to disrupt current fields - I've an old man whose been ignoring me mentioning this since sub $1k bitcoin prices... I guess I don't know how to convey, or he doesn't know how to comprehend, but hes smart.

From what I've gathered from the talks I've heard A.A give the first book is the technical how bitcoin works and the second book is what bitcoin/blockchain can do in a real world scenario

You can do this whenever you want, and in the future, there will probably be an easier/safer method to retrieve your bch.

Those idiots made the big money this time :(

Your argument is too weak to say it is a scam site or ponzi. Look at it optimistically, and it could be a totally legit site, unwilling to payout to people who haven't invested.  
Your argument is definitely enough to keep an arm's width away though lol.

The guy above me called them idiots, I was merely using the word he used to describe them. Don't go attacking me for no reason lol.

I don't want to argue, and I see your point, but you said "to a rich guy like him" as though it held some weight, Which it doesn't.

Being rich holds no relevance when donating to a charity

I'm kinda curious if this will get deleted, or spur some conversation, or go ignored.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:44:16
You will just get btc, not bch

I guess the argument from the lazy person's point of view, is it's better to err on the side of caution than risk losing funds, because you didn't research.

In the same boat as you my friend, been watching since 16% of bitcoin price at 20 confirmations, now 9% and account still locked :\

I sent my funds to a newly seeded electrum wallet, then installed electron cash on a different computer and typed in my initial seed for electrum wallet, my bch is  still there, 24h later.  (saw a post of someone saying their coins got "stolen")

I verified my ID using pictures from my phone. One of my ID close up, and one of me holding my ID

Sound advice, but of course there are the odd exception, places where people don't pay for electricity, but don't have start up funds, being able to get 3rd parties to pay for the mining rig is all they'd need

The idea of bitcoin is that the amount produced every 4 years is halved and as time progresses, transaction fees will increase and become the incentive for the miners to continue operating.  
Bitcoin is backed by a cryptographic code, complex maths questions need solving, all the miners work to solve it, whoever gets there first, gets the reward of bitcoin.  Your explanation of how useless fiat currency is, and that bitcoin is no different is spot on, at the end of the day they are both totally redundant, how you want to store your wealth while the option is there, is what this is about. I think most bitcoin advocates would say gold is still smarter/safer than bitcoin.  
Bitcoin fees are smaller than with banks for sure, but they are increasing with more users using bitcoin. Coinbase (popular bitcoin exchange) lets you buy/sell bitcoin with 1.5% fees, and buy with creditcard for 4% in most places. Most crypto exchanges have much smaller fees like 0.25%  
Cashing out doesn't have a fee of nearly 10% at all.. and the transaction fee is roughly the same size depending on sending $1 or $1000   
You have to trust the exchange when you had over your fiat currency, the same as you do with ebay, amazon etc. Once you have the bitcoin, you don't have to have faith in any recipient.  
Yes, if you don't protect your bitcoins you can lose them, same as if you left your bank password saved on mozilla? there are cold wallet storages devices with no connectivity to the internet for safe keeping of bitcoin.  
A quick google of north korea and bitcoin shows lots of news results, hackers over there stealing it and what not.. so yea I'd say, bitcoin is fairly invasive.  
The fees you pay to the miner who processes your transaction, his computer does the work to get your transaction logged onto the network, more miners come along after and further confirm it, getting a smaller chunk of the fee.  
Credit cards that use bitcoin are freely available, so you wouldn't have an issue there if you didn't want one. The point you're making here, is that it isn't fully adopted yet, which is very true, imagine how much it would cost if it was.  
Why would you want a currency with limited supply like gold, rather than a fiat currency where the banks just freely print more and your hardwork becomes less valuable? Who knows..  
By no means have I responded to everything, just a few!

Considering their business model was fraud and not a single individual was punished for their actions. It feels right to be against the dudes that cause an economic crisis and walk away scot-free with a boat load of cash.

Look at all the other currencies out there, some are processor mining limited, or gpu limited etc, and all alternative currencies are tethered against bitcoin, so you can just sell it for bitcoin and sit on that :D
