Did you lose in Mt Gox?
@_date: 2014-02-17 05:39:21
I'm talking about BTC-e.  Context clues, they're your friend.
@_date: 2014-03-18 12:31:41
Amen.  I wish that everyone would get to the point of just accepting that you need to trade then move your coins to a good wallet storage system &lt;insert debate here about what/where that is&gt;.  It really matters little what exchange you're on in terms of exposure if you are handling the process the right way.
Oh and to go ahead and say it, why another baseless attack on BTC-e?
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:02:37
heh, yeah true.
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:13:15
Arise chikun, to da noob!!
@_date: 2014-02-02 13:54:39
Great, thank you for explaining.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:08:24
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:09:57
yep, agreed.  Maybe this was a big enough spill to make them want to do it.  They have to realize the best way to gain new customers right now is by proving they are reputable and trustworthy.

How many freaking people were privy to this secret/surprise information for there to be a price run - and it didn't end up in  or @_date: 2014-02-25 02:58:57
You. You sir. My hero.  You. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:10:45
be my friend

Thank you for coming back.  So, the only reason that btc-e checks for confirmation is for double-spending prevention, and that is only because it is presumably a large BTC transaction?
@_date: 2014-02-02 01:40:48
interesting, thank you.
@_date: 2014-02-02 01:33:07
I appreciate you answering.  Are you saying that if you have 0 confirmations that there is proof the bitcoin sender does in fact have enough uBTC to cover the transaction?
@_date: 2014-02-02 13:54:05
Thanks for answering, but I am not sure how you get that.  We authorize a credit card in 3-4 seconds, and then batch at the end of the night.  If you're saying that a customer can dispute a charge for 90 days, then I guess I see what you're saying - but from a business standpoint the money is in our account the following day.
@_date: 2014-02-02 01:33:52
Same question as below, and thank you for answering.  You cannot fake the amount of BTC you're sending?

If you were making gobs of money with little regard to the price of bitcoin, would you close down your gravy train?  Yes, trade % is based on bitcoin $$ figure traded, but just like duke and duke they make money no matter if it goes up or goes down...
Personally I think you ought to check yourself if you are a true BTC investor and making comments like this.  To me, it's like standing in front of the restaurant you just invested in and telling every customer "I've never been in the cooler, but I think everything is rotten, because I think so".

Bernie Madoff got/gets death threats.

I love the fact that they say they are about to publish audited financial reports.  Isn't this the first step towards transparency we all need?
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:30:42
Scary.  I hope they're just communications challenged and not really shady...
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:19:33
I like the idea, but it sounds like you're attempting to boil the ocean.  How will this ever work?
@_date: 2014-02-02 03:25:08
Thank you all for your thought and answers!
@_date: 2014-02-18 04:13:39
So you're using Sheep &amp; Tor Mkt as the comparison for your case?  You're right, they're gonna take your money and run.  I'd get out now.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:56:28
I hate to say I don't know, but I have read it several times in several places.  I know I should have data backup for saying this but I am not in googling kind of mood.
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:24:07
Is bitcoin really the right CC for this?  I mean 30 minute blockchain verification?
I want this..bad..but the time to process?
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:00:42
Hey just a thank you for this info.  I hate Chase bank and I thought there were no nationwide viable alternatives.
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:50:36
nice, lmao.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:49:30
I'm with you, but there has to be another way. I hear nobody "who knows" uses mt gox, but now maybe I will.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:09:25
This is the post I'll refer to every time I get "that selling feeling".
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:09:16
More power to you.  FWIW I manage POS and technology for a reasonably sized retailer in Texas.  The allure of not paying acquisition of fees on money "straight off the top" where profit is would be compelling.  Might I suggest getting a large retailer on board and using that to force the POS people?
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:02:35
respect.  but right now I have a gordon gekko thing going on.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:51:52
Isn't coinbase always lagging?  I assumed they use some kind of weighted average in their buy/sell algo.

1) If BTC-e was a scam, there'd be 100s of reddit posts about things happening.  I recall reading a similar post about cryptsy being slow, and every said "They're dirty/scamming/thieves".
2) We're all in an emerging market with trading growth in the realm of exponential numbers over the last few weeks.  There's going to be issues!
3) It's typical reddit on some of this, but consider for a moment that we're all early adopters.  It is better for all of us invested in any cryptocurrency having more people involved in the trading and transfer of goods and services using LTC or BTC.  Putting a post like this, titled like this - is not helping.
Do I have too much money tied up in BTC-e and Cryptsy?  Yeah probably.  Do I think they're going to steal my money?  Nope.
It's my humble suggestion that if you're a BTC or LTC investor, that you assume a role of quasi-ambassador and not make posts intending to freak people out.  I get it, something has happened with your account.  But it was with BTC and not other currencies.  The website is online, the admins are tweeting updates, people are actively trading.
