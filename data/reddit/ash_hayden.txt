Hi Jorge, 
I'm actually in Coeur d' Alene Idaho. I definitely be there if I were closer. 
Cheers.

We are working on something similar. ;) 
@_date: 2014-01-08 03:23:54
We'll be teaching the community about bitcoin while enjoying fine cocktails.

Great JorgePasada! I'm working on getting a handful of other businesses set up. Everyday I work behind the bar I'm teaching patrons about it and now I can demonstrate it right there in front of them.

Awesome! Thanks for sharing!

They reached out to me this morning. The local paper interview me last week and that article is circulating all over the Northwest. Seattle Times just republished it. I have a radio interview in the morning for some AM radio show based in Seattle. There is actually a lot more press contacting me as well a locals that want to learn and see BTC demonstrations. It's exciting.

It was the John Carlson show and they had me on at 8:30. I'm not sure if they podcast their shows? I'd imagine they do. If you can find the podcast let me know. Here is a link to the live shows.

Cheers! We'll be doing other BTC deals too! 
@_date: 2014-01-17 22:02:39
The news crew was nice. We have had a bitcoin transaction everyday since we announced.

As in you'll have to wait and see ;).

I told him that I'd actually mine the alt coins like litecoin, name coin, anon coin etc. He's game for this. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 06:32:12
I think this is what the lords of centralized currency/banking look like when they discuss bitcoin amongst each other. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:41:14
Thank you for the insight. You're right, this is critical. What about mining alt currencies at this time on perhaps outdated tech? 
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:30:35
I am not sure on any money limit. I'd imagine he'd start off with 5 -10k. 
I got into bitcoins about a year ago and would be able to make the purchases with my btc and he would reimburse me in usd so I can buy my btc back. 
Will the technology be obsolete buy the time I receive it? 
I'm thinking of mining some of the alt coins as well. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:35:04
What about mining other crypto's?

I'm not sure. He said we can fill up the upstairs of his bar with whatever I need. His rent on the bar includes all utility costs. The building is over 20 stories.

The online merchant has an opportunity to make additional sales. He is netting in one month what most make in one or two years. He has a great niche and the bitcoin community might likely buy his products.

What is e-mail backed by? I guess we should all go back to writing snail mail.

I agree. BTC is the only one where an economy is actualizing. But, I can trade alt coins for BTC. I don't have to put any of my own money in on this partnership. My boss just isn't tech savvy and I can figure anything out. Ultimately my question is, do you think it's viable to purchase mining equipment to mine alt coins such as litecoin, anoncoin, feathercoin, namecoin etc and then sell some or all of those coins for BTC? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:25:45
I am sure FinCEN came out last march and said something similar. 
I am currently setting up many brick and mortar businesses right now to accept bitcoin. This news reemerging is unsettling. I'm sure that all of the companies I'm working with will decide to end their partnership with me. 
What can I or anyone do about this? 
@_date: 2013-12-12 06:40:20
This is an outline of what I am doing. After the first business I helped I got networked with a dozen other entrepreneurs that were interested in BTC. So I put this little class together. 
  * Browsing Anonymously: Surf the web securely and learn about the dark net and deep web.
  * File Sharing the safe way: Sync any authorized device seamlessly without compromising your privacy with 3rd parties.
  * Encrypting Files: Secure your digital property.
  * Becoming your own anonymous bank.
    * What is Bitcoin?
    * Pro's of Bitcoin
    * Acquiring Bitcoin
    * Storing Bitcoin
    * Accepting Bitcoin in your store online or brick and mortar.
   * Use your bit coins anywhere in the world without compromising your security. 
* Private secure texting and cloaking your email: Communicate privately and securely with people you trust and communicate anonymously with those you don't.

I understand the risks. Basically my boss will put up 5k or so for a miner and whatever else. There will be no energy bill increase as he has a contracted that his bar rent includes all utility costs. 
What would you do?
