14.3! Holy Moly!  Glad I live in the NW! Definitely makes even more sense for you to go solar.  Luckily Washington State has a 50% incentive so combined with the 30% federal I'm doing pretty good.
That's one area I overlooked with the generation.  The panels will generate on a curve each day.  
Here's a screenshot of my generation from yesterday, for example. 
Happy generating! :)

Congrats on going solar! I just got my own installed. I’m curious if you’re actually seeing 180kwh per day? I have a 12kw system and my top daily generation is about 85 right now. I have 35 panels facing south and 5 facing east.

Hundreds of thousands? 
At an average power bill of let’s say $150 x 12 months x 25 years is $45k. Going solar is a good investment but I think your numbers are a bit off.

I would check the rate history of your local utility to calculate instead of national averages.  Rates don't always increase, sometimes they go down, sometimes they stay the same.  For example, at my utility the kWh price in 2003 was 7.6 cents and today is 7.18 cents.  
Does your utility actually pay you cash for your excess generation?  Mine credits any excess generation that I build up and use when the usage is highest in the winter.
I commented elsewhere in this thread but want to ask here.  Are you actually seeing 180kWh per day?  According to Google Project Sunroof my roof has 1681 hours of usable sun each year.  With my 12kw system that is an average of 54 kWh per day - though this isn't accounting for efficiency losses.  In the middle of summer here my daily peaks are about 85.
