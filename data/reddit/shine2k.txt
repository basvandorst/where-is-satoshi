Is that possible with electrum?

I just bought the base model Pro without the touch bar. I'm so jealous
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:37:48
I can't figure out how to do it. Can someone give me a link it explanation?
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:42:55
I'm just concerned because I was trying to send BCC but my wallet is saying I have lost that same amount of BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:59:24
I hope their support can help me out, otherwise RIP $1200
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:34:25
No, it's the only wallet I've ever used.
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:29:31
Some people take Amazon cards on LocalBitcoins.com
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:34:00
How can nobody have the coins anymore? They just disappeared?
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:08:44
The guy above said the seed can't be extracted though
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:32:18
I wasn't trying to generate BCH out of nothing if that's what you're saying. I had BTC before the fork and I was trying to dump the shitcoin for some real Bitcoin. I didn't realize I was sending away my Bitcoin because I didn't know Electrum doesn't support Shitcoin. Anyways I made a support request and I'm hoping I get my BTC back. Thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:58:44
Doesn't that mean I'm fucked if I lose the trezor?
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:17:30
Who is this guy? I’ve seen pictures of him here and there but I have no idea who he is.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:54:42
Yeah, I just realized. They kind of hide the option because you have to go through the settings to enable it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:25:37
I’ve only done online transactions, people have payed me with stolen bank account info. I almost lost out on $5000, but I convinced the bank I wasn’t a thief and they let me keep it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:57:12
Thanks for the tip! I really did waste that money on the fee because it wasn’t urgent at all, just moving BTC to a paper wallet. Lesson learned
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:42:53
I set the minimum fee on electrum this morning, got charged $15

My dad is an immigrant, I’ve never met any of his family.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:21:58
That’s never happened to me, I’m in Canada. Although most of the time I just post my own buy ads, saves about 10% that way. Watch out for scammers, they are pretty common.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:53:40
636 byte tx, 292 sat/byte, fee of 0.00186 BTC, or $14.49 USD. I blame electrum. 
Nevermind, it was my own fault for not disabling dynamic fees. Lesson learned I suppose
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:59:24
I'll probably never have a whole Bitcoin. I have almost 0.5 and I'm 16 and unemployed so by the time I have money to buy the price will be too expensive.
@_date: 2017-09-12 02:12:46
Right. Each choice you make should be statistically in your favor or 50/50. That's why some people suck at blackjack and others make millions.
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:26:51
I think all these people saying $10k+ are just wishful thinkers
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:30:15
You traded because you are not an experienced trader?
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:59:49
Have you ever heard of poverty?

Hey there, I'd like a small coloured roller coaster shirt if I win. Thanks!

1. Go to gdax and make an address to send you BTC to. Put that address into Coinbase when you send it away.
2. Yes it is but it's a shitty one.
3. It's like buying a new sports car and letting your friend drive it around. Your friend could get in an accident and lose your car. Coinbase could get hacked and lose your Bitcoin. If you put the btc in another wallet (away from an exchange) then the security of it is up to you.
4. Trezor, a hardware wallet, is probably your best option. Electrum is a free software alternative but idk if it supports segwit
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:59:30
Buy back in OP!
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:23:24
It's $2k CAD, so like $1600 USD. I'm only 16, so I really have no idea what to do. Should I just switch banks and pretend it never happened?
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:42:02
LocalBitcoins is not too bad. Most people just need a picture of your driver's license or passport and you're good to go. You pay a higher price though.
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:18:56
There's a website called cryptospout that pays Bitcoin or alt coins for doing surveys and signing up for stuff. I earned 0.001 in a few days. It's not much but it's something.
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:01:11
iPhone X is $1300 in Canada :(
@_date: 2017-09-02 04:07:59
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:25:50
I got a reply and they said I will get it back in about 3 weeks. Shitty to wait so long but I would be hodling either way.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:59:30

@_date: 2017-09-12 02:10:09
That's not even remotely true.
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:07:00
Bitcoin could fall to $0 in 10 years. What's your point?
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:39:13
I just realized that many people regret not buying Bitcoin but almost no one regrets buying Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:57:02
Nope, this is my first time posting here.
Edit: This is completely independent, I wasn't told to do this by anyone.
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:58:09
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:47:22
That number is probably closer to a million.

I don't know why I didn't think of that. Thank you
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:56:35
I have no idea how loans work but that sounds like bullshit. Why would anyone pay it back if they can wait 30 years and have their debt disappear?
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:11:24
If you want to own Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin. No one can tell you whether the price tomorrow I'll be $0 or $100000
@_date: 2017-09-12 02:06:24
But you get to make a choice when you get dealt your first two cards. If you bust it is your own fault 100% of the time.
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:29:37


And what makes you any different?


Damn right I can.
If it really is this bad I'll honestly just kill myself. I'm not gonna deal with this shit

$5344 in Canadian dollars.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:56:19
Sold at 5531. Hoping to get back in at $5k. I don't think this current price is sustainable. My first time trading, with my luck I'll get burned.
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:37:10
That sounds like a good plan. I'll ask around in but I'll probably end up doing what you described.
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:57:45
I bought from coinmama a week ago, only took about an hour to get my btc, everything went smoothly.
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:11:27
Where would you travel?
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:30:30
A true Bitcoin miner.
Could you just go nuts with an eff 5 diamond pick and mine netherrack? I'm assuming it probably didn't work that way.
How much btc did you end up with?
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:14:32
All of it?
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:12:48
What would you spend your time doing?
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:43:58
@_date: 2017-07-12 02:43:01
If it does happen, people will be talking all about it on this sub. Just wait and see. Personally I have no idea how to answer your question :P
