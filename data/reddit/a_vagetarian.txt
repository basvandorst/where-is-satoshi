534 btc is over half a million. Probably shouldn't be posting that publicly.

Can you memorize january through December? Pretend you're learning your months all over again. Your child brained kid self memorized a widely used word string easily.

$200 is a tiny market cap. Never gonna happen again.

Premium sucks if he's going short
If he's going long it doesn't really matter.

I don't want to move coins onto an exchange unless I plan to make an action. The price is the variable that'd determine what decision I make.

You got downvoted but you're not wrong.

You're lucky to get 2% annually from a bank

This one comment has to infuriate u/JeffTXD
@_date: 2017-03-18 06:02:58
Pretty much. Try explaining that to someone who thinks capitalism or trying to earn a profit is evil.

BU/SW debate is like the 2016 election all over again. Any1 else feel that way?

You guys used a fucking google doc to review this?
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:48:39
You mean we're almost at mt.gox level. Not the other way around. During mtgox btc was so young and just finished a dumb monied bubble and caused a death spiral. This is a much more mature event (in that people aren't participating in a downward deathspiral causing btc to hit low 200s.).
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:21:36
Yes. Yes you will.
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:31:00
Yeah that's a healthy way to move a market

You mean it's the first day BCH mining has been more profitable to mine than BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:45:58
Not wrong sub. A shitty coin is inflating the volume maliciously. As a bitcoin holder that concerns me and it should concern you too. Gl next time 
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:30:11
Do you really need to install on different computer if your pc is 100% offline?

Thanks. Better safe than sorry.

Holy shit read that in Trump's voice and it totally sounds like it came straight out of a trump rally.
@_date: 2017-04-19 21:05:08
Cheers for the tip.
@_date: 2017-04-19 19:26:50
Thanks. Derp this is the easiest option. I heard there was a site that printed out codes people can enter to process a transaction to their wallet. However a peper wallet is best. 
Yeah I already factored fees and I'm ready to pay em.
@_date: 2017-04-19 19:23:36
If you have your seed you can import to a wallet that doesn't require a node e.g. electrum

I know right? First day on the Internet kid meme alert.

Is this video supposed to be funny? I mean the jpeg version is funny but the video is TERRIBLE
Bad audio with obviously racist impersonation of chinese individuals. Like they call it south Park style but that's that's a total joke to say because this is nothing like south park

The way I see it, we've seen worse through volatility. It could keep dropping to 3000 but I believe that will be our absolute bottom.
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:03:01
Actually, symbolically, yes.

Weren't we doubting newspaper articles when they were saying china banned btc? How this different?
@_date: 2017-09-11 07:17:08
I'm still convinced the financial collapse of 2008 brought us bitcoin.

Who said I liked Martin? I said I liked no one here. Including op, this comment, you, and Shkreli 
Did you just assume my thoughts?

It def holds merit since it wasn't long ago btc had those numbers.

How shady? Restrict selling on exchanges so drops aren't that brutal :^)

Don't post with selective data. Use the same source. 
Btc has 8.35b$ last 24hr which is 2.5x ETH's.

Afaik blockchain.info doesn't track all transactions (some countries are ignored, correct me if I'm wrong). Bitinfo I've seen to have the most reliable data.
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:07:01
Still a stupid post. Look at time it was posted. Barely had its first bubble when this released lol
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:52:45
Did not know. For a second I thought they were an imposter site.
