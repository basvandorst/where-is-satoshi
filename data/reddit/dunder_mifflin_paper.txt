Watching that guy weld....doesn't look like he welds too much.
@_date: 2018-08-26 12:43:55
I don't think this guy is homeless. He looks like a delivery driver just chilling out for a bit. His home is probably a long way away so he has a few mod cons there with him in the city as he works. As for electricity its pretty easy to hook up if you know how.

From today's price that would be a market cap 11.9 trillion.

Tomoorow on TIFU Majache tells us how he lost 100k in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-01 12:35:26

This title is bullshit, Apple deleted it by accident and then relisted it.

I just thought he was Spanish, that's all.

This article is trash, no info and looks scammy

Fun fact. Christopher Columbus was Italian. As an Australian this was a complete surprise to me. My Italian cousins were not impressed
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:49:49
They were upset because I didn't know he was Italian.

1. 20.19% APR – Investing in continued leveraged Bitcoin trading
2. 53.10% APR – Investing in trading and mining operations
3. 16.3% APR – Investing in backing a new crypto based business
TOO. GOOD. TO. BE. TRUE.

There was that Reddit thread where a guy's life was in the shitter and he went for broke by using 30k from his credit cards. I wonder how he is doing
@_date: 2016-07-03 22:46:42
Yes as well as the "secret" part of his job description.  Its like he skipped agent 101 class and the secret 101 class.

Why would you be a fool if someone was going to pay you a shitload of money for your coins. Especially if you were an early adopter and paid cents..... Or less than cents.  I would say your a fool for not capitalising on a huge price at this current point in time
