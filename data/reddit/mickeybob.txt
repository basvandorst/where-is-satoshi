Please consider that the weaker chain would be a very easy target for 51% attack by a large pool on the stronger chain. Hash power is the only vote toward consensus. On this issue, miners rule and 75% power is more than enough to ensure consensus.

There will for a short time be two, but the very reason why we don't have other sha256 altcoins is because they would get attacked in this way.
When one chain achieves a large majority in hash power, the attack will come through some mining pool selling the weaker coin and then computing and revealing a longer weak chain.
Two chains is not sustainable.

Is there already a service offering this capability to small businesses? Seems like a big opportunity. I could see two pieces:
One is the ability to create receipts each with a new QR code, label them, and indicate which has been paid in real-time by monitoring the bitcoin network. You wouldn't need to wait 10 min for confirmation; probably just a few seconds to get enough of an assurance against a double-spend broadcast for small amounts. 
The second piece would just allow you to define your own inventory (store) or menu items (restaurant) so that you could quickly itemize for a new receipt by just clicking what the person ordered. But this is really less of an absolute requirement and for the big players would need custom integration into an existing inventory system anyway.

There is competition in this space, and the costs continue to drop. Coinbase and Bitpay are the big US players but in either case the conversion costs are much less than credit card processor fees. Here's a link to the bitpay fees page:  (Coinbase_Rees can speak for coinbase.)

If cost to transmit a block is decoupled from block size, then wouldn't we expect there to be far more transactions per block? And why not problematically so? Blockchain history size has been kept under control by block size limitations, but couldn't we see this balloon out of control, or would we still be using a 1mb block size limit to control this?

It's Coinbase moving the coins around into storage. Remember -- the keys to that address you are using (1McNsCTN26zkBSHs9fsgUHHy8u5S1PY5q3) are held by Coinbase and the money deposited there can be moved only by the person with the keys, which is *not* you. Generally, if you are storing a significant amount of bitcoin you will want to generate your own address so that you can be sure only you control the funds.
@_date: 2014-04-06 20:07:44
Here's my take:
You can only "control the price of gold with USD" to an extent. The price of gold has been going up mostly over the last 40 years because the number of dollars in existence has continued to rise. This, in large part, due to the federal reserve having continually lowered interest rates ever since the dollar stopped being pegged to gold. If you think of the world's nominal assets (gold/dollars/euros etc) each sharing a slice of a big nominal asset pie, then gold already occupies 10% or so of that pie at $1,000 oz. So when people talk about gold being worth 100x or 10x more than it is today, they are not saying that all the value of all the nominal assets is going to rise so much. What they are really saying is that more dollars are going to be created, and as a result each dollar will be worth less, such that gold might still occupy 10% of the pie, but since there are so many more dollars being created it will take more of them to buy 1 oz of gold.
The federal reserve bank can control the value of a single dollar, because it has the ability to create and destroy dollars at will. However, although it can control the value of a single dollar, it has a more difficult time controlling the total value of "all the dollars together" because this is largely based on the strength/production of the US economy, (and many other factors).
With regard to bitfinex contracts being settled in USD: the future price being traded is the future price of bitcoins as measured in US dollars. The fact that this is being margined/settled in USD does not really materially affect things, because the final expiring price of the contract is still based on the value of a real bitcoin as measured in real USD. In other words: when you go long somebody else goes short. If the price moves up, then the guy on the other side of the contract pays you and vice versa. So he might have to pay you a dollar every time the bitcoin price moves up a dollar, or he might have to pay you $100 dollars every time the bitcoin price moves up a dollar, or he might have to pay you six peanuts every time the bitcoin price moves up a dollar (these payments are called margin) but the point is the underlying price is still based on the real price of BTC as measured in USD, and so the margin that moves is still proportional to this underlying price.
In fact, the US S&amp;P future contract (symbol ES) is cash settled and margined in USD, but it is priced based on the value of the S&amp;P 500. So no shares of S&amp;P are actually delivered when the contract expires.
Regarding the ability to "borrow money at 0%". This interest rate is actually what will keep the futures contract price in line with the underlying. In other words, the december S&amp;P 500 futures price will equal today's S&amp;P price plus the cost to borrow the USD between now and when the contract expires (nearly zero percent right now), minus the expected dividend payments:  . Effectively this lets anyone borrow money at near-zero interest rates and invest it in the S&amp;P, and it'll let people do the same with bitcoin too. 
This is a bit to get your head around all at once so happy to answer questions.

Is it possible that roughly half the network might measure difficulty as being A, and the other half as being B -- which might perhaps occur because of slight differences in measuring the time it took for the last 2016 blocks to be found? (Such measurement differences could be do to network latency/network service interruption etc) If this were to occur it could be dangerous because it could cause a fork in the blockchain as a block was found that satisfied one difficulty but not the other.

It's because most people store their bitcoins in their own wallets (instead of coinbase) where such a transaction in the blockchan would imply a user-initiated movement.

It's worth noting that many bitcoin clients will allow you to create a *wallet* which is effectively a grouping of one or more *addresses*, each of which will have its own private key. Transactions to a wallet can be made to any of its addresses, and when sending money out of the wallet, the client will automatically choose which addresses to move the funds out of. The blockchain only deals with addresses, but for privacy people do create many addresses, oftentimes generating a new address for each transaction.

The wealth transfer effect from those who transact to those who do not transact still exists whether or not you have an inflationary / unlimited supply. 
Whether or not the currency is inflationary / unlimited supply, is totally separate from PoW / PoS.
The important thing with PoW is that you do not continually give anyone a larger slice of the pie for doing nothing. Yes in PoS it's bad because that slice is just being given to waste instead of something useful, but at least it's not going toward giving someone a bigger slice, which is unsustainable.
A non-wasteful solution would be to have PoW, but have the "work" actually be something useful. And in fact someone could pay the whole network to have his work computed through the act of provably destroying coins.

You would have to import the private key into a bitcoin client like multibit or bitcoin-qt, etc. in order to spend the account. *Remember: You can only spend the bitcoin address using the corresponding private key.* 
With a paper wallet you're just writing down the private key on a piece of paper so an attacker can't grab it remotely. With an encrypted private key (BIP38) you're encrypting what's on that piece of paper, so even if an attacker were to get physical access to your paper he couldn't do anything unless he also knew the password that you had memorized.

You won't run out of digits because every zero you add to the difficulty is an exponential increase in difficulty. Finding a hash of nearly all zeros (very high difficulty) is just *way* too hard based on how powerful our computers are or are foreseen to become even if they grow in power substantially. 
Should computing power vastly (as in -- way, way, vastly in unforeseen ways) or more likely should weaknesses be found in sha256, then yes: sha256 it can be swapped out for a different or more difficult  hashing function which would be like "adding more decimal places". But right now sha256 is far more than strong enough.

So imagine that one rich guy owns 20% of all the coins. He mostly just sits on them and doesn't really spend any.
This guy hangs out and signs PoS blocks, and by the time a year is up, he now owns something like 20.5% of all coins (because he has collected coins from signing the PoS blocks). 
Fast forward a few years. This guy now owns 25% of the coins, and so on.
What's going on?
Money effectively serves two purposes: (1) to store value, and (2) to transact value. 
With PoS, you're effectively transferring wealth from those who use the currency as a means of transaction to those who use the currency as a means of wealth storage. In other words: it pays money to not transact your money. 
As more of the currency shifts from the hands of those using it as a means of transaction to those using it as long-term wealth storage, there becomes less currency available for use as a means of transaction, until eventually there is almost nothing left for use as a means of transaction.
Yes, with PoW this same effect occurs: money is still transferred away from those using the currency as a means of transaction, but the difference is that those people who are receiving the currency through PoW are incurring a cost, so they cannot just "sit there" and net become wealthier, at the expense of others and no risk to themselves. 
Please don't compare earning money through PoS as "earning interest on your money", because they are very different things: in one case you are being paid a premium for taking a real risk by giving up control of your money to another entity, in the other case, you are being paid for literally doing nothing.
Any economic system that pays some of the people for doing literally nothing is not sustainable, because the people who are doing the paying are not going to put up with it once they figure out what's going on. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 13:11:04
To answer this well you need to think about how much you expect all the bitcoins together should be worth, versus how much all the gold together should be worth. Right now all the bitcoins are worth about $5 billion and all the gold is worth roughly $8-$10 trillion. 
All the world's nominal assets (gems/gold/silver/all the worlds government currencies) are together worth maybe $75 trillion or so. If you add US treasuries and other similar government debt you might get another $25 trillion or so give or take. How much of this $100 trillion pie should be occupied by gold? How much of it should be occupied by Bitcoins? How much should be occupied by US Dollars etc?
To answer that, you have to realize that all of these nominal assets are only worth something because they conveniently facilitate trade and store wealth. In and of itself a US dollar bill is just a piece of paper and not useful for anything, but people like to use a dollar bill to trade for other things and store wealth because it's convenient; i.e. you can't put a bag of wheat in your pocket, but you can fit many bills; you can easily divide a bill into smaller bills or coins etc; you can't store wealth in a pile of bananas for 5 years, but you can store that wealth in the form of US Treasuries etc. So bottom line is that all nominal value things only have value because they facilitate trade and store wealth, and the total value of all of them is currently about $100 trillion (but this too can fluctuate based on global demand for trade).
Following with this, the reason why all the gold occupies about $8-$10 trillion of this $100 trillion, and all the US dollars occupy about $16 trillion or so is decided by the freely traded market based on how much people want gold versus dollars, which is broadly based on global political and economic conditions. If for example somehow world war three were to begin next week, you can bet that people would get scared and all the value of the world's gold would go way up, and probably also the less stable/smaller country government currencies would drop in value relative to the more stable/larger country government currencies, etc. So the point is that all these nominal assets can and do fluctuate in value relative to one another as traded in the open market, and their values are set based on how much people want them based on market demand which is based on how well they facilitate trade and store wealth and of course also in consideration of political events etc.
Historically it used to be the case that there were no nominal assets (i.e. people bartered usually for wheat), then gold came along as a nominal asset, and then currencies came along to share the nominal asset pie with gold, etc. The only reason the pie comprised purely of gold ceded a slice to government currencies was convenience (i.e. dollars are just easier to deal with than gold). So the argument for Bitcoin is similar. You have to compare it against the various dimensions of nominal assets that might make them better or worse than one another (wealth transaction convenience and storage durability) and ask whether it makes sense that people might prefer to store wealth in one versus the other based on these characteristics. 
This is a lot to go into here, but to do this you need to look at dimensions of counterfeiting, ease of transaction, ease to carry, theft risk, government/inflation risk, etc. The people that think Bitcoins could be worth $1Million are basing this on the fact that they think that based on these various characteristics, people will prefer Bitcoins as a nominal asset to something like gold or dollars because they think bitcoins are superior along these dimensions. So they look at all the bitcoins being worth $5 billion and all the gold being worth give or take $10 trillion, and they say, "wait a minute bitcoins are a better nominal asset than gold and therefore all the bitcoins should be worth more than all the gold". Going from $5 billion to $10 trillion is a 2,000x increase, which is were the $1million valuation is coming from.
I recommend you decide for yourself whether any of this makes sense to you, and then based on that you should make a decision as to what you expect all the bitcoins should be worth, and then base your long term investment expectations on that.

The value of each bitcoin is related to the number of people using bitcoin -- which is related to the number of transactions.
Extra revenue for miners isn't going to come from capacity-constraining the network. In real terms -- the extra revenue is going to come from building infrastructure that can accommodate more users.
Big jets fly with empty seats. Movies play in big theaters to just a few patrons. Constraining capacity with smaller blocks puts an artificial ceiling on the capacity of the system, but it isn't going to bring in more money.

Peter: the thing that gives a currency its value is its many users. For example, the reason why "all the USD" are worth so much more than "all the bitcoin" is due in large part to the fact that there are many more people using USD.
Given the choice, people will probably prefer to use a coin that is not audited by governments.
If the government acquires mining power either through influencing existing miners, or through constructing their own hardware -- and if the government uses that equipment to mine for "audit-coin" -- that does not imply that just because "audit-coin" has more hash-power behind it, that it will have more people preferring to use it.
Even given the choice in a hard-fork between bitcoin and "audit-coin" you will have more people who choose to use bitcoin, even if audit-coin has more mining power. So the acquisition of mining power by governments and use of that mining power to create an audited coin isn't going to affect the existence of Bitcoin in any way.
Similar logic holds for increasing the block-size: given the choice between a ledger that has a constrained transaction limit, versus one that has no such constraints, the one without constraints will accumulate more users and therefore grow to have the highest total value.
Do you agree? If not -- what am I missing? How is it good for a currency to constrain how many people can use it?

On the short order timescale, if we maintain a transaction limit, then fees might rise as users compete to have their transactions inserted into a block. However the long-order effects of capacity constraints are damning: 
If capacity becomes a limitation, rest assured somebody somewhere is going to fork Bitcoin to run without capacity constraints and you’ll have two networks — one which can grow, and one which cannot.
Users have a choice as to which transaction-network they use. Just like Bitcoin is gradually accumulating users in the face of currencies such as the USD / Euro / Gold, because it’s “Better Money”, similar economics will cause “unconstrained bitcoin” to gradually accumulate more users than “capacity-constrained Bitcoin.” 
Currency derives its value from the number of people who wish to use it; the unconstrained system will become worth more than the constrained-system, and will ultimately become the more secure / preferred blockchain.
Regarding the need for constraints to drive transaction fees: buses, trains, airplanes, movie theaters, football games, etc. charge fees without running at full capacity. Imagine managing a growing football league and deciding to limit game viewership to 2,000 people / game. On the short-order, maybe putting that limit in place might drive up ticket prices, but over the long-term somebody else is going to come along and start a better league that has no such constraint. Without a capacity constraint, that other league will grow to have more viewership and outright replace yours.
The important take-away from this is that the capacity of Bitcoin is going to increase. The only question is how we pull it off, and whether that happens in a smooth transition. I urge developers to recognize this reality, and do the responsible thing to ensure as smooth a transition as possible.
@_date: 2015-05-07 14:52:56
Presently the bitcoin network is mostly funded by block rewards through inflation. You're saying that in order to maintain security, the transaction fee will need to increase to a prohibitively high level to compensate for the decrease in the block reward. I think you're pretty much right, except in the case where market cap grows to be very large.
Today the BTC market cap is about $3 Billion. Imagining no block reward, we might optimistically expect about 10,000 BTC ($2.3 million) per year in transaction fees. So with 51% you could either mine honestly for a long time and maybe make a few tens of millions of dollars, or you could take out a $100 M notional short position and mount an attack, which would probably be more profitable.
If the market cap of bitcoin is bigger though, then all those numbers get magnified: for a BTC market cap of $30 Trillion, you would need a short position of around $1Trillion. I think that might be prohibitively difficult.
@_date: 2015-05-06 08:06:15
Five years ago computing and bandwidth resources were about 20% of what they are today. You could have made this exact same argument then saying we should have capacity-constrained Bitcoin at 20% * 1MB = 200 KB blocks.
So maybe we should have done it they way, forcing a capacity constraint down even lower so that we would have already stopped usage growth years ago.
Whether you like it or not, people are going to make transactions. They are either going to make those transactions with Bitcoin, or with "not Bitcoin".
If "not Bitcoin" has no capacity-constraint, they'll just move on to using that for the majority of the their transactions. If you think somehow they'll choose to incur the costs of a currency exchange in order to convert their "not Bitcoin" to Bitcoin and the "settle up" by making a transaction on the Bitcoin Blockchain, I think you're missing an understanding of how this works:
If unconstrained "not Bitcoin" grows to more users than Bitcoin, then all the "not Botcoin" will be worth more than all the Bitcoin. Since this value secures the blockchain, the "not Bitcoin" blockchain will become the more secure / preferred ledger. 
Bitcoin is either going to change its design to be unconstrained, or it's going to get replaced by something else can handle demand. Which should we pick?

This won't necessarily be a problem for bitcoin. Someday keeping your own bitcoin address keys on your pc will be like keeping your own gold buried in your backyard. Yes, some people will still do it, but the majority of people will keep their assets in a bank, or in the case of bitcoin in an ewallet. This is exactly for the reason of fraud protection, but also to earn interest and all the other same reasons people keep money in banks today. What do the banks get in return? They get the ability to make some levels of loans on the bitcoin deposits and keep the difference in interest between the rate at which they loan out money, and the rate at which they pay the depositors. 
When Joey needs a loan to buy a car or start a pizza shop, today he can go to the bank and get the money he needs. Rest assured that if bitcoin does go mainstream, these same services will be offered -- they have to be offered in order for the economy to function -- except they will be offered in bitcoin instead of cash. It'll work a little differently because bitcoin is deflationary and cash is inflationary, but it'll still happen.

The $800,000 figure is based on a $75 trillion nominal asset pie, but keep in mind that the size of that pie is continually expanding as governments print more money, so a 13% stake might be worth far more in nominal terms in a few years from now.

That's actually not very much at all. Think what their costs must be each month to run their servers, offices, and pay their staff.

Why is it that you can't get USD out of MtGox in the USA, and why don't they make this clear in their terms of service? (It seems dishonest.)

This makes sense, but the implications are that the security of the network will ultimately be related to the transaction fees. 
How can we know that the transaction fees are high enough to ensure security?
Instead of capping the total BTC at 21 million, would it make more sense to have the currency continually inflating at something like XX% per year (paid to the miners), so that we can say that the cost to hijack the network is related to this rate of inflation?

Not really. Bitcoin as an underlying nominal asset offers durable deflationary storage like gold, and instant electronic transfer like credit cards or electronic wires. In effect it's a less cost to transact and more durable storage of wealth compared to cash or gold. So any bank services built on top of bitcoin will have to compete with those two characteristics (something banks currently don't do).

Eltacosbello -- the issue being raised is that if you follow the logic in my original post, the $1.7Bn can be expected to *decrease* over time, and will eventually be proportional to the transaction fees. There is no way to ensure the transaction fees are high enough to keep the cost of a 51% attack at $1.7Bn (or any other number as measured in either bitcoin or dollars).
