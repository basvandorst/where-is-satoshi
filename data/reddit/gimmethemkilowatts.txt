"18 months" is/was a meme answer for how long until Lightning Network is ready to be released.

If I save 10% of every paycheck into bitcoin, do you consider that constant demand or growth in demand over time?

Ripple owns more than half of all XRP which they created without energy expenditure, and they're constantly dumping it. On top of that, there are only a handful of nodes. It'd be easy to collude and create new XRP costlessly. Stock to Flow doesn't apply to stocks or bonds, either. It only applies to things which are costly to produce.
Stock to Flow _is_ predictive for Bitcoin. Using only 2009-2012 data is sufficient to [predict today's prices](
Great thread btw, I love the skepticism.

u/Bitcoin_Puzzler and I were thinking of "buy 10% every paycheck" as constant demand.
Even if Bitcoin does not attract any new savers, the existing community is sufficient to raise the price: constant new demand over time, with diminishing new supply over time.

When 1 sat = $1, one bitcoin will cost $100 million. I think we have time to deal with this problem. Besides, Lightning already allows spending fractions of sats.

Only in the sense that the price goes up and down. It's not spendable as bitcoin and it's not redeemable for real bitcoin. You have to sell it back for dollars first.
When buying bitcoin, best practice is to withdraw from the exchange after you purchase it, but Robinhood doesn't allow you to do that.

Don't promote the false idea that BTC will double in price almost immediately.
* First the block reward (the bulk of mining revenue) gets cut in half.
* Second, miners dump less BTC on the market because they have less to sell.
* Third, consistent new demand in the face of reduced new supply makes the price go up.
In the short-term, bitcoin's security against chain re-orgs will go down as total miner compensation goes down. But we're vastly overpaying for security right now anyway.
If/when the price eventually rises 2x or more, the total security will have increased.

Hmm. I feel rather safe from fraud and theft with my hardware wallet, although the technology does have a learning curve... my Grandma would have trouble figuring it out.
You can even buy "insurance" against the price going down by buying a put option on Bitmex, although I don't choose to do that.
Fiat does have some manner of protection from fraud and theft, depending on what sort of account you have (checking, credit, brokerage).
You make strong arguments in favor of real assets, but I don't think it's correct to categorically dismiss money as a savings instrument. Money is _liquid_. It gives you more flexibility than tying up your wealth in illiquid assets.
For instance, I'm currently renting instead of buying a home. Not only does this free up wealth I can invest elsewhere, but it's also simple for me to pack up and move. Buying a house is a lot easier than selling one, and I could choose to buy a house at any time.

Yes but hardware wallets like the Ledger and Trezor are designed to never reveal the private key. The computer asks the dongle to verify transactions, and it will only do so if you enter your PIN.
Hardware wallets are nice because they won't expose the key. In contrast, if you generate a private key yourself and use a computer to convert that into an address, your key is potentially compromised.
[Converting a key into an address]( is hard to do by hand, but could be done.
I think the best solution is a hardware wallet, with the seed words backed up on a cryptosteel.

I think you have it backwards. Inflation is when prices go up because the money is decreasing in value. That's when austerity and tight lending standards can help.

Yes but when people talk about "dollar inflation", they're talking about an increase in dollar-denominated prices. If you use the terms differently, we'll both get confused and talk past each other.
Dollar inflation = a weaker dollar. That's just how the term is used.


The USA had high inflation in the 70s, with  high demand for goods and a weakening dollar.
Currently we have low inflation (0.8% to 1.5%, below the 2% target).


The response to inflation is tightening the money supply, correct.

BerkeleyDB was used by bitcoin, yes. The difference is the UI. BerkeleyDB is a read/write key/value store, whereas bitcoin only lets you append data.
I understand the complaint that these private chains are not as immutable as bitcoin, but even bitcoin isn't perfectly immutable. It's like constant values in a programming language. There are lots of evil techniques for subverting constness guarantees, so it's not perfect. But it does help catch a lot of writes you didn't intend to make.
Databases can be used as a ledger, but they're not generally designed for append-only data; they update in-place. Furthermore you need a way to replicate the database to all participants. Blockchain's interface is much more aligned with these situations. Bitcoin is still my favorite asset, but there is room for more than one ledger in this world.

Incentivizing spending by disincentivizing saving has its own dangers. The vast majority of people live paycheck to paycheck and don't have enough savings for emergencies or a recession.
In a fractional reserve system like we have, deflation is dangerous because it encourages people to hoard cash. Everything starts running in reverse as people "cash out" of their loans and investments. That's why we target low and stable inflation.
There's nothing wrong with deflation in theory. It's our current system which is threatened by it.

What's funny is Vitalik proposed offloading data onto Bitcoin Cash to help scale Ethereum.
The reason this isn't a great idea is you become dependent on the other chain. Bitcoin has the most active nodes and the most widely distributed blockchain partly because it has emphasized small blocks, enabling weak computers to act as nodes. Ethereum is less distributed because it's so difficult and expensive to run a node. If Bitcoin depends on Ethereum's chain, then the collective system is not as distributed.

Non-segwit transactions are susceptible to malleability. It's not super dangerous as long as you don't get tricked and send funds twice.
Segwit transactions are immune to malleability, since they move the changeable part elsewhere and it's not included in the transaction hash. You can read more detail [here](

It looks like my figures were a little low, actually. Silver's stock to flow is around 22ish. Gold's is about 62 to 65. [Example random source]( The metals' stock-to-flow fluctuates because a high price incentivizes mining activity. Contrast with bitcoin which has a fixed issuance schedule.


Escaping government control is a reason _in favor_ of using crypto! As paper cash is phased out, governments will have unprecedented surveillance over financial transactions unless we switch to a decentralized crypto.
I wouldn't worry too much about access to the internet. Tor is rather easy to use. Check out [Orbot]( for Android; they have a nice and simple UI. There are also bitcoin [broadcast satellites]( and even bitcoin [over amateur radio](
At this point I don't think it's whether bitcoin will survive, so much as whether it can be stopped. Governments across the world would have to act in unison NOW. Even then, a single defector nation could keep bitcoin alive. At this scale I don't believe it can be shut down.
@_date: 2019-04-01 16:38:06
You must enjoy arguing if you've been up to this for six months! �� For what it's worth I do too. Even if you convince nobody, it helps sharpen your arguments. Since you seem open, here is my pitch.
Bitcoin has four rules that make it a great currency to hold:
1. No confiscations
2. No censorship
3. No supply inflation
4. Anyone can verify rules 1-3
Payment processors like PayPal and Visa are happy to shut down people's accounts when they do legal but controversial things. Even if none of the other rules were true, I would still want to own censorship-free digital currency.
But the real beauty of holding bitcoin is the scarcity, which leads to asset price appreciation. There is a concept called "stock to flow". Basically how much does the supply increase every year. Silver has a 20:1 stock to flow. Gold has 60:1. Bitcoin is currently around 27:1, but when the block reward halves next year (May 2020), it will be on par with gold.
Each new nugget of gold/silver/bitcoin that's mined is sold on the open market. You need saving activity to offset the supply being dumped, or the price will go down.
With a better stock-to-flow ratio, less supply is being mined and sold. Therefore the same saving activity can support a higher price.
Gold has a 3x better stock-to-flow than silver. All else being equal, that would mean a 3x higher price. However gold's superiority attracts much more saving activity, and it is actually 80x more valuable.
Bitcoin's stock-to-flow doubles every four years as the block reward is halved. This means the price will appreciate _even if we do not attract additional savers._ And of course a skyrocketing price always attracts new savers anyway.
[Stock-to-flow plot](
[Stock-to-flow price model](
Based on this model I anticipate a price over $55k in 2021, followed by a crash back to approximately $20k. But even if that does not happen, I feel secure in my holdings because of the four rules of bitcoin.

It goes deeper than that but I don't want to quote the whole article.
Suffice to say, the ratio between "all value held in cash" and "all value held in investments" is a measure of how dynamic and flexible the economy is in response to mistakes. When cash is low and people are fully invested, the economy is much less tolerant of shocks and errors.

Running a fully validating node is cheap and easy. With enough users running their own nodes, the power of miners is held in check. ASIC mining is decentralized enough.

That's not quite how compounding percentages work. Instead of 1 + (0.2 * 10), it should be 1.2 \^ 10.
20% growth per year is monstrously large.

Start with $100.
Grow 20% and you have $120.
Grow 20% again and you have $144 (not $140).
Grow 20% a third time and you have $172.8 (not $160).
The \^ symbol means "to the power of" and tells you how many times to multiply something by itself.
1.2 \^ 3 = 1.2 * 1.2 * 1.2 = 1.728
"Compounding" just means that each year's growth _also_ contributes to ongoing growth. Instead of just adding 20% of the original amount every year, it adds 20% of the _ongoing amount_.

This is no longer true, actually. China is buying oil from Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Iran with yuan. India is buying from Iran with rupees.

Once a transaction is forwarded to the global mempool, an individual miner might choose to censor it but another miner could include it. So it's difficult to censor transactions.
However, if you only expose your transaction to a miner you control, and _don't_ forward it to the global mempool, then no other miner even knows about it. That means you're the only one with a chance of mining it.

For comparison, bitcoin's annual inflation is 4% today and will be 0.0078% in 33 years (assuming no coins are lost).

LN aggregates lots of small transactions into large base-layer settlements.
It's sort of like keeping open a bar tab, then settling your bar tab at the end of the night. Except it's a whole network of bar tabs, and it's fully backed so there's no way to default.
Another way to think of it is turning the base layer transactions into shipping containers... large expensive blocks stuffed to the gills with smaller economic transactions.

As a counterexample, increase in the money supply does not necessarily lead to price/asset inflation if there is a corresponding growth in savings demand. This could come from population growth, foreign savings demand, or other factors.

It could be bitcoin laundering. Miner revenue looks "clean".
If you only expose the transaction to miners you control, you're guaranteed to be the one to collect the fee.

None of those examples name deflationary currencies, they name inflationary currencies which went through a deflation shock due to a surprise contraction of credit.

Tell me the danger of deflation.
- People are incentivized to save instead of spend. The horror! People will still buy what they need on a day-to-day basis.
- Debt gets harder to repay, true. Avoid taking on bitcoin-denominated debt.
Gold fluctuates but is marginally deflationary at times. The gold standard was in place from ~1800 to ~1930 and we saw huge growth in economic prosperity during that period.
The cult of 2% inflation is modern groupthink. It's such an arbitrary and dogmatic target.

If a savings asset growing in value is bad because people won't want to spend it, why don't we have the exact same problem with the stock market?
Why is it not "devastating to the economy" that people hoard S&amp;P shares instead of dollars or gold or what-have-you?
Those examples on Wikipedia all have to do with a surprise contraction of credit, which is quite a bit different than having a disinflationary currency like gold or bitcoin.
If disinflation/deflation is not a surprise, I see no reason why it has to be a terrible thing.

Altcoins cannot compete with bitcoin's scarcity and store-of-value narrative, so they are forced to compete with a medium-of-exchange narrative. High inflation incentivizes spending, which is a good thing in their mind.

In addition to the other causes posted, Bitmain and other large miners were spamming the mempool with cheap transactions.
It was an inexpensive gambit for them, because the transaction fees are paid to the miners (usually themselves), and it forced everyone else to pay more fees in order to cut ahead of the spam.

Well, it's one thing if you're talking about Ethereum or Monero. "Alts" to me conveys garbage like DeepBrainChain.

Just take a look at [coinmarketcap from a few years ago]( It's all garbage.
Peercoin, Omni, Nxt, Quark, Bitshares, Worldcoin, Primecoin, Feathercoin, Megacoin, Infinitecoin, Copperlark, Fedoracoin, BBQCoin... None of these are worth a damn today. I don't have high hopes for today's alts such as Dentacoin.
Litecoin and Dogecoin have survived. They're basically identical to Bitcoin and I'd rather own the real deal.
Ripple is still around. Not a fan of how centralized it is, nor their massive premine.
