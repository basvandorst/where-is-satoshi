Thanks, does it work with every bank and online payment methods like Payoneer and Paypal and can I buy with bitcoin in sites such as Ebay or Amazon?
I know those are a lot of questions but I'm just a beginner
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:29:25
Seriously what does it mean?
@_date: 2017-08-27 08:57:33
Two more questions: Should I wait a few more weeks/months so the bitcoin price drops and can I "cash-in" my bitcoin any time I want?
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:12:13
Awesome, thanks for the great advice. Which is the best bitcoin website or where should I buy bitcoins
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:29:38
Is there any other website that is as good as Bitstamp where I can create an account faster (Im not from US)

Thanks for pointing out that I'm a stupid idiot hahah
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:53:05
Thanks but I asked if I can but things with bitcoin online on sites like Amazon and not if I can buy bitcoins in Amazon hahah
Because I have seen some people say that you can buy online with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:36:53
I live currently in Kosovo, Albania where Paypal doesnt work. Would this cause a problem for bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-28 10:55:02
I know no one can guess it, but I asked if this happened before
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:15:58
Also do you know if the fiat to btc is the same amount as it should be (like Bitstamp) or does bitcoin cost more
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:09:22
thanks I will work something out :D I will try that subreddit
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:23:01
Thanks because people are selling btc atleast 5000$ rn on local bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:39:42
does coinbase require verifying?
also do you know how much they would charge for 120 dollars?
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:02:03
Do I need to create an account/get verified there? And can I buy coins online?
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:17:03
Yes thanks 
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:24:14

@_date: 2017-09-02 14:50:33

@_date: 2017-09-02 22:24:23
Thanks but What is a block exactly can you tell me if you dont mind because I keep seeing it get mentioned a lot here?
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:25:55

I might also buy other cryptocurrencies later on but first I'll invest in bitcoin
