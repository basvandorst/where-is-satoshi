risk is just one facet of investment.  some risky bets are very good.  say you could risk 1 penny, and 99% of the time you lose, but 1% of the time you win $1000

im not defending article.  just thought it was an interesting development to be aware of.

what about keepkey? 
my concern is that a hardware wallet could be a honeypot.  just a couple coders at one business need to sneak in malicious code.

The video posted in the article is of an interview with Netanyahu where he simply says the current deal with Iran is bad.  The curator of that site, who goes by the name SUNDANCE, offers up his own analysis.  Here is the relevant portion from SUNDANCE:
"In the background, and as a direct counter to how President Trump is using the Trump Doctrine of economic leverage, you will note that China, Russia, Iran and other state adversaries are creating a financial network to avoid their exposure to U.S. trade currency leverage.  Their strategic action is what’s driving up the value of crypto-currencies like Bitcoin as tools to avoid Trump’s leverage and Secretary Mnuchin’s aligned economic policy influence.
Follow this economic confrontation and subsequent financial avoidance technique to it’s natural conclusion – and what appears on the horizon is a financial system where the U.S. dollar is the currency of allies, and crypto-currencies are the currency of adversaries.
Europe will have to decide which direction to take; the International Monetary Fund and world banking institutions will have to decide whose side to take."

by that definition, everything is gambling, it's gambling when you cross a road whether you'll get hit or not.  it's all about making smart bets.
