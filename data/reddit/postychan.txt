I set it up with 12 word key and a pin number. Can this info be used to access my wallet through any other medium?

Just when I get back after clicking start the recovery and wait 10 minutes a message had shown that it was a success. But unfortunately the plot thickens. I will report on more of the details but basically the Bitcoin I thought was restored from attempting the 12 word recovery process to the new wallet still just showed a big fat 0. Hardly a successful recovery. Upon further investigation of the Coin Space forums and support site, I have become more and more convinced that this was all a scam from the beginning. ie Download and install the Coin Space wallet on your device, send Bitcoin to it for safekeeping and then is where it begins. I believe it was drained internally and the wallet was then made inaccessible from the app by the development team. How else could i suddenly be unable to access it in any way then in attempt to rescue the funds become aware that it was already too late, the trap was set and I got rekt. I will provide my findings that lead me to this frankly devistating conclusion.

I received an email from support. This is the latest. apparently all users are experiencing no access as well. Interesting since I hadn't a clue anyways I made a new thread linking to the twitter post.

I'll go ahead and start by googling BIP-39 to private key converter. Anyone know where will accept my private key string so I can get access to my wallet again?

I could really use an "like I'm 12" explaination. This wallet had half of my first 2-3 months paychecks since I started a construction job, ain't real smart.

U got it. Thankfully it's on the AUR or i'd have to switch to 3rd device lol.

again i feel more and more foolish... i must redact my statements against CoinSpace from previous post, I was not aware until I came across this news on twitter. Looks like they are working on restoring service by updating service nodes including BTC sync 86%, BCH 90%, ETH 89%, it has been slow due to alleged DDOSers... this update was current as of 4 hours ago.

In retrospect the reason I had considered a wallet on my phone for crypto was precisely to avoid having a third party involved with my btc after trading for it. Many people just purchase and sell from coinbase and that's it. But instead I believe i've been totally robbed by a group of thieves.
Avoid CoinSpace App and all the clone look alikes or you'll probably end up getting screwed. And I'd like to think that if nothing that people will share this until Google and apple start making it a bit harder to prey on their customers.
I mean the guy creating all the forums help pages is clearly fake and any review is fake and padded. I just didn't look hard enough and thought my I had control of my money and it wasn't on some server somewhere. 
Gotta work in the morning but I'll be back.

We did it family. Special shout out to u/fusionlds. Electrum had some issues with a python library so i went ahead and got it rolling with exodus. It told me all i needed was my 12 words and to type em in with a space in between and it looks like a success I'll know for sure in a few minutes. But I wasn't even sure this was possible. Thank you so much, really!
