If that's true, there are no appropriate precautions.  We would need an open hardware platform.  And i've even read of backdoors in linux &amp; bsd so opening it up wouldn't be a guarantee

I don't think bitcoin in its current form will work either (for the masses).. I like nubits and bitusd, theyre pegged to the dollar.  And platforms like mastercoin can peg to anything.  Nobody knows where it will lead, but i'm hopeful we'll have some good options in the future.

looks interesting; I don't have the tech background to critique it but others here do.  we may very well come up with some great ideas to get around the blockchain scaling issues.  that's the beauty of open source- we really have no idea how this will all play out- but we do know there are a lot of eyes &amp; minds working on it.

first of all, moores law will run into some pretty fundamental problems (for processing speed) within 10 years.  hard drive space is scaling pretty well currently.  bandwidth is limited not only by technology, but by politics, money, and corruption.  the US should have had gigabit internet years ago.
as for *bitcoin* adoption, I really don't think it will scale at the same predictable rate.  I think it will be much more sporadic, with boom-bust cycles, and s-curves that resemble last year's mining boom.  when people find out there's money in it for them, they'll flock to it like rabid wall street investors.
*so*, we have to be ready to support those manic transaction volumes *before* they happen.  otherwise we'll have more busts than booms.  sort of like the bubble in april 2013 when mt gox's trading engine crashed, screwing over thousands of people just with technology limitations. 
also, other cryptos may play important roles, and other systems can currently handle massive transaction volume.  there may be meta-layers that let you use any currency in the place of any other, without the user even knowing.  sort of like how the internet routes your packets the most efficient way, without you knowing.  so bitcoin itself may not have to store every cup of coffee ever sold.
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:51:43
Not suggesting bitcoin to hedge against bitcoin..  Just suggesting a stable non-fiat currency.  I'll look into those.  I think there's also an exchange that trades gold for bitcoin.
Problem is, everyone complains about bitcoin's volatility, as if it's the only crypto out there.  There are other options.
@_date: 2015-06-23 06:24:46
I say that we have no idea what block size we'll need at any given time.  Adoption will probably happen in sudden s-curves, like mining adoption.  we have to be ready for the top of the s-curve (not to mention any bad actors who want to flood the network) BEFORE any of it happens.  And if an unlimited hard block size is a problem, well, that's a fundamental design flaw.

Minimum wage hasn't increased at the same rate as inflation.  Wages in general have stagnated since the 80's while prices have skyrocketed.
And if you're fine living with massive inflation try going to zimbabwe or argentina.  Massive gov't breadlines, dealing in bricks of cash, prices changing by the hour, and like in the US, all the real value gets concentrated in the 1%.

You brought up an interesting point for a vote coin.  Once they can "spend" the votes they recieved on policies (hopefully the ones you like).  Would this somehow create a "deflationary democracy?"  A place where politicians are unable to run amok because they literally do have a limited amount of influence.
Also, i like the idea of using it just for votes, not as a speculative pump&amp;dump currency.  but Would anonymizing the blockchain really be able to accomplish that?

I think we're talking about 2 different things here, personal control vs institutional control.
when someone hacks your computer &amp; gets your private keys, they can do anything they want.
when someone hacks a centralized institution full of credit card info, they can do whatever they want to millions of people.
when someone hacks a centralized bitcoin exchange, same story.
when someone hacks a DEcentralized bitcoin exchange, all they get are public keys, so they can't do anything but give money to all those people.
so what makes bitcoin better than the current financial system is that it puts both the power &amp; the responsibility in the hands of the end user, not a centralized institution.  you do have to know how to protect your private keys, but it's way better than giving it all to some big company &amp; crossing your fingers they don't get hacked.

Might be good to focus (at least part of it) on the developing world..  topics like remittances, and the blatant corruption they have to put up with every day.  Andreas has already said that's his main focus for this year, as it's an iminent need that cryptos can help with.  They need sound money even more than us.  Once they adopt cryptos, they can provide a backing that will be stronger than first-world sentiment.  So even if the first world tries to ban or limit cryptos, they will still have a lot of backing from the developed world, which will keep the price (&amp; confidence) from tanking, which will provide leverage against such a ban.  A win-win for people everywhere, but it relies on developing world adoption.

bitcoin is secure because it doesn't create a honeypot of information in the first place.  the info is out there, but it's so much more spread out and each user has the ability to take substantial security measures if they choose.  if someone else gets robbed by being stupid, you still have your bitcoin.
with centralized institutions, there will always be a way to break into the honey pot, no matter how many chips &amp; pins are protecting you.  the larger the reward, the more incentive to break in.  that model will never be fully secure.  and it relies mostly on the actions of the centralized institution to protect you.  you just have to cross your fingers and hope they're not corrupt or incompetent.  and most of them are.

To a linear thinker with no vision for the future, it does seem "logically corrct".  To those who know the technology behind cryptocurrencies, it is so far beyond the legacy banking system that there's almost no comparison.  Maybe email vs snail mail.
Most of us " fanboys" know that bitcoin in its current state won't change the world or even rally back.  But other currencies will.  For every 1 problem with bitcoin, there are 10 other currencies that provide solutions.
Linear thinking says that the internet would be just another fax machine.

You can control what you do with your computer, in general, but you can't control every calculation.  Obviously some things point to criminal intent, but the question is where do we draw the line.  Especially since people aren't tech savvy enough to know exactly what their computer is doing.  Some of that "criminal intent" could just be due to a virus they picked up by accident.

There are some stable currencies, like nubits &amp; bitusd.  Theyre backed by nushares &amp; bitshares respectively.  If that model takes off, we will have stable cryptocurrencies, no need to use fiat.

"Bitcoin" probly won't ever see mass adoption.  After a few migrations towards more evolved protocols, we'll get it right and it will take off.  Nubits for example seems like a possible 2nd step.

Yep- that 1000 price was fueled by speculators who didn't know anything about it beyond a few bloomberg articles.  Now, theyre bailing 1 by 1, leaving the libertarians, fanboys &amp; true believers.

If you look at the market cap charts, *everything* is tanking, currently, except for nubits &amp; nushares.  I got into it when i saw on  bter that nubits had more volume than btc, that never happens.  I think that 1: the speculators are saying "fuck this" and 2: a new crypto model is being voted in, a model similar to the DAC (like bitshares).  It's a highly democratic model, relies heavily on user participation and awareness, but if it works it will set a new standard.

The "alternative" is pretty simple.  Just use altcoins.  There are hundreds to choose from, and a handful have a chance at mass adoption.  Don't be too lazy to download a 2nd blockchain.

If bitcoin ever gets real adoption, 100k transactions will be normal use.  Especially if micropayments take off.  Add to that a few rich people who may want to coordinate an attack, we could see transaction volumes FAR in excess of what even 20MB blocks can handle.  To keep it at 1MB is to stunt its growth arbitrarily.  
@_date: 2015-07-25 18:52:50
@_date: 2015-07-30 09:37:41
it won't even happen with 8MB blocks, if there's any real adoption in the next 2 years.  there will have to be some external payment channels.

@_date: 2015-09-15 10:28:25
I think it's all up to the community and the devs.
take linux for example- it runs a lot of servers on the internet, because it just works better.  the average user doesn't know what linux is or why it's important that it's open source.  they just know the internet works.
if linux had never been created, we would probably be paying tolls by the hour to the giant telecoms, and the internet would be slow &amp; shitty.  that was never realized, because the better, scalable, open-source solution was there pretty much from the start.
so I think that if the bitcoin community can provide the right solution, then people will use it as a backend without even realizing it.  people will still not care about privacy or security, even when they have it.  they will take it all for granted, like they do with the internet.
if, on the other hand, the centralized banks &amp; corporations make easy-to-use, scalable, spyware solutions, people will use those instead.  they will never know the difference, or how much better things could be with bitcoin.  they just don't care.

...and these are the people who actually *do* care, the ones who are living in opressive circumstances.  trouble is that many of them don't have access to the tech to use it, and once they do, they probably won't know how it works under the hood.  I think it's great that smartphones are making their way to the developed world, but i'm also worried that the spyware version will get to them first, and that will become "normal".  like zuckerberg's [internet.org]( project.
so again, it's up to the devs and the community to provide an open-source platform for not just remittances, but everything else too.
@_date: 2015-09-11 06:39:01

1- those who buy &amp; hold forever
2- bots
3- those who are trading with insider info
so I've realized that I'm just not a trader.  it sucks many hours out of your life, and even the best of them sell when they should've bought many times.  with btc going "to the moon!" (tm), I think it's a pretty safe bet to just buy &amp; hold.  if there's gonna be an obvious drop due to some big piece of news, then sell &amp; buy back at the bottom.  but as for day-to-day trollbox trading, it's just not for me.

do PT shares of asicminer count?  on btct.co they say that they aren't "real" and they aren't "assets".  But I'm getting out more btc than I put in, and btc has just been declared a currency.  But I bought the shares before that ruling.

it's a passthrough share.  It's not a "real" share, in that it doesn't give me voting rights.  I can just make or loose money with it.  They're easier to buy &amp; sell on exchanges, which is why they are used.  I haven't sold them yet, so I guess I could just hold for longer than a year, so the taxes will be lower.  if bitcoin is even legal a year from now.
or, I could convert it to a full share, which would be just an entry in one of friedcat's excel files AFAIK..  not sure if that's considered an "asset" either.  but the dividends are, as of a few days ago.

Is there a way i can look that up?  It just says pending.  
I'm new to trading in general..  so someone else has to agree to sell at that price, like a p2p transaction, and btc-e just mediates the transaction between you and them.  They're not like a bank where you can just dump your money &amp; make a trade later.  But when you buy or sell, they always give you the best current price, which corresponds to another trader who is willing to sell or buy at that price.  Am i correct in how that works?
If so, that means that a week ago i tried to buy from someone who was willing to sell at $84 each.  So did their transaction get stuck too?

@_date: 2013-10-29 18:37:25
it means that nobody else has put up an opposite trade (ask/bid) at that same price.  if you waited a few minutes before executing the trade, the going rate probably changed a little bit.  you have to release that order, then refresh the site and it will fill in the new current price.  execute it again and it should go through.  if it doesn't, then the price moved again, and if it gets annoying, just lowball yourself be a few pennies to get it done.
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:35:54
they probably would use local bitcoins &amp; cash.  it feels kind of like  a drug deal.. I have to keep telling myself "this is perfectly legal" as I hand cash to a stranger in a public place..

Thanks for the info.  I'm new (read: don't know what the hell i'm doing), so at least i'm making my mistakes on small trades instead of big ones.
There are 2 halves to the "buy btc" transaction.  The "buy btc" part shows up in current active trades, so i guess it didnt get filled.  The price was fluctuating a lot at the time, so it makes sense. 
The other half, "sell usd", shows up in my transaction history on the finances page.  So when i cancel the trade, i assume i get my usd back and both halves of the trade get cancelled?

circluation is important to the health of the economy, for bitcoin or any other currency.  dollars are being hoarded as well, in tax havens, and it's damaging the global economy.  I'm defining "hoarding" as "saving so much that noncirculation damages the economy".  
part of the problem is the exponential block creation built into the protocol.  by  the time most people had even heard of bitcoin, more than half of all currency had been mined, with some people keeping their stash out of circulation til the price explodes.
so obviously none of us has any real or legal obligation to put our coins in circulation, but if everybody holds on to everything they have, it turns from saving to hoarding.  and if a few people hold on to the 500,000+ that they mined since 2009, maybe only spending a few, that damages the economy so  I'm considering that hoarding.
