current transactions per week of what?...visa/master card,individual countries or currencies all will have a different sum
 u mention 1 tb a week and so how do they get that number lol  
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:38:14
not here
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:47:03
no one cares because its not a currency its a commodity if u pay premiums to use it 
HOOOODDDLLL TO THE MOOON
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:13:24
a whitepaper on LN to inform me fees are too high on core?? 
LN seems like it will fundamentally change bitcoin forever/fork
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:49:17
whats that based on US transactions or the worlds transactions in total? 
world is a stretch we have many different currencies i dont see the whole world using just 1 ever 
just seems the cost is low to create 1tb sd cards the markup on this shit must be enormous its so tiny i bet its way over the 1000% goal for manufacturing 
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:33:17
unbiased sub LOL ...sorry had to
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:25:34
this "explanation" looks longer than the whitepaper itself u must be shatoshi !
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:34:23
some people are trying to invest/make profit so for some people they think the MOOOOON yay imm gonna get rich for nothing.......
also u have people who wish to use these coins for exchange ...
silk road wasn't a store of wealth exchange people needed to buy and sell things and bought bitcoin to use as a system to make the exchange 
people who use it daily dont care that much about price because they make the exchange and its over... fiat in product bought usually within minutes and on with the day 
my favorite Chinese place bitched to me that the visa card company charged them over 700$ for a month just in fees to use they went to all cash....
they can now take crypto and when the coins hit the exchange wallet they can sell for fiat i think with autosell bot ... in this case they dont care about price at all...
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:35:11
i dont agree with him but Pokemon was out like what 20 years ago before go...go might be the LN
most just want something not controlled by banks so whatever coins those are will succeed 
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:04:39

who would accept this piece of gold for 50 bucks?
lets say we need to exchange this one day for goods its work itself to just use. seems to be a store of wealth and used as jewelry when has it been used daily for exchange of goods or as money for average people
 and do people really think its a safety net if cash fails lol?? the average person cant tell if its real or not or how pure it is... marked as if gold isn't soft and easy to "mark"
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:27:02
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:42:32
if the price of exchange is less than a bank it has a chance to replace a currency
 but as a multi use commodity as BTC basically stands now its use case is limited to almost nothing and very soon banks will overcome the fees and transfer fiasco 
the only thing holding banks back is a few signatures so it wont be long

u must report ALL transactions weather its a gain or loss or trade or a purchase...
if u put in say 100 then u dont pay tax untill u asume more than 100 in profit so no 10 from 100 is not taxed
110 spent than the 10 is taxed at what rate depends on various things go to a cpa....
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:13:08

what is economic experimentation and issued assets if not like a bank creating its own$$?????????
5.1.2 Economic experimentation
5.2 Issued assets?????
