 fees=mem pool you have a lot of hype and a lot of weak hands you're going to get high fees (lots of transactions).
 Lightening is already being developed and will make bcash/ripple obsolete comparatively (same capabilities, just Bitcoin instead of an ICO lol). 
 You want lower fees? develop it, and get rich. twiddling ur thumbs doesn't make you any wiser. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:58:29
Think again.
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:14:09
Lol you're  asking for advice on a anonymous forum. no alt coin can compete with Bitcoin once lightening is adapted, it has all the capabilities of any other alt but isn't a ICO.

Cash app and venmo are reversible good luck.
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:31:14
Cap gains doesn't make sense, just keep it forever fucker. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 06:10:10
Lol, Use the search feature key term "lightening" select within the week. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:38:38
Buy Bitcoin you'll be most protected as far as sell offs and market hold downs look at bitcoins recent history for an idea.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:38:58
You must pay taxes on every transaction doesn't matter what service you use.

It takes are 1 minute to send Bitcoin idk what world ur living in but ur supporting a printed coin blindness at its finest.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:26:36
Yes exactly that just like the 6500-19k that happened, and will happen again. Keep holding ripple and you'll be a victim to the banks.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:08:20
Bitcoin IS NOT A CURRENCY. Your missing the entire idea by a kilometer.

*redditor for 2 weeks 
Sorry to rain on ur parade but ur sarcasm tells me I'm probably more correct than you like :)
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:23:29
Then quit, we're just beginning. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:34:06
New coins being created at will* I don't want to enter a competition that can be bought son. instead of promoting a clear scam, why not focus on what makes Bitcoin go to 19k? Futures. same people who created ripple are the same people creating uncertainty in btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:41:22
Be ready for a confusing couple weeks / months. the ones who bare the storm will reap the benefits. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:19:05
 Yes, probably speaking from experience haha. I remember buying at 250 and selling at 225 cause I was scared of a loss, now I've learned to never put all my eggs in one basket. 
 I'm not as nearly as scared of dips even when we're talking 3-4K swings I always think back to $25 being a lot. Game is still the same just more players. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:29:22
Bitcoin has proven countless times it can be affected by manipulation but never broken. The trusting of a third parties morals when it comes to decentralization is like trusting a a street beggar isn't going to buy crack with your money. If it isn't decentralized at first it won't ever be.  
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:50:54
Why does Bitcoin have to compete with centralized coins that can be printed at will? If you really believe that, ur delusional as the people buying ripple at $2 all hype 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:22:10
Keep panic selling, lmao. I love some good ole volatility to scare the newbies always a learning lesson when u miss out on a huge upward correction. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:29:51
Taxes, bills, etc people are either cashing out Bitcoin because of volatility and or wanting cash in hand, it's okay tho they always come back and buy at ATH. :)
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:22:44
Welcome to Bitcoin this guy gets it lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:55:57
Well when cash was loaned to people who couldn't afford their loans we just printed more (ripple) Bitcoin refuses and will loose value to not suffer the same fate and for that I don't plan on cashing out in the next decade.

*7 week old account. Get some skin in the game jimmy, get off Reddit. You got a couple years to grow aswell!

Anything great and built to LAST will have evolutionary processes, it is the sole reason we are still here today. Suppose Bitcoin wasn't 'cheap and fast' in the beginning it wouldn't of caught on and been so adopted, now we're entering a phase of highs and the transaction fees must adapt or Bitcoin in itself will fail. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:25:21
Double whammy so to speak, we're entering a time of big players causing doubt and uncertainty. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:42:45
You're delusional if you think investing in a "soon to be decentralized" coin is smart. this is a banksters trick, hook line and sinker they've got your trust, Why ? Greed. I hope you already sold cause it's going to be a rough ride.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:54:56
Pre mined lmfao this is a fucking joke right? U want to invest into something that can be created at will?  The entire point Bitcoin is avoiding exactly that.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:47:03
You're talking out of ur ass champ, no basis in this other than "THE EXPERTS SAY" same experts that currently manipulate the us economy? I think so.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:09:38
You simply cannot compare a centralized coin to a decentralized coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:28:22
Btc doesn't need to improve anything why? Consistency, what lite coin ripple and all the others can never replicate. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:39:42
The only argument you've presented is centralized vs decentralized and that's a lost cause if you haven't figured that out yet. What if I told you the transaction fees you think are "killing" Bitcoin are actually saving it ?
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:27:00
Looks like ripple did its job, they'll be back after the crash (not like we really need them back)
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:20:51
If it goes to 6k I'll eat my dick.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:03:18
But you're trusting a centralized entity just like we trust the fed see a vital flaw in that?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:41:46
Still doesn't change my assertion lol but keep focusing on ur nee account u got a lot to learn :)
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:57:40
Look man you're probably going to see some terrible things in the next month or so but always remember it must rain before it shines.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:47:26
Great supporting argument, I think I found the child :)
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:43:08
What if I told you transaction fees you think are 'killing Bitcoin" are actually saving it ? A sort of inflationary guard if you will ? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:28:58
You're investing like a child I'll talk to you like one lmao.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:45:23
Transaction fees safe guard inflation, the exact scenario Bitcoin is facing why? when you can't attack something head on, you just discredit it (ripple/litecoin).
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:38:14
Read the white paper if you're inconclusive, I can only give a 'biased' view, but I'm a pretty pragmatic and logical person I'd like to think and I can tell you this;
Bitcoin is a finite resource 
The first solution to peer2peer anonymity with money (still not a currency but I'm sure someone will accept gold for a house)
Ease of use: meaning I can be at any place at any time and send anyone any amount of coin (related to dollar value) and you can trust this is good as gold.
Monopolized; most if not all alt coins are bought first with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:53:41
Okay give it some thought; if you knew you had to pay large fees to move money would
You consider saving it rather than selling ? And how would this affect the market on a large scale. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:28:13
Sell sell sell 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:39:06
Don't fall into their hands trading gold for a centralized currency is not smart in my mind. Short term gains in Alts are nice just don't loose ur ass.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:38:23
Whatever ur heart desires it's worth 13k usd comparatively but can be used for anything.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:21:51
Commodity like fish, tomatoes, and gold. You're basically investing in the production when u invest in a commodity. Bitcoin is a finite resource great investment but it's platform and basis is ripe for manipulation in the short term, but long term anyone with a brain hedges their bet on Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:44:09
I agreed but your fighting a battle that's unwinnable
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:51:25
You'll always have peer to peer. Not negating ur argument but in my mind I wouldn't trust any middle man when moving large sums. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:17:15
