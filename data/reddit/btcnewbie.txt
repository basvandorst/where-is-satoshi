Thank you!

Thanks. I should read more on this.

So Blockchain.info's seed actually works? what other wallets you suggest for this? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:21:28
I think I just figured what happened here. the chart I am looking at have a limit of 500 MB and basically doesn't display the increase, right?
Checking the large mempool BTC chart I can see the increase in dark blue bar too.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:00:45
I am confused right now. I think I know what the chart is displaying. looking at the one-week view, it seems nothing is happening to transactions with lower than 70+, but transaction with lower than 1+ fees got cleared sooner than those with 2 to 70 fees... am I right?
Also what does this means: "This server has a mempool limit of 500 MB (corresponding to 170-200 MB in the third diagram)."
What is the difference between BTC chart and large mempool BTC chart?
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:28:11
Or maybe not...
On the large mempool chart, moving my mouse from Dec 15 20:58 to Dec 20 8:32, I see an almost straight dark blue 1+ bar. but the tx number increases from 147,572 to 217,271.
Shouldn't the bars increase in size when there are more pending tx?
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:18:06
Sorry, I forgot I can mention times!


Actually I am referring to what happened from 25 Dec 9:00 to today. what happened to the dark blue 1+ bar?
At 25 Dec 9:52 there are 131,100 tx with 1+ fee. right?
At 25 Dec 21:15 tx number **increases** to 142,460. but the dark blue bar dropped... why?
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:05:50
Thanks, that was helpful. but why at some point 1+ line got cleared faster than 2 to 70 fees?

Is sarcasm available in Europe?

So that's what Lightning Network looks like!

How does an airgapped/offline Electrum restores/generates xpriv/private keys from the seed without internet connection?
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:11:23
It depends on your current wallet... what do you have?
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:46:06
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:00:24
* Good news: By having your seed and private keys, you now own your bitcoins.
* Again, good news: Without having your password, it would be hard to spend and you will Hodl your bitcoins.
* Bad news: If you don't know your password, you have to restore from seed and probably pay another transaction fee. but only if you wish to spend or trade.
Electrum is good. you can compare other wallets here:  look for those which say "Control over your money "

Hmm why last time it was said not make transactions when close to a fork?
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:42:04
What do you mean? no SegWit transaction and addresses for those who use cold storage?
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:22:28
Or on an official Twitter profile with several newbie followers like myself...
@_date: 2017-09-26 07:48:10
See my question. I need software wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:44:01
Come on. really?
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:25:17
What if I don't make any transactions until it is all clear?
This is a problem with every wallet I know. Electrum, another seemingly good choice, forced users to use Electron Cash to retrieve their BCC and they have not released its segwit version yet.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:35:53
For the settings only, it seems. I couldn't find the costs.

How do they benefit from this that enables them to have tech support?
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:46:49
Thank you, I will check it.
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:26:26
It uses a BitPay service, Bitcore Wallet Service (BWS) for peer synchronization and network interfacing. that's why there are risks for making transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:41:50
Thanks for allowing me to use your address and keeping my 1000 bitcoins for me.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:52:30
Do I need to download that 150GB only when accepting transactions from others? I mean do I still have to download whole blockchain to verify anything if I am sending/receiving bitcoin to/from myself?
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:40:19
No, I am asking for myself, I have 1000 bitcoins and yet I am so newbie I am running around asking dumb questions :/
Wait. or maybe it was just a dream...
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:12:23
How much data should be downloaded for each sync?
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:46:58
Last time it was said not make transactions when close to a fork. this fork is launching without reply protection. are there any risks if I am transferring coins between my own wallets?
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:46:52
I am sure bitcoincore is the safest option. but not a good one for normal users. I wish they could make an SPV wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:09:23
What is the minimum CPU required? [bitcoin.org]( hasn't mentioned anything about this.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:09:22


Now I get why Lopp suggested Raspberry Pi or Bitseed for those who don't have an always online machine... and those two should always online too, correct?
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:18:46
Okay. let me see if I got right. this 150GB is archive of all old transactions and I only need to download it once and after that if I cannot keep my node online, how much data should be downloaded for each sync?
