The Chinese exchanges have 0% fees, so this assertion isn't a great help for you to answer your question. One person with 1 bitcoin could trade it a million times to add 1 million BTC to the trade volume on the exchange.
Does any exchange publish its total reserves? That's what you need to find out.
Look at the exchange order books and add up all the open orders. Maybe that would help.
It is an interesting question. Thanks for posting it.

It seems like sometimes you're saying this is all about Western Union, but then you claim Western Union isn't relevant. 
Which one is it? 
Why are you so obsessed with upvotes and downvotes, by the way? Relax. You could just edit your own original post to add the missing information about Western Union, if that concerns you so much.

That's a great point, thank you. Though if we accept this as true, does it let HSBC off the hook? 
To maintain their position, they either committed a 'crime' or they acquiesced in an enormous perversion of justice. They're either a hypocritical money launderer, or a hypocritical facilitator of the unjust and broken AML system. I think they're both.

I'm sorry, but you're barely making sense anymore. You've also repeatedly avoided most of the questions I've been asking from the beginning
You still haven't provided the Western Union figures that you claim you compared with the Remitly figures. Sorry, but I no longer believe you have any such figures for Western Union, this is the only conclusion I can draw from your reluctance to share them immediately.
By your own admission, you haven't even bothered to find out whether the Remitly figures are correct, and you don't even seem to know where they came from. So why did you waste everyone's time by posting them here and demanding that people had to beat them? 
Please answer all the questions, not just part of them.

From the same site, ironically:
[HSBC to pay $1.9bn in US money laundering penalties](
In that case, HSBC got fined for ignoring $700 BILLION of transfers that included billions in laundered drug cartel money. The size of the GABI fund which HSBC just cut links to is only about $200 million, so the whole fund is smaller than one of the fines HSBC got for money laundering. 
Isn't it good to hear that HSBC has cleaned up their act by kicking out investment funds. I'm sure we won't be hearing about any more fines for HSBC in future then. The latest [money laundering charge]( HSBC got two weeks ago will be the last, for sure.

So, in your own words: All you want to show here is that the spoof bitcoin ads vs Western Union ads were wrong, *but*, this thread actually has nothing to do with Western Union. 




And since you know remitly.com is cheaper than WU, then you obviously know what Western Union costs, or how could you compare them?
So, you also have hard evidence that Western Union is better than Bitcoin, but you don't want to share it with us. Instead, you chose a different remittance company for the comparison. 
Okay. Anything else?

This comment is really fucking ironic coming from someone whose stubbornly laissez-faire approach to moderation has turned this subreddit (and bitcointalk) into a endless war between moronic anti-bitcoin trolls and equally moronic pro-bitcoin shills - a policy which inevitably drives away most of the intelligent and productive members of the community and continues the downward spiral.
@_date: 2014-11-26 13:48:26


I'm sorry you feel like that. 
I just wondered why you were concealing the calculations that you obviously had about Western Union. 
I mean, your original post is responding to that anti-Western Union circlejerk, according to its very first sentence. So it seems very strange that you didn't simply share the information you already had about WU, right from the start, don't you think?
The thought occurred to me that you were maybe concealing that relevant information because it makes your argument look much weaker. Perhaps I'm being too hard on you? Maybe you just got overexcited and forgot about it.
Like you, I just want to make people think a little bit harder about the crap they're talking. I hope you don't find that offensive.

Your bot can post and update a comment, so it's known if someone promises a game but doesn't pay for it. Updating the original comment is better than posting a new message.
If you add the status to the end of the bot's comment and update it, I suggest 4 sorts of status.
Status: Gift pending, not yet paid
Status: Gift paid, but not yet accepted
Status: Gift Accepted!
Status: Cancelled (The order still wasn't paid for after 24 hours)

Thanks for taking the time to type that. I did understand you already, though.
You're claiming that if Bitcoin can't offer better prices than 99.6% of the market then it has failed. The fact that Bitcoin is already beating 99.5% of the market in your test is not good enough for you.
The problem with this argument is that, in your example, Amazon.com and Overstock.com are charging higher prices, but they are actually doing fine (like Western Union in the Phillipines). They have a much higher market share than momnpop.com. *Companies do not have to be in the top 99.5% of the market to thrive.*
That is why cherry picking a company with a tiny market share and demanding that Bitcoin had to beat it was a *terrible* idea. It made your entire challenge look ridiculous.

You're being too kind to him.
It starts right from the title, which ignores off-chain transactions.
That is particularly notable because he pompously lectures you, the contributor of his data, in his comment at the end:
"So what happens with fiat is that almost all of it is essentially deposited (saved) in banks who then relend it out creating circulation."
Off-chain transactions are comparable to relending here (because they conceal real financial activity). But he chooses to ignore off-chain activity in his own title, while using relending to try to refute your argument.
Not to mention all those concrete-sounding "conclusions" he reaches, while unashamedly admitting that he lacks even the most basic data about Bitcoin: such as the volume of "valid" transactions, and "what value is actually being transmitted"
In the absence of such data, most of his so-called "conclusions" would be more honestly described as "guesses" and "assumptions". And the fact that the data is not easily available is not an excuse for this kind of arrogant overreach.

As you said, you made the rules here. It was you who wanted this challenge and posted it repeatedly. You were demanding that other people participate, and complaining when they refused. 
So why do you get so upset and defensive when you're asked to explain your strange behavior with the numbers you provided?
Remitly's market share in the Philippines? 0.4% 
You claim you were "trying to be VERY fair to bitcoin" but you actually ignored 99.6% of the remittance market, including the largest company, Western Union, even though you already had the numbers for Western Union.

On Bitstamp, it would take about $13 million. The market doesn't have much depth. You have to get your sales in very quick, though!

You haven't answered the question.
You posted many times about Western Union before. The comments in that screenshot are just a small sample. Therefore you must know a lot about Western Union, If you don't know, then why are you acting as if you do? You never even mentioned any other remittance companies before. 
This whole affair has been focused on Western Union, because it dominates the remittance market.
From your own comments, you appear to know a lot about Western Union and Bitcoin, so why are you not using using Western Union as your example in this challenge? Why waste your time to research a totally different remittance company?
If Western Union is better than Bitcoin, then why won't you use it as your example here?
If Western Union is not better than Bitcoin, then why were you defending Western Union and criticizing Bitcoin before?
@_date: 2014-11-26 08:45:02
Why is it that you suddenly stopped defending Western Union?
For hours, you were arguing that Western Union was obviously better than Bitcoin, and you produced lots of figures to support yourself. I can see that from your last [24]( hours of posts.
So, you already did extensive research about Western Union, obviously. Is that correct?
Surely you already had convincing evidence that Western Union was better than Bitcoin, or you would not have made those comments before? Is that right?
But now, you've suddenly shut up about Western Union and switched to talking about other remittance companies. 
Even though you appeared to be an expert on Western Union's charges, the example you've chosen to prove your point is a totally different remittance company. 
Were your previous claims about Western Union truthful and accurate? 
If they were, then why are you not quoting them here? 
If they weren't, then why did you make those comments?
edit: tl;dr In this thread, Frankeh eventually reveals that Western Union is slower and more expensive than Bitcoin, and he knew this all along. I guess that's why he stopped talking about Western Union when he had to provide hard data. 
I pointed out that Remitly, the company that Frankeh cherry-picked to compare Bitcoin to, only has about 0.02% of the remittance market. 
He explained that I was a "cunt" who was "shitting up his thread" and he refused to answer any other questions.
@_date: 2014-11-26 18:07:36
It turned out to be neither


@_date: 2014-11-26 12:39:24
Thanks for finally providing the data.
So, based on the data you yourself had available all along, but refused to reveal, Western Union offers a slower, and more expensive remittance service than Bitcoin, even for the countries that you yourself choose as your example.
Which, in fact, was the point of the circlejerk that you were talking about in the first line of your post.
@_date: 2014-12-01 17:02:02
More cautious? I'm sure they'll be more cautious about hiding the money laundering in future. But more cautious about avoiding it? I doubt they will be.

So, what you're saying is that you already had proof that Western Union was cheaper than Bitcoin, but you decided to ignore that and go and find better proof? OK, gotcha.

Because you're ignoring 99.98% of the Remittance service industry that Bitcoin is competing with. You don't know that? 
You can ignore them, but their millions of customers obviously don't. So of course, they are relevant. It is a free market, like you said.
In the $500 billion remittance market, Western Union has almost 20% market share. The service that you've chosen, Remitly, only has 0.02%.
