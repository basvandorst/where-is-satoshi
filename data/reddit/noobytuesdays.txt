19 hours at the same price is enough to go to bed, wake up and come back home...

Enjoying watching Bitcoin slowly tip toe away while many of people on the BitcoinMarkets thread are standing on the sideline waiting to haul in a load bitcoin, priced at either 2K or 3K.  Then again, I am a noob, what do I know?  I was all in on the 31st, so I have at least put my money where my noob mouth is :-)  See you all on the moon (or in goblintown).

Hey everyone!  Just got home and noticed that Bitcoin has flatlined all day (since I went to bed).  If someone could get some AED shock paddles and revive Bitcoin, that would be great!

By late Fall, whether we have "hit the bottom" or not by now is going to be looked at and seem so silly... even if it goes to 3k or 4k... it will bounce and the phoenix will rise again.  I suspect we have nowhere to go but up because of the support the 6K's have shown.  Bitcoin has always been a currency for believers... Christ rose from the dead while the masses walked away.  Bitcoin will rise again, while the day traders are walking away.  Hodlers and Whales will always swim together.
