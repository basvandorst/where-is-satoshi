I've only recently started accepting Bitcoin and think the response has been great. Spreading the word to existing businesses that it can be as simple as just another way to get paid would, in my newb opinion, build value.

Thanks, it's much appreciated :)

First order in Bitcoin came in the day after accepting it on the website. Just a note to other businesses out there considering it, give it a try!

Thanks for flagging this. The current store host is not customisable at present, unfortunately. I wanted to provide a simple click and order tool, but see that it is an imperfect solution. I will investigate. 
If you want to select some items from the store and email the order to info we can process the order through email with only Bitcoin. 
I hope this is a workable interim solution. If not, please let me know!

I think(!), I have a working solution. I've added Bit Pay buttons on a dedicate BitCoin Page, for each of the products in my store. 
It's not pretty, but if it works, I can get some help with the HTML to make it look nicer. 
Thanks,

Thanks for suggesting these! I'll investigate and will update with how I get on.

I've duplicated the store catalogue - not pretty, but if it works I'll get some help with the code to make it look nicer. 
Thanks,

Hi, 
Thanks for that. I've added comments into the payments and FAQ section as suggested. I'm looking at the cart and checkout pages now, but am going cautiously in fear of breaking something!  Thanks again.
