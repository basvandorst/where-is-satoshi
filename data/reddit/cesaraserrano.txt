I did a bit a googling and noticed that recent forums are spending 1200USD for their mining tools. My opinion is just to treat it like a stock, and avoid buying anything with an insecure currency :/

calculated earnings are just a probability that will appear more accurate with time. There are still highs and lows. Though i think 5$/week is high, seeing as that is currently ~1btc/year. More miners will cause the difficulty to attain anything to increase. No power caps have been noticed, yet, but soon enough someone will want to control any success.
Hope this gives you piece-of-mind :)

What dafuq is this irrelevant comment?

Do you think greed is a natural trait in everyone, or is it molded by society.
You have blown my mind, and I thank you for sharing this link.

Thank you for the solid portal to credible info.

Does the fact that it is a decentralized currency not change that, because I'm thinking it would be incredibly difficult to audit.

Have you considered that companies would rather deal with currency that is more controllable by the government in order to stay under the radar of that government?

What scrutiny does cash get?

You sound far too righteous about this to take you seriously.

I've been informed that regardless of the manner in which you are paid, tax departments still have it covered. I appreciate the response.

I'm 17 and it took me a week to learn all this. So don't be discouraged, and P.S. Mt gox is your friend, check out their AMA

Not worried about my surroundings. Why do you offer this advice without warrant? Do you know something I don't know...are you an emotion lord (just re-watched bravest warriors)

O_O is your username your birth year?

People enjoy less controlling presence.

I appreciate the information. I will now continue happily believing there is no way to evade.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:23:51
it seems you're very invested, i dont know much about processors,so i can't help you there, it all seems untrustworthy. Has anything like this happened before? If so, then how did it end, is what I'm wondering mainly now.

I believe miners will be less than honest with how much income they produce. Then this will cause bitcoins to be less acceptable.

Too many pronouns, afraid of miscommunication, could you be more explicit please? 
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:54:33
any advice for hesitant "bandwagoneers"?
@_date: 2013-04-27 11:19:03
I see, and I now agree. That's a good point, it is incredibly easy to accept bitcoin.
