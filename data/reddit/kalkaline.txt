I could have worked hard in middle school, gotten into a better high school, and eventually go to Harvard and partner with Zuckerberg to make Facebook and been so much richer than anyone with Bitcoin.

Right, my grocery store doesn't accept them, my gas station doesn't accept them, I can't buy lunch with them, oh but at this one place online I can use them. They're gift cards.

So put it on the public ledger for the world to see, brilliant!

I don't know a single vendor that I use that will take bitcoins, dogecoins, litecoins, or any other e-currency.  I don't understand the talk of these currencies being legitimate.  They are glorified gift cards at the moment.

People always say gold, but I think some solar panels, water storage, and some filtering and water treatment would be way more valuable.

Yeah, what do people not understand about a public ledger?

Just wait until they find out about the crime rings run by the US Dollar.
@_date: 2019-08-12 02:27:29
Yeah, at that point there is no trading Bitcoin because there is no electricity.  Bitcoin requires some basics of society to function.

Happy for all of you who are in the black right now.  It's entertaining to watch from the sidelines.

If you have all your savings in Bitcoin and it turns out to be a speculative bubble that pops overnight and you can't sell Bitcoin because no one is buying, your savings is gone.  If OP is working and able to pay all his bills and has emergency savings and retirement savings going, and isn't facing a ton of debt out of college, and has money left over after all of that, sure invest in BTC if you can afford it and are ok with the risk involved.

Everyone on the internet is a macroeconomics 101 student, I swear.  Everyone always talks about economics like they can predict market fluctuations, while any good economist will tell you they have no clue what's going to happen tomorrow because they aren't a psychic.

 Dave Ramsey said don't buy at $750

There is no reason a competing platform couldn't take a larger portion of the market share.  Bitcoin has a pretty good reputation for being secure, the brand is solid, it's somewhat widely distributed, people are using it.  That could all be undercut by a company with infrastructure in place like Visa, MasterCard, Square, American Express, or other companies that already have readers at gas stations, convenience stores, grocery stores etc.  
 
When my employer starts accepting Bitcoin as payment, and starts offering Bitcoin for wages, I'll be excited about Bitcoin hitting 100k and beyond.

Honestly if you are running out of cash in a Monopoly game, you are probably playing a bad strategy.  Take away the other players' chance at building hotels by keeping 4 houses on all your Monopoly properties.

I remember it hitting $200 and everyone was calling it a bubble that was about to pop, then not long ago it hit $2000 and again everyone said it was a bubble.  I could pop the bubble and buy some, but it's too fun to watch this craziness.

I pick losers when I pick individual investments, BLDP in early 2000 was because I finally gave in and bought the hype.

It's like the market is so complex, no one can accurately predict what it's going to do and when it's going to do it.

Post the rollercoaster meme, that always gets things moving.

Weird that people with 6 week old accounts all start parroting the same point within minutes of each other to counter my point.

Deflation and stagflation has it's drawbacks.  Why would you buy something like a new car today, when you know you can buy it for cheaper or the same price tomorrow?  Too much inflation and no one wants to lend money because they'll lose value on the payback.  You want a moderate 2-3% inflation year over year and wages to keep up and mostly full employment. Right now we have inflation at 2-3% and full employment, we just need wages to catch up.

Most everyone who wants a job has one, maybe they are a bit underemployed, but official numbers look pretty good.

But my local grocery store doesn't accept any of those.  They take US currency in paper, coin, and electronic forms.  Also, my employer doesn't pay me in pants.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:16:51
I have yet to find a grocery store around me that accepts Bitcoins.  When that day finally comes, I may consider the jump.
