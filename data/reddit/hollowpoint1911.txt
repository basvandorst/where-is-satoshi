BFL would have been served if it was a judgement by default. A party in that position probably has 20+ excuses to not show up, the most likely I would guess would be related to lack of funds for legal defense. I could imagine that settlement of $12.5k getting sent to a collections agent on behalf of and then who knows if it gets paid (partial or entirety) at all.

I think you're stretching a bit when you say they are "consider[ing] accepting bitcoin". You got the vague and generic response so it appears like they care.
They are a great store, but I doubt a vendor that big would take the chance on stirring things up and accepting bitcoin.

Drove by today and the billboard is still up. It stands up there in company with another billboard for a strip club as well - boobs and bitcoin.

Is it possible to spin that box around on thick pile carpet any more than he did?

Damn, I noticed this over the weekend. I should have stopped in traffic to take a picture of it and steal the thunder!

Would be great to have him not sign this bill and the others relating to firearms rights in California.
This will be a horrible year for firearms rights in California with pending bills and at the current pace, will start to get bad for us involved with crypto currencies as well.

I believe so when I passed it up last weekend. I'll drive by tomorrow and check again.

I pass by that billboard every couple days while driving on Lawrence Expressway.
