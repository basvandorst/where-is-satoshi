Yes it is. what is the maket cap off Bitcoin right now?  Now pretends there's only 1 Bitcoin to split up to all of the current users.  That 1btc would be worth whatever all of btc is worth now.

Quit using coinbase ��.

Cool I'd heard about this one already, but still have that safety question.  Is it safe to plug that usb in?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:26:03
I'm in the same situation as this guy, keys stored on thumb drive,  I wanna pull the cash out and put the BTC on a trezor.  Does coinomi exsist for Windows? Is it safe to even plug my USB into a computer?? I'm generally paranoid and scared I'm gonna fuck up.

No this is Bitcoin.

I remember toning the dip perfectly but coinbase fucking me so I didn't get in until like 3400

Keep dipping, I'm in for the long haul.  Hell I'm afraid I'd sell out if it got too high again and be telling my grandkids how rich I coulda been if I didn't sell at 100k.

I agree, just a tiny lil issue.

I think moving to Satoshi pricing alone would help crypto be accepted, it's a problem not many people saw in the beginning.

Bashful? Basherful.  .. k I'm done
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:38:41
but isnt ethereum mined with gpu's vs. asics? making their mining easier to get into (more miners?)     im probably wrong on that assumption.

It's nice to see this as a discussion and not as a Bitcoin bash like over on btc.  What is the consensus on this among the core devs?  I suppose bigger blocks= less profitablity for miners, less profitablity for miners means less miners, = longer wait times and higher fees anyways... This shit is complicated, I'm glad we don't make changes all willy nilly.   I'm pretty new to all of this so who wants to yell at me about what I'm wrong on?

Sell Bitcoin at 18k

If I try to sell you monero under the guise it's Bitcoin because I think it is true to the original is that ok?

I could see 1850 or whatever that level of support was.  After that average Joe's start buying again.  I just wonder if average Joe holds up price or not.
