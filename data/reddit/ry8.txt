I finally have my BCC in a wallet!
I used Co-Pay which doesn't support BCC. This should work for anyone who has their 12 word BIP39 Mnemonic recovery phrase.
You can use this open source online tool: 
Download, save it, and turn off your internet if you're worried about someone stealing your BCC.
Put your 12 word phrase into "BIP39 Mnemonic".
Copy your public receive address from your current wallet and search for it on the page.
Two columns over from that address in the same row in a column called "Private Key" is your secret key that will unlock your Bitcoin Cash.
Download, install, and run Bitcoin ABC from: 
Hit hide and proceed to the Help menu, and pick "Debug window".
In the debug window type importprivkey(…) with your key from the step above instead of the dots.
Wait for the progress bar to get to the end, and the debug window will say null, which is good and means no errors have occurred.
Now just wait for Bitcoin ABC to fully synchronize with the network and your balance will show up. This may take many hours.
I did this on OSX, but it should apply on Windows and Linux too. Hope this helps you as much as it did me!

Anyone want to buy my Bit Gold ? I’ll trade you one BG for one BTC. Seems fair I think.

I am not Satoshi Nakamoto... I’m his son, Ethereum Notabitcoin.

So many jokes today. Gotta stop reading Reddit for today.

Obviously a shill study funded by the big banks!
