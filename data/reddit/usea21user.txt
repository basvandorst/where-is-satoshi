Substantiate your claim. On r/btc people made a regular effort of getting people to read the satoshi's whitepaper, highlighting on the on-chain scaling. Here I see mainly emotional pleas to ignore bitcoin's history so 3rd parties can implement their private scheme.
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:26:22
This sub is winning hearts and minds. UASF is malicous.
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:58:24
But he/she/it is correct.
@_date: 2017-05-29 10:14:47


I then post a link to a user making a personal attack on Jihan.
You reply by changing your tune:


@_date: 2017-05-29 10:55:29
When you can detail how Lightning network is bitcoin itself maybe the discussion can move forward. Until then all you have is denials and insults. 
Remember: You can use a car but do not become the car itself through it's use. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 10:41:08


Substantiate your claim.
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:57:19
Substantiate the claim. I'll be waiting.
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:35:15
Legacy chain == Bitcoin
UASF == Corecoin
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:38:58
The personal attacks on here are out of control.
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:56:28
So prove it. Insinuations don't mean a thing unless we are talking about how they reflect on the person making them.
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:01:01
The UASF/BIP148 solution: 
Call a hard fork a soft fork and threaten to kill bitcoin's usability outright by scaring people into adopting it.
Also accusing people of incest like kryptomancer here did earlier to a UASF opposer: 


Classic UASF supporter tactics. Real anti-bitcoin activity.
@_date: 2017-05-29 10:19:19


Freight train, lol.
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:32:49
I guess you guys really want to be an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:11:01
I'm guessing no one taught you that forwarding people's incivility and projecting it out onto others does no good? This should be apparent now.
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:46:28


@_date: 2017-05-29 10:51:08
So basically you have no valid refutation and choose insults instead. OK.
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:59:09
Then absolutely no reason to insinuate as much. Good to know.
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:55:41
This sub has become such a flagrant garbage mill. What the heck.
@_date: 2017-05-29 10:37:09
The users signaling they want to become an altchain are forking. Miners are under no pressure to comply with them. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 10:46:05


I can use a car but do not become a car myself.
I can use a dollar but do not become a dollar myself.
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:42:46
Actually we do since anyone can become a merchant. Fees are pennies on the dollar, not dollars on the dollar.
@_date: 2017-05-29 10:17:30
People seriously need to detach themselves from this obsession with persons inside a company. The devices produced are not his, they are not all controlled by him, they never were.
Steve Jobs didn't have a kill switch for iOS, that would be Apple. This is why people need to consider what the company would do when buying into their hardware. If Apple let Steve zap phones at random I don't think they would have the userbase they do now.
Bitmain is not Jihan, these are circles that don't directly overlap.

From luke:


@_date: 2017-05-29 10:39:03


Substantiate your claim.


I seem to recall some devs blocking chain expansion unless they are guaranteed returns on their sidechain enterprises. Actual bitcoin users are paying dearly in fees due to this block.
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:52:42
Coinbase has been extraordinary in easing people into using cryptocurrency while sustaining a profitable business. Their recent troubles stem mostly from bitcoin's troubles. Scatterbrained transaction fees, inability to carry out transactions themselves, booming popularity blocking some avenues of ingress (credit cards).
Do have some patience with their staff, no one could really foresee the need to increase company resources in all directions at once before this popularity boost &amp; blockchain crunch.
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:36:22


Bitcoin is bitcoin, UASF (hardfork) is altcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:38:30
So many posts from users seeking to maliciously destroy bitcoin to support their altcoin. So sad.
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:43:33


Tapping the network to divert resources to external entities is not an upgrade. That is a means to ruin btc.
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:57:32


Literally no one said Satoshi is the enemy and this is the context we read his words in on there. What kind of terrible frame up job are you trying to run?


Substantiate your previous claim already, please.


Moments after saying r/bitcoin has only facts? Come on this is a weak show, you can do better.
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:05:51
So you still can't substantiate your claims? I'm guessing you have no way to prove that Lightning network is bitcoin and not just a 3rd party settlement system that uses it?
Please continue prattling on in no real direction, great stuff.
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:37:46


There was this glorious period where price to USD was reasonable and transaction fees for a candy bar were as tolerable as any merchant fee for credit card processing. Adoption was booming with people figuring out how to implement and market the BTC ATM.
I still see growing interest but the folks that matter for the candy bar transaction are understandably turned off at bitcoin's state of affairs. I felt that chance for mass adoption come and go and never got the vibe again. 1 BTC could be 10k USD and I could give a hoot less, it had it's chance to live up to the currency moniker.
@_date: 2017-05-29 10:04:08
What is happening with this sub? It is becoming notorious for vicious personal attacks in rather short order. See this: 
Mods need to step up before Reddit forces them to due to legal inquiries.
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:34:24
UASF ensures a price drop by forcing the chain to enable 3rd party monetization schemes. This devalues the chain by helping certain parties divert resource to their favored layer.
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:48:28


r/btc is blamed for being the puppetmasters of things that you don't like the looks of. Do you still fail to see it or should I rephrase.
@_date: 2017-05-29 10:40:33
Exactly, users signaling they want to fork into an altcoin. Miners do not need to comply and can continue to mine bitcoin just as they have been.
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:00:26
They may reactivate you but the prospect looks dim. 
You likely were pegged as wrongfully using their service and may not be eligible for reactivation or re-registration. Hopefully a human sees this and gives some leeway due to it just being an age issue.
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:07:29
I don't want the UASF altchain. Luke and company's threat of a reorg just come off as terroristic, particularly when reflecting on his positions and actions taken against other alts years past  , using resources to attack them. 
As far as I can tell this mentality has only continued to grow unabated and now he views his vision as the only true path, those supporting him today as I did in the past will be cast aside and made to be the villain later.
This has helped to make Bitcoin caustic as hell and frankly terrible to deal with as no programming progress is allowed on the main chain unless we help Luke and company activate their sidechain for-profit scheme. 
A terrible state of affairs where miners are made out to be evil because they continue to mine using the same software/hardware as in the past. Why would we jump in to support after all of this?
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:27:54
Incorrect, my reply was:




@_date: 2017-06-09 20:11:30
Good to hear. Buy back in small increments instead of doing things like purchasing soda. You'll be back in no time.
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:47:47
You sound so wrapped up in fantasy it is hard to parse what you are actually saying here.
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:40:22
UASF will fail.
