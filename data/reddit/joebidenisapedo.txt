You should probably learn more about it then, since it is. And thus, is not a science, which would require practicing the scientific method.
Vague statistical models + speculation != scientific method. This isn't hard.

I wish I had enough coins for that XD

Whoosh. You seem to have missed the point, which is that the prosecutors are simply lying about their OH SO NOBLE intentions, and in fact want to go after anyone holding Bitcoin.
I.e., this:


Is irrelevant, *because* they are lying.

Same here, the lady sounds like a total narcissist.

The thing that sucks all the joy out of this is the long wait time for these. If they were shipping within a month or less, I'd be all over this, but 4 months waiting is impossible to make anything on given how quickly difficulty rises.

People who unironically make the tulip mania comparison are hyper-punchable morons.

Covering up a $3trn fraud with $3trn of taxpayer money, then printing $10 trn more to prop up the economy (without success) tends to devalue the currency. Surprise surprise.

Not chart that against inflation of USD - I bet it looks like a safer bet when you factor in the 20% loss of purchasing power of USD per year.

Which means nothing since it's issued by central bankers for anyone who says what they want to hear. Not a real Nobel at all.
Not surprising since "economic science" has nothing to do with science.

Considering the main argument for why normies think it will crash is because the MSM told them to think that... spot on.
For those that don't believe me how delusional they are, just check any of the retard r/news threads about it.
Despite the same handful of people being wrong in every other previous thread where they tried to claim Bitcoin would be $0 tomorrow, they still haven't grasped that they're just idiots for listening to always-wrong MSM propagandists.

Not the government, just the Federal Reserve scam.

TL;DR: Stiglitz is a shill retard and should be correctly disregarded.

I can't wait to laugh all the way to the bank at $100k per BTC. 




LMAO. "Science".
Edit: Triggered the economist pseudoscientists. Suck it, posers.
 again: Since you tards are too dim to actually grasp why I think it's funny that you're claiming "economic sciences" has anything to do with science: An entirely subjective field consisting of entirely subjective measures has NOTHING to do with the scienfitic method. It's pseudoscience. Pseudoscience impressing you doesn't actually make it actual science, sorry snowflakes.

LOL, wonder why. Might it be the cancer? Nahhh couldn't be it.

The lack of decent miners is a travesty. I'd be willing to pay $10k for one that doesn't suck and could be profitable, but there aren't any.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:04:17
This exactly. It's funny seeing people claim that it's real science because a central bank issued a fake prize to their pet shills for it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:55:16
Oh my mistake, your anecdote totally proves that "economic sciences" has anything to do with the actual scientific method, despite being based entirely on subjective measurements. /s
