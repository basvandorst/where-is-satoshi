Sitting there whingeing about the price of bitcoin is redundant we all know the ETF will never be excepted with the current exchange information off chain it’s open to manipulation. Sit tight buy the dips and wait, it will be along time before we see a good recovery!

Good point, but what if these bitcoins are acquired direct from say a large mining company that has accumulated these bags over time and have never been exposed to exchanges or a private owner who have sat on bitcoins for a long period of time then decides to sell. For both parties dumping these on an exchange would  drastically alter the price so it make sense to sell OTC. 
My point is wouldn’t it make sense for big traders to buy OTC then manipulate the market via exchanges as and when they please, allowing them to short or long using the likes of bitmex and various other leverage trading platforms??
That said bitcoins purpose is based around a peer to peer transfer so they are not doing anything wrong as far as the protocol is concerned??
How can this be prevented or will it always be the case?

Just a world currency would fine ‘destroying world power’ would probably cause a lot more harm than good..... but keep spreading the good word;)

Correct, all new wallets can be accounted for but trying to pin point who is using them is a lot more difficult with VPN’s and the like?

All crypto markets are driven by bitcoin at the moment so I was merely asking a question??
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:45:29
So what have you been taking cos it’s narrowing ya mind?

While I agree with you to a certain degree, all these other ‘shitcoins’ are also experiments that the space needs to grow. By taking chances albeit with other people’s money they are providing data as to what can be done and mostly not to do!
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:28:05
Exactly, two prime examples are bitcoin ABC and bitcoin SV worst things to ever happen to the space but we live and learn!
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:31:43
I blame myself for being naive and believing in the shit;)

It’s at times like this that you start asking yourself questions, especially when you think you’ve told everybody else the answers!
