Must have been pretty bad. I've been on the site for 2+ years and they've never been down this long.

What is the advantage of texting BTC to someone? Is it confirmed instantly?
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:44:36
signed up earlier last week, still waiting on access code. I am hopeful, they seem to have a good thing going, but we will see. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 14:33:23
Yeah, I did it yesterday, just thought I'd spread the word in case anyone was thinking the same thing. I've learned my lesson for sure.
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:36:50
I really hope it rebounds, I've got 5BTC tied up right now. 
@_date: 2013-08-19 15:12:56
this is also what I do, I wonder if the many deposit/withdraws will attract any attention, especially since it comes up on the statement as COINBASE.

23, M with a chemistry job with free time that allows me to constantly track the BTC market
@_date: 2013-09-05 18:55:15
Yeah, I've sort of done that too. I find if I transfer 0.1 - 0.25 BTC at a time, as long as most go through to my other wallet, I can have enough to go about my business.  
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:16:28
Coinbase ftw!
@_date: 2013-10-01 18:29:50
Sadly I don't have this option either, but it looks very promising. Hoping the 50 BTC instant buy comes back soon. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 15:16:21
seidelryan. why do you ask?
@_date: 2013-07-17 14:53:56
I only started yesterday and probably 90% of the autions I had going are filling a claim. I suspect the other 10% will, they just haven't noticed it on their account yet.

I thought that doing it on eBay would be alright, instead of just PayPal alone, but I was wrong. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 17:49:58
I honestly thought eBay seller protection would protect me if it happened. But that doesn't seem like it will be the case. An expensive lesson for sure.

Not dumb at all, its TCF Bank, not sure what the acronym is but its a big bank in the Midwest.

I haven't had any issues with buying selling btc at coinbase. I just got the instant feature and it is awesome. Had coins within the hour of ordering. I have nothing but good things to say about coinbase.
@_date: 2013-08-19 15:36:37
I'll let you know if anything comes up with me. I've been doing about $300 a week average with TCF in the midwest.
@_date: 2013-06-28 20:27:32
I have transfered money to people and it goes through in 10 sec, but bank account Bitcoin buys take 1 week, if they fixed that, they would be perfect.
@_date: 2013-09-17 14:10:37
Currently $137USD/BTC, might do in a pinch, but way too expensive for any practical utility.

What is interesting is CAMPBX is now keeping up with Bitstamp in terms of price, even without the ACH going through. Seems a lot of people saw the opportunity and jumped on it. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:26:30
You da real MVP
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:55:13
People need to relax. Geez
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:58:20
All accounts
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:01:22
pretty sure the loses will be distributed to everyone.  He has  said all balances are effected
@_date: 2014-02-03 20:08:50
yeah, you have to look beyond the top 5 sellers, there are many other sellers who are selling for a bit higher price. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 16:08:43
From the definition of short term capital gains, that is where I'd think buy/selling of BTC will fall, unless the US government classifies BTC as a currency, then it will be different.  
@_date: 2014-02-03 20:13:17
I have to do the same as well. Did you just fill out a Schedule D? Did you have to list out all your buy/sell prices?
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:36:48
down for me
@_date: 2015-05-26 19:49:21
IDK, it was a hail mary
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:57:22
It was never in my account, someone sent it to my old address before I could tell them not to. It was intercepted and sent to the Bitfinex Hack address
