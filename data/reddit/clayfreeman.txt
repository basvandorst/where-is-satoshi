What is the best way to store/compute monetary values?  Would you be willing to post a code example?

What some of you are failing to realize is that BFL has shipped FPGA units already.  My best friend has one.  Yes, those were late too, but that right there shows me they are trustworthy.  If not, meh, I lost $300 on two Jalapeños.

What exactly is the effect of using floats for money?  I have never had to deal with anything like this.  I am mostly a custom protocol programmer, and usually never deal with monetary values of any kind.

I'm definitely using this site.

1) Password is not hashed or digested in any way whatsoever.  This is a very insecure way to store and compare passwords in a security strict environment.
2) You can edit your cookies to masquerade as a different user.
3) $_COOKIE["logged_in"] is using a string value instead of a bool.  Also, it is unneeded.  You can just check if $_COOKIE["user_id"] is set (although it is a bad idea in the first place).
4) You have an inefficient database query that will make the system perform worse under critical loads.  It is also ill advised to pull the entire user list into memory, especially due to the fact the passwords are not digested (see 
5) Why are you serializing?  This is also going to add extra load.  PHP is slower than MySQL.
6) The die(); line will just leave the user at a blank page.  This is very bad for the user's experience on your site.  They will wonder if something broke, and just keep refreshing the page.
7) Why are you setting the key for the element of the array that is returned from mysql_fetch_array()?  First of all, it isn't used, and second of all, it is just going to be 0-x.  It will have no importance and only wastes space, if not degrading performance (in a minor, most likely unnoticeable way).
8) You aren't even using set_cookie().  This will do nothing on the client's end.
This code could be much better!  I know this is an obvious joke, but if I were to write something like this, I would have done the following:
1) Filtered down the SQL query to something specific to the user's username.  This can be case sensitive or case insensitive, whichever preference you or I have.  If there are no results returned, have the function return (bool)false, or have it return an array with the error code, and potentially a custom message.  This is so much better for performance since it takes less time for MySQL AND PHP to process.  This basically allows higher load.
2) I would hash the password and override the original data in $_POST.  This may or may not help secure the original value from being discovered in raw memory.  I'm not an expert at memory, but this is probably more secure.  Don't leave the raw password set ANYWHERE in the code.
3) Only store hashed values for passwords in the database.  There is no reason to even use two way encryption, or store it plaintext.  Just hash and go.
4) Set a challenge as the cookie that the cookie must pass to verify it is the person who it should be.  Also, maybe make the cookie specific to the current session as well, or a value passed in the user agent as well to make it harder for the cookie to be stolen.
5) DEFINITELY use SSL.  This is a MUST for form submissions of this type.
6) Never use die(). At the least redirect to a page with a success message or something other than just a white page.
7) Store users in a schema such as [UID, username, email, passhash].  Store other irrelevant data in another table.  It will just slow things down and get in the way while logging in.
Essentially, plan things out, and try to think in a secure manner before attempting to make something such as a login system.  You can never be too secure.

use bitstamp

I got this in an email.

Khan's Academy is best academy.
EDIT: I would give gold if I had the spare change.  Happy to know they have these videos.

I understand the joke :D
I was just offering a detailed analysis over what was done and why it was bad.

Not through BitInstant.  Might want to contact them to have them add support for BitStamp Coupon to Dwolla.  Although, if you have PayPal setup with a bank account, it serves the same purpose as Dwolla.
@_date: 2013-05-15 21:01:19
Yeah, it is confusing.  I'm not sure why they have it setup like this.

I've never had a problem with BFL (aside from shipping delays).  I ordered a BFL Monarch just a few days ago.  I successfully received my Jalapeños a month and a half ago.

Don't let this go live with missing features! BitStamp Coupons and such are missing!
