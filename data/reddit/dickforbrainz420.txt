@_date: 2017-08-17 18:36:27

Cool story bro
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:53:48
What poker site do yoh play on?
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:49:22
Put a little in here and there, it's not a get rich quick type situation. Put what you can live without in btc. No one knows how it's going to turn out. I personally put about 100 bucks each paycheck and have gotten a decent return. Not enough to quit my job but enough to put a smile on my face everytime I see my account  
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:31:08
You're still new here huh
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:38:34
Yea that is kinda my big concern about crypto in general, it doesn't make sense to buy things not in fiat due to the fees associated with btc. I guess I'm just looking for ways to be able to spend btc like I would other fiat. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:41:22
The perfect answer right here thanks man
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:44:07
You will have better luck if youAsk your magic 8 ball, no one has a clue of how the market is going to go.
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:25:56
I believe if you add your bank account it should let you deposit more, look it up and find out tho 
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:57:57
Thanks I looked on their site for a little and couldn't find anything, much appreciated 
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:12:41
Hmm interesting, is there a way to setup different fee pricing when buying then? I'm using coinbase and then moving to my mycelium wallet 
Edit: nevermind I just looked through my wallet and figured it out, I just need to find a way through coinbase I guess 
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:47:21
You must not be from America, we have plenty of round people 
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:21:24
Does this mean that there is more demand than supply? Still new and figuring this whole thing out.
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:42:47
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:38:08
Keep them both, but if you are committed to bitcoin all future investments should be in bitcoin. However having multiple crypto is never a bad idea. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:20:50
Thanks man much appreciated. Hopefully you have a window seat to the moon 
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:05:12
Time to diversify and get stock in amd and buy more coin :)
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:56:15
Alaskan here, nice to meet you neighbor
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:50:42
You just made my day 
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:32:47
Should the most recent fork help this? I'm not sure if it has been implemented yet but I thought a big part of the fork was to shorten TX time?
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:36:53
Above 6800 atm please check your facts before posting thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:57:42
This is what bitcoin needs. How do we make this happen.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:23:14
Glad I have lite and bitcoin :) what a time to be alive. Today is a good day 
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:16:02
r/tress might enjoy this 
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:06:35
Well done sir
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:50:51
Hahahahaha to fucking funny 
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:56:29
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:42:51
Does it not charge a fee when transferring out of gdax?
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:56:52
Not enough but got some more 
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:49:25
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:59:43
Not bank but hardwear/mobile wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:16:04
I'm not sure we could handle that many transactions quite yet, not super knowledgeable about the new lighting network but I feel like we are still need some work on transaction fees and time. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:54:39
Someone plz remake, I would but I don't know how 
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:23:03
Does this apply to gdax as well?
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:48:03
Said it before but wanted to play poker online and bitcoin was the easiest way to get playing. Started reading and forgot all about online poker amd focus on btc until recently :/
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:17:07
Bovada, they gave me 150% bonus for deposits with bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:43:38
Do you know if they have this for sale anywhere?
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:02:30
It's good to spend and if you are worried about spending your btc just buy the same amount back right away. That's what I do when I buy using btc 
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:54:34
Thanks man, I'll buy you a drink on the moon some day
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:44:21
 If you are looking for some sort of validation about your decision you won't find it here. Bitcoin gives you freedom to do whatever you want with your money.
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:28:23
Thanks man, just when I got comfortable with gdax as well. Time to switch again lol 
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:28:14
I'm rewatching breaking bad right now and I just watched this episode yesterday. Gave me a chuckle, thanks mate
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:48:12
Never a bad time if you believe in the system. Noone knows how this will play out. Invest what you can lose and learn as much as you can and make your own opinion about what you thibk will happen. The more you know the better off you will be 
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:42:12
At least she is starting some kind of investment. Might not be what we believe in but it's something. I wouldn't call her a moron. Learn some respect, it's what the btc community needs. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:00:12
Yea, not gambling on her child's future. She did make to her the right choice. People are going to say all kinds of things about bitcoin. Let them, it will only make us stronger. But keep the negativity out of it. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:43:21
Congrats man, keep on keeping on 
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:40:54
Wanted to play poker online, bitcoin was easier and safer to deposit money and play vs attaching my bank account 
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:11:27
I'm still new to but coin, can someone please help me out by explaining what happens when it gets to 100%? I feel like if there is more miners there is more product making the price go down. Am I thinking about this wrong?
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:05:08
I live in alaska  
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:59:18
Sorry for all the questions but from what I read using a personal credit card is a bad idea since it can be traced. Would you recommend visa gift card or would personal card work fine 
*edit alaska is great! Come visit nice people everywhere 
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:17:13
Okay I just don't want my identity to be stolen
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:41:22
Well maybe things will settle and go down, and then sky rocket back up once it goes through 
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:46:17
Have you heard much about samourai?
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:10:37
Thank you kind sir 
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:19:45
When purchasing bitcoins, should I use mycelium app with a prepaid visa gift card or should I go else where and buy?
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:28:37
Do you know much about simplex? I just bought some through the mycelium app and it transferred me to simplex and I don't feel 100% safe with it 
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:34:12
Have you heard much about samourai?
@_date: 2019-05-15 08:10:25
Almost as good as the pen15 club
@_date: 2019-05-15 08:13:41
You're too smart to be hanging around that other sub with a bunch of autistic fucks take a upvote you basterd
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:38:16
Haha my btc goal is to have 1.80085 btc
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:08:45
They are not yours unless you have been given the keys, their vault system is misleading to my understanding and acts as a wallet but in reality it isnt. There is a bunch of wallets out there with different pros and cons, spend about 1 hour doing a little research and find one the fits your needs.
