I didn't read all your stuff because half of the content is hate and accusations about BCH without much evidence to back it up. You completely ignore the fact that there are people in btc who are no BCH shills. You always refer to the price of BCH as if everyone only has to care about that and can't be interested in the technology or its us cases.
 You say I have no coherent investing strategy yet the only thing I said was that I divested from Bitcoin way before BCH even existed and without saying in what I divested in. So without knowing what I did you belittle it. Very nice. 
 
 It seems as much pointless to me to have a discussion with you and it seems you share the same feeling about me. Which is exactly the point why I and many others don't frequent this place anymore. 
 Have a good day

It's in the blog post that they are working on supporting it... Also that they plan to support lightning...

You seem to think = BCH. I started reading in 2015 and started divesting from Bitcoin early 2016 because of the scaling debate. I didn't like how this sub was managed back then and switched to That was way before BCH even existed or thought of. 
 
 I read some of your links not all because the things you wrote here and in those links show you are pretty biased and it seems you can't fathom honest and critically thinking people might exist in the other sub. Or you just tend to over generalize it.
 
Finally even in this post you give an argument for modlogs since you say will claim that he is banned here. If only there was a way for a somewhat neutral entity like me to check that claim, or for Roger to prove it. Well I guess Modlogs would provide that.

 Also: I am no cronie of Roger Ver and I don't agree with the way he handles things many times. I still prefer @_date: 2017-11-15 18:49:58
lol thanks, I thought the same thing but couldn't remember where it came from. Good old Jon Stewart :-)
