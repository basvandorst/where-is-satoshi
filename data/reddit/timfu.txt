Yep I feel any profit Ill make from mtgox trading will be wiped out by Bitfloor disappearing with my money :(
@_date: 2013-04-08 09:17:42
I've transferred money from New Zealand to MTGOX twice in USD, and each time it's taken roughly 36 hours to appear.
I did a transfer just over a week to Bitfloor, but still no sign of my money.  And now I've missed out on another big rise.  How long should I wait until I should be concerned?
@_date: 2013-10-09 08:41:14
lol, that's way quick compared to what I've experienced.. I love the concept of bitcoin, but to me it makes bitcoin hopeless if it takes this long to convert it back to cash.
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:55:52
Yea I'm in it for the long haul, once a few more places start supporting it I'll use it to buy stuff..
Hopefully after it reevaluates it'll be worth a lot more than 146 :)
@_date: 2013-11-04 09:36:55
I'm two days off three months since I first requested my money withdrawn.  Something is awfully fishy as to why it's taking that long and I'm thinking it's their liquidity.  They need more people to buy bitcoins so they have the money to pay people withdrawing.

I did my transfer from NZ 9 days ago, still no sign of my money :( 
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:28:57
sweet, can you PM me when it's good to go? I'll happily pay for the software.  Alas I can't pay for it in Bitcoins though.  My main currency is NZD, so I have to convert my bitcoins to USD pricing, then convert the USD price to NZD.  Be nice just to tell at a glance.
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:51:05
When did you deposit it and from what country in what currency out of curiosity..
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:49:09
Thank you for doing this, the more stores that do the more popular bitcoin becomes, we all win.. :)
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:01:50
Oh well, time will tell, and if it drops its kinda to be expected I guess..  We just need a few big retailers in the states to start supporting it :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:44:57
I love Google authenticator, simple technology, but so effective..
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:38:29
It was my first time trading, and I knew it wouldn't be easy / plus too good to be true.. But yea as I mentioned I'll stick in for long haul and see what happened, as ill kick myself less for losing all my money, than potentially gaining a lot..
At least by buying in now I've secured some coins, so if things go crazy again at a later date I don't have the panic of trying to convert my money..
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:00:42
Thanks, had tried that one, but I want something that remembers how many bitcoins I have.  Am keen to see Simons one though..
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:26:31
Thanks man, to be honest I can afford to lose the money so I'm not too worried, I'm putting in a total of $6k USD between MTGOX and Bitfloor, just the first 1k USD I transferred was the first to show up at MTGOX tonight and I thought "man I'd better buy now or I'll miss out.. " and it plunged.. 
The guys at work have been giving me shit investing in it.. as I explain to them Apple stocks were like $9 back in 2004, and peaked at $700 late last year.. pretty good ROI...  and if I lose my entire $6k.. oh well, nothing ventured.. but, if the price of Bitcoin goes up substantially as a lot of people are predicting.. well.. I won't be complaining.. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:54:46
Hey I've done a transaction, twice, using ASB bank to transfer USD to my MtGox account.. Took 36 hours each time to arrive and be ready to trade, and could do it all from my web browser, didn't need to goto the bank.
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:16:40
Everybody singalong.. There was a salesman sold a car, and Spanko was his name-o.. S.P.A.N.K.O, S.P.A.N.K.O, S.P.A.N.K.O and Spanko was his name-o...
But seriously, awesome job on getting your boss to accept them.. :)  People like you are the reason Bitcoin will work.
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:18:41
fuck, I just brought $1000 USD worth at $146 USD each :(
@_date: 2013-04-08 11:10:43
Sent them an email a few hours ago, but not expecting a prompt reply as I'm imagining they'll be fairly busy and it's still early morning over there.  So I thought I'd see what other people had experienced..
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:28:38
Assuming what you're saying is correct, my opinion would be cash out soon, but do it slowly.  Eg cash out 500 coins a day. You've set yourself up for life already without the extra stress of potentially losing it all.  I'd also recommend using Mt.Gox and get your parents involved to help.  Possibly see a GOOD accountant to do things legitimately but minimize your tax exposure.  Actually, does a kid under 18 have to pay income tax?
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:23:56
I deposited $1000 USD from New Zealand to my Mt Gox account in Japan..  I did it about 8:30am yesterday on Tuesday, morning and it appeared almost exactly 36 hours later at 8:30pm Wednesday night.. 
So of course then worrying I was missing the boat, I immediately brought bitcoins at $146 USD each.. and the price has just plunged dramatically.. silly me... 
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:29:20
Never a truer word has been spoken.. Go with this advice..
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:02:58
Very good advice, some of t I hadn't thought of, thank you :)
@_date: 2013-04-24 10:29:28
This is the thing, I think porn will help bitcoin no end.. an anonymous way to get porn without the wife seeing your credit card bill.. I read VHS took off because it made porn available on it more than beta did..
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:20:05
yes, I just paid $146 USD each for $1000 USD worth of bitcoins about 35 minutes ago... :(  
Wish I'd paid more attention.. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:31:47
Exactly, like if I'd held off an hour I would've saved about $15 USD per bitcoin.. but oh well.. at the end of the day I could've held off an hour and paid $15 USD more.. had I saw that big bubble of 10,000 BTC coming I would've quickly researched more the effects of it... but I was lazy and greedy!! :)
Problem is whilst I've known about Bitcoin for a couple of years now, I, like a lot of people I imagine, only started paying attention this weekend..
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:27:29
But Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galatica.
@_date: 2013-11-04 09:39:49
DO NOT USE MtGox.  I can't emphisise that enough.  I've waited three months for my money and still haven't got it, just plenty of vague non-committal replies to my emails.  I suspect they haven't got the liquidity to cash out withdraws and are instead relying on new investors to fund withdraws.  Aka a Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2013-11-04 09:32:53
I'm only a couple of days off it being three months since I requested my money withdrawn.  The whole thing to me reeks of lack of liquidity and they're waiting on more people to invest to be able to pay back money.  
@_date: 2013-04-01 12:04:29
Nice :) I hope you brought a lot of bitcoins as that'd be a nice wee windfall..
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:18:46
This is the thing, it's a gamble.  You may be lucky, and hell if you'd invested in January you really would've been if you cashed out now... but also you might buy now and be really unlucky.. only a magic crystal ball could tell us.
Personally.. I wouldn't risk it, only invest what you can afford to lose..
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:53:33
The more I read up about it the more fascinating it is.  One of the guys at work who I said to that he should invest in it a couple of weeks ago was all "no, it's not a real currency and it's not backed by anything.. waste of time".. but I haven't rubbed it in his face, yet, as I've been worried about it dropping away, but then I've only invested money that I won't miss for a second if I lose it all.
But what is interesting about Bitcoin is there hasn't been anything like it in the history of the world before, so there is no benchmark to gauge it against.
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:06:08
Good advice, helps remove the guesswork..  I need to learn up more about it..
@_date: 2013-10-09 02:32:25
lol that's true..  when I first brought Bitcoins they seemed the "safest" option.  Oh well.. I'll just keep waiting.. thanks for your reply..
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:39:07
Cheers, reassuring :)  it's not the money I'm worried about, it's the excitement of watching the money grow if that makes sense... like the thrill of looking what it's upto on my phone and going "yep, sweet move"..
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:51:04
it'll depend on if your boss is a user or producer.. :) if he has his own porn company then that's what we need..
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:55:01
Exactly.. just need a few biggies adopting it.. will that ever happen though? I guess they're worried about the legal side of things and the safety side of it to.
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:46:41
I did it with ASB bank in New Zealand, who I bank with... Transfers to mtgox take about 36 hours.. But thought I'd try bitfloor... Oh how I wish I hadn't.. I've missed out on about $60 USD price rise per coin because of it..
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:41:06
I am in NZ and used ASB bank, I just transfered my $ is USD straight to MtGox and went ahead and brought bitcoins.  I am still in the queue to be verified but there's no rush as I've already brought several thousand dollars worth of coins no problems.
@_date: 2013-04-09 10:41:59
I deposited $1600 USD into Bitfloor over a week ago, and it still hasn't shown in my account and they haven't answered my emails :( I'm getting nervous
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:25:43
Someone made a valid point before about how porn companies need to start accepting Bitcoins.  I read somewhere that because the porn industry adopted VHS is why it won out over Beta, even though Beta was technically better.  When porn companies jump on the band wagon it'll get huge uptake, also they need to accept micropayments.
@_date: 2013-04-03 10:06:56
It's kinda chicken / egg a bit.. Like we need them to offer it to spend it, they need to see us willing to spend it to offer it..
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:47:46
Sadly I never thought of that, but bitcoins would revolutionize buying porn..  No more worrying about the wife seeing the credit card.. and as you say, people could easily buy micro content..
@_date: 2013-11-04 09:31:07
I'm two days off being exactly 3 months since I requested my money withdrawn..  I wish I'd kept it in there now as it would've doubled.
Like you I get emails saying "there are delays" etc.. but I think three months is a joke.
I'm worried that it's now a bit like a pyramid scheme and they actually don't have enough money to pay people out, so they have to wait on more people to put money in before they can pay out.. 
@_date: 2013-10-09 11:02:40
Good advice, I don't need the money urgently but I think I will do that, just I don't know when they're finally going to send it :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:35:27
10-4 Rubber Ducky, I sure will... I actually donated $100 USD to Openelec.tv two weeks as I love their software, it's awesome.  I suggest everyone checks it out.
