Is This a joke? If you’re not trolling you need to go see a psychiatrist. You’re addicted to gambling.
Don’t waste your life savings invest 1-20% max in a speculative asset like bitcoin. I hope that this is a joke. 300k is a lot of money you don’t need to take a risk like this just invest in index-funds instead and invest  1-20% max into bitcoin or any other speculative asset for that matter. Whatever else coin you’re investing in is probably a lot more risky. Think about the downside.

It’s 95% of his money.. so yhea it is I don’t care if he doesn’t think that it is... it is

What? indexfunds return 8% per year on average what are you talking about?
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:50:55
I invested 20% into bitcoin when it was 5 k 
And I’m still holding. 
I have 80% in cash waiting for a downturn in the stock market, if the market crashes ill invest 70% or so into index funds or maybe even 90% if I have sold my bitcoin position at that point. 
I’m only 21 though so maybe you shouldn’t listen to me but I have a weird feeling that this will make me a lot of money.

Interesting, yhea dude you might be right about that.
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:43:26
It’s actually 8% after inflation per year
10% before inflation do some research ma dude

My guess is that the next bubble will pop at 40 k in about a year

I mean no I don’t think so,  I would be kind of surprised even if it went up to that to be honest. But we’ll see my friend.
