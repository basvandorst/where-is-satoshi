A 6000 bitcoin sell wall was put up on binance at this time. Dont think it has anything to do with a small polish exchange. 
If someone can sell 6000 btc and it has almost no impact on price = me bullish

Who knows how many transactions there will be but even with the miner receiving ~0.2btc per block. If btc is $100k thats not a bad haul.

Thousand of unconfirmed transactions waiting and some asshat mines a block with only 700 transactions.

This is a bottle neck. Someone smarter than me will put forward a proposal to improve the network in this area.

Do you collect fees doing this or is it just for the good of the network?

While a nice article explaining mining difficulty it doesn't mention anything about it being a leading indicator to a bull run.
