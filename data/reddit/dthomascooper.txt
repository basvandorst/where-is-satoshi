Lol..wait til Roger hears about this ...he's  gonna be really pissed..let's get the camera set up ��
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:06:17
Don't  be so peevish
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:37:27
I've subscribed young man so don't let me down...I expect some decent fudless content ��
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:15:07
Lol...don't  be so pedantic ��
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:30:43
Lol..great news buddy ��
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:44:22
I do..and you're right ��
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:37:18
Great advice...it's only the seed that matters not the wallet ��
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:10:43
Your hard wallet is not the most valuable item that you have ...the seed words are much more valuable and must be treated as such. So the question you  need to ask yourself is where do I safely keep my seed words ��

Ivan on Tech interviewed him on his YouTube channel a couple of weeks back  ...take a look at his channel.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:14:52
Another uneducated dickwit opens his mouth.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:28:59
Well said friend...sounds like Roger's clone brother.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:52:31
Sounds fair ��
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:16:46
Yeah... Could be guilt money ��....nah,  Roger's  to self absorbed to understand that concept. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:46:04
This may sound a little expensive but the simplest thing to do for complete peace of mind is just to buy 2 hardware wallets and test out your recovery phrase on the second wallet...you now have a copy of your wallet and can sleep nice and easy at night...given the stress that this process can cause if you have a reasonable amount of crypto it's by far the most cost effective and stressless way to do it ��
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:16:40
Ver is a narcissistic sociopath who's only moral compass has money as its North pole..his warped perspective makes him believe that anyone who isn't a millionaire is an inferior lifeform..he's just a very sad and angry individual who isn't fit to breath the same air as Andreas.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:33:57
Well done and welcome to making a positive contribution to the Bitcoin community ��
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:56:18
Roger..is that you...yeah it is
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:37:22
You're only saying that cos you like pies...win either way ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:40:37
Then they shouldn't be accepting new customers until they are able to cope...greed is not a good enough excuse I'm afraid. Until they have the requisite number of support staff they should close their doors to all new customers and concentrate on giving a decent level of support to the customers they have, but of course they're too greedy and self serving to do that.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:44:13
Lol...go for it buddy..take those bastards down...let's get anonymous involved and hack them into the stone age ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:23:38
What a complete load of anodyne bollocks...do they really think that Bitcoin holders won't know the difference between a segwit and.a legacy account..get your fucking fingers out you lazy twats and sort it out...it's not frigging rocket science. If you can't provide a simple change in the code and interface then you shouldn't be in business...and tell your buddy Roger he's a twat too.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:58:16
Lol..ya wee scamp..��
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:06:01
Chopping onions here guys...sorry, but I always find Andreas so inspirational and my main teacher in the Bitcoin community. I'd be surprised if I've missed any of his videos and teachings.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:51:45
But without your raindrop that pool would not be quite as full ��
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:06:03
I'm running a full node on an older laptop...so no, very little power usage, but as has already been said it can use a lot of bandwidth which can be a problem if your ISP has a monthly bandwidth cap.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:11:57
Thanks...I really do like it a lot. They have a fantastic range of coins and the inbuilt Shapeshift and Changelly save a lot of faffing abput. I just wish they would hurry up and bring out a desktop version ��
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:11:19
The ledger site is where I bought mine...no problems and very fast delivery.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:55:55
Of course...they're still on the blockchain and you still get a 1 to 1 ratio of the new block chain coin. The only problem is whether various wallets will support the forked coin and how you are able to claim them.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:42:12
We need to mine memes with a bitcoin meme blockchain...no asics though ��
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:51:37
Thanks for the link..much appreciated 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:47:08
Let's have a cuppa and a sticky bun ��
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:49:29
I exchanged mine through the Coinomi android wallet which has both Changelly and Shapshift built in .
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:25:04
I actually just used the Coinomi android wallet without any problems.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:00:30
Lol...not bad ��
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:57:06
Craig...is that you...yeah it is 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:57:36
A very apt analogy..well said. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:53:50
Lol...great idea ��
@_date: 2018-05-01 09:10:54
To be honest I don't think even he could afford that ��
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:42:15
I wouldn't sweat it buddy...it's rather like Apple threatening to sue every greengrocer  for calling certain fruit they sell ..well, apples ��
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:52:12
Lol..I'm surprised they're not married ��
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:27:03
This is what baffles me the most....two obviously lying, sociopathic narcissists and still ffs the crypto community invites them to events... not surprisingly the barefaced twats turn up....but why do we keep on giving them legitimacy...Stephen Hawking was right, there are multiple universes and unfortunately those two have slipped from bizarro universe into ours.
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:44:35
You're absolutely right. Some of the shit, uninformed and lazy journalism related to Bitcoin I've seen in this poor excuse of a newspaper is astonishing....it's been completely non-objective and shameful. They've  obviously  been told by their masters to continue with a negative narrative on Bitcoin and not let facts get in the way...if I was a Guardian journalist or editor I'd hang my head in shame.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:40:27
To be honest I think you're being a bit unkind to rats...maybe a flea on a rat..the kind that spreads the plague.
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:11:48
My thoughts as well.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:52:00
Well articulated and very true.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:47:19
Here we go...mempool clearing..BCH falling...Bitcoin rising...getting back to 'normal'��
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:01:37
With the term 'Miners' repeated ad nauseum...another suit sending us to sleep with his corporate 'wisdom'.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:34:07
Don't worry..I entirely agree...I also have multiple backups in various places..any memory, no matter how good the system is far to fragile to entrust your hard earned crypto to...plus, as you rightly say,  the brains not much good if it ain't working at all. Sincerely though, I appreciate your concern...thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:36:23
Nope..lol ��
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:12:19
Well said ��
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:51:14
Excellent link...I've watched dozens of his videos and Andreas nails it on this one. It should  be required viewing for all big block fans.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:55:40
A very erudite and concise summary..well said sir!
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:41:58
Don't worry,  BTC is safe...I've been in for the last four years and have seen enough  ups and downs to give me a hundred heart attacks ��...I've never sold and will not for many years to come. This latest phase is just a result of Ver and his cronies trying to manipulate the market..it will settle down by tomorrow when BCH introduces the new difficulty protocol which will smooth out the system and make sure that BTC is the most profitable to mine.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:09:10
I'm running a full node on an older laptop with a 1 TB external hard drive without any problems at all apart from the extra bandwidth...don't worry you won't have any problems, and well done for supporting the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:28:39
You're never down until you sell my friend..and no capital gains or losses until that happens ✌
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:21:36
Very well said my friend ��
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:43:36
You have a wise and loving grandpa who knows he has a wise grandson .
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:17:20
Lmao...as long as it's not a bitcoin gold fish ��
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:10:12
Yes, I've watched this...and many more....Andreas at his brilliant best.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:54:52
I couldn't agree more my friend...Roger Ver(min) and his cabal are the types that will bullshit and smile while screwing you over and leave you to pick up the tab...they could teach Machiavelli a trick or two. Andreas is the type of guy who would never let you down and you'd be proud to call a good friend..
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:54:17
Yes, they are both essentially the same wallet with the same private keys showing the same balance...I've done this with a couple of hardware wallets to test the backup phrase and have an extra copy of my crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:48:10
Actually Dominic O'Brien has a method where you can convert the numbers 0 -99 into the initials of names of  famous people ...and then you associate that person..ie the position of the word, with the seed word. Sounds complicated but It's far easier than it seems..plus as you say you have them in a room or with items doing an activity or in a story...as long as it produces vivid active imagary in the memory.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:15:44
Look honey, I just printed another sheet of your favourite design of toilet paper.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:21:46
Lol...yes, that is always a big problem..I've memorized my 48 words..24 each for Trezor and Ledger using a memory system devised by Dominic O'Brien..Memory Palaces are good too..or storytelling/journey methods.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:44:43
Looks like a coordinated load of bullshit to me...how the hell do multiple exchanges suddenly have simultaneous outages..Roger...put that plug back in the socket ��
@_date: 2018-03-03 00:29:06
You're  right buddy...the woman's a complete twit...her only attribute, like most politicians, is that she's  a shameless gobshite.
@_date: 2019-01-06 22:56:44
This is complete ageist bollox. I'm sixty five, love technology and have embraced Bitcoin for the last five years..and many other forms of crypto.
@_date: 2019-01-10 23:06:22
That's true..probably just the grumpiest ��
@_date: 2019-01-07 10:54:14
I dunno, he looks pretty serious in that photo ;).
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:25:44
Roger the dodger ��
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:28:53
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:55:56
Have a look at the recent video of Ivan on Tech...he's much more informative about the technical aspects 
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:25:49
Lol...that made me chuckle ��
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:47:38
Excellent..you've done the right thing and it will give you great peace of mind to know your hard earned crypto is safe. I've got Nano and Trezor..I couldn't get my crypto off my computer quick enough ��
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:49:58
I've had mine running about a week...Satoshi 15.01. Ladies and gentlemen...lock and load and man the ramparts.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:58:35
I can only speak for the Trezor wallet interface which supports BCH and had a 'tool' to claim the BCH shortly after the fork. This was obviously on a 1 to 1 basis - 1 Bitcoin gave you 1 BCH. Regardless, whatever wallet you have have, if it is your own wallet - not on an exchange - either a hardware, paper or software wallet then you control the keys and thus the Bitcoin and will be entitled to an equal amount of BCH provided you had the Bitcoin in your wallet before the fork. I'm not sure which wallets support BCH which you can transfer your BCH into, but I'm sure doing a google search will give you pleny of info about how to transfer your BCH entitlement into whichever wallet you choose. Remember, it's on the blockchain so will always be there with all the transactions from your private keys...so there's no rush.
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:23:26
Satoshi 15.0.1...fully armed, locked and loaded, bayonets fixed...they shall not pass. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:01:59
Surely you mean that guy ...lol..��
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:05:02
Bitcoin Bullshitium....they took the wrong fork and detoured into a field ;-)
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:55:23
No probs...I hope that helped. If you can afford it at some point get a hardware wallet it's much safer.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:54:16
Bitbargain, Bittylicious,Quickbitcoin...I've personally used all of these without problems.
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:12:56
It doesn't receive anything...it stores your private keys. Those keys 'unlock' the transactions you have made to the public addresses associated with those private keys and which are now stored on the block chain. The ledger wallet app simply acts as the interface to show the current balance of those transactions..ie your Bitcoins . 
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:27:01
I think the point here is that you can put your ledger any place which gives you peace of mind. More importantly the ledger is merely a hardware receptacle for your private keys...which ultimately and more importantly are represented by your seed words...they can be used to recover your private keys on any compatible device or wallet and are therefore much more valuable.
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:02:05
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:17:27
Mine does exactly the same...presumably because I downloaded the wallet separately. It's a bit annoying but I've never looked into changing it...but yes, you're not the only one.
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:14:51
I find the wallet to be very unstable with constant batch errors while trying to send maximum amounts of crypto and it not updating balances correctly...this has led to great uncertainty about whether amounts have been sent..all in all I'm not impressed. Although it doesn't have as many coins I much prefer Exodus .
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:49:56
I use Bitcoin Ticker Widget..loads of coins, portfolio, graphs..simple to use.
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:57:20
At some point there will be plenty of information about how you can 'claim' the new coin. Essentially, if you have ownership of your private keys...which you do if your BTC is on your own wallet...then you already have ownership of the new coin on a 1 to 1 basis...just HODl and don't worry.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:23:02
Same here ��
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:39:00
Lol...you are so right.people really are dense sometimes...Ivan is a good guy with a great sense of homour ...he's poking fun at the ridiculous idea that anyone can fork Bitcoin and produce any shitcoin they want..simply because the code is open source ��
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:10:05
Selling snake oil
@_date: 2017-10-05 22:40:33
I'm just doing that right now. Slapped a 1TB drive on to an older laptop, installed the latest core and am downloading the 'chain'..very easy to do and no problems.
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:21:40
Nano or Trezor are just the job..I have both...your keys ...your Bitcoin .
@_date: 2018-04-28 09:17:46
And sociopath
@_date: 2019-05-07 13:30:59
You are so right buddy. I've found that generally people are just too bone idle to be bothered learning even the bare minimum about wallets, seeds, passwords or anything else...they want it handed to them without effort. My theory is that if they are not interested in learning about crypto when I'm alive in order to benefit from any inheritance then the lazy twats don't deserve it when I'm dead..
