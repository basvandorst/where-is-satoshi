To be honest, the term "Trump supporter" is probably more insulting to somebody's character and intellect than any of the other silly names people come up with.

doubt this is real, but it might be fun sending an encrypted message to the email using Satoshi's pgp key and seeing what you get back
@_date: 2018-08-31 05:26:03
I agree with this. Additionally you could encrypt your trade secrets and act as your own intellectual security. If your efforts fail, however, you'll probably be wishing for some legal framework to protect your interests.

You are absolutely correct. AOL was one of the shittiest ISPs around. But they shoved their free trial CDs down everybody's throat for years that America had no choice but to get Online.

wait 3 years and it'll be .5 btc
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:25:41
The incentive not to mine empty blocks should be that it would ruin the experience of users being able to transact in a timely manner and make it less usable. Unusable network would  devalue btc to where it isnt profitable to mine. With a single bitcoin network, this incentive should be valid. But now they have bcash and the miners dont have any incentive to stay on bitcoin if bcash is more profitable.
