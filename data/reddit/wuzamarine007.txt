They can counter sue for a fart. its all a matter of weather or not they have a case and the resources to go through all the motions.
I'm sure it's something else and not them trying to hold your money though, you should file in court anyways.
You don't have to schedule a hearing, but nothing wrong with getting one brewing on the table to state your claim.
Yes, they are going to close your account no matter what. Mine just got shut down and I have never pushed more that $400 across the wire.
All US customers are going underground with their purchases at this point because of FinCEF.
Looks like they are going to try and regulate Bitcoin out of existence BUT they can't.
They are just going to push the price higher.
Bitcoin is slowly becoming a narcotic, in Uncle Sam's eyes.

with a quantum computer?  I wouldn't care about your public key.
@_date: 2016-06-14 10:22:52
with quantum, that encryption needs to be upgraded a fuckton.
more like, 256000000 bit
these are the serious issues that need to be worked out.
@_date: 2016-06-14 03:02:44
since day one, if I have your 'key', I have your coins.
No signature required.
@_date: 2016-06-14 02:59:15
I can still hit randon btc "keys" till I hit yours.
@_date: 2016-06-14 02:53:45
but, its not going to happen over night. there is going to first be 'the privileged few' that will have access, which is going on now.
then the big corps are going to pick them up (next, and coming quickly).
then you will have brokered access (at this point something best be done)
then general public will get access, but at sky high prices.
There are a few levels to achieve before its user friendly and on phones.
@_date: 2016-06-14 03:06:44
requisite data missing?
you have an entire blockchain you can load into a hashtable.  All the data you need.
@_date: 2016-06-14 09:34:33
thats what a rocket fast processor is for.
@_date: 2016-06-14 08:46:25
How will the user create the new extended hash key?
@_date: 2016-06-14 11:03:24
it's only 1 (uno) single hash that is 256,000,000 (this number is grabbed from thin air) in length
Which does take a considerable amount extra, on todays' machines. But not on a quantum machine, it would take the same amount of time.
@_date: 2016-06-14 03:01:42
when did btc keys (and the auth structure) change?
@_date: 2016-06-14 03:08:18
I'm talking about the private keys, not the public keys.
@_date: 2016-06-14 19:26:15
Both wiki and I, am calling you a liar, brother.
@_date: 2016-06-14 02:36:48
bruteforce the blockchain directly
Bunch of those  ^^
@_date: 2016-06-14 09:59:34
I have brute forced many a passwords and fully understand the process algorithms. With a quantum chip and brute force, the private key is the most direct path and what needs to be protected against quantum technology..
@_date: 2016-06-14 19:22:15
No where is more than 1 thread/ core is required for parallel processing
@_date: 2016-06-14 15:05:37
No respawning ever.
That's completely useless 
You run parallel on a single thread.
You have 2^300 boat spaces to work with. Per cycle
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:14:41
I surely will my friend. You have given me enough google words to keep me busy for a little while.
Thank you again for your reply!
@_date: 2016-06-14 03:23:56
thats where I think you might be surprised.
parallel processing is what quantum does best
@_date: 2016-06-14 10:09:32
In a quantum environment?
ideally would be in an entangled state.
at this time there appears to be no possible way to hack into an entangled state.
@_date: 2016-06-14 20:59:09
very true!
But the point that I am trying to make (gone into detail in threads above) is that with quantum computers you'll be able to take advantage of the most direct path, the front door.
using today's computers, random guessing 'private keys' would take millions of years, given all of the possibilities. But using a Qubit, those millions disappear.
@_date: 2016-06-15 03:29:10
Thank you for the very 'in depth' reply.  I had looked for something as good as this on Google and nothing came close.
If there was a way to do it, it would be right there in state manipulation. Something was telling me that you could make use of co-joined dependent states. possibly a virtual independence?
this is technology I am yet to play with and still trying to grasp conceptually.
But if you can't brute force the private key, that leaves only the public key and they already patched that one up.
I'm out of ideas   :)
@_date: 2016-06-14 19:38:20
I had an LTP port on my puter WAY before I had multi thread or multi processor technology. Had it beat by about 10 yrs..
@_date: 2016-06-14 03:25:02
but quantum should be able to do the heavy lifting at the private key.   o.0
@_date: 2016-06-14 03:16:16
brother, all you need is the private key to get coins. If my random guesser picks your private address, I don't need to know anything about your address or your public key.
Brute force just tries random strings against a file (or a blockchain) loaded into memory.
I don't need anything to do with your address at all.
@_date: 2016-06-14 08:48:13
bypassing math?
Its the exact same algorithm used today, just a fuckton faster.
under Quantum you would be taking advantage of 'new' math.
right now brute force relies on cycle speed for the most part for it's ability to crack. But we have only had 2 states to work with (on and off).
Now we have 2^300 states to work with.
I can ponder a few possible differential equation tricks to fill up those extra 2^299 boat spaces
If you are getting a fuckton more work per cycle, getting big jobs done becomes realistic  (like guessing a gazzilion private keys)
at the core, you're just moving stacks on and off a register. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 02:56:53
?  data is lost?
You're just blasting tons of these.
@_date: 2016-06-14 10:23:50
with quantum technology, you have 2^300 boat spaces to fit a key attempt per cycle.
vs 2, like today.
@_date: 2016-06-14 19:11:17
You don't know what parallel processing is. 
It's been around since the 80s. Pre multi core
@_date: 2016-06-14 08:47:05
just a faster version of today's computer (chip), is all you need.
@_date: 2016-06-15 03:37:10
are there any links you can recommend?
I would love to know more about this peg board and analog computing technology..
@_date: 2016-06-08 22:29:13
fuck knc
I finally junked my neptunes
I hate those people
@_date: 2016-06-14 02:05:01
that's not a plan  ;)
@_date: 2016-06-14 02:48:03
that's where my brain was going.
but all the users would need quantum devices?
@_date: 2016-06-14 02:29:54
but the technology should be able to brute force keys.
@_date: 2016-06-14 14:20:46
brute force does not care what math you use, because it uses none (other than a random number generator).
It only tries different 'private keys' until it hits a valid one.
@_date: 2016-06-15 01:27:52
if you were relying on cycles like on today's computers with 2 states, it would take a really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really long time.
But, in the quantum world you have 2^n  (last count was 2^300) boat spaces as opposed to 2, like we have now.
By no means have I hammered out a working algorithm, nor do I have a quantum computer to test on. But I can ponder a few tricks with differential equations and ASM to test a fuckton of attempts per cycle using all of those sexy states. Those millions of years to get through a gazzilion private key attempts would shrink a lot.
@_date: 2016-06-14 09:35:48
the ONLY information you need is the key length
you don't even need that, if you don't mind waiting an extra 10000 years
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:20:45
They said a purchase never went thru, which did go thru.
They are full of shit
@_date: 2016-12-16 00:33:49
you don't trust what the company publishes plus you need tax number.
legal notices must go to their documented address of record.

these sons of bitches are on the right path
@_date: 2017-04-16 13:37:28
they are working with minimal horsepower right now.
when that changes, there could be big problems.
@_date: 2017-04-23 01:13:22
I guess thats the moral of the story. Its coming, but it will be a while and there will be plenty of foreplay.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:05:52
Cryptsy left withdraws active until master coin accounts were liquidated.

I had never tried to write to their API before so, I wasn't sure if I was doing something ignorant or not.
Thank you for verifying..
