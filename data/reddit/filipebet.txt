It seems that the guy that supposedly "caught" them doing something, wrote an article about it (that was debunked showing it to be just ridiculous) and now after a few weaknesses were clearly demonstrated about his mixing tool has decided to leave Twitter to "focus on coding". I bet two small pools that freshly arrived into town might have something to do with it...

About *his mixing tool. My mistake.

Roger Ver is the owner of BTC.com and he's using that platform to spread BCH use and awareness. He obviously takes advantage of the fact people land on his website looking for bitcoin.

Long-term term my friend. What we'll need to see is if the platform will be able to fund itself this way. I hope it does u/JezusBakersfield

They literally don't have a bank account and only use bitcoin to run their platform. Now, let's see if it will work.

It seems like a great way to go in and out of lightning. Good addition! Keep up the good work.

Wallets don't do kyc, anyone can use them.

Banks do not need to know your net worth, they do not need to know how much you're thinking of depositing, withdrawing or investing with them and they do not need to know your annual income to open an account for you.

That's only for USA residents, the guy's probably Swedish.

There's one thing that really didn't make sense in what you said, which is about a wallet having insurance over your money. An exchange is custodial, so definitely should be insured, but a wallet has no control over your funds, so I think you're misunderstanding how it works. No insurance would make sense in that case.

Maybe that's the refund transaction that you mention. You saw it in your wallet and immediately spent it to send to Coinbase. But that transaction (the refund one) also has a low fee and zero confirmations, so your transaction to Coinbase won't confirm while the refund transaction isn't confirmed. Ask coinify if they can rbf their transaction with a higher fee. Then you can create a new transaction to Coinbase.

The previous transaction to your address is not confirmed as well. So you basically have the transaction that is funding the address waiting to be confirmed and the transaction spending those funds unconfirmed as well. Those funds basically don't exist until the previous transaction is confirmed. They don't even show up on blockstream.info for example.

Finally! It was long overdue and a welcomed change!
