Fascinating to see an actual Trump supporting, regular t_D poster in the wild. But obviously you're drawn to heavily moderated echo chamber subs like this one. You snowflakes need your safe spaces to protect you from reality.

90% of all cryptocurrencies?
Very very unlikely.

Who the fuck set this thread to auto list comments as controversial? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:35:05
I'm more skeptical of btc for it being on infowars. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:21:06
People are not talking about fees because very few people are actually *using* bitcoin as a currency. Adoption, or rather mainstream interest, have far outpaced the technology.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:09:43
HODL really defies the point of btc.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:06:59
Nobody has IP on bitcoin, it's open source so this comparison doesn't make sense, just a logical fallacy. I like the competition from bch, btc should get its shit together and you guys should stop whining.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:09:44
lol, no.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:35:05
~$20 tx fee and long conf time? No thanks.

OP have you ever used a meme before? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:27:55
This reminds me of when t_D folks and other conservatives threw a hissy fit and boycotted keurig coffee. This sub is such a joke.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:11:53
To be fair, btc is unusable at this time.
@_date: 2019-06-30 11:21:19
This is 100% speculating. Nothing wrong with it, but don't kid yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:34:06
I'm sorry but no. BTC is shit as a currency. The fees that I have to pay to move any amount of btc are more than my monthy fees with conventional banking. At this time bch is a way better currency considered in isolation without all the drama and corruption. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:13:08
You sell your opinion as fact. No point arguing with you,  best to leave it at a disagreement and not waste each other's time. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:55:34
Any chance that upcoming fork can save it? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:12:59
You keep talking about satoshi's vision.. On a post mocking it.. Bch is closer to the original white paper than bitcoin segwit (not that this makes bch better tho) . Anyone else see the irony here? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:13:25
I never said I had to pay 1 BTC in transaction fees?  Please don't comment on and downvote a post your clearly haven't read. 
@_date: 2019-06-20 09:52:41
Is this supposed to be a joke?��
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:50:20
Tried using the "tech" the other day..  Ended up paying more in transaction fees than I was actually transferring and waited more than 30 minutes  for it to confirm. Can't say I'm impressed by the tech.
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:56:22
Okay,  but what about rbitcoin's mod logs being private? That goes against the very fiber of btc in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:08:10
I like bitcoin and own a lot of bitcoin. But I hate this cryptonazi attitude of bitcoiners (specifically this sub,  rbtc is another type of shit show) and their inability to be objective. So I try to challenge that. Can't say I'm surprised that most of the commenters are the tinfoilhat-basement-dwelling-neckbeards types tho. Do you want all those with dissenting opinion to leave? Ask your mods to ban me then,  I heard they have a low threshold for that.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:40:51
Transaction fees are still high as fuck. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:30:04
OP you're an idiot. It's a wallet for btc and bch. Nobody is getting tricked. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:27:28
It read like something from r/iamverysmart
But I understand that moderation is required, I just believe that it should be transparent.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:33:46
Exactly.  
It's like the people on this sub don't understand shit about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:17:29
Did we visit the same bitcoin.com? Because if we did you are full of shit. It has both bitcoin and bitcoin cash and very clearly distinguish between the two.  The only thing hurting btc is this bullshit superiority/xenophobic attitude rbitcoin has. 
Like honestly,  please tell me how bitcoin.com is hurting btc? Because for me,  someone who only owns bitcoin and sold his bch,  it is extra publicity,  extra legitimacy from someone independent of the blockstream corp. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:10:21


Lol.  Dude. Segwit was the new development. So your analogy would mean bch is the "real" btc. 
I don't really give a shit which is the "real"  btc because the fact is that bitcoin segwit was chosen by the market and is thus valued higher. Maybe this will change in the future,  then I'll buy bch,  but this is unlikely. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:15:52
This reminds me of how t_D and r/conservative go on about Clinton. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:03:15
Calling BCash a scam coin is damaging bitcoin as well. Essentially similar tech  still at this point, just different teams with different visions. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:22:16
Emotional investing is rarely a good idea. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:21:41
Petty fools. Hurting btc with your childish tribalism. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:54:33
I had to pay 0.000715 btc fee for sending 0.000545 (~the cost of a 3 cappuccinos) to a friend. If I had done so via eft it would have taken less than 30 minutes and cost a fraction of what I had to pay to send the btc. 
Look I believe in btc,  but if the issue surrounding bitcoin sending fees,  time and reliability are not fixed btc fucked. The tech  of btc is at this moment inferior to many of the other cryptos,  it's just that btc has caught mainstream media attention first. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:36:26
This shit makes me very negative about the future of bitcoin. OP are you a child?
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:56:35
You're not very helpful :/
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:10:45
Why though? It's a wallet that supports both btc and bch. What the fuck is wrong with you people
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:03:09
Yeah,  you're right. Bch overtook eth last month but looks like it is 3rd again
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:25:19
I read your source  but come to different conclusions.
For example,  your definition of cash. I understand that it might be modelled on an older definition (but you have no proof  of this,  I read through Chaums work and digicash white paper) but then why would Satoshi say this in the very introduction? From the btc white paper in the introduction as criticism of the current financial vehicles 


And btc being  modelled on gold? Sure in the sense that there is only a finite amount available and that it is thus deflationary. But in the investment sense that you can't use it for day-to-day tx? Then btc would not be a currency but rather a (tulip) stock. 
(even satoshi thought buying coffee with btc should be possible) 
I don't have the time nor the willpower (especially since I'm on mobile)  to counter every aspect of your very extensive argument. I read it,  but I come to different conclusions reading your sources . The very existence of bitcoin cash is evidence that a lot of other people also came to different conclusions than you. You are too arrogant to consider the possibility that what you see is fact is only your opinion and that it might be wrong. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:45:43
It's a hard fork of Bitcoin that some people think is a truer version of bitcoin than the current segwit "mainstream" bitcoin. But the people here at r/bitcoin think that bch is a Chinese knock off trying to scam people. Read r/btc for another perspective,  keeping in mind that they like bch more than btc. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:25:24
Pure emotional decision. Smart money would have been to hold both since you can't predict the eventual outcome, all you did now was half your chances of success. Also, whats to say that both BCH and BTC won't survive and continue to thrive?
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:35:09
Bitcoin is high risk though, these gains don't come without risk.. Sorry to say OP,  but you were wrong then and you are still wrong now,  regardless of the price of btc.  Also good job on being a cunt about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:33:50
Uhh this meme doesn't mean what you think it does.. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:17:54
If it is a scam,  it sure is one long ass scam.. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:35:20
I forgot that I'm on rbitcoin. Everything that isn't undoubtedly pro bitcoin here is labelled trolling,  shilling,  propaganda or lies and an attack on the one true mastercoin. Lovely echochamber this. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:52:44


Amazing. You guys really are children. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:36:44
Do you have any proof that it is r/btc tho? Why blame them?  And why is the scaling argument getting pushed in this thread.  Smells really fishy. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:02:05
It's a tongue in the cheek meme. Ideas get more ridiculous and stupid as the brain gets bigger/smarter. So according to the correct usage of this mean OP is implying that btc is best meant as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:48:06
I'm not an engineer and I do not know who the fuck these people are that everyone keeps going on about..  What I do know is that when I tried to send bitcoin to a friend a few weeks ago (even before this shitstorm) I paid ~7$ in tx fees and still had to wait 30+ minutes. Which is more expensive and longer than fucking conventional banking. I understand that btc will deviate from the original vision described in the white paper..  But for me if btc can not be used a electronic currency (as intended) it's fucked and that's why I my mind bitcoin cash is the "true" bitcoin. No propaganda shit,  I used both and found that bcash works a whole lot better. Maybe this will change if bcash see the volumes that btc has been dealing with,  I don't know.. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:01:48
You guys are stupidly arrogant. All emotional opinions sold as fact. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:22:46
Did you read more than the headline? To call a difference in opinion propaganda is idiotic. And to see healthy competition as "an attack on bitcoin" which is open source is delusional. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:13:02
I feel the same. Crypto is dominated by a conspiracy mindset and it's really damaging its image and chances of mainstream adoption. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:51:13
I don't like this. Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralised but now you're preaching that there is only one true source where we can get info. Fuck that. Smells real fishy. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:23:03
Much like theymos is a mod here,  at bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:11:59
Completely agree. And bitcoin segwit is winning but somehow this sub still finds a way to complain and call foul play. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:56:30
"Fast peer-to-peer
transactions" 
"Low processing fees"
lol. Also,  the whole point of bitcoin is to be decentralised,  so why the fuck is the same guy moderating that site moderating here and at bitcointalk? u/theymos care to comment
And why not list coinbase? 
I love bitcoin,  but for fucks sake can we just be honest and talk about the real issues instead of sucking blockchains corporate dick
Edit: blockstream 
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:04:43
Pot calling the kettle black. This sub is 90% moon/ath memes, 9% whining about bcash/rbtc and 1% honest discussion about btc. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:51:18
It's the second biggest crypto,  tech similar to btc,  independent team and roadmap etc. 
Despite what rbtc and rbitcoin are preaching,  both will probably continue to grow.. So no reason not to.
Edit: 3rd biggest (after eth and btc) 
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:37:56
Such a rare occurrence that you have to make a post about it.. Why are we celebrating this,  it should be standard. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:29:47
I'm guessing that 90% of bitcoin owners have no idea how to do this. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:34:55
Well you have to keep in mind that most people who go to rbtc are either banned from rbitcoin or disillusioned from the mainstream narrative of bitcoin so there's bound to be a lot more crazy.  
I honestly think it's wise to sub to both,  because it's naïve to think either can be 100% objective and there's likely to be some truth in both subs. 
Another reason to continue to sub to both would be the fact that rbitcoin's mod logs are private whereas rbtc's are public so they are definitely more transparent. 
Example: why do rbitcoin seem to block critical discussions of btc but allow shitposts and memes? [This tread got locked just a couple of hours ago. Why? ](
Also,  the whole point of btc is decentralisation, so there should be multiple platforms with differing opinions. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:20:49
We are talking past each other. Partly because I do not have the technical insight and party because you're very arrogant and seem to lack basic empathy or social insight. 
Thanks for the well written responses, but you have completely failed to change my opinion whatsoever,  your facts simply don't mean what you think it does. 
Bye. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:49:08
I'm responding to this 


As time has gone by,  btc has become shittier; tx time and fee wise. 
That being said,  I sold all my bch and still hold all my btc.  But the other crypto are much better currencies than btc,  btc just has the mainstream attention. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:42:25
I'm not trolling. I'm simply disagreeing with you. 
BitcoinSegwit has become a digital gold,  not a peer to peer electronic cash (as stated in the white paper).  So in that sense,  bitcoin cash is closer to the white paper.  But I agree with the OP of this post,  btc does not necessarily have to follow satoshi's vision. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:37:03
Not trying to refute it,  just pointing out that quoting Trump as a means to support your argument is counter productive. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:44:00
I have 0 interest or stake in bch,  i just think this tribal bs is damaging btc. Take off your tinfoil hat, competition and criticism is healthy.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:48:34
I basically feel the same, except that I foresee BCH continue to grow and become a crypto in it's own right,  independent of btc. But that's just my guess. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:00:09
If you don't give a sort of evidence for your claim you just sound delusional. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:36:25


You sound like a very well known pathological liar. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:46:25
Except that bitcoin cash is truer to the white paper of bitcoin than bitcoin segwit. bch can be used a currency as described in the paper whereas bitcoin segwit has become a store of value due to high tx fees and long confirmation times. Granted segwit had and still has more support from stakeholders,  but does this qualify them to claim IP? Getting IP on bitcoin would defy it's purpose. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:15:24
Btc is turning into a virtual gold (high tx fees and confirmation times) whereas bitcoin cash is still remaining true to the white paper; peer to peer currency. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:03:42
African here, we don't think that.
