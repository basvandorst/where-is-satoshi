if ones belives that his "investment" of couple hundred dollars gonna 
impact "finance" (system?) or actually change BTC - so be it
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:17:09
if couple of hundred is a lot money for said person and if they are gambling it on btc they are retarded. 
There is so much better/smarter stuff to do with 
such cash then play lottery with it.

Never had any issue with Coinbase buying/selling/withdrawing.  
Not holding any on their www tho
