Because a currency isn't legitimate until it is used and not just hoarded.
Yes it is ok to have savings of it, but until most of the people who are "into" bitcoins actually use them as well as save them then it is not a legitimate currency

utilitarian: Designed to be useful or practical rather than attractive
in no way are tulips more valuable than gold from a utilitarian view

aka: it's pretty and desirable
