Me either.. xd
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:44:38
So true. I'm so tired of this shit. Every time something bad happends people tend to create those 'support circle' threads and pretend like everything is fine.
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:15:46
What a moron...
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:19:22
The one has spoken.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:31:14
HAHAH THIS IS ME
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:07:22

Jokes on them. The real ones are on the hard drive somewhere on the landfill.

@_date: 2017-08-29 10:45:20
I wasn't going to tell you anyway.
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:23:30
I did. But I didn't.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:45:45
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:45:54
Partially true.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:46:18
What is wrong with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-10-31 16:55:51
What was so revolutionary about them?
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:35:13
You are all in such a denial.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:45:34
Overvalued you mean.
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:16:17
Could you ELI5 whats ELI5?
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:32:04
Bitcoin is a fraud, dump into fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:32:50
Hang low and buy tight!
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:26:13
Nice! Would buy but have to hodl. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:48:42
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:37:20
This is not how you invest in bitcoin buddy
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:39:27
Don't worry, the first time I bought it dropped around 1.5 the very next day xd
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:45:39
What? No it isn't.
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:10:01
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:30:56
I was asking the same question since it was at 2,2k. I bought at 4.7. Don't make my mistake. If you want to buy, buy now and hold.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:14:35
Leave Elon alone :P
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:28:20
I am using electrum but it’s not 3.0. I guess I should update?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:37:05
That is the best thing I've read in a while xd
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:20:12
This. Well said.
I love bitcoin but this reddit sometimes seems like a messed up cult...
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:38:18


Compound interest :P
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:47:13
I didnt loose, I am around 50% up and still buying whenever I can.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:34:26
This is going to get downvoted by me.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:00:03
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:52:44
I am having a feeling that we will go another 400$ down and back at 7k or more by the end of the weekend.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:25:01
Aaaaaaaaaaaand we're going up again
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:45:05
How do you Vanlife while having kids?xd
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:38:23
Lol, called off haha - thanks for reply anyway :D
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:17:20
Same xd
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:23:35
What the hell is going on? I am at work, slacking as best as I can, watching bitcoinity.org tick and suddenly bang! 200$ up in like a 3 minutes
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:14:40
Same here. And Pubg can be a good looking game at times. :P
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:52:21


I got in at 4.7k. Then it dropped to 3.5k so I bought more and also bought recently at 6.8k. I keep buying because I believe in compound interest and also I know it will go up and in the end I will make some profit but looking at people who got in at 200$ or so I honestly believe that I was too late.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:52:27
Firstly, my point is I will never be up as much as people who invested when it was 100$ or less. At the current rate of price growth I will never even get to a one, full bitcoin. This is why I think I was late.
Secondly, I doubt it will reach any of the prices that people keep talking about like 400 000$ for a BTC. I hope I am wrong with this one.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:30:11




That is great news!
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:09:49
When is it happening? Is it 16th?
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:42:09
I would love to buy some hardware with that. Use it as an actual currency.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:55:48


This is just stupid. It will never happen. Certainly not within 2 or 20 years.
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:11:20


@_date: 2017-11-10 16:29:40


That's life. :)

@_date: 2017-11-17 10:07:34


Give it to me. :P
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:36:54
We were so close xd
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:09:13
Haha it's always funny to watch noobs shit their pants. I mean, I've only been part of this 'rollercoaster' for 3 months but I already learned my lesson and now instead of shitting my pants every time the price drops I take my wallet out and buy more. :P
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:08:05
Idiots in denial...
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:54:10
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:02:53
I hope it's not gonna go down but at least I didn't buy yesterday when it was over 5k. :D
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:00:46
10/10, made my day! God, I was depressed that I bought at 4,7k and didn't sell at 18k - not anymore. xd
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:01:59
Thank god I didn't buy yesterday which was the initial plan but I had no time. :D
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:45:02
Oh that is so good xd
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:53:00
Comedy xd
@_date: 2017-10-11 08:53:39
Oh, ok. Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:43:52
I hope you are right my friend. :D
God, I want to buy more now!
@_date: 2017-09-04 08:17:43
Is it cheaper than localbitcoins tough?
@_date: 2017-10-30 07:59:12
What about electrum wallet? I invested in september and I am still new to that stuff, it will be my first fork.
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:57:30
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:17:21
I have and I failed.
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:15:24
LOL this is so true, I bought my first a month ago when it was at 4.7k and then after a week or so it dropped to 3.3k. That was a bad time for me :D but I didn't sell, I bought more!
@_date: 2018-04-30 16:24:43
I can't imagine anybody owning bitcoin and knowing it's value falling for that xd
@_date: 2017-07-27 14:36:01
Wow! Great work man!
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:26:24
Yeah - right :D
