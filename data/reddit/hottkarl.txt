i don't really understand your post.  if your computer was compromised he could have just as easily been going after one of your bank accounts (e.g. BofA uses 2FA by sending SMS to your phone before letting you do a money transfer).
Google Authenticator generates one time codes and could be used on a tablet or something w/ no phone number.
so it's unclear to me how they suddenly had access to your Coinbase account (knew your credentials) just by getting their # forwarded.

I doubt it's intentional.  They make a killing on fees no matter what the price is.
They're losing money when they can't handle transactions.

the OP said his Coinbase account was compromised: Someone had changed the password and that he was frantically fighting for control of his account.  IMO it sounds like he just forgot his password, got in somehow (how?), but is logged out unexpectedly (im thinking OP changed password then coinbase.com invalidated any sessions/forced him to login again), and/or had some connectivity issues.
correct me if i'm wrong of course but: even if his cell was tied to the GoogleVoice number, calls/txts don't suddenly start bypassing his cell phone or get forwarded to the attacker.  it's the other way around.  ~~specifcally, it lets you make phone calls/txts from Google Voice like they're from OP's cell phone number.~~  don't think this is correct, haven't used Google Voice in awhile and couldn't do this w/o doing stuff on my cell phone
finally, if i was the attacker first thing i'd do is change the email for the coinbase account/takeover email account/change 2FA authentication/security questions
I'm ending it here, could go on and on..
