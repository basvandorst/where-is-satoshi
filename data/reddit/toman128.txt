Thanks for the explanation! I've got the private key stored securely and I'm starting to transfer my funds off of online wallets now that I know they'll be safe in my new wallet. If I had to access the wallet and send from it, what's the most secure way to do so?  
Edit: I'm guessing importing it into blockchain wallet isn't very secure

If I went to bitaddress dot org, downloaded the page offline, disconnected internet, made a randomized wallet and key and stored that info physically, are my funds relatively safe?

I have some money on Japan's biggest bitcoin exchange, and they credited my account with the same number of BCH and I just exchanged it for more bitcoin lol. Coinbase, kraken, etc get on that level

im not following how to do it. the explanation video only shows how to double spend immediately after the transaction, not much later

How do I double spend for a transaction I made in blockchain? It's been like 10 hours and 0 confirmations. I'm trying to find the private key of the address that was used, but am having no luck.

They are only UK based, right? So I can't transfer into US accounts?

Wrong sub lol

Lol yeah no. A regular bank transfer TO your coin base account takes four business days, although they've been slower lately to volume. I don't know about wiring tho. Taking out is only one day.

You mean only 6 billion dollars worth exchanged so far today?

I see this as an opportunity to buy cheap coins at, in your example, 2500 right? I mean the fork guarantees btc price will drop in price whatever bcc is valued at on Aug 1. But afterwards, btc can recover in price because its price will less dependent/independent of bcc, right?

Would the first part of this guide, up to creating the cold storage, be a secure method?

Fast or cheap, pick one. Bank transfer is cheapest, but takes about a week. Debit is fastest but higher fees and lower limits
