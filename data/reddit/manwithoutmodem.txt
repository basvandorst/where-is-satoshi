The first 10 votes matter as much as the next 100 in terms of importance in the ranking algorithm. So seeing a thumbnail and hitting upvote vs. reading an article or self post and then upvoting means that memes are at a ridiculous advantage. The links above detail it a ton if you are interested.

He didn't respond to my argument against memes in reply to his distinguished comment in this thread.

1) is not a default subreddit.
2) They could just require people to post memes inside of self posts. No more karmawhores and no banned content.
3) The voting system on this site is flawed so ridiculously that I don't want to (or know where to) begin.

Pretty much required reading about memes and how they degrade the rest of subreddits:

[Messaging the current admin team]( is probably a better idea than trying to talk to one of the site's creators who doesn't work here anymore, lol.
@_date: 2013-10-16 00:29:55
Not sure who runs that bot and what code it is based off of. Would probably have to ask one of the mods to look at their modlog and see.
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:59:43
I used to mod so I'll weigh in here I guess LOL.
Memes have a ridiculous advantage when it comes to reddit's vote algorithm when they are in a subreddit with various types of content *other than memes.* The first 10 votes on a post count/are worth **just as much as much as the next 100 votes.** With memes, you don't even have to open it most of the time before voting on it which completely which gives it an extremely clear advantage over other content. Compare this to an article, self post, or video. It is minute(s) of watching/reading before you decide to upvote it or not. But guess what? That meme that you can view via thumbnail has 30 upvotes in 1 minute from people taking a quick glance and upvoting. The fluff piles up to the top of the page and the quality content sits below everything else and is more often than not, overlooked in favor of stupid pictures with two lines of text slapped on them telling some type of unfunny joke. 
Reddit's current vote algorithm simply punishes those that post "insightful" or "interesting" content in favor of those that slap impact font on confession bears who are ready for their sweet karma.
If you don't ban them since you want to "go with the spirit of reddit," please consider perhaps a middle ground. Something like a week-long test where memes are to be put in a self post instead of linked directly. Watch as the karmawhores that don't really care about BTC stop clogging up the subredddit (but people that still like memes can still post them!). It will eliminate the karma incentive, it will put it on more even ground with other types of content, and most importantly...**you will not be banning ANYTHING!** It would just be a test and you could revert after a week if you/the community were not happy with it (although I doubt that will be the case).
Please, just try it and give it a chance, it is the only real compromise from your philosophy that you laid out that would work for both sides (just on a trial run as well).
AutoModerator can be configured to do 99% of the work for this. So what do you think?
EDIT, had to respond to a few points quickly:


Is this a joke?


Please tell me you are trolling.


Anyways, uhm...

No, that is your question to the moderator help subreddit. Message the mods of to contact the admins.
Add me as a temp mod (with limited permissions if you don't trust me) like I said in the thread, and I'll set up to clear things up until the admins actually have time to come up with a solution.
EDIT: No one except for the top two mods on the list have the ability to add a new mod or edit a bot config via the wiki. There is still a bunch of submission + comment spam.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:07:33
You too now, heh.
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:07:44
Thoughts on How about If you want another default besides that enforces some high quality (submission) standards - check out (note that the former have high quality submission AND comment standards while EarthPorn has high quality submission standards. In EarthPorn, they don't actively moderate comments as it is a photography subreddit haha.)
Please listen to reason here.

AutoModerator works for free and removes memes automatically pretty well ya' know. Making it a rule and letting the bot take care of it shouldn't be hard. :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:27:03
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:37:02
They need to hire and I to kill the memes IMO.
@_date: 2013-10-15 23:59:36
Nah, JordanTheBrobot AFAIK just removes link shorteners and warns people of flash .swf files.
@_date: 2013-10-15 23:34:45
kn0thing hasn't worked for reddit in like 5 years.
@_date: 2013-10-15 23:34:23
JordanTheBrobot can't really do anything.

top kek
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:34:33
so brave
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:51:53


Because it isn't a default subreddit like and it is designed to not be a subreddit that has the traffic of a default? Yeah, that is why.
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:33:15
Literally skeen.
@_date: 2013-10-15 23:23:56
Yep, you would do this in the wiki to remove all submissions and comments by users with accounts less than 24 hours old:
    user_conditions:
        account_age: "&lt; 1"
    action: remove
@_date: 2013-10-15 23:34:03
Spammers already do this in large default subreddits and there are ways to fight them with AutoModerator.
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:34:18
Moderation hasn't stepped up to removing bad posts either.

is not that great unfortunately, bad choice for a good default subreddit example to give to him there lol. is the good one.
@_date: 2013-10-16 00:23:48
Only the top two moderators have the ability to invite new mods and have given all of the mods below them extremely limited mod permissions. And the top two mods seem to missing.

Thank you for doing this.

He's an admin and he goes by I have talked to him about the bot.
Add the account as a mod (no mail/config/access/flair permissions required), then create a new wiki page at then make the page private mod view only, then type the following:
 If you update this page, you must [click this link, then click "send"]( to have AutoModerator load the new rules.
    standard: meme generator sites
    action: remove
It's that easy. You could add me with wiki permissions for 5 minutes and then remove me and I could have it set up and ready to go for you.
**EDIT:** You already have on [your modlist.](Just go to and put:
    standard: meme generator sites
    action: remove
And then update the bot. :)
