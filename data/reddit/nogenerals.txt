Smart contracts can be viewed as fee-backed notes/assets. Anything that is tied to the Bitcoin blockchain such as LN with payment channels or sidechains with atomic swaps basically represents notes redeemable for bitcoin.

Just migrate to POS already! 
@_date: 2015-12-18 15:11:49
But I know you mean that they can just change their code at will. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:04:24
I have no problem with LN. None at all. And I'm am fairly agnostic on the block size debate because I believe no matter what the blocksize is, it is inevitable that Bitcoin will eventually 'just' do settlement because of the constraints of decentralisation. Sidechains (if they work) and LN (if they are work) would advance Bitcoin enormously. 
The only real problem I have with anything in the Bitcoin space is that nobody dares question POW. It's far too expensive and wasteful for what it does. A migration to proof-of-stake is the only real hard fork Bitcoin needs.

Notice how he also acknowledges that POS is a likely improvement on POW:
"Your objection does suggest to me an interesting possible improvement in the Byzantine agreement security. Instead of, or in addition to, the Byzantine "voting power in case of civil war" going to those proving work (i.e. the miners), require that participants sign challenges with their ownership keys to prove they own solution bits. The behavior of conflicting sending nodes, when the receiving node can't otherwise distinguish between correct and incorrect behavior, then gets weighted by the value of solution bits owned by said sender, either par or market, or similar. With such method one would have to own most of the money in circulation, rather than just most of the mining power, to corrupt the system (i.e. to successfully attack the subset of features that only have a Byzantine rather than cryptographic level of protection). This would discourage anonymity since doing these signatures and verifications over many keys would get computationally intensive, but I don't think strong anonymity is a feasible property in bit gold or Bitcoin anyway."

The incremental changes in blocksize mean bitcoin retains ability to do what it does best - big payments. No other currency will likely ever be able to do this better than bitcoin. The likes of safecoin will likely usurp it for the illicit stuff - just like the safe network will likely usurp TOR - and ether is superior to it in many other ways but the market value of bitcoin means it is on a trajectory to become a settlement system for big stuff. Satoshi knew this very soon after he made it. Most likely even beforehand. The technological constrainsts of decentralisation are clear. There's no point in fighting them. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 12:48:05
I'm not a central planner. I'm totally agnostic on the block size debate because if it is by design or the free market, the outcome will be the same. Security and decentralisation will never be sacrificed, thus bitcoin will never be good at doing day-to-day cash. Satoshi himself - for what it's worth - acknowledged this. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:31:25
I'm using the blockchain as a timestamping service to remove the possibility of fraud in a p2p pay-per-view market place I want to build off chain. I won't say any more at this point :)
@_date: 2015-12-30 13:26:57
Thought so. But the economic trajectory is the same none-the-less and people don't actually use bitcoin for any application beyond speculation and darknet drug markets hence why I've stopped caring about the block size debate. Aside from TX fees, the costs (not just financial) in acquiring bitcoin render it fairly useless as a day-to-day currency. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 22:36:02
It's not just that. Consensus takes time. It's inefficient. But it's ultra secure and trustless. So for small instant payments, no matter what the size of the blockchain is, it's not very useful. It'd be more feasible if Bitcoin took the sensible step to move to POS, but that has never been seriously considered. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 15:08:32
Thanks. They've got something to say about those attacks. And their front end code is open source. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:27:15
Will take a look, thanks. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:57:16
Chill out. You're getting caught up on symantics. My point still stands - LN or a sidechain for micropayments then. Sidechains with tokens created by atomic swaps are essentially bitcoins too you know. I was talking about the Bitcoin blockchain. It can't - and never will be able to - handle day-to-day money payments. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 13:14:00
Before you go, how is bitcoin economics being changed?
@_date: 2015-12-31 00:20:49
Yes that's pretty much what I said :)
@_date: 2015-12-22 23:26:50
Of course it does but the unfalsifiable information means transgressions such as these can easily be enforced. There's no hiding on a blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 12:44:47
People will be buying their coffee with a sidechain derivative of bitcoin (eg, the LN). But not bitcoin itself. So yes, I agree that the blockchain is will be lowest settlement layer. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:46:14
You're pissing against the wind. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 20:22:51
Yes, there'll be a token. I'd imagine it works just like Bitcoin but instead of POW, probably POS - as in a variant of POS which means as long as you're allowed into the club, you get to validate TXs. There's probably a fixed amount of tokens from day 1 with no more released as there's no need to incentivise the validators in this club.
It is undoubtedly a walled garden, and while these have generally failed in internet history, I believe R3CEV will last a long time. This is not because it's better than Bitcoin or more appropriately, Ethereum (which is better than Bitcoin) but because of the existence of Fiat. As long as people have to pay taxes in Fiat, banks will remain the biggest business on the planet. Thus, even their private blockchain will significantly dwarf open chains like the ones I mentioned. 
To give an example, if you live in Australia and want to send your sister in France $1000, you're going to do it through your bank and not sign up on a bitcoin exchange, pay trade fees, then send to your sister who must do the same - all the while exposed to the volatility risk. If Bitcoin was more mateur, it'd be more stable, but until we can spend BTC in restaurants and pubs, etc - which is a long ways off - private chains will rule in finance. 
On the other hand, public chains like Ethereum, will succeed in other nascent industries made popular by blockchain technology.

"As for the long transaction delay and poor scalability, I long considered bit gold as a design for "high-powered money" that like gold could be used as an investment vehicle, a medium for large transactions, and a reserve currency against which digital notes could be issued. It would be however be far more securely auditable than remote gold vaults. If you're right on this critique Bitcoin may be destined to become a high-powered money rather than a day-to-day payment system for the masses"
@_date: 2015-12-31 00:59:14
You've just described what Nick described in 2011. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 14:55:49
You beat me to writing the same thing. It can't be hot-wired one way if it is already that way by design. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 12:15:33
No matter what, there has to be a roadmap to scale it up. What is accepted by most is that, bitcoin will never be a general purpose currency and thus there's little point in increasing blocksize before capacity requires it.
Basically if we won't be able to use bitcoin to buy a coffee in 2060, why would we start using it to do so now? The focus is to ensure bitcoin remains doing what it does best: high-value transactions. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 13:00:05
Decentralisation is the issue. Of course it is. People are afraid of losing it, hence the conservatism. Without its decentralisation, Bitcoin is nothing. If the block size is too small, or too large, you get centralisation - well you certainly do in the latter case. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:14:56
Either I read his previous post where he said he was finishing with the thread or I am Nostradamus. You decide.

It was always hot-wired as such. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 16:18:06
I think you misunderstood me. I believe there is a token for the transferral of value between banks. The purpose of R3CEV is to remove clearing houses from the banking equation no? They will settle interbank payments amongst themselves. 
I clearly stated that I don't believe there will be mining or any rewards involved. But what is required is that they all act as validators (so in a way it would be POS because everyone who has a stake in the system acts as a validator). 
I do admit though that I am not aufait with actual plans of R3CEV. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:25:40
I'm asking as I want to set up an online blockchain-based service (for a non-financial use case) and I think it'd work in a similar way. Security is important and I'm just wondering how I can guarantee it. Even if you're not dealing with money, privacy is everything. 
I don't actually keep any coins on blockchain.info. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:03:42
The early adopters were both of these things. People who didn't understand the tech nor the Austrian perspective on money, didn't get Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 01:53:08
I agree but since Nick is the Godfather of smart contracts - coining the phrase in 1993 - and, eh, ahem, the blockchain, I don't think Nick ever envisaged a trusted system either. Sure where did the scripting that LN is availing of come from? ;) 
@_date: 2015-12-31 02:06:00
Yes that's a great solution. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 01:00:21
No, you're the one not using context. He said he didn't mean it couldn't be used as money - only that it wouldn't be day to day money. The other commenter reduced Bitcoin to merely an investment vehicle. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 15:10:34
Since it is a gas limit and not a block size limit, I'm struggling to see the incentives to spam here. Just watched Jeff's presentation above. Ethereum is most like BIP 106 which he found interesting. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 19:05:59
There is zero greed, maximum agnosticism in the Ethereum development process. A breath of fresh air. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 18:31:03
And those 256 will be those who post the largest bonds? 
@_date: 2016-01-03 14:02:27
I'm loathe to ask why it creates incentives to spam blocks considering your depiction of POS is so ludacris. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 10:46:18
Of course. Why wouldn't there be? 
@_date: 2016-01-03 17:00:55
Yes because of the bond. There's something at stake. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:01:04
He's been around for years and has contributed, and is continuing to contribute, a huge amount to the development of this field. Your slander is backed up with zero evidence. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 14:38:31
No. But the block size must still increase as the network grows. And a small group of people - the core developers - (a much more centralised group than the miners in Ethereum) have de facto control of this. At least it's safe to say this group doesn't collude :) 
@_date: 2016-01-03 14:47:55
I didn't say they wouldn't. I was talking about core developers not colluding - a reference to all the infighting. I'm well aware Bitcoin is open source but I used the words 'de facto' because we all know whatever core puts out, is Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 14:17:57
OK. And how is this different to a situation (like we have now) in Bitcoin where the block size limit is above the average block size? The only difference I see is that Ethereum is dynamic whereas Bitcoin requires hard forks to change. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 23:32:05
and that's all that matters isn't it?
@_date: 2016-01-03 16:38:49
I think in the Ethereum system, the users decide as much as the miners do.
There's nothing trusted about bonded POS. There's something at stake. A 51% attack is far costlier than it is in POW. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 16:07:38
Bitcoin is Western Union without profits. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 14:24:21
How does that example not apply to Bitcoin?
