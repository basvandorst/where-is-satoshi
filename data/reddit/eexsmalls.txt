The 2013 BTC bubble was a way sharper spike up. This one saw steady increases before the spike. It will drop again, but not as low. And there will be probably be another bull run in the future that brings it even higher
Also ETH is a whole different animal due to the Enterprise applications, and proof of stake looming.

Did everyone read the article? Its talking about another lending/mortgage bubble. Not saying price of bitcoin wouldn't be affected at all, but its not the focus of this article.

If coinbase goes down the whole crypto market plummets in unbelievable fashion. It is the most visible, accessible, and arguably most trusted exchange. Even though our coins are stored offline, we're only slightly less fucked in that scenario.

Most people are long term holders (AKA hodlers) here. Only put it what you can afford to lose, its still a gamble.

I feel like a broken record, but I'll keep saying it, we are ALL fucked if one of the ultra-major exchanges are compromised. The media will eat crypto alive and the market will tank 100x harder than it did after Mt Gox. Sure our coins will be safe but they will also be heavily depreciated in value if not worthless.

You've certainly studied up on your buzzwords, but do you care to elaborate on this?
You are partially correct, some jobs will be automated. Jobs with narrow, predictable scopes such as driving, assembling goods to an exact specification, and performing basic actions that can be entirely scoped into a data set (with no risk of irreconcilable adversity i.e. low entropy) are at risk.
However, In the software industry, many are shying away from the term "artificial intelligence" because it has turned out to be misleading to a few too many laymen. A more accurate description is software capable of making a limited set of decisions in adherence with a model trained on a particular dataset (AKA machine learning). It will still take a handful of unprecedented breakthroughs to get to the point where we have established enough "artificial intelligence" to decimate the labor force as you describe. Smart money is already moving towards innovations that allow machine learning techniques to supplement human labor, not replace it. Believing that software is entirely without strict limitations is a symptom of being software illiterate, and I recommend studying up before speculating about the future.
If I come off as condescending, I'm only mirroring a fraction of your tone.
