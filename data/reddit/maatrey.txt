How come you're deviating away from the commonly accepted "easy way to explain Bitcoin" ?
I'd use the same phrases that are commonly used:
Banks hold a ledger that contains a record of all transactions to and from their accounts.
Bitcoin has a public ledger that can be looked at - but users are not necessarily identifiable.
When a bank sends funds from your account to another account, your bank sends a message to the receiving bank saying, "My client has £100. He is sending £100 to your client. We guarantee the funds will arrive".
When you send Bitcoins, you send a message to a network of computers saying, "I have these bitcoins, and I am sending them to my friend." A network of computers then verifies that the sender actually has the funds, and is eligible to transfer them. Once verified, the receiver can spend the funds.

I'm sorry, but I wouldn't trust a company in India with any of my funds. That is nothing against you, or me being racist - but I'm just afraid that I:
a) don't understand India's laws in relation to companies
b) don't understand compliance laws in India
I'd only trust my bitcoins with a UK vendor of debit cards - and that's purely because I know we operate stringent compliance laws.

The problem is, and always will be, the rise of Bitcoin difficulty and halving of BTC reward.
Let's say I buy a toaster today that pays for itself in terms of electric costs. Suddenly, the cost of making toast is free in terms of electricity - and it might even make me $0.01 profit a year too.
When difficulty rises, this toaster now starts to cost me money. I've already paid a premium for it over a normal Toaster, but now my Bitcoin toaster is only covering 80% of electricity. Soon, that lowers to 0% of electricity and suddenly I am actually paying over-the-odds electricity for a piece of toast.
Within 5-years, I'll come to the conclusion that turning  on my BTC toaster will make me bankrupt, and hire a bankruptcy lawyer to prepare for the inevitable as I want my morning toast.

The link showing is:
Can I suggest you add your registered business number, address and names of your directors/CEO's? Without transparency, you can't expect an open source community to adopt :)

Thanks, but I'd still prefer to buy a Raspberry Pi and a Bitmain AntMiner U3 63 gh/s USB miner from Amazon. 
Whatever way you look at it, 21 released a device, and marketed a device, that is aimed at senior programmers who can see benefit from it. Myself, as a geeky digital marketing nerd, but non programmer, see absolutely no benefits of 21 Inc's product.
As such, I now feel that 21 Inc produces worthless products - which has damaged their reputation for me as a buyer.
21 Inc employed the worst marketing known to man. They spread the news in consumer channels, and got hurt because of it. They should of went semi-private and reached out to developers privately. When the technology arrives and is "successful", the news would trickle out and 21 Inc would be an overnight success.
Hey 21 Inc, you need a Digital Marketing Manager? Hit me up!
Edit: What makes it worse is that everybody had very high expectations from 21. We'd see them mining the occasional block, and be like, "Wow, who is this 21 company really? Are they gunna make something amazing?" The continuous stream of publicity they received from speculating consumers was amazing. They went and blew it with a non-consumer focused product, with absolutely no initial and immediate benefits.

Pretty sure my stash of 20 bitcoins would turn me into an overnight millionaire. Oh wait, our objective IS to achieve this, right?
When can I expect to become a millionaire?

Your phone number on the site is confusing. While it says (54), if you click it, Skype takes it as a +91 (India). My apologies.

Pretty sure this one line can be applied to any aspect of life and used as great advice.
"I don't speculate on my wages. I don't calculate my wages. I just try to focus on doing the job."

Pretty sure that we'll all be buying Virtual Prostitutes with Virtual Currency in the next 20-years. A prostitute will magically exit through our super high resolution 8D monitors, and we'll instantly send 0.01 bitcoin for an hours session.

I sure hope so. I'm in for a tight month next month. If we can get BTC globally accepted by two weeks, I'll be sorted.

These people need to realize that the only way out of this mess is to come clean with their wives or relevant partners. Any blackmailer is going to return for more funds when they run out - it's easy cash.
If I could blackmail you today, then I'll blackmail you with the same info 1-year from now for more cash. 
There's a reason our governments don't pay ransoms - and it's not only down to principles, but it actually prevents such situations occurring. If nobody paid a random, nobody would request them. Once these extortionists blackmail one person, they will continue to do it over and over again.
With that said, if anybody feels obliged to give in to keep their past hidden, I would suggest:
a) requesting the blackmailers personal info
b) doing a traceable payment such as WU
c) do a face-to-face meet where possible
I'm not condoning ransoms by any means, but merely trying to prevent any victims from being blackmailed ~again~ in 1-month; which will happen.
But still, I'd prefer that people just came ~clean~ about their past mistakes if their relationships really much so much to them. And with that, I agree with OP. Any vendors should not sell their bitcoins to victims. You have a responsibility to protect victims, even if that just is morally.

HELL YEAH! All of those worldwide banks are so eager to adopt Citicoin that they're pouring tens of millions in investments into pre-buying Citicoins. After all, competing banks want to ~lose~ market share to Citibank, and promote another banks technology.
Let the banks fight. Let the banks spend billions on digital currency advertising. Let the banks bring all of the up-and-coming teenagers into the world of crypto currency. In the end, the majority will see the light, and we'll be sat here, talking about the rally to the moon.

This dude is so annoying. It's like he has no idea what he's talking about, and reading from a piece of paper, while simultaneously thinking, "What is this **** I'm reading?".
Sorry if it's you dude, but you need to get some self-confidence and speak with enthusiasm!

Yeah! Fuck those $0.24 fees. When my bank charges me £1 + 1.5% just for buying something in USD, it's really time to get fucking pissed when a bitcoin provider charges $0.24.
