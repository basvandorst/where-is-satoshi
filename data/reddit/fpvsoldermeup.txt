I can't vouch for the wallet,  but  is one of the lead developers (it seems) and is one of the open-source proponents in the bitcoin JavaScript community.

Mycelium uses a different derivation schema... BIP44 :/

Nodes are important,  for exactly the reasons you state,  but they also exercise your own political will.
See  for a discussion I had in regards to this.
@_date: 2017-02-16 01:53:03
How did you mess up the fee?
Were you forming it yourself manually via a command line or something?
@_date: 2017-02-09 00:06:20
The discussion of larger blocks wasn't being censored,  the discussion of support for clients which were aggressively suggesting a hard-fork without economic consensus, review or even long-standing discussion in the existing development communities, was being censored.
@_date: 2017-02-14 05:16:28
So,  to clarify.




And the difference was only 1 word between the two?
That is classic and hilarious,  and a prime example of how the BIP39 checksum is terrible.
@_date: 2017-02-15 06:54:21
Maybe I'm losing something in translation.
Did the application warn you that it was an invalid mnemonic?
Does it usually warn you?
I'm asking because BIP39 specifically does a "checksum" which should have warned you that there was a problem.
@_date: 2017-02-06 04:42:09
Nodes are the consensus.
See here for a [balanced discussion](
@_date: 2017-02-06 04:56:59
Use both!
The hard-wallet for keeping/using private keys,  and a compatible fancy wallet for forming transactions as they get more complicated.
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:57:43
Probably don't buy from bitmain.   They don't support segwit [yet?].
@_date: 2017-02-14 01:42:52
Someone should run a simulation that shows miner profits after a hard-fork to 4MB vs SegWit.
@_date: 2017-02-03 11:18:17
it'll be interesting to see what happens then :)
@_date: 2017-02-14 21:52:24
But,  the checksum was correct for both?!
@_date: 2017-02-27 01:44:44
There is 1 private key,  with 2 derived public keys (uncompressed, compressed),  and an address for each public key.
Compressed public keys are the most common standard now-a-days.
@_date: 2017-02-26 03:11:26
I think was referring to a statement commonly "cited" where mentioned the amount of controversy surrounding bitcoin helps make it stronger.
I don't have a source.
@_date: 2017-02-06 04:34:18
You could save on fees by combining payments into 1 transaction.
Also,  this is more like "living *through* bitcoin".
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:00:32
Not to mention you'd need to find the double pre-image due to the hashing function in BTC typically being `SHA256(SHA256(x))`,  instead of just `SHA256(x)`.
@_date: 2017-02-14 00:43:06
If you don't mind me asking:
* Did the original 24 words have a valid checksum?
* Did the "fixed" 24 words have a valid checksum?

Users would come first,  then businesses

Wallet support was difficult.  You needed a custom full node,  trusted or owned.
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:32:54
Whatever you do,  back up/copy the `wallet.dat` first,  in case something bad happens.

Time is irrelevant here,  fee's have no relationship with time,  only inclusion in blocks (which hopefully maintains an economically based, rational incentive).
For a given duration,  if the number of transactions [with a fee higher than yours] in the [mining nodes] mempool exceeds the maximum block size,  you can be certain you will not be included in the next block [for the given duration].
@_date: 2017-01-09 11:05:23
How is it a complicated solution?
I see this written,  but nothing backs it up.
The idea and execution is pretty simple...

Way to go guys!
@_date: 2017-01-14 22:53:25
Please re-submit but without the scientific notation,  and instead using number of blocks instead of time :).
@_date: 2017-01-25 04:46:28
to be honest,  you're reply to the OP above doesn't emphasise how absurd that is.

No,  according to the bitcoin economic consensus,  the problem isn't urgent enough to decide either way.
Bitcoin core has proposed segregated witness as a scaling solution,  it has not yet been accepted by the economic consensus.
@_date: 2016-12-19 20:36:29


This is 100% correct,  but you're confusing `longest chain` to mean just *any* chain that has the proof-of-work behind it.
It has to be a valid chain,  that is, conforming to the rules of bitcoin.
The miners have no power in changing this,  as nodes reject any blocks not conforming to their rules.
Miners simply choose transactions for inclusion in the next block [and get paid for it].
@_date: 2016-12-20 19:54:33
Where did you read it didn't relay blocks?
@_date: 2016-12-19 20:38:08
How would you stop it without creating perverse incentives for miners to just fill the blocks with pointless transactions?
@_date: 2016-11-14 10:35:27
Then we agree :).  I said it reveals all derived keys,  not that it reveals keys up the hierarchy.
@_date: 2016-12-19 20:27:28


That will happen,  but for it to mean anything, it is probably 2-3 halvings away,  that is 8-12 years.
At which point, fees (and transactions) would be the **only** way to mine economically, and as a result,  will be the sole incentive to avoid empty blocks.
SegWit would also help reduce the bloat,  enabling more transactions in less space (therefore potentially more fees).
@_date: 2016-12-23 00:07:51
One of the hardest parts with BIP47 is,  like all ECDH solutions, keeping the notification off-chain.
What were your thoughts on a solution similar to joinmarket, aka maybe using a service like IRC to start getting more complex output/redeem script negotiations between wallets?
But in a way that doesn't let 3rd parties feel like they are relying on a potentially malicious service provider.
I know IRC sucks,  but,  it would set the stage for a potentially better solution/network in the future.
@_date: 2016-12-15 21:44:20
What do you need as part of that API,  out of interest 
@_date: 2016-12-15 01:09:22
SegWit is more like encouraging people driving trucks to instead use motorcycles because it means we can fit more people on the road.
For the record,  that is the only part of the analogy that holds (nothing to do with safety).

VISA doesn't control the money supply... so including the mining subsidy seems a bit off in the comparison.

@_date: 2016-12-22 22:26:19
Just watch out with BIP75,  the authors (NetKi) are pro integrating it with banks and KYC/KML,  and some of the discussion on the mailing list mentioned that the protocol was designed for that.
It is great in theory, but it is an enabler for transaction censorship.

Revealing an xpub to anyone is a high security risk,  for the following reasons:
* The reveal of any 1 child private key,  to someone who also knows the `xpub`,  will reveal **ALL** private keys for every other child key derived from that `xpub`.^[1](


* The reveal of `xpub` naturally reveals all children public keys.  This is terrible for privacy,  but it may be something you're willing to compromise on for a service.
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:41:31
How would you steal SegWit coins after a reorg?
Or are you referring to the period after activation where a re-org could rewind activation but keep the signatures?
@_date: 2016-12-21 22:19:35
Oh,  I think it was just a mis-alignment of our definition of validation.
For me, validation is the node verifying that transaction is valid and does not break the rules of bitcoin.
For you,  I think,  validation represents the process of a transaction becoming solidified in bitcoin's history as being a transaction that occurred?
@_date: 2016-12-15 04:39:08
Wouldn't it be a hard-fork if my client ignored blocks that didn't have the witness commitment?
(and if it allowed a transaction which was missing witness data?)

Wouldnt the attacker need the parent extended public keys for that?

57 satoshis/byte is the median fee for the last 10 blocks,  59 satoshis/byte for the last 1440 (2 weeks).
52 satoshis/byte was perfectly fine,  it just took a little longer than usual.

Miners do not necessarily validate transactions.
The only incentive they have to do that is to ensure they don't produce an invalid block.
Miners merely **select** transactions to include in a block.
That, and generating bitcoin, is their only role.
@_date: 2016-12-19 23:26:07
You were only downloading.
Not uploading.
You don't even count as a node on the network by most measures.

Assuming you believe bitbet.us will still be there,  and gambling is legal, and you have BTC to lock up for 10 months... and and and.     No ,  the only reason someone isnt betting against this isnt because they dont want to put their money where their mouth is.
@_date: 2016-12-19 20:12:39
You should't stop running your nodes in protest.   You should instead push for a mining algorithm fork... if that is indeed your protest.
Empty blocks are as intended... if the fees aren't motivation to mine... then we can't expect the system to uphold itself.
@_date: 2016-12-21 21:42:52
Pay high fee transactions and lobby your wallet of choice to [allow] only broadcasting transactions directly to SegWit supporting miners... but resorting to that has a lot of bad implications for the general community and may not even work.
So maybe don't do that yet.
@_date: 2016-12-20 00:10:41
At an average of 144 blocks per day, and say 30 days per month.
That is [currently][a maximum of] 4320MiB, per month, downloading.
Even with `blocksonly`, you still weren't uploading.
Otherwise,  I agree with you,  it certainly is possible to rate limit these things,  its just not reasonable to say you're "helping the network" if you're taking more than you're giving back (strictly from a bandwidth point of view).
@_date: 2016-11-04 01:47:13
Beside a few small changes in 2015,  I don't think J.Garzik has contributed any code to bitcoin core for a while now.[^1](

You can directly send your transaction to some miners.
It is absolutely possibly they may relay that transaction to the network.
But they may not.

Address re-use is discouraged,  so this probably won't have any technical legs to stand on.

@_date: 2016-12-15 05:18:30
OK,  true.


To enforce this,  I'd have to be rejecting these blocks.
After which,  I'd be left dead in the water if I was the only one doing this,  so the end result is still that I'd be living on my own chain?
@_date: 2016-11-27 23:51:28
P2SH segwit addresses are by no means optimal,  they are just a placeholder.
After activation,  it won't take long for the community to just use P2WPKH instead.
@_date: 2016-11-28 03:31:00
If all transactions were pay-to-pub-key-hash (P2PKH),  and all transactions were 1 input to 1 output,  then each transaction would be 191 bytes.
A maximum of ~**5489** transactions per 1MB block.
Under Segregated Witness,  using P2WPKH, that same transaction would be 82 bytes.
A maximum of **12787** transactions per 1MB block.
However, Segregated Witness doesn't just *lose* that data, it is accosted elsewhere [using a different,  4MB limit,  called "block weight"](
Taking this into account,  our real "maximum" is **actually ~9664 transactions per 1MB block.**
This ratio is about `1.76`,  aka, that infamous "1.7" multiplier you see around the place.
*All of the above is in perfectly ideal conditions.*
Paging to verify the above?

Mempool and mempool relay - but it doenst sound like he uploaded to many peers.  
@_date: 2016-12-21 21:39:56
Could we bypass the miners by having a commitment relay network which we could store separately to the block?
@_date: 2016-12-18 23:02:27
Except that doesn't validate the [transactions in the] **blockchain**.
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:43:28
what were your thoughts on empty blocks, e.g where including transactions is not worthwhile due to a non-substantial fee market?
Why include transactions if the increasing bitcoin price can cover mining costs with a higher consistency?

@_date: 2016-12-20 00:13:27


`blocksonly` isn't download only,  it just doesn't relay transactions.
@_date: 2016-10-18 02:51:31
Sure,  but that is why you typically reason about fees in terms of "fee rate",  not the actual fee paid.
The smaller you can make the size of the transaction,  the less fee actually paid.
The median fee rate for the last 10 blocks has been 50 satoshis / byte,  with a lower IQR of 34 and an upper IQR of 55.
The lower IQR for last 1440 blocks has been about 48 satoshis / byte.
For a 255 byte transaction, at say 48 satoshis / byte,  that is 0.08$ USD,  for 800 bytes,  ~0.25$ USD.
It gives the wrong impression if you say `$0.28/transaction`,  because a transaction has varying degrees of size and therefore, appropriate fees.
@_date: 2016-10-04 01:44:35


That isn't even close to what you could call high volume.
@_date: 2016-10-18 02:14:43
That is 2-3 times larger than an average per-user wallets transaction.
I wouldn't say it is representative [of those complaining about fees],  but still interesting.
@_date: 2016-05-22 23:52:14
That would be subject to the inputs being spent before the nLockTime passes,  a non issue with CLTV.

Looks great!  I'd say try and aim for a more flat project structure though,  for projects of this size where readability [without an IDE] is key,  the flatter the better.
Centralized complexity is good, provided you don't overload that centralization with too many responsibilities (see, bitcoin core and its "main" file).

Could you post the link?   I run a UAcomment because I couldn't find any reputable BIP148 source/repo... let alone with those signatures.
