Of the 506 banks on that list, 481 of them were acquired by other banks &amp; financial institutions which as a result saved virtually every single dollar deposited into any of them. The other remaining 25 were acquired by no one and had their depositors receive FDIC payouts at a maximum of $250,000 per account. Virtually no one lost money as a result of this. Note that most of the failures were a result of pressure from the financial crises. In the 5 years prior to 2008, there were only 10 bank failures.
When Mt. Gox "failed", 850,000 coins disappeared. Since then, with a lot of effort applied, 200,000 coins were "found". In other words, ~650,000(~$148 million today's rates) coins remain lost in the depths of the world wide web. That's 650,000 of the 14 million coins that exist today. In other words, one company destroyed 4.6% of the "bitcoin economy". 
Could you imagine BNY Mellon losing 4.6% of all of the assets it has in their custody?...

Bitcoin can certainly grow its market capitalization. The only problem is that it needs some money poured into it. The bitcoin market cap. surpassed $10 billion at one point but collapsed around the time of the Mt. Gox incident which occurred conveniently around the time when all the big holders were cashing out(after the price began to dip from its $1,000 peak).
There is plenty assets available to make bitcoin big. But besides venture capital funding for startups, money hasn't exactly been flying into bitcoin itself. Nobody is really using the coin to purchase anything either as BitPay revealed yesterday with their financial statistics. Maybe one of the trillionaire armchair economists of can pour a smooth $4 billion into bitcoin?

I have traveled to the Dominican Republic and so has much of my entire family. I have also traveled to Jamaica, Bahamas, Saint Martin, Canada, Mexico, England... I haven't had any problems. It also seems as if most aren't having problems because credit card companies are doing nothing but growing and so is their usage.

What pizzeria in New York does not have a credit card machine? Every single pizzeria I have ever been a customer of, especially in Manhattan, has a credit card machine. Even the more beaten down joints. The ones that didn't have a credit card machine has ATM machines where you could deposit a $10 bill and pay for your food.
And if the pizzeria has neither, this would likely be a result of the fact that said pizzeria does not receive enough credit card transaction requests to justify its implementation. If you haven't notice, people almost always pay with cash at any pizza joint. Crooked bills and all.

I have been to Berlin numerous times. I have family that is spending the rest of their lives in this town. This adoption your talking about doesn't exist outside of your head. Where the hell do you even live? Because it certainly isn't Berlin. And if you do, you don't need to lie to yourself.

I like the comment of the person who responded to you:


I had trouble finding where ShadowStats gets its numbers in this case, but I know it has received a lot of criticism in the past. It certainly faces far less oversight than does the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Further, the allegation that the modification was meant to make unemployment look better is dubious: it caused a transparent, essentially constant offset up until the most recent recession. If deception was the intent, the officials certainly displayed considerable foresight in 1994.
The real median household income trend you linked is less hopeful than mine, though I'm not quite sure how to resolve the discrepancy. However, even if we use your data, the decline/stagnation is easily explained by the baby boomers. The trend in household income is very similar to the trend of the labor force participation rate.
Among middle class households, the home is usually one of the largest components of net worth, and given that housing prices underwent what is universally recognized as a bubble, I don't think the decline in median household net worth is so surprising or particularly ill-boding. And demographic changes are once again a factor as well, as the elderly do the most dissaving.
The trend in small business ownership rate is hard to make out from the three data points provided, but while I'm sure the recession played a part in the recent decline, the growth of corporations could easily be the cause of the overall trend. I believe that the rate of small business ownership is least explicitly tied to economic well-being of all the metrics we've thus far discussed.
Do I see economic indicators that are cause for distress? Didn't I just mention several?
I had come across different versions of the metrics you discussed which I did not find alarming, and was hence asking whether there were other metrics or different versions that you found alarming. You've now provided them, and I agree that they at first appear disturbing, but I believe that analysis reveals they are much less awful than they seem.
It doesn't bother you that we're printing TRILLIONS of dollars since 2008--the same sort of bullshit that has destroyed dozens of fiat based financial systems the last hundred years--
The expectation that quantitative easing will bring hyperinflation is simplistic and erroneous. The monetary base has increased 4-5 times, and we have experienced minimal inflation. The sharp growth of the MB money supply is often trumpeted as some harbinger of doom when it is really nothing of the sort.
and we have nothing to show for it but greater wealth disparity?
As you saw above, I dispute this. And even if I did not, it wouldn't mean quantitative easing measures were unsuccessful: they were intended to avert a crisis just as much as to contribute to a recovery.
Look at this well informed comment who's position is contrary to yours! He should be pulling his head out of his ass with how misinformed he is and all!!1!!


Talking about this should require you to actually know what the hell it is that you're talking about. Looking at the linked comment, you aren't qualified.

TIL just one prison is needed to accommodate hundreds of thousands of extra prisoners and it must be built on pristine mountainous grassland. 
Thanks for further elaborating my point. What's next? Are you going to show me some pictures of farmland and talk about slum coasts and claim that there is enough space to build one prison because one prison is going to solve what these people claim to be a problem? It would be in poor taste to build every prison in between towns, seeing as how the Kingdom is densely populated.

I think you're completely overestimating how many people actually do forex trading on their own. The people who do serious forex trading are likely already extremely rich and can afford to take hits in a loss. Most Forex trading is done as a compliment/addition to an already established investment business or is done on a massive scale like a Forex trading companies do. 
Commodities trading is hardly a "nothing doers" job if you actually understood what they were doing.

I agree and I do. It doesn't make your previous comment any less crappy(obviously IMO) though.

On one side, you have a company that provides a reputable service that is used by millions of people and businesses, moving over $200 billion from source to source in the 2014 fiscal year.
On the other side, you have bitcoin and all of its, uh, merits...
It's not really hard to see why they would go with PayPal over bitcoin as a business.

If you knew anything about American prisons, white collar criminals ARE almost always separated from murderers and rapists. Were you under the impression that everyone was just lumped together? Heck, Bernie Madoff, who will be in prison for the rest of his already aged life, is currently in an exquisite prison long ways from the murdery and rapey prisons.

Well, you see, since speculating is a do nothing task, investors focus their energies on *other* investment methods. There aren't many speculators(if any) who sit around and *speculate* all day. They understand that speculation is hit or miss, so they do other things in the mean time. When you here people speak of "speculators", they are referring to investors who also happen to do some speculation. 
I think that this is what is referring to.

Oh buddy. The "did it" part is past tense so I'm guessing you learned that doing forex trading alone with a not-so-large wealth pool is generally a bad idea? In that time period where you "did it", did you realize why people typically leave it up to forex firms to do the investing for them?

Wait, what? Should inside traders not be imprisoned? What about Ponzi scheme orchestrators? In other words, all white collar criminals should be off the hook! Nice.


Yet, your response about prison population percentages was warranted in a comment that questioned someone's sympathies? Okay.
