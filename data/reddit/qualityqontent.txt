Thats great! Holding is a good strategy but a little outdated for crypto as it follows more of the traditional stock market style or trading. I am a day trader. I make a living off of crypto. So I trade a little differently but in the end it's the same effect.

Weekend warriors took us to 7k, great. Monday 9-5's will dump and take us back to &lt;6k. I'd rather have a steady 5% a day to keep resistence points stronger and break points weaker. But whatever that's bitcoin.

Right it's never gonna go to 84$ again. But you look at marginal drops in terms of percentages. For example a 100% drop in a 6 month period would indicate a practical entry point. (An extreme example) but currently markets(and more importantly trade volume) is oover extended. A healthy market will require a short term correction which will more likely come in the form of a dump from various investment groups and large holders(and soon). People who work in short term gains are not interested in holding until bitcoin reaches 250k. They are more than happy to have bought in at 2500 and dump at 9k.

Tell that to the IRS lol.

Lol. It will. If you're new to the game dont worry. Just wait.

I mean. To be honest it could be worthless in 10 years you never know what will happen. If bitcoin gets regulated it will decrease significantly in value. If a fork creates a better btc you'll have what happens with LTC. You never know ��‍♂️

Hey guys. Suggested dip below 6k to buy at? From a quick analysis myself I was thinking 5800. Any other ideas?
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:53:45
I've found it's not that effective.
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:19:33
I read "I dont trade". And stopped reading. Have a good day.
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:46:34
Lmao that's the worst advice anyone has given. Inb4 buys at 8000 and drops to 5200. Anyone waiting for an entry point wait for a good 1200-2500 drop and then buy.

I dont listen to anyone. I keep up to date with blockchain technology, updates, alt coins, relevant real world economical changes, and most importantly study graphs. If you make investments based on what other people tell you you're gonna get burnt. Educate yourself and make reasonable moves. People dont give things for free and that includes advice. Always be skeptical of everything and that includes my advice. People who want bitcoin to reach 250k dont like to hear talk about corrections and drops in price. Which is reality for any type of economical ecosystem.
