I'm not asking about the target, I'm asking about the "total work"  metric by which you would determine how "heavy" a chain.  Is this a number that I can just go read from the block header and say "this chain has seen X work" or do you have to just know the sum of difficulties going all the way back to genesis?  
Also I think perhaps there's the confusion about the definition of hypothetical.  The point of declaring a question hypothetical is so that you can sandbox your discussion and discuss certain details you find interesting without people screaming at you. That's the point.

This thread is hilarious.  People aren't answering the question because the cognitive dissonance is mind blowing.

Just for fun, I'm going to guess that I get 7 answers telling me to "read the white paper" or "it's been discussed already" for every attempt at an answer to my question.

is there a formula or can you point to somewhere where this is made precise?  is it some of target difficulties or can a block with a lower hash be consider ahead of a block who hash barely came in below the target?

I'm also curious, can someone respond to the hypothetical?  The exponential increase in difficulty only applies when you don't have the hash power.  If you do,  it would just take a little bit longer, but not exponentially.  The original white paper doesn't address how the "total work" is computed, and this doesn't seem to be obvious out there - is it simply the sum of the difficulties in all the blocks on the chain, and if so, is this information in part of the block header?  Can someone point to a formula or something?   I'm also curious - who cares about hypothetical maybe I'm have a quantum chip in beta or something.    People in this forum have a strange aversion to hypthotheticals, considering 20 years ago all this was just crazy hypothetical.
