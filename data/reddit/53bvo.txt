€50k is the max per transfer, you can do multiple if you want to transfer more, or go to your bank and ask them to raise the limit to a million.

I can transfer money to my friends bank account within 30 seconds, 10 if I already have is bank number noted. 
There are benefits to bitcoin but the ease of transfer is not one of them, at least not here in Europe.

What about the free market? If PayPal only wants to support cupcake selling shops it is their right to do so isn’t it?
Maybe you can call it censorship but private companies are free to censor how they feel fit.

I live there, but a while ago all shops cancelled that policy due to high transaction costs and transaction times. Guess they are back up and running again.

I checked their site and it turns out they are up and running again with around 100 transactions per month, and around €3000 turnover per month. You can check [the graph on their website](
Apparently they use BitKassa that allows the shop to receive Euro's or bitcoin directly while only needing a tabled. 
However I still wonder what the cashier at the supermarket will think when I say I want to pay in Bitcoin.

Oh wait I missed that part. Maybe she doesn't really know the true value, and just thought it was funny.

Not being used for massive data collection/advertisement seems like a decent benefit to me.

What kind of relationship are you in if you can't communicate your financial situation with your wife?

Even when flying subsonic the noise of the Concorde was so much louder than conventional jumbojets. 
Also people would rather save a few thousands of dollars by taking a slightly longer flight.

Soon you’ll have to turn that screen 90° in order to read the graph when bitcoin really takes off.
