@_date: 2014-09-08 22:25:27
It took me reading a gawker article in 2011 and reading about TOR and Silk Road and Bitcoin to get me interested, ended up downloading the bitcoin wallet app, but got nervous and deleted everything while it was still downloading the blockchain.
But I followed it for the longest time and was waiting for someone, anyone else, in my peer group to show the slightest interest in it. Finally I jumped in in 2013.
It absolutely takes like 2-4 people talking about or owning bitcoin to make someone normal feel comfortable taking the plunge. OR just 1 really trusted advisor, who's pointed you in the right direction numerous times.

Actually depending on which company, some have already worked on a solution, like bitundo, or insurance on your stored bitcoin, like Xapo.... So yes, as it ages, the "problems" for mainstream are getting solutions developed.

Sad to hear there were these complaints. I've been talking with the Texas Bitcoin Conference folks (who were also at the Miami conference and hopefully took notes as to how to improve upon the experience). Also understand there's a bunch of really cool stuff planned that has not been done yet and a couple of all-time firsts. 
I'm pretty excited about it now. Hope some of y'all make it out to Texas March 5&amp;6!

DONT OPEN ANY "GOOGLE DOC" FILE REGARDING BITCOIN, ENABLE 2FA on your email and everywhere you can. 
Verify that the person sending you the document sent you the document.  
This scam/virus has been sent using many different titles. From "Texas Bitcoin Volunteer list" to this one he exact same hung and many other iterations. 
Short and sweet: don't open google docs, always enable 2 Factor Authentication. This saved my bitcoins a few weeks ago from disappearing.

So i think I figured it out, I had gotten an email from someone with a googledoc attachment which i assumed was for the texas bitcoin conference. I can't find that email anymore, but I did add the person on LinkedIn before so I remember the person's full name i had received the email from.
That has to be it. It's the only email (besides the reset password emails) that is missing since before the attack.

You could even set up your own "smart contracts" that will allow anyone who "owns your smart contract/colored coin/stock/etc" to be allowed access OR some ownership stake to any and all of your future work. 
You should do your next paper on the sociological implications of Smart Property! Read up on some of Nick Sbazo's website and watch some of Mike Hearn's videos about Autonomous Corporations (DAC's) and their implications. Crazy crazy things. 
Also checkout Singularity University on Netflix or the campus itself. And read about ET3 or Elon Musks HyperLoop (prefer ET3 myself for numerous reasons).
I haven't read it yet but ill take some time to read the complete paper. Thanks for the contribution!  Post your public key or put a QR code on your website for us for tips!

Already people are developing DAC's to accomplish what Bitpay and cb are doing. 
Regardless of whether BP/CB are centralized  middlemen, they are operating on top of the bitcoin network. Which as we both know is a DAC. The bitcoin network follows Austrian economic principles. Coinbase and Bitpay can't get bailed out by the Bitcoin Federal Reserve if they make bad investments. 
As bitcoin becomes more liquid (more merchants and individuals using it or being paid in BTC) people will not convert back to fiat. 
Bitcoin also has developed a testing ground of sorts for an infinite amount of alternate coins to test differing economic and political principles. 
Voluntary association: bitcoin is only about voluntary association. No one can be forced to use accept value bitcoin. Everyone that does is participating of their own accord.

Hard to say without knowing the intricacies of their business model.

Wow interesting thread. It's great hearing/seeing these threads pop up with major companies wondering how and if or when they will become parts of the bitcoin network. 
What type of business are you in where you have the ears/trust of these high level executives?
Is the goal to bring these guys on the bandwagon or is it to resolve some of the initial fear of breaking into this too early and not having the demand or the infrastructure to support it? 
As mentioned, with what we know/understand about the bitcoin protocol, it's nearly impossible or extremely cost-ineffective to create a double-spend at this junction... Why is this an issue for poS guys? Just because in theory it could happen?
