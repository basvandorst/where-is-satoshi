Tell them you lost your passport, pay the £40-70 fee to obtain a new one.

I'll post a link when it comes up. I own the cafe where they interviewed myself and the co-founder of Elliptic. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 00:05:17
I think somebody already has! 
@_date: 2014-01-28 10:20:06
I did. I said that bitpay takes all the risk away by coverting btc into fiat instantly and depositing into my account.  No risk for me at all!  But they cut it out :(
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:17:28
Yeah I figured since all they kept going on about was the volatility, it was a crucial point to make.

@_date: 2014-01-22 12:23:45
Gotcha. This is exactly the view I take. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:26:59
Yeah I think the protection we receive in the UK is much more comprehensive than in the US. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 12:23:21
Ok I'll grab their info and send it their way. Again, im not sure what kind of angle these guys will want to take but I think its more of the consumer side as said. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 00:04:07
Nah Stratford. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 12:42:39
I'll tell them,  if it goes there,  it's essentially verifying the block chain,  which is like a public ledger of all transactions.  So everyone can see everything. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 09:26:02
I had no issues.  Go to your bank and print out a statement with your address.  I used my provisional driving licence 
@_date: 2014-01-23 05:50:41
ATM or simple vending machine? I foresee huge money laundering issues with bitcoin ATMs. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:44:27
Shit I cant remember whether I sent them a passport scan or my driving licence. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:57:46
For pennies. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 12:24:23
Yeah! 
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:55:20
Yep. I recently asked a communty on reddit whether there were any security risks giving a buyer my sortcode and account number so they could send my payment. I was told to essentially nuke my account and change my identity. 
Called my bank and they told me its fine. The worst that can happen is somebody will set up a direct debit in your name and that's with great difficulty. This is the way Jeremy Clarkson got 'scammed'. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 11:13:38
Nope.  Sawmill, Stratford. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 18:55:58
I got this photo from their twitter feed.  They were super happy and I was so excited I screwed up their order but gave them some free macaroons. They saw my post on reddit and dropped by. 
I use bitpay which allows me to use my phone to go to my page, enter the total in GBP and transaction reference and it generates a QR code which the customer scans (he had an iPhone and I an Android,  it worked well).  I got confirmation instantly.  The transaction took about 20 seconds and I didn't really know what I was doing! 
@_date: 2012-11-24 22:43:55
Edited.

[Minefield^referral]( has surprisingly good odds. Its kind of like minesweeper but with less strategy and mostly luck. 
@_date: 2011-08-02 10:21:12
Its not going to grow forever. It will plateau and then crash. The clever ones will get out when is best and earn the most money. the rest will lose everything in the panic.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:09:13
You guys are missing the point of Bitcoin. It was never intended to be a form of investment. 
Edit: having read some of the letters that have been written to send out to the press, I urge you not to. They are unprofessional and the BBC already has reporters following it, as do most major news outlets. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:35:12
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-04-21 16:03:23
I hope people stop panicking every time those behind the ddos try to manipulate the market in such a way. When the market stops reacting, they'll stop the attacks. 
1. Sell all coins while market is high
2. Initiate DDoS attack
3. People panic, price falls
4. ????
5. Profit!!
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:35:55
Thanks! I've just remade both signs and the revised version will be going up tonight.
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:08:21
Mine are always answered really quickly. Out of interest, what was your ticket concerning?

I need to get my deposit from tox back now :)
You hit the nail on the head: my intentions on buying were precicely those. Multiply my demand by millions of reasonably tech savvy people like myself and you get the reason for the price rise. It will keep rising but nobody intends on using bitcoin as a currency. This will be its downfall. Were all speculating in this game.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:22:22
Hey thanks for the info. By the sounds of things and replies from support, you should be able to withdraw euro via SEPA. I confirmed with my bank that it's accepted too. I might try again. If that fails I'll transfer to coinbase(?) And withdraw from there.
@_date: 2013-04-21 16:52:36
And repeat. Which is why people need to stop panicking.

One of the most widely circulated papers in London. Everyone reads it in the City.
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:31:07
Oh crap. Thanks for this!
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:37:01
This right here. I use bitpay to generate a qr code of the subtotal. I'll log each transaction for vat purposes

I recommend [bitcoin wallet]( for android. Deposit a small amount into it and use it to pay for stuff by scanning qr codes. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:55:03
I fist bought BTC to have a play around and to learn how trading worked etc. It is pretty difficult to get into first (send money to an account in Japan, paying hefty fees) But I did it anyway. I sold 6 BTC this summer when they were at £83 each. I learned what they were about, I bought some stuff like reddit gold with them, but then I graduated and needed a quick £500. Wish I had kept them now.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:30:55
This. Bring the downvotes.
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:12:10
Ok so what do we do? (imagine anything is possible)
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:43:36
I was in an excited rush to put it up. Here is the revised one. Hope you like it! 
@_date: 2013-04-18 09:33:48
Thanks. I figured as much. Dont want to be keeping my money in JPY when their govt is using quantitative easing....
@_date: 2013-04-18 09:50:06
Just another quick Q. When I log in, the only currencies available to me from the drop-down are GBP and JPY. USD and all the others disappear therefore not allowing to buy usd for bitcoin.  
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:34:51
I'm doing it through bitpay. I type in the subtotal on my android device and it generates a QR code which they scan and pay. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:46:27
Never too late. The reason why things like this succeed is due to early adopters. People who buy the first models of electric cars, first users of face-book, apple products and now bitcoin are the reason why its succeeding. Don't wait until it 'gets better' because it will just fail if everyone thought that way.
