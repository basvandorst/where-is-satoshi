Not a problem. Check them out. They claim to have 50% of the mining power in the world by August 2018. Time will show...

Cold air is not the the best option. Water cooling is far less energy consuming. The hot water can also be used for heating in nearby homes as well. And Cryptotech from Norway is poised to become the prime destination for Bitcoin mining.

Now I wanna go for the 100 TH/s pack!

With new tech and using cold mountain water they will greatly reduce the energy consumption. The heated water will even be distributed to nearby houses.

For $2000 you get 10 TH/s of SHA256 mining power valid for two years. Can someone in the know shed some light on this? What would one expect in return?

The mining facilities is owned by Norwegian’s in Norway and partly rented by a Swedish company.  The link was just to show that Cryptotech is serious.

For the fee, for fun and for participating in the future? It will make the currency that adds X% value a far better usefulness for sure, a safe investment it will become.

Best price on localbitcoins.com in Norway right now is $12500

The masses probably would. And that’s the folks we are waiting for, right?
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:52:44
This. It’s really not the same as hold.

Wait a minute, has anyone managed to send to a wrong address? I thought that was near to impossible. Won’t the transaction fail if you send to a nonexistent address?

Online shopping from outside of EU on EU shops (Visa cards from Norway may be declined on their stores). Quite a lot on Steam. Among friends for whatever (sent 0.1btc to pay a loan from my brother yesterday. He took it gladly). And of course just selling for profit.

I think new code will replace the Blockchain.

Nowhere to use bch. It can’t make it. To crash btc any alt must become universal than btc

Me to! Took a loan to buy a ford transit today. $17000 was the loan, and the bank took $500 to set it up + they want interest over the three years it will take to pay’em back. The bright side is that I will try to live in it, fuck if I am gonna have a mortgage for 30 years!

Thinking the same. Coinbase promises to give both and it’s easy to sell inside the app. Bread wallet betrayed me on the gold fork, local bitcoin betrayed me on bch, Coinbase promise not to do it in a email from yesterday. I trust them for the fork

This stuff will be a new mental disorder, it will get it’s own name soon. Maybe you should seek a professional therapist:(

This one is $1250 pr. transaction. And max $5000 pr. hour. And it may run out of btc. Also it clearly states that after you insert cash it will try to send you btc, but no guarantees. Plus you must insert a 500 or 1000NOK bill first, after that you can add smaller bills.

Solar power from Dubai and similar country’s are making massive progress, with power prices down to a few cents. Future is coming
@_date: 2017-10-08 08:29:56
I tried it, just out of curiosity. The exchange rate was $4800 pr. btc when it was $4250 on Coinbase. I will rather meet someone from localbitcoins to do cash deals.

Well, it says that you can make a note of the time and amount and they will try to help you. So that's something, but not $1200 reassuring. Weird thing is that my transaction never showed up in my wallet. I got the btc, but I don't know exactly how much and I don't know how to find it. I love the idea but I'm out until it's safer and with better transparency 
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:05:20
Yeah, it scanned my qr-code, I inserted my bills and received my btc after a nervous 20 minutes wait. BUT it is still not in transaction list in my Jaxx wallet. I can only see the last btc I received from a friend.
