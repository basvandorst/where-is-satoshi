I'm 100% simply because I kind of enjoy the thrill. My life was boring and repetitive but having that rush of excitement seeing it go up or down and seeing all the opportunities gave me another chance to live again.

For profit all in. For "safety" small payments over time.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:50:56
I also, fortunately, was able to realize my profits back to my original investment so now I'm technically risk free.

TBH I went 100% in August.  I since then have been making up my savings again in case of the worst possible situation. It's temping to keep pumping more though. What I did to satisfy that craving is set up a small time mining rig and have it get a tiny bit of btc a day.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:05:34
BTC made me enough to eat healthy again :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:14:01
I wont sell my BTC unless I have to or reach a dream.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:12:43
Bitcoin goes up in percentages. It doesn't matter how much you put in. If you belive it will rise in the future then you will feel profits.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:36:44
Makes it a currency again!
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:59:35
Something something edge lord. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:27:54
If BTC ever hits 100k I will have to pull some.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:51:17
Was but now isn't.  The gamble brother.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:27:41
For a lot of people this is a new taxable event and as good citizens we are worried.
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:31:59
It's a big dream... but ever since I was young it was having my own home. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:42:12
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:18:31
Same thanks
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:52:11
This looks like an ironic meme you would find on me_irl. I love it.
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:31:32

Unlike water this liquid doesn't have minerals that conduct electricity.

No matter what the price is you will still gain whatever % it goes up. If you believe it will rise then go for it.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:09:19
Wew it's an actual flaw we have to address to make our hodlings more secure.
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:00:44
Thank you for your wise words :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:53:52
A usb stick sized piece of plastic that holds glorious BTC safely :)
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:13:53
Well if Nvidia created an asci miner or efficient mining gpu's that would make em go up.
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:55:47
wew lad
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:05:47
I would cum.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:16:14
Exactly this. Although I have only benefited from this glorious coin, I fear of what may happen if my beautiful magic money took a tumble. Don't wanna bring another brother down by accident.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:03:22
Yeah! Save some gas money for more BTC!
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:11:07
It might turn to liquid the second it hits the air since it might cool so fast. Idk though.
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:02:25
They just need to pay tax and the government could care less. Percentages of billions sounds pretty appealing. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:51:58
Same tho 2 thanks me up proud. :))))))) ������������������������������������������
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:21:46
He basically means that new people with little BTC are much more volatile than long time hodlrs.
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:20:11
My girlfriend is the same way. She has much less in btc than me but she will always call me every $100 it goes up!
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:56:20
In some cases you can own property and have a business manage the tenant. You just pay a portion to the business. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:18:01
In a few years it will be!
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:54:32
Honestly I don't know where to post it. But keep on trying! I will share it around to my friends.
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:03:04
I'd say a whole salt shaker! But I can still dream! :)
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:13:32
Eh, it happens.
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:07:12
Ohhhhh I didn't think of that. Yeah it would be amazing if that happened!
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:01:44
It is a inside joke of a drunk post from sometime ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:53:34
17.76k actually 
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:08:05
Oh man would that be amazing. Looking at tesla like it's pennies. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:58:09
Maybe a lot of people check the price on the weekend as they have time. They either panic sell of pull out for the profit.
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:12:48
Mass selling makes price drop. Yes BTC to fiat.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:14:16
If you have a private key and held bitcoin before August 1st of this year you just need to "restore" your coins on  the same wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:32:36
When it comes to bitcoin hearing anybody put any amount in is exciting. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:51:18
$100 ebay gift card. Nothing fancy but was still fun!
