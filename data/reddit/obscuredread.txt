I took it serious. I was 14. I asked my mom for $20 to invest in it. She said no.

I don't think the idea of "voting on things" works when information is so easy to manipulate and filter. The advent of the internet has changed humanity's view of the world and yet people still think democracy is viable.

You assume that all actors in the market are aware of the politics. That is a very bad assumption. You also assume that the majority of people operating in a cryptocurrency are rational, long-term thinkers. This is also a bad assumption.

I have the modesty to believe I'm wrong about what I think until it is proven. You, clearly, don't. Why should I trust your argument as if your reasoning wasn't inherently flawed? Do you honestly believe you deserve that consideration?

If we want humanity to work despite idiots, then we can't have democracy.

Down voting doesn't let people know why they're wrong, so it's less useful. Your comment is poor because you.. just.. didn't really think about it. Next time think.

it's amazing that there are people this gullible
 I guess thinking that you're right and everybody else is wrong and part of an evil conspiracy is too intoxicating to pass up

there are people who actually think this

Why say something interesting or useful when you can just be a Redditor instead?

I don't understand how you can know enough about inflation to know "purchasing power" but not enough to understand that the government isn't stealing your purchase power. How willfully ignorant do you have to be for that kind of mental dissonance?

you really don't understand how inflation works do you
