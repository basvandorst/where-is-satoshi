No mention of Diaspora, the most popular *already-existing* p2p social network?

I'd bet on London instead of anywhere in the USA. The way that cryptocurrencies are treated as a commodity instead of a currency in the USA will become a significant barrier-of-entry over time.

And the first time they mine a block larger than 1MB (750kB) they will be on the new hardforked version and any transactions in that block  or any subsequent blocks in that chain will not be seen by anyone running the old version. That is the definition of a hardfork, maybe I'm not seeing your point here.

I question your ability to understand such issues, since you continue to claim that bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme.

Since the sole moderator of that sub appears to be shadow-banned, if you make a request for moderatorship of that sub in it's likely that moderatorship would be automatically transferred to you.

I'm not sure you are correct about this. Can you point me to some info that says they are still using OT? Are you a current Monetas employee?
@_date: 2015-08-11 13:04:39
Very cool. Another item you might consider stocking are a few physical bitcoins. Even the "unloaded" ones are pretty cool, could sell with a little instruction sheet and hologram sticker.

My understanding was that they are not using OT as their platform anymore. If they *are* still using OT, I might be interested in contributing to the OT repos, otherwise, probably not.

The problem is not only bad moderators, but a bad moderation system. What reddit really needs is effective *meta*-moderation.

What exactly does Monetas do, now that they've dropped Open Transactions as their platform?

That's some pretty damn expensive electricity. Where do you live, Hawaii?
@_date: 2015-08-14 13:57:47
It's easy to do actually. You just write a listener for transactions and match the recipients against a list of addresses for which you own the private key. If there's a match, you autogenerate a transaction spending from that unspent transaction output and submit it to the network immediately. It's just a daemon that runs and responds instantly, as fast as it can parse and do the thing. The only race here is to see who is closer in the propagation of the transaction across the network, whoever sees it first gets it basically.

Fact is that any pool that mines a "big" block faces an extremely high likelihood that the block will be orphaned or just not even recognized by a high percentage of nodes, and thus they will lose the block reward. Miners can't force this fork, because end-users can just not upgrade their wallet and then they just say "nope, you never sent me any bitcoins" when someone with coins on the larger block fork tries to send them a transaction. Miners risk stale blocks unless the hardfork is non-contentious, so they are sort of in a position of weakness to dictate terms here. They can't start mining big blocks until the network fork is completed basically.

Maybe it's dropping because you are all being drama queens about it instead of acting like adults who can actually solve real-world problems.

What do you have against Factom? This sounds a lot like a personal attack.

That was before he stepped down as CEO, by like 6 months, iirc.

Ripple and Open Transactions are very similar to what you describe here. Counterparty also has "asset contracts", some of which are used like stock shares I believe. Ethereum also supports smart contracts and asset contracts, I think...

Is that true, or was it just erroneously reported that they had made such a claim? Snow doesn't strike me as the type of guy to exaggerate the truth.

Well, since we're on that topic, here's a quote from Rand that is not from a work of fiction ;)
"I would give the greatest sunset in the world for one sight of New York's skyline. Particularly when one can't see the details. Just the shapes. The shapes and the thought that made them. The sky over New York and the will of man made visible. What other religion do we need? And then people tell me about pilgrimages to some dank pesthole in a jungle where they go to do homage to a crumbling temple, to a leering stone monster with a pot belly, created by some leprous savage. Is it beauty and genius they want to see? Do they seek a sense of the sublime? Let them come to New York, stand on the shore of the Hudson, look and kneel. When I see the city from my window - no, I don't feel how small I am - but I feel that if a war came to threaten this, I would throw myself into space, over the city, and protect these buildings with my body."
