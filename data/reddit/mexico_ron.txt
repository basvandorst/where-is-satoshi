Pool owner here. We were one of the pools you could choose from with the hashlets. Can confirm your theory about the lack of mining on the hashlets. We received ZERO hashrate from them. They made an account in our system and that was the extent of it.
He was also in violation of US federal copyright law by using another brand to promote his products without permission while the brand received nothing of value in return. This is why he continually skirted around the question when asked. I spoke with other pool owners who were also a part of the "hashlets" and they also confirmed to me to have never received any hashrate from him at the time. 
Hashlets were never more profitable than the pools. The "stats" may have said that, however the maintenance fees were upwards of 25% of the overall earnings which knocked the profitability right back down to the levels of the pools. Funny how that worked out. 
People were effectively paying him for hashlets in BTC or USD and then (very slowly) being repaid their very same BTC back over the course of 90-120 days. Add in the factor that people use pools/exchanges as their online wallets and do not cash out their balances to a local wallet and well, you have got yourself a guy sitting on a lot of btc that do not belong to him.
tldr; he was giving the illusion to hashlet buyers that they were "partnered" with the said multipools when in reality he was the only one aware of this invisible partnership. Sound familiar? (hello Amazon)

Not surprising at all, actually. He will draw this drama out until right before he has to go in front of a crowd in Miami and then back out due to feeling unsafe from the threatening replies here. 
This guy won't even answers questions on reddit because of trolls which are composed of mere text that he can simply ignore. Why the FUCK would he all of a sudden develop enough of a pair of balls to answer questions that he cannot screen beforehand, will be coming from people much more intelligent than himself, has no control over, and knows will be recorded live. 
This entire post was a ruse to draw out the trolls and give him an excuse to back out of going to Miami. The hashtalk crowd will eat up the reasoning. Mark it down.

Interesting, hopefully you can differentiate stories between the trolls at bct and the zombies at hashtalk. You're going to have spin flying in 10000 different directions. Godspeed, sir.

Did you buy BTC.com from an Asian company for a low six figure amount and then proceed to re-sell it to yourself, or another entity you own, for "$1m" a month later strictly for the PR that a $1m purchase would create? Did you have your friend, a domain investment blogger, also take the cheese on this for you and break the "news"?

I was debating becoming a sponsor for future conferences, however supporting a person that openly supports the fall of bitcoin prices to pump up his own altcoin  (see his twitter)  is pretty disgusting from the organizer of a BITCOIN centered conference. You sir, have cost yourself future money at the expense of what seems like a scam. I am almost positive I am not alone here, either.

what he said
@_date: 2015-04-15 04:10:10
Define "easier"? There are more "options" to buy coins, if that is what you mean. However, the hoops that you have to jump through to obtain them from these options have significantly increased. 
I have friends who have personally experienced issues placing simple buys through those 'easier' options. I'm not saying these sites should disable their fraud screeners by any means, however it is a massive turn off to the casual user.
It is an extremely simple equation; For every merchant that gets adopted there needs to be equal buy pressure on the other side to match their sell volume. I am going to go out on a limb here and say that no major retailer is choosing to hold any BTC over converting it to fiat. 
The next BTC bubble will be backed by the ability of the casual user being able to go down the street to an atm, hop online, or call their investment broker and buy BTC with zero hurdles to jump through. 
There needs to be a much greater focus on finding ways to simplify obtaining coins for the average person rather than getting all excited when a new retailer wants to accept it.

then he shouldn't have said he was open to theories 
@_date: 2015-04-14 16:52:01
One humble man's opinion here, but it is getting increasingly more difficult to obtain BTC than it is to use (or sell) it. My definition of "use" is in a retail sense. For every store that starts accepting BTC, that is just one more place forced to dump it for fiat. 
Until it is easier for the casual user to buy bitcoin than it is to use/sell, the price will not surge to the levels we would like it to.

they're fine for personal/general use and the btc option is great.
however, if you ever have any issues then watch out. they will not hesitate to hold your domain hostage to $200+ fees. their support staff is all outsourced to either russians or ukranians so the english back and forth isn't exactly ideal.

you're not. and as someone else already mentioned above, banks have various tiers for accounts with large balances where fees are waived. BoA, for example, has "platinum privilege" accounts which waives fees on almost anything a 'normal' account would be forced to pay.

Homero is a master manipulator of the truth. He just finally ran into something he couldn't talk his way out of because of the public nature of blockchains and very basic math problems that his customers can't seem to figure out but most of the crypto community has absolutely no problem handling.

I agree with your main point re: the funding mechanism being stupid, especially since they already are using bitpay and integrating it into their cart system should be simple.
I'd disagree with the auto renewal part though. They convert the coins to fiat value when you initially deposit. So, for example, if you fund your account with 1 BTC @ $250... you've got $250 in your account. If BTC prices rise by the time you fund it for the auto renewal then you're losing that value. Not worth it to pre-fund for autorenwals imo, at least not very far in advance.

Actually, it is more than likely true. You do realize that you can go check to see how many Paycoin addresses exist, right?
Hint: There are around 7,500 total addresses.
How many wallet addresses does each user have? One for their wallet, one to deposit coins to an exchange, one for paybase, plus hundreds of dev addresses they had to generate to test payments? 
I'd guess each "user" has 3-5 addresses on average and that is probably conservative.

or just not in their best interest if the end game is to run off with coins. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 01:19:24
well he can easily fake hashtalk shill accounts, reddit accounts, bct accounts, exchange volume, hell even mining "hardware". blockchains don't lie though.

Interesting choice of partners...
@_date: 2015-03-03 08:25:39
How does his shitcoin keep ending up in the "news"? There is absolutely no userbase compared to the hundreds of other alts. 1,000-2,000 people at the most, most of which were his existing hashlet customers. Enough of this guy already.
