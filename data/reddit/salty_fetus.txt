Definitely check out NXT and Ethereum. I would also add Bitshares as well if you are looking in to other things in the "Bitcoin 2.0" camp that have a chance of really changing things up.

What makes you say that? As someone who holds AGS and PTS, this looks like what I was expecting them to do, and Im excited to see the experimental networks up and running.
I think those of us interested enough to be nominally invested understand the following from the post

Why do you think Ethereum will dominate?
I have heard Ethereum say they can implement Bitshares on their blockchain as one of their services. Ive also heard Bitshares say they could implement Ethereum on their blockchain as a DAC. I think if thats the case, and it should technically be given turing complete languages, then getting something running first seems like it could be very important. 
Also, in general it seems like if one of these picks up momentum first, its going to be hard to convince people to switch. There are coins that offer benefits over BTC, but none of them can beat BTCs momentum, financial investments, and community (which grew because they were first in the space).

If you are talking about the Saturday evening reception put on by Bitshares, that was me doing the photography. I am checking with folks now to see if and where the photos got uploaded.

Nice, you guys are awesome!

Yeah man, I totally agree. I was interested when I first heard about Invictus, but Reddit convinced me it was a scam. Then recently I spent the weekend with Dan and Stan and the rest of the team at the Miami bitcoin conference. After a few conversations, I quickly realized that these guys knew what they we're talking about and are gonna change the world of crypto and maybe even economics with what they are doing.

I am keeping my eyes on Bitshares and Mastercoin as they both claim to be testing their decentralized exchanges soon (I am personally very bullish on Bitshares, but only after talking to Dan Larimer in person, that dude knows his stuff).

Next conference coming up in Vegas is going to be Beyond Bitcoin in June I think

Wait, did your boyfriend and I prom-pose? Because if so, that was awesome.
The only stuff I have seen go up so far is [here]( on the Bitshares facebook, Im seeing if it will be posted anywhere else.

Right. Except they have a clear plan laid out, an extensive white paper, have given multiple interviews and are open about their process, and will be starting a test of the network on the 28th.
Seriously? A comparison to BFL, a scammy hardware company?. Invictus is simply raising funds, its like kickstarter, except its a DAC. If you dont believe the devs can do it or if you think the economics are flawed or if you dont like the whitepaper, then dont invest. Its as simple as that, but its not a scam because they are fundraising.

Nice man, thats great! You are really in to Invictus yeah?

Sorry to be late replying, but briefly, the link above *is* a roadmap for BitsharesX, the first DAC they are putting together. What they are building is a system upon which people cane build DACs. It is possible no one will use it, but Im betting they will. Hence, I invest a little.
