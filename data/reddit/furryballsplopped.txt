The Wynwood cafe is the other location. This is the 2nd ATM that just launched today. The site will be updated soon with the 2nd location...keep calm and breath.

Yes. It varies on a spectrum between musty and shit.

Also same goes for yBitcoin which is sometimes the first someone will learn about Bitcoin...Gaw Miners has a full two page spread.

yBitcoin front page Spring issue...that was tough to swallow.

Because you are too high class for $10,000 in btc.

Aren't you the guy who doesn't change his mind until he is called out by Junseth and Derose - the same people he tried to kick out of his secret Bilderberg Bitcoin meeting?

BU is upon their last dying days.

We should believe Roger VerySmart instead 
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:04:35
With Roger ver or him?

I used to like BRD when it was still called breadwallet. It's gone to hell the last year or two.

Speed of getting started. As much as it is best practice to force the user to write down the mnemonic, it's not convenient when you're trying to tell them to download the wallet on the spot and they don't have the ability to write down the words, it becomes instant high friction. There should be a way to skip. The wallet overall also feels like it's for more advanced users. I'm hesitant to recommend it to a boomer or someone older like my mom. Any suggestions for something a little quicker and easier?

I will check it out. Thanks for letting me know.

What? That ATM looks pretty cool imo
@_date: 2019-12-27 00:35:20
Ridiculously cool. Bitcoin is going mainstream!
@_date: 2019-09-15 22:43:38
Looks like a scam. Very little history in business.

Just downloaded Hodl Wallet. Pretty quick and easy to use. Thanks!
