Hidden and decoy encrypted volumes/containers and OS's takes care of this wrench threat by having side by side operating systems or volumes/containers accessible with different pass phrases.
For instance, if I am under threat of bodily harm or death to reveal a pass phrase, I do not give them password  where they would get access to the real OS/container/volume... I give them password  to access the decoy OS/container/volume.
This is why I trust only secure Linux Live distro's and Truecrypt v.7 with my important data.
Crypto-currency developers should implement this plausible deniability, multiple pass phrases, and hidden/decoy functionality in their software and hardware products.
@_date: 2016-03-25 21:37:31
You don't know there's two pass phrases though. You only know here and now because I told you. When you get the fake one with a couple coins in it, you wont go away empty handed, though you might not be as happy as you could have been if there were 5000 coins in it.

I have no degrees in any fields. I am a tradesman. Pretty normal guy really, but I've been hardened over the years by data loss. Computers and devices fry. That's the take-away I have for any data. Since the 1980's, I've lost *lots* of data - various important emails, photo's, home movies, tax returns, address books, client lists, proposals and contracts, and even a few business quickbooks databases lost when hard drives fried. I've learned the hard way to backup my data. If it's important enough to save, I back it up.
I did a bit of research before joining the Bitcoin community, much like I research the hell out of every product and industry standard in business, so the very first thing I did with the Bitcoin wallets was to encrypt them into Truecrypt volumes and save them to cd's, DVD's, memory chips, USB flash drives, uploaded everywhere possible online for free, created printed paper wallets, and now I have also burned to three separate [1000-year M-Discs (now my preferred method of backing up critical data).](
Throughout my life I have learned from my mistakes, but I've also learned to never give up and to improve myself.
It used to be that computers were only made for experts using the command line DOS/UNIX/SPARC/AUX, but the Apple Lisa/McIntosh and Microsoft Windows uncomplicated that process and transformed that complexity for the everyday person. This will happen with Bitcoin too, to become less complex with easy-to-use GUI's, prompts, help sections and guidance for the everyday person. 
Just give it time, research heavily, create *lots* of backups to cover your ass, and *never* give up.

The perceived uncertain future is causing market volatility.
It will settle down as Britains slowly re-invest in their nation instead of sending their money to Brussels. Manufacturing and employment will slowly rise, the People and the nation will become better off, the middle class will grow once again, and the UK will start manufacturing more of what it consumes and create deals to export the surplus for profit... but for now, the big money is uncertain, because the big money relies on the EU.
Brussels simply got to greedy and tyrannical and the People revolted.

The Baltic Exchange Dry Index shows a slowing in world trade of raw materials. World trade in raw materials has been slowing down for many years now. That means world production, sales and shipping of goods is slowing down. 
Truckers (in those heavy semi trucks) pick up and deliver many of those massive shipping containers of raw materials (at least the ones not delivered by railcar), as well as the massive shipping containers filled with manufactured goods eventually made from those raw materials.
Businesses and individuals are cutting back on spending as our economy slows, so businesses have less demand. This has a domino effect all the way from the endpoint store to the starting point where the raw materials are harvested from, and everything in between... like heavy semi truck sales.
It's a sign of a slow, struggling and often declining economy.

Would you hold the same belief if the people you loved the most were murdered by the criminals materially-supported through the actions of enablers and facilitators like Charlie Shrem and his clients?
The drug trade is a violent game and places like Silk Road gave it the illusive appearance of being non-violent. I suspect that most Silk Road sellers were not non-violent hippies living in the woods chanting for peace nor singing love songs as they tended their crops and businesses. 
I suspect that most of them are parts of vicious and violent networks who will, at the very least, murder to keep from getting caught, let alone what they do to their competition... and whoever gets caught in the cross-fire of both. 
All we need to do is look at the violent and murderous intent of Silk Road's founder to understand this reality.

If your wife pisses and moans endlessly every day that she needs a new _INSERT_ANYTHING_HERE_, you're buying her that _INSERT_ANYTHING_HERE_... else you're getting a divorce and she will take you for half your worth, plus alimony and child support. Then she will find a *new* man who *will* buy her the _INSERT_ANYTHING_HERE_ of her dreams, or she'll pay for it herself with your money in her new home you are also paying for. 
This scenario runs the entire gambit of consumer purchases. Advertisers pay a lot of money to know this, which is why the lions share of all consumer advertising is geared toward her. They also know that if the wife or girlfriend ain't happy, no one is happy, so she'll get whatever she wants one way or another.

Why I will not be supporting the Johnson/Weld ticket in 2016:
* Johnson is pro-illegal immigration. 
* Johnson is pro-open boarders. His dream is seeing truck drivers wave to each other as they pass each other on a highway delivering goods to each other's  nations without stopping for boarder checks. 
* Johnson is pro-unregulated free market/trade, thereby allowing some 3rd world country - who pays their workers pennies compared to what we are *forced* to pay our workers - to import to us tax-free, while we must pay their import tariffs, disabling our businesses from effectively competing because of federal and state tax, employment, wage and benefits laws and conditions those employers in other nations are not required to give their employees. Before we can support a true free market/trade system, other barriers to complete and effective competition need to be repaired. We need as even a playing field as possible to have a true free market and free trade, else the money and jobs travels one direction, and that direction is out of the USA and away from US employers and workers. Give us an even playing field first, *THEN* I am all for free market and free trade system.
* Johnson only wants to legalize marijuana, but barely, and all other drugs he wants to remain illegal.
* Johnson claimed to adhere to the New Mexico State Constitution by balancing the budget, but bottom line is that Johnson inherited a debt of $1.8 billion and left a debt of $4.6 billion. During every year that Johnson "balanced the budget" he actually added to the debt.
* Johnson believes that social liberalism is essential to libertarianism, which it is certainly not.
* Johnson supports forcefully seizing your money to supply funding for Planned Parenthood.
* Part of Johnson budget includes forcefully seizing your money for government-funded prizes for science and paying U.N. dues. 
* Weld is a gun-grabber and anti-gun, therefore anti-Second Amendment and anti-Constitution ... 
* Weld supports and assault weapons ban for guns that are not even assault weapons used in war. A semi-automatic rifle is *not* an assault weapon.
* Weld believes in wide and increasing use of Eminent Domain, and not just for government project, but for developers and the benefit of a select few.
* Weld is pro Affirmative Action and believes that we should take from you to redistribute to some lazy person who does not possess your intellect, drive, ambition, hard-work ethic, nor dedication.
* Weld believes in the EPA and stricter environmental laws affecting employments, business, and your property rights.
* Weld endorsed and was a staunch supporter and advocate for Barack "Barry Soetoro" Obama in 2008.
* Weld endorsed Mitt Romney in 2012.
* Weld endorsed John Kasich in 2016.
* The farce called the 2016 Libertarian National Convention... need I say more?
These are just the cliff notes... there's plenty more where this came from.
The Libertarian Party needs to clean house and clean up its act.
If the Libertarian Party wants to enter my good graces again in the future, they must *earn* the privilege by reforming and returning to an actual Libertarian platform and belief system.
So, no I won't be donating to nor supporting Johnson/Weld this election cycle.

Miners will earn more transaction fees as adoption and transaction volume increases exponentially, which will eventually replace mining subsidies. By that time there will be many mining farms running on renewable energy sources already payed off by previous mining subsidies and transaction fees, so electricity costs will be low or nothing. There are people right now running mining farms using solar, wind, water and heat generated power. As we expand and improve chip technology and our networked world, mining devices and renewable electricity generating devices can be paired into many of our products and services.

Sure one could, but then there would be no immediate incentive for them to research and start accepting Bitcoin, and one would not be spending their money in efforts to help Bitcoin and to aid in supporting the network. 
This might not work for a conglomerate, but it might work for a struggling, new, or even a successful and thriving mom and Pop business whos knows that their success or failure may ride on a razors edge in this struggling economy.
Another way to do it would be to call around when ones needs someone to perform a service, asking that question when they give you an estimate for the work to be done. Maybe a Carpenter, handyman, flooring/window/wallpaper installer, plumber, painter, auto mechanic, landscaper,  etc.

Because you live in Croatia, Croatia has a government structure, part of that government structure is the Taxing Authority (KPMG | HR?), and under the laws for tax reporting (and paying) includes fair market value of barter trade, and trading your labor for Bitcoin falls into that category of barter trade tax obligation to both Croatia and the European Union, the latter of which Croatia is a member of since 2013... and lastly, because mean government people will bring guns and violence to you, throw you in prison and take everything possible from you when they find out about your criminal tax evasion (freedom, land, and any assets they can find). 
Now if you're okay with risking all that, then by all means, continue your genius plan.
If not, then you may want to move to a more accommodating and less-taxed nation... or obey the laws of where you're at currently.
Maybe Croatia even considers Bitcoin a currency (I don't know), in which case the tax obligations would *still* require you to report and pay. 
They got it all on lock-down. You can't trade value lawfully without being required under law to pay taxes, except under exceptional circumstances, and if you decide that you're smarter than your government and choose to violate those laws, the *last* thing you should be doing is bragging about your genius tax evasion plan online.
