just too much money involved for there to be a hole in the marketplace. Institutions, countries and businesses that hold out will be replaced by the hungry and aggressive. 
Same pattern happened with the Internet.

maybe, but they have also made mistakes, see their windows phone. the big corporate mindset is risk averse -- not a good match for crypto.

Yes, in the late 1990's- early 2000's the Internet was unproven. It was new, slow and risky for consumers to enter credit cards. Some traditional companies including banks, music, publishers did not participate or wait-and-see. New companies including Amazon, eBay and Priceline.com were born and took their place -- and their market share. I think we will see this pattern with crypto and blockchain.

Microsoft loss is TorGuard gain. They claim too much volatility in crypto. Meaning not enough profit for them.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:58:34
haha, yes I understand. History repeats itself.

and I thought it was just "betting against yourself"
@_date: 2018-06-19 09:24:02
And then the market gave him the finger with a $13 billion price spike.. [
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:11:57
manipulaters going to manipulate. let the buyer beware and do your effin research.   
But then there is this .. it's the HODLers .. LOL

The point is not store of value, the point is increasing adoption. There are multiple tracks to run. Distribution in all industries matters. Traditional musicians needed radio airplay, deejays and even payola. 
This is all part of the big picture of market making.
In the end the product or service has to reach consumers and in a usable way. This is what email did for the internet. Word processing and spreadsheets made desktop PCs relevant for consumers in the 1980s. This is the adoption curve that will apply to Bitcoin and blockchain. Being able to piggy-back in a useful way on billions of mobile phones is part of innovation. The article reads BitMinutes and Akoin are "token projects" that will provide the gateway for the unbanked as the title states.

only banks in my digital wallet
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:06:59
yes the bears are driving. only options are  and buy I think.

They may send another. I received three pending transactions and the last was less than $1.00 and accepted.
@_date: 2019-10-27 15:35:39
haha, that would be great. probably call it more hearings.
@_date: 2019-10-27 20:52:35
lol, yes please.
@_date: 2019-10-10 03:34:51
yes agreed!
@_date: 2019-10-12 08:16:58
who knows when they will be dead? really not the point at all.
@_date: 2019-12-01 21:25:53
Because there are posts about price does equate to price shoutbox. This sounds like over-regulation as we already have means to down vote, comment, add new rules and shadowban.  Let the market speak.
@_date: 2019-04-06 06:40:22
Makes sense. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:28:27
It's good to think big. One thing we see is that the global marketplace will find a way to fill all holes. The crypto and blockchain opportunities are huge. The need is great. And the biggest ideas and solutions for Africa remain to be discovered and implemented. Let's make sure Africans participate at all levels and not only as customers.  
@_date: 2019-09-14 13:28:09
haha, but the "Buy Bitcoin" written on a legal pad in the background is why we're winning!
@_date: 2018-02-10 08:39:30
when it was 20K people wanted 9K. Can you smell the bum rush coming?  
@_date: 2018-04-25 04:49:29
So easily taken off topic, no wonder there is high volatility.
@_date: 2018-04-10 02:24:53
haha, you're spilling the beans! These TA guys are funny. I saw a promo from one "expert" promoting his new "crypto profit extracting videos". I say run! These people are part of the problem for crypto ecosystem.  
@_date: 2018-04-25 06:44:38
I hope zero. But don't call it Bcash, Roger gets mad. [
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:27:23
LOL, he "bought it all for $100 on Coinbase ('a wallet thing') 18 months ago". Liar.  
Him, Buffett, these guys have no credibility on crypto.  Why is he speaking at Harvard?
