I am not american your assumption was wrong there. 
Also my transaction was less than 1000euro, in fact less than 100$. 
the thing is i am trying to purchase an item that is very limited in quantity (only 1 available as it is hand made), I am disappointed with their service.
all4btc is silent to my emails, and messages, i contacted them by phone their phone rings like i am calling a ghost company. 
very very disappointing for a site that deals with bitcoins.
I demanded a full refund at this point and still no reply from them!!!

they finally replied, and refund me in full. 
i think they are a small company and dont have resources to work full time. 
at least they are honest and refund. 
wanted to let you know

they did not provide any reason at all. they just said : please send your bitcoin wallet for refund. 
they didnt apologize or provide any reason. 
Also, because support was ignoring my messages, my last message was i am requesting a full refund

hey Berra, I am used to deal with bitcoin ecosystem sites. all4btc is by far the most silent, the most ignoring customer service i ever had to deal with. 
I did all the required steps, paid the right amount provided all the information required. 
I sent a 1st friendly message, no reply. 
By the way you can search it yourself, (i wish i had done that before ordering) and you will find many many many unhappy customers, on their facebook page (comment section) and in here on reddit. 
I demanded now a full refund as i dont have 1 day or 2 days to wait to process my order.
I let you know how it goes.

I contacted them by phone, several times and during working hours for their office, NO answer whatsoever, i called maybe 10 times from 1pm to 5pm german time, nothing, no one is answering the phone. 
I have been dealing with bitcoin since 2011, I mined bitcoins very early, and I am very familiar with bitcoin ecosystems, all the sites that deal with bitcoins have been so far very reactive. this company ALL4BTC is acting like a ghost company. no replies for emails, and no answering the phones. 
Now I am asking a full refund for my order as i am not interested in doing business with them. 
I will happily take by bitcoins somewhere else.
