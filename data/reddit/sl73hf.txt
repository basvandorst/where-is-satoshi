but you still support BTC even though it will never have full privacy?
@_date: 2019-10-17 13:21:15
Mixers simply don't work for BTC with any reasonable degree of certainty. Too many pieces of information are out there to do analysis with.
@_date: 2019-10-17 16:16:36
Serial numbers are barely relevant, it's very obvious that cash is highly fungible compared to Bitcoin. If you want to change your serial number you can just go buy a pack of gum at a store and get change. Even credit cards are more private than Bitcoin in some cases: at least I can naively pay a merchant without worrying about them seeing how wealthy I am, for example.

There's no "slight anonymity", you have to pick between privacy or no privacy. I find people like you terrifying that want a dystopian surveillance system. The popularity of this belief shows how Bitcoin has lost its cypherpunk roots and been subverted.
@_date: 2019-10-17 17:02:13
Yes certain bitcoin can be flagged and blacklisted, so you can end up in a very bad situation if you are unlucky to receive some tainted coins - e.g. people have had their funds frozen and had to give extremely detailed information about how they got the tainted coins and how they afforded them. It can be worse than visa since it is public for everyone.
You would probably like Monero, it is private by default
@_date: 2019-12-10 13:28:06
Much worse with LN because you could have safe coins and be paying a trusted recipient but the channel swaps your clean coins for tainted coins. This makes it much more likely for tainted coins to be put into LN channels as well, especially now as there isnt a usecase for mainstream users as of yet

Looking at legal precedent, if the theft of an item can be identified then it goes back to who it was stolen from. With private cash nothing can be done, facilitating economic activity. However with a traceable asset like Bitcoin or goods at a pawn shop, all parties should do their due diligence and refuse or report suspicious assets, then return the stolen asset if possible. Bitcoin isnt cash, it's like a pawn shop item since it is not fungible
@_date: 2019-12-19 14:41:07
That has nothing to do with fungibility
@_date: 2019-12-08 22:23:06
Scam headline, Bitcoin is not private, much better to use cash for "privacy and freedom"
@_date: 2019-12-19 02:51:54
Wasabi doesnt work in most cases, read the post. Many people always recombine outputs or receive/send their outputs to exchanges/merchants and compromise the privacy of everyone in the 'mix'.
@_date: 2019-12-09 22:41:11
Satoshi never spent his coins; if he did these days, people would know. The price would immediately collapse and all social media would go crazy even if he did coinjoins etc
Truly hilarious that you really believe Bitcoin is private
@_date: 2019-12-20 04:57:57
Nodes can log whatever they want
@_date: 2019-12-20 12:28:40
Nodes simply aren't going to risk being stuck with worthless dirty coins for a minuscule fee, so they will perform due diligence. It's like asking a stranger to give you their clean coins for nothing. If you find some node that "doesn't care about your coin taint" they'll probably be giving you even dirtier coins that will get you swatted when you try to spend them. This is ignoring all the other anonymity issues like how you don't know if nodes are safely running over Tor. In any case it becomes a matter of trusting a random central third party so you may as well go use any scammy old tech like Dash masternodes or something. It is not a cryptographically reliable privacy technology. Most governments also expect you to keep records of all your transactions, so people will have a huge incentive to log everything
@_date: 2019-12-20 02:22:02
How do you know you won't get wasabi, hack proceeds or darknet coins when you close your LN channel? That's an even worse situation. LN nodes will have to start logging their activity in case they end up rekt by dirty coins; it's not private
@_date: 2019-12-19 14:43:00
Yes there is a very dangerous lack of understanding about how there is no privacy and how risky mixing services are
@_date: 2019-12-21 00:03:34
Coinjoin Day? Tricking people into violating their privacy isnt very nice (since theyll have to fill out invasive forms when they use their coins, as seen with binance)
@_date: 2019-12-21 00:24:58
why do you think that?
@_date: 2019-12-10 17:18:33
You need strong encryption with a very long passphrase like a veracrypt container
@_date: 2019-12-08 23:59:25
The state apparatus has a wet dream over a cashless BTC surveillance society. This was originally a Monero meme funnily enough.
@_date: 2019-12-19 04:33:37
Sound money must be fungible by definition, but bitcoin is not fungible since it has no privacy and coins can be tainted
@_date: 2019-12-21 07:25:41
Not when you have to fill out forms like Binance asks for when they receive coinjoined funds
@_date: 2019-12-19 04:29:58
You have to trust the people you are mixing with
@_date: 2019-12-19 08:16:05
Mimblewimble is not a privacy technology, it's a scaling technology
@_date: 2019-12-19 04:28:49
sound money... bitcoin... forgetting about fungibility there?
@_date: 2019-12-19 22:25:39


Unfortunately not. Most users will always be very lazy and not care about privacy since they have 'nothing to hide'. Especially if BTC goes mainstream. So you'll be a tiny minority and exchanges will be fine blacklisting anyone who is a few hops away from a coinjoin. All merchants and exchanges will be using chain analysis software so those tainted coins won't even make it into the fractured part of the supply that is used by average people.


Most drug users are crackhead idiots that don't actually know much about tech, that's it. 


This is completely defeatist. If you give up because of fear then you've accepted that the future of crypto is mass surveillance and it will only have a terrible impact on the world. BTC needs to gain privacy somehow but following this same reasoning you would have to argue that it should never be added. If BTC became private in any form it would be in the same position.
@_date: 2019-12-20 21:39:19
Hardware wallet? Doesn't do anything to prevent tracing, it just makes it more secure against malware
@_date: 2019-12-19 01:24:55
There's no way, wasabi does not work. You'd have to involve fiat cash somehow to get new coins, but then you dont know if theyre tainted
@_date: 2019-12-09 22:47:16
Dangerous, you could get linked to tainted coins and get swatted
@_date: 2019-12-20 12:34:27
I can't tell if you're being sarcastic
@_date: 2019-12-21 07:45:40


No, I'm not prepared to violate my privacy by risking being subjected to investigation like this Binance user, and normalising that. If you're not prepared to accept that Bitcoin is currently fucked and Monero is the only thing that currently works then you're the one that's the problem. Encouraging the adoption of Bitcoin surveillance tech while writing comments like this is completely shitbrained. Bitcoin adoption as it is now will create that Orwellian dystopia. Look around at all the average people of the world using Facebook etc, they will NEVER opt into using things like Wasabi and manually controlling their UTXOs
@_date: 2019-12-10 17:05:52
so you keep your coins in your icloud
@_date: 2019-12-19 08:15:48
As soon as you spend any portion of it at a merchant or use an exchange that's rendered pointless.
@_date: 2019-12-19 08:13:16
Bullshit, gold is much more fungible and private than bitcoin. You can hand it to people with no record. You can melt it down. Any time you receive bitcoin there is a detailed record of where it's been that will never be removed for all history. Yet gold is still not money either. You seem extremely confused.
You can't change the definition of sound money, it will always entail fungibility.
@_date: 2019-12-20 12:35:35
Just use cash peer-to-peer
@_date: 2019-12-21 07:35:39
Completely false. CoinJoin is always detectable since you see mixing with many equal-value UTXOs. Even with Confidential Transactions you'd see the topology of many transactions mixing together. Wasabi devs etc have said this many times iirc
