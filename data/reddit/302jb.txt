Update, 
I went into the app on the legacy wallet and click to 'reset application data'. Closed the app, then reopened it, hit sync on the legacy side and the full balance of bitcoins are now showing. The transaction I attempted to make from legacy to segwit apparently never went through as it's now been 10 days and the check I did on a blockchain explorer was still showing that transaction as 'unconfirmed'. The only thing I can think of is that I was so cheap and set the transition to be just a few satoshi's (maybe $0.50 worth) that it was never going to actually get confirmed. Does this make sense?

When I exported the legacy xpub address it showed the transaction both coming in to legacy account (original large deposit) as well as the second (larger) transaction from the legacy wallet presumably to the segwit wallet. However, when i exported the segwit wallet xpub is showed zero transaction, not even the smaller test transaction that is still showing in my segwit wallet on the ledger app.

Is it possible that not all blockchain explorers are correctly showing the segwit transaction?

when I click "I don't know" it shows me the segwit wallet and only the one small test transaction I did. The larger transaction is still missing.

ok thanks I'll try that and let you know what happens.

Not sure if this is of consequence but I set the transaction fee myself to be super cheap as that is part of what the segwit wallet allows for however I'm not sure how this would be it considering I saw the transaction and the balance in the segwit wallet when I first open the app today, and only after hitting the 'sync' button did the transaction and the balance disappear.

I just checked the public key from the legacy wallet on a block chain explorer and it shows the transaction from the legacy wallet to the segwit wallet as 'unconfirmed'. I sent this on dec 17th. I'm assuming 10 days is a long time for a transaction to still be unconfirmed? Could this still be unconfirmed because I set the fee too low?
