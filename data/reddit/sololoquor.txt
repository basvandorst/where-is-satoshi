The vast majority of the world doesn't care about that. They are happy with international banking, the associated fees and are actually happy someone else is 'looking after' their money.
Once you grasp this you realise crypto makes no sense.

How long before the owner is forced to transfer everything they own or face being beheaded?

Yes, the vast majority of the world prefer to be paid in an almost universally accepted currency backed by the might of the US of A known as the USD.

That's exactly my point, ignorance is bliss and the vast majority of people are blissfully ignorant. To them, crypto makes no sense.

Yes it's really my money. Since birth I have had various accounts. £1 deposited, £1 withdrawn, £1 transfered. Any time I like. Physically, and now digitally.
Never had a problem. In my entire life.
This will be the same story for the vast *majority* of people worldwide.
Now look at crypto. How do I, as the average consumer benefit from migrating from the system above, to 'BTC', hot wallets, cold wallets, mining, decentralisation, exchanges, exchange rates, private keys, public keys, defi??
Please. Cryptocurrency is just a novelty for the original crypto punk / enthusiast perpetuated by greed and scams. A fucking minefield for the average Joe nothing more.
