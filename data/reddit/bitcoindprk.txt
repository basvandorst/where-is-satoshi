Actually I took that at the Schoolchildren's Palace in Pyongyang. Thanks for everything you do, Jason, you are awesome!

Fun story, I first talked to Simon after his first reddit AMA nearly a year or so ago. I sent him a PM on reddit asking if Koryo could accept bitcoin payment, to which he said yes. This is my second tour with Koryo.

I'd love to, but the internet is expensive here (200usd for only 50megabytes), no way I'm going to sync the blockchain! The internet is not censored at all, though, so there should be no problem.

I did use android wallet to fund my bitcointip account. An actual tx was made.

I flew into Pyongyang yesterday on the same flight as Dennis and his team. The game is tomorrow.

I don't know where I'd get a korean newspaper. I have a copy of The Pyongyang Times (which is English) but it is not a daily paper and my copy is dated from a week ago.

Nope, cells are allowed. Have my computer and a dslr here too.

Most people in Pyongyang have cell phones. Not smartphones or anything fancy though. Not sure if they have data connections or not. I don't know about people outside of Pyongyang, i would imagine the number of people who have cell phones is much lower.

Nah they keep pulling them out and asking me more about them. Guides get to keep the tips and gifts given to them, they seem very interested in bitcoin so far.

They reinstated 3g for tourists. I'm on it right now.

I made this account and funded bitcointip today, from Pyongyang. I would publish tx info but its best practices to not tell everyone your btc address.
