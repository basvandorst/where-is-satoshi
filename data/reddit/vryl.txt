Ok, so, reading the contract at: 
shows that there are some issues.  The Services are basically the MtGox website, and the Licensed Materials are defined as the IP of the Services.
The contract then ambiguously goes on to say that Coinlab have the use of the Licenced Materials to provide the Services.
But... the services are the actual MtGox website.  Coinlab have the contractual right to use the website, it seems, or another Coinlab Website.
This is a bit murky and unclear.  If the Services are the MtGox website, how can they provide the Services on another website?
This is not well drafted.  I believe the lawyers have confused Services and services.
Edit:  The more I read this, the more stupider it gets.  Services are defined as:  "...the digital currency exchange service operated by MtGox at MtGox.com...".  Later, it talks about the MtGox website and the Services as tho they are different things (2 F).
Again, the confusion between Services and services is what I think is doing them in.
The contract then goes on to talk about the licence grant in the section that defines the Licensed Materials, violating good [information hiding]( principles.
There is probably more and more.  This contract is bespoke as all fuck, and makes me think that they don't really know what they were contracting, and hadn't thought it through that well.  Surprise surprise, there is an argument.

Well and good, but it's a losing position.  This debate is old and tired, and was won years ago.
Attempts to conflate space stations and submarines to Gox, as pointed out previously, are not helping your argument.
Still bored.

Because, muppet, my bank account number is private and nobody else's legitimate interest, and security problems are not.
Your mistake, well known for decades, is thinking that because one guy has thought of it, someone else hasn't.
The full disclosure battle was won ages ago on bugtraq and elsewhere.
Bizarrely enough, publicising vulnerabilities makes it safer for everyone, not less safe.  By and large, history has shown us this is the only way they get fixed.
@_date: 2013-05-03 10:21:16
Ummm... where is the graph?
@_date: 2013-05-15 02:22:47
Consistently missing the point.  You understand the difference between private information, and vulnerabilities in publically available software and services, don't you?
@_date: 2013-05-05 22:32:40
Just get an education.   If you want to have an opinion, you may as well have an informed one. There is no excuse for ignorance in this day and age. 
@_date: 2013-05-11 00:12:25
How so?
The discussion is about vulnerabilities in consumer services.  You brought in the ridiculous idea of space.
If anything, you are trying to ratchet up your silly position so that you use case applies everywhere.
I have limited the full disclosure argument on several occasions in this discussion.
So be it.  Bored now.

Again, you are confused.  The vulnerability in a spacecraft is no legitimate concern of mine, as I am not a user of that service.  Nice try tho.
@_date: 2013-05-17 09:19:53
Bonus points if you get back to the topic.

I am not convinced that options and derivatives "smooth volatility", especially when they are unlimited as to the size of the secondary market.
If anything, they seem to have the opposite effect.

And you don't know much about being sensible in online forums, do you?
@_date: 2013-05-04 00:50:57
Full disclosure, my toolie pal, [full disclosure](
It's so good, even [Bruce]( thinks it's ace.  OP win.
@_date: 2013-05-03 10:32:35
Ok, so bad question.  Where is your analysis and data set?  Can we have a looksee?
@_date: 2013-08-31 09:40:15
Or maybe not.  There are an infinite number of strings that will hash to the same SHA-256 hash.  An unknown number of them would be ~2TB.
@_date: 2013-08-31 09:38:16
Technically, you could reverse that back to an infinite number of 2TB of data.
@_date: 2013-04-22 13:32:20
This.  Making petitions to be permitted to do something with a device you purchased is frankly embarrasing. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 09:29:03
Zerohedge?  Aren't they nutbags?  Occasional good stuff, on, say, the flash crash, but the rest of the time? 
@_date: 2013-05-03 09:48:41
$50M is the LD number for breaching the exclusivity covenants.
This is dumb contract. The definition of Services is overly narrow.  It should have included what the MtGox website actually did.
@_date: 2013-06-16 23:15:52
Technically, any finite number you can think of, or write down, is a very very small number.  Any number.
There will always be infinitely many numbers bigger than it.
Infinity is strange.

The internet is your friend.  Why do you think full disclosure is bad?
You think that no-one else has thought of this problem?
