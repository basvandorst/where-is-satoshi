So a 51% attack for spends more than 2 weeks ago is insanely more difficult because the attack chain will have to increase it's difficulty and actually hash even harder for an equivalent number of blocks?

To clarify, I never actually expressed any opinion about bitcoin or fiat. I was trying to illustrate that i thought the comparison was bizarre

Yay, let's compare the most inflationary currency ever to a massive post bubble correction, said this person

I think you are confusing the purpose of my post, I'm not arguing wether or not it's likely this will happen, I'm asking a question about how the bitcoin protocol works- there is a literal answer which any bitcoin dev would know, but I and clearly many others dont.

I didn't mean to say that you change the consensus rules which give rise to a new difficulty, I mean that the blocks on the attack chain are produced so much faster that they get their difficulty changed, and so the attack chain ends up slowing itself down but still produces more hash work
For example, you started an attack at 1 month of blocks back (4032 blocks), and have basically infinite hash power. You create 2 weeks of blocks (2016 blocks) in 1 minute, and then the difficulty for your chain adjusts so that the next block you mine takes 10 minutes. The amount of work you have put in is way more than the work put into the 4032 blocks of the main chain, but yours is only 2017 blocks long. Which chain is chosen? Both are 100% valid under bitcoin consensus, this is a simple question but it raises interesting implications for the ability to do a 51% attack from wayy wayy back.

But how about I express an actual opinion. Bitcoin is great. Blockchain is great. But there is an upper limit to how much value we can assign something which commands a relatively small proportion of use as a currency. Bitcoin has gained users but it has also gained popular media attention and extreme bubbles have resulted (not the only factor). The US dollar hasnt undergone a discovery phase in the last 1-9 years so ofc it hasnt increased thousands of percent in value. Bitcoin will plateau if it is not more widely adopted

It was to illustrate the concept easily. A large state actor could, for instance, create integer multiples of the current hash power, and possibly want to erase a bunch of super high value transactions and/ or destroy people's confidence in the system. Of course this might cost millions (billions?) in hardware and electricity. In that case it is very much plausible. Not to mention any alt coin that uses SHA 256 POW could be attacked like this by major miners.

While I don't think it's likely that Craig is Satoshi, I think it's pretty clear this was a joke and a deliberate dig at the people saying he isn't Satoshi, and so in and of itself is neither a valid argument nor evidence as to why he is not Satoshi. Something actually convincing would be if he displayed a false understanding of how bitcoin works, but as far as i can tell he knows his shit. He probably was even involved with bitcoin from VERY early on but the fact that he cant provide proof of keys and has displayed non-proofs is the best indicator we have that he is a liar.

No offense but you sound like a conspiracy theorist. 
You are all sitting here discussing the workings of the financial system as if it's some great unknown that requires debate and interpretation. Its not. Sure i didnt lay out the entire workings of debt and finance in my post but i was also factual and to the point, which is what we need to all do more of. People clearly made assumptions about my understanding of things i didnt talk about. Going on a tangent about how humanity should focus on what makes us happy and not infinite growth is completely irrelevant and entirely opinion. 
Thanks for contributing to the discussion though

Somehow, I make a post explaining some basic, well established, high school level finance, and people are debating the basics, 8 comments deep. 
Thanks for persisting

So If you say anything bad about decentralization and anything good about centralisation you must "lack an understanding". 
Decentralisation is not the solution to everything.

Yeah, i kinda figured. I guess my post should have been "be precise with your language". 
But if this were the case, and everyone meant to be talking about central banks, would this post have created 100+ comments going 5 levels deep of people debating bank fundamentals with essays of "so if John has 110 dollars..." 
@_date: 2018-11-02 07:57:32
How the hell did this thread get to a comment depth of EIGHT. Are you guys like, still discussing the basics of how banks work? Textbooks &gt; reddit debates

Hillary losing is not evidence they made bad predictions. They said she would win with 99% certainty, or something like that, meaning there is a 1% chance she would loose. She lost. That 1 in 100 event happened. 1 in 100 is not 0 in 100. If you had a 1 in 100 chance of winning a billion dollars would you not bother because thats virtually impossible? Ofcourse not. 1 in 100 events haopen all the time. You can only judge the quality of predictions by observing multiple predictions and outcomes.

Half the posts on this sub are nonsense. People didnt want to buy at 7k just because they like bitcoin, they wanted to have bought then to generate profit given it was currently at a higher price; and obvious and meaningless whim. It's like saying oh, I wish I invented bitcoin. At the present time, there is no garruntee we will ever see the same sorts of gains. This statement will be shutdown as anti bitcoin or something- but that's because so many crypto advocates are basically religious about their crypto- meaning they have belief about things despite a lack of or contrary evidence. Past price movements do not constitute evidence. 
I love the tech behind bitcoin and have owned the stuff, but if someone were to tell me I was doing something in the face of opposing evidence I would ALWAYS listen to them and try to think critically about my views. 
People are using how they felt at a particular price point as a motivation to buy or sell an asset which will have real consequences on their hard earned money. This is insanity. Imho, bitcoin has already had its major public discovery by mass media, which resulted in the 2017/18 boom and bust. This cannot happen again in the same way so something else like significant increase in use would need to happen to see a price moon.

It's not a bank... and it is it's own form of cash. A nice comparison of the other phenomenon but again, a fairly pseduo intellectual post
@_date: 2018-07-12 17:35:16
For fucks sake, it's not a prediction in the sense of crystal ball- its saying team A has 16.8% chance of winning which is the best next to team B with 16.52% chance. The actual outcome does not disprove the value of the probabilistic analysis- you need to look at a track record of many predictions and outcomes. I guess this sub just isnt at that level of basic critical thinking

Most of what I say applies to almost all of speculation, because speculation is almost always bullshit. I refer to speculation as random people drawing lines on graphs and talking about past prices as not the same as mathematics PhDs finding statistical relationships and programs written in assembler doing nanosecond arbitrage, and certainly not the kind of genius Warren Buffet fundamental analysis which can work with companies. The crypto community is FULL of irrational people all speculating on hot air and it's why I dont like advertising to my friends that I'm a part of it.
