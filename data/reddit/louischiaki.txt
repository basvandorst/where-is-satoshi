Because he wants to give everyone another chance to get on the rocket.

19k wall, HP = 408 remain

Bought too earlier....

BTC price haven't touched the 100 days EMA since Sep 2017. Maybe it is time for it to come back.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:14:12
I thought this dip will be deeper....
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:23:40
Didn't succeed. Try again in the next wave!

No, he is selling as a maker so no transaction fee for him.

Buy at Gemini but sell at GDAX.
I have no problem so far with both.

Korean Exchange was hacked

Free as well. Gemini is also free for sending and receiving. So you can actually buy BTC at Gemini then sell it at GDAX then transfer your USD back to your bank account.

How come the price on bitfinex get higher than GDAX and Gemini?
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:04:14
GDAX and Gemini are fighting for the 19k wall now.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:43:02
Man, buy at the top an sell at the dip is my life...
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:52:04
I am not sure why but I got email from GDAX saying that they can't verify, but then 2 mins later they send another email saying that they have verified my account.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:41:14
Perhaps he is the hacker who got too much bitcoin from the Youbit?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:26:45
This only works when there is only small oscillation about the price. You can observe this by monitoring the price in Bitfinex or Gemini.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:27:28
I felt he has been doing this again and again.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:48:50
0 if you use GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:23:48
Remind you stop order without limit is actually dangerous! Because you will not be guaranteed what price you get.
