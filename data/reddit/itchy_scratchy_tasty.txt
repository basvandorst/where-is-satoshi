Does anybody know if insurance claims are possible for fiat and/or coins lost in this?

Just gonna copy in my comment from r/bitcoinmarkets regarding bankruptcy protection in Japan:
























This is certainly not the worst thing that could have happened. Bankruptcy protection is not bankruptcy - there has been a minor panic but now that people are realising the difference, the market seems to be stabilising a bit. The Gox debacle is not over yet but if anything, this is giving a bit more hope to people who lost money.

I didn't say that I do, I was just putting down some definitions of bankruptcy protection because people were asking.
There is a chance that mtGox will survive in some form, it all depends on the restructuring. There is a chance that it will still go bankrupt if the restructuring plan fails.
Recovery, afaik, does not mean getting all debts back, but I don't know where everyone is getting half a billion dollars from - presumably the coins would be valued at the gox price, not bitstamp's.

The order depth problem was sorted a while ago and it is possible to trade again. It is possible that he is still trying to fix the bitcoin withdrawal problem so I am still hopeful that this is not a scam and just a 23 year old kid in over his head and trying to sort it. He's certainly never been good at updating people in the past.
That said, I'm all up for getting some pitchforks and torches. 
edit: I should add that I have been waiting a week for btc withdrawal, no transaction has shown up, although the coins have left my account, and I have had no response to two tickets

Where did you hear that rumour? There are also two other manes linked to Kapiton AB on merinfo.se, including another Manitski, surely they have some respoinsibility for this as well
@_date: 2014-01-11 12:51:56
Cheers, that gives me some hope that it's just a back-log and they're struggling to cope.
Thanks for the link, time to put my Swedish beginners course to the test

I'm, actually inclined to believe this, although maybe it's just me being hopeful. Sebastian is a kid who's over his head I think. From what I've found out about the company, it's just him with his brother and another guy working part time.
when was it that you received your coins?
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:30:46
I went through a similar thing with Kapiton.se earlier this year on a much smaller scale - people were baying for the owners blood, saying that he had stolen the money. In the end it turned out that he was over his head, and lacking in competence and communication skills.
I believe it is similar with Mark. He may very well be an incompetent wanker, but he has not cut and run like many have suggested and it seems like he is trying to sort this. I don't think he is the devil that many are making him out to be.

I opened a ticket yesterday but no response so far
@_date: 2014-01-18 12:35:08
Yeah I'm not sure why they bothered with a pseudonym - his names closely associated with Kapiton, everyone who uses the site knows it
@_date: 2014-01-17 13:31:20
If anyone is still looking into this - Sebastian has apparently broken his silence and talked to the Metro. Gives assurance that he has not fled, and that he is working on the problems.
and that he's very depressed about the whole thing, though I can't say I have too much sympathy for the guy. Just one update in the last month would have been nice

Bitcoin's place in EU anti-money laundering laws are still to be decided later this month in the [fourth AML directive]( so if Klarna are going to integrate bitcoin, then I wouldn't expect anything concrete until after that (in fact, proposals are unlikely to be[ agreed upon until 2015](
I do find it interesting though, that in a link in the article above, there is a letter from the European parliament president to the EC president mentioning bitcoin, and the financial stability commissioner saying that bitcoin should be included in the anti-money laundering laws. Depending on how all of this goes will probably have a strong effect on whether Klarna choose to integrate bitcoin.

I've been logging in fine until today
@_date: 2014-01-10 12:10:41
Yeah but I foolishly thought that they had sorted those since the order book was working again. Now I can't even get a response from the help centre.
@_date: 2014-01-20 11:41:06
I received my bitcoin payment today - it seems like Sebastian is working through those orders while he is waiting for the banking stuff to get sorted.
So it's not a scam - he really was just over worked and is trying to fix it.
That said, I will find it hard to trust the site again. Maybe if he can show that it's been sorted, the he has learned form these problems and that he is better staffed then maybe people will start coming back
@_date: 2014-01-19 14:14:46
Well this is kind of annoying still. 


Of course there's been rumours. There was no news for over a month and he's surprised that people got impatient. I hope the threats and so on weren't too serious but honestly, a couple of updates would have made it all a lot easier on everyone.
More importantly, what the hell. is happening with bitcoin withdrawals. The list of banking problems doesn't account for that. Six weeks for an update and he only addresses half of the problem - I have no idea how he thinks that people will remain customers of Kaption once this is over


at lest he was honest about one thing

It has a cathedral so technically it's a city. Also, by area it's the largest city in England.
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:13:55
There's also  although I've not used it yet
@_date: 2013-08-30 11:33:23
Ok, so I was a bit out of date. In the 16th century having a cathedral was associated with being a city and this was overruled in the 1907 and Carlisle was later regranted city status in 1974 by Letters Patent. I guess that's why Guildford has never had city status since it's cathedral was built in the mid-1900s (and I'm actually a little surprised to find out that Reading isn't a city)
